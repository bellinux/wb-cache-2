40|$|The {{relationship}} was studied between {{the level of}} the intracellular adenylates and the biosynthesis of tylosin by Streptomyces fradiae NRRL 2702. The adenylate level was observed to be inversely related to the rate of tylosin biosynthesis and hence the final concentration of the antibiotic. The concentrations of the adenylates were maximal during the trophophase, dropped quickly before the onset of tylosin biosynthesis, and remained at low levels throughout the <b>idiophase.</b> The adenylate energy charge was almost constant throughout the fermentation and was in the range of 0. 4 to 0. 55. Glucose addition in the <b>idiophase</b> suppressed tylosin biosynthesis, accompanied by a rapid increase in the adenylate levels. The biosynthesis of tylosin resumed after a rapid drop in the adenosine triphosphate concentration. Two enzymes catalyzing the interconversion of propionyl-coenzyme A and methylmalonyl-coenzyme A were found in this organism: methylmalonyl-coenzyme A carboxyltransferase (EC 2. 1. 3. 1) and propionyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (EC 6. 4. 1. 3). The activity of the former was two orders of magnitude higher than that of the latter. The activities of both enzymes were affected by the increased glucose addition in the <b>idiophase...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract With the {{beginning}} of the <b>idiophase</b> the highly phosphorylated guanylic nucleotides guanosine 5 '-diphosphate 3 '-diphosphate (ppGpp) and guanosine 5 '-triphosphate 3 '-diphosphate (pppGpp), collectively referred to as (p) ppGpp, activate stress survival adaptation programmes and trigger secondary metabolism in actinomycetes. The major target of (p) ppGpp is the RNA polymerase, where it binds altering the enzyme activity. In this study analysis of the polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) -encoding gene pnp mRNA, in Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 wild-type, constitutively stringent and relaxed strains, led us to hypothesize that in actinomycetes (p) ppGpp may modulate gene expression at the level of RNA decay also. This hypothesis was supported by: (i) in vitro evidence that ppGpp, at physiological levels, inhibited both polynucleotide polymerase and phosphorolytic activities of PNPase in Nonomuraea sp., but not in Escherichia coli, (ii) in vivo data showing that the pnp mRNA and the A 40926 antibiotic cluster-specific dpgA mRNA were stabilized during the <b>idiophase</b> in the wild-type strain but not in a relaxed mutant and (iii) measurement of chemical decay of pulse-labelled bulk mRNA. The results of biochemical tests suggest competitive inhibition of ppGpp with respect to nucleoside diphosphates in polynucleotide polymerase assays and mixed inhibition with respect to inorganic phosphate when the RNA phosphorolytic activity was determined...|$|E

40|$|<b>Idiophase,</b> the {{citric acid}} {{producing}} stage of Aspergillus niger was mathematically modeled to identify required genetic manipulations to optimize citric acid production rate. For this reason, a consistent picture of cell functioning {{had to be}} achieved. The transient <b>idiophase</b> nature was established by stoichiometric analysis. The main intracellular fluxes were computed by application of material and physiological constraints (ATP, reduction equivalents, proton motive force) at culture time 120 hours. The HMP pathway accounts for 16 % of the glucose input (carbon basis), the Krebs cycle for 13 % and the citric acid synthesis for the remaining 71 %. This profile implies an operative glycerol-P shuttle. It recycles 93 % of the cytosolic glycerol-P to cytosolic DHAP thus coupling the transformation of cytosolic NADH to mitochondrial FADH. A cellular maintenance energy of 3. 7 mmol ATP/g·h was determined. It would be spent in fueling cytoplasmatic (1. 4 mmol H+/g·h) and mitochondrial (1. 8 mmol H+/g·h) H+-ATPase pumps with efficiencies of 0. 65 and 1. 2 mmol H+/mmol ATP respectively. The role and extent of the alternative respiration system activity and polyol excretion is accounted by the model as well. In addition, the significance of GABA shunt and futile NH 4 +/NH 3 cycle were rejected. According to the developed model, the specific citric productivity would be increased in 45 % by an unique change if glucose influx were duplicated. Differences with predictions from other model that required many manipulations are also discussed...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 The {{effect of}} cycling {{temperatures}} on production of aflatoxin by Aspergillus flavus (V 3734 - 10) when grown upon various substrates was studied. The parameters of temperature and time {{were selected to}} simulate environmental conditions in Oregon during harvest of filberts and walnuts. The heat input required for aflatoxin synthesis in terms of degree hours per day were calculated and {{may be used as}} an index to predict potential danger of aflatoxin contamination. Conditions which generated less than 208 hours per day did not receive sufficient heat to induce growth and metabolism. When heat input ranged between 208 and 270 hours per day, growth and metabolism occurred with the development of a yellow pigment. There was not sufficient heat input, however, to induce the <b>idiophase,</b> sporulation and subsequent aflatoxin synthesis. Above 270 hours per day the culture entered the <b>idiophase,</b> sporulation occurred and aflatoxin was produced. The heat requirements for aflatoxin production was compared to the degree hours produced in the orchards by prevailing weather conditions at the time of harvest. The nuts are most susceptible to contamination and fungal growth during harvest when the nuts are damp and on the ground. During October and November, heat input is too low for aflatoxin production. From mid September to October heat input may be sufficient for aflatoxin production but at this time most walnuts and filberts are still tree borne and moisture in the environment {{is likely to be a}} limiting factor. A. flavus was found to be a poor competitor when grown with the natural fimgal flora isolated from moldy nut meats. On rice and nutmeat substrates, A. flavus was completely overgrown by members of the natural flora; even when A. flavus spores were present in superior numbers.

Some of these clones were further characterized by using them as probes in Northern (RNA blot) hybridizations. Five clones hybridized strongly with some polyadenylated RNAs formed during the transition to or during <b>idiophase</b> when aflatoxin was produced. However, little or no corresponding hybridization occurred with polyadenylated RNAs formed in early and mid-log growth phase.

No metabolic response was observed when elevated levels of inorganic phosphate were added in <b>idiophase.</b> Increased initial levels of inorganic phosphate suppressed tylosin production and markedly increased the levels of the adenylates, although the adenylate energy charge was unchanged. Higher growth and glucose uptake rates were also observed. The activities of methylmalonyl-coenzyme A carboxyltransferase (EC 2. 1. 3. 1) and propionyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (EC 6. 4. 1. 3) were suppressed by the increased concentration of inorganic phosphate.

40|$|A soluble, stable, L-glutamine:aminocyclitol aminotransferase {{has been}} {{purified}} 100 -fold from mature mycelia of the gentamicin producer Micromonospora purpurea ATCC 15835. An absorbance maximum at 415 nm indicated {{the presence of}} pyridoxal phosphate in the enzyme; its involvement in the reaction, and hence its location at the active site, was indicated by abolition of the absorbance maximum upon addition of amino donors, and its restoration upon addition of amino acceptors. In addition, inhibition of the aminotransferase activity by carbonyl reagents was partially reversed by pyridoxal phosphate but not pyridoxal, confirming the importance of pyridoxal phosphate for reactivity. The keto-acid reaction product of transaminations with L-glutamine was identified as 2 -ketoglutaramate, which exists in equilibrium with the inactive lactam, 2 -hydroxy- 5 -oxoproline. Substrate specificity studies indicated that this aminotransferase is distinct from the commonly encountered aminotransferases since it did not readily catalyze transaminations with L-glutamate, L-aspartate, L-alanine, 2 -ketoglutarate, oxaloacetate, or pyruvate. Active as amino donors were N(' 3) -methyl- 2 -deoxystreptamine, 2 -deoxystreptamine, streptamine, scyllo-inosamine, and L-glutamine. Active as amino acceptors were scyllo-inosose, D,L-epi-inosose, and 2 -ketoglutaramate. This aminotransferase preparation was able to catalyze transaminations which are compatible with both aminotransferase steps in the 2 -deoxystreptamine biosynthetic pathway. Appearance of the enzyme during growth of M. purpurea, plus the substrate specificity, indicated that this aminotransferase is an <b>idiophase</b> enzyme, specific for 2 -deoxystreptamine biosynthesis. A 2 -deoxystreptamine-less idiotroph, M. purpurea ATCC 31119, was examined and found to be an excellent alternative source for the purification of this aminotransferase. The L-glutamine:aminocyclitol aminotransferase from crude extracts of <b>idiophase</b> cells of the neomycin producer, Streptomyces fradiae ATCC 10745, exhibited a substrate specificity {{very similar to that}} of the aminotransferase from M. purpurea. In addition, a 2 -ketoglutaramate-hydrolyzing amidase activity was identified in both M. purpurea and S. fradiae.

Initial addition of CH to the production medium resulted in slightly lower synthesis rates of two of the proteins (CR 1 and CR 2), while significantly delaying the onset of synthesis of the other two (CR 3 and C 4). Finally, neutral polymetric resin was added to the fermentation to alleviate feedback regulation of CH synthesis, giving roughly a twofold increase in the antibiotic production rate.

40|$|Protein {{secretion}} {{and growth}} were investigated in Phanerochaete chrysosporium by using cultures sandwiched between perforated polycarbonate membranes. Labelling of colonies with radioactive N-acetylglucosamine and L-methionine indicated a close correlation between growth and general protein secretion, {{even in a}} central area of the colony secreting the <b>idiophase</b> enzymes lignin peroxidase (LiP) and manganese-dependent lignin peroxidase (MnP). Comparison of the sites of release into the medium of newly synthesized proteins and immuno-detected lignin peroxidases suggested that diffusion of the enzymes from the walls was a limiting step in the release of peroxidases into the medium. Microautoradiography of colonies exposed to N-acetyl[H- 3]glucosamine revealed the apical growth of thin hyphae and branches (4 to 5 mum diameter on average) in the central secreting area. These secondary hyphae showed peroxidase activity and reacted with lignin peroxidase antibodies. Although {{it was not possible}} to directly visualize secretion at hyphal tips, the results suggest that peroxidases (LiP and MnP) are initially secreted at the apex of secondary growing hyphae and later slowly released into the surrounding medium...|$|E

An extracellular fraction containing protein purified from a C. versicolor culture solubilized leonardite in vitro. Expression of the activity did not require the presence of leonardite and appeared during <b>idiophase.</b> During ion-exchange and gel filtration column chromatography, leonardite-biosolubilizing activity eluted with syringaldazine oxidase activity and with protein, as measured by A 280 and the biuret protein assay. Syringaldazine is a substrate of the polyphenol oxidase formed by C. versicolor. Comparison of leonardite-biosolubilizing activity {{with the effects of}} chelators and surface-active agents on leonardite showed that biosolubilization was not due to either surfactant or chelating ability. Heat treatment of the preparation at 60 °C for 30 min significantly reduced both syringaldazine oxidase and leonardite-biosolubilizing activities. Cyanide, azide, and thioglycolate, which are known inhibitors of syringaldazine oxidase activity of C. versicolor, also inhibited leonardite biosolubilization. From these data, we conclude that the purified protein fraction from C. versicolor contains a syringaldazine oxidase activity that participates in leonardite biosolubilization by enzymatic action...|$|E
40|$|Factors {{affecting}} candicidin synthesis and mycelial {{growth of}} Streptomyces griseus IMRU 3570 were studied.

Zinc, iron, and magnesium ions stimulated candicidin synthesis at relatively high concentrations in a complex medium {{but not in a}} synthetic medium. No other factors studied, such as temperature, oxygen absorption rate, and sugar concentration, were found to differentially affect antibiotic synthesis and mycelial growth. Optimum concentration of inorganic phosphate for candicidin synthesis in a chemically defined medium was found to be between 5 × 10 − 5 and 5 × 10 − 4 M. The culture in <b>idiophase</b> stage can be reverted to typical trophophase growth by the addition of inorganic phosphate, suggesting the controlling role of inorganic phosphate in repression and derepression of secondary metabolic and primary metabolic activity of the culture. With a soya peptone-glucose medium, the maximum rate of candicidin production could be maintained and extended for a considerable length of time by controlling the culture pH at 8. 0, using glucose to adjust the pH during the later stages of a batch fermentation.

This study {{was performed to}} investigate the possibility of B. adusta R 59 to synthesize enzymes participating in decay of wood compounds (including lignin, celluloses, hemicelluloses and lipids). Geotrichum-like strain, anamorphic stadium of B. adusta, white-rot fungus, was isolated from soil. It was found to completely decolorize and degrade 10 % daunomycin post-production effluent during 10 days of incubation at 26 ℃. R 59 strain produces only small activities of lignolytic enzymes when grown on wheat straw or beech sawdust-containing media but {{in the presence of}} humic acids derived from brown coal synthesizes significant activities of laccase and lipase. This phenomenon was coupled with entering the <b>idiophase</b> by this fungus and appearance of aerial mycelium.

The decolourisation capability of Pycnoporus sanguineus MUCL 41582 (PS 7), which produces laccases as the main oxidative enzyme, was assayed and compared with the decolourisation capability of a control strain, Pycnoporus cinnabarinus MUCL 39533 (PC 330) described as laccase-deficient strain. In absence of dye, laccase activity was observed during the trophophase and the <b>idiophase</b> with PS 7, while no laccase activity was observed with PC 330. Acid Blue 62 (ABu 62), Acid Blue 281 (ABu 281) and Reactive Blue 19 (RBu 19) caused an increase in laccase activity and surprisingly laccase activity was detected with PC 330. In vitro, oxidation of all three anthraquinones by a laccase preparation was obtained {{to a lesser extent}} than the whole cell process; suggesting that other factor(s) could be required for a complete decolourisation. As the time space of laccase production in the tested fungi was not perfectly coincidental with the decolourisation process, the activity of cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) was monitored. Present early in the broth during the growth of the fungi, CDH displayed in vitro a synergism with laccases in the decolourisation of ABu 62, and an antagonism with laccases in the decolourisation of ABu 281 and RBu 19.

The enzymatic activity was maximally obtained in <b>idiophase,</b> and the optimum C/N ratio was 24. High C/N ratios repressed the enzymatic activity, and addition of veratryl alcohol had no effect on the production of enzyme. The enzyme was purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation, Sephacryl S- 200 HR chromatography, DEAE Sepharose CL- 6 B chromatography, and Mono Q chromatography. The purification of RBBR decolorizing peroxidase, as judged by the final specific activity of 6. 00 U/mg, was 54. 5 -fold, with a yield of 9. 9 %. The molecular mass of the native enzyme determined by gel permeation chromatography was found to be about 73 kDa. Sodium dodecyl sulfate- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the enzyme was a monomer with a molecular mass of 71 kDa. The enzyme was optimally active at pH 3. 0 to 3. 5 and at 25 °C. Under standard assay conditions, the apparent K(m) values of the enzyme toward RBBR and H 2 O 2 were 10. 99 and 32. 97 μM, respectively. The enzyme had affinity toward various phenolic compounds and artificial dyes, and it was inhibited by Na 2 S 2 O 5, potassium cyanide, NaN 3, and cysteine.

40|$|Chloromethane (CH 3 Cl), a gaseous {{natural product}} {{released}} as a secondary metabolite by many woodrotting fungi {{of the family}} Hymenochaetaceae, {{has been shown to}} act as a methyl donor for biosynthesis of methyl esters of benzoic and furoic acid in the primary metabolism of Phellinus pomaceus. The broad-specificity methylating system could esterify a wide range of aromatic and aliphatic acids. In addition to CH 3 Cl, both bromo- and iodomethanes acted as methyl donors. Methylation did not appear to proceed via methanol or a coenzyme A intermediate. The initial growth-related accumulation of methyl benzoate during culture of P. pomaceus was paralleled by an increase in activity of the methylating system in the mycelium. Changes in percent incorporation of C 2 H 3 from exogenous C 2 H 3 Cl during growth indicated that although utilization of CH 3 Cl was initially closely coupled to biosynthesis of the compound, the system became less tightly channeled later in growth. This phase coincided with release of gaseous CH 3 Cl by the fungus. A biochemically distinct CH 3 Cl-utilizing system capable of methylating phenols and thiophenol was also identified in the fungus, but in contrast with the carboxylic acid-methylating system, it attained maximum activity in the <b>idiophase.</b> Preliminary investigations of a non-CH 3 Cl-releasing fungus, Fomitopsis pinicola, have shown the presence of a CH 3 Cl-utilizing system capable of methylating benzoic acid, suggesting that CH 3 Cl biosynthesis may occur in non-hymenochaetaceous fungi. Halogenated compounds hitherto found in nature are mainly stable end products of metabolism.
