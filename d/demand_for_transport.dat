The <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>transport</b> infrastructure and services was rising, but the Soviet authorities proved to be unable to meet the growing demand of the people.

The roads programme was scaled back to half its previous size mainly because of poor public finances, and urban regeneration became much more locally driven through [...] "Strategic Plans". Although many public policies and transport planners have promoted the creation of capacity-oriented solutions, organisations such as The Urban Motorways Committee (1972) adopted the need to respect the urban fabric.

[...] There the Hunt operated on the route from Portland, Oregon to the lower Cascades in command of Capt. John Wolf. [...] On the Columbia, Hunt was part of a chain of steamers that transported traffic between the portages around the rapids at the Cascades of the Columbia and the second longer set of rapids to the east of The Dalles. [...] Each set of rapids enforced a requirement to portage traffic around the obstacle and control of the portages and ready transport across them was the key to control of the river traffic. [...] Hunts role in this system was to carry traffic up to the first portage at the Lower Cascades. [...] She continued running on the Columbia until 1869, and during that time enjoyed a flourishing business, repeatedly carrying from 50 to 300 passengers, 100 head of stock and plenty of freight on a single trip. Her operating costs were high, but the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>transport</b> on the Columbia during the 1860s was so great that she was a very profitable boat.

The <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> petroleum <b>transport</b> is a derived demand, since movement of petroleum products results from decisions made in other sections of the economy concerning production, consumption and sales of goods and services. These decisions may {{have little to do with}} petroleum transport, but lead to the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> petroleum and hence <b>for</b> petroleum <b>transport.</b> Petroleum products and petroleum transport are related because anything that affects the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> petroleum products also affects the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> petroleum <b>transport.</b> However, the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> petroleum <b>transport</b> may be affected without affecting the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> the petroleum products themselves, since technological, regulatory and other charges may affect the way in which the distribution task is carried out.
