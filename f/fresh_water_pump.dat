40|$|This study {{examines}} the fresh and flushing water pump installations for high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong {{in terms of}} system availability, mean time to failure, {{mean time between failures}} and restoration time. Together with some reliability data published elsewhere, it applies Bayesian analysis to improve our understanding of the downtime characteristics of water pump installations. For three consecutive years (2005 - 2007), water pump failures in 46 typical high-rise residential buildings were recorded to determine the component failure rates. In order to study the failure patterns, Monte Carlo simulations were performed for the operations of 100 parallel pump sets over a period of 10 years. The mean time to failure, total downtime, failure counts and system availability estimated for the <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> <b>pump</b> installations were 1. 24 years, 8990 h, 709 and 90 % while those estimated for the flushing seawater pump installations were 0. 46 years, 4049 h, 2081 and 78 %, respectively. The results are useful in the calculation of water supply availability for high-rise residential buildings while keeping the balance between maintenance cost and system reliability. This study also demonstrates a method for reliability modelling of water supply for high-rise residential buildings. Practical applications: This study demonstrates a method for reliability modelling of building services systems. With the use of Bayesian analysis, example estimates of the mean time to failure, total downtime, failure counts and system availability were determined for the fresh and flushing water pump installations for high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong.

40|$|A {{groundwater}} {{investigation was}} undertaken at Ngukurr between September 2006 and September 2007. The {{aim of the}} project was to locate a viable groundwater supply for the Ngukurr community. The salinity levels of the current supply have been progressively increasing since the borefield was established in 1967. Water Resources Branch drilled 22 investigation bores in total. Eight were constructed as observation bores and three as production bores. The current Ngukurr borefield is situated in Proterozoic Nathan Group sediments at the contact between the basal sandstones of the Yalwarra Volcanics and the weathered dolomite in the upper Knuckey Formation. Connection to the Roper River has prevented significant drawdown of the borefield but high pump rates have drawn river water through saline palaeochannels resulting in poor water quality. Water from the borefield had a conductivity of 2010 µS/cm (TDS = 1350 mg/L) in October, 2006. <b>Fresh</b> <b>water</b> <b>pumped</b> directly from the Roper River is blended with groundwater during the dry season to reduce the salinity.

To achieve sustainable water quality at Ngukurr Borefield the pumping rate needs to be reduced to a level less than the annual recharge. The demand on the borefield can be reduced by equipping further production bores and pumping each at a lower rate.

25|$|The unevaporated {{seawater}} in an evaporator gradually {{becomes a}} concentrated brine and, like the early steam boilers with seawater feed, this brine must be intermittently blown down every {{six to eight}} hours and dumped overboard. Early evaporators were simply mounted high-up and dumped their brine by gravity. As the increasing complexity of surface condensers demanded better feedwater quality, a pump {{became part of the}} evaporator equipment. This pump had three combined functions as a seawater feed <b>pump,</b> a <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> delivery <b>pump</b> and a brine extraction pump, each of progressively smaller capacity. The brine salinity was an important factor in evaporator efficiency: too dense encouraged scale formation, but too little represented a waste of heated seawater. The optimum operating salinity was thus fixed at three times that of seawater, and so the brine pump had to remove at least one third of the total feedwater supply rate. These pumps resembled the steam-powered reciprocating feedwater pumps already in service. They were usually produced by the well-known makers, such as G & J Weir. Vertical and horizontal pumps were used, although horizontal pumps were favoured as they encouraged the de-aeration of feedwater. Electrically powered rotary centrifugal pumps were later adopted, as more efficient and more reliable. There were initial concerns whether these would be capable of pumping brine against the vacuum of the evaporator and so there was also a transitional type where a worm gear-driven plunger pump for brine was driven from the rotary shaft.|$|R
