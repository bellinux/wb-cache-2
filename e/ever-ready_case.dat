50|$|In October 1981, Pentax made {{available}} 300 limited edition Pentax LX Gold cameras to celebrate having produced 10 million SLR cameras, the first camera manufacturer {{to reach that}} milestone according to the accompanying certificate. The camera and its SMC 1:1.2 50 mm lens is partly gold plated and partly covered in brown reptile skin, while some details are made of brown plastic, and it came with a brown <b>ever-ready</b> <b>case.</b> Cameras for some markets such as the U.S. have brown leather instead of reptile skin supposedly due to import laws. The actual number of cameras made is somewhat higher than 300 since a few were retained at Pentax reserved for their own use. The actual number for sale however was 300 cameras according to Pentax in Tokyo. It is a superb example of Japanese camera workmanship.|$|E
50|$|The Standard in {{its basic}} version {{is not a}} {{rangefinder}} camera. However, the black enamelled FOKOS short base rangefinder was made available from the start, {{as well as a}} higher <b>ever-ready</b> <b>case</b> accommodating it. The measured subject distance using the rangefinder must be set on the lens' distance scale manually. Some Standard cameras were assembled at Leitz New York during the 1940s from spare parts using Leica III body shells and equipped them with Wollensak lenses. Standard cameras imported from Germany later were also sold with Wollensak lenses. As with all early Leica cameras, Ernst Leitz, Wetzlar offered upgrading customers' cameras when new features were introduced during the course of product development, and it was even possible to upgrade to other models as well. This practice in consequence makes the early models in original condition quite scarce, especially the Standard that has fewer features than the later models and therefore {{is more likely to be}} upgraded.|$|E
50|$|A whole {{array of}} {{accessories}} could be utilized with SX-70 cameras, {{such as a}} close-up lens (1:1 @ 5 inches), electrical remote shutter release, tripod mount and an <b>Ever-Ready</b> carrying <b>case</b> that hung from the neck and unfolded {{in concert with the}} camera.|$|R
