The following day, the song premiered on Fantasia’s Vevo channel, and explicit and clean versions were digitally released at the iTunes Store. It was Fantasia's first release after joining Primary Wave Music. According to the singer, [...] "No Time for It" [...] was chosen by her label as the album's first single. She was initially hesitant about releasing the song ("At first I was thinking, 'Is that a record to come back with?), but she later said that it [...] "set the atmosphere" [...] for her future singles. Fantasia was critical of the single, describing it as a [...] "very cute record", but felt connected to its message. She had favored [...] "Sleeping with the One I Love" [...] (2016) as the album's lead single. According to the singer, she would not record anything without feeling a personal connection and the album's recording process was all about [...] "artistic fulfillment".

[...] The Spectator felt the collection was [...] "in the running for the best published in this country since the war"; G. S. Fraser, referring to Larkin's perceived association with The Movement felt that Larkin exemplified [...] "everything that is good in this 'new movement' and none of its faults". The TLS called him [...] "a poet of quite exceptional importance", and in June 1956 the Times Educational Supplement was fulsome: [...] "As native as a Whitstable oyster, as sharp an expression of contemporary thought and experience as anything written in our time, as immediate in its appeal as the lyric poetry of an earlier day, {{it may well be}} regarded by posterity as a poetic monument that marks the triumph over the formless mystifications of the last twenty years. With Larkin poetry <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> back to the middlebrow public."
