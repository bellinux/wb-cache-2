5|$|On February 3, 1969, Eduardo Mondlane {{was killed}} by {{explosives}} smuggled into his locale. Many sources state that, {{in an attempt to}} rectify the situation in Mozambique, the Portuguese secret police assassinated Mondlane by sending a parcel to his office in Dar es Salaam. Inside the parcel was a book containing an <b>explosive</b> <b>device,</b> which detonated upon opening. Other sources state that Eduardo was killed when an <b>explosive</b> <b>device</b> detonated underneath his chair at the FRELIMO headquarters, and that the faction responsible was never identified.|$|E
5|$|The parked Renault car was {{subsequently}} {{dealt with by}} a military bomb-disposal team. It has now been established {{that it did not}} contain an <b>explosive</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E

5|$|At 8:00am on 1 August, a Georgian police lorry {{was blown}} {{up by an}} improvised <b>explosive</b> <b>device</b> on the road near Tskhinvali, {{injuring}} five Georgian policemen. In response, Georgian snipers assaulted some of the South Ossetian border checkpoints, killing four Ossetians and injuring seven. According to majority of reports, South Ossetians were responsible for instigating the bomb explosion which marked the opening of hostilities.|$|E
50|$|Explosive weapons may be {{subdivided}} {{by their}} {{method of manufacture}} into explosive ordnance and improvised <b>explosive</b> <b>devices</b> (IEDs). Certain types of explosive ordnance and many improvised <b>explosive</b> <b>devices</b> are sometimes referred to under the generic term bomb.|$|R
50|$|The {{police arrested}} the two women. More than 50 improvised <b>explosive</b> <b>devices</b> were recovered. The police also seized {{large numbers of}} wrist watch dials, SIM cards and tools used to prepare improvised <b>explosive</b> <b>devices.</b> Micro SD cards {{containing}} propaganda songs, Taliban training videos were recovered. Fake Indian documents like elector's card and passport were found. Maps and half burnt books in Arabic too were recovered. The CID detonated the improvised <b>explosive</b> <b>devices</b> {{on the banks of}} Damodar.|$|R

5|$|Corporal Ramona M. Valdez (1984â€“2005) was {{assigned}} to Headquarters Battalion, 2nd Marine Division, II Marine Expeditionary Force. Valdez, whose mother immigrated from the Dominican Republic, was a communications specialist. Valdez's most significant work was with Division's Counter Improvised <b>Explosive</b> <b>Device</b> Working Group. The success of the tests conducted by CIEDWG was in a large part attributed to Valdez's knowledge of single-channel radios.|$|E
5|$|On 24 October 2014, it was {{reported}} that the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant had used chlorine gas in the town of Duluiyah, Iraq. Laboratory analysis of clothing and soil samples confirmed the use of chlorine gas against Kurdish Peshmerga Forces in a vehicle-borne improvised <b>explosive</b> <b>device</b> attack on 23 January 2015 at the Highway 47 Kiske Junction near Mosul.|$|E
5|$|Taliban forces took up new {{positions}} {{to defend the}} town on 9 December. Taliban sources suggested {{at the time that}} militants from nearby areas were entering the town to reinforce its defence. Fighting was on-going through the day and bombs planted by insurgents continued to take a toll on ISAF forces: an American soldier, Corporal Tanner J O'Leary of the 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment, was killed by the detonation of an improvised <b>explosive</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E

Their data showed the number of civilians killed or injured by car and suicide bombs and other improvised <b>explosive</b> <b>devices</b> rising by 70 percent in the three years to 2013.|$|R
5|$|A flame fougasse (sometimes {{contracted}} to fougasse {{and may be}} spelled foo gas) {{is a type of}} mine or improvised <b>explosive</b> <b>device</b> which uses an explosive charge to project burning liquid onto a target. The flame fougasse was developed by the Petroleum Warfare Department in Britain as an anti-tank weapon during the invasion crisis of 1940. During that period, about 50,000 flame fougasse barrels were deployed in some 7,000 batteries, mostly in southern England and a little later at 2,000 sites in Scotland. Although never used in combat in Britain, the design saw action later in Greece.|$|E
5|$|About 20 {{minutes before}} the plane landed, on its final descent, he {{secretly}} ignited a small <b>explosive</b> <b>device</b> consisting of a mix of plastic explosive powder and acid. Abdulmutallab apparently had a packet of the plastic explosive sewn to his underwear, and injected liquid acid from a syringe into the packet to cause a chemical reaction. While {{there was a small}} explosion and fire, the device failed to detonate properly. Passengers heard popping noises resembling firecrackers, smelled an odor, and saw the suspect's pants, leg and the wall of the plane on fire.|$|E
5|$|During its {{deployment}} to Iraq, {{the brigade}} undertook many responsibilities, including providing logistics for airdrops and major combat operations including Operation Marne Torch. The brigade {{also created a}} Combat Logistics Patrol academy, training for combat situations during convoy operations, including improvised <b>explosive</b> <b>device</b> detection and removal, and first aid. The brigade also dispatched optometry teams to soldiers {{in the region to}} ensure they had all the eyesight testing they needed. The brigade returned to the continental United States in early 2008 {{along with the rest of}} the 82d Airborne Division, and was recognized by President George W. Bush in a welcome home speech.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, Oklahoma City was {{the site}} {{of one of the most}} {{destructive}} acts of domestic terrorism in American history. The Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, in which Timothy McVeigh detonated a large, crude <b>explosive</b> <b>device</b> outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killed 168 people, including 19 children. For his crime, McVeigh was executed by the federal government on June 11, 2001. His accomplice, Terry Nichols, is serving life in prison without parole for helping plan the attack and prepare the explosive.|$|E
5|$|Project A119, {{also known}} as A Study of Lunar Research Flights, was a top-secret plan {{developed}} in 1958 by the United States Air Force. The aim {{of the project was}} to detonate a nuclear bomb on the Moon which would help in answering some of the mysteries in planetary astronomy and astrogeology. If the <b>explosive</b> <b>device</b> detonated on the surface, not in a lunar crater, the flash of explosive light would have been faintly visible to people on earth with their naked eye, a show of force resulting in a possible boosting of domestic morale in the capabilities of the United States, a boost that was needed after the Soviet Union took an early lead in the Space Race and was also working on a similar project.|$|E
5|$|This {{one-shot}} {{issue was}} published in March 1993. The story was originally published in graphic-novel form in 1991 as Avengers-Deathtrap: The Vault (1991), but was later reprinted under the Venom label. As a result, the fictional events precede those of Venom: Lethal Protector and are referenced in that series. The issue follows a supervillain prison outbreak at The Vault, led by Brock, that allows the inmates to overrun the prison and take its staff hostage. The Avengers and Freedom Force attempt to defeat the villains in a race against time because the prison's final fail-safe, a powerful <b>explosive</b> <b>device,</b> has been activated by Vault warden Truman Marsh. DCD estimated that the comic was their 13th-bestselling trade paperback of 1993.|$|E

The homemade <b>explosive</b> <b>devices</b> exploded causing minor structural damage and starting a fire which destroyed the interior.|$|R
5|$|Tahna orders Kira {{at gunpoint}} {{to return to}} the station, {{intending}} to collapse the wormhole with an <b>explosive</b> <b>device,</b> because then Bajor will have no motivation to invite Federation presence on Bajoran territory, which he sees as a new occupation. Kira lurches the runabout to one side, causing Tahna to fall over and allowing her to pilot the ship through the wormhole to the Gamma Quadrant; where she ejects the bomb causing it to explode harmlessly in space. However, Tahna has regained control of his weapon and orders Kira {{to return to the}} Alpha Quadrant. There, Sisko gives Tahna an ultimatum, either to give himself over to the station's authorities, or to wait to be destroyed by the Cardassians. Tahna hands over his weapon to Kira, and turns himself in; Kira explains that he may come to understand why this {{was the right thing to}} do someday.|$|E
5|$|The Tudor mansion was {{dismantled}} but, {{concerned that}} the stone would swiftly disintegrate during the demolition phase, Weddell's advisers ordered that a small <b>explosive</b> <b>device</b> be triggered in {{the centre of the}} house and the undamaged stones salvaged. However, the explosion had the effect of splitting the walls intact meaning that much of the building could be salvaged and shipped to the United States. The first shipments arrived in Richmond, Virginia in early 1926, but they were soaked in seawater and had to be dried in a barn for up to six months. From the very beginning, the Weddells planned on deeding the house to the Virginia Historical Society and allocating the west wing of the structure as a museum once it was rebuilt in Virginia. The Weddells also intended the structure to become the society's new headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Donna {{is shocked}} when her estranged father Derek (Clarke Peters) is {{admitted}} to the hospital and diagnosed with cancer. He dies soon thereafter, and when dealing with his effects, Donna learns that he unknowingly fathered another daughter. Though her half-sister is recently deceased, Donna meets her half-niece Mia (Jada Wallace-Mitchell), who is being raised by her grandmother, Patti (Barbara Drennan). Within weeks, Patti also dies, and Donna decides to adopt Mia. She and her friend Maria (Phoebe Thomas) compete for a ward sister position on the general surgery ward. Although Maria is the successful applicant, she realises that Donna needs the job in order to support Mia, and withdraws her candidacy so Donna is appointed sister. Donna falls in love with agency nurse Kieran Callaghan (Barry Sloane), and is devastated when he is called to serve in Afghanistan with the Territorial Army (TA). Kieran asks her to marry him, but Donna refuses, terminating their relationship with the intention of giving Mia stability. When Kieran is injured by an improvised <b>explosive</b> <b>device</b> (IED), Donna reconsiders, supporting him through the amputation of his leg. Upon learning that he will be transferred to a rehabilitation unit in Liverpool, Donna resigns in order to move there with him.|$|E
