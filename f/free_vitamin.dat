50|$|The same {{cells in}} the stomach that produce gastric {{hydrochloric}} acid, the parietal cells, also produce a molecule called the intrinsic factor (IF), which binds the B12 after its release from haptocorrin by digestion, and without which only 1% of vitamin B12 is absorbed. Intrinsic factor (IF) is a glycoprotein, with a molecular weight of 45 kDa. In the duodenum, the <b>free</b> <b>vitamin</b> B12 attaches to the intrinsic factor (IF) to create a vitamin B12-IF complex. This complex then travels through the small bowel and reaches the terminal tertiary portion of the small intestine, called the ileum. The ileum is the longest of all portions of the small intestine, and has on its surface specialized receptors called cubilin receptors, that identify the B12-IF complexes and take them up into the circulation via endocytosis mediated absorption.|$|E

Once in the more neutral duodenum, pancreatic enzymes break down the protective glycoprotein. The <b>freed</b> <b>vitamin</b> B12 then binds to intrinsic factor which is then absorbed by the enterocytes in the ileum.|$|R

40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{analysis of}} fat- and water-soluble vitamins from foods {{is a difficult}} task considering {{the wide range of}} chemical structures involved. In this work, a new procedure based on a sequential extraction and analysis of both types of vitamins is presented. The procedure couples several simple extraction steps to LC–MS/MS and LC–DAD in order to quantify the <b>free</b> <b>vitamins</b> contents in fresh-cut vegetables before and after a 10 -days storage period. The developed method allows the correct quantification of vitamins C, B 1, B 2, B 3, B 5, B 6, B 9, E and provitamin A in ready-to-eat green leafy vegetable products including green lettuce, ruby red lettuce, watercress, swiss chard, lamb's lettuce, spearmint, spinach, wild rocket, pea leaves, mizuna, garden cress and red mustard. Using this optimized methodology, low LOQs were attained for the analyzed vitamins in less than 100 min, including extraction and vitamin analysis using 2 optimized procedures; good repeatability and linearity was achieved for all vitamins studied, while recoveries ranged from 83 % to 105 %. The most abundant <b>free</b> <b>vitamins</b> found in leafy vegetable products were vitamin C, provitamin A and vitamin E. The richest sample on vitamin C and provitamin A was pea leaves (154 mg/g fresh weight and 14. 4 mg/ 100 g fresh weight, respectively), whereas lamb's lettuce was the vegetable with the highest content on vitamin E (3. 1 mg/ 100 g fresh weight). Generally, some losses of vitamins were detected after storage, although the behavior of each vitamin varied strongly among samples.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{association}} between serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D [25 (OH) D] and chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases is controversial. Recently, racial differences in bone mineral density between {{white and black}} Americans were explained by the levels of bioavailable vitamin D, which suggested {{that it might be}} a better marker of vitamin D status than 25 (OH) D. We aimed to investigate if bioavailable vitamin D was a better vitamin D marker than 25 (OH) D in the Hong Kong Chinese population. METHODS: Serum 25 (OH) D and vitamin D binding protein (DBP) levels were measured in 2674 participants (592 men, 2082 women; mean [± standard deviation] age, 49. 2 ± 16. 2 years) in the Hong Kong Osteoporosis Study. The levels of free and bioavailable vitamin D were calculated using the equation developed by Vermeulen et al. Their associations with serum calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations were evaluated using ANCOVA with adjustment for age and sex. RESULTS: The mean levels of 25 (OH) D and DBP were 50. 3 nmol/L ± 13. 7 nmol/L and 178. 8 µg/mL ± 74. 0 µg/mL, respectively, and calculated free and bioavailable vitamin D levels were 8. 79 pg/mL ± 4. 23 pg/mL and 3. 50 ng/mL ± 1. 67 ng/mL, respectively. Serum 25 (OH) D level was significantly associated with serum calcium, phosphorus, and PTH levels (P < 0. 05). In contrast, bioavailable vitamin D levels were only associated with serum calcium, while <b>free</b> <b>vitamin</b> D levels were only associated with serum phosphorus. CONCLUSION: Bioavailable vitamin D and <b>free</b> <b>vitamin</b> D correlate less well with mineral metabolism markers than 25 (OH) D in the Hong Kong Chinese population.

Gambians had significantly higher plasma concentrations of vitamin D metabolites and lower albumin concentration compared to the British and Chinese. Significant DRs were observed for all analytes and calculated <b>free</b> <b>vitamin</b> D metabolites (P < 0. 01). The pattern of DRs was similar between countries. The magnitude of the DRs of free 1, 25 (OH) 2 D was attenuated {{compared to that of}} total 1, 25 (OH) 2 D whereas it was not different between total and free 25 (OH) D. Relationships between the DRs were generally weak. There was no phase shift between 1, 25 (OH) 2 D and DBP with the strongest cross correlation at 0 h time lag (r = 0. 15, P = < 0. 001). In comparison, 25 (OH) D correlated less well with DBP (1 h time lag, r = 0. 07, P = 0. 12).

40|$|Seasonal {{changes in}} the Persian orange (Citrus sinensis var. Sia-Varaz) {{and the effect of}} canning and storage on the juice were studied. The major factors under {{consideration}} were the physical characteristics: weight, size, volume of juice, colour of peel; and chemical characteristics: <b>free</b> sugars, <b>vitamin</b> C, <b>free</b> amino acids and lipid content. In order to determine the optimum state of maturity of the orange, samples were harvested at regular monthly intervals and analysed. 1. Throughout fruit development there was a continuous increase of juice, fruit size, and total soluble solids while total acidity decreased. These parameters were sufficiently different to enable the separation of the development cycle into three distinct phases: Cell division, Cell enlargement and Maturation of the fruit. Colour break from yellow to orange occurred between December and January but the oranges were assessed to be mature for harvesting by February and March. 2. Five sugars were identified: xylose, galactose, fructose, glucose and sucrose. Xylose soon disappeared while galactose was only found in minor quantities. Sucrose and reducing sugar content increased with fruit development. In the mature orange the ratio of suerose : glueose : fructose was very close to 2 : 1 : 1. 3. While vitamin C content per 100 g pulp showed no significant change over the period of study the amount per orange pulp increased approximately four-fold. 4. Seventeen amino acids were identified. Increase in proline and arginine during December and January may be used as an indication of the onset of maturation. 5. Changes in lipid constituents were noted but, in general, no definite pattern could be established. The processing procedure involved heating the juice at 98 °C for 30 seconds and then sealing in lacquered A 1 cans. Analyses were carried out at two-monthly intervals. 6.

Although these cells contain a membrane folate-binding protein (FBP) involved in the uptake of free folate, no studies have been conducted to evaluate whether the folate-protein conjugates enter cells via the same protein. To address this issue, HeLa cell monolayers were treated with folate-labelled 125 I-RNAase under various conditions characteristic of FBP-mediated folate uptake. Folate-labelled 125 I-RNAase was found to bind to cells with high affinity (Kd = 24 nM), and like the <b>free</b> <b>vitamin,</b> its binding could be competitively blocked by excess free folate. Furthermore, binding could be reversed by either washing the cells with acid/saline, pH 3. 0, or by treating the cells with phosphatidyl-inositol-specific phospholipase C, an enzyme known to release FBP from cell surfaces. Because cells pretreated with anti-FBP serum were unable to bind folate conjugates, and since the same antiserum identified a single 65 kDa band reminiscent of FBPs found in many other tissues, we conclude that a classical FBP is responsible for the uptake of folate-protein conjugates by receptor-bearing cells...|$|E

Methods used to test the ability of serum to bind added vitamin 1112 mi vitro and to eStah) hiSh the location of the vitamin in electrophoretic fractions of serum have already been described. ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Triplicate {{groups of}} rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) fed six diets; five based on fish protein {{concentrate}} (FPC) ranging in caloric density from 4. 36 to 6. 19 kcal/g, and {{one based on}} <b>vitamin</b> <b>free</b> casein with a caloric density of 5. 26 kcal/g were evaluated with respect to diet ingredient utilization. The parameters used to evaluate efficiency of diet utilization were: feed conversion, energy and protein conversion, and growth. The desirability of the edible portion of the fish produced on the different treatments from a flavor and texture standpoint was determined. The protein level was maintained at 38...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Ethanol {{liver disease}} is a major health problem worldwide. One aspect of ethanol {{toxicity}} that has received increasing attention {{in recent years is}} the role of free radical species in the etiology of liver injury. Vitamins C and E are antioxidants that scavenge for free radicals. The effect of 200 mg Vitamin C + 200 mg Vitamin E as food supplement administered for 7 days was studied on hepatic damage induced by ethanol (40 % v/v, 2. 0 ml/ 100 g body weight per oral for 21 days) in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The supplements were administered for the last week of 21 days administration of ethanol. Serum transaminases, Lipid peroxidase and Bilirubin were estimated to access liver damage. Our results showed that ethanol induce increased serum Transaminases, Lipid peroxidase and Bilirubin levels. The biochemical findings were supplemented by histopathological examination of the liver sections. The study confirmed the hepatoprotective effects of Vitamins C and E on the hepatocytes of rats as demonstrated by previous investigators.

40|$|Vitamin E {{is known}} as {{important}} antioxidant to protect the reproductive system. The free radicals are continuously produced in last few years due to metabolic and nutritional deficiencies. These free radicals {{are responsible for the}} production of oxidative stress in animal bodies. This production of extensive amount of oxidative stress caused the detrimental effects on the sperm and various other male parameters. This imbalance between the antioxidants and oxidative stress, leads to the condition of infertility in male. Antioxidants play an important role for eliminating of these <b>free</b> radicals. <b>Vitamin</b> E {{is one of the best}} antioxidants for the removal of oxidative stress in male reproductive system. Its use increases the reproductive functions and efficiency of male reproductive system. The deficiency of this vitamin leads to degeneration of germinal epithelium and Leydig cells in seminiferous tubules. The use of selenium and vitamin E has the synergistic effects on the male reproductive system. The objective of this review was to collect the beneficial roles of this vitamin along selenium on reproductive system of birds and different animals. This review will also collect the different doses along the beneficial roles on different parameters of male reproductive system...|$|R
