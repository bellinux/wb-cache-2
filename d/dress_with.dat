The dress was asymmetrical, with a cowled–neck. Fernandez specifically chose cuts to ensure that the dress kept well. Flank steak was chosen as the material to use, with the meat coming from his family butcher. The dress required Gaga to be stitched into the outfit backstage.|$|E

40|$|This {{work was}} carried out to study the effect of topical {{application}} of Andrographis paniculata on the rate of wound enclosure and its histological features. A wound was created in four groups of rat in posterior neck region. Blank placebo was applied topically to the wounds of Group 1. Groups 2 and 3 were <b>dressed</b> <b>with</b> placebo containing 5 % and 10 % extracts of A. paniculata, respectively. Intrasite gel was applied topically to the wounds of Group 4. Macroscopical examination revealed {{that the rate of}} wound healing was significantly accelerated in the wound <b>dressed</b> <b>with</b> A. paniculata extract compared to the blank placebo. The wounds <b>dressed</b> <b>with</b> 10 % extract or Intrasite gel healed earlier compared to the wounds <b>dressed</b> <b>with</b> placebo containing 5 % A. paniculata extract. Histologically, wounds <b>dressed</b> <b>with</b> A. paniculata extracts showed markedly less scar width and contained large amounts of fibroblast proliferation. More collagen and less angiogenesis with absence of inflammatory cells were seen for wounds <b>dressed</b> <b>with</b> 10 % A. paniculata compared to the blank placebo. Conclusion, A. paniculata extracts significantly enhanced rate of wound healing in rats. © 2012 Taylor & Francis...|$|R

Knight sent the painting to an international exhibition held at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh and it was purchased by the National Gallery of Canada for £400. Knight started the vast painting Lamorna Birch and his Daughters in 1913, painting in a wood in the Lamorna Valley but then kept the painting unfinished in her studio until finally completing it in 1934, the same year Birch was elected a full member of the Royal Academy.|$|E
5|$|At the prom, Artie and Marge are voted prom {{king and}} queen, {{and the two}} share the first dance. Meanwhile, Homer, heartbroken, leaves and cries in the hallway. After the prom, Artie tries to get romantic with Marge in the {{backseat}} of his car: after he pushes his luck too far, she slaps him and demands to be taken home. Meanwhile, Homer's limousine time has run out, and without any money, he decides to walk home. Along the way Marge and Artie pass by Homer. After Artie drops Marge off at her house, she returns in her car to pick up Homer, realizing that he was the man for her all along. Homer manages to fix up the strap of Marge's <b>dress</b> <b>with</b> the corsage that he got her after Artie ruined it from his earlier attempt.|$|E
5|$|Celebrities, artists, {{and merchants}} enjoyed fine food, opium, and liquor at the Great Southern Hotel, which had novel Western pleasures, {{such as a}} disco ball {{specially}} imported from the USA. The allure of Western goods and traditions even extended to weddings held at the hotel. A prolific Chinese writer, Wu Sijing, held her 17-table wedding banquet there in 1952, and was photographed in a white bridal <b>dress,</b> <b>with</b> her husband in a white suit and bowtie. This choice of dress would have been most unusual amongst mainland Chinese due to the nationalistic influence of Mao-era China, highlighting Singapore's confluence between Eastern and Western cultures, of which the hotel was at the forefront. Both in decor, and activities.|$|E

5|$|Gaga did not preview {{the costumes}} {{for the tour}} until the opening night. There were seven outfits created for the show, all {{throughout}} the different segments. The first was a bejeweled leotard which had the Jeff Koons blue gazing ball attached in the middle; the ball was previously used in the album cover art for Artpop. Gaga accessorized the <b>dress</b> <b>with</b> a pair of feathered wings while wearing a blond bob wig reminiscent of her looks from The Fame era. A rave inspired outfit was worn for the last segment and consisted of colorful dreadlocks and legwarmers made of fur. She added a shirt consisting of straps and plastic sleeves with it. One of the complex outfits was made of latex and consisted of a polka dotted leotard {{and a number of}} tentacles attached to the dress as well as a headpiece with two tentacles from it.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, Saigon {{designers}} {{tightened the}} fit of the ao dai to create the version commonly seen today. Trần Kim of Thiết Lập Tailors and Dũng of Dũng Tailors created a <b>dress</b> <b>with</b> raglan sleeves and a diagonal seam that runs from the collar to the underarm. Madame Nhu, first lady of South Vietnam, popularized a collarless version beginning in 1958. The ao dai was most popular from 1960 to 1975. A brightly colored áo dài hippy was introduced in 1968. The áo dài mini, a version designed for practical use and convenience, had slits that extended above the waist and panels that reached only to the knee.|$|E
5|$|Ivy's {{alternate}} character {{designs in}} the games are a contrast to her primary designs, with the secondary from Soulcalibur to Soulcalibur III consisting of countess attire of either blue or red pants, vest, and jacket, with white boots covering her feet and her hair combed back. In Soulcalibur II, a tertiary alternate design was added consisting of a red leotard and gloves with gold trimming, with red stockings on her legs; in addition, a fourth design resembling her appearance {{at the conclusion of}} Soulcalibur was considered, incorporating a cloak and the symbol of caduceus on the front of her leotard cupping her breasts, but was unused. In Soulcalibur III, a long, rose-themed <b>dress</b> <b>with</b> hat and veil was used as a tertiary alternate, one of several considered designs. For Soulcalibur IV, a similarly themed black dress was used as her sole alternate design for the game.|$|E

40|$|The ethanolic extract of Lantana camara leaf was {{evaluated}} for their wound healing potential in rats. Four grouhs of adult male Wistar albino rats were experimentally {{wound in the}} posterior neck area. A thin layer of blank placebo Was applied topically to wounds of Group 1. Wound of Group 2 and 3 animals were <b>dressed</b> <b>with</b> {{a thin layer of}} placebo containing 5 and 10 % L. canzara extract, respectively. A thin layer of intrasite gel was applied topically to wounds of Group 4 animals as reference. The effects of these topical applicants on the rate of wound healing mid histology were assessed. Wound <b>dressed</b> <b>with</b> placebo containing plant extracts significantly healed earlier than those treated with blank placebo. Wounds <b>dressed</b> <b>with</b> placebo containing 10 % extract significantly accelerate wound healing activity compared to wounds <b>dressed</b> <b>with</b> placebo containing 5 % extract. Histological analyses of healed wounds confirmed the results. Wounds <b>dressed</b> <b>with</b> placebo containing extracts showed markedly less sear width at the wound enclosure and wounds contained large amounts of fibroblast proliferation and more mature and densely packed collagen with accompanying angiogenesis compared to wounds <b>dressed</b> only <b>with</b> blank placebo. We conclude that L. camara extract significantly enhanced the acceleration rate of wound enclosure in rats. © Medwell Journals, 2009...|$|R
5|$|Stephen Stickler {{acted as}} the band's photographer, and Jay Papke and Dante Ariola {{directed}} the album's cover art and booklet. The cover depicts {{a little girl}} in a purple <b>dress</b> <b>with</b> a matching bow in her blonde hair, bringing her swing to a stop to squint in the sun at the man standing before her.

The band's logo, a childlike drawing of the band's name created by lead singer Jonathan Davis, is seen on the sandy ground by Dark Shadow; the way it's positioned next to the girls' shadow makes it appear the latter is being hanged.|$|E
5|$|The video's {{first scene}} {{is set in}} a desert at night. Rihanna, wearing a {{garrison}} cap, sunglasses, and a stylized white top, stands in front of an army. This scene is intercut with scenes of Rihanna in a bunker; she wears an army hard hat, pink lace up boots, and a skin-colored top with small black rectangles covering her breasts. Halfway through the first verse, the scene changes to a daytime desert scene in which Rihanna wears a low cut, short black <b>dress</b> <b>with</b> spiked shoulder pads, and walks through the location as small explosions occur around her.|$|E
5|$|The woman {{wears an}} elegant low-cut black <b>dress</b> <b>with</b> dark bands of fur {{at the neck}} and wrist. Her clothes are of the then-fashionable Burgundian style, which emphasises the tall and thin {{aesthetic}} of the Gothic ideal. Her dress is buckled by a bright red sash pulled in below her breasts. The buff-coloured hennin headdress is draped with a large transparent veil, which spills over her shoulders, reaching her upper arms. Van der Weyden's attention {{to the structure of}} the clothing—the careful detailing of the pins pushed into the veil to fix its position—is typical for the artist.|$|E

5|$|Until 1908, revivals of {{the opera}} were given in {{contemporary}} <b>dress,</b> <b>with</b> ladies' costumes executed by couture houses such as Redfern. After that, designers such as Percy Anderson, George Sheringham and Peter Goffin created Victorian costume designs. The 1887 set was designed by Hawes Craven. In the winter of 1940–41, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's scenery and costumes for Pinafore and three other operas were destroyed by German bombs during World War II. The opera was revived in London {{in the summer of}} 1947. It was then included in the D'Oyly Carte repertory in every season from then on, until the company's closure in 1982. The D'Oyly Carte company performed Pinafore before Queen Elizabeth II and the royal family at Windsor Castle on 16 June 1977, during the queen's Silver Jubilee year, the first royal command performance of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera since 1891.|$|E
5|$|The Pharisee Nicodemus {{supports}} Christ {{as he is}} lowered, and can {{be identified}} by his similarity to Simon the Pharisee in another canvas attributed to Bouts, Christ in the House of Simon. The Virgin wears a white headdress and a dark blue <b>dress</b> <b>with</b> a yellowish mantle, and holds Christ's arm just above his wrist as if afraid {{to let go of}} her dead son. She is supported by John the Evangelist, who wears a red robe. Dressed in green robes, Mary Salome stands to the Virgin's left, wiping tears from her face with the fold of her white headdress. Mary of Clopas is behind them, holding a red cloth over her mouth, while the Magdalen is in the foreground at Christ's feet, dressed in a heavily folded cloak. The man in the brown–green tabard at the feet of Christ is probably Joseph of Arimathea, who, according to Gospel, brought Christ's body to Golgotha from Pontius Pilate.|$|E
5|$|The {{engagement}} {{was declared}} on 5 December 1865, {{and despite the}} Prince of Wales's initial refusal to attend, Princess Alice intervened, and the wedding was a happy occasion. The Queen allowed the ceremony to take place at Windsor Castle, albeit in the Private Chapel rather than the grander St George's Chapel on 5 July 1866. The Queen relieved her black mourning <b>dress</b> <b>with</b> a white mourning cap which draped over her back. The main participants filed into the chapel {{to the sound of}} Beethoven's , creating a spectacle only marred by the sudden disappearance of Prince George, the Duke of Cambridge, who had a sudden gout attack. Christian filed into the chapel with his two supporters, Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar and Prince Frederic of Schleswig-Holstein, and Helena was given away by her mother, who escorted her up the aisle with the Prince of Wales and eight bridesmaids. Christian looked older than he was, and one guest commented that Helena looked as if she was marrying an aged uncle. Indeed, when he was first summoned to Britain, he assumed that the widowed Queen was inspecting him as a new husband for herself rather than as a candidate for one of her daughters. The couple spent the first night of their married life at Osborne House, before honeymooning in Paris, Interlaken and Genoa.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift {{entering}} the coffee shop. As she sits down, she notices that couple, opposite {{where she is}} sitting, is arguing, reminding Swift about her parents arguing when she was very young. Then the waiter (Toby Hemingway) comes by, just to take Swift's order, who looks up and she infatuates him, resulting in a romantic relationship between the two. They are seen moving in together and unpacking boxes. After some time of dating, he proposes to her on a rowboat and she cheerfully accepts. Later, the two are seen arguing, resulting in Swift running away from the house, crying, just like she did {{when she was younger}} as she saw her parents arguing. The boyfriend follows her, and the two reconcile the relationship. They get married and have two sons. In the end, time returns to when Swift was ordering her food at the coffee shop. Throughout the video, there are some scenes of Swift singing the verses of the song while walking barefoot on a green pasture amongst photos of her and her family. The photos are hanging on a white string in between two large trees. Swift is seen with her hair loose and wearing a white <b>dress</b> <b>with</b> a thin belt around the waist.|$|E
5|$|When {{the pilgrims}} reach the {{appropriate}} Miqat (depending on where they're coming from), they {{enter into a}} state of holiness – known as Ihram – that consists of wearing two white seamless cloths for the male, with the one wrapped around the waist reaching below the knee and the other draped over the left shoulder and tied at the right side; wearing ordinary dress for the female that fulfills the Islamic condition of public <b>dress</b> <b>with</b> hands or face uncovered; taking ablution; declaring the intention (niyah) to perform pilgrimage and to refraining from certain activities such as clipping the nails, shaving any part of the body, having sexual relations; using perfumes, damaging plants, killing animals, covering head (for men) or the face and hands (for women); getting married; or carrying weapons. The ihram is meant to show equality of all pilgrims in front of God: there is no difference between the rich and the poor.|$|E
5|$|A {{pastiche}} {{of following}} scenes alternates between Spears {{dancing on the}} soundstage, singing with the microphones and a scene of just red lips, {{a reference to the}} opening shot of the 1975 film The Rocky Horror Picture Show. This begins to show her losing grip, reminiscent of her break down. When the breakdown starts, she begins to eject painting through IVs in her fingers, staining the room and the monitors, symbolizing her own fall as her name becomes tainted. Then, two versions of Spears, both wearing blue and red dresses with flowing trains, are seen fighting each other, another symbolism, this time of her fighting her inner demons. After this, both versions of Spears, as well as her on the wedding dress, fall exhausted to the ground, symbolizing the lowest point of her life during the breakdown. While interspersed scenes of Spears in the soundstage are shown, the other versions of herself start to wake up, showing her getting her feet back on the ground and making a comeback, refusing to give up. The final scene shows Spears dressed in a short black <b>dress</b> <b>with</b> her dancers in black on a stage, with confetti and pyrotechnics around them. In the final shot a question mark (?) appears in multicolored letters. This final scene shows her as she once was, a superstar who is back to reclaim her title. The video ends with the same multicolored lettering of a question mark, symbolizing the unknown that is to come.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} topical {{application}} of Benzyl N'-(indol- 3 -Ylmethylidene) -Hydrazinecarbodithioate derivatives (BHC) {{on the process}} of wound healing enclosure and histology of healed wound were assessed. Five groups of adult male Sprague Dawley rats, all animals were experimentally wound in the posterior neck area About 0. 2 rnL of 10 % Tween 20 solution was applied to the wound of Group 1 animals (negative control). Intrasitegel was applied topically to wounds of Group 2 animals as reference. About 0. 2 mL of 25, 50 and 100 mg mL - 1 of compound derivative were applied to the wounds of Group 3, 4 and 5, respectively. Macroscopically, wound <b>dressed</b> <b>with</b> compound derivative significantly healed earlier than those treated with 10 % Tween 20 solution. Also wound <b>dressed</b> <b>with</b> 100 mg mL - 1 compound derivative accelerate the rate of wound healing compared to those <b>dressed</b> <b>with</b> Intrasite and 25 and 50 mg mL - 1 compound derivative. Histological analysis of healed wounds <b>dresses</b> <b>with</b> compound derivative showed comparatively less scar width at wound enclosure and healed wound contained less macrophages and large amount of collagen with angiogenesis compared to wounds <b>dressed</b> <b>with</b> 10 % Tween 20 solution.
