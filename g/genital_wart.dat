Later, Cleveland visits Brian to clear any negative feeling he has against him and Carolyn, as they are at [...] "a point of great soreness", but then Cleveland announces to Brian plans to elope with Carolyn in Hawaii, which makes their friendship tense. Just as Cleveland leaves, Loretta appears out of nowhere. Loretta apologizes to Cleveland for her affair with Quagmire, she then announces that she wants to get their family back together and promises she'll never betray him again. Cleveland goes to Peter and Lois for advice on what should be done. Peter and Lois think Cleveland shouldn't go back to Loretta, but Brian (seeing this as his only chance at getting back with Carolyn) says Cleveland should [...] "forgive and forget", and points out Loretta's good qualities (which he's obviously lying, as his nose starts to grow). Cleveland decides to talk to Loretta tomorrow to see how he feels about getting back together with her. Thinking Loretta hasn't changed, Peter recruits Quagmire to have sex with Loretta again so Cleveland can see she hasn't changed.

40|$|Abstract Background Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) is {{a necessary}} cause of cervical cancer. HPV is also responsible for benign condylomata acuminata, also known as <b>genital</b> <b>warts.</b> We assessed the incidence of <b>genital</b> <b>warts</b> in Germany and collected information on their management to estimate the annual cost of disease. Methods This was a multi-centre observational (cross-sectional) study of <b>genital</b> <b>warts</b> in Germany. Data were collected from gynecologists, dermatologists, and urologists seeing patients with <b>genital</b> <b>warts</b> between February and April 2005. The number of patients with new and recurrent <b>genital</b> <b>warts</b> was used to estimate the incidence in Germany. We assessed resource use for patients with <b>genital</b> <b>warts</b> seen during a two-month period as well as retrospective resource use twelve {{months prior to the}} inclusion visit through a chart review. The mean costs of treatment of patients with <b>genital</b> <b>warts</b> from third-party payer and societal perspectives were estimated, and the total annual cost of <b>genital</b> <b>warts</b> was then calculated. Results For the incidence calculation 217 specialists provided information on 848 patients and 214 specialists provided resource use data for 617 patients to assess resource consumption. The incidence of new and recurrent cases of <b>genital</b> <b>warts</b> was 113. 7 and 34. 7 per 100 000, respectively, for women aged 14 – 65 years consulting gynecologists. The highest incidence was observed in women aged 14 – 25 years (171. 0 per 100 000) for new cases and in women aged 26 – 45 years (53. 1 per 100 000) for recurrent cases. The sample size for males was too small to allow a meaningful estimate of the incidence. The mean direct cost per patient with new <b>genital</b> <b>warts</b> was estimated at 378 euros (95 % CI: 310. 8 – 444. 9); for recurrent <b>genital</b> <b>warts</b> at 603 euros (95 % CI: 436. 5 – 814. 5), and for resistant <b>genital</b> <b>warts</b> at 1, 142 euros (95 % CI: 639. 6 – 1752. 3). The overall cost to third-party payers was estimated at 49. 0 million euros, and the total societal cost at 54. 1 million euros, corresponding to an average cost per patient of 550 euros and 607 euros, respectively. Conclusion The societal burden and costs of managing and treating <b>genital</b> <b>warts</b> in Germany are considerable. A vaccination programme using the quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine could provide a substantial health benefit and reduce the costs associated with <b>genital</b> <b>warts</b> in Germany. </p...|$|R

This study aims to analyze the cases of STI – Associated Syndromes assisted in primary health care center in a city in Northeast Brazil associating them with socio-demographic and behavioral variables. Methods This is a retrospective study that analyzed 5148 consultation forms and medical records of patients assisted in a primary health care center who presented at least one genital syndrome from 1999 to 2008. Was considered as dependent variables the genital syndromes and serologies for syphilis and HIV and as independent variables the socio-demographic and behavioral aspects. It was used Pearson’s chi-square test to analyze the differences between the categorical variables, with a significance level of 5 %. It was performed a multivariate analysis through the multivariate logistic regression model with the variables with p Results The most frequent syndromes were vaginal discharge and/or cervicitis (44 %) and <b>genital</b> <b>wart</b> (42. 2 %). Most people were between 20 and 39 years old (70 %) and women (74. 2 %). Genital ulcer was most prevalent among men (OR[*]=[*] 2. 67; CI 95 % 1. 99 - 3. 58) and people who studied more than eight years (OR[*]=[*] 1. 33; CI 95 % 1. 00 - 1. 75) and wart prevailed among men (OR[*]=[*] 3. 92; IC 95 % 3. 36 - 4. 57), people under 29 years old (OR[*]=[*] 1. 81; CI 95 % 1. 59 - 2. 07) and who studied more than eight years (OR[*]=[*] 1. 75; CI 95 % 1. 54 - 1. 99). The Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) was positive in 7. 3 % of men and in 7. 1 % of women and the Anti-HIV in 3. 1 % of men and 0. 7 % of women.

We detected HPV DNA in male <b>genital</b> <b>warts</b> and evaluated HPV type distribution, especially high-risk HPV types, by use of PCR. The associations between HPV prevalence and various character-istics, such as age, circumcision status, type of <b>genital</b> <b>warts</b> diagnosis (new vs. re-current), number of lesions, site of lesions, and gross morphology, were assessed by use of unconditional multiple logistic regression. Results: High-risk HPV types were detected in 31 cases (23. 5 %), and of these, 27 cases (20. 5 %) contained both high-risk and low-risk HPV types. The most frequently detected high-risk HPV types were HPV 16 (6. 8 %), HPV 33 (4. 5 %), HPV 18 (2. 3 %), and HPV 68 (2. 3 %). In particular, the prevalence of infection with HPV 16 and/or HPV 18 was 8. 3 % (11 of 132). In the multivariate analysis, lesions located at sites including the base of the penis or the pubic area, papular or mixed <b>genital</b> <b>warts,</b> and lack of circumcision significantly increased the association with high-risk HPV infection in male <b>genital</b> <b>warts.</b> Conclusions: The prevalence of high-risk HPV infection was substantial in male <b>genital</b> <b>warts.</b> The site and morphology of lesions and circumcision status were significantly associated with the prevalence of high-risk HPV infection...|$|R

To help discover which (if any) of the recognised STDs might actually cause these conditions, a key question is whether one particular such association is much stronger than the others. The present study is therefore only of women newly attending an STD clinic, and compares the prevalences of cytological abnormalities of the cervix among 415 women attending with genital warts, 135 with genital herpes, and 458 with trichomoniasis or gonorrhoea. Significantly more <b>genital</b> <b>wart</b> patients (8. 1 %) than trichomoniasis or gonorrhoea patients (1. 9 %) showed dyskaryotic changes (adjusted relative risk (RR) = 5. 8 with 95 % limits 2. 5 - 13. 5) at, or a few months before, first attendance, while no excess whatever was seen in women with genital herpes. Moreover, half the women had a subsequent smear (at an average of 3 - 4 years after first attendance) and, although the diagnosis at first attendance was not related to the onset rate of dyskaryotic changes observed in these subsequent smears, it was related to the onset rate of grade III cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN III), which was found in 7 previous <b>genital</b> <b>wart</b> patients, in 2 previous trichomonas patients, but in 0 previous genital herpes patients.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Genital</b> <b>warts,</b> {{which are}} caused by {{infection}} with human papillomavirus (HPV), {{are one of the}} most common sexually transmitted diseases in Europe. Although <b>genital</b> <b>warts</b> are commonly perceived as a non-serious condition, treatment is often long, of varying effectiveness and the recurrence rate is high. Very few studies have been performed on the personal consequences of <b>genital</b> <b>warts.</b> The aim of this qualitative study, set in Denmark, was to examine the ways in which <b>genital</b> <b>warts</b> may affect patients' quality of life. Methods To obtain an in-depth understanding of patients' perceptions of <b>genital</b> <b>warts,</b> we used qualitative focus-group interviews with five men and five women aged between 18 and 30 years who had <b>genital</b> <b>warts.</b> The interview guide was based on a literature review that identified important issues and questions. The data were analysed using a medical anthropological approach. Results Patients' experiences were related to cultural conceptions of venereal diseases and the respective identities and sexuality of the sexes. The disease had negative psychological and social effects both for men and for women and it affected their sex and love lives, in particular. The psychological burden of the disease was increased by the uncertain timeline and the varying effectiveness of treatment. We identified a need for more patient information about the disease and its psycho-sexual aspects. Conclusions The men and women participating in this study considered their quality of life to be significantly lowered because of <b>genital</b> <b>warts.</b> The experiences described by the participants give insights that may be valuable in treatment and counselling. The quadrivalent HPV vaccine that has now been added to the childhood vaccination programme for girls in Denmark for the prevention of cervical cancer can also prevent 90 % of cases of <b>genital</b> <b>warts.</b> Our results suggest that HPV vaccination could considerably reduce the largely unacknowledged psychological and social burden associated with <b>genital</b> <b>warts,</b> in men as well as women. </p...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} cross-sectional {{study was to determine}} the prevalence and incidence rate of <b>genital</b> <b>warts</b> using questionnaire survey in the Czech population and to assess the risk predictors of <b>genital</b> <b>warts.</b> Between January 2013 and March 2014 valid data were collected from 33, 700 attendees at 268 outpatient clinics in all 14 regions of the Czech Republic. The questionnaire enquired on several lifestyle factors, including residence, education, smoking, number of lifetime sexual partners, and HPV immunization status, as well as date of birth and gender. Information on <b>genital</b> <b>warts</b> was obtained with the question, ''Have you ever had genital warts?''. Study participants were also asked for the year of their first outbreak of <b>genital</b> <b>warts</b> and of recurrent episodes if any occurred, the treatments received, and the <b>genital</b> <b>warts</b> status of their sexual partner. The questionnaire [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Summary Cervical {{carcinoma}} and cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) {{are likely}} to be associated with all sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). To help discover which (if any) of the recognised STDs might actually cause these conditions, a key question is whether one particular such association is much stronger than the others. The present study is therefore only of women newly attending an STD clinic, and compares the prevalences of cytological abnormalities of the cervix among 415 women attending with genital warts, 135 with genital herpes, and 458 with trichomoniasis or gonorrhoea. Significantly more <b>genital</b> <b>wart</b> patients(8. 1 %) than trichomoniasis or gonorrhoea patients (1. 9 %) showed dyskaryotic changes (adjusted relative risk(RR) = 5. 8 with 95 % limits 2. 5 - 13. 5) at, or a few months before, first attendance, while no excess whatever was seen in women with genital herpes. Moreover, half the women had a subsequent smear (at an average of 3 - 4 years after first attendance) and, although the diagnosis at first attendance was not related to the onset rate of dyskaryotic changes observed in these subsequent smears, it was related to the onset rate of grade III cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN III), which was found in 7 previous <b>genital</b> <b>wart</b> patients, in 2 previous trichomonas patients, but in 0 previous genital herpes patients. Thus, our findings suggest that herpes is notdirectly relevant to dyskaryotic change, but that {{one or more of the}} human papilloma viruses that cause genital warts may be. Although it has long been suspected that cervical cancer is of venereal origin (Kessler, 1976), it has proved remarkably difficult to determine whethe...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Only {{a portion}} of the US {{population}} is willing to consider HPV vaccination to date. The primary aim {{of this study is to}} determine the decisional satisfaction associated with HPV vaccination. Study Design: This is a prospective survey conducted at an urban college where women 18 – 26 years old completed a decisional satisfaction survey about their HPV vaccine experience. Results: Regardless of the decision to accept or reject HPV vaccination, the decisional satisfaction was very high (mean 5 -item score = 21. 2 (SD 3. 8)). Women without HPV vaccination were decisionally neutral significantly more often than those already vaccinated; 22 % were decisionally neutral for the option to accept HPV vaccination at that visit. Cervical cancer prevention was preferred significantly more often than <b>genital</b> <b>wart</b> prevention in all analyses. Conclusions: Targeting those who are decisionally neutral about HPV vaccination may result in a higher uptake of HP...|$|E
40|$|A 25 -year-old {{black man}} had a 20 -year history of disseminated plaques on his body. Two years before {{consultation}} he noticed several tumors on the genitalia. Physical examination revealed generalized, coalescing, hypopigmented plaques with a very defined and keratotic border that resembled actinic porokeratosis. (Fig. 1). Multiple verrucous and moist tumors were observed on the scrotum (Fig. 2). His past medical history was unremarkable, and no family member had the disease. Histology of the body lesions revealed hyperkeratosis with a horny-layer, basket-weave appearance, large and clear blue–gray keratinocytes with finely granular cytoplasm and vacuolized nuclei, and abundant keratohyaline granules located in the upper epidermal layer (Fig. 3). Scrotum biopsy showed hyperkeratosis, irregular acanthosis with papillomatosis, and koilocytic figures. The genital lesions were treated with monthly cryotherapy plus surgical excision with complete disappearance of the lesions. A decrease in ultraviolet exposure and daily sun-block were encouraged for epidermodysplasia verruciformis lesions. After <b>genital</b> <b>wart</b> clearance, follow-ups are being scheduled every 4 months, with no new lesions to date...|$|E
