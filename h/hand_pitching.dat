50|$|In August, the Marlins offense {{would take}} off. Rookie Chris Coghlan set a club record with ten {{consecutive}} multihit games. In addition, the Marlins would set a team record with 14 consecutive games with 10 or more hits, {{becoming the first}} team since the 1937 St. Louis Browns to reach that milestone. August would also see the Marlins sweeping the division leading Philadelphia Phillies after getting swept by the division cellar Washington Nationals. In light {{of being in the}} playoff race, the Marlins were rumored to have been targeting veteran pitchers John Smoltz and ex-Marlin Brad Penny. The Marlins ended the 2009 Season with their 3rd best record in franchise history, 87-75, topped only by the 1997 (92 wins) and 2003 (91) World Series championship teams. However, the status of Fredi González for the 2010 season was put in question when a report by ESPN's Buster Olney said the Marlins had made contact with Bobby Valentine. The Marlins put those rumors to rest days later confirming that the all-time winningest manager in franchise history would remain at the helm. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>pitching</b> coach Mark Wiley and infield/first-base coach Andy Fox were not retained.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to control the amplitude of shock unsteadiness associated with the interaction induced by a (i) 24 o compression corner and, (ii) a cylindrical obstruction on a flat plate in a Mach 2 flow. The control was applied {{in the form of}} an array of steady micro air-jets of different configurations with variation in pitch angle (β) and skew angle (α) of the jets. The overall flow interaction gets modified for all control configurations and shows a reduction in both separation- and bow-shock strengths and in triple-point height. A significant reduction in σmax /Pw value is also observed in the intermittent region of separation for each case. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>pitching</b> or skewing the jets to 45 o or both reduces the obstruction component considerably that initially, at lower control pressure, shows lower effectiveness (relative to 90 o pitched jets). But at higher control pressure, the effectiveness of these configurations continues to increase unlike the 90 o pitched jets...|$|E

5000|$|On January 16, 2012, the Rockies traded Smith to the Oakland Athletics for Guillermo Moscoso and Josh Outman. Due to his severe splits between facing right handed {{and left}} <b>handed</b> <b>pitching,</b> Smith platooned {{in his two}} seasons in Oakland. He hit [...]246 with 22 home runs for the A's between 2012 and 2013.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to control the amplitude of shock unsteadiness associated with the interaction induced by a cylindrical protuberance on a flat plate in a Mach 2. 18 flow. The control was applied {{in the form of}} an array of steady micro air-jets of different configurations with variation in pitch (β) and skew angle (α) of the jets. The effect of air-jet supply pressure on control was also studied. Each of the micro-jet configurations was placed 20 boundary layer thicknesses upstream of the leading edge of the cylinder. The overall interaction is seen to get modified for all control configurations and shows a reduction in both separation- and bow-shock strengths and in triple-point height. A significant reduction in the peak rms value is also observed in the intermittent region of separation for each case. For 90 o pitched jets placed in a zig-zag configuration, good control effectiveness is achieved at control pressures similar to the stagnation pressure of the freestream. At higher control pressures, however, their obstruction component increases and if these jets are not spaced sufficiently far apart, the effectiveness of their control begins to drop due to the beginning of spanwise jet-to-jet interaction. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>pitching</b> or skewing the jets to 45 o reduces the obstruction component considerably which at lower control pressures, shows lower effectiveness. But at higher control pressure, the effectiveness of these configurations continues to increase unlike the 90 o pitched jets...|$|E
50|$|Sound is {{measured}} {{based on the}} amplitude and {{frequency of a sound}} wave. Noise is most commonly discussed in terms of decibels (dB), the measure of loudness, or intensity of a sound; this measurement describes the amplitude of a sound wave. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>pitch</b> describes the frequency of a sound and {{is measured}} in hertz (Hz).|$|R

5000|$|Toles {{returned}} to the Dodgers in 2017, making their Opening Day starting lineup. Toles became the Dodgers primary leadoff hitter and starting left fielder against right <b>handed</b> <b>pitching</b> for {{the first month of}} the season. However, on May 9 he tore his anterior cruciate ligament sliding into the outfield fence at Dodger Stadium against the Pittsburgh Pirates and was placed on the disabled list, ending his season.

5000|$|Important in theremin {{articulation}} {{is the use}} of {{the volume}} control antenna. Unlike touched instruments, where simply halting play or damping a resonator in the traditional sense silences the instrument, the thereminist must [...] "play the rests, as well as the notes", as Clara Rockmore observed. If the <b>pitch</b> <b>hand</b> is moved between notes, without first lowering the volume hand, the result is a [...] "swooping" [...] sound akin to a swanee whistle or a glissando played on the violin. Small flutters of the <b>pitch</b> <b>hand</b> can be used to produce a vibrato effect. To produce distinct notes requires a pecking action with the volume hand to mute the volume while the <b>pitch</b> <b>hand</b> moves between positions.|$|R

30|$|Pitch {{estimation}} in {{noisy environment}} {{is closely related}} to sound separation. If, on one hand, the mixed sound is separated, the pitch of each sound can be obtained relatively easily. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>pitch</b> is a very efficient grouping cue for sound separation and widely used in previous systems [8, 9, 15]. In the Hu and Wang model, a continuous pitch estimation method is proposed based on correlogram in which the T-F units are merged into segments according to cross-channel correlation and time continuity. Each segment is expected to be dominated by a single voiced sound. At first, they employed the longest segment as a criterion to initially separate the segments into foreground and background. And then, the pitch contour is formed using units in foreground and followed by sequential linear interpolation, more details can be found in [9].|$|R
50|$|A pitcher must {{indicate}} visually to the umpire-in-chief, {{the batter}} and any runners the hand {{with which he}} intends to pitch, which may be done by wearing his glove {{on the other hand}} while touching the pitcher's plate. The pitcher is not permitted to pitch with the other hand until the batter is retired, the batter becomes a runner, the inning ends, the batter is substituted for by a pinch-hitter or the pitcher incurs an injury. In the event a pitcher switches <b>pitching</b> <b>hands</b> during an at-bat because he has suffered an injury, the pitcher may not, {{for the remainder of the}} game, <b>pitch</b> with the <b>hand</b> from which he has switched. The pitcher shall not be given the opportunity to throw any preparatory pitches after switching <b>pitching</b> <b>hands.</b> Any change of <b>pitching</b> <b>hands</b> must be indicated clearly to the umpire-in-chief.|$|R

5000|$|Latin, like English, was {{characterized}} by a stress accent, whereas ancient Greek {{was characterized}} by a pitch accent. In English poetry, accent governs the stress-timed rhythm. In ancient Greek poetry, on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>pitch</b> accent rose and fell independently of the mora timed rhythm, just as musical pitch is not governed by the duration of musical notes. Some modern scholars {{have suggested that the}} stress accent in Latin turned into a pitch accent under the Greek influence and thus Latin verse could have functioned in the melodic manner of Greek verse, yet most scholars today reject such a theory as unrealistic. Latin poets might instead have recited long and short syllables as if they were stressed and unstressed, or, more probably, they gave words their natural stress, so that the quantitative metrical pattern acted like an orderly undercurrent to natural speech. Here, for example, is dactylic verse from Virgil's Georgics when the words are given their natural stress: ...|$|R

On the other <b>hand,</b> the <b>pitch</b> was slightly slower than was customary throughout the series, and Larwood was suffering from problems with his boots which reduced his effectiveness.|$|R
30|$|It is well {{established}} that there are various types of plasma waves other than the whistler-mode chorus in the equatorial region, such as electromagnetic ion cyclotron wave (EMIC) (Young et al. 1981; Kasahara et al. 1992; Sakaguchi et al. 2013; Min et al. 2012; Usanova et al. 2012; Matsuda et al. 2014 a; and the references therein) and magnetosonic wave (MSW) (Laakso et al. 1990; Kasahara et al. 1994; Fraser and Nguyen 2001; Santolik et al. 2004, 2016; and the references therein). It was also suggested {{that in addition to}} the whistler-mode chorus, the MSW {{plays an important role in}} acceleration processes in the inner magnetosphere (e.g., Horne et al. 2007; Meredith et al. 2008). On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>pitch</b> angle scattering caused by the EMIC is thought to be one plausible loss mechanism that contributes to relativistic electron precipitation (Miyoshi et al. 2008; Jordanova et al. 2008; Shprits et al. 2016). Furthermore, there are additional suggestions that plasmaspheric hiss (Breneman et al. 2015) and VLF radio transmitters (Baker et al. 2014) could play important roles in the electron loss process in the radiation belt.|$|R
5000|$|The Indians {{entered the}} 2013 season {{following}} an active offseason {{that resulted in}} a dramatic roster turnover. Key acquisitions included free agent 1B/OF Nick Swisher and CF Michael Bourn. The Indians also added prized right <b>handed</b> <b>pitching</b> prospect Trevor Bauer, OF Drew Stubbs, and relief pitchers Bryan Shaw & Matt Albers in a three-way trade with the Arizona Diamondbacks and Cincinnati Reds that sent RF Shin-Soo Choo to the Reds, and Tony Sipp to the Arizona Diamondbacks Other notable additions included utility man Mike Aviles, catcher Yan Gomes, designated hitter Jason Giambi, and starting pitcher Scott Kazmir. [...] The 2013 Indians were able to increase their win total by 24 over 2012 (from 68 to 92), finishing in second place behind Detroit by one game in the Central Division, and securing the number one seed in the American League Wild Card standings. This marked the Indians' first time in postseason play since 2007. The 2013 season ended for the Indians on October 2, losing 4-0 to the Tampa Bay Rays in the 2013 AL Wild Card Game. The turnaround from 2012 also led to Francona winning the 2013 American League Manager of the Year Award.|$|R
