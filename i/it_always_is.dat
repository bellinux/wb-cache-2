500|$|In 1918, Noether {{published}} a seminal {{paper on the}} inverse Galois problem. Instead of determining the Galois group of transformations of a given field and its extension, Noether asked whether, given a field and a group, <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>is</b> possible to find {{an extension of the}} field that has the given group as its Galois group. She reduced this to [...] "Noether's problem", which asks whether the fixed field of a subgroup G of the permutation group S'n acting on the field [...] always is a pure transcendental extension of the field k. (She first mentioned this problem in a 1913 paper, where she attributed the problem to her colleague Fischer.) She showed this was true for , 3, or 4. In 1969, R. G. Swan found a counter-example to Noether's problem, with [...] and G a cyclic group of order 47 (although this group can be realized as a Galois group over the rationals in other ways). The inverse Galois problem remains unsolved.|$|E
500|$|On 3 January, Western journalists {{toured the}} deserted Ap Bac hamlet with American advisors. When {{reporter}} Neil Sheehan asked Brig. Gen. Robert York what had happened, the general replied: [...] "What the hell's {{it look like}} happened, boy? They got away, that's what happened"! Shortly afterwards, more than 18 hours too late, the South Vietnamese hit Ap Bac with an artillery barrage. The artillery rounds killed another five South Vietnamese soldiers and wounded 14 others. Vann, who had made key decisions in the early phases of the battle, blamed the South Vietnamese for the debacle. [...] "It was a miserable damn performance, just like <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>is.</b> These people won't listen. They {{make the same mistake}} {{over and over again in}} the same way". According to Moyar (2008), in blaming the South Vietnamese, Vann wanted to conceal the Americans' flawed intelligence and poor leadership. He hoped to pressure the South Vietnamese to accept future changes he favored.|$|E

2500|$|First Sergeant William L. Umbles was demoted on that day. The exact {{reasons are}} uncertain. Some said Nolan was displeased with him. It {{might have been}} that Umbles tried to {{convince}} Nolan to turn back. It {{may have been the}} last straw in Nolan's trust in the First Sergeant after the alcohol incident. The two men would be silent on the exact reason later. But many agreed Umbles was angry and his behavior would show [...] during [...] "The Thirsting Time" [...] to come. The buffalo hunters came back to camp excited at finding a large trail of sign and Tafoya estimated 40 Comanche in the band near Rich Lake. Boots and saddles were called and the men made haste to get under way.

2500|$|Bernini's St. Peter's {{baldachin}} imitates {{in bronze}} a cloth canopy above, and thus has some {{claim to be}} called a [...] "baldachin", as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>is.</b> [...] A number of other Baroque ciboria, and secular architectural canopies, copied this conceit, for example Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. [...] The voluted top of the Bernini baldachin was also copied by a number of French architects, often producing structures around an altar with no actual canopy or roof, just columns arrayed in an approximate curve (a [...] "rotunda altar"), with only an architrave and volutes above. Examples are at the churches at Val-de-Grâce (François Mansart and Jacques Lemercier, 1660s) and Saint-Louis-des-Invalides Cathedral (Jules Hardouin Mansart, 1706) in Paris, Angers Cathedral, Verdun Cathedral, Notre-Dame de Mouzon in Mouzon, Saint-Sauveur in Rennes, and the Saint-Sauveur Basilica in Dinan. [...] These are usually called baldachins (not at Angers), and many have certainly departed from the traditional form of the ciborium. [...] There is a Rococo German example at Worms Cathedral; many German Rococo churches used similar styles that were engaged with the apse wall, or partly so. [...] In addition, according to the 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia articles on [...] "Baldachin" [...] and [...] "Ciborium", the Catholic Church opted, apparently in the 20th century, to use officially [...] "ciborium" [...] only for the vessel and [...] "baldachin" [...] for all architectural forms. [...] Architectural historians generally prefer to use [...] "ciborium" [...] at the least for all square four-column roofed forms.|$|E
