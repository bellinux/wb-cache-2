5|$|Complementary therapies {{have been}} {{investigated}} for treating people with acne. Low-quality evidence suggests topical application of tea tree oil or bee venom may reduce {{the total number of}} skin lesions in those with acne. Tea tree oil is thought to be approximately as effective as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, but has been associated with allergic contact dermatitis. Proposed mechanisms for tea tree oil's anti-acne effects include antibacterial action against P. acnes, and anti-inflammatory properties. Numerous other plant-derived therapies have been observed to have positive effects against acne (e.g., basil oil and oligosaccharides from seaweed); however, few studies have been performed, and most have been of lower methodological quality. There is a lack of <b>high-quality</b> <b>evidence</b> for the use of acupuncture, herbal medicine, or cupping therapy for acne.|$|E
25|$|Early {{evidence}} {{suggested that}} antibiotic treatment of male partners could re-establish the normal microbiota {{of the male}} urogenital tract and prevent the recurrence of infection. However, a 2016 Cochrane review found <b>high-quality</b> <b>evidence</b> that treating the sexual partners of women with bacterial vaginosis {{had no effect on}} symptoms, clinical outcomes, or recurrence in the affected women. It also found that such treatment may lead treated sexual partners to report increased adverse events.|$|E
25|$|A 2014 Cochrane review found eight {{clinical}} trials examining garlic {{as a treatment}} for the common cold; it excluded seven due to methodological flaws. The remaining trial, having moderate quality of evidence, concluded that people who took garlic (dietary supplement with 180 milligrams of allicin content) daily over a three-month period had fewer colds. The review indicated there is insufficient evidence {{to determine the effects of}} garlic in preventing or treating the common cold. Other reviews concluded a similar absence of <b>high-quality</b> <b>evidence</b> for garlic having a significant effect on the common cold.|$|E

25|$|A 2014 {{systematic}} review {{concluded that there}} is insufficient evidence to determine {{the effectiveness of these}} clear aligners. Opinion is that they are likely useful for moderate front-teeth crowding. In those with teeth that are too far forward or backward, or rotated in the socket, the aligners are likely not as effective as conventional braces. More cases of relapse of the anterior teeth have been found with clear aligners compared with conventional braces. A 2013 Cochrane review found no <b>high-quality</b> <b>evidence</b> with respect to the management of the recurrence of lower-front-teeth misalignment following treatment.|$|E
25|$|Spasmolytics such as carisoprodol, cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone, and {{methocarbamol}} {{are commonly}} prescribed for {{low back pain}} or neck pain, fibromyalgia, tension headaches and myofascial pain syndrome. However, they are not recommended as first-line agents; in acute low back pain, they are not more effective than paracetamol or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and in fibromyalgia they are not more effective than antidepressants. Nevertheless, some (low-quality) evidence suggests muscle relaxants can add benefit to treatment with NSAIDs. In general, no <b>high-quality</b> <b>evidence</b> supports their use. No drug {{has been shown to}} be better than another, and all of them have adverse effects, particularly dizziness and drowsiness. Concerns about possible abuse and interaction with other drugs, especially if increased sedation is a risk, further limit their use. A muscle relaxant is chosen based on its adverse-effect profile, tolerability, and cost.|$|E
25|$|For neck pain, {{manipulation}} and mobilization produce similar changes, and manual therapy and exercise {{are more effective}} than other strategies. A 2015 Cochrane systematic review found {{that there is no}} high quality evidence assessing the effectiveness of spinal manipulation for treating neck pain. Moderate to low quality evidence suggests that multiple spinal manipulation sessions may provide improved pain relief and an improvement in function when compared to certain medications. Due to the potential risks associated with spinal manipulation, high quality randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the clinical role of spinal manipulation. A 2007 systematic review reported that there is moderate- to <b>high-quality</b> <b>evidence</b> that subjects with chronic neck pain, not due to whiplash and without arm pain and headaches, show clinically important improvements from a course of spinal manipulation or mobilization. There is not enough evidence to suggest that spinal manipulation is an effective long-term treatment for whiplash although there are short term benefits.|$|E

500|$|It is {{traditionally}} believed that so-called [...] "deep" [...] infections—such as osteomyelitis or infective endocarditis—should {{be treated with}} bactericidal antibiotics, not bacteriostatic ones. Nevertheless, preclinical studies were conducted to assess the efficacy of linezolid for these infections, and the drug has been used successfully to treat them in clinical practice. Linezolid {{appears to be a}} reasonable therapeutic option for infective endocarditis caused by multi-resistant Gram-positive bacteria, despite a lack of <b>high-quality</b> <b>evidence</b> to support this use. Results in the treatment of enterococcal endocarditis have varied, with some cases treated successfully and others not responding to therapy. Low- to medium-quality evidence is also mounting for its use in bone and joint infections, including chronic osteomyelitis, although adverse effects are a significant concern when long-term use is necessary.|$|E
500|$|In {{animal studies}} of {{meningitis}} caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, linezolid {{was found to}} penetrate well into cerebrospinal fluid, but its effectiveness was inferior {{to that of other}} antibiotics. There {{does not appear to be}} enough <b>high-quality</b> <b>evidence</b> to support the routine use of linezolid to treat bacterial meningitis. Nonetheless, it has been used successfully in many cases of central nervous system infection—including meningitis—caused by susceptible bacteria, and has also been suggested as a reasonable choice for this indication when treatment options are limited or when other antibiotics have failed. The guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend linezolid as the first-line drug of choice for VRE meningitis, and as an alternative to vancomycin for MRSA meningitis. Linezolid appears superior to vancomycin in treating community-acquired MRSA infections of the central nervous system, although very few cases of such infections have been published (...) [...]|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} between diet and acne is unclear, {{as there is}} no <b>high-quality</b> <b>evidence</b> that establishes any definitive link between them. High-glycemic-load diets have been found to have different degrees of effect on acne severity. Multiple randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized studies have found a lower-glycemic-load diet to be effective in reducing acne. There is weak observational evidence suggesting that dairy milk consumption is positively associated with a higher frequency and severity of acne. Milk contains whey protein and hormones such as bovine IGF-1 and precursors of dihydrotestosterone. These components are hypothesized to promote the effects of insulin and IGF-1 and thereby [...] increase the production of androgen hormones, sebum, and promote the formation of comedones. [...] Effects from other potentially contributing dietary factors, such as consumption of chocolate or salt, are not supported by the evidence. Chocolate does contain varying amounts of sugar, which can lead to a high glycemic load, and it can be made with or without milk. Few studies have examined the {{relationship between}} obesity and acne. Vitamin B12 may trigger skin outbreaks similar to acne (acneiform eruptions), or worsen existing acne, when taken in doses exceeding the recommended daily intake.|$|E
40|$|WHO and UNICEF {{recommend}} {{the use of}} “ready-to-use therapeutic food” (RUTF) {{in the treatment of}} severely acute malnourished (SAM) children with no complicated medical background. This research paper aims to review the evidence on the use of RUTF in the treatment of SAM children, explore the potential issues with the use of RUTF, and provide suggestions for future research. A total of 7 studies were included for the review on the effectiveness of RUTF treatment. Evidences showed a general improvement in the health outcomes of SAM children, yet failed to yield <b>high-quality</b> <b>evidences</b> to prove its benefits.

30|$|Microbiological {{cultures}} {{should be}} performed in critically ill neutropenic patients [64]. Bacterial identification may help in de-escalating antibiotic therapy, limiting exposure to wide-spectrum therapy and therefore limiting the risk of subsequent multidrug-resistant bacterial infection or colonization [130, 131]. Empirical use of anti-gram-positive antibiotic therapy should {{be associated with a}} search for methicillin-resistant S. aureus colonization. The sensitivity of this screening approaches 100  % [132]. Should the results of microbiological cultures and colonization screening for resistant gram-positive bacteria be negative, empirical therapy should probably be reconsidered and in most of the clinical scenarios discontinued. Among receiving antipseudomonal β-lactam agents [2], de-escalation in patients with susceptible organisms or stable clinical condition may be considered and seems safe [130]. Although the experts advocated de-escalation in above-mentioned situations, <b>high-quality</b> <b>evidences</b> are needed in this field.|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} the net clinical {{benefit of a}} new treatment strategy, information on both survival and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) is required. However, to make an adequately informed decision, PRO evidence should be of sufficiently high quality. To investigate the methodological quality of PRO reporting in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with brain tumours, and to assess the proportion of studies that should impact clinical decision-making. We conducted a systematic literature search in several databases covering January 2004 to March 2012. We selected relevant RCTs and retrieved the following data: (1) basic trial demographics and PRO characteristics, (2) quality of PRO reporting and (3) risk of bias. Studies that should impact clinical decision-making based on their methodological robustness were analysed systematically. We identified 14 RCTs, representing over 3000 glioma patients. Only two RCTs (14 %) satisfied sufficiently many key methodological criteria to provide <b>high-quality</b> PRO <b>evidence,</b> and should therefore impact clinical decision-making. Important methodological limitations in other studies were lack of reporting of the extent (43 %) and reasons (86 %) of missing data and statistical approaches to handle this (71 %).
