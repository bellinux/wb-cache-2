25|$|In {{the first}} half of the game at the University of San Diego, the Cougar's offense was the star, with Jambga {{assisting}} Ebbesen with one crossing pass and then sending a second to Hull, who was one-on-one with a charging keeper.In the second half, the SIUE defense seemed to be playing with the USD offense, as if daring them to try to score by repeatedly taking the ball away and giving <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>back</b> for the Toreros to make another attempt. When the defenders were not blocking or stealing, Dal Santo made five saves, and the Cougars got the 2–0 win.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} closely contested by {{throughout}} the night as the lead changed 12 separate times, and the game was tied on 18 occasions. Regulation {{was not enough to}} settle this game, so the game went into overtime. The Pistons streaked out to a quick lead in the first few minutes of overtime, and seemed to have the game in hand. However, a missed layup by Chauncey Billups with Detroit ahead 95-93 with nine seconds left San Antonio with a chance. On the Spurs' next possession, Robert Horry inbounded the ball to Ginobili, who headed for the left corner and dished <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>back</b> to Horry. Rasheed Wallace had left Horry to double-team Ginobili, and Horry was left alone to sink the game-winning basket with 5.8 seconds remaining in the OT. Horry was already famous for nailing last-second shots in the playoffs, including Game Four of the 2002 Western Conference Finals between the Lakers and Sacramento Kings.|$|E

50|$|Video Game Theory {{applied to}} life. In video games, {{recognition}} is {{offered in the}} various forms of energetic response (positive reinforcement) for positive explorations and attainments and for not breaking rules.

NHA energetically parallels this in the actuality of life. Sports game theory can be applied when using with adults.|$|R
