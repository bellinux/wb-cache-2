5|$|Returning {{home from}} Belgrade on 6 February, the {{aeroplane}} carrying Edwards {{and his team}} mates crashed on takeoff after a refuelling stop in Munich, Germany. Seven players and 14 other passengers died at the scene, and Edwards {{was taken to the}} Rechts der Isar Hospital with multiple leg fractures, fractured ribs and severely damaged kidneys. The doctors treating him were confident that he stood some chance of recovery, but were doubtful that he would <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to play football again.|$|E
5|$|Gilberto's doctor {{ordered him}} to wear a back brace for three months to aid the healing of the {{fractured}} bone. Gilberto returned to his native Brazil {{for the duration of}} his rehabilitation. During his time there, he doubted whether he would <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to play football again, due to speculation that his injury could threaten his career. Despite his concerns, his long rehabilitation time paid off as he made a full recovery. He made his footballing comeback in Arsenal's 4–1 victory over Norwich City on 22 April 2005. During the whole 2004–05 season, Gilberto was injured for 7 months and played only 17 games. His absence, combined with Arsenal's slump in form at the time, led to much discussion regarding the importance of Gilberto to the Arsenal team; some suggesting that Arsenal struggled without him. Gilberto's difficult 2004–05 season ended in consolation as Arsenal finished runners-up in the Premier League and won the FA Cup against Manchester United in a penalty shoot-out.|$|E

25|$|On 22 December 1845, Peder Ludvig Møller, {{who studied}} at the University of Copenhagen {{at the same time}} as Kierkegaard, {{published}} an article indirectly criticizing Stages on Life's Way. The article complimented Kierkegaard for his wit and intellect, but questioned whether he would <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to master his talent and write coherent, complete works. Møller was also a contributor to and editor of The Corsair, a Danish satirical paper that lampooned everyone of notable standing. Kierkegaard published a sarcastic response, charging that Møller's article was merely an attempt to impress Copenhagen's literary elite.|$|E

25|$|His rotator-cuff injury {{diagnosed}} in March 1997 kept {{him away from}} cricket till November 1997. Until that time, {{he was a real}} express bowler. This injury was very serious (caused due to overload of bowling) and Srinath at that time had 92 Test wickets from 27 Tests- only 46 in his first 18 Tests, but 46 in his last 9 games. It was wondered if Srinath would <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to bowl again, let alone be ranked among the fastest bowlers in the world. After he announced his retirement in Nov 2003, Srinath revealed that he feared his career was over when he was trying to recover from the rotator-cuff injury. (See para 14 of this article).|$|E
25|$|After Voldemort's death, Harry {{uses the}} Elder Wand to repair his own damaged wand, then decides {{to return it}} to Dumbledore's tomb, {{so that when he}} has a natural death, the Elder Wand's power will die with him. In the film, Harry realizes that the Elder Wand is too {{powerful}} to fall into the wrong hands again, so he snaps it in two and throws it off a bridge. He also drops the Resurrection Stone in the Forbidden Forest but decides not to look for it in the hope that no wizard or witch will <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to own all three Hallows. He keeps the Cloak he had inherited, with the thought that he might pass it on to his children someday.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} the switch in {{strategy}} is disputed. Some historians argue the change in strategy lost the Luftwaffe the opportunity of winning the air battle, or air superiority. Others argue the Luftwaffe achieved little in the air battle and the RAF {{was not on the}} verge of collapse, as often claimed. Another perspective has also been put forward, which suggests the Germans could not have gained air superiority before the weather window closed. Others have said that it was unlikely the Luftwaffe would <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to destroy RAF Fighter Command. If British losses became severe, the RAF could simply have withdrawn northward and regrouped. It could then deploy when, or if, the Germans launched an invasion. Most historians agree Sea Lion would have failed regardless, because of the weaknesses of German sea power compared to the Royal Navy.|$|E

25|$|Controllability and {{observability}} are main {{issues in}} the analysis of a system before deciding the best control strategy to be applied, or whether it is even possible to control or stabilize the system. Controllability is related to the possibility of forcing the system into a particular state by using an appropriate control signal. If a state is not controllable, then no signal will <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to control the state. If a state is not controllable, but its dynamics are stable, then the state is termed stabilizable. Observability instead is related to the possibility of observing, through output measurements, the state of a system. If a state is not observable, the controller {{will never be able to}} determine the behavior of an unobservable state and hence cannot use it to stabilize the system. However, similar to the stabilizability condition above, if a state cannot be observed it might still be detectable.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, {{during a}} massive hallucinogenic trip, his {{subconscious}} tells him through images {{of his mother}} {{that he has to}} leave Hub City to <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to live happily. This viewpoint is bolstered by the utter societal collapse the city. Around the same time, Richard Dragon comes to see Vic, as Richard has sensed that Vic {{is on the verge of}} a major turning point in his life, and convinces Vic that living in Hub City is killing him. In an agreement with Richard, Lady Shiva arrives with a helicopter to usher The Question and Aristotle Rodor away, at which point she decides to stay in Hub City and embrace the chaos. Vic nearly convinces Myra to come with him and escape the chaos of the city. Myra remembers the people of the city who need her, mainly the children. She leaves Jackie, her mentally handicapped daughter, in Sage's care and goes back to do what she can.|$|E
25|$|Andrija Hebrang accused his party's dissidents, Vidošević and Primorac, {{as well as}} most right-wing {{candidates}} for 'stealing' his votes saying the result was that two left-wingers would face-off in the second round. Despite this, he called the election a great victory of the right claiming that right-leaning candidates combined achieved better results that left-leaning candidates combined. In making this assertion, he failed to consider Bandić as left-leaning, and ignored Vidošević's appeal to the left-leaning voters as well. Vidošević conceded defeat saying that one should never blame his failures on others, but himself. He urged the public to continue believing in a better tomorrow saying that Croatia should be a country of knowledge and justice, not of corruption and divisiveness. Pusić gave a short teary speech calling Croatia a country with a lot of potential with only the right leadership. She also noted that no government would <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to win without the support of HNS. Primorac said he would be forming a new party which would be independent from both HDZ and SDP and said he saw a bright future for Croatia.|$|E

J.B. Tribout, who first ascended the route, challenged Hill, saying no woman would <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to climb it—Hill completed it in fewer tries than Tribout, after [...] "nine days of exhausting effort".

500|$|The Great Dictator {{spent a year}} in {{production}} and was released in October 1940. The film generated a vast amount of publicity, with a critic for The New York Times calling it [...] "the most eagerly awaited picture of the year", {{and it was one of}} the biggest money-makers of the era. The ending was unpopular, however, and generated controversy. Chaplin concluded the film with a five-minute speech in which he abandoned his barber character, looked directly into the camera, and pleaded against war and fascism. Charles J. Maland has identified this overt preaching as triggering a decline in Chaplin's popularity, and writes, [...] "Henceforth, no movie fan would <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to separate the dimension of politics from [...] star image". The Great Dictator received five Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor.|$|E
500|$|Hans-Joachim Bremermann, a {{professor}} of mathematics and biophysics at the University of California at Berkeley, further argued in a 1965 paper that the [...] "speed, memory, and processing capacity of any possible future computer equipment are limited by certain physical barriers: the light barrier, the quantum barrier, and the thermodynamical barrier. These limitations imply, for example, that no computer, however constructed, will <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to examine the entire tree of possible move sequences of the game of chess." [...] Nonetheless, Bremermann did not foreclose {{the possibility that a}} computer would someday be able to solve chess. He wrote, [...] "In order to have a computer play a perfect or nearly perfect game [...] it will be necessary either to analyze the game completely ... or to analyze the game in an approximate way and combine this with a limited amount of tree searching. ... A theoretical understanding of such heuristic programming, however, is still very much wanting." ...|$|E
500|$|Thirty-nine {{individuals}} who played professional baseball {{at the major}} league level lack identified given names. Identification of players remains difficult {{due to a lack}} of biographical information; a Brooklyn, New York, directory, for instance, lists more than 30 men who could be the professional player [...] "Stoddard". Possible mistakes in reading 19th-century box scores could have also led to players without given names, as [...] "Eland", for example, could be another player from the Baltimore Marylands roster whose name was simply misread. Philadelphia Athletics manager Bill Sharsig signed four of the 39, [...] "local players" [...] McBride, Stafford, Sterling, and Sweigert, for Philadelphia's last game of the season against the Syracuse Stars on October 12, 1890. Sterling pitched five innings for the Athletics and conceded 12 runs. McBride, Philadelphia's center fielder, and Stafford, the team's right fielder, both failed to reach base, but left fielder Sweigert reached base on a walk and stole a base. Society for American Baseball Research writer Bill Carle [...] "doubt we will <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to identify them".|$|E
