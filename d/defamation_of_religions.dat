50|$|In early 2011, with declining {{support for}} the <b>defamation</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> {{approach}} {{and at the time}} of the Arab Spring, which was in part due to a lack of freedom of speech, political freedoms, poor living conditions, corruption, and rising food prices, there was a real possibility that another resolution on the <b>defamation</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> would be defeated. The OIC shifted position and opted to pusue an approach that would gain the support from both OIC and Western countries. On March 24, 2011, the UN Human Rights Council in a very significant move shifted from protecting beliefs to the protection of believers with the unanimous adoption without a vote of Resolution 16/18 introduced by Pakistan.|$|R

A growing anti-religious culture and rhetoric is a central source of defamation of all religions and discrimination against their believers and practitioners.

This contribution investigates whether European states can legitimately criminalise (certain forms <b>of)</b> <b>defamation</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> and belief, in light of the European Convention on Human Rights, the United Nations framework (particularly the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights) and legal theoretical considerations.

5000|$|Zamir Akram (Pakistan) {{wrote to}} the Ad Hoc Committee on 29 October 2009 {{to explain why the}} OIC would not abandon the idea <b>of</b> <b>defamation</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion.</b> Akram's letter states: The OIC is {{concerned}} by the instrumentalization <b>of</b> <b>religions</b> through distortion or ridicule aimed at demeaning and provoking their followers to violence as well as at promoting contempt towards religious communities in order to de-humanize their constituent members with purpose of justifying advocacy of racial and religious hatred and violence against these individuals. The letter says <b>defamation</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> has been [...] "wrongly linked with malafide intentions to its perceived clash with" [...] the freedom of opinion and expression. The letter declares: All religions are sacred and merit equal respect and protection. Double standards, including institutional preferential treatment for one <b>religion</b> or group <b>of</b> people must be avoided. The OIC demands similar sanctity for all religions, their religious personalities, symbols and followers. Tolerance and understanding cannot merely be addressed through open debate and inter-cultural dialogue as defamation trends are spreading to the grass root levels. These growing tendencies need to be checked by introducing a single universal international human rights framework.|$|R

There were also varying degrees of dissent for most of the various reports criticising Israel; while on the other hand a large number of resolutions were taken unanimously without voting, including the rather severe criticism of Myanmar (resolutions 31 and 32), and the somewhat less severe on Sudan (resolution 16).|$|E

Resolution 16/18 was supported by both OIC member countries and Western countries, including the United States.|$|R
50|$|In March 2013 Mchangama {{dismissed}} the “putative consensus” around UN Human Rights Counsil Resolution 16/18, which {{was seen as}} resolving divisions between free-speech advocates and those who would criminalize <b>defamation</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion,</b> as a “charade.” While the US saw the resolution as affrming First Amendment-style speech rights, Pakistan saw it as banning “advocacy of religious hatred.” In the middle were Europeans, who, Mchangama pointed out, were often eager to defend Islam from criticism. While praising the US for “standing firm {{on the need to}} counter intolerance and hatred through debate rather than censorship,” Mchangama called on the US to vigorously confront other interpretations of R 16/18.|$|R
