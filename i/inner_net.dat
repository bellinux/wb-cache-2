40|$|Abstract only. The use of {{floating}} cages as nursery for Penaeus monodon postlarvae was tried at the Batan, Aklan Substation of the SEAFDEC Aquaculture Department. The cages {{were made of}} bamboo and measured 2 Ã— 5 Ã— 1. 5 m (effective volume 10 m 3) with cement-coated styrofoam sheets as floats. Two nets were installed inside a cage. The outer net (3 mm mesh size) protects the <b>inner</b> <b>net</b> (0. 5 mm mesh size) from floating debris in the bay. The cages were installed offshore where water depth was at least 2 m during the lowest tide, and were attached to bamboo posts by metal rings. Postlarvae were stocked at ages ranging from PL 5 to PL 16. Feed consisted of raw ground fish paste applied to a feeding net which also served as substrate. Average survival based on 25 production runs was 40. 98 % after 2 to 3 weeks of culture. Stocking density ranged from 4, 000 to 16, 895 PL/m 3. Unlike nursery tanks, this system is easier to manage and needs no aeration and pumping, thus reducing operational costs.

40|$|Natural Language (NL) is {{the main}} {{communication}} media for humans, who have a deep need for communicating based on evolutionary mechanisms. This inner-need implied the development of languages. Proto-humans had to name objects around, feelings, memories, expectations, and etcetera.

Some layers of the brain were devoted to handle the relations between an <b>inner</b> <b>net</b> of concepts with the areas concerning the treatment of language. The NL spoken by humans has a complex construction, based on the diversity of meaning for words and expressions according to the context. Besides, there are different cases of languages. Our work is aimed at presenting a multi-agent approach for dealing with the problem of discovering the intention in expressions written in Spanish and inside Web forums. We are also looking for the identification of some relations among participants in the Web forum. Although the conversations in these forums are usually built in some point between formal and informal communications, and would not follow grammatical rules in every case, we have made arrangements to deal with many of the situations present in Web forums and provide an adaptive response for most of the cases...|$|E

40|$|Isolated frog {{skin was}} bathed with a dilute {{solution}} containing 1 mm NaCl {{on the outside}} and with normal Ringer’s solution on the <b>inner</b> surface. <b>Net</b> Na flux was determined by simultaneous measurement of unidirectional fluxes with Na 22 and Na 24 and intracellular electrical potentials were examined with microelectrodes. There was a net inward transport of Na under both open-circuit and short-circuit conditions. The short-circuit current was approximately 15 % greater than the net Na flux; the discrepancy could be accounted for by a small outward flux of Cl. The electrical potential profile did not differ greatly from that observed in skins bathed on the outside with normal Ringer’s solution. Under open-circuit conditions, there were usually several potential steps and under short-circuit conditions the cells were negative relative to the bathing solutions. Estimates of epithelial Na concentrations utilizing radioactive Na suggested that if all epithelial Na were in a single compartment, an active entry step would be necessary to allow a net inward Na transport. The results could also be explained by a series arrangement of Na compartments without necessarily postulating an active Na entry. The behavior of the potential profile suggested that this latter alternative was more likely...|$|R

In the present study, a model cage was fabricated and tested in a towing tank under different waves and current load conditions. The tension on the mooring chain was measured during the experimental study, besides the towing speed and wave parameters. Based on the experimental data, drag coefficient for the cage net twine was estimated. The tensions in the mooring chain and the cage net twine of the prototype cage were predicted based on the model data.

40|$|We present {{measurements}} of along and across-shore sediment transport {{in a region}} of the Dutch coast 10 kilometers north of the Rhine River mouth. This section of the coast is characterized by strong vertical density stratification because it is within the mid-field region of the Rhine region of freshwater influence, where processes typical of the far-field, such as tidal straining, are modified by the passage of distinct freshwater lenses at the surface. The experiment captured two storms, and {{a wide range of}} wind, wave, tidal and stratification conditions. We focus primarily on the mechanisms leading to cross-shore sediment flux at a mooring location in 12 m of water, which are responsible for the exchange of sediment between the near-shore and the <b>inner</b> shelf. <b>Net</b> transport during storms was directed offshore and influenced by cross-shelf winds, while net transport during spring tides was determined by the mean state of stratification. Tidal straining dominated during neap tides; however, cross-shore transport was negligible due to small sediment concentrations. The passage of freshwater lenses manifested as strong pulses of offshore transport primarily during spring tides. We observe that both barotropic and baroclinic processes are relevant for cross-shore transport at depth and, since transport rates due to these competing processes were similar, the net transport direction will be determined by the frequency and sequencing of these modes of transport. Based on our observations, we find that wind- and wave-driven transport during storms tends move fine sediment offshore, while calmer, more stratified conditions move it back onshore...|$|R

Two recent case reports suggest that levamisole-adulterated cocaine may also lead to renal disease {{in the form of}} pauci-immune glomerulonephritis. To explore this possibility, we reviewed cases of pauci-immune glomerulonephritis between 2010 and 2012 at an <b>inner</b> city safety <b>net</b> hospital where the prevalence of levamisole in the cocaine supply is known to be high. We identified 3 female patients and 1 male patient who had biopsy-proven pauci-immune glomerulonephritis, used cocaine, and had serologic abnormalities characteristic of levamisole-induced autoimmunity. Each also had some other form of clinical disease known to be associated with levamisole, either neutropenia or cutaneous manifestations. One patient had diffuse alveolar hemor-rhage. Three of the 4 patients were treated with short courses of prednisone and cyclophosphamide, 2 of whom experienced stable long-term improvement in their renal function despite ongoing cocaine use.

40|$|Styles of glacial {{sedimentation}} {{and erosion}} in Prydz Bay respond to glacial and interglacial cycles {{and fall into}} three zones; an <b>inner</b> zone of <b>net</b> erosion, a middle zone of subglacially eroded and deformed transitional glacial marine deposits and an outer zone of subglacial till deposition and shelf progradation. The inner zone is the region of maximum basal shear stress and inner-shelf deep formation by enhanced erosion in areas where tributary glaciers converge with the extended Lambert Glacier. The middle zone is underlain by sediments deposited near the ice-grounding zone during retreat, both as blanket like deposits and as grounding-line moraines. This material is then deformed into elongate subglacial bedforms (megaflures or drumlins), a process that probably involves some erosion. Deforming subglacial bed conditions extend to the shelf edge within a valley crossing the shelf {{on the western side}} of Prydz Bay.

40|$|Abstract: The microvasculature of rabbit ovaries, {{with special}} {{regard to the}} interstitial-stromal tissue, was studied by {{scanning}} electron microscopy (SEM) of vascular corrosion casts. The casting medium (Mercox) was injected in normal animals and in animals in which ovulation was induced by 100 l. U. of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) i. v. Vascular baskets of different size and architecture related to follicles in various developmental stages were observed in the ovarian cortex. Small (primary) follicles showed thin and thready capillaries. Larger (secondary and antral) follicles showed a progressive increase in number, size and tortuosity of round-meshed capillaries, related to adaptation of the growing follicle to the approaching ovulation. Capillary sprouts, due to the enhanced angiogenesis of growing follicles, were seen. These aspects were more evident in ovulatory follicles. In addition, numerous resin leakages, due to the increased permeability of the sinusoidal net, were seen in the cavities of ovulatory follicles. Interstitial-stromal tissue capillaries were diffusely distributed in the cortex among the follicular baskets. Their morphology remained unchanged after hCG stimulus. In {{the periphery of the}} cortex, the microvascular net showed large (79 - 90 -mu-m) irregularly rounded meshes, with thin, thready capillaries often anastomosed with those of primary follicles. Inner cortex capillaries were thin, thready and arranged in polygonal meshes of 40 - 70 -mu-m. The arrangement and the distribution of the interstitial-stromal capillaries may have some special role during the cyclic activity of the ovary. In particular, they may be directly involved in the initial development of follicles with consequent differentiation of the theca (peripheral capillary net) and in promoting the vascular supply of steroid-secreting cells of stromal origin (<b>inner</b> cortex capillary <b>net)</b> ...|$|R
30|$|Having {{motivated}} {{the need for}} a multi-component plasma description throughout the solar wind–VLISM interaction region, a derivation of the multi-fluid plasma model was presented, based on the analysis of Zank et al. (2014) (and correcting some typos). The standard approach of simply using a set of multi-fluid equations under the assumption that all distributions are isotropic, as done by Zieger et al. (2015), is incorrect in that it neglects the basic physics of PUI scattering by pre-existing and self-excited fluctuations. Numerous observations of the flat-topped form of the PUI distribution in the solar wind show that wave-particle scattering is fundamental to the physics of PUIs—for a review, see Zank (1999). Wave-particle scattering of PUIs introduces a collisionless form of PUI heat conduction and viscosity through the PUI pressure tensor. These important dissipative terms need to be included in any description of a non-equilibrated PUI-mediated plasma. The model presented here is appropriate for use in models of the global heliosphere. In particular, in the inner heliosheath, the role of PUI and ACR heat flux is to partially decouple the full pressure contribution of the PUIs and energetic particles from the overall pressure, thereby reducing the effective thermodynamic pressure balancing the interstellar pressure against that of the <b>inner</b> heliosheath. The <b>net</b> effect should be a thinner heliosheath than predicted by conventional MHD models that over-estimate the total pressure contribution contributed by energetic particles. The new model equations should be used to explore the global structure of the solar wind–VLISM interaction eventually (but this is well beyond the current scope of the paper). Finally, we note that it is not completely obvious how or whether ENA fluxes would change. At leading order, the energy densities of the different ionized components should be largely unchanged in the IHS. The only difference is that the heat flux associated with energetic particles removes energy (i.e., reduces their pressure contribution) from the overall total pressure of the inner heliosheath. Because this could lead to a thinner heliosheath, the ENA flux could be reduced but because the heat flux causes the energetic ionized particles to diffuse to greater distances; the net effect may be that there is little change in the overall ENA fluxes.|$|R
40|$|The first {{measurements}} of atmospheric nitric oxide (NO) along with observations of ozone (O 3), hydroperoxides (H 2 O 2 and MHP) and snow nitrate (NO 3 –) on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) {{were carried out}} at the WAIS Divide deep ice-coring site between 10 December 2008 and 11 January 2009. Average ± 1 σ mixing ratios of NO were 19 ± 31 pptv and confirmed prior model estimates for the summer boundary layer above WAIS. Mean ± 1 σ mixing ratios of O 3 of 14 ± 4 ppbv were {{in the range of}} previous measurements from overland traverses across WAIS during summer, while average ± 1 σ concentrations of H 2 O 2 and MHP revealed higher levels with mixing ratios of 743 ± 362 and 519 ± 238 pptv, respectively. An upper limit for daily average NO 2 and NO emission fluxes from snow of 8. 6 × 10 8 and 33. 9 × 10 8 molecule cm – 2 s – 1, respectively, were estimated based on photolysis of measured NO 3 – and nitrite (NO 2 –) in the surface snowpack. The resulting high NO x emission flux may explain the little preservation of NO 3 – in snow (~ 30 %) when compared to Summit, Greenland (75 – 93 %). Assuming rapid and complete mixing into the overlying atmosphere, and steady state of NO x, these snow emissions are equivalent to an average (range) production of atmospheric NO x of 30 (21 – 566) pptv h – 1 for a typical atmospheric boundary-layer depth of 250 (354 – 13) m. These upper bounds indicate that local emissions from the snowpack are a significant source of short-lived nitrogen oxides above the <b>inner</b> WAIS. The <b>net</b> O 3 production of 0. 8 ppbv day – 1 triggered with NO higher than 2 pptv is too small to explain the observed O 3 variability. Thus, the origins of the air masses reaching WAIS Divide during this campaign were investigated with a 4 -day back-trajectory analysis every 4 h. The resulting 168 back trajectories revealed that in 75 % of all runs air originated from the Antarctic coastal slopes (58 %) and the inner WAIS (17 %). For these air sources O 3 levels were on average 13 ± 3 ppbv. The remaining 25 % are katabatic outflows from the East Antarctic Plateau above 2500 m. When near-surface air from the East Antarctic Plateau reaches WAIS Divide through a rapid transport of less than 3 days, O 3 levels are on average 19 ± 4 ppbv with maximum mixing ratios of 30 ppbv. Episodes of elevated ozone at WAIS Divide are therefore linked to air mass export off the East Antarctic Plateau, demonstrating that outflows from the highly oxidizing summer atmospheric boundary layer in the interior of the continent can episodically raise the mixing ratios of long-lived atmospheric chemical species such as O 3 and enhance the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere above WAIS...|$|R
