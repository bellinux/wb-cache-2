40|$|AbstractThis paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} Korea’s fair disclosure regulation on the timeliness and informativeness of earnings announcements. The present regulation for Korean listed firms requires that if a company’s sales revenue, operating income (or loss) and net income (or loss) have changed by over 30 % compared to the prior year, the firm must disclose this information through a preliminary <b>financial</b> <b>report</b> (PFR) even before the company is audited by external auditors. To analyze {{the effects of this}} policy, we first investigate the timeliness of preliminary <b>financial</b> <b>report</b> disclosures. We examine the extent to which Korean listed companies actually comply with the requirement for prompt notification of information concerning material changes in financial performance. Second, we investigate the informativeness of preliminary <b>financial</b> <b>reports</b> by analyzing differential stock market reactions to different timings of preliminary <b>financial</b> <b>report</b> disclosures. Our empirical results reveal {{that more than half of}} our sample firms release their preliminary <b>financial</b> <b>reports</b> after external audits are completed, thereby potentially invalidating the effectiveness of the regulation. In addition, we find that preliminary <b>financial</b> <b>reports</b> have information value only if they are disclosed prior to annual audit report dates. This finding supports the notion that timeliness increases the informativeness of preliminary <b>financial</b> <b>report</b> disclosure by curbing insiders’ ability to potentially profit from their information advantage...|$|R
25|$|It {{seems that}} around 1880 {{there was a}} change in {{manufacturing}} practice from companies with relatively homogeneous lines of products to horizontally integrated companies with unprecedented diversity in processes and products.

A variety of attempts to achieve this were unsuccessful due to the huge overhead of the information processing of the time. However, the burgeoning need for <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> after 1900 created unavoidable pressure for financial accounting of stock and the management need to cost manage products became overshadowed.
