5000|$|Bourgeois audiences {{appreciated}} Viarisio's [...] "brilliance" [...] — richly communicative, effervescent, {{and perfectly}} to their comfort — in amusing light comedies. In the sentimental comedies and white-telephone cinema of the 1930s, Viarisio {{was a constant}} figure, with his moustache and his black, shining hair combed to the back. He was the elegant interpreter of various pleasant stories adapted to film from the stage, such as Non ti conosco più (1936) by Nunzio Malasomma, L'uomo che sorride (1936) <b>and</b> <b>Questi</b> ragazzi (1937) by Mario Mattoli. Often he remained in {{the limits of the}} genre, but in some cases showed admirable creativity in his performances, keeping them fresh and memorable. This can be seen to best advantage in films like Il cappello a tre punte (1934) by Mario Camerini, Cavalleria (1936) by Goffredo Alessandrini and Quattro passi fra le nuvole (1942) by Allesandro Blasetti.|$|R

We improve upon the efficiency of the proof systems developed above and obtain proofs which can be verified probabilistically by examining only a constant number of (randomly chosen) bits of the proof.
