Who pushed for the baggy shorts? The black socks? <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> stodgy University of Michigan culture react to this bold, brash and outspoken team?" [...] Other columnists were also satisfied to learn that Rose came up with the shorts and Jackson came up with the socks. He also commended the film on its detail surrounding Chris Webber's infamous timeout in the 1993 NCAA championship. The same reviewer enumerated his five biggest omissions from the film: Michigan athletic director Bill Martin, 1991–92 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team, 1992–93 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team, Michael Talley and Webber. He was also critical of Mitch Albom's involvement with the Fab Five.|$|E

60|$|Fighting, for example, as I {{often say}} to myself, Fighting with steel murder-tools is surely a much uglier {{operation}} than Working, take it how you will. Yet even of Fighting, in religious Abbot Samson's days, {{see what a}} Feudalism there had grown,--a 'glorious Chivalry,' much besung down to the present day. Was not {{that one of the}} 'impossiblest' things? Under the sky is no uglier spectacle than two men with clenched teeth, and hell-fire eyes, hacking one another's flesh; converting precious living bodies, and priceless living souls, into nameless masses of putrescence, useful only for turnip-manure. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> Chivalry ever come out of that; how anything that was not hideous, scandalous, infernal? It will be a question worth considering by and by.|$|E
6000|$|The {{connection}} between the Arcadian Artemis, the Artemis of Brauron, and the common rituals and creeds of totemistic worship is now, perhaps, undeniably apparent. Perhaps in all the legend and all {{the cult of the}} goddess there is no more archaic element than this. The speech {{of the women in the}} Lysistrata, recalling the days of their childhood when they [...] "were bears," [...] takes us back to a remote past when the tribes settled at Brauron were bear-worshippers, and, in all probability, claimed to be of the bear stock or kindred. Their distant descendants still imitated the creature's movements in a sacred dance; and the girls of Periclean Athens acted at that moment like the young men of the Mandans or Nootkas in their wolf-dance or buffalo-dance. Two questions remain unanswered: <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> goddess of the name of Artemis, and with her wide and beneficent functions, succeed to a cult so barbarous? or how, on the other hand, did the cult of a ravening she-bear develop into the humane and pure religion of Artemis? ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{the birds}} feed a mussel will {{sometimes}} close his shells hard on some careless duck's tongue or bill {{in such a}} way that he cannot be crushed or swallowed or broken against the rocks. In that case the bird, if he knows the secret, will fly to fresh water and drown his tormentor. Whether all the ducks have this wisdom, or whether it is confined to a few rare birds, there is no present means of knowing. I have seen three different eiders practice this bit of surgery myself, and have heard of at least a dozen more, all of the same species, that were seen in fresh ponds or rivers, dipping their heads under water repeatedly. In either case two interesting questions suggest themselves: first, <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> bird whose whole life from birth to death is spent on the sea first learn that certain mussels will drown in fresh water? and, second, How do the other birds know it now, when the need arises unexpectedly? ...|$|E

60|$|From {{my point}} of view, namely, that the higher and simple ideas {{may well be the}} earlier, I have, at least, offered a theory of the {{processes}} by which the lower attributes crystallised around a conception supposed (argumenti gratia) to be originally high. Other processes of degradation would come in, as (on my theory) the creed and practice of Animism, or worship of human ghosts, often of low character, swamped and invaded the prior belief in a fairly moral and beneficent, but not originally spiritual, Being. My theory, at least, is a theory, and, rightly or wrongly, accounts for the phenomenon, the combination of the highest divine and the lowest animal qualities in the same Being. But I have yet to learn how, if the lowest myths are the earliest, the highest attributes came in time to be conferred on the hero of the lowest myths. Why, or <b>how,</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> silly buffoon, or a confessed 'bogle' arrive at being regarded as a patron of such morality as had been evolved? An hypothesis of the processes involved must be indicated. It is not enough to reply, in general, that the rudimentary human mind is illogical and confused. That is granted; but {{there must have been a}} method in its madness. What that method was (from {{my point of}} view) I have shown, and it must be as easy for opponents to set forth what, from their point of view, the method was.|$|E
