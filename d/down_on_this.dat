5|$|Another issue arose when Cardinal Norman Gilroy {{presented}} Heffron in September 1962 with a {{plan for}} State aid to Catholic Church schools, including assistance for teacher salaries and capital grants for buildings, an issue that was highly explosive in the sectarian politics of New South Wales at the time. Heffron, alive {{to the need for}} a limited form of state support to placate sectarian conflict that could destroy the government, permitted Treasurer Jack Renshaw to include state support for school laboratories and a means-tested allowance to school students in the 1963 budget. Heffron later dropped the school laboratory provision but his permitting of the means-tested allowance provoked condemnation from the Federal Party Executive in Adelaide on 30 September 1962, who were less interested in placating the traditional Catholic hierarchy and more informed by the bitterness of the earlier ALP/DLP split in the party in 1955. Heffron and Renshaw backed <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> last provision, leaving no state aid for Catholic schools, and affirming the dominance of the Federal party in such matters.|$|E

500|$|Edwards' next {{efforts in}} {{smuggling}} involved a new partner, Christopher Dart, a lawyer from Natchez, Mississippi. In 1835 Dart invested $40,000 {{to buy the}} contracts of indentured blacks in Cuba and smuggle them into Texas as slaves. Instead providing money for the partnership, Edwards' contribution was land certificates. At the time, Texas was a Mexican border province. In 1829, Mexico had abolished slavery {{as well as the}} importation of slaves, but gave Texas an exemption from emancipating slaves who were already in the territory. [...] To circumvent the ban on importing slaves, traders instead reclassified them as indentured servants with 99-year contracts. The Mexican government cracked <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> practice in 1832, limiting terms of indenture to a maximum of 10 years. Edwards secured further financing from a New Orleans company named George Knight and Company and then went to Cuba where he purchased slaves.|$|E
500|$|López {{made the}} Red Sox' Opening Day roster in 2007, but after four {{scoreless}} outings he was optioned to Pawtucket on April 9 {{to make room}} for Mike Timlin, who had started the season on the disabled list. He was recalled on May 11 when Devern Hansack was sent <b>down.</b> <b>On</b> <b>this</b> stint, he posted a 3.18 ERA in 40 appearances before getting sent down on August 5 {{to make room for}} Curt Schilling, who was returning from the disabled list. With the Red Sox about to face several tough left-handed hitters in late August, Jon Lester was sent down on August 23 to make room for López on the roster. In 2007, López made 61 appearances, posting a 2–1 record with a 3.10 ERA in [...] innings. Despite his three stints in the minors, his 61 appearances ranked second on the club to Hideki Okajima's 66. He made 17 appearances for Pawtucket, going 2–1 with a 3.78 ERA. López {{was a member of the}} playoff roster for the Red Sox, posting a 15.43 ERA but winning his first World Series as the Red Sox swept the Rockies in four games.|$|E
500|$|A major {{opponent}} {{representing the}} popular factions {{in the province}} was Elisha Cooke, Jr., a politician and major landowner in Maine, which was then part of Massachusetts. [...] Cooke's opposition was rooted in disagreements on the currency, and the matter of logging in the Maine territory. [...] During the Dudley administration logging interests had widely flouted the 1711 White Pine Act, British Parliamentary legislation that reserved large trees on ungranted public lands for the government's use as ship masts. Shute sought to crack <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> behavior, earning the enmity of Cooke and others. [...] Cooke's early challenges to the law were legal in nature, but rapidly became political. [...] In 1718 Cooke was nominated {{to serve on the}} Governor's Council by the assembly, but Shute vetoed the choice. [...] The assembly then appointed Cooke to be its speaker in 1720. [...] This began a constitutional argument about the governor's powers, for Shute refused to accept Cooke's appointment, claiming it was within his authority to veto it. [...] The assembly, for its part, refused to appoint anyone else, and the following year seated a different speaker before Shute was given notice of his election.|$|E

500|$|Initially, Monzón was {{not willing}} to hand over power to Castillo Armas. The US State Department persuaded Óscar Osorio, the {{dictator}} of ElSalvador, to invite Monzón, Castillo Armas, and other significant individuals to participate in peace talks in San Salvador. Osorio agreed to do so, and after Díaz had been deposed, Monzón and Castillo Armas arrived in the Salvadoran capital on 30June. Castillo Armas wished to incorporate some of his rebel forces into the Guatemalan military; Monzón, however, was reluctant to allow this, leading to difficulties in the negotiations. Castillo Armas also saw Monzón as having been late to enter the fight against Árbenz. The negotiations nearly broke <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> issue on the very first day, and so Peurifoy, who had remained in Guatemala City {{to give the impression that}} the US was not heavily involved, traveled to San Salvador. Allen Dulles later said that Peurifoy's role was to [...] "crack some heads together". Peurifoy was able to force an agreement due to the fact that neither Monzón nor Castillo Armas was in a position to become or remain president without the support of the US. The deal was announced at 4:45am on 2July 1954, and under its terms, Castillo Armas and his subordinate, Major Enrique Trinidad Oliva, became members of the junta led by Monzón, although Monzón remained president. On 8July Castillo Armas replaced Monzón as president; Castillo Armas led a new five-person junta, of which Monzón remained a member. The settlement negotiated by Castillo Armas and Monzón also included a statement that the five-man junta would rule for fifteen days, during which a president would be chosen.|$|E
500|$|The Berle shows drew {{such high}} ratings that Presley was booked for a July 1 {{appearance}} on NBC's Steve Allen Show in New York. Allen, no fan {{of rock and}} roll, introduced a [...] "new Elvis" [...] in a white bow tie and black tails. Presley sang [...] "Hound Dog" [...] {{for less than a}} minute to a basset hound wearing a top hat and bow tie. As described by television historian Jake Austen, [...] "Allen thought Presley was talentless and absurd... set things up so that Presley would show his contrition". Allen, for his part, later wrote that he found Presley's [...] "strange, gangly, country-boy charisma, his hard-to-define cuteness, and his charming eccentricity intriguing" [...] and simply worked the singer into the customary [...] "comedy fabric" [...] of his program. Just before the final rehearsal for the show, Presley told a reporter, [...] "I'm holding <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> show. I don't want to do anything to make people dislike me. I think TV is important so I'm going to go along, but I won't be able to give the kind of show I do in a personal appearance." [...] Presley would refer back to the Allen show as the most ridiculous performance of his career. Later that night, he appeared on Hy Gardner Calling, a popular local TV show. Pressed on whether he had learned anything from the criticism to which he was being subjected, Presley responded, [...] "No, I haven't, I don't feel like I'm doing anything wrong.... I don't see how any type of music would have any bad influence on people when it's only music.... I mean, how would rock 'n' roll music make anyone rebel against their parents?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 1951, Wieman {{became the}} {{athletic}} director at the University of Denver. [...] While at Denver, Wieman was {{an active participant in}} the NCAA football rules committee. [...] In 1957, he led the effort to prohibit the practice of grabbing an opposing player's face mask and declaring it a personal foul penalty. [...] Wieman noted at the time: [...] "The use of the protective face mask is becoming quite general, and the practice of players grabbing opponents by the masks is also becoming all too common. [...] Such a procedure is not a part of football. [...] It can't be an accident and the feeling of the committee is to cut <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> type of thing before it leads to worse conditions." [...] Wieman retired from his position at the University of Denver in June 1962, after more than 40 years as a college athlete, coach and athletic administrator.|$|E

2500|$|The {{population}} of the Carib Reserve remained disconnected {{from the rest of}} Dominica, seldom seen and largely self-sustaining apart from some limited illegal trade with the neighboring French islands of Marie Galante and Martinique. [...] The colonial Administrator decided to crack <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> smuggling due to its impact on revenues, and in 1930, five armed policemen entered the Territory to seize smuggled goods and to arrest suspects. [...] When the police tried to seize a quantity of rum and tobacco and to take away suspects in Salybia, a crowd gathered in response and hurled stones and bottles. [...] The police fired into the crowd, injuring four, of whom two later died. [...] The police were beaten but managed to escape to Marigot, without having seized prisoners or contraband. [...] The Administrator responded by summoning the Royal Navy light cruiser HMS Delhi to the coast, which fired star shells into the air and displayed searchlights along the shore; the Caribs ran in fear from this display of force and hid in the woods. [...] Marines landed to aid local police in the search for the perpetrators of the disturbance. [...] Accurate news of the incident was difficult to come by, and rumors instead spread throughout the island of a Carib uprising. The Times incorrectly reported that Caribs had looted and rioted in the capital, Roseau. [...] The incident is still hyperbolically known as [...] "The Carib War." ...|$|E
2500|$|The , [...] lane is bordered {{along its}} length by semicylindrical {{channels}} called [...] "gutters", which {{are designed to}} collect errant balls. The overall width of the lane including the channels is [...] [...] The narrow lane prevents bowling a straight line at the angle required to consistently carry (knock down) all ten pins for a strike. Most skillful bowlers will roll a side spinning (hook shape reaction) ball to overcome this. A foul line is marked at the seam of {{the start of the}} lane and end of the approach. If any part of a bowler's body touches the line itself or beyond (anywhere on the actual lane surface or any adjoining areas including walls and other lanes) after the ball is delivered, the bowl is a foul and any pins knocked over by that delivery are scored as zero (0). The bowler is allowed one shot at a new rack of ten pins if s/he fouled on the first roll of a frame, and if all ten pins are knocked <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> shot, it is scored as a spare. Behind the foul line is an [...] "approach" [...] approximately [...] long used to gain speed and leverage on the ball before delivering it. [...] from the foul line, where the lane terminates, it is joined to a roughly [...] deep by [...] wide surface of durable and impact-resistant material called the [...] "pin deck", upon which each rack of pins is set.|$|E
2500|$|Similar {{to one of}} {{the most}} {{enduring}} myths about LSD, and also somewhat related to the [...] "multi-day impairment" [...] legend described further <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> list, this legend claims that residual THC stored in fat cells gets released spontaneously into the bloodstream in enough quantities to get one high again long after the last use of cannabis, be it days, weeks, or even months later. [...] This legend is typically accompanied by anecdotal evidence of people who experience a [...] "high" [...] after doing exercise of some sort. While somewhat more biologically plausible than the discredited LSD legend due to the fat-solubility of THC, this phenomenon remains scientifically unproven. [...] A 2009 study of rats that involved injecting them with large quantities of THC (equivalent to 5-10 joints per day in humans) each day for ten days straight, then subjecting them to simulated severe stress or food deprivation led to double the blood levels of THC-COOH two days after the last THC exposure compared to rats that were neither stressed nor deprived of food. If such results occurred in humans, then it is theoretically possible for a chronic cannabis user to fail a drug test long after the usual detection time due to exercise, dieting, or severe stress shortly before the test—and several anecdotal reports of this exist. [...] However, there is currently no hard evidence that enough active THC would be released to get one [...] "high" [...] or cause [...] "flashbacks." [...] One should also note that flashbacks from psychoactive drugs in general are now known to be psychological phenomena, and drug residues typically play no significant role in their occurrence and recurrence.|$|E
