5|$|Major General Mohammed Fawzi, who was Sadek's {{predecessor}} {{as defense}} minister, regularly held command simulations. These exercises had unrealistic objectives and operational aims that were considerably outside {{the capabilities of}} the Egyptian military. When Lieutenant General Saad El Shazly became Chief of Staff on 16 May 1971, no offensive plans yet existed. Rather, there was a defensive plan code named Operation 200, and a more aggressive alternative named Operation Granite. Although Granite incorporated raids and assaults into the Sinai, it was essentially defensive. In <b>his</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the military's capabilities, he concluded the air force was the weakest arm. It was outmatched by its Israeli counterpart in various aspects, and Israeli pilots were also more experienced. A pivotal equipment advantage for the IAF was the F-4 Phantom II, a third generation fighter/bomber. By the outbreak of the war in October 1973, the IDF had 122 F-4E and 6 RF-4Es (R denotes the reconnaissance variant) in service.|$|E
5|$|While {{working in}} the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo's {{interest}} in archaeology and old relics led him to reconstruct an armillary sphere from existing models {{as well as from}} ancient texts that could provide additional information. Shen used ancient mirrors while conducting his optics experiments. He observed ancient weaponry, describing the scaled sight devices on ancient crossbows and the ancients' production of swords with composite blades that had a midrib of wrought iron and low-carbon steel while having two sharp edges of high-carbon steel. Being a knowledgeable musician, Shen also suggested suspending an ancient bell by using a hollow handle. In <b>his</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the carved reliefs of the ancient Zhuwei Tomb, Shen stated that the reliefs demonstrate genuine Han Dynasty (202 BC–220 AD) era clothing.|$|E

He used Raven's Progressive Matrices and interviewed candidates and then rated {{them on the}} same four-point scale that the OCTU used. <b>His</b> <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> the candidates matched with those of commanding officers in 34 out of 36 cases and were deemed a success at picking out capable officers.|$|R

50|$|The {{formation}} of this panel apparently worried Teller, who suspected {{they would not}} agree with <b>his</b> <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> Excalibur's viability. In response, he stepped up his fundraising efforts, spending a considerable time in 1982 in Washington lobbying for a Manhattan Project-level effort to bring the system to production as soon as possible.

25|$|So in 1910 BSA {{purchased}} Daimler with BSA shares but Docker who {{negotiated the}} arrangements either ignored or failed in <b>his</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> their {{consequences for the}} new combine. The combine was never adequately balanced or co-ordinated. One of the financial provisions obliged Daimler to pay BSA an annual dividend of £100,000 representing approximately 40 per cent of the actual cash BSA had put into Daimler. This financial burden deprived Daimler of badly needed cash to fund development, forcing the Daimler company to borrow money from the Midland Bank.|$|E
25|$|Paul Langevin and von Laue {{showed that}} the twin paradox can be {{completely}} resolved by consideration of acceleration in special relativity. If two twins move away from each other, {{and one of them}} is accelerating and coming back to the other, then the accelerated twin is younger than the other one, since he was located in at least two inertial frames of reference, and therefore <b>his</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> which events are simultaneous changed during the acceleration. For the other twin nothing changes since he remained in a single frame.|$|E

25|$|Seam bowling is the act {{of using}} the seam of the ball to cause the ball to bounce in an {{unpredictable}} fashion when it hits the pitch. A good batsman {{will be able to}} predict where a ball is going to bounce and from that work out what height the ball will be when it reaches him or her. By generating variations in bounce, the bowler can make it more likely the batsman will make a mistake in <b>his</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the ball and give away their wicket.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of its completion, the building's {{architectural}} style was described as Renaissance Revival. The Plain Dealer architectural critic Angela Chatman agreed with that assessment in 1989, as did The Plain Dealer architecture critic Steven Litt in 2006, historian Sharon Gregor in 2010, and Crain's Cleveland Business magazine in 2015. However, in 1991 historian Jan Cigliano Hartman called the building a mix of Beaux-Arts, Neoclassical, and Renaissance Revival styles. Architect Marcel Breuer described it in 1967 as Neoclassical, and Litt described it as such in 1997. But architect Carl J. Stein said in 2010 that it was more properly Beaux-Arts. Litt changed <b>his</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the structure's style to Beaux-Arts as well in 2013.|$|E
25|$|In 1790, Stewart {{was elected}} as a Member of the Irish Parliament for Down {{in one of}} the most {{expensive}} elections in Irish history. Though for a time he was associated with the Northern Whig Club, he entered the Irish House of Commons as an Independent. He ran on a platform supporting Whig principles of electoral reform and opposing the Irish policies of the British Government. But even from the outset of his career, he was a personal supporter of the Prime Minister, William Pitt. Stewart was a lifelong advocate of Catholic concessions, though his position on the specific issue of Catholic Emancipation varied depending on <b>his</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the potential repercussions on other policy priorities.|$|E

He holds his own compared with the late Syed who created waves more often by being controversial. Not that Siddiqui is non-controversial. <b>His</b> <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> Sir Syed Ahmad Khan and Allama Iqbal have been heretical but have escaped attention because his scholarship is unassailable and we generally don't like reading controversial things if they are deeply scholarly.

25|$|While in {{the short}} term the fiasco led Bill Cosby to end his {{advertising}} for Coke, saying his commercials that praised the superiority of the new formula had hurt his credibility, no one at Coca-Cola was fired or otherwise held responsible for what is still widely perceived as a misstep, {{for the simple reason that}} it ultimately wasn't. When Goizueta died in 1997, the company's share price was at a level well above what it was when he had taken over 16 years earlier and its position as market leader even more firmly established. At the time Roger Enrico, then head of Pepsi's American operations, likened New Coke to the Edsel. Later, when he became PepsiCo's CEO, he modified <b>his</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the situation, saying that had people been fired or demoted over New Coke, it would have sent a message that risk-taking was strongly discouraged at the company.|$|E
25|$|Dudley Docker {{had joined}} the board in 1906 and was {{appointed}} deputy chairman of BSA in 1909. He had made a spectacular financial success of a merger of five large rolling-stock companies in 1902 and become {{the leader of the}} period's merger movement. Believing he could buy the missing management skills that could not be found within BSA, he started merger talks with The Daimler Company Limited of Coventry. Daimler and Rover were then the largest British car producers. Daimler was immensely profitable. After its capital reconstruction in 1904, Daimler's profits were 57% and 150% returns on invested capital in 1905 and 1906. The attraction for Daimler shareholders, was the apparent stability of BSA. So, in 1910, BSA purchased Daimler with BSA shares, but Docker, who negotiated the arrangements, either ignored or failed in <b>his</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> their consequences for the new combine. The combine was never adequately balanced or co-ordinated.|$|E
