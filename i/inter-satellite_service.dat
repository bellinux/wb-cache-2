5000|$|<b>Inter-satellite</b> <b>service</b> [...] (also: inter-satellite {{radiocommunication}} service) is - {{according to}} Article 1.22 of the International Telecommunication Union´s (ITU) Radio Regulations (RR) - defined as «A radiocommunication service providing links between artificial satellites.» ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the sharing and {{compatibility}} studies of International Mobile Telecommunications 2020 (IMT- 2020) and <b>inter-satellite</b> <b>service</b> (ISS) in 26 GHz frequency band, which was selected by International Telecommunications Union (ITU) {{as one of the}} most promising candidate frequency bands for 5 G. Based on relevant ITU recommendations and reports, and current technical characteristics of both systems, a methodology is developed for the interference coexistence analysis between them. The spatial and temporal distribution analysis is proposed and the calculation of IMT- 2020 aggregate interference takes the actual urban population into consideration. The results show that these two systems have considerable possibilities in coexistence in 26 GHz frequency band...|$|E
40|$|In early 2000, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) {{commenced}} the Ka-Band Transition Project (KaTP) {{as another}} step towards satisfying wideband communication {{requirements of the}} space research and earth exploration-satellite services. The KaTP team upgraded the ground segment portion of NASA's Space Network (SN) in order to enable high data rate space science and earth science services communications. The SN ground segment {{is located at the}} White Sands Complex (WSC) in New Mexico. NASA conducted the SN ground segment upgrades in conjunction with space segment upgrades implemented via the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS) -HIJ project. The three new geostationary data relay satellites developed under the TDRS-HIJ project support the use of the <b>inter-satellite</b> <b>service</b> (ISS) allocation in the 25. 25 - 27. 5 GHz band (the 26 GHz band) to receive high speed data from low earth-orbiting customer spacecraft. The TDRS H spacecraft (designated TDRS- 8) is currently operational at a 171 degrees west longitude. TDRS I and J spacecraft on-orbit testing has been completed. These spacecraft support 650 MHz-wide Ka-band telemetry links that are referred to as return links. The 650 MHz-wide Ka-band telemetry links have the capability to support data rates up to at least 1. 2 Gbps. Therefore, the TDRS-HIJ spacecraft will significantly enhance the existing data rate elements of the NASA Space Network that operate at S-band and Ku-band...|$|E
