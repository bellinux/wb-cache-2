It is not clear to what extent this is being done. This study aimed to determine to what extent complex interventions are tested prior to a <b>full-scale</b> <b>trial</b> and whether more or different testing would {{have led to a}} different intervention being used in the trial. Methods Email survey of the authors of complex intervention trials published in seven major journals in 2004. Results 72 % (50 / 69) of eligible authors replied. Eight authors did not consider their interventions to be complex. The majority of respondents' complex interventions were tested (34 / 42) : some extensively. Conversely, only 17 of the 34 published reports describing these trials mention testing. Two-thirds (22 / 34) of those testing their interventions did not believe that more or different testing would have produced a more effective intervention. 31 % (13 / 42) of all authors did believe further testing would have led to improvements. Five respondents mentioned a lack of funding as a reason for not doing more testing. Conclusion Complex interventions are generally tested prior to their evaluation in a <b>full-scale</b> <b>trial,</b> although the amount of testing varies. Testing is often not described in trial reports, which makes it hard to judge whether a trial result could be improved with a better intervention, or whether further work with a different intervention is required. </p...|$|R

This demonstrated that a bomb of sufficient size could be carried by an Avro Lancaster rather than waiting for a larger bomber such as the Windsor to be built.

Sir Arthur Harris, head of RAF Bomber Command from a briefing by Linnell also opposed the allocation of his bombers. Wallis had, however, written to an influential intelligence officer, Group Captain Frederick Winterbotham. Winterbotham ensured that the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Charles Portal heard of the project. Portal saw the film of the Chesil Beach trials and was convinced. Overriding Harris, Portal ordered on 26 February 1943 that thirty Lancasters were to be allocated to the mission and the target date was set for May, when water levels would be at their highest and breaches in the dams would cause the most damage.

5000|$|The hull {{below the}} waterline, {{along the main}} armour belt, formed the Side Protection System (SPS). It was {{subdivided}} {{into a series of}} longitudinal compartments in a void-liquid-void layout; the outer and inner were filled with air, and the middle compartment with liquid (fuel or water). The outer hull plating in the region of the SPS was thin to reduce potential splinter damage from a torpedo. The outer compartment of the SPS was normally an empty or void space (containing only air) and this allowed the initial explosion from a torpedo to expand while minimizing damage to the ship. The centre compartment was filled with oil or seawater and this spread the pressure pulse over a larger area while the liquid contained any metal splinters that were created from the torpedo explosion. The inboard compartment was another void space and served to contain any liquid leaking from the liquid layer and any remaining pressure pulse from the torpedo explosion. Inboard of the final void space was an armoured bulkhead which varied in thickness from 1.5 in (37 mm) over the machinery spaces to 1.75 inch (44 mm) abreast of the magazines. This bulkhead formed the [...] "holding bulkhead" [...] and it was designed to resist the residual blast effects from the torpedo hit. If this final inner bulkhead was penetrated a further set of subdivided compartments would contain any leaks; inboard of the holding bulkhead the ship was highly subdivided into small compartments containing auxiliary machinery spaces.The SPS void-liquid-void layer was generally about 13 feet wide, and the auxiliary machinery spaces added approximately another 8 feet of space from the outer hull plating to the major machinery spaces. The only exception to this was abreast A and B Engine Rooms, where the auxiliary machinery spaces were omitted, but another void space, about three feet wide was substituted in its place.Above the SPS, and directly behind the armour belt, was a series of compartments, typically used for washrooms or storage spaces, which were designed to allow for upward venting of overpressure from a torpedo hit. This scheme was designed to protect against a 1000 lb warhead, and had been tested and found effective in <b>full-scale</b> <b>trials.</b> The SPS was also a key component of the ship's damage control system, as lists resulting from flooding could be corrected by counterflooding empty void spaces, and/or draining normally liquid filled compartments. In the case of the loss of the Prince of Wales these spaces were used for counterflooding to reduce list.|$|E
