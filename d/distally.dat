5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1967, Favaloro began {{to consider the possibility}} of using the saphenous vein in coronary surgery. He put his ideas into practice {{for the first time in}} May of that year. The basic principle was to bypass a diseased (obstructed) segment in a coronary artery in order to deliver blood flow <b>distally.</b> The standardization of this technique, called bypass or transmyocardial revascularization surgery, was the fundamental work of his career, and ensured that his prestige would transcend the limits of his country, as the procedure radically changed the treatment of coronary disease. In 1970 he published one of his best-known volumes, Surgical Treatment of Coronary Arteriosclerosis.|$|E
5|$|Surrounding {{the floral}} tube and corona and reflexed (bent back) {{from the rest}} of the {{perianth}} are the six spreading tepals or floral leaves, in two whorls which may be <b>distally</b> ascending, reflexed (folded back), or lanceolate. Like many monocotyledons, the perianth is homochlamydeous, that is undifferentiated into separate calyx (sepals) and corolla (petals), but rather has six tepals. The three outer tepal segments may be considered sepals, and the three inner segments petals. The transition point between the floral tube and the corona is marked by the insertion of the free tepals on the fused perianth.|$|E
5|$|Thoratic scutes on struthiosaurines are oval to {{teardrop}} shaped, and possess sharp ridges {{that rise}} <b>distally.</b> Some scutes {{were long and}} had small domes on them. The first primary osteoderms on the pelvis are large, compressed from the sides, and have a sharp, short point. S. sp. was preserved with five fragmentary scutes from the pelvis. One fragment includes two small scutes with a ridge down the middle, joining the two together, and a compressed osteoderm with a small spike. It is thought that the fragment was {{from the edge of}} the pelvic region. Another fragment includes two oval osteoderms with small ossicles fused between them. Pelvic shields were probably formed on struthiosaurines by these scutes.|$|E
5|$|The eight {{arms are}} thick, {{tapering}} {{to a narrow}} point. They are unequal in length, with arm pair I the shortest, followed by arm pair II and arm pair IV, and arm pair III the longest. All of them possess two rows of suckers. Each sucker has a diameter less than , decreasing <b>distally,</b> and a ring of 17 to 28 sharp acute teeth. The left arm of pair IV in males is modified into a sexual organ known as the hectocotylus. They bear long fleshy protrusions (papillae) with toothless suckers at the distal portion. The tentacles are thick and long, extending {{the length of the}} mantle when retracted. They are slightly compressed laterally. A prominent ridge (a keel) is present on the outer surface of each of the tentacle clubs (the wide tip of the tentacles). There are four rows of suckers on the manus (proximal part of the club) and the dactylus (distal part of the club). The larger suckers in the centre of the manus have 17 to 18 widely spaced teeth.|$|E
5|$|The holotype {{specimen}} of A. atacis {{is a group}} of three connected dorsal vertebrae. Cervical vertebrae are uncommon from Bellevue {{and most of them are}} poorly preserved. The vertebrae are opisthocoelous, with centra that lengthen toward the rear. Neural spines have been preserved on the vertebrae, and they face toward the rear. Two dorsal vertebrae were preserved with a complete, but very crushed neural arch, a neural spine with a characteristic shape: it is very widened <b>distally</b> and narrows downwards. The vertebrae also have an internal structure that is spongy, with very large cells. The caudal vertebrae are all strongly procoelous and are compressed on the sides. The neural spines of the caudal vertebrae are very narrow and very tall and point toward the rear. The middle caudal vertebrae are more compressed on the sides that the others. Also, the centrum of middle caudal vertebrae is longer proportionally. Two sacral vertebrae were known from Bellevue. They are poorly preserved, and are thought to belong to a juvenile. A complete sacrum was also found in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The third {{axillary}} sclerite (3Ax) lies in {{the posterior}} part of the articular region of the wing. Its form is highly variable and often irregular, but the third axillary is the sclerite on which is inserted the flexor muscle of the wing (D). Mesally it articulates anteriorly (f) with the posterior {{end of the second}} axillary, and posteriorly (b) with the posterior wing process of the tergum (PNP), or with a small fourth axillary when the latter is present. <b>Distally</b> the third axillary is prolonged in a process which is always associated with the bases of the group of veins in the anal region of the wing here termed the vannal veins (V). The third axillary, therefore, is usually the posterior hinge plate of the wing base and is the active sclerite of the flexor mechanism, which directly manipulates the vannal veins. The contraction of the flexor muscle (D) revolves the third axillary on its mesal articulations (b, f) and thereby lifts its distal arm; this movement produces the flexion of the wing. The Fourth Axillary sclerite is not a constant element of the wing base. When present it is usually a small plate intervening between the third axillary and the posterior notal wing process and is probably a detached piece of the latter.|$|E
5|$|Postcubitus (Pcu) is {{the first}} anal of the Comstock–Needham system. The postcubitus, however, has the status of an {{independent}} wing vein and should be recognized as such. In nymphal wings, its trachea arises between the cubital trachea and the group of vannal tracheae. In the mature wings of more generalized insect the Postcubitus is always associated proximally with the cubitus and is never intimately connected with the flexor sclerite (3Ax) of the wing base. In Neuroptera, Mecoptera, and Trichoptera the postcubitus may be more {{closely associated with the}} vannal veins, but its base is always free from the latter. The postcubitus is usually unbranched; it is primitively two branched. The vannal veins (lV to nV) are the anal veins that are immediately associated with the third axillary, and which are directly affected by the movement of this sclerite that brings about the flexion of the wings. In number the vannal veins vary. from 1 to 12, according to the expansion of the vannal area of the wing. The vannal tracheae usually arise from a common tracheal stem in nymphal insects, and the veins are regarded as branches of a single anal vein. <b>Distally</b> the vannal veins are either simple or branched. Jugal Veins (J) of the jugal lobe of the wing is often occupied by a network of irregular veins, or it may be entirely membranous; but sometimes it contains one or two distinct small veins, the first jugal vein, or vena arcuata, and the second jugal vein, or vena cardinalis (2J).|$|E
5|$|The innominate {{is known}} from seven examples, {{but most are}} quite incomplete. It {{includes}} a narrow ilium and long ischium. The ischial tuberosity, a narrow rough piece of bone in most placentals, is broad and smooth in Plesiorycteropus. With 17 specimens, the femur is the best represented long bone. It is distinctive in its long neck, similar only to the gymnure Echinosorex according to MacPhee. A projection known as the third trochanter is larger in P.madagascariensis. The tibia and fibula are extensively fused into a tibiofibula, of which eight examples are known. This bone resembles that of armadillos in the extensive fusion, the compression of the shaft of the tibia, the narrowness of the articulation surface at the distal end, and the broad space between the bones. Unlike in armadillos, the tibia and fibula are not inclined relative to each other, but about parallel. The astragalus, which is known from four examples, is wide and short and contains a uniquely large posteromedial process. Seven metapodials (middle hand or foot bones) are known, rather variable in size, but MacPhee was unable to separate metacarpals (from the hand) and metatarsals (from the foot). All are rather short and are broad proximally and narrow <b>distally.</b> Among the few known phalanges, the proximal phalange is shorter than the middle one and the distal phalanges are narrow and clawlike.|$|E
25|$|Type III – {{originates}} in the descending aorta and rarely extends proximally, but will extend <b>distally.</b> It most often occurs in elderly patients with atherosclerosis and hypertension.|$|E
25|$|This {{also leads}} to a very small petiole and to the gaster being pointed downward. The anal pore then open ventrally (toward the abdomen) instead of <b>distally.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{regions of}} the hip are all located in the thigh: anteriorly, the sub{{inguinal}} region is bounded by the inguinal ligament, the sartorius, and the pectineus and forms part of the femoral triangle which extends <b>distally</b> to the adductor longus. Posteriorly, the gluteal region corresponds to the gluteus maximus. The anterior region of the thigh extends <b>distally</b> from the femoral triangle to {{the region of the}} knee and laterally to the tensor fasciae latae. The posterior region ends <b>distally</b> before the popliteal fossa. The anterior and posterior {{regions of the}} knee extend from the proximal regions down {{to the level of the}} tuberosity of the tibia. In the lower leg the anterior and posterior regions extend down to the malleoli. Behind the malleoli are the lateral and medial retromalleolar regions and behind these is the region of the heel. Finally, the foot is subdivided into a dorsal region superiorly and a plantar region inferiorly.|$|E
25|$|Capitulum: Length 0.51- 0.65mm in width, surface punctate; {{posterior}} margin straight; no cornua; posterolateal margins slightly divergent anteriorly; basis ventrally narrowing to {{the straight}} posterior margin, {{surface with a}} short anterolateral ridge. Palps short and broad; article 1 rounded and a little salient laterally, ventrally with a transverse rounded flange continuous with ridge on basis; articles 2 and 3 with no apparent suture, 0.33- 0.40mm in length, almost {{twice as long as}} broad, rounded <b>distally,</b> hairs moderate in number, some long hairs ventrally. Hypostome short and broad, 0.25- 0.28mm in length, narrowing and shallowly rounded distally; dentition 2/2 of large rounded teeth, some small teeth <b>distally</b> and crenulations basally.|$|E
25|$|Capitulum: Length 0.40- 0.43mm. Basis dorsally 0.23- 0.25mm in width; {{posterior}} margin straight; posterolateral angles not salient; auriculae well defined. Palps as in female; articles 2 and 3 0.30- 0.32mm in length. Hypostome lanceolate and bluntly pointed; dentition 2/2, 3/3 <b>distally.</b>|$|E
25|$|The clinoid segment, or C5, {{is another}} short {{segment of the}} {{internal}} carotid that begins after the artery exits the cavernous sinus at the proximal dural ring and extends <b>distally</b> to the distal dural ring, after which the carotid artery is considered 'intra-dural' and has entered the subarachnoid space.|$|E
25|$|A hydrosalpinx is a <b>distally</b> blocked {{fallopian tube}} filled with serous or clear fluid. The blocked tube may become {{substantially}} distended giving the tube a characteristic sausage-like or retort-like shape. The condition is often bilateral and the affected tubes may reach several centimeters in diameter. The blocked tubes cause infertility.|$|E
25|$|The {{skeleton}} of the thumb {{consists of the}} first metacarpal bone which articulates proximally with the carpus at the carpometacarpal joint and <b>distally</b> with the proximal phalanx at the metacarpophalangeal joint. This latter bone articulates with the distal phalanx at the interphalangeal joint. Additionally, there are two sesamoid bones at the metacarpophalangeal joint.|$|E
25|$|Both heads join on {{the middle}} of the humerus, to form a single muscle mass usually near the {{insertion}} of the deltoid, to form a common muscle belly. <b>Distally,</b> biceps ends in two tendons: the stronger attaches to the radial tuberosity on the radius, while the other, the bicipital aponeurosis, radiates into the ulnar part of the antebrachial fascia.|$|E
25|$|Forficula auricularia has an {{elongated}} flattened brownish colored body, with a shield-shaped pronotum, {{two pairs of}} wings {{and a pair of}} forcep-like cerci. They are about 12–15mm long. The second tarsal segment is lobed, extending <b>distally</b> below the third tarsal segment. The antenna consists of 11–14 segments, and the mouth parts are of the chewing type.|$|E
25|$|Two muscles lie {{underneath}} the biceps brachii. These are the coracobrachialis muscle, which like the biceps {{attaches to the}} coracoid process of the scapula, and the brachialis muscle which connects to the ulna and along the mid-shaft of the humerus. Besides those, the brachioradialis muscle is adjacent to the biceps and also inserts on the radius bone, though more <b>distally.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{all cases}} these {{alteration}} zones are metasomatism {{effects in the}} strictest sense, resulting in addition of potassium, silica, magnesium, and depletion of sodium. Chlorite minerals are usually more magnesian in composition within the footwall alteration zone of a VMS deposit than equivalent rocks within the same formation <b>distally.</b> The hangingwall to a VMS deposit is often weakly sodium depleted.|$|E
25|$|Tourniquet cuffs can be {{cylindrical}} or contour in shape. Cylindrical tourniquet cuffs {{are designed}} to fit optimally on cylindrically shaped limbs. However, human limbs may be conically-shaped (i.e. tapered), particularly in extremely muscular or obese individuals. Applying a cylindrical cuff on a tapered limb can result in poor fit, sliding of the cuff <b>distally</b> on the limb during the procedure, and inability to achieve a bloodless field at normal pressures.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypopharynx}} is {{a median}} lobe immediately behind the mouth, projecting forwards {{from the back}} of the preoral cavity; it is a lobe of uncertain origin, but perhaps associated with the mandibular segment; in apterygotes, earwigs, and nymphal mayflies, the hypopharynx bears a pair of lateral lobes, the superlinguae (singular: superlingua). It divides the cavity into a dorsal food pouch, or cibarium, and a ventral salivarium into which the salivary duct opens. It is commonly found fused to the libium. Most of the hypopharynx is membranous, but the adoral face is sclerotized <b>distally,</b> and proximally contains a pair of suspensory sclerites extending upwards to end in the lateral wall of the stomodeum. Muscles arising on the frons are inserted into these sclerites, which <b>distally</b> are hinged to a pair of lingual sclerites. These, in turn, have inserted into them antagonistic pairs of muscles arising on the tentorium and labium. The various muscles serve to swing the hypopharynx forwards and back, and in the cockroach, two more muscles run across the hypopharynx and dilate the salivary orifice and expand the salivarium.|$|E
25|$|For Banks, rhyniophytes {{comprised}} simple leafless {{plants with}} terminal sporangia (e.g., Cooksonia, Rhynia) with centrarch xylem; zosterophylls comprised plants with lateral sporangia that split <b>distally</b> (away from their attachment) to release their spores, and had exarch strands of xylem (e.g., Gosslingia). Trimerophytes comprised plants with large clusters of downwards curving terminal sporangia that split along their length to release their spores and had centrarch xylem strands (e.g., Psilophyton).|$|E
25|$|The nests {{created by}} P. snelleni are made vertically. They {{typically}} {{consist of a}} single comb. The comb is fan-shaped and the pedicel {{is attached to the}} basal cell. This set up allows new cells to be added <b>distally.</b> The founding queen uses twigs or the surface of rock overhangs as horizontal supports for the nest. The nest petioles (stem) are perpendicular to these supports. These wasps occupy a vertical zone of 200–400 meters.|$|E
25|$|For most of {{the past}} century {{patients}} with tubal infertility due to hydrosalpinx underwent tubal corrective surgery to open up the <b>distally</b> occluded end of the tubes (salpingostomy) and remove adhesions (adhesiolysis). Unfortunately, pregnancy rates tended to be low as the infection process often had permanently damaged the tubes, and in many cases hydrosalpinges and adhesions formed again. Further, ectopic pregnancy is a typical complication. Surgical interventions can be done by laparotomy or laparoscopy.|$|E
25|$|The {{brachial plexus}} is {{formed by the}} ventral rami of C5-C6-C7-C8-T1, {{occasionally}} with small contributions by C4 and T2. There are multiple approaches to blockade of the brachial plexus, beginning proximally with the interscalene block and continuing <b>distally</b> with the supraclavicular, infraclavicular, and axillary blocks. The concept behind all of these approaches to the brachial plexus is {{the existence of a}} sheath encompassing the neurovascular bundle extending from the deep cervical fascia to slightly beyond the borders of the axilla.|$|E
25|$|Contour cuffs have an arc-shaped design that, when {{wrapped around}} a limb, gives them a smaller {{diameter}} <b>distally</b> than proximally. Contour cuffs enhance comfort in patients with tapered limbs and {{reduce the risk of}} mechanical shearing. It has been reported that contour tourniquet cuffs occlude blood flow at lower inflation pressures than standard rectangular cuffs of equal width, which may be attributable to better cuff fit and more efficient transmission of pressure to deep tissues. There are two types of contour cuff designs; fixed-contour and variable-contour.|$|E
25|$|Post-cranial {{characteristics}} include reduced relative {{size of the}} pubic peduncle of the ilium and {{a fourth}} trochanter that is shifted <b>distally</b> on the shaft of the femur. The pubic peduncle of the ilium is an anterior extension of the ilium, which joins with the pubis. In Genasauria, the relative size of the public peduncle, compared {{to the size of}} the ilium, is reduced. The fourth trochanter is a process (extension) of the femur that serves as an attachment point for tail muscles, mainly for attachment of the Musculus caudofemoralis longus.|$|E
25|$|Ovary {{is small}} (0.75 whorl), {{composed}} of simple, stalked lobes. It is slightly overlapping stomach anteriorly. Female glandular oviduct and associated structures are as follows: Coiled oviduct is narrow, vertical. Bursa copulatrix is small, ovate, horizontal, about 50% overlapped by albumen gland. Bursal duct {{is longer than}} bursa, narrow, opening from distal edge, partly embedded in albumen gland proximally, entirely embedded <b>distally,</b> junction with common duct well in front of posterior wall of pallial cavity. Seminal receptacle is small, pouch-like, positioned near ventral edge of albumen gland slightly anterior to bursa copulatrix. Albumen gland is largely visceral. Capsule gland composed of two distinct tissue sections. Genital aperture a terminal slit.|$|E
25|$|Recent radiologic appraisals of the {{mesenteric}} organ {{have been}} conducted {{in the context of}} the contemporary understanding of mesenteric organ anatomy. When this organ is divided into non-flexural and flexural regions, these can readily be differentiated in most patients on CT imaging. Clarification of the radiological appearance of the human mesentery resonates with the suggestions of Dodd and enables a clearer conceptualization of mesenteric derangements in disease states. This is of immediate relevance in the spread of cancer from colon cancer and perforated diverticular disease, and in pancreatitis where fluid collections in the lesser sac dissect the mesocolon from the retroperitoneum and thereby extend <b>distally</b> within the latter.|$|E
25|$|The wasps {{within the}} Vespidae family exhibit {{a wide range}} of body sizes, and S. septentrionalis is one of the larger wasps within the family. As a result, they are able to {{generate}} a lift force that is able to maintain flight in the presence of their large muscle mass. In order for this to occur in the most efficient manner possible, these wasps have enlarged wings and veins that are <b>distally</b> extended. The elongated wings will allow for flying that is more energetically efficient, in order to compensate for their large body size and muscle mass, while the distally-organized veins will prevent bending of the wings, which would result in a loss of energy.|$|E
25|$|On {{the lower}} {{abdominal}} skin, a slight skin slit {{was made to}} allow the future urethra to be passed through upon inversion of the neovaginal lining. A Foley catheter was inserted and the urethra was sutured onto the catheter, about 5cm <b>distally</b> from its passage through the skin. No skin suture {{was used in the}} urethral meatus, and some kind of scar contraction was always foreseen. Two sutures were bilaterally passed through the perianal skin and the levator ani muscles and served to tightly and firmly support an obstetric stent, placed in the neovagina to provide support for the inverted skin flap. A drain was left in the posterior commissure and, finally, excess scrotal skin was resected to obtain a good appearance of the major labia.|$|E
25|$|Interposed {{between the}} hepatic and splenic flexures, the greater omentum adheres to the {{transverse}} colon along a further band or fold of peritoneum. Dissection through this allows {{access to the}} cephalad (top) surface of the transverse mesocolon. Focal adhesions frequently tether the greater omentum to the cephalad aspect of the transverse mesocolon. The left colon {{is associated with a}} similar anatomic configuration of peritoneal folds; the splenic peritoneal fold is contiguous with the left lateral paracolic peritoneal fold at the splenic flexure. Division of the latter similarly allows for the separation of the left colon and associated mesentery off the underlying fascia and frees it from the retroperitoneum. The left lateral paracolic peritoneal fold continues <b>distally</b> at the lateral aspect of the mobile component of the mesosigmoid.|$|E
25|$|The {{benefits}} of settling basally are significant, with basal stem mothers producing 49-65% more offspring than their <b>distally</b> settled counterparts. The {{benefits of}} settling basally {{relate to the}} aphid's ability to manipulate the plant's food resources. The galls formed by sugarbeet root aphids act as physiologic sinks, diverting and intercepting the plant's normal transport of resources and nutrients. 14C labeling experiments have shown that their galls intercept resources being transported from the midvein to the distal parts of the leaf. In addition, these galls are able to divert 14C from neighboring leaves. One study showed that, on average, 29% of the 14C accumulating inside a basal gall was supplied by a neighboring leaf and not the leaf the gall itself was on. In contrast, neighboring leaves only supplied 7% of a distal gall's 14C, illustrating the importance of settling basally.|$|E
25|$|The lower {{mandible}} {{is supported by}} a bone known as the inferior maxillary bone—a compound bone composed of two distinct ossified pieces. These ossified plates (or rami), which can be U-shaped or V-shaped, join <b>distally</b> (the exact location of the joint depends on the species) but are separated proximally, attaching {{on either side of the}} head to the quadrate bone. The jaw muscles, which allow the bird to close its beak, attach to the proximal end of the {{lower mandible}} and to the bird's skull. The muscles that depress the lower mandible are usually weak, except in a few birds such as the starlings and the extinct Huia, which have well-developed digastric muscles that aid in foraging by prying or gaping actions. In most birds, these muscles are relatively small as compared to the jaw muscles of similarly sized mammals.|$|E
25|$|Capitulum: Length 1.00- 1.035mm. Basis dorsally 0.60- 0.68mm in width, {{the lateral}} submarginal fields swollen and {{frequently}} delimited from the depressed, median field by ill-defined carinae; posterior margin sinuous, posterolateral angles swollen, sometimes mildly salient; porose areas large, deep subcircular or oval, the longer axis directed anteriorly, interval frequently depressed, at {{most about the}} width of one; basis ventrally with posterior margin rounded and with well-defined, blunt, retrograde auriculae. Palps long and slender, some long hairs ventrally; article I rounded and somewhat salient laterally, inner 'ring' with dorsal tongue-like prolongation and ventrally semicircular and plate-like, the posterior margin of the plate extending beyond the palp; articles 2 and 3 with no apparent suture, 0.75- 0.85mm in length and about four times as long as wide, narrowly rounded <b>distally.</b> Hypostome lanceolate and bluntly pointed; dentition mainly 3/3, the innermost file of small, spaced teeth, basally 2/2.|$|E
