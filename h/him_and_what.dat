5|$|Barkley's message {{sparked a}} great public {{debate about the}} nature of role models. He argued, I think the media demands that athletes be role models because there's some jealousy involved. It's as if they say, this is a young black kid playing a game for a living and making all this money, so we're going to make it tough on <b>him.</b> <b>And</b> <b>what</b> they're really doing is telling kids to look up to someone they can't become, because not many people can be like we are. Kids can't be like Michael Jordan.|$|E
500|$|Outliers {{has been}} {{described}} as a form of autobiography, as Gladwell mixes in elements from his own life into the book to give it a more personal touch. Lev Grossman, writing in Time magazine, called Outliers a [...] "more personal book than its predecessors", noting, [...] "If you hold it up to the light, at the right angle, you can read it as a coded autobiography: a successful man trying to figure out his own context, how success happened to <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> it means." [...] He also surmised that Gladwell feels guilty about his success and believes that Christopher Langan should have experienced the same success that he had.|$|E
500|$|Several of the show's crew praise Bumpass for his {{performance}} and similitude to the character. Kenny called Bumpass [...] "brilliant" [...] and said, [...] " [...] {{is sort of}} like Squidward". Staff writer Kent Osborne said, [...] "I remember thinking about how much Rodger talks and acts like Squidward. That's why it's such a good voice—he's so connected to it". However, Bumpass said, [...] "I'm not him and he's not me, but what I'm required to do for <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> I am enabled to do for him is what makes it like me. It fits my particular talents and skills very well. So in that respect, yeah, he is me, but I am not the cranky, sarcastic, underachieving kind of guy that he is. He's easy to fall in, I will say that." ...|$|E

500|$|Busch also commented, [...] "When Jeff Gordon {{has a good}} car and he's got the {{opportunity}} to beat you, he's going to beat you, there's no doubt about that. He's my hero and I've always watched <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> he's been able to accomplish over the years, so it's no surprise that he beat us." [...] The race result left Kyle Busch leading the Driver's Championship with 80 points. Kurt Busch, who finished eighth, was second with 77, eight points ahead of Stewart and Allmendinger. Gordon was fifth with 65 points. Ford maintained their lead in the Manufacturers' Championship with 12 points. Toyota and Chevrolet placed second and third with {{the same amount of}} points, four ahead of Dodge in fourth. 10.36 million people watched the race on television. The race took three hours, one minute and forty-nine seconds to complete, and the margin of victory was 1.137 seconds.|$|E
500|$|Kyle Busch, who {{finished}} second, said, [...] "He {{was on a}} mission today, that's for sure. When Jeff Gordon has a good car {{and he has the}} opportunity to beat you, he's going to beat you. He's my hero. I've always watched <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> he's been able to accomplish over the years." [...] In the subsequent press conference, pole position winner, Edwards, stated his frustration at his accident, [...] "I’m not exactly sure what happened. I’ll have to talk to Kyle about it. I thought at first he was just frustrated and he turned left to get back in line and he didn’t know I was there, but I watched the tape and I think he really did get loose. He hit me hard and I was left with nothing. I got rammed to the infield." [...] Rick Hendrick, the owner of Hendrick Motorsports, expressed his enjoyment of winning the race, stating, [...] "When you're a champion like Jeff Gordon, you know you can still do it, (even) when people overlook you. He's been right there but he hasn't had that edge. I think we're {{going to see a lot}} of momentum out of that team right now." ...|$|E
500|$|Mars {{revealed}} to Billboard in September 2012 on {{a preview of}} his cover story that he recorded an album that represented his freedom. On his debut record, Doo-Wops & Hooligans, the singer reportedly had to change some things because of pressure from his label, something he was displeased with. He clarified that Unorthodox Jukebox was more of <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> he stands for, mainly because he didn't have to modify things. He elaborated, [...] "If I'm changing things around because people might think it's a hard pill to swallow then I'm going {{to feel like a}} circus clown onstage, selling something fake". The variety of music styles presented on Unorthodox Jukebox resulted in his rejection from his label several times in the past; he also confessed that he had to face criticism by label presidents, who—according to him—expressed, [...] "Your music sucks, you don't know who you are, your music is all over the place, and we don't know how to market this stuff. Pick a lane and come back to us". To these statements, the singer added that he felt [...] "disgusted" [...] as he wanted to have the liberty to create his own music and not the music he was told to do.|$|E

2500|$|Aragorn {{marched on}} the Black Gate of Mordor with 7,000 men, knowing this force {{was far too}} small to {{actually}} defeat Sauron, but intending to cause a diversion to draw Sauron's armies away while Frodo and Sam journeyed to Mount Doom. After a brief encounter with the Mouth of Sauron, the battle was joined and went very poorly for the outnumbered Gondor/Rohan armies. Now wrongly convinced that Aragorn had the Ring, Sauron apparently reacted just as Gandalf had thought he would: [...] "I will crush <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> he has taken in his insolence shall be mine again for ever." ...|$|E

Roy Thomas, chief Executive of the Kidney Wales charity, told the Western Mail: [...] "He is a very modest man but the honour is more than deserved.

2500|$|Ja’far replied: “We were an uncivilised people.

He forbade us to commit abominations and to speak lies, and to devour the property of orphans, to vilify chaste women. He commanded us to worship God alone and not to associate anything with Him, and he gave us orders about prayer, alms and fasting [...] So we believed in <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> he brought to us from Allah; and we follow what he asked us to do and we avoid what he forbade us to do.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Dizzy Gillespie, a Bahá'í since 1968, {{was one of}} {{the most}} famous adherents of the Bahá'í Faith. It brought him to see himself as one of a series of musical messengers, part of a {{succession}} of trumpeters somewhat analogous to the series of prophets who bring God's message in religion. The universalist emphasis of his religion prodded him to see himself more as a global citizen and humanitarian, expanding on his already-growing interest in his African heritage. His increasing spirituality brought out a generosity in <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> author Nat Hentoff called an inner strength, discipline and [...] "soul force". Gillespie's conversion was most affected by Bill Sears' book Thief in the Night. Gillespie spoke about the Bahá'í Faith frequently on his trips abroad. He is honored with weekly jazz sessions at the New York Bahá'í Center in the memorial auditorium.|$|E

2500|$|Jackson and Steinbrenner would reconcile, and Steinbrenner {{would hire}} {{him as a}} [...] "special {{assistant}} to the principal owner", making Jackson a consultant and a liaison to the team's players, particularly the minority players. By this point, the Yankees, long noted for being slow to adapt to changes in race relations, have come to develop many minority players in their farm system and seek out others via trades and free agency. Jackson usually appears in uniform at the Yankee's spring training complex in Tampa, Florida, and was sought out for advice by such recent stars as Derek Jeter, before his retirement, and by former Yankee star Alex Rodriguez. [...] "His experience is vast, and he's especially good with the young players in our minor league system, the 17- and 18-year old kids. They respect <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> he's accomplished in his career.

2500|$|Allenby [...] {{arrived on}} 27 June 1917. On 31 July 1917 Allenby {{received}} a telegram {{from his wife}} saying that Michael Allenby {{had been killed in}} action, leading to Allenby to break down in tears in public while he recited a poem by Rupert Brooke. Afterwards, Allenby kept his grief to himself and his wife, and instead threw himself into his work with icy determination, working very long hours without a break. Wavell recalled: [...] "He went on with his work and asked no sympathy. Only those who stood close to him knew how heavy the blow had been, how nearly it had broken <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> courage it had taken to withstand it". Allenby assessed the Turkish Army's fighting force that he was facing to be 46,000 rifles and 2,800 sabres, and estimated that he could take Jerusalem with 7 infantry and 3 cavalry divisions. He did not feel that there was a sufficient military case to do so, and felt that he would need reinforcements to advance further. Allenby understood the problems posed by logistics in the desert and spent much time working to ensure his soldiers would be well supplied at all times, especially with water. The logistics of getting water to the soldiers and through the desert is thought to be the biggest challenge and accomplishment Allenby made in the Middle East campaign. Allenby also saw the importance of good medical treatment and insisted that proper medical facilities be created to treat all of the diseases common to the Middle East like ophthalmia and enteric fever. [...] Allenby was eventually ordered to attack the Turks in southern Palestine, but the extent of his advance was not yet to be decided, advice which Robertson repeated in [...] "secret and personal" [...] notes (1 and 10 August).|$|E
