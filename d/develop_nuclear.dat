5|$|Tube Alloys was a codename of the clandestine {{research}} and development programme, authorised by the United Kingdom, with participation from Canada, to <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons during the Second World War. Starting before the Manhattan Project in the United States, the British efforts were kept classified and as such had {{to be referred to}} by code even within the highest circles of government.|$|E
5|$|Mumma {{arrived back}} in the United States in December 1945, and {{returned}} to the Bureau of Ships. The Bureau's immediate post war priority was to <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> propulsion for ships. With the Chief of the Bureau, Rear Admiral Earle W. Mills, and Captain Paul F. Lee, he went to see Groves and Brigadier General Kenneth Nichols, the commander of the Manhattan District, who were willing to help, but would not offer any fissionable material. The Navy decided to proceed with the design of a nuclear-powered ship.|$|E
50|$|North Korea (officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea) {{has been}} active in <b>developing</b> <b>nuclear</b> {{technology}} since the 1950s. Although the country currently has no operational power-generating nuclear reactor, efforts at <b>developing</b> its <b>nuclear</b> power sector continue. Moreover, North Korea has <b>developed</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons; it conducted what are widely accepted to have been nuclear tests in 2006, 2009, 2013, and 2016.|$|R

5|$|The {{discovery}} of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932, followed by that of nuclear fission in uranium by the German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, and its theoretical explanation (and naming) by Lise Meitner and Otto Robert Frisch soon after, opened up {{the possibility of a}} nuclear chain reaction with uranium. Fears that a German atomic bomb project would <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons, especially among scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries, were expressed in the Einstein-Szilard letter. This prompted preliminary research in the United States in late 1939.|$|E
5|$|After the Oppenheimer controversy, Teller became ostracized by {{much of the}} {{scientific}} community, but was still quite welcome in the government and military science circles. Along with his traditional advocacy for nuclear energy development, a strong nuclear arsenal, and a vigorous nuclear testing program, he had helped to <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> reactor safety standards as {{the chair of the}} Reactor Safeguard Committee of the AEC in the late 1940s, and in the late 1950s headed an effort at General Atomics which designed research reactors in which a nuclear meltdown would be impossible. The TRIGA (Training, Research, Isotopes, General Atomic) has been built and used in hundreds of hospitals and universities worldwide for medical isotope production and research.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1986 U.S. attack, the army was purged of perceived disloyal elements, and in 1988, Gaddafi announced the creation of a popular militia to replace the army and police. In 1987, Libya began production of mustard gas at a facility in Rabta, although publicly denying it was stockpiling chemical weapons, and unsuccessfully attempted to <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons. The period also saw a growth in domestic Islamist opposition, formulated into groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. A number of assassination attempts against Gaddafi were foiled, and in turn, 1989 saw the security forces raid mosques believed to be centres of counter-revolutionary preaching. In October 1993, elements of the increasingly marginalized army initiated a failed coup in Misrata, while in September 1995, Islamists launched an insurgency in Benghazi, and in July 1996 an anti-Gaddafist football riot broke out in Tripoli. The Revolutionary Committees experienced a resurgence to combat these Islamists.|$|E

40|$|Most Iranians {{want their}} country {{to have the}} {{capacity}} to enrich uranium for nuclear energy, but a majority also agrees that Iran should comply with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which forbids signatories from <b>developing</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons.

25|$|The U.S. is advocating that Iran and North Korea {{should not}} <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons, while the U.S., {{the only country}} to have used nuclear weapons in warfare, {{maintains}} a nuclear arsenal of 5,113 warheads.

25|$|By October 1952, the United Kingdom {{had become}} the third country—after the United States and the Soviet Union—to {{independently}} test and <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons.

25|$|The UK {{has a large}} {{variety of}} {{different}} intermediate- and high-level radioactive wastes, coming from national programmes to <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons and nuclear power.

In addition, new nuclear power stations could be built, the waste management from which would be the private sector's financial responsibility, although all would be stored in a single facility. Most of the UK's higher-activity radioactive waste is currently held in temporary storage at Sellafield.|$|E
25|$|It {{was a major}} {{scientific}} {{effort of}} Pakistan. Project-706 refers specifically to the period from 1974–1983 when it was {{under the control of}} former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, and later on under the military administration of General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. The project's roots lay in scientists' fears since 1967 that India was also <b>developing</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons of its own. <b>Developing</b> <b>nuclear</b> technology for Pakistan was a main goal and of Prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto who initiated the scientific research in 1972.|$|R

25|$|Iran {{consistently}} {{claimed that}} {{its nuclear program}} is purely for civilian purposes, {{and that it has}} no intention of ever utilizing its peaceful nuclear program to <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons. During the course of Iran's recent history, specifically during the Iran-Iraq war, Iran has experienced significant outages of its commercial electricity grid. Iran has also continuously claimed that it intends to ultimately export part of the electricity produced by its nuclear reactors to its regional neighbors, as a way of diversifying its mainly oil-based economy to more diversified revenue streams.|$|E
25|$|Iran {{has had a}} {{civilian}} nuclear program since before the 1979 revolution. However, since the revolution, {{there has been some}} worries that Iran could use this program to <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons. These worries have been raised by the revelation, on August 2002, by Alireza Jafarzadeh, a prominent associate of MKO, of the existence of two secret nuclear sites: a uranium enrichment facility in Natanz (part of which is underground), and a heavy water facility in Arak. There is however no proof at this stage that this program is not purely civilian.|$|E
25|$|The United States was not {{particularly}} {{in favor of a}} nuclear Sweden. The cooperation agreement between Sweden and the United States, that established bilateral safeguards for Swedish nuclear installations, forbade Sweden from using equipment and materials to <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons. In the meantime, the use of U.S. uranium would mean accepting inspection requirements, which would prevent the uranium in question from being used for weapons production. The more Sweden’s research in nuclear weapons was becoming dependent on U.S. military assistance, the more the United States was willing to steer Sweden away from implementing its plans to create a nuclear weapon.|$|E

50|$|North Korea {{denounced the}} {{abrogation}} of paragraph 13(d) {{as an attempt}} to wreck the armistice agreement and turn Korea into a U.S. atomic warfare zone. It responded by digging massive underground fortifications resistant to nuclear attack, and forward deployment of its conventional forces so that the use of nuclear weapons against it would endanger South Korean and U.S. forces as well. In 1963, North Korea asked the Soviet Union for help in <b>developing</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons, but was refused.
