40|$|Authors: Lucas Kinard, Kurtis Kasper & Antonios Mikos ### Abstract This {{protocol}} {{describes the}} drying of dichloromethane {{by a simple}} 10 step procedure. One can implement this protocol using common lab glass and lab equipment. First, dichloromethane is refluxed with calcium hydride to remove water. Then, dichloromethane is distilled to separate it from the byproducts of the reflux reaction. This procedure can be implemented in 1 day. ### Introduction In many instances in synthetic chemistry {{it may be necessary}} to remove residual water from solvents in order to carry out a synthesis procedure under inert conditions. In this example, water is removed from dichloromethane by refluxing dichloromethane in the presence of calcium hydride at 60 °C. Under these conditions, calcium hydride reacts with water to form calcium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. The hydrogen gas is allowed to escape from the system through a drying tube while calcium hydroxide is separated from the anhydrous dichloromethane by distillation at 80 °C in a subsequent step. ### Reagents 1. Calcium hydride, ≥ 95 % (Sigma-Aldrich Co., cat. no. 208027 - 100 G) - Dichloromethane, ≥ 99. 5 %, ACS certified (EMD, cat. no. DX 0835 - 5) ### Equipment 1. Condenser (Chemglass, cat. no. CG- 1218 - 07) - Distillation adapter (Chemglass, cat. no. CG- 1024 - 01) - Drying tube, “U” shaped (Chemglass, cat. no. CG- 1296 - 01) - Glass thermometer (10 / 30) (Wilmad LabGlass, cat. no.

Add calcium hydride (20 g) and dichloromethane (700 mL) into a one-necked round-bottomed flask (1 L) and fit the round-bottomed flask with a condenser and drying tube filled with drierite (Figure 1). - CAUTION Calcium hydride and dichloromethane are irritating and/or harmful if exposed to the skin or inhaled. Calcium hydride releases flammable gases upon contact with water. Conduct all work in a chemical fume hood. Proper personal protective equipment (lab coat, nitrile gloves, and safety glasses) should be worn throughout the procedure. - Stir the mixture using a magnetic stir bar. - Heat the reaction flask to 60 °C using a heating mantle and reflux at 60 °C for 2 h. Under these conditions, calcium hydride reacts with water to form calcium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. The hydrogen gas is allowed to escape from the system through a drying tube. - After 2 h, cool the reaction flask to room temperature (20 - 25 °C). - PAUSE POINT Once cooled, the dichloromethane/calcium hydride mixture may be sealed and stored overnight in the fume hood, if necessary. - **Distillation of dichloromethane TIMING ~ 6 h** 5. Attach the flask from Step 4 to the apparatus shown in Figure 2 with a 100 mL receiving flask. - Stir the mixture using a magnetic stir bar and heat the reaction flask to 80 °C using a heating mantle. - Collect the first 30 mL distillate in the 100 mL receiving flask and then replace with a 1000 mL receiving flask. - CRITICAL STEP The first 30 mL distillate may contain residual water and should be discarded. - Continue heating until ~ 600 mL anhydrous dichloromethane has been collected in the receiving flask. - Once the desired amount of anhydrous dichloromethane has been collected, cool the reaction flask to room temperature. - Once cooled, seal the flask with the remaining mixture from step 1 and store in the fume hood awaiting either reuse of unreacted calcium hydride or disposal. ### Figures **Figure 1 : Drying of dichloromethane** ![Fig 1]([URL] "Fig 1 ") **Figure 2 : Distillation of dichloromethane** ![Fig 2]([URL] "Fig 2 ") ### Associated Publications **Synthesis of oligo(poly(ethylene glycol) fumarate) **.

In this way, better agreement between the one-dimensional results and the experimental data was realized, at least in the frequency range characterized by planar wave propagation (below 800 Hz). Once validated, the one-dimensional model was coupled to an external optimizer to perform acoustic and fluid-dynamic optimizations of the considered muffler. Initially, a genetic algorithm was employed to modify the internal muffler geometry and to improve the transmission loss, in the absence of mean flow, in the 100 - 800 Hz frequency range.

50|$|Steel loses {{strength}} when heated sufficiently. The {{critical temperature}} of a steel member is the temperature {{at which it}} cannot safely support its load. Building codes and structural engineering standard practice defines different critical temperatures depending on the structural element type, configuration, orientation, and loading characteristics. The critical temperature is often considered the temperature at which its yield stress {{has been reduced to}} 60% of the room temperature yield stress. In order to determine the fire resistance rating of a steel member, accepted calculations practice can be used, or a fire test can be performed, the critical temperature of which is set by the standard accepted to the Authority Having Jurisdiction, such as a building code. In Japan, this is below 400 °C. In China, Europe and North America (e.g., ASTM E-119), this is approximately 1000-1300 °F (530-810 °C). The time it takes for the steel element that is being tested to reach the temperature set by the test standard determines the duration of the fire-resistance rating.Heat transfer to the steel can be slowed by the use of fireproofing materials, thus limiting steel temperature. Common fireproofing methods for structural steel include intumescent, endothermic, and plaster coatings as well as drywall, calcium silicate cladding, and mineral <b>wool</b> <b>insulating</b> blankets.|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} is to calculate the values of parameters obtained by the regression of watersorption experimental data using Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) and Guggenheim, Anderson and de Boer (GAB) and Three Sorption Stages (TSS) isotherms. We have chosen these isotherms because of their complementarity's range of relative pressures regression. BET isotherm can be applied for data until 0. 4 even though GAB isotherm can be fitted until 0. 84 and TSS one can be used on the whole range of relative pressures. Usually, new parameters are calculated independently for each (BET, GAB or TSS) model. There after, these values obtained from different models are compared. We have used this method in a first time. In a second time, another method is proposed: parameters are not independently calculated but values of the two parameters (monolayer and the energy constants) determined with the BET model are retained and used in the GAB model. So, we fit the experimental data with the BET values and a new additional constant, denoted k. Thereafter, GAB parameters are completed in TSS model by introducing a new constant, called h* to fit the whole range of relative pressures...|$|R
40|$|Requests {{of energy}} {{reduction}} and efficiency {{has contributed to}} improve environmental aspects in construction. It has also —mainly for the insulat-ing materials used—raised a new issue: the environmental sustainability of building materials and products. Assessment of the environmental impact produced by any human activity is, in general, very complex and nowadays very debated. It involves a local and global scale, the biosphere — in which humans {{are not the only}} protagonists — and all valuation methods must be considered. The build-ing sector in particular consumes a significant amount of resources, both when producing components and in construction. Construction uses large amount of energy for heating, releases as much pollutant emissions and form massive volumes of mixed waste after demolition. The use of wood in construction meets the main objectives for achieving sustainable development. This is possible through ecological forest man-agement combined with the low environmental impact of products made from wood. Wood is the only renewable resource in building materials. It possesses the capacity to be repaired, reused, efficiently recycled and recovered as fuel {{at the end of its}} life cycle. The contribution of this study is to quantitatively calculate and qualita-tively exam the environmental impacts —positive and negative— produced by the use of wood based components in structures. The focus is specifically <b>insulating</b> wood <b>wool</b> cement boards. The environmental sustainability assessment was combined with a technological analysis in order to verify the thermal performance of the insulation boards and the suitability of structural wood harvested from the Alps forests. The environmental assessment was performed through a life cycle analy-sis and developed according to ISO 14040 standard series, with an environmental product declaration oriented approach. The impact analy-sis was done in the specific software SimaPro 7. 3, including the uncertainty analyses. For the classification and characterization two dif-ferent life cycle impact assessment methods were used. The inventory analysis required a detailed data collection, in this case performed on the production process of a wood wool cement board. The results show that short wood chain supply and different energy pro-duction scenarios lead to a better environmental performance. This study allowed a quantification of the benefits of a short supply chain and eco-design by identifying opportunities for improvement of the wood wool cement board production process and the choice of insulating mate-rials to be included in the building design...|$|R

40|$|AbstractLying between Chile's {{agricultural}} Central Valley and {{the wilds}} of Patagonia, the micro region of Araucanía Andina, is seeing a rise in both national and international tourism. With its snow-capped volcanoes, national parks, native forests and indigenous Mapuche culture, the region offers {{a wide range of}} activities to the Special Interest Tourist. The development of winter sports facilities and the growth in Northern Hemisphere visitors during the austral winter is extending the season, in what was previously predominantly a destination for Chilean summer holidaymakers. The tourism infrastructure must therefore respond to provide comfortable, energy efficient, sustainable accommodation during both the cold wet winters and short hot summers, meeting the expectations of an ever more demanding international market. The government funded research project “Sustainable Construction System and Energy Efficiency for Special Interest Tourist Infrastructure in the Araucanía Andina,” FONDEF Regional D 10 R 1003, aims to provide the knowledge needed by the local tourist industry to achieve this goal. This paper presents the methodology and outcomes of the project, including the study of local vernacular architecture, post occupation evaluation of existing infrastructure, bioclimatic analysis, environmental and technical assessment of insulation and construction materials, digital simulation of proposals and the construction of physical test cells. The resulting proposal is a system of timber-framed walls, <b>insulated</b> with sheep's <b>wool,</b> finished externally with a ventilated façade. It is hoped that this prefabricated system, in conjunction with best practice guidelines for construction and management, should enable a sustainable future for the region's tourism. At the same time, the methodology provides a replicable template that has already been applied in other regions of the country...|$|R
40|$|Spherical cavity {{receiver}} {{of solar}} concentrator {{is made up}} of Cu tubing material having cavity diameter 385 mm to analyze the different heat losses such as conduction, convection and radiation. As the convection loss plays major role in heat loss analysis of cavity receiver, the experimental analysis is carried out to study convective heat loss for the temperature range of 55 - 75 °C at 0 °, 15 °, 30 °, 45 °, 60 °, and 90 ° inclination angle of downward facing cavity receiver. The numerical analysis is carried out to study convective heat loss for the low temperature range (55 - 75 °C) as well as high temperature range (150 - 300 °C) for no wind condition only. The experimental set-up mainly consists of spherical cavity receiver which is <b>insulated</b> with glass <b>wool</b> insulation to reduce the heat losses from outside surface. The numerical analysis is carried out by using CFD software and the results are compared with the experimental results and found good agreement. The result shows that the convective loss increases with decrease in cavity inclination angle and decreases with decrease in mean cavity receiver temperature. The maximum losses are obtained at 0 ° inclination angle and the minimum losses are obtained at 90 ° inclination angle of cavity due to increase in stagnation zone in to the cavity from 0 ° to 90 ° inclination. The Nusselt number correlation is developed for the low temperature range 55 - 75 °C based on the experimental data. The analysis is also carried out to study the effect of wind speed and wind direction on convective heat losses. The convective heat losses are studied for two wind speeds (3 m/s and 5 m/s) and four wind directions [α is 0 ° (Side-on wind), 30 °, 60 °, and 90 ° (head-on wind) ]. It is found that the convective heat losses for both wind speed are higher than the losses obtained by no wind test. The highest heat losses are found for wind direction α is 60 ° with respect to receiver stand and lowest heat losses are found for wind direction α is 0 ° (side-on wind). The heat losses obtained for wind direction, α, is 30 ° condition are higher than the heat losses obtained for wind direction α is 0 ° (side-on wind) condition, while the heat losses obtained by wind direction α is 90 ° (head-on wind) condition are less than the heat losses obtained for wind direction, α, is 60 ° condition...|$|R
