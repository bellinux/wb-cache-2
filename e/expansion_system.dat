25|$|The {{successful}} {{outcome of}} fat-graft breast augmentation {{is enhanced by}} achieving a pre-expanded recipient site to create the breast-tissue matrix that will receive grafts of autologous adipocyte fat. The recipient site is expanded with an external vacuum tissue-expander applied upon each breast. The biological effect of negative pressure (vacuum) expansion upon soft tissues derives from the ability of soft tissues to grow when subjected to controlled, distractive, mechanical forces. (see distraction osteogenesis) The study Non-surgical Breast Enlargement using an External Soft Tissue <b>Expansion</b> <b>System</b> (2000) reported the technical effectiveness of recipient-site pre-expansion. In a single-group study, 17 healthy women (aged 18–40 years) wore a brassiere-like vacuum system that applied a 20-mmHg vacuum (controlled, mechanical, distraction force) to each breast for 10–12 hours daily for 10-weeks. Pre- and post-procedure, the breast volume (size) was periodically measured; likewise, a magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the breast-tissue architecture and water density was taken during the same phase of the patient's menstrual cycle; of the 17-woman study group, 12 completed the study, and 5 withdrew, because of non-compliance with the clinical trial protocol.|$|E

50|$|Micro Channel Architecture (MCA) vs. Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA). Up to the {{introduction}} of MCA, personal computers had relied on a 16 bit <b>expansion</b> <b>system</b> which was later christened 'Industry Standard Architecture' (ISA). IBM introduced a new range of personal computers featuring a new 32 bit <b>expansion</b> <b>system</b> which they called MCA. It was at this point {{that the rest of the}} personal computer industry named the existing <b>expansion</b> <b>system</b> as ISA. IBM wanted substantial royalties from any manufacturer wishing to adopt the MCA system (largely in an attempt to recover lost royalties that they believed that they were owed due to the wholesale cloning of their original 'PC', a task that was greatly simplified by the 'off the shelf' nature of the design). IBM's competitors jointly responded by introducing the EISA <b>expansion</b> <b>system</b> which, unlike MCA, was fully compatible with the existing ISA cards. In the event, neither MCA nor EISA really caught on, and the PCI standard was eventually adopted instead.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMany of today’s most {{efficient}} numerical methods {{are based on}} multilevel decompositions: The multigrid algorithm {{is based on a}} hierarchy of grids, wavelet techniques use a hierarchy of basis functions, while fast panel-clustering and multipole methods employ a hierarchy of clusters. The high efficiency of these methods {{is due to the fact}} that the hierarchies are nested, i. e., that the information present on a coarser level is also present on finer levels, thus allowing efficient recursive algorithms. H 2 -matrices employ nested local <b>expansion</b> <b>systems</b> in order to approximate matrices in optimal (or for some problem classes at least optimal up to logarithmic factors) order of complexity.

This paper provides a literature review on ejector efficiency in various ejector systems, such as refrigeration and heat pump systems (transcritical systems and subcritical systems), solar systems, and steam systems. The definitions of ejector efficiency and ejector component efficiencies in literature are summarized. The assumed constant ejector component efficiencies used in ejector modeling, and the empirical correlations of ejector efficiencies derived based on measured data are summarized and compared; {{the methods of}} determining energy efficiencies are summarized. The effects of ejector geometries, operation conditions and working fluid characteristics (single phase or two-phase, zeotropic or azeotropic) on ejector efficiencies are discussed. The prospects of ejector application in and beyond the field of refrigeration are also discussed. The potential of ejector used in the low-pressure working fluids ejector systems are discussed based on variation of ejector efficiencies. This review will be useful for the further research on ejector efficiency, optimum operation and control of ejector <b>expansion</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
