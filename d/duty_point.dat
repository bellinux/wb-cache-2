Authors have done CFD analysis of mixed flow pump (Nsq. = 46. 00 Metric) at <b>duty</b> <b>point</b> and also at part load. The {{results of the study}} brought out following findings. 1. Head predicted by CFD analysis is 5 to 10 % higher at rated point as well as at part load, than the test result. The nature of Head versus Capacity curve {{is similar to that of}} standard mixedflow pump curve. 2. Power predicted by CFD analysis is 5 to 10 % higher at rated point. Disc- friction power loss calculated using standard method and added to CFX generated power for estimating total power requirement. The nature of Power versus Capacity curve is similar to that of standard mixed flow pump curve. 3. Efficiency predicted by CFD analysis is higher than the test results. Leakage loss was predicted and volumetric efficiency was determined. Pump efficiency, considering disc-friction loss and leakage-loss was predicted and that is within + 5 % range, at <b>duty</b> <b>point.</b> At off-design point, variation in efficiency was found.

40|$|Axial {{air flow}} fans {{are widely used}} for air movement. In an {{increasingly}} international and competitive market, smaller fan companies find themselves in need of rapid preliminary design. This need is addressed in this study {{through the development of}} a first-revision, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) based, optimisation tool which allows for rapid prototyping of a ducted axial fan. The result is an ElementalTM-based multi-disciplinary software tool, comprising 2 D CFD, mesh movement, and constrained geometric optimisation. The analytical equation employed to represent the aerofoil significantly reduces the cost of the optimisation. A pseudo- 3 D fan model is generated by superimposing 2 D CFD results. This is done without the general assumption of the free-vortex method, which is not a necessity for fan design and other velocity distributions may be used. For this purpose, an enhanced finite volume discretisation method was developed. A penalty function minimisation, by means of an unconstrained optimisation algorithm, is implemented thereafter. The primary objective is to deliver a specific fan static pressure rise, while optimising for fan static efficiency by means of altering the rotor blade geometry. The spherical quadratic steepest descent method is employed, which does not rely on any explicit line searches, as required by traditional steepest descent techniques. The rapid prototyping tool is finally applied to an under-performing base fan (Fan-D) which cannot meet a specified <b>duty</b> <b>point.</b> The resulting optimised fan (Fan-Optim) is manufactured and experimentally tested, in accordance with the ISO 5801 standard. The pseudo- 3 D model is proven to predict fan performance accurately at the target <b>duty</b> <b>point,</b> while capturing fan behaviour over a range of volumetric flow rates. The former is to within 13 % of the fan static pressure rise and within 2. 3 % of fan static efficiency. While Fan-Optim meets the desired <b>duty</b> <b>point</b> within 2 %, it offers a considerable improvement in fan static efficiency over Fan-D. Furthermore, an approximate 38 % reduction in blade material is achieved as a secondary effect...|$|E

As the result, the trend of reduction of energy consumption has been determined if the proportional pressure control mode is used in comparison with constant differential pressure control mode. The control modes are compared if the value of the <b>duty</b> <b>point</b> remains invariable for both modes.

The SCM design procedure presented in the paper proves to be a robust and accurate tool for the runner blade row design...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{impeller}} of {{an existing}} industrial pump (with both geometry and performance known) was analyzed and redesigned using an integrated, design/analysis, turbomachinery geometry modeling and flow simulation system. The purpose of the redesign was to achieve improved impeller performance (at the <b>duty</b> <b>point).</b> Fluid dynamics and geometry modeling parts of the design/analysis system were systematically applied: a) to analyse the existing impeller (impeller A), which was designed using conventional (routine in industry) hydraulic layout procedures, and b) {{to develop a new}} impeller (impeller B), using a coupled, multilevel 1 D-Q 3 D- 3 D for the design and optimization. This paper discusses the features and advantages of the integrated design system, in which the coupled CAD/CFD approach is fully implemented. The analysis results are presented for impellers A and B, with the latter demonstrating a predicted increased efficiency and smaller size. Comparisons of the CFD results for both impellers reveal internal flow features that explain the improved impeller B performance levels...|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the assessment of}} a novel methodology that the authors recently proposed for the early detection of stall in low-speed axial-flow fans. Because aerodynamic stall is a major potential cause of mechanical failure in axial fans, effective stall-warning techniques have had wide application for many years. This paper presents an acoustic stall-warning system that can identify stall pre-cursors, and in so doing, establish that the stall is incipient. The study illustrates {{the application of the}} stall-detection technique to a class of heavy duty fans for induced draft service in coal-fired power plants. With an installed power up to 10 MW, this class of fans operates at constant rotational speed, utilising variable-pitch in motion blades to adjust fan <b>duty</b> <b>point.</b> The authors characterise the acoustic stall-detection system in an industrial laboratory environment exploring the fan operating envelope from maximum to minimum pitch angle. The authors record the evolution of transient unsteady pressure events with microphones fitted into i) the fan casing over the fan blades and ii) in the inlet plenum one diameter upstream of the fan rotor. Whilst the authors know that the measurement of unsteady pressure evolution potentially facilitates the prediction of stall incipience, the present investigation demonstrates the possibility of detecting stall events with pre-polarised pressure transducers in the far-field...|$|E

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is the derivation of the method for evaluation of efficiency improvement potential for public water supply systems with a focus on centrifugal network pumps. The efficiency of proportional pressure control usage has been analyzed for variable speed pumps.

40|$|LecturePg. 39 - 50 Two main {{problems}} must {{be solved}} {{in the planning}} and execution of compressor sets to be installed within refrigeration loops. The use of several compressors with different sidestream admissions calls for the installation of a control system for optimizing the parallel operation of the machines, {{even if there are}} differences in their performance curves, due to reactions to the pipework, minor manufacturing tolerances, or the use of varying frame sizes. To ensure uniform loading of the stage groups and the same distance from their respective surge limits in the case of constant discharge pressures, throttle valves are installed in the compressor intake pipes for actuation by the control system presented. Protection from surging is provided by an anti-surge control system, which includes a dynamic control line to respond to sudden changes in the <b>duty</b> <b>point,</b> as well as an additional anti-surge safety line preceding the surge limit. Unlike in other turbomachinery applications, the startup operation must be carefully studied early in the project planning stage of the refrigeration loop.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is the derivation of criteria of effectiveness evaluation of centrifugal pumps in district heating systems. For this purpose, efficiency level of centrifugal pumps of various designs has been analyzed at certain head and flow range. The change of efficiency level of circulators has also been investigated in the article. It’s been done at different deviations from nominal pump head. As a criterion, the effectiveness of proportional pressure control has been analyzed for pumps with variable speed motors. It’s been done if proportional pressure control is used in comparison with constant pressure control. For these reasons, a great number of energy analyses have been realized for different pumps and regression equations with coefficients of determination have been derived. As the result, the three criteria of effectiveness evaluation of centrifugal pumps have been derived and the trend of reduction of energy consumption has been determined. The conclusions are as follows: • vertical in-line single-stage pumps are less efficient in comparison with horizontal end-suction singlestage pumps, when the flow rate varies from 20 to 220 m 3 /h at the definite range of the head (from 10 to 72 m); • the reduction of annual energy consumption can be achieved up to 33 %, if proportional pressure is applied and deviations from head value of <b>duty</b> <b>point</b> at zero flow declines up to 60 %; • efficiency level drops up to 3 % if the deviation of the head value of best efficiency point is up to 30 % from its nominal value...|$|E

40|$|LectureIn 2014 a {{full scale}} high {{viscosity}} pump performance test was performed for a 2 -stage vertically suspended (VS 1) API 610 pump. The high viscosity test scope {{was part of}} an ongoing EPC project and exclusively conducted for industrial purposes. The objective was to simulate real field operation with crude oil and qualify the pump for the given field conditions and requirements. Furthermore, the reason for conducting this test scope was the uncertainties in published methods of predicting high viscosity fluid pump characteristics, limited available literature, hence reduce field operation risks. The official test scope was divided into two main scenarios: 1) Start-up test at minimum. flow and a viscosity of 3075 cP, 2) Pump performance test with an intermittent <b>duty</b> <b>point</b> (reduced flow) of 850 m 3 /h- 125 m (3654 USgpm- 410 ft), and a viscosity of 1075 cP. Internal tests with various viscosities from 480 cP to 3075 cP were also done in preparation for the official tests. Measured results were then compared to published methods for pump characteristics viscosity correction. The objective for these additional analyzes was to evaluate possible alternative approaches in order to improve uncertainties with viscous prediction and ultimately reduce the number of tests/test scope in future projects. It should be emphasized that this comparison is simply for discussion within the industry and not for validation of published methods of viscosity correction for pump characteristics. The test results provide valuable insight on the effects of high viscosity on centrifugal pump performance curves, allowing a more accurate rating and possibly a better optimization of the process equipment, e. g. electrical motor, valves, cooling system, by improving the flow characteristics predictions...|$|E
40|$|The {{flow path}} {{close to the}} suction side of fan rotor blades mostly-affects the overall drag of the blading. The blade lift is {{affected}} as well because {{of the separation of}} the low energy boundary layer that drives the blade into stall at low fan flow rates. Forward sweep allows to position the airfoil sections of blades featuring a positive circulation gradient along the span so that they "accompany" the near-wall flow trajectories at the blade suction side. So, rotor efficiency and stall margin of the fan can be improved. On the other hand, blade end effects play a relevant role in high hub-to-tip and low aspect ratio rotors and may compromise the effectiveness of forward sweep. Nevertheless, some authors in the literature stated the beneficial contribution of changing the sweep angle at the ends of the blade both at design and off-design conditions. The paper studies the end effects on constant-swirl design rotors by means of CFD simulations focusing on the distribution of blade sweep in the near-tip region. In particular, the performance and efficiency calculated for a forward swept tube-axial fan featuring a hub-to-tip ratio equal to 0. 4 are compared with those estimated for the corresponding unswept fan at equal <b>duty</b> <b>point.</b> Several modifications of the sweep distribution in the blade tip region are considered in the swept fan to quantify their effect on performance, efficiency and stall margin. Results show that the addition of up to 6 degrees of local forward sweep at the blade tip to the unswept blading does not affect fan pressure at design operation. On the other hand, this local increase of the sweep angle allows for a very notable increase of the peak pressure and efficiency at flow rates close to stall inception...|$|E
40|$|A new {{vertical}} single-regulated {{mixed-flow turbine}} with conical guide apparatus and without spiral casing {{is presented in}} this paper. Runner blades are fixed to the hub and runner band and resemble to the Francis type runner of extremely high specific speed. Due to lack of information and guidelines {{for the design of}} a new turbine, a theoretical model was developed in order to determinate the design <b>duty</b> <b>point,</b> i. e. to determine the optimum narrow operation range of the turbine. It is not necessary to know the kinematic conditions at the runner inlet, but only general information on the geometry of turbine flow-passage, meridional contour of the runner and blading, the number of blades and the turbine speed of rotation. The model is based on the integral tangential lift coefficient, which is the average value over the entire runner blading. The results are calculated for the lift coefficient 0. 5 and 0. 6, for the flow coefficient range from 0. 2 to 0. 36, for the number of the blades between 5 and 13, and are finally presented in the Cordier diagram (specific speed vs. specific diameter). Calculated results of the turbine optimum operation in Cordier diagram correspond very well to the adequate area of Kaplan turbines with medium and low specific speed and extends into the area of Francis turbines with high specific speed. Presented model clearly highlights the parameters that affect specific load of the runner blade row and therefore the optimum turbine operation (discharge-turbine head). The presented method is not limited to a specific reaction type of the hydraulic turbine. The method can therefore be applied to a wide range from mixed-flow (radial-axial) turbines to the axial turbines. Applicability of the method may be considered as a tool in the first stage of the turbine design i. e. when designing the meridional geometry and selecting the number of blades according to calculated operating point. Geometric and energy parameters are generally defined to an extent that these parameters are considered in detailed design using turbulent viscous flow CFD solver...|$|E
