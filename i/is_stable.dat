5|$|A {{more radical}} {{development}} was the synthesis in 2006 of bis(diisopropylamino)cyclopropenylidene by Bertrand's group. In this compound, which <b>is</b> <b>stable</b> at room temperature, the carbene atom {{is connected to}} two carbon atoms, in a three-member ring that retains the aromaticity and geometry of the cyclopropenylidene ring. This example demonstrated {{that the presence of}} heteroatoms next to the carbene is not necessary for stability, either.|$|E

5|$|ATP <b>is</b> <b>stable</b> in aqueous {{solutions}} between pH6.8 and 7.4, but it {{is rapidly}} hydrolysed at more extreme pH's. ATP hydrolyses to ADP and phosphate.

5|$|Aspirin {{decomposes}} {{rapidly in}} solutions of ammonium acetate or the acetates, carbonates, citrates, or hydroxides of the alkali metals. It <b>is</b> <b>stable</b> in dry air, but gradually hydrolyses {{in contact with}} moisture to acetic and salicylic acids. In solution with alkalis, the hydrolysis proceeds rapidly and the clear solutions formed may consist entirely of acetate and salicylate.|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{significance}} for planetary cores, the physical properties of iron at high pressures and temperatures {{have also been}} studied extensively.

50|$|Given a pre-abelian category, those kernels, which <b>are</b> <b>stable</b> under {{arbitrary}} pushouts, {{are sometimes}} called the semi-stable kernels. Dually, cokernels, which <b>are</b> <b>stable</b> under arbitrary pullbacks, are called semi-stable cokernels.|$|R

5|$|Bismuth {{was long}} {{considered}} the element {{with the highest}} atomic mass that <b>is</b> <b>stable.</b> However, in 2003 it was discovered to be extremely weakly radioactive: its only primordial isotope, bismuth-209, decays via alpha decay with a half-life {{more than a billion}} times the estimated age of the universe. Because of its tremendously long half-life, bismuth may still be considered stable for almost all purposes.|$|E
5|$|Caesium {{fluoride}} is also {{a popular}} source of fluoride in organofluorine chemistry. For example, CsF reacts with hexafluoroacetone to form a caesium perfluoroalkoxide salt, which <b>is</b> <b>stable</b> up to 60°C, unlike the corresponding sodium or potassium salt. It will convert electron-deficient aryl chlorides to aryl fluorides (halex reaction).|$|E
5|$|For most bikes, {{depending}} on geometry and mass distribution, capsize <b>is</b> <b>stable</b> at low speeds, and becomes less stable as speed increases {{until it is}} no longer stable. However, on many bikes, tire interaction with the pavement is sufficient to prevent capsize from becoming unstable at high speeds.|$|E
30|$|The {{positive}} equilibrium <b>is</b> absolutely <b>stable</b> if it <b>is</b> asymptotically <b>stable</b> {{for every}} delay τ≥ 0 and <b>is</b> conditionally <b>stable</b> if it <b>is</b> asymptotically <b>stable</b> for τ in some finite interval.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we study}} {{stability}} properties of norms on the complex numbers {{and on the}} quaternions. Our main findings are that these norms <b>are</b> <b>stable</b> {{if and only if}} they majorize the modulus function and that not all <b>stable</b> norms <b>are</b> strongly <b>stable.</b> Part of the paper is devoted to the standard matrix representations of the above number systems, where we show that norms on the corresponding matrix algebras <b>are</b> <b>stable</b> if and only if they are spectrally dominant.

5|$|Lutetium {{occurs on}} the Earth {{in form of}} two isotopes: lutetium-175 and lutetium-176. Out of these two, only the former <b>is</b> <b>stable,</b> making the element monoisotopic.

40|$|The Majority <b>is</b> <b>Stablest</b> Theorem has {{numerous}} {{applications in}} hardness of approximation and social choice theory.

5|$|Weinreb and Nahm {{originally}} {{proposed the}} following reaction mechanism {{to explain the}} selectivity shown in reactions of the Weinreb–Nahm amide. Their suggestion was that the tetrahedral intermediate (A below) formed {{as a result of}} nucleophilic acyl substitution by the organometallic reagent is stabilized by chelation from the methoxy group as shown.

5|$|All main-sequence {{stars have}} a core region where energy is {{generated}} by nuclear fusion. The temperature and density of this core are at the levels necessary to sustain the energy production that will support {{the remainder of the}} star. A reduction of energy production would cause the overlaying mass to compress the core, resulting in an increase in the fusion rate because of higher temperature and pressure. Likewise an increase in energy production would cause the star to expand, lowering the pressure at the core. Thus the star forms a self-regulating system in hydrostatic equilibrium that <b>is</b> <b>stable</b> over the course of its main sequence lifetime.|$|E
