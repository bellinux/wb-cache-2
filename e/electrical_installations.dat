25|$|The {{most popular}} simple snubber circuit {{consists}} {{out of a}} film capacitor and a resistor in series, connected in parallel with a semiconductor component to suppress or damp undesirable voltage spikes. The capacitor absorbs the inductive turn-off peak current temporarily, so that the resulting voltage spike is limited. But the trend in modern semiconductor technology is towards higher power applications, which increases the peak currents and switching speeds. In this case, the boundary between a standard electronic film capacitor and a power capacitor is blurred, so that larger snubber capacitors belong more {{in the area of}} power systems, <b>electrical</b> <b>installations</b> and plants.|$|E
25|$|In May 2012, a BFK manager {{challenged}} their subcontractor, <b>Electrical</b> <b>Installations</b> Services Ltd. (EIS), {{saying that}} one of their electricians was a trade union activist. Some days later, Pat Swift, the HR manager for BFK and a regular user of the Consulting Association, again challenged EIS. EIS refused to dismiss their worker and lost the contract. Flash pickets were held at the Crossrail site and also at the sites of the BFK partners. The Scottish Affairs Select Committee called on the UK Business Secretary, Vince Cable, to set up a government investigation into blacklisting at Crossrail. The electrician was reinstated. Further allegations of blacklisting against Crossrail were made in Parliament in September 2017.|$|E
25|$|A decree of 23 March 1982 {{listed the}} offices {{responsible}} for testing lifting equipment other than lifts and building-site hoists, while a decree issued in May {{that same year}} 1982 extended its provisions to agriculture. Under a decree of 31 March 1982, the general health and safety regulations for dangerous machinery and appliances were extended to include portable hand operated machinery and appliances. Exceptions for certain less dangerous appliances were laid down in a decree of June 1982. In regards to the agricultural sector, a decree of 8 March 1982 laid down the conditions attached to the approval of <b>electrical</b> <b>installations</b> in agricultural undertakings and specified which offices are authorized to test these installations. In 1983, leave was introduced for setting up businesses and sabbatical leave for wage-earners, and in June that year, a law was passed that completed the incorporation into French Law of a 1977 European Council Directive on the approximation {{of the laws of}} the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses.|$|E

25|$|Decrees {{were made}} in January 1982 {{concerning}} official recognition of persons and bodies responsible for noise monitoring, the monitoring of carbon monoxide and benzene levels in the atmosphere at workplaces, and the inspection of <b>electrical</b> <b>installations.</b> A decree issued in February 1982 laid down safety measures to be taken against electrical hazards arising during the construction, operation and maintenance of electric power distribution installations. A decree issued by the Minister of Labour in March 1982 specified the offices responsible for carrying out the technical tests on particularly dangerous machinery (listed in a decree of April 1981) which are required before the machinery can be officially approved. It also specified the {{information to be provided}} by the person applying for official approval. A decree of May 1982 contained provisions on the setting up, restructuring, organization, financing and tasks of occupational health services in agricultural undertakings and listed those agricultural undertakings for which special medical surveillance is required. Another decree, made that same month, contained new regulations governing health, safety and preventive health measures in public undertakings. It laid down detailed health and safety requirements and specified how these were to be met. It also contained provisions on training in the area, medical surveillance, and health and safety services. Two Orders of July 1982 amended the rules applicable to fixed-term contracts and temporary work with the intention of restricting the use of casual labour and improving the living and working conditions of workers in insecure jobs. A law of July 1982 concerning the spouses of craftsmen and tradesmen employed in the family business amended the provisions of the labour code, social security system, civil code and company law to establish an occupational status for this group of people. In June 1982, a new popular savings book paying index-linked interest was introduced, under which Individuals domiciled for tax purposes in France and whose tax liability was under FF 1 000 were entitled to hold a maximum of FF 10000 (FF 20000 for households) savings in that scheme. Also in 1982, holidays for the low-paid were encouraged by an extension of holiday Vouchers (Cheques-Vacances), subsidized by the employer and requiring regular saving out of earnings. A banking law of January 1984 entitled individuals lacking current accounts who had been refused by three banks to ask the Bank of France to designate a bank or the postal bank to provide them with free accounts.|$|E
500|$|The 1st Army Troops Company was {{responsible}} for Port Moresby’s utilities: the power house, freezers, <b>electrical</b> <b>installations,</b> lighting and water supply. By June 1942 the water supply was close to its maximum capacity, with the pumping station at Bomana pumping water from the Laloki River 24 hours a day. The main [...] water main ran under the south eastern end of the Jackson Drome, a prime target for Japanese air raids, and the water pipe was consequently prone to damage. From one cause or another there were 40 to 50 breaks per month. By October 1942 the reservoir level was falling, indicating that usage was exceeding pumping capacity. A new intake and pumping station was constructed near Schwimmer Drome to bring water from the Laloki River to a treatment plant and concrete reservoir on Twin Peaks Mountain. The 1st Army Troops Company assumed responsibility for its operation upon its completion in March 1943.|$|E

The research team worked on lens design and CRO column placement, to optimize parameters to construct better CROs, and make electron optical components to generate low magnification (nearly 1:1) images. In 1931 the group successfully generated magnified images of mesh grids placed over the anode aperture. The device used two magnetic lenses to achieve higher magnifications, arguably creating the first electron microscope. In that same year, Reinhold Rudenberg, the scientific director of the Siemens company, [...] patented an electrostatic lens electron microscope.|$|E

2500|$|In November 1915 a joint LEE/TEE {{company was}} formed for service in France, {{designated}} No 1 (London and Tyne) Electrical & Mechanical Company, RE.

2500|$|There are {{two common}} misconceptions about {{the purpose of}} the fuse in a BS 1363 plug, one is that it protects the {{appliance}} connected to the plug, and the other is that it protects against overloading. [...] In fact the fuse is there to protect the flexible cord between the plug and the appliance under fault conditions (typical British ring circuits can deliver more current than appliance flexible power cords can handle). BS1363 plugs are required to carry a cartridge fuse, which must conform to BS1362. [...] Post-War Building Studies No. 11, <b>Electrical</b> <b>Installations</b> included the recommendation that Provision should be made in the plug for the accommodation of a cartridge type of fuse for 13amps., and alternatively, for 3amps. Fuses of these ratings should be interchangeable and be readily identified. [...] The original BS1363:1947 specified fuse ratings of 3A, 7A and 13A. The current version of the fuse standard, BS1362:1973, allows any fuse rating up to 13A, with 3A (coloured red) and 13A (coloured brown) as the preferred (but not mandated) values when used in a plug.
