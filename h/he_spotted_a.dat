5|$|To make it {{difficult}} for the enemy to track him he changed course frequently. Ranger operations depended on surprise, but it had clearly been lost. The clouds were thinning out and visibility was improving. Braham decided it was now a folly to continue and decided to head for home. While flying over Funen island <b>he</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>a</b> building with a big Swastika flag draped from a pole. A car was parked outside the entrance. Believing it might contain someone of importance, he dived to attack, strafing the building and destroyed the car.|$|E
5|$|On 15 April 1941, Galland {{took off}} with lobster and {{champagne}} to celebrate General Theo Osterkamp's birthday at Le Touquet, France. He made a detour with his wingman towards England, looking for RAF aircraft. Off the cliffs of Dover, <b>he</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>a</b> group of Spitfires. Galland attacked and claimed two confirmed and one unconfirmed shot down. The actual result was the destruction of one Spitfire; {{the other two were}} damaged in force landings with both pilots wounded. During the combat, Galland's undercarriage had dropped causing one of the RAF pilots (Flight Lieutenant Paddy Finucane) to claim Galland's aircraft as destroyed, but Galland landed without incident at Le Touquet and presented Osterkamp with his gifts. Galland's success that day represented his 60th and 61st aerial victory.|$|E
5|$|On 25July, Phillipps {{was leading}} the escort for a raid on the Lille forts east of Armentières when <b>he</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>a</b> patrol of seven Fokkers. Jettisoning his bombs to lighten his load, he {{attacked}} one of the German fighters and shot away its wing; the others retreated. During the Allies' Hundred Days Offensive, on 12August, he joined fellow No.2 Squadron ace Adrian Cole and No.4 Squadron aces Harry Cobby and Roy King to lead their combined forces {{in support of the}} British Fourth Army, Phillipps accounting for a Fokker that broke up in mid-air. He was credited with two other victories in August to bring his tally to fifteen, making him No.2 Squadron's second most successful ace after Captain Francis Smith, who finished the war with sixteen. Later that month, Phillipps rotated back to England in accordance with Royal Air Force policy, which required pilots to be rested and serve as instructors after nine to twelve months in combat. In October, he was promoted to major and posted to command No.6 (Training) Squadron at Minchinhampton; the unit was primarily responsible for training new pilots for service with No.2 Squadron.|$|E

5|$|On 28 February 1944 he {{took off}} and claimed a German lorry {{destroyed}} south of Paris in a daylight sortie. The Mosquitoes did not carry radar but were fitted with Gee navigational aids. It allowed for accurate navigation but night sorties would not be fruitful since the location of enemy aircraft would be exceptionally difficult. For Braham, hunting in daylight was a strange experience. On 5 March 1944 he flew with Bill Gregory on a 900-mile trip around northern France. The weather impeded his attempts to shoot up airfields at Orleans and Bourges, so he proceeded to the aerodrome at Châteaudun. <b>He</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>a</b> Heinkel He 177 flying in the landing circuit at 800 feet. He closed rapidly and dispatched it for his 20th air victory. Braham was denied the chance to operate as a night fighter pilot at this time when there was intense activity. In January 1944 the Luftwaffe initiated Operation Steinbock, a series of strikes against British cities {{in response to the}} British offensive over Germany. The German air arm met with severe losses during the operation.|$|E
5|$|Nine {{days later}} Braham {{returned}} to Denmark. On this occasion a No. 305 Squadron RAF Mosquito was {{borrowed from the}} Polish. On the mission he encountered a He 111 near Esjberg. It was circling a lighthouse at 300 feet. Braham fired a three-second fusillade of fire. The He 111 caught fire and nose-dived into the sea, exploding on impact. A Focke-Wulf Fw 58 trainer followed as his second victory on this mission. Meanwhile, the Germans had tracked the Mosquito by radar. Two Messerschmitt Bf 109s {{appeared on the scene}} soon afterwards. The cloud base was only at 1,000 feet and he effected his escape by hiding in its folds. One of the Bf 109s fired some ineffectual bursts of fire at Braham and he also encountered some light ground fire. He few directly to Group HQ at Benson. He returned the Mosquito the following day. Some days later, Braham returned to 305 to pick up a Mosquito and joined No. 107 Squadron RAF in a raid against Paris even though he had no formal bomber pilot training. Nine days later near Poitiers, Braham was engaged in a ground attack mission. <b>He</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>a</b> Focke-Wulf Fw 190 carrying a drop tank and under-wing rockets at low-level. He fired at 600 yards as the enemy accelerated to escape. His fire slowed the Fw 190; catching up with it, the Fw 190 was hit again and crashed: its wreckage strewn over three fields. The Focke-Wulf was his 27th victory.|$|E
5|$|There was {{evidence}} that Braham's judgement was becoming impaired. He had not taken much leave {{since the war began}} in 1939 and he admitted to becoming short-tempered with his family and those around him. He had spent much of the previous two years leading from the front and flying long and hazardous operations over enemy territory. On 7 May 1944 he collected navigator Flight Lieutenant Donald Walsh from Group headquarters. He borrowed a Mosquito from 21 Squadron at Gravesend. He flew to Norfolk to refuel and spent time with his old unit, 141 Squadron, and spent the night at West Raynham. Over Roskilde, Denmark, he caught a Ju 88 after a 10-minute chase and shot it down—his 28th victory. On 12 May Braham repeated the operation. This time he took Bill Gregory with him. Operating over the Aalborg–Copenhagen line <b>he</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>a</b> Fw 190 near Hurning. Giving chase Braham found himself under attack by a Bf 109—his presence clearly detected by German radar. His Mosquito was hit in the port wing and the fuel line were ruptured. The Bf 109 then disappeared. Ignoring the damage he closed on the Fw 190. At zero feet his Mosquito bounced off a mound but he managed to hit the enemy aircraft which burst into flames, stalled and crashed near Aalborg. The range was so close—around 100 yards—the Focke-Wulf nearly collided with Braham. The loss of fuel from the chase and damage coupled with his damaged propellers upon his collision with the ground, meant that the chances of reaching England were slim. He climbed to high altitude 70 miles from the coast and broadcast an emergency message which was received. He ditched the Mosquito which broke in half. They took the dingy and watched the tail and wings remain afloat. He was retrieved with Gregory by air-sea rescue. Royal Navy trawlers sank the sections of aircraft remaining afloat. Regardless of the venture, on 13 June 1944 he received his final award—a second bar to his DSO.|$|E

25|$|Shortly before 1pm a {{submarine}} surfaced {{ahead of the}} ships and ordered them to stop. Filey attempted to ram the submarine, which submerged but fired a torpedo at the tanker. Von Rosenberg {{reported that he had}} seen a tanker under escort by ships flying the white ensign and had seen no flag on the escorted ship. After firing the torpedo, <b>he</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>a</b> US flag on the tanker, so broke off the attack. At 12:50 an explosion took place sending a column of water into the air alongside Gulflight's starboard bow. The ship immediately started to sink and shortly the forward deck was awash. The crew abandoned ship and were taken onboard by the patrol ship Iago which turned towards St Mary island. At about 2.30 am Captain Gunter from the Gulflight was taken ill and died around 3:40 am from a heart attack. The remainder of the crew arrived at St. Mary 10 am on Sunday 2 May. The Gulflight did not sink but instead was towed to Crow Bay by patrol vessels. Ralph Smith, previously first officer, was now invited to inspect the ship, which was examined by divers and had a large hole in the starboard bow. Smith and the first engineer remained with Gulflight while the remainder of the crew were evacuated to Penzance.|$|E
25|$|Kepford's {{next big}} day arrived on 19 February. VF-17 was {{assigned}} fighter escort duty, shepherding single engine bombers to strikes on Lakunai Airfield. Kepford was again assigned as division leader, {{this time for}} one of two groups flying high cover. His wingman had engine problems and was quickly forced to return to Piva. Arriving at the target site, Kepford decided there was enough fighter cover {{and that he was}} too vulnerable without a wingman, so he too headed back for home base. En route, <b>he</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>a</b> Rufe flying low on the water. Kepford pounced on the vulnerable float plane and easily shot it down. Immediately after, a mass of 20 or so enemy fighters spotted Kepford flying alone beneath them and dove on the vulnerable pilot. He was quickly penned in by four enemy aircraft and forced to head north, away from his base. He used his plane's water injection—a new feature installed on a small number of Corsairs—to help him pull as far ahead of the enemies as possible, but the device worked fitfully. He tried to lose them flying low over land, without success. Deciding he was moving too far afield to return to base on remaining fuel reserves, Kepford quickly cut to the left and reversed direction south over the water. The plane following Kepford on the left side attempted to turn inside to shoot him down, but the pilot misjudged his altitude and struck his wing into the water below, crashing. Those on the right side lost too much ground when Kepford reversed, so they gave up the chase.|$|E
