500|$|The Narrator finds {{redemption}} {{at the end}} of {{the film}} by rejecting Tyler Durden's dialectic, a path that diverged from the novel's ending in which the Narrator is placed in a mental institution. Norton drew parallels between redemption in the film and redemption in The Graduate, indicating that the protagonists of both films find a middle ground between two divisions of self. Fincher considered the novel too infatuated with Tyler Durden and changed the ending to move away from him: [...] "I wanted people to love Tyler, but <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>wanted</b> them to be OK with his vanquishing." ...|$|E

500|$|Sholay was {{the first}} Indian film to have a {{stereophonic}} soundtrack {{and to use the}} 70mm widescreen format. However, since actual 70mm cameras were expensive at the time, the film was shot on traditional 35mm film and the 4:3 picture was subsequently converted to a 2.2:1 frame. Regarding the process, Sippy said, [...] "A 70mm [...] format takes the awe of the big screen and magnifies it even more to make the picture even bigger, but since <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>wanted</b> a spread of sound we used six-track stereophonic sound and combined it with the big screen. It was definitely a differentiator." [...] The use of 70mm was emphasised by film posters on which the name of the film was stylised to match the CinemaScope logo. Film posters also sought to differentiate the film from those which had come before; one of them added the tagline: [...] "The greatest star cast ever assembled– the greatest story ever told".|$|E

500|$|Costume {{designer}} Michele Clapton designed most of {{the newly}} introduced costumes and jewelry in [...] "The Winds of Winter". Clapton had initially left the series, but returned for the final two episodes of the season to design four different costumes. In an interview, Michele Clapton spoke about the process and meaning behind Cersei Lannister's gown and crown in the season finale. Clapton stated that she had four to five weeks to create the gown, but once she received the script for the episode, she was [...] "immediately sure" [...] of how the dress should look. She stated in the interview, [...] "I {{knew it had to}} be leather and I knew it had to be linked to Tywin. I wanted a distinct, strong silhouette, so I squared her shoulders. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>wanted</b> the dress to skim her ankles, so that you could see her feet—again, strength. The silver shoulders are decorated in a similar manner to Jaime's gold hand—the one person that she still has something with." [...] Clapton also noted that every part of the dress represents something, saying, [...] "There is no 'decoration' to Cersei." [...] She stated that she additionally chose to make the dress black in order to represent mourning, as well as a [...] "deadness inside her." ...|$|E

Donner commented, [...] "There are a few shots where Chris 's costume looked green. We went in and cleaned that up, bringing the color {{back to where it}} should be." [...] Thau wanted to make the film shorter: [...] "I wanted to take out the damn poem where Lois is reciting a poem [...] when they're flying around. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>wanted</b> to take out a lot of that car chase where it was just generic action… It was like a two-minute car chase. But Dick didn't want to take [...] out [...] the poem."

60|$|When {{appointed}} brigadier-general I at {{once thought}} it proper {{that one of}} my aides should come from the regiment I had been commanding, and so selected Lieutenant C. B. Lagow. While living in St. Louis, I had had a desk in the law office of McClellan, Moody and Hillyer. Difference in views between the members of the firm on the questions of the day, and general hard times in the border cities, had broken up this firm. Hillyer was quite a young man, then in his twenties, and very brilliant. I asked him to accept a place on my staff. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>wanted</b> to take one man from my new home, Galena. The canvass in the Presidential campaign the fall before had brought out a young lawyer by the name of John A. Rawlins, who proved himself one of the ablest speakers in the State. He was also a candidate for elector on the Douglas ticket. When Sumter was fired upon and the integrity of the Union threatened, there was no man more ready to serve his country than he. I wrote at once asking him to accept the position of assistant adjutant-general with the rank of captain, on my staff. He was about entering the service as major of a new regiment then organizing in the north-western part of the State; but he threw this up and accepted my offer.|$|E
6000|$|I {{have had}} a bad sick week, mostly in bed--with putting pen to paper quite out of my power: {{otherwise}} I should sooner have thanked you for the so generous spirit of that letter, and told you, with emotion, how much it has touched me. I am really more overcome than I can say by your having been able to indulge in such freedom of mind and grace of speculation, during these dark days, on behalf of my poor old rather truncated edition, in fact entirely frustrated one--which has the grotesque likeness for me of a sort of miniature Ozymandias of Egypt ("look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!")--round which the lone and level sands stretch further away than ever. It is indeed consenting to be waved aside a little into what was once blest literature to so much as answer the question you are so handsomely impelled to make--but my very statement about the matter can only be, alas, a melancholy, a blighted confusion. That Edition has been, {{from the point of}} view of profit either to the publishers or to myself, practically a complete failure; vaguely speaking, it doesn't sell--that is, my annual report of what it does--the whole 24 vols.--in this country amounts to about £25 from the Macmillans; and the ditto from the Scribners in the U.S. to very little more. I am past all praying for anywhere; I remain at my age (which you know,) and after my long career, utterly, insurmountably, unsaleable. And the original preparation of that collective and selective series involved really the extremity of labour--all my [...] "earlier" [...] things--of which the Bostonians would have been, if included, one--were so intimately and interestingly revised. The edition is from that point of view really a monument (like Ozymandias) which has never had the least intelligent critical justice done it--or any sort of critical attention at all paid it--and the artistic problem involved in my scheme was a deep and exquisite one, and moreover was, as I held, very effectively solved. Only it took such time--and such taste--in other words such aesthetic light. No more commercially thankless job of the literary order was (Prefaces and all--they of a thanklessness!) accordingly ever achieved. The immediate inclusion of the Bostonians was rather deprecated by the publishers (the Scribners, who were very generally and in a high degree appreciative: I make no complaint of them at all!)--and there were reasons for which <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>wanted</b> to wait: we always meant that that work should eventually come in. Revision of it loomed peculiarly formidable and time-consuming (for intrinsic reasons,) and as other things were more pressing and more promptly feasible I allowed it to stand over--with the best intentions, and also in company with a small number more of provisional omissions. But by this time it had stood over, disappointment had set in; the undertaking had begun to announce itself as a virtual failure, and we stopped short where we were--that is when a couple of dozen volumes were out. From that moment, some seven or eight years ago, nothing whatever has been added to the series--and there is little enough appearance now that there will ever. Your good impression of the Bostonians greatly moves me--the thing was no success whatever on publication in the Century (where it came out,) and the late R. W. Gilder, of that periodical, wrote me at the time that they had never published anything that appeared so little to interest their readers. I felt about it myself then that it was probably rather a remarkable feat of objectivity--but I never was very thoroughly happy about it, and seem to recall that I found the subject and the material, after I had got launched in it, under some illusion, less interesting and repaying than I had assumed it to be. All the same I should have liked to review it for the Edition--it would have come out a much truer and more curious thing (it was meant to be curious from the first;) but there can be no question of that, or of the proportionate Preface to have been written with it, at present--or probably ever within my span of life. Apropos of which matters I at this moment hear from Heinemann that four or five of my books that he has have quite (entirely) ceased to sell and that he must break up the plates. Of course he must; I have nothing to say against it; and the things in question are mostly all in the Edition. But such is [...] "success"! I should have liked to write that Preface to the Bostonians--which will never be written now. But think of noting now that that is a thing that has perished! ...|$|E
