It sits in the Caspian <b>depression,</b> 27 <b>meters</b> below sea level. The delta is growing in the {{direction}} of the sea, although annual deposits of sediment are affected by dams up-river.|$|R

50|$|The lake {{includes}} several small basins. In the western part, {{there are two}} <b>depressions</b> 7-11 <b>meters</b> deep. One of them extends from the western coast (near Tasaral Island) to Cape Korzhyntubek, whereas the second lies south from the Gulf Bertys, which is the deepest part of western Balkhash. The average depth of the eastern basin is 16 m and the maximum depth of the eastern part (and of the lake) is 26 m. The average depth of the lake is 5.8 m, and the total volume of water is about 112 km3.|$|R
50|$|The soils of {{the flats}} are heavy in texture {{and tend to}} crack widely when dry, {{becoming}} very sticky and plastic when wet. These soils are mainly black or dark gray and produce an irregular surface relief known as gilgai consisting {{of a series of}} small ridges standing 20-60 cm above circular <b>depressions</b> about 2-7 <b>meters</b> in diameter.|$|R
50|$|Sachs Patera is {{a feature}} on Venus. Defined as a sag-caldera, Sachs is an {{elliptical}} <b>depression</b> 130 <b>meters</b> (81 feet) in depth, spanning 40 km in width along its longest axis. The morphology implies that a chamber of molten material drained and collapsed, forming a depression surrounded by concentric scarps spaced 2 to 5 km apart. The arc-shaped set of scarps, extending {{out to the}} north from the prominent ellipse, is evidence for a separate episode of withdrawal; the small lobe-shaped extension to the southwest may represent an additional event. Solidified lava flows 10 to 25 km long give the caldera its flower-like appearance. The flows are a lighter tone of gray in the radar data because the lava is blockier in texture and consequently returns more radar waves. Much of the lava, which was evacuated from the chamber, probably traveled to other locations underground, while some of it may have surfaced further south. This is unlike calderas on Earth, where a rim of lava builds up {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the caldera.|$|R
2500|$|After {{a winding}} course of about , the Awash River passes (in its lower reaches) {{through a series}} of badds (lagoons) to Lake Abhe Bad (or Abhe Bid) on the border with Djibouti and some [...] from the head of the Gulf of Tadjoura. In this lake the Awash river is lost. This {{remarkable}} phenomenon is explained by the position of Abhe Bad in the centre of a saline lacustrine <b>depression</b> several hundred <b>meters</b> below sea level. While most of the other lagoons are highly saline, with thick incrustations of salt round their margins, Abhe Bad remains fresh throughout the year, owing to the great body of water discharged into it by the Awash.|$|R

The highest {{point is the}} top of the mountain Khan Tengri, on the Kyrgyz border in the Tian Shan range, with an elevation of 7,010 meters, or 21,999 feet above sea level; the lowest point is the bottom of the Karagiye <b>depression</b> at 132 <b>meters,</b> or 433 feet below sea level, in the Mangystau province east of the Caspian Sea. Most of the country lies at between 200 and 300 meters above sea level, but Kazakhstan's Caspian shore includes some of the lowest elevations on Earth. The peak Khan Tengri in the Tian Shan Mountains (and on the border with Kyrgyzstan and China) is Kazakhstan highest elevation at 6995m (7010m with ice cap).|$|R
2500|$|Augustine's summit {{consists}} of several overlapping lava dome complexes formed during many historic and prehistoric eruptions. Most of the fragmental debris exposed along its slopes [...] comprises angular blocks of dome-rock andesite, typically of cobble to boulder size but carrying clasts {{as large as}} 4 to 8 meters (10 to 25 feet), rarely as large as 30 meters (100ft). The surface of such deposits is skeet, a field of steep conical mounds and intervening <b>depressions</b> with many <b>meters</b> of local relief. En route to Katmai in 1913, Robert F. Griggs had briefly inferred landslide (debris avalanche) as the origin of Augustine's hummocky coastal topography about Burr Point, by geomorphic analogy with the hummocky and blocky deposit of a 1912 landslide near Katmai.|$|R

5000|$|... ==Flora and fauna== About {{one-third of}} the reserve is forested, mostly on the lower north slopes. The forests are mostly oak (on the Rocky Ridge and <b>depression</b> to 800 <b>meters),</b> and beech (to 1,500 meters) communities. Underbrush at the mid-level include sea {{buckthorn}} (Hippophae), willow, gray alder, and in places extensive hazel. Approaching the sub-alpine zone the brush features Caucasian rhododendron. [...] Above 2,000 meters but below the alpine zone at 2,500 meters is a belt of mountain forest-steppe: wheatgrass-wormwood-cereal xerophytic steppes on shallow meadow soils. The animal life of the reserve is still being inventories and studied, as the reserve {{is one of the}} newest in the system. As of 2016, 115 species of birds had been recorded, 60 species of mammals (15 of which were hooved, 10 were bats, and 20 were rodents).|$|R
50|$|The basin houses {{economically}} important hydrocarbon reservoirs {{that serve}} {{as a source of}} petroleum.Hydrocarbon generation in the Angola Basin is still an ongoing process that began in the late Cretaceous after the deposition of the thick salt beds.The salt is an important feature in preserving hydrocarbons as it seals in the reservoir and prevents it from escaping into the open water.Successful hydrocarbon collection within the Angola margin is associated with pockmarks within the topography that are formed as gas or subsurface water travels upwards through the water column.In December 2000 a research expedition collected gas hydrate specimens from one of the world's largest pockmarks located in the Congo-Angola Basin.The <b>depression</b> was 800 <b>meters</b> in diameter and located 3160 meters below sea level and developed as a result of several smaller pockmarks collapsing into each other.The majority of the hydrocarbons found were gas hydrates composed of 100% methane.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} done to {{identify}} the prevalence of depression and determine the relationship of body mass index and perceived health status to depression for elderly women who live alone in the community. Methods: A total of 175 adults aged over 60 participated in this cross-sectional descriptive study. Perceived heath status was measured using a self-report one-item questionnaire. Body mass index was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in <b>meters.</b> <b>Depression</b> was assessed using the Korean short version of the geriatric depression scale. Hierarchical linear regression was used to identify associations between variables. Results: Approximately 61. 7 % of elderly women who lived alone were depressed. The mean score for depression was 7. 4 (SD 3. 39). Hierarchical linear regression showed body mass index (β=. 25, p<. 001) and perceived health status (β=-. 26, p<. 001) were independently associated with depression adjusting for general characteristics. These two predictors accounted for 12 % {{of the variance in}} depression. Conclusion: These results suggest that obesity and perceived health status are risk factors for depression in elderly women living alone. Therefore, these factors should be considered when developing intervention program for elderly women wit...|$|R
40|$|Pianosa Island {{belongs to}} the Tuscany Archipelago; it has an {{extension}} of 10 km 2, 18 km of coastal development and a max altitude of 29 m a. s. l. The island {{is made up of}} neogenic and quaternary sediments; pelitic Miocene sediments outcrops {{at the base of the}} cliff in the south-western coast, while the bio-calcarenitic Pliocene sediments cover most part of the island. Quaternary deposits are established by biodetrital shore sediments of Tyrrhenian age and by Late Pleistocene colluvial deposits. The island is characterized by cliffs in the western and southern sector, by plain surfaces and by a small beach in the east side. Cliffs have been distinguished in 3 different types. In the first type is always present a developing wave notch. When the coast is not characterized by cliff we can found erosion plains (at maximum level of approximately 4 m) formed during the Tyrrhenian high stand (Isotopic stage 5 e). These erosion planes can be suspended and sub-horizontal (when the layers of the pliocenic substrate dip towards inland), or gently tilted towards sea (when the layers of the pliocenic substrate dip towards sea). On these various erosion planes are always present rock pools characterized by different shape and dimension, besides rare fossiliferous shore deposits (Panchina). In these sediments have been recognized, between others: Strombus bubonius, Patella ferruginea and Conus testudinarius, dating Tyrrhenian age. On the island we can found three different order of erosion planes at 2 - 4 m, 8 m and 25 m a. s. l. Karst process produced erosion epigean micro-landforms, such us dissolutional flutes, dissolutional groves and dissolutional pans (kamenitza), macro-landforms represented by E-W karst oval basin <b>depressions,</b> enlarged hundred <b>meters</b> and few meters deep. The same process left isolated rock promontory residual of the tyrrhenian cliffs coast lines. Much diffused are hypogean karst shape such as caves and conduits that, sometimes, are opened on the cliff and are visible only by the sea. In some of these caves, characterized by speleothemes, we discovered, at a quote of 7 m a. s. l., marine deposits and litodomes holes probably of Tyrrhenian age. Frequently is the founding of breccias breeded by collapse of caves and conduits. Surface karst landforms are widening covered by high agricoltural activity developed in the last two centuries due to the presence of the agricoltural penal colony...|$|R
40|$| domains and the {{internal}} domains of the continental margin, whose deep water meso-cenozoic carbonates formed the structurally highest tectonic units in the chain. The occurrence of intrastratal decollement originated duplex geometries. Since the Messinian, the deformation moved at depth, progressively involving the carbonate platform rock bodies in large E-W antiforms that were successively (during Late Pliocene) folded by NE- SW structures. The transpressional event is proved by NNW-SSE and NE-SW transcurrent and transpressive structures (dextral); it involves the deep-seated car- bonate platform-forming fold structures and severe uplifting that induces reimbri- cation in the overlying Imerese deep-water units. This transpressive event accom- panies the paleomagnetically evidenced thrust rotations between the Late Miocene and the Early Pleistocene. An abrupt change in the tectonic transport direction of the two compressional structure systems is explained {{taking into account the}} 120 ° clockwise rotations based on the paleomagnetic results of ChanneL et alii (1980, 1990); speranza et alii (2000). As a consequence the present day outcropping structural attitude of the structures (and consequently of the deformation fields) do not coincide with the original trends. The compressional and traspressional structures are down faulted northwards by the extensional tectonics. MARINE AREAS In the marine areas, we distinguished different morphological environments, from beaches through the offshore (inner shelf), to the outer shelf and upper slope where two confined slope basins (Palermo and Termini basins, separated by the Monte Catalfano salient) represent the south-western margin of the large Cefalù basin. The substrate of these basins is represented by the Sicilian FTB tectonic units and their syn- and post-orogenic covers. The area shows a lateral variation from the rocky shores, in front of Monte Pellegrino and Monte Catalfano and in the eastern sector, to the beaches mainly in the central sector. 190 Important physiographic changes, as shelf width and gradient and different coast orientations, characterise the continental shelf and slope and influence the hydrodynamic processes (wave activity and shelf current patterns). The continental shelf reaches 250 km 2 and shows width values ranging from 1. 5 km in the Capo Zafferano offshore to 8, 0 km in the gulf of Termini, whereas gradient values range between 1 ° and 8 °. The continental shelf has been subdi- vided into an inner infralittoral domain down to a 30 - 35 m water depth, which is characterized by an abrasion platform at different depths, and the outer shelf domain extends to the shelf edge. The shelf edge, which is both depositional and erosional, located at water depths between 120 m and 140 m, rises to lower depths at the canyon heads. Dominant morphological features along the continental slope are the submari- ne erosive conduits, locally interesting also the continental shelf. The heads of the conduits are characterised by severe episodes of retrogressive failure and incised by small gullies. Some (the Oreto and Eleuterio canyons) are directly linked to rivers and were connected during the last glacial maximum through incised val- leys, now buried by transgressive to highstand deposits. In the central sector of the Gulf of Palermo, we pinpointed almost three pockmarks, <b>depressions</b> tens of <b>meters</b> deep, originating from escaping fluids, while in the western sector of the gulf the same phenomena caused the occurrence of isolated or aligned, outcrop- ping or buried mounds. Finally anthropic features largely characterize the seabottom mainly in the inner shelf. seIsmostratIgraphy and stratIgraphIC settIng The buried sedimentary succession has been investigated by means of a close grid of single and multichannel seismic lines. On the whole, three seismic units (S, C and A) have been distinguished. The S seismic unit represents the offshore prolongation of the Meso-Cenozoic units of the Sicilian FTB and their syn- and post-orogenic cover. They are ge- nerally topped by a pronounced, erosive unconformity, correlated to the exten- sive Messinian horizon, generated during the last phases of the Mediterranean Salinity Crisis (5. 5 Ma), and covered by a transparent seismic unit representing the Globigerina - bearing pelagic chalk (Trubi) and the Upper (?) Pliocene slope to shelfal deposits. The C seismic unit is represented by a prograding succession of 4 ° to 7 ° dip- ping horizons, which have been correlated with the regressive upper Pliocene- Pleistocene deposits, topped by the regional wide, erosional truncation related to the last glacioeustatic sea level fall, correlated with the δ 18 O isotopic stage 2. The A seismic unit corresponds to the Late Pleistocene to Holocene 191 depositional sequence (SDTQ) with sigmoidal to tabular geometry; the deposi- tional sequence consists of a Falling Stage and Lowstand Systems Tracts with a progadational pattern controlling a relevant out-building of the shelf margin and a sedimentary wedge, of variable thickness, made up of the Transgressive (TST) and the Highstand (HST) Systems Tracts. The TST, developed during the Holocene sea level rise, shows a retrograda- tional stacking pattern, while the HST, deposited during the last 6 ka b. P., shows aggradational to faintly progradational geometries, related {{to the development of a}} littoral depositional system. Along the upper slope, turbiditic systems, characterized by erosive conduits and scattered mass wasting, developed extensively during the Late Pleistocene to Holocene. Surficial sediments of the continental shelf and slope The continental shelf and slope of the Palermo sheet are veneered with uncon- solidated, late Holocene in age, clastic and biogenic carbonate (Palermo gulf) and in second order, lithoclastic (Termini gulf) sediments. Deposits are composed of sands, relict Pleistocene and older carbonate parti- cles, abundant biogenic carbonate granules and algal-coated grains. In the outer shelf and upper slope, deposits are predominantly fine to very fine grained (silts and silty clays). The inner shelf is veneered by a mixture of gravel (rarely), coarse to fine sands, silts and clays, showing a general trend of decrea- sing size in a general seaward direction. From the sedimentary and the morphological features, four different depo- sitional systems have been distinguished: foreshore depositional systems, inner shelf depositional systems, outer shelf depositional systems and upper slope de- positional systems, mapped as g 8, g 19, g 21, m 2 respectively. The systems are laterally gradational and linked by a variety of sedimentary processes. Shallow marine environments (up to a 50 m water depth) are generally characterized by biogenic sediments while terrigenous and carbonate clastic sedi- ments supplied by rivers or coastal erosion locally prevail. The most important facies of the infralittoral domain consists of Posidonia oceanica and Cymodocea nodosa meadows, which extensively cover the rocky substrate or the sandy floors the former and the muddy floors the latter. teCtonIC evoLutIon of the offshore areas The present day structural setting reconstructed in the Palermo sheet marine sectors appears the same as the tectonic edifice depicted on the mainland: it has 192 been interpreted as a consequence of the complex Neogene to Quaternary tectonic evolution. The compressive tectonics, responsible for the wedging of the present day submerged thrust sheets, developed during the Late Miocene span interval. This event was followed by transpressive tectonics that faulted and folded the Late Neogene to Pliocene infill by activation of high-angle, deep faults. During the Pleistocene, extensional tectonics accounted for opening and subsidence of structural lows. Present day active tectonics is still going on, as documented by compressive- transpressive focal mechanisms of shallow to deep, low amplitude earthquakes occurring along the offshore between the Sicilian coast and Ustica Island. A few middle-late Pleistocene marine terraces, outcropping along the coast at different levels, suggest a prolonged, faintly tectonic uplift. On the whole, the Plio-Quaternary geological evolution of the offshore area appears to be constrained by a strong interaction between eustatic sea level chan- ges, sediment supply and tectonics, recorded by strain features and enhanced un- conformities crossing the basin fill...|$|R
