40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{examination}} {{and analysis of}} the role of law enforcement in the transformation of a city 2 ̆ 7 s downtown from one dominated by sleazy strip bars and prostitutes to one of family entertainment. The focus is on the police and prosecutors; however, {{a substantial portion of the}} thesis discusses the role of Newport, Kentucky 2 ̆ 7 s, City Commission. The thesis chronicles Newport 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>vice</b> history from early Prohibition through the early 1990 s and the impact of city government upon anti-vice efforts becomes evident, but law enforcement that paved the way. The approach is chronological. Newport 2 ̆ 7 s transformation was an evolutionary process. Elected officials influenced the city 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>vice</b> problems, but state legislative changes and United States Supreme Court cases also had a part in the course of anti-vice efforts. Changes in the law and court cases often gave city officials and law enforcement direction in the regulation and prosecution of illegal vices...|$|R

V druhé kapitole jsem se zaměřil na souvislosti RAW formátu a HDR fotografie <b>s</b> grafikou <b>s</b> <b>více</b> bity na kanál. V třetí kapitole jsem testoval programy na tvorbu a úpravu grafiky. Ve čtvrté kapitole jsem popisoval základní pojmy důležité pro fotografování. V páté kapitole jsem popsal principy CRT a LCD monitorů a nevýhody zobrazení grafiky <b>s</b> <b>více</b> bity na kanál na nich. V poslední kapitole jsem provedl několik testů vybraných fotoaparátů podporující RAW formát. This {{piece of}} work deals with {{problems}} of graphics application with more bits for a channel and with a comprehension of this graphics base. An inseparable component is a description of more-bits graphics and its use. Next there are given and described colourful models and spaces, because knowledge of this problem is important for understanding these graphics. In one part of this work I concerned with connection of more-bits graphics to photographs with high dynamic range (HDR) and RAW format, which is elaborately described, but substantiated with my own photographs as well. I also did testing of chosen programmes for work with graphics, which allow more bits system. First of all I was interested in possibilities in given graphics editor and I did a comparison of these programmes. There are explained important ideas for photography, which should be known by every advanced or professional photographer. I included a basic principle description of LCD and CRT monitors, disadvantages of morebits graphic display on different types of monitors and give {{an example of a}} 10 bit monitor. In the end of the work I tested chosen cameras supporting RAW format. I tested both professional and amateur digital reflex cameras. I made a comparison of individual parameters of those cameras. I have done a test, which is based on taken photographs from one place by using digital reflex camera supporting RAW format, digital compact camera and mobile phone and then I compared values of final photographs...|$|R
