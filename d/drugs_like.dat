5|$|Biotechnology in {{the general}} sense has been an {{important}} part of biology since the late 19th century. With the industrialization of brewing and agriculture, chemists and biologists became aware of the great potential of human-controlled biological processes. In particular, fermentation proved a great boon to chemical industries. By the early 1970s, a wide range of biotechnologies were being developed, from <b>drugs</b> <b>like</b> penicillin and steroids to foods like Chlorella and single-cell protein to gasohol—as well as a wide range of hybrid high-yield crops and agricultural technologies, the basis for the Green Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Concerning drugs, Paul {{has criticized}} {{mandatory}} minimums {{that he believes}} have led to unreasonably harsh sentences for repeat offenders. He has highlighted the case of Timothy L. Tyler as particularly unfair. Paul {{does not believe in}} legalizing the recreational use of <b>drugs</b> <b>like</b> marijuana and cocaine, but does not support jailing marijuana users. He supports state laws to legalize the use of marijuana for medical purposes. Paul was one of three U.S. senators in 2015 to introduce a bipartisan bill, CARERS, that would legalize medical marijuana under federal law.|$|E
5|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} industry has {{roots in the}} apothecary shops of Europe in the 1800s, where pharmacists provided local traditional medicines to customers, which included extracts like morphine, quinine, and strychnine. Therapeutically important <b>drugs</b> <b>like</b> camptothecin (from Camptotheca acuminata, used in traditional Chinese medicine) and taxol (from the Pacific yew, Taxus brevifolia) were derived from medicinal plants. The Vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, used as anti-cancer drugs, were discovered in the 1950s from the Madagascar periwinkle, Catharanthus roseus.|$|E

50|$|A phase III human abuse {{potential}} {{study found}} that all dosages of ALKS-5461 tested did not share the abuse potential of buprenorphine, and no difference in <b>drug</b> <b>liking</b> for ALKS-5461 was observed relative to placebo.|$|R
5|$|Cynthia {{knew her}} husband took <b>drugs</b> <b>like</b> Preludin, and {{regularly}} smoked cannabis but {{thought of them}} as not being very dangerous. On 27 March 1965, {{at a dinner party}} given by a dentist, John Riley, the Lennons, Harrison, and Boyd were given LSD without their knowledge. Although told not to leave the house, Harrison drove them to various nightclubs, with Riley following them by taxi. At the Ad Lib club, they thought the lift up to the club was on fire and started screaming, before finally crawling out of the lift for which Mick Jagger, Marianne Faithfull, and Starr were waiting. Harrison later drove them back home in Boyd's Mini Cooper at no more than 10mph, as he was also feeling the effects of the drug. They stayed up all night at Kenwood, experiencing the full effects of their first LSD trip.|$|E
5|$|The use of bone {{building}} <b>drugs,</b> <b>like</b> bisphosphonates and anti-RANKL drugs {{require special}} consideration with implants, {{because they have}} been associated with a disorder called Bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ). The drugs change bone turnover, which is thought to put people at risk for death of bone when having minor oral surgery. At routine doses (for example, those used to treat routine osteoporosis) the effects of the drugs linger for months or years but the risk appears to be very low. Because of this duality, uncertainty exists in the dental community about how to best manage the risk of BRONJ when placing implants. A 2009 position paper by the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons, discussed that the risk of BRONJ from low dose oral therapy (or slow release injectable) as between 0.01 and 0.06 percent for any procedure done on the jaws (implant, extraction, etc.). The risk is higher with intravenous therapy, procedures on the lower jaw, people with other medical issues, those on steroids, those on more potent bisphosphonates and people who have taken the drug for more than three years. The position paper recommends against placing implants in people who are taking high dose or high frequency intravenous therapy for cancer care. Otherwise, implants can generally be placed and the use of bisphosphonates does not appear to affect implant survival.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>drug</b> <b>like</b> {{fentanyl}} is very fat soluble. Initial doses ‘wear off’ relatively {{quickly because}} the drug redistributes to adipose tissue. However, if the infusion is ongoing then the peripheral compartment (body tissue) {{will have a}} large store of fentanyl ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} delta 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol content of {{marijuana}} on cigarette smoking, dose choice, and verbal report of drug "liking" by adult males {{living in a}} residential laboratory were investigated. Marijuana cigarettes were available during programmed intervals while subjects were engaged in recreational activities. The tetrahydrocannabinol content of the cigarettes remained constant each day, but was changed across days. Subjects provided written ratings of <b>drug</b> <b>liking</b> {{at the end of}} each day. In the first study, placebo or active (2. 3 % delta 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol) marijuana cigarettes were available for 1 -, 2 -, or 3 -day intervals at varying times of day. The number of cigarettes smoked was unrelated to tetrahydrocannabinol content, although verbal reports of <b>drug</b> <b>liking</b> were consistently higher when marijuana cigarettes containing tetrahydrocannabinol were smoked. In a second study, a choice procedure, consisting of four 3 -day blocks of 2 sample days and 1 choice day, was used. On sampling days, subjects smoked cigarettes varying in tetrahydrocannabinol content (0. 0, 2. 0, and 3. 5 %, w/w); on choice days they were allowed to choose between the two previously sampled doses. The number of cigarettes was not consistently related to tetrahydrocannabinol content. Ratings of <b>drug</b> <b>liking</b> were increased when marijuana cigarettes contained tetrahydrocannabinol, but ratings of marijuana containing 2. 0 % and 3. 5 % of the compound were similar. In contrast, subjects consistently chose the 3. 5 % dose over either the 0. 0 % or 2. 0 % dose. Dose choice was more sensitive to tetrahydrocannabinol content than either reports of <b>drug</b> <b>liking</b> or numbers of cigarettes smoked...|$|R

25|$|Stimulants, which inhibit sleep, include caffeine, an {{adenosine}} antagonist; amphetamine, MDMA, empathogen-entactogens, {{and related}} drugs; cocaine, which {{can alter the}} circadian rhythm, and methylphenidate, which acts similarly; and other analeptic <b>drugs</b> <b>like</b> Modafinil and Armodafinil with poorly understood mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also an}} {{increase}} in the number and affinity of glucocorticoid receptors. Levels of corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) and albumin, which normally bind cortisol, are decreased, resulting in increased levels of free cortisol.

50|$|If at {{any time}} in tilt table testing a patient loses consciousness, he or she will be {{returned}} to a supine or head down position and will be given immediate medical attention, which could include being given fluids or perhaps atropine or a sympathomimetic <b>drug</b> <b>like</b> epinephrine or ephedrine which will raise blood pressure and heart rate rapidly.|$|R
40|$|Cefoperazone A, the {{principal}} metabolite of cefoperazone, {{was found to}} have an antimicrobial activity ranging from slightly below to 16 -fold less than that of the parent <b>drug.</b> <b>Like</b> cefoperazone, the metabolite is bactericidal, penetrates well into bacterial cells, and has moderate beta-lactamase stability, some strains of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae produce an inoculum effect on the metabolite activity...|$|R
25|$|Unlike ciprofloxacin, {{levofloxacin}} {{does not}} appear to deactivate the drug metabolizing enzyme CYP1A2. Therefore, drugs that use that enzyme, like theophylline, do not interact with levofloxacin. It is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9, suggesting potential to block the breakdown of warfarin and phenprocoumon. This can result in more action of <b>drugs</b> <b>like</b> warfarin, leading to more potential side effects, such as bleeding.|$|E
25|$|Surgical removal is {{the usual}} {{treatment}} for GH-producing tumors. In some circumstances, focused radiation or a GH antagonist such as pegvisomant may be employed to shrink the tumor or block function. Other <b>drugs</b> <b>like</b> octreotide (somatostatin agonist) and bromocriptine (dopamine agonist) {{can be used to}} block GH secretion because both somatostatin and dopamine negatively inhibit GHRH-mediated GH release from the anterior pituitary.|$|E
25|$|This {{inhibition}} of MAO-A allows DMT to diffuse unmetabolized past the membranes {{in the stomach}} and small intestine, and eventually cross the blood–brain barrier (which, by itself, requires no MAO-A inhibition) to activate receptor sites in the brain. Without RIMAs or the non-selective, nonreversible monoamine oxidase inhibition by <b>drugs</b> <b>like</b> phenelzine and tranylcypromine, DMT would be oxidized (and thus rendered biologically inactive) by monoamine oxidase enzymes in the digestive tract.|$|E
40|$|Nucleic acid are {{involved}} in fundamental biological functions as propagation of the genetic material, storage of genetic information and enzymatic activity.

50|$|Colcemid is a microtubule-depolymerizing <b>drug</b> <b>like</b> vinblastine. It acts by two {{distinct}} mechanisms. At very low concentration it binds to microtubule plus end to suppress microtubule dynamics. Recent study has found at higher concentration colcemid can promote microtubule detachment from microtubule organizing center. Detached microtubules with unprotected minus ends depolymerize with time. Cytotoxicity {{of the cells}} seems to correlate better with microtubule detachment. Lower concentrations affect microtubule dynamics and cell migration.|$|R
30|$|The specs {{database}} {{was first}} screened for <b>drug</b> <b>like</b> properties using Lipinski rule of 5 and Veber rule. The remaining 75671 compounds were secondly {{built as a}} 3 D database in DS 4.0. Hypo 4 {{was used as the}} model to screen the potential FXa inhibitors using DS 4.0. As a result, the 10000 compounds with top scores during the pharmacophore based virtual screening were selected for the further molecular docking.|$|R
25|$|Psychological {{disorders}} {{like that}} of {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD) can be treated with <b>drugs</b> <b>like</b> methylphenidate (also known as Ritalin), which block the re-uptake of dopamine by the pre-synaptic cell, thereby providing an increase of dopamine left in the synaptic gap. This increase in synaptic dopamine will increase binding to receptors of the post-synaptic cell. This same mechanism is also used by other illegal and more potent stimulant drugs such as cocaine.|$|E
25|$|DCC is {{expressed}} {{at very low}} levels {{through most of the}} body but at higher levels {{in many areas of the}} brain, particularly in dopamine neurons. Recently it has been shown that a sensitizing treatment regimen of amphetamines causes markedly increased levels of DCC and UNC-5 expression on neuron cell bodies. This may indicate that netrin-1 receptors are involved in the lasting effects of exposure to stimulant <b>drugs</b> <b>like</b> amphetamine, and may have some therapeutic value in the field of drug tolerance.|$|E
25|$|Consuming food {{prior to}} taking {{chlorpromazine}} orally limits its absorption, likewise cotreatment with benztropine can also reduce chlorpromazine absorption. Alcohol can also reduce chlorpromazine absorption. Antacids slow chlorpromazine absorption. Lithium and chronic treatment with barbiturates can increase chlorpromazine clearance significantly. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) can decrease chlorpromazine clearance and hence increase chlorpromazine exposure. Cotreatment with CYP1A2 inhibitors like ciprofloxacin, fluvoxamine or vemurafenib can reduce chlorpromazine clearance and hence increase exposure and potentially also adverse effects. Chlorpromazine can also potentiate the CNS depressant effects of <b>drugs</b> <b>like</b> barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, lithium and anaesthetics and hence increase {{the potential for}} adverse effects such as respiratory depression and sedation.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of techniques for efficient peptide production {{renewed interest in}} peptides as therapeutics. Numerous modifications for improving stability, transport and affinity profiles now exist. Several new adjuvant and carrier systems have also been developed, enhancing the immunogenicity of peptides thus allowing their development as vaccines. This review describes the established and experimental approaches for manufacturing peptide drugs and highlights the techniques currently used for improving their <b>drug</b> <b>like</b> properties...|$|R
50|$|In {{sports a}} masking agent {{is used to}} hide or prevent {{detection}} of a banned substance or illegal <b>drug</b> <b>like</b> anabolic steroids or stimulants. Diuretics are the simplest form of masking agent and work by enhancing water loss via urine excretion and thus diluting the urine, which results in lower concentrations of the banned substance as more of it is being excreted from the body {{making it more difficult}} for laboratories to detect.|$|R
50|$|Matched {{molecular}} pair analysis (MMPA) is {{a method}} in cheminformatics whereby the pedigree of structural changes, within <b>drug</b> <b>like</b> small molecules, is established based on real measured data. The term was first coined by Kenny and Sadowski in the book Chemoinformatics in Drug Discovery. The basic notion of MMPA based analysis is analyzing chemical data sets dealing with pairs of compounds. Such pairs of compounds are known as matched molecular pairs (MMP).|$|R
