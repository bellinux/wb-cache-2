The robust bang-bang control law for stabilization the bilinear system is elaborated. The key feature of the closed loop controller is the efficiency for different types of initial excitement.

40|$|Abstract. As final {{component}} of coextrusion system in polymer industry to produce product with multi-layer different materials, the coextrusion-die {{can be regarded}} as the most important determinant that can influence product quality directly. For design of die-cave that can make uniform pressure and speed distribution for different materials, geometry structure of die-cave and rheology performances of materials must be taken into consideration. In order to reduce the influence of operation uncertainty of polymer extrusion, <b>damping</b> <b>block</b> {{can be used to make}} adjustment for flowing speed of different materials.

40|$|Temporal {{resolution}} in an ultrasonic {{system may be}} enhanced by the application of mechanical damping to the transducer rear face, thereby reducing internal reverberation and increasing effective bandwidth. However, for thickness drive transducers, this is accompanied inevitably by a reduction in sensitivity and, moreover, manufacture of suitable <b>damping</b> <b>blocks</b> can be difficult, particularly for lower frequency, small signal applications such as the detection of gas coupled ultrasound. This work describes an interesting alternative approach that utilizes the relatively strong coupling between the fundamental thickness mode and first lateral mode in 1 - 3 connectivity piezocomposite transducers. Finite elementmodeling is {{used to evaluate the}} influence of mode interaction on electromechanical coupling efficiency, surface displacement, sensitivity, and bandwidth as functions of the ceramic pillar dimensions for operation into both water and air load media. A range of composite devices was constructed and close agreement between theory and experiment is demonstrated, with a measured device bandwidth of 130 % centered at 1. 15 MHz. An example of using such a device within a gas-coupled ultrasonic system is presented and the response is shown to compare favorably with alternative transducer configurations...|$|R

40|$|Although {{the cost}} of solar {{technology}} has been reduced by nearly seventy {{percent in the last}} ten years, {{the cost of}} implementing solar panels for residential and commercial use has remained stagnant. Due to the lack of affordable, easily installable solar panel systems on residential properties, the goal of our Senior Design Project is to design a stand-alone solar tracking structure. Since the system is stand-alone, it can be easily implemented {{on a wide range of}} properties in most areas of California. Our design for the support of the solar tracking system is a two-pole structure, with a wide base under each pole to eliminate the need for a deep foundation. An electric gearmotor system will drive the rotational motion of the solar tracking function, due to its high power output and relatively affordable cost. A hydraulic <b>damping</b> and <b>blocking</b> system was incorporated to precisely control rotational motion. After testing the system for both tracking and static operation, an 11. 4 % increase power production was observed.

40|$|Pilocarpine, a muscarinic {{acetylcholine}} receptor (mAChR) agonist, {{is widely used}} for treatment of xerostomia and glaucoma. It can also cause many other cellular responses by activating different subtypes of mAChRs in different tissues. However, the potential role of pilocarpine in modulating cardiac function remained unstudied. We found that pilocarpine produced concentration-dependent (0. 1 – 10 [*]μM) decrease in sinus rhythm and action potential duration, and hyperpolarization of membrane potential in guinea-pig hearts. The effects were nearly completely reversed by 1 [*]μM atropine or 2 [*]nM 4 DAMP methiodide (an M 3 -selective antagonist). Patch-clamp recordings in dispersed myocytes from guinea-pig and canine atria revealed that pilocarpine induces a novel K+ current with delayed rectifying properties. The current was suppressed by low concentrations of M 3 -selective antagonists 4 DAMP methiodide (2 – 10 [*]nM), 4 DAMP mustard (4 – 20 [*]nM, an ackylating agent) and p-F-HHSiD (20 – 200 [*]nM). Antagonists towards other subtypes (M 1, M 2 or M 4) all failed to alter the current. The affinity of pilocarpine (KD) at mAChRs derived from displacement binding of [3 H]-NMS in the homogenates from dog atria was 2. 2 [*]μM (65 % of the total binding) and that of 4 DAMP methiodide was 2. 8 [*]nM (70 % of total binding), consistent with the concentration of pilocarpine needed for the current induction and for the modulation of the cardiac electrical activity and the concentration of 4 <b>DAMP</b> to <b>block</b> pilocarpine effects.

40|$|The Cal Poly Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Department was donated a {{fume hood}} {{so that it}} could be used for {{educational}} purposes in the lab. The fume hood was not fully set up and only ran in a constant volume mode; the fan ran at full speed with no feedback to reduce air flow. A fume hood can be opened or closed using the sash; air flowing through the sash opening must always be above a certain speed. As the sash is closed the opening grows smaller and the speed of the air increases. Two additional modes of operation were designed that reduced the flow of air with the reduction of sash opening: a <b>damper</b> system that <b>blocks</b> the flow of excess air, and a variable frequency drive system that reduces the fan speed.

40|$|Mechanical {{ventilation}} (MV) has {{the potential}} to worsen pre-existing lung injury or even to initiate lung injury. Moreover, it is thought that injurious MV contributes to the overwhelming inflammatory response seen in patients with acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) is characterized by increased endothelial and epithelial permeability and pulmonary inflammation, in which the innate immune system plays a key role. A growing body of evidence indicates that endogenous danger molecules, also termed damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), are released upon tissue injury and modulate the inflammatory response. DAMPs activate pattern recognition receptors, may induce the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and have been shown to initiate or propagate inflammation in non-infectious conditions. Experimental and clinical studies demonstrate the presence of DAMPs in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in patients with VILI and the upregulation of pattern recognition receptors in lung tissue by MV. The objective of the present article is to review {{research in the area of}} DAMPs, their recognition by the innate immune system, their role in VILI, and the potential utility of <b>blocking</b> <b>DAMP</b> signaling pathways to reduce VILI in the critically il...|$|R
5000|$|Arsenate esters, such {{as those}} that would be present in DNA, are {{generally}} expected to be orders of magnitude less stable to hydrolysis than corresponding phosphate esters. dAMAs, the structural arsenic analog of the DNA building <b>block</b> <b>dAMP,</b> has a half-life of 40 minutes in water at neutral pH. Estimates of the half-life in water of arsenodiester bonds, which would link the nucleotides together, are as short as 0.06 seconds—compared to 30 million years for the phosphodiester bonds in DNA. The authors speculate that the bacteria may stabilize arsenate esters to a degree by using poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (which {{has been found to be}} elevated in [...] "vacuole-like regions" [...] of related species of the genus Halomonas) or other means to lower the effective concentration of water. Polyhydroxybutyrates are used by many bacteria for energy and carbon storage under conditions when growth is limited by elements other than carbon, and typically appear as large waxy granules closely resembling the [...] "vacuole-like regions" [...] seen in GFAJ-1 cells. The authors present no mechanism by which insoluble polyhydroxybutyrate may lower the effective concentration of water in the cytoplasm sufficiently to stabilize arsenate esters. Although all halophiles must reduce the water activity of their cytoplasm by some means to avoid desiccation, the cytoplasm always remains an aqueous environment.|$|R
40|$|The Wing and Rotor Aeroelastic Test System (WRATS) data {{acquisition}} system (DAS) is a 64 -channel {{data acquisition}} display and analysis system specifically designed for use with the WRATS 1 / 5 -scale V- 22 tiltrotor model of the Bell Osprey. It is the primary {{data acquisition system}} for experimental aeroelastic testing of the WRATS model {{for the purpose of}} characterizing the aeromechanical and aeroelastic stability of prototype tiltrotor configurations. The WRATS DAS was also used during aeroelastic testing of Bell Helicopter Textron s Quad-Tiltrotor (QTR) design concept, a test which received international attention. The LabVIEW-based design is portable and capable of powering and conditioning over 64 channels of dynamic data at sampling rates up to 1, 000 Hz. The system includes a 60 -second circular data archive, an integrated model swashplate excitation system, a moving <b>block</b> <b>damping</b> application for calculation of whirl flutter mode subcritical damping, a loads and safety monitor, a pilot-control console display, data analysis capabilities, and instrumentation calibration functions. Three networked computers running custom-designed LabVIEW software acquire data through National Instruments data acquisition hardware. The aeroelastic model (see figure) was tested with the DAS at two facilities at NASA Langley, the Transonic Dynamics Tunnel (TDT) and the Rotorcraft Hover Test Facility (RHTF). Because of the need for seamless transition between testing at these facilities, DAS is portable. The software is capable of harmonic analysis of periodic time history data, Fast Fourier Transform calculations, power spectral density calculations, and on-line calibration of test instrumentation. DAS has a circular buffer archive to ensure critical data is not lost in event of model failure/incident, as well as a sample-and-hold capability for phase-correct time history data...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: This review {{aimed to}} take stock of the current status of {{research}} on damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) protein. We discuss the Janus-faced role of DAMP molecules in inflammation, cancer, and tissue repair. The high-mobility group box (HMGB) - 1 and adenosine triphosphate proteins are well-known DAMP molecules and have been primarily associated with inflammation. However, as we shall see, recent data have linked these molecules to tissue repair. HMGB 1 is associated with cancer-related inflammation. It activates nuclear factor kB, which is involved in cancer regulation via its receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), Toll-like receptors 2 and 4. Proinflammatory activity and tissue repair may lead to pharmacologic intervention, by <b>blocking</b> <b>DAMP</b> RAGE and Toll like receptor 2 and 4 role in inflammation and by increasing their concentration in tissue repair, respectively. METHODS: We conducted a MEDLINE search for articles pertaining to the various issues related to DAMP, and we discuss the most relevant articles especially (ie, not only those published in journals with a higher impact factor). FINDINGS: A cluster of remarkable articles on DAMP have appeared in the literature in recent years. Regarding inflammation, several strategies have been proposed to target HMGB 1, from antibodies to recombinant box A, which interacts with RAGE, competing with the full molecule. In tissue repair, it was reported that the overexpression of HMGB 1 or the administration of exogenous HMGB 1 significantly increased the number of vessels and promoted recovery in skin-wound, ischemic injury. IMPLICATIONS: Due to the bivalent nature of DAMP, {{it is often difficult to}} explain the relative role of DAMP in inflammation versus its role in tissue repair. However, this point is crucial as DAMP-related treatments move into clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|Human {{neutrophils}} exhibit multiple {{increases in}} cytosolic free calcium concentration [(Ca 2 +]i) spontaneously {{and in response}} to the chemoattractant N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (Jaconi, M. E. E., R. W. Rivest, W. Schlegel, C. B. Wollheim, D. Pittet, and P. D. Lew. 1988. J. Biol. Chem. 263 : 10557 - 10560). The function of these repetitive increases in [Ca 2 +]i, as well as the role of Ca 2 + in human neutrophil migration, remain unresolved. We have used microspectrofluorometry to measure [Ca 2 +]i in single fura- 2 -loaded human neutrophils as they moved on poly-D-lysine-coated glass in the presence of serum. To investigate the role of Ca 2 + in human neutrophil migration, we examined cells in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca 2 +, as well as intracellular Ca 2 (+) -buffered and Ca 2 (+) - depleted cells. In the presence of extracellular Ca 2 +, multiple increases and decreases in [Ca 2 +]i were frequently observed, and at least one such transient increase in [Ca 2 +]i occurred in every moving cell during chemokinesis, chemotaxis, and phagocytosis. In addition, neutrophils that extended pseudopodia and assumed a polarized morphology after plating onto a surface were always observed to exhibit [Ca 2 +]i transients {{even in the absence of}} chemoattractant. In contrast, a [Ca 2 +]i transient was observed in only one of the nonpolarized stationary cells that were examined (n = 15). Although some cells exhibited relatively periodic increases and decreases in [Ca 2 +]i, resembling the regular oscillations that have been observed in some cell types, many others exhibited increases and decreases in [Ca 2 +]i that varied in their timing, magnitude, and duration. Buffering of [Ca 2 +]i or removal of extracellular Ca 2 + <b>damped</b> out or <b>blocked</b> transient increases in [Ca 2 +]i and reduced or inhibited the migration of neutrophils. Under these conditions, polarized cells were often observed to make repeated attempts at migration, but they remained anchored at their rear. These data suggest that transient increases in [Ca 2 +]i may be required for the migration of human neutrophils on poly- D-lysine-coated glass in the presence of serum by allowing them to release from previous sites of attachment...|$|R
40|$|Experience {{shows that}} the noise and sound quality in {{vehicles}} are often a recurring criticism. The bodies of modern vehicles consist predominantly of thin sheets of metal. It is hard to prevent the excitation of bending vibrations and the subsequent emission of disturbing noise while driving. The noise spectrum in a car that can be heard by the driver is from ”latent roar” to ”chattering” noise {{of the body and}} engine. In automotive vehicles damped materials, especially plastics or materials made from sheet metal and surface damping treatments, are used. Those have high internal energy losses and damp sound oscillatory systems found in the body or interior of cars. A further advantage of such treated components is that they are applied to existing components working over wide temperature and frequency ranges. Many companies provide such ”sound-absorbing compounds”. The requirements for these damping materials are high temperature-resistance, water repellence, fuel and oil-resistance and good adhesion to the base material [17]. The acoustic properties, especially the damping of the plate vibrations through rubber are of interest. the question arises how can the damping coeficient of coated metal sheets can be measured and secondly, by how much the road noise is reduced when built-in sheets are coated with a known damped material. With the Oberst Bar Test Method (named after Dr. H. Oberst) the properties are determined of the internal damping materials {{that can be used to}} simulate mechanical constructions to determine damping of larger surfaces. This method describes a laboratory test procedure for measuring the mechanical properties of <b>damped</b> materials. A <b>block</b> diagram of the test system consisting of a damped material bonded to a vibrating cantilever steel bar is shown in figure 2. 1. This method is useful for testing materials such as metals, enamels, ceramics, rubbers, plastics, reinforced epoxy matrices and wood. In addition to damping measurement, the test allows for the determination of the Young’s modulus E of the material. E is calculated from the resonance frequency of a given mode and from the physical constants of the bar. By associating the damping factor with the Young’s modulus, a complex quantity is defined which is called the Complex Modulus of Elasticity. Measurements of dynamic mechanical properties are also useful in the research on the molecular structure of materials...|$|R
