25|$|Roast Beef's {{birthday}} is April 22. Some of his accomplishments include {{a program that}} determines how many eggs and how much milk you need to buy in a given week, and another that determines the amount of loose change lying around your house and makes a reservation at a restaurant accordingly. Roast Beef is partial to UNIX and his preferred programming language is Java. He likes Stella Artois beer and Guinness. He is perhaps the world's greatest historian of the Great Outdoor Fight, and drove Ray to compete (and win) in the 2006 Fight. He also managed {{to get into the}} Fight himself by hacking the Fight's database. He fully accepted the fact that Ray would have to beat him senseless in order to win, and was shocked beyond belief when Ray destroyed the Fight rather than fight him. He drives a 1965 Ford Galaxie (powered by Ford's rare 427 SOHC V8 engine) that was a gift from Ray. He has also gone to the moon, by stealing Pat's home-made rocket, and to the afterlife (both heaven and hell), via various methods including some of the aforementioned shooting incidents and vomiting into an electrical outlet. He has also produced his very own zine, titled Man Why You Even Got To <b>Do</b> <b>A</b> <b>Thing.</b>|$|E
500|$|He later {{changed his}} mind about capital punishment, {{regarding}} it as unethical. In 1984 he wrote [...] "Is it right for us, as a society, to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> – hang a man – which none of us individually would be prepared to do or even witness? The answer is 'no, not in a civilised society'".|$|E

In an Entertainment Weekly interview before the episode aired, Sapochnik said he was brought on board by Benioff and Weiss after his previous-season success; [...] "Hardhome" [...] won several awards, including Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards. About how the episode should be shot, he said: [...] "Every battle on Thrones is unique. I think that's why Benioff and Weiss keep doing them. In the case of 'Battle of the Bastards' – or 'BOB' as we affectionately called it in production – David and Dan wanted to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> of spectacle, a strategic pitchfield battle they hadn't had the resources to do back in season 1 or 2. I was particularly interested in depicting both the horror {{of war and the}} role of luck in battle." [...] Benioff called Sapochnik's work on the episode some {{of the best in the}} series' history.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Greg Hernandez, Mills explained: [...] "I {{knew that she was}} going to be a trouble maker but actually knowing the writers and the producers, I knew that the character would be rounded and have dimension and that was really fun for me to play. It wasn’t one-note all the time, it was a lot of different colors." [...] Television personality Julie Chen said, [...] "The women of Knots, Michele Lee, Joan Van Ark, and Donna Mills have been compared to earth, wind, and fire, with Donna Mills bringing the heat as Abby, the conniving vixen that everybody loved to hate." [...] According to Mills, many people were wary of meeting her in person because they assumed she would be like Abby. She said, [...] "They were very trepedacious about what I was going to do." [...] Mike Celizic of NBC said that her character was [...] "the archetypal predatory female", while Meredith Vieira said [...] "even the bad girl could show a tender side every once in a while", in reference to her daughter's on-screen drug addiction. It was this very storyline that showed Abby at her most vulnerable and human, a story which audiences recall as perhaps one of her most desperate and motherly of moments. In addition to that, Abby also helped Val get her kidnapped babies back, even though she was blamed she said she [...] "could never <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> like that to anyone". When Karen and Mack began to have some problems in their marriage and Karen distanced herself from Mack, Abby confronted Karen aggressively and told her she was wrong for doing so to him.|$|E

The court martial went into an in camera session while sensitive evidence was being heard. Lody claimed that he had asked in August to be erased from military service on the grounds of poor health and to be allowed to travel to the United States. This was refused, he went on, but a member of naval intelligence whom he had previously never met coaxed him into undertaking a mission in the UK on the condition that he could go to the US afterwards. Lody told the tribunal that he was not pressured but that [...] "I have never been a coward in my life and I certainly would not be a shirker", and that he had persisted with his mission because [...] "once a man has promised to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> he does it, that is the understanding." [...] His services were provided [...] "absolutely as an honour and free", while he had never intended to be a spy: [...] "I was pressed for secret service, but not as a spy– oh, no. If that would have been mentioned to me at Berlin I surely would have refused. The word in the sentence, I do not think it goes together." [...] He claimed that he had [...] "pledged my word of honour" [...] not to name his controller.|$|E

2500|$|Bickerdyke {{also worked}} closely with Eliza Emily Chappell Porter of Chicago's Northwestern branch of the United States Sanitary Commission. She later worked on the first {{hospital}} boat. During the war, she became chief of nursing {{under the command of}} General Ulysses S. Grant, and served at the Battle of Vicksburg. [...] As chief of nursing, Bickerdyke sometimes deliberately ignored military procedure, and when Grant's staff complained about her behavior, Union Gen. William T. Sherman reportedly threw up his hands and exclaimed, [...] "She outranks me. I can't <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> in the world." [...] Sherman acknowledged that she was [...] "one of his best generals" [...] and other officers referred to her as the [...] "Brigadier Commanding Hospitals." [...] Sherman was especially fond of this volunteer nurse, who followed the western armies. Bickerdyke held the favor of both General Sherman and General Grant, who often provided her whatever she requested of them.|$|E
2500|$|Although the Three Oaths were {{obligatory}} in the past, the gentiles violated their vow by excessively persecuting the Jewish people. Therefore, {{the validity}} of the two other vows has been nullified. Religious Zionists point to a specific Midrash warning that if gentile nations violated this oath, then [...] "they cause the End of Days to come prematurely." [...] This has been interpreted to mean that Israel's re-establishment would be implemented sooner than originally intended. With atrocities against Jews throughout history, and especially after The Holocaust, the Jewish people were absolved of their part of the Oaths. Those who hold this position often rely on the Shulchan Aruch which states: [...] "two [...] who have taken an oath to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing,</b> and one of them violates the oath, the other is exempt [...] and does not require permission." [...] As a result, the ban on mass-immigration to the Land of Israel became void, and Zionism and the State of Israel arose {{as a direct result of}} the breach by gentile nations of the Oaths.|$|E

I can't <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> for myself." [...] In the interview, host Plomley spoke of Bankhead's glory days as the most celebrated actress of 1920s London. Later he recalled of their interview, [...] "She was a very frail and ailing old lady, and I {{was shocked to see}} how old and ill she looked as I helped her out of a taxi. She had come from her hotel wearing a mink coat slung over a pair of lounging pyjamas, and she leaned heavily on my arm as I supported her to the lift. Her eyes were still fine, and there was still beauty in the bone structure of her face beneath the wrinkles and ravages of hard living. Her hands shook, and when she wished to go to the loo she had to ask Monica Chapman to accompany her to help her with her clothing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Vera Elizabeth Claythorne, a cool, efficient, {{resourceful}} {{young woman}} who is on leave from her position as a sports mistress at a third-rate girls' school. She has largely worked at secretarial jobs ever since {{her job as a}} governess was ended by the death of her charge, Cyril Hamilton, whom she intentionally allowed to swim out to sea – as the child had wanted to do, but had theretofore been denied as too dangerous – and drowned. She did this so her lover, Cyril's uncle, Hugo Hamilton, could become the family heir, inherit the estate and marry her, which had been their original plan before Cyril's birth changed things. She swam out to sea to [...] "save" [...] Cyril to make it seem he had disobeyed her – as she had consistently told him it was too dangerous – but knowing she would not arrive in time. Her plan backfired when Hugo, who loved his nephew, abandoned her after he somehow sensed what she had done. Hugo, ironically, did become the heir but has become a miserable drunkard. On a fateful transatlantic journey, he met Wargrave and, inebriated, told the judge, [...] "I've known a murderess – known her, I tell you [...] ... Women are fiends – absolute fiends – you wouldn't think a girl like that – a nice straight jolly girl – you wouldn't think she'd do that, would you? That she'd take a kid out to sea and let it drown – you wouldn't think a woman could <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> like that?"Wargrave was able to trace Vera with this information, and lure her to the island. In the penultimate scene of the novel, she manages to take Lombard's gun, and shoot him dead in what she believed was self-defence. She returns to the house, relieved she has survived. When she goes to her room, she finds a readied noose, complete with chair beneath it, suspended from a hook hanging from the ceiling. She, in what Wargrave, [...] hidden from her sight, describes first hand as a post-traumatic state, sees and hears Hugo, her former lover, encouraging her. She adjusts the noose round her neck and kicks the chair away, fulfilling the rhyme's final verse ("One little Soldier Boy left all alone; He went out and hanged himself and then there were none.") ...|$|E
