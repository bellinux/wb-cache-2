A 2014 review found that the heart disease and diabetes risks associated with different diets appear to be similar.

Success rates of long-term weight loss maintenance with lifestyle changes are low, ranging from 2–20%. Dietary and lifestyle changes are effective in limiting excessive weight gain in pregnancy and improve outcomes for both the mother and the child. Intensive behavioral counseling is recommended in those who are both obese and have other risk factors for heart disease.|$|E

However, it was quickly discontinued when excessive dosing led to adverse side effects including hyperthermia and death. β3 agonists, like CL316,243, have also been developed and tested in humans.

Individuals with anorexia nervosa and some athletes try to control body weight with laxatives, diet pills or diuretic drugs, although these generally have no impact on body fat. Products that work as a laxative can cause the blood's potassium level to drop, which may cause heart and/or muscle problems. Pyruvate is a popular product that may result in a small amount of weight loss. However, pyruvate, which is found in red apples, cheese, and red wine, has not been thoroughly studied and its weight loss potential has not been scientifically established.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, non-selective {{serotonin}} receptor antagonists demonstrated {{a relationship between}} serotonin receptors and food intake. Later, animal studies showed that serotonin receptor agonists might act as a mediator of satiety. Serotonin has been implicated as {{a critical factor in}} the short-term regulation of food intake and in promoting loss of weight associated with hyperphagia. Studies using pharmacological and genetic tools demonstrated that the 5-HT2C receptor subtype was one of the principal mediators through which serotonin exerts its anorectic effects in rodents. Subsequently, these receptors became a promising pharmacotherapeutic target for further investigation for the treatment of obesity. The development of 5-HT2C receptor knockout mice in the mid-1990s was a hallmark achievement in the identification and development of serotonergic drugs <b>for</b> <b>weight</b> <b>loss.</b> These knockout mice were hyperphagic, which led to obesity, partial Leptin resistance, increased adipose deposition, insulin resistance, and impaired glucose tolerance. As a result of these symptoms, the researchers identified a functional role for the receptors in serotonergic regulation of food intake and body weight. Later, 5-HT2C receptors were proposed as a therapeutic target for the treatment of multiple central nervous system (CNS) disorders including: psychiatric disorders, obesity, sexual dysfunction and urinary incontinence.|$|E
25|$|At the 1994 World Cup in the United States, Maradona {{played in}} only two games (both at the Foxboro Stadium near Boston), scoring one goal against Greece, before being sent home after failing a drug test for {{ephedrine}} doping. In his autobiography, Maradona argued that the test result was due to his personal trainer giving him the power drink Rip Fuel. His claim was that the U.S. version, unlike the Argentine one, contained the chemical and that, having run out of his Argentine dosage, his trainer unwittingly bought the U.S. formula. FIFA expelled him from USA '94, and Argentina were subsequently eliminated {{in the second round}} by Romania in Los Angeles. Maradona has also separately claimed that he had an agreement with FIFA, on which the organization reneged, to allow him to use the drug <b>for</b> <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> before the competition {{in order to be able}} to play. His failed drugs test at the 1994 World Cup signaled the end of his international career, which had lasted 17 years and yielded 34 goals from 91 games, as well as one winner's medal and one runners-up medal in the World Cup.|$|E

First, based on findings from a previous research (Dalle Grave et al. 2005), we hypothesized that specific patient variables {{would be associated with}} attrition from SCM. Those variables included percent of initial weight lost during LMR, satisfaction with <b>weight</b> pre-SCM, expectation <b>for</b> further <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> pre-SCM, and duration of time expected to achieve desired <b>weight</b> <b>loss.</b> Second, we were interested in investigating if patients’ expectations <b>for</b> further <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> would decrease after 52 -weeks of maintenance treatment. We hypothesized that expectations <b>for</b> further <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> would decrease to reflect actual body weight after patients attempted to sustain weight lost during LMR for 52  weeks.|$|R
