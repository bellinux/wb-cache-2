30|$|The multivariate {{analysis}} required {{us to use}} a slightly different data classification. To have sufficient power to test whether fire {{had a significant effect}} on community structure within each vegetation type, it was necessary for us to reclassify and condense the <b>fire</b> <b>classification</b> into only two categories: razed and non-razed. In terms of the BARI classifications described above, all pre-fire surveys (before reference and before impact) plus the post-fire surveys at unburned points (after reference) form the non-razed condition. We called the data collected at the post-fire burned survey points (after impact) the razed samples.|$|E
30|$|We {{used the}} ANOSIM results as an omnibus test for {{limiting}} Type 1 error and determining if further analyses were warranted. If the condensed <b>fire</b> <b>classification</b> (razed and non-razed) {{was not a}} significant predictor of bird community structure within each vegetation type, we conducted no further tests. If the <b>fire</b> <b>classification</b> was significant, we conducted two additional tests; the first was to look for patterns between the amount of shrub and tree cover and the bird community, and the second was to investigate the responses of individual species. We used the biotic-environmental matching (BioEnv) procedure within PRIMER-E to determine if the total shrub and tree cover was significantly associated with the differences between the bird communities in the razed and non-razed samples (Clarke 1993, Clarke and Ainsworth 1993). The BioEnv procedure generates similarity matrices of the bird community samples by ranking them from high to low similarity. Similarly, it ranks the percent of shrub and tree cover from high to low values. These are then compared using a weighted Spearman statistic (ρ). The test statistic, ρ, can range between − 1 and 1; where 1 indicates complete correlation between the bird community structure and the percentage of shrub and tree cover, ρ = 0 indicates no correlation, and − 1 represents complete opposition. BioEnv calculates significance by permutation (Clarke and Ainsworth 1993).|$|E

40|$|With the {{implementation}} of the classes of reaction to fire performance for construction products, the so-called "Euroclasses", a new test method has been introduced, namely the SBI test method (EN 13823). This method is an intermediate scale test and it has been developed to allow harmonization of the reaction to <b>fire</b> <b>classification</b> in Europe. As the test is new and needs rather large samples there will be a need from the industry to have an easy and cost effective tool for product development and quality control with respect to this method. In the near future also the possibility of using an appeal procedure by running the reference scenario test, ISO 9705, will be possible. Also for this test it wouldbe an advantage to have a screening method. In this project such a tool has been developed by using cone calorimeter data according to ISO 5660. The tool allows prediction of the major classification parameters for HRR and SPR in the SBI and room corner. Within the project a software tool has also been developed. The results of the project show that the predictions are satisfactory and that the tool will be powerful for the product development by industry.

40|$|Retrospective {{identification}} of fire severity can improve {{our understanding of}} fire behaviour and ecological responses. However, burnt area records for many ecosystems are non-existent or incomplete, {{and those that are}} documented rarely include fire severity data. Retrospective analysis using satellite remote sensing data captured over extended periods can provide better estimates of fire history. This study aimed to assess the relationship between the Landsat differenced normalised burn ratio (dNBR) and field measured geometrically structured composite burn index (GeoCBI) for retrospective analysis of fire severity over a 23 year period in sclerophyll woodland and heath ecosystems. Further, we assessed for reduced dNBR <b>fire</b> severity <b>classification</b> accuracies associated with vegetation regrowth at increasing time between ignition and image capture. This was achieved by assessing four Landsat images captured at increasing time since ignition of the most recent burnt area.

Non-significant and weak linear relationships were observed for heath and Melaleuca quinquenervia ecosystems, suggesting that GeoCBI–dNBR was not appropriate for <b>fire</b> severity <b>classification</b> in specific ecosystems.

Designing a model with material parameters can be made in several different ways. It can either be done by practical inquiry, e. g. scanning different reactions, measure other parameters etcetera or you can make it by estimations of the properties based on the material compounds and construct a model by trial and error. FS-GPG resembles plasterboard/gypsum in many ways. Therefore the model is constructed with properties close to plasterboards properties found in literature. FS-GPG as well as plasterboard or gypsum contains considerable amounts of water. When the material is heated, free water will at first merge from the material. When further heated, dehydration will take place. Two reactions will occur at different temperatures due to dehydration where the gypsum forms new products. At these two reactions, energy is consumed by the water released from the crystals, delaying the temperature enhancement.

40|$|Abstract: We {{present an}} {{overview}} of the Fuel Characteristic Classification System (FCCS), a tool that enables land man-agers, regulators, and scientists to create and catalogue fuelbeds and to classify those fuelbeds for their capacity to support fire and consume fuels. The fuelbed characteristics and <b>fire</b> <b>classification</b> from this tool will provide inputs for current and future sophisticated models for the quantification of fire behavior, fire effects, and carbon accounting and enable assess-ment of fuel treatment effectiveness. The system was designed from requirements provided by land managers, scientists, and policy makers gathered through six regional workshops. The FCCS contains a set of fuelbeds representing the United States, which were compiled from scientific literature, fuels photo series, fuels data sets, and expert opinion. The system enables modification and enhancement of these fuelbeds to represent a particular scale of interest. The FCCS then reports assigned and calculated fuel characteristics for each existing fuelbed stratum including the canopy, shrubs, nonwoody, woody, litter-lichen-moss, and duff. Finally, the system classifies each fuelbed by calculating fire potentials that provide an index of the intrinsic capacity of each fuelbed to support surface fire behavior, support crown fire, and provide fuels for flaming, smoldering, and residual consumption. The FCCS outputs are being used in a national wildland fire emissions inventory and in the development of fuelbed, fire hazard, and treatment effectiveness maps on several national forests. Although the FCCS was built for the United States, the conceptual framework is applicable worldwide.

40|$|Fire event {{management}} always needs human intervention {{in order to}} extinguish forest fires. Firemen equipment reached high performance and safety standards but high temperatures occurring in proximity of a forest fire may cause bodily temperature increase and dehydration. Therefore {{it is important to}} identify a distance limit at which an operator can work without problems and complications due to the heat during forest fire fighting actions. This work describes an new approach to find a safety limit for firemen. The distance limit at which the operators can work without any consequence is evaluated considering the bodily temperature increase of a man exposed {{for a period of time}} at the thermal radiations coming from the fire. The main characteristic of the model is the use of radiometry to evaluate the amount of thermal energy transferred. By varying the distance between the fire and the operator it is possible to evaluate the bodily temperature increase. Safety distance limit is identified when human body temperature starts to be dangerous (38. 5 °C). In order to evaluate the distance safety value a fire model and an operator model are given. The fire model is based on the international Brown and Davis forest <b>fire</b> <b>classification</b> in order to consider some various realistic forest fire types. The fire fighter representation is established according to physiological and medical data in order to have a good representation of a real fireman. The results of the model have been compared with the ones coming from other models used for the same purpose based on probabilistic methods and the comparison confirms the good validity of the presented model. This fact, together with the simplicity of the model structure and the practicality of the safety distance as a reference limits allows the model to be used in future applications in order to identify and prevent some possible dangerous situations for operator engaged in forest fire fightin...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{was to find a}} new gasket {{material}} to be used in frequency converters manufactured by ABB. The new material has to comply to RoHS directive, because this material is going to replace the currently used material, which is not RoHS compliant. The material is going to be used in conditions, where it may be subjected to chemicals and especially oils, so it should have a good resistance to both. In addition to finding the material, this thesis considers factors affecting elastomer’s swelling in oil. Some requirements were set for the gasket material. The hardness of the material should not be over 60 Shore A and its tear strength should not be less than 23 kN/m. The material should also have a <b>fire</b> <b>classification</b> minimum of V 1. The most important criterion was the oil resistance. Gasket material should not swell more than 25 percent from its initial volume when immersed in oil. The literature part of this thesis consists of introducing four material groups which have such properties which are required from the gasket material and considers those properties. These four groups are thermoplastic polyurethanes, styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene, thermoplastic vulcanizate elastomers and co-polyester based elasto-mers. The literature part also discusses the factors which help estimate the amount of swelling based on the structure of the thermoplastic elastomer. The experiment part of this thesis introduces immersion tests which have been used to determine oil resistance of the test materials. Six materials were tested, the names of the materials are confidential, they are coded to be Materials A, B, C, D, E and F. From these results, the best suited material for the new gasket material was elected. Also from the results, it was possible to determine dependence of swelling on volume, area, vo-lume/area ratio and density of the sample. One suitable material was found in addition to a few others that require more test-ing. The only geometrical factor found to contribute materials swelling was volume/area ratio. Once the graph is made for a certain material, it helps to predict the swelling of a sample with a certain volume/area ratio made from the same material. The tests made for this thesis will continue after this thesis is completed. Some new sample geometries and new materials will be tested. /Kir 1...|$|E

It is not clear how much forested area burns in smaller fires or whether ground-based fire severity estimates from a statistical sample of all forest lands might provide additional, useful information. We developed a tree mortality based <b>fire</b> severity <b>classification</b> using remeasured tree data from 10, 008 plots in a probabilistic survey of National Forests System (NFS) lands in Oregon and Washington, using 8 tree mortality and abundance metrics. We estimate that 12. 5 % (± 0. 7 % SE) of NFS forest lands in the region experienced a fire event during 1993 – 2007, with an annual rate of 0. 96 % (± 0. 05 %). An estimated 6. 5 % of forest lands burned at High Severity or Moderate Severity; 2. 1 % burned at Very Low severity or only experienced surface or understory fire. A total of 358 of the 507 burned plots were within the MTBS perimeters, with ∼ 45 % having equivalent severity classifications; but for ∼ 51 % of the plots the MTBS classifications suggested lower severity than the tree-mortality based classes.

Fire retardant treatments can improve the reaction to fire properties of wood and thehighest <b>fire</b> <b>classifications</b> for combustible products can be reached, for example class Bs 1,d 0. This means that visible wood surfaces {{can be used in}} higher and larger buildings. Fire retardant treatment has no or very limited effect on the fire resistance of structuralelements, as the charring rate is hardly changed. One exception is intumescent fireretardant paints that swell and may postpone charring and thus increase the fireresistance. However, the improved fire behavior of many fire retardant treated woodproducts deteriorates over time, especially at outdoor use due to leaching. A system ofdurability classes has been developed as a complement to fire classes and makes itpossible for potential users to find reliable products for different uses. Fire retardanttreated wood products can maintain their properties after accelerated and/or natural agingif the retention levels are high enough, but many products are losing their firecharacteristics during aging. Paint systems are usually needed at exterior applications tomaintain the fire performance properties.
