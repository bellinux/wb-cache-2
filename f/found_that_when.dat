5|$|In February 2007 it was <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> {{customers}} {{added value}} to their cards at self-service add-value points located in MTR and Light rail stations, their bank accounts were debited {{even if the}} transactions had been cancelled. Octopus Cards Limited claimed that the fault was due to an upgrade of communication systems. Initially, two cases were reported. The company then announced {{that the use of}} the payment system, Electronic Payment Services (EPS), at add-value service points would be suspended until further notice, and that it had started an investigation into the reasons for the problem.|$|E
5|$|Research {{conducted}} {{on the effects of}} partial epileptic seizures on consciousness found that patients who suffer from partial epileptic seizures experience altered states of consciousness. In partial epileptic seizures, consciousness is impaired or lost while some aspects of consciousness, often automated behaviors, remain intact. Studies <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> measuring the qualitative features during partial epileptic seizures, patients exhibited an increase in arousal and became absorbed in the experience of the seizure, followed by difficulty in focusing and shifting attention.|$|E

5|$|The nuclear {{properties}} of plutonium-239 were also studied; researchers <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> it is {{hit by a}} neutron it breaks apart (fissions) by releasing more neutrons and energy. These neutrons can hit other atoms of plutonium-239 and so on in an exponentially fast chain reaction. This can result in an explosion large enough to destroy a city if enough of the isotope is concentrated to form a critical mass.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{metformin}} {{during all}} parts of pregnancy is controversial. One review <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> taken during pregnancy it reduces the number of complications during pregnancy and {{does not appear to}} cause developmental delays. Another review found good short term safety for both the mother and baby but unclear long term safety.|$|E
5|$|Unconscious {{self-regulation}} {{has been}} found to increase under psychological threat. For the effect to be one of unconscious self-regulation it too should increase under threat. Jones, Pelham, Mirenberg, and Hetts <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> people who were high in explicit self-esteem were exposed to a psychological threat, they showed exaggerated name-letter preferences. In contrast, low self-esteem participants showed evidence of the opposite tendency. Komori and Murata later replicated this response to threat with Japanese bilinguals who were asked to select preferred letters of the English alphabet.|$|E

5|$|Asch {{found that}} some 1/4 of all {{subjects}} successfully withstands this form of social pressure, 1//20 completely succumbs, while the remainder conforms to the majority's manifestly incorrect opinion only in some experimental rounds. Asch suggested that this procedure created a doubt in the participants' mind about the seemingly obvious answer. Participants reported that the correct but rejected line was almost but not quite equal to the standard line. Asch {{also found that the}} effectiveness of the group pressure increased significantly from 1 person to 3 people unanimously responding incorrectly. However, there was not much increase after that. He also <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> one confederate responded correctly, the power of the majority to influence the subject decreased substantially.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to playing the game, Adams {{was involved in}} the production of early baseball equipment. He personally manufactured baseballs for a period of time, supplying many New York City-based clubs. Adams <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the ball was more tightly stitched, it traveled further when batted or thrown. According to author Peter Morris, Adams' ball-manufacturing efforts helped to keep the Knickerbockers in operation during their first few years, as they would otherwise have had difficulty finding balls. In later years Adams gathered rubber from old galoshes for the insides of baseballs. A tanner then used horsehide to create the balls. As late as 1863, Adams was one of the three most prominent makers of baseballs in New York, continuing to produce them by hand. Adams also played a role in producing baseball bats, choosing which wood to use and overseeing the manufacturing process.|$|E

Research conducted on some common spalting fungi <b>found</b> <b>that</b> Trametes versicolor, <b>when</b> paired with Bjerkandera adusta, took 8 weeks to spalt 1.5" [...] cubes of Acer saccharum. [...] Colonization continued to progress after this time period, but the structural integrity of the wood was compromised.

5|$|The first {{clinical}} study of psilocybin {{approved by the}} U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 1970—led by Francisco Moreno at the University of Arizona {{and supported by the}} Heffter Research Institute and the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies—studied the effects of psilocybin on patients with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). The pilot study <b>found</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> administered by trained professionals in a medical setting, the use of psilocybin was associated with substantial reductions in OCD symptoms in several of the patients. This effect is caused largely by psilocybin's ability to reduce the levels of the 5-HT2A receptor, resulting in decreased responsiveness to serotonin.|$|E
5|$|In 2014 Consumer Reports {{published}} {{results from}} a survey conducted with 19 secret shoppers that went to 85 dealerships in four states, making anonymous visits between December 2013 and March 2014. The secret shoppers asked a number of specific questions about cars to test the salespeople’s knowledge about electric cars. The consumer magazine decided to conduct the survey after several consumers who {{wanted to buy a}} plug-in car reported to the organization that some dealerships were steering them toward gasoline-powered models. The survey found that not all sales people seemed enthusiastic about making PEV sales; a few outright discouraged it, and even one dealer was reluctant to even show a plug-in model despite having one in stock. And many sales people seemed not to have a good understanding of electric-car tax breaks and other incentives or of charging needs and costs. Consumer Reports also <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> it came to answering basic questions, sales people at Chevrolet, Ford, and Nissan dealerships tended to be better informed than those at Honda and Toyota. The survey found that most of the Toyota dealerships visited recommended against buying a Prius Plug-in and suggested buying a standard Prius hybrid instead. Overall, the secret shoppers reported that only 13 dealers “discouraged sale of EV,” with seven of them being in New York. However, at 35 of the 85 dealerships visited, the secret shoppers said sales people recommended buying a gasoline-powered car instead.|$|E
5|$|Similar to the United Kingdom's position, {{judicial}} review in Singapore {{is confined to}} matters of public law, and the applicable tests are the source test and nature test. The Datafin decision was applied by the Singapore Court of Appeal in Public Service Commission v. Lai Swee Lin Linda (2001), where the respondent, an employee with the Land Office, had the probationary period of her employment extended without prior warning. Her employment contract was later terminated. She complained to various statutory bodies, and ultimately to the Public Service Commission ("PSC"), but was unsuccessful in having her employment reinstated. She then sought leave from the High Court to apply for {{judicial review}} against the PSC. In the course of its judgment, the Court of Appeal accepted that the source test {{is one of the}} tests that can be relied on to determine whether a decision by a body is amenable to judicial review. In addition, it noted that Datafin had held that the source test is not the only applicable test. However, the Court did not embark on a discussion of the nature test because it <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the respondent's employer had made the decisions concerning her employment, it had acted pursuant to her contractual terms of service and had not exercised its statutory powers. Thus, the decisions were not susceptible to judicial review. It did not invariably follow that when a statutory body makes a decision it is exercising a statutory power.|$|E
50|$|Because of the {{conflicting}} theories under the evaluation approach, {{there has been}} controversy over its reliability.
