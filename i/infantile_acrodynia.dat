The word is derived from the Greek, where άκρο means end or extremity, and οδυνη means pain. [...] Acrodynia resulted primarily from calomel in teething powders and decreased greatly after calomel was excluded from most teething powders in 1954.|$|E

50|$|Kawasaki {{disease can}} only be {{diagnosed}} clinically (i.e., by medical signs and symptoms). No specific laboratory test exists for this condition. It is difficult to establish the diagnosis, especially early {{in the course of}} the illness, and frequently children are not diagnosed until they have seen several health-care providers. Many other serious illnesses can cause similar symptoms, and must be considered in the differential diagnosis, including scarlet fever, toxic shock syndrome, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and childhood mercury poisoning (<b>infantile</b> <b>acrodynia).</b>|$|E
5000|$|After finding {{associations}} between mercurial diuretics and [...] "mercurial" [...] nephrotic syndrome, {{in addition to}} the sharp decline in <b>infantile</b> <b>acrodynia</b> cases after the late 1950s following the removal of many sources of childhood mercury exposure, the dangers of mercurial diuretics were realized. This led to the discontinuation of mercurial diuretics in favor of far less toxic and far more effective diuretics. This is similar to the fashion in which penicillin quickly replaced arsenic and mercury as the main antibiotic used in the treatment of syphilis for both children and adults.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the {{idiosyncratic}} {{nature of}} mercury toxicity, {{the risk of}} severe disease and sudden death are unpredictable and frequently show no warning signs. Physicians during the 20th century believed that a fever/rash complex suggested the risk of severe side effects for the next upcoming doses if treatment was not halted. Warkany and Hubbard (1953) noted in their seminal paper establishing mercury {{as the cause of}} <b>infantile</b> <b>acrodynia</b> that [...] "... in modern times the capricious behavior of mercurial diuretics has been rather disturbing to those who use them frequently. Thousands of injections are given without untoward effects but occasionally a therapeutic dose results in sudden death. Only rarely is this caused by the first dose. More often the patient tolerates several - in one case 164 - doses before the fatal reaction occurs. The mechanism of these reactions is not clear: they can neither be explained nor predicted; yet they cannot be denied." ...|$|E
40|$|Very {{little is}} known about {{mechanisms}} of idiosyncratic sensitivity to the damaging effects of mercury (Hg); however, there is likely a genetic component. The aim {{of the present study was}} to search for genetic variation in genes thought to be involved in Hg metabolism and transport in a group of individuals identified as having elevated Hg sensitivity compared to a normal control group. Materials and Methods: Survivors of pink disease (PD; <b>infantile</b> <b>acrodynia)</b> are a population of clinically identifiable individuals who are Hg sensitive. In the present study, single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes thought to be involved in Hg transport and metabolism were compared across two groups: (i) PD survivors (n = 25); and (ii) age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n = 25). Results: Analyses revealed significant differences between groups in genotype frequencies for rs 662 in the gene encoding paraoxanase 1 (PON 1) and rs 1801131 in the gene encoding methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). Conclusions: We have identified two genetic polymorphisms associated with increased sensitivity to Hg. Genetic variation in MTHFR and PON 1 significantly differentiated a group formerly diagnosed with PD (a condition of Hg hypersensitivity) with age- and gender-matched healthy controls...|$|E
40|$|Pink disease (<b>infantile</b> <b>acrodynia)</b> was {{especially}} {{prevalent in the}} first half of the 20 th century. Primarily attributed to exposure to mercury (Hg) commonly found in teething powders, the condition was developed by approximately 1 in 500 exposed children. The differential risk factor was identified as an idiosyncratic sensitivity to Hg. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have also been postulated to be produced by Hg. Analogous to the pink disease experience, Hg exposure is widespread yet only a fraction of exposed children develop an ASD, suggesting sensitivity to Hg may also be present in children with an ASD. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that individuals with a known hypersensitivity to Hg (pink disease survivors) may be more likely to have descendants with an ASD. Five hundred and twenty-two participants who had previously been diagnosed with pink disease completed a survey on the health outcomes of their descendants. The prevalence rates of ASD and a variety of other clinical conditions diagnosed in childhood (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, epilepsy, Fragile X syndrome, and Down syndrome) were compared to well-established general population prevalence rates. The results showed the prevalence rate of ASD among the grandchildren of pink disease survivors (1 in 25) to be significantly higher than the comparabl...|$|E
