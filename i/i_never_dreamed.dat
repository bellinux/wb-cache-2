25|$|Upon {{watching}} {{the tape of}} the beating, LAPD chief of police Daryl Gates said: I stared at the screen in disbelief. I played the one-minute-50-second tape again. Then again and again, until I had viewed it 25 times. And still I could not believe what I was looking at. To see my officers engage {{in what appeared to}} be excessive use of force, possibly criminally excessive, to see them beat a man with their batons 56 times, to see a sergeant on the scene who did nothing to seize control, was something <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>dreamed</b> I would witness.|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{view the}} scene in which Cagney pushes a {{grapefruit}} into Mae Clarke's face {{as one of the}} most famous moments in movie history. The scene itself was a late addition, and who thought of the idea is a matter of debate. Producer Darryl Zanuck claimed he thought of it in a script conference, director William Wellman claimed that the idea came to him when he saw the grapefruit on the table during the shoot, and writers Glasmon and Bright claimed it was based on the real life of gangster Hymie Weiss, who threw an omelette into his girlfriend's face. Cagney himself usually cited the writers' version, but the fruit's victim, Clarke, agreed that it was Wellman's idea, saying, [...] "I'm sorry I ever agreed to do the grapefruit bit. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>dreamed</b> it would be shown in the movie. Director Bill Wellman thought of the idea suddenly. It wasn't even written into the script.".|$|E
2500|$|That {{is three}} to four times wider than {{recommended}} by Army textbooks. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>dreamed</b> that we would have a defensive position of this size without any backup or help from our division or regiment. When I got to Höfen, I found the area too big to cover in one afternoon. So I stayed in the village overnight." ...|$|E

Well, Sir Jarvy, of all {{characters}} {{and descriptions of}} me, that your honour has seen fit to put abroad, {{this is the most}} unjustest; chickens being a food <b>I</b> <b>never</b> thinks on, off soundings. Pig-headed you might in reason call me, Sir Jarvy; for I do looks arter the pigs, which is the only real stand-by in a ship; but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>dreams</b> of a chicken, except for your happetite.

2500|$|The {{session for}} the song took place at Olympic Sound Studios in {{south-west}} London in April 1969. Harrison asked Eric Clapton, Keith Richards and Ginger Baker to participate, about which Preston later said: [...] "George said he'd invite {{some of his friends}} over to help out on my Apple debut, and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>dreamed</b> he meant [...]" [...] Like Harrison, Richards had met Preston earlier in the 1960s, when the Rolling Stones appeared on the popular music show Shindig! in Los Angeles in May 1965.|$|E
2500|$|... "He (Marriott) was {{certainly}} the most talented person I ever worked with. He was like a brother to me and I was devastated when he died. He always lived on the edge and I was always waiting for a 'phone call {{to say that he}} had died but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>dreamed</b> it would be under those circumstances. He's never got the credit he deserves. He should be in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame because he was the greatest white soul singer that England ever produced. I'm certain that if you caught the likes of Rod Stewart and Paul Rodgers in a private moment and asked them who was the main man, they would say, Steve Marriott." [...] – Jerry Shirley ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{engagement}} {{took place}} in January 1874, pleasing both families. Grand Duke Konstantine wrote to the King and Queen profusely thanking them for the help they had given to his daughter. Queen Olga wrote to her friend Marie von Kinderlen-Waechter, [...] "My problem child is now a happy bride, loving and beloved. [...] <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>dreamed</b> that such happiness could exist. Eugen is already like a son to the King. [...] I fold my hands and thank God {{day and night for}} such a blessing". [...] Even the heir to the Württemberg throne, Prince William, wrote that Vera was the luckiest bride in the world. [...] "While she is very ugly and will always remain so, compared to how she was as a child she is unbelievably improved. [...] I consider her not to be without accomplishments, and, I believe, not without heart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] she exclaimed, [...] "don't {{speak to}} me! don't touch me!--let me enjoy it! There is no {{disappointment}} here. <b>I</b> have <b>never</b> thought, <b>I</b> have <b>never</b> <b>dreamed,</b> of anything half so beautiful as this!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I knew it not! Peradventure I {{have been}} unwise. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>dreamed</b> {{it had a}} name--ah, sweet heaven, I thought it was original." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I am frightened," [...] Saxon quavered huskily, with a half-sob of nervousness. [...] "You frighten me. I am very foolish, and I know so little, that <b>I</b> had <b>never</b> <b>dreamed...</b> THAT." ...|$|R
