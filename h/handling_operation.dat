2500|$|Caledonian re-applied to the ATLB for a licence {{to launch}} transatlantic {{scheduled}} services from Gatwick, Heathrow or Stansted via Prestwick to New York JFK, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Toronto, and from Birmingham via Prestwick to New York, in 1967. These services {{were to be}} gradually introduced between 1969/70 and 1970/71 utilising the new 707s. BUA, British Eagle and Transglobe Airways simultaneously applied for similar licences. Caledonian objected to the other independent airlines' applications. BOAC opposed all the independents' applications. The Board of Trade (BOT) directed the ATLB to prejudge the four contenders' applications in order to concentrate only on those that stood a reasonable chance of success under existing bilateral arrangements before the route licensing hearings could begin. As a result, BUA withdrew its own applications but objected to Caledonian's and British Eagle's. Transglobe withdrew its applications as well. Caledonian and British Eagle objected to each other's applications. The ATLB heard Caledonian's applications, British Eagle's counter applications [...] and BOAC's objections in early 1968. Following {{the conclusion of the}} transatlantic scheduled licensing hearings in mid-1968, the ATLB rejected Caledonian's and British Eagle's applications. It felt that the independents generally lacked the financial strength to acquire the then latest widebodied and supersonic transport (SST) aircraft for their proposed services, and that these airlines had insufficient economies of scale to enable them to compete with BOAC and the American carriers on a level playing field. It also felt that it would take the independents too long to make these services profitable. In Caledonian's case, the ATLB found that despite having a dedicated North American sales force and its own ground <b>handling</b> <b>operation</b> at John F. Kennedy Airport, the airline's lack of any kind of scheduled service experience and its almost total reliance on Sabena's and Aviation Traders' engineering support counted against granting it a scheduled service licence {{for one of the most}} competitive air markets in the world. Secondary factors for the ATLB's rejection of Caledonian's applications included the delay in the introduction of Concorde and the non-availability within the envisaged timeframe of widebodied aircraft that were smaller and carried a lower price tag than the Boeing 747, which would have made them better suited to the type of operation proposed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Speed {{and size}} are two {{important}} factors while designing the electronic system. It’s Speed of operation and flexibility to modify, measures {{the performance of}} the system operation. Microprocessor/microcontroller (MPMC) system can <b>handle</b> sequential <b>operations</b> with high flexibility and use of Complex Programmable Devices (CPLD) can <b>handle</b> concurrent <b>operations</b> with high speed in small size area. So combined features of both these systems can enhance {{the performance of the}} system. High performance Hybrid Telephone Switching System (HTSS) is designed using combination of stored program control (SPC) and VLSI technology. Call <b>handling</b> <b>operations</b> are <b>handled</b> by concurrent <b>operations</b> using CPLD and complicated sequential <b>operations</b> like service <b>handling</b> are handled by MPMC. VHDL codes are designed and tested for different call <b>handling</b> <b>operations.</b> The test benches are designed to act as MPMC for the testing of services like Do Not Disturb (DND), Call Forwarding (CF), Outgoing Bar (OGB) and STD Bar (STDB) facilities. Call handling speed of available system designed with MPMC and proposed system designed with CPLD is compared...|$|R

50|$|The Saskatchewan Wheat Pool was a grain handling, {{agri-food}} {{processing and}} marketing {{company based in}} Regina, Saskatchewan. The Pool created a network of marketing alliances in North America and internationally which made it the largest agricultural grain <b>handling</b> <b>operation</b> {{in the province of}} Saskatchewan. Before becoming Viterra, SWP had operated 276 retail outlets and more than 100 grain handling and marketing centres. The Saskatchewan Wheat Pool operated under the name of AgPro in the prairie provinces of Manitoba and Alberta. Begun as a co-operative in the 1920s, the company became a publicly traded corporation in the 1990s. After the 2007 takeover of its competitor, Winnipeg-based Agricore United, the Pool name was retired.

The operation is divided into stages and assumed to be stationary within each stage. The emphasis was placed on the vessel behaviour in waves, although the model and the procedure {{can also be used to}} study wind and current effects. In addition, the need for improving current practice of anchor <b>handling</b> <b>operation</b> planning in the view of the methodology outlined is discussed.

40|$|Micro-material {{handling}} has challenges accompanying {{it because}} of adhesive forces, which make the picking and placing of micro-parts difficult. The adhesive forces hinder the picking of a micro-part, and once picked, they pose even a greater challenge when attempts to release a micro-part are made. Van der Waals forces {{are part of the}} adhesive forces and are always present between interacting surfaces in a micro-material <b>handling</b> <b>operation.</b> However, Van der Waals forces can profitably be manipulated in a micro-material <b>handling</b> <b>operation.</b> The paper reveals how the Van der Waals forces can be advantageously used in micro-material handling operations involving silver, copper and aluminium coatings of rms surface roughness values ranging from 0. 5 nm to 2. 72 nm, which are produced by the electron beam evaporation (e-beam) method. These were found to exert Van der Waals forces ranging from 17 nN to 314 nN, which can be used for reliable micro-material handling operations...|$|E
