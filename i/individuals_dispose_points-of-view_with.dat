This {{study was designed to}} test the hypothesis that among college students in an unselected sample, social anxiety and experience of perceptual anomalies would not only each independently predict the experience of self-reported paranoid ideation, but would also interact to predict paranoid patterns of thought. A diverse sample of 644 students completed a large battery of self-report measures, as well as the five-factor Paranoia/Suspiciousness Questionnaire (PSQ). We conducted hierarchical multiple regression analyses predicting scores on each PSQ factor from responses on measures of social anxiety, perceptual aberration, and the interaction between the two constructs. Current general negative affect was covaried in all analyses. We found that both social anxiety and perceptual aberrations, along with negative affect, predicted multiple dimensions of paranoia as measured by the PSQ; the two constructs did not, however, interact significantly to predict any dimensions. Our findings suggest that perceptual aberration and anxiety may contribute to normal-range paranoid ideation in an additive rather than an interactive manner...|$|R

The budget was also cut, and the screen time allocated for the Japanese segment would now be no longer than 90 minutes—a major problem, considering that Kurosawa's script ran over four hours. After numerous revisions, a more or less finalized cut screenplay was agreed upon in May 1968. Shooting began in early December, but Kurosawa would last only a little over three weeks as director. He struggled to work with an unfamiliar crew and the requirements of a Hollywood production, while his working methods puzzled his American producers, who ultimately concluded that the director must be mentally ill.

Many of the discussions were authored by <b>individuals</b> favorably <b>disposed</b> to psychical research, such as William James and James H.

40|$|Researchers {{often use}} the term “sensitivity ” when theorizing that certain persons may be more readily {{affected}} by various influences than others. Through {{a review of the}} literature, it is argued that some <b>individuals</b> are <b>disposed</b> toward a range of sensitivities that, in novelty as well as intensity, distinguish them from the general population. The author cites evidence indicating that such persons exhibit greater susceptibility to a range of environmental factors including allergies, migraine headache, chronic pain, and chronic fatigue. Their immediate family members appear to be similarly affected. Additionally, these “sensitive” individuals report a high degree of anomalous perception. While no single factor in a person’s background is likely to distinguish him/her as sensitive, eight demographic or personality factors are found to be significant...|$|R

40|$|The {{search for}} a {{historically}} conscious <b>individual</b> who is <b>disposed</b> to “radical action” is {{the main thrust of}} this paper. This is premised on the following claims: first, that the modern society is a pathological society whose rules, most often but not necessarily, imply control and domination; thus a “refusal” to abide by these rules is the most appropriate alternative available; and, second, that there is still hope for the Enlightenment’s project of emancipation, that is, such “refusal,” which means a political fight for liberation, is still winnable no matter how formidable the forces of domination may be. But this paper can only do so much. I do not offer any universal and prefab solution to the pathological society. What I do instead is argue that the emergence of a historically conscious <b>individual</b> who is <b>disposed</b> to “radical action,” which eventually leads to a “collective radical action,” is still possible today. I also argue that “radical action” presupposes an awareness of the concrete socio-historical situations, thus the importance of “historicity. ” This is done through a reconstructive reading of Marcuse’sCritical Theory. In fact, my argument is just an echo on what Marcuse did more than four decades ago...|$|R

We find that when <b>individuals</b> are <b>disposed</b> to form visual images, they have difficulty comprehending both verbal statements and pictures when the perspective from which the event is described differs from the perspective from which they have encountered similar events in daily life. Furthermore, the disposition to form visual images increases the intensity of emotional reactions to an event when the event is described from the perspective of someone in the situation in which it occurs. These effects are not evident, however, among individuals who typically process information semantically without forming visual images. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

This qualitative study uses empirical data collected from 30 one-on-one interviews conducted 12 to 16 months after the riots. To provide a theoretical framework for these risk perceptions Anthony Giddens' notion of ontological security, the inner balance between trust and anxiety is used. The data analysis shows that while individuals risk perceptions are complex and contradictory, they use a range of methods to create a balance between trust and anxiety.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{very early}} {{engagement}} in bulimic behaviors, such as binge eating, {{may be influenced}} by factors that <b>dispose</b> <b>individuals</b> to impulsive action as well as by factors that <b>dispose</b> <b>individuals</b> to depressive symptomatology. Using a longitudinal design, we conducted the first test of the simultaneous operation of both risk factors as children transition from elementary to middle school. METHOD: In a sample of 1, 906 children, we assessed risk for impulsive action (negative urgency, which is the tendency to act rashly when distressed, and eating expectancies, which are learned anticipations that eating will alleviate negative mood) and risk for depression (negative affect and depressive symptomatology) and binge eating behavior at three time points using a longitudinal design: the end of fifth grade (last year of elementary school: T 0), the beginning of sixth grade (first year of middle school: T 1), and the end of sixth grade (T 2). RESULTS: Both the impulsive action and depression pathways predicted very early engagement in binge eating: each accounted for variance beyond the other. Mediation tests found that T 1 eating expectancies mediated the predictive influence of T 0 negative urgency on T 2 binge eating (z[*]=[*] 2. 45, p[*]<[*]. 01) and that T 1 depressive symptoms mediated the influence of T 0 negative affect on T 2 binge eating (z[*]=[*] 2. 04, p[*]<[*]. 05). DISCUSSION: In children, elevated levels of both negative urgency and negative affect predict early binge eating. This finding has important clinical implications because there are different interventions for the two different risk processes...|$|R
40|$|Among {{adolescents}} and adults, {{there appear to}} be at least four different personality traits that <b>dispose</b> <b>individuals</b> to rash or ill-advised action: sensation seeking, negative urgency, lack of planning, and lack of perseverance. The four are only moderately correlated and they appear to play different roles in dysfunction. It is important to determine whether the traits are present among preadolescents because of their possible influence on subsequent development. The authors developed assessments of the four traits for preadolescent children and found evidence supporting (a) the internal consistency of each trait measure, (b) the convergent and discriminant validity of the four measures using the multitrait, multimethod technique, and (c) the hypothesis that the different traits correlated with different dysfunctional behaviors as predicted by theory. Pending further validation efforts, it appears to be the case that researchers may be able to distinguish among different dispositions to rash action prior to adolescence. Keywords impulsivity, children, negative urgency, traits, risky behavior This article describes evidence that different personality dispositions to rash action can be measured reliably and validly in preadolescent children. This work was based on an integration of two recent advances in the study of per-sonality. First, four different personality traits that <b>dispose</b> <b>individuals</b> to rash or impulsive action have been identified in {{adolescents and}} adults, and the different traits relate to different aspects of maladaptive behavior (Smith et al., 2007; Whiteside & Lynam, 2001).
