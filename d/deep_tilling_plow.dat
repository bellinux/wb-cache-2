40|$|Development {{dramatically}} {{alters the}} hydrologic cycle {{by changing the}} relative percentage of precipitation that contributes to groundwater recharge, evapotranspiration, and runoff. As land is developed, infiltration tends to decrease and stormwater runoff increases in both rate and volume due to increases in impervious area, soil crusting, and soil compaction. One problem with trying to infiltrate runoff on the remaining permeable land after development is that the soil is often heavily compacted by construction activities, preventing acceptable rates of infiltration. Three practices were evaluated in a field study for their effectiveness in reducing excess runoff volume caused by soil compaction. Twelve plots were installed in the early summer of 2002 on a silty soil that had been compacted to simulate construction activities. The plot treatments each had three replications and included a control with no other practices performed, <b>deep</b> <b>tilling</b> only; chisel <b>plowing</b> and deep tilling; and compost-amendment, chisel plowing; and <b>deep</b> <b>tilling.</b> Runoff volume {{and the amount of}} natural precipitation were recorded throughout the growing season. Regardless {{of the size of the}} storm event, the chisel-plowed and deep-tilled treatment and the compost-amended, chisel-plowed, and deep-tilled treatment showed large reductions in runoff volume compared to the control. The chisel-plowed and deep-tilled treatment reduced the volume of runoff by 36 to 53 percent. When compost was added, the reduction in runoff volume increased substantially to 74 to 91 percent. The deep-tilled only treatment was shown to increase runoff in all situations other than the rainfall simulation. The increases in runoff volume ranged from 11 to 64 percent. The chisel-plowed and compost-amended plots also produced more vegetative biomass and visually remained healthier than the other plots during the hot dry summer. i...|$|R

40|$|A field {{experimental}} {{study has been}} performed in a drained cropped peatland located in the Zennare Basin (south of the Venice Lagoon, Italy), to measure land subsidence due to peat oxidation and to address the primary relationships between the hydrological regime, the soil mass loss (in form of CO 2 efflux to the atmosphere), and the settlement rate. The latter, {{of the order of}} 0. 01 – 0. 02 m/a, has been proved to be related to soil CO 2 efflux due to organic matter oxidation. A series of CO 2 emission measurement campaigns has been performed between the years 2003 and 2005. The non-steady-state chamber method was employed to assess the efflux spatial variability and detect its relationship with the main hydrological parameters controlling the oxidation reaction, i. e., soil temperature, soil moisture, and organic matter content. The measurements, carried out in two sites located 1. 5 km apart, point out a great variability of the CO 2 emissions both in space and time. While the time-dependent behavior {{can be explained by the}} seasonal fluctuation of soil temperature, spatial variability shows a weak correlation with the variation of environmental variables. Statistical data analyses show that CO 2 efflux can be considered lognormally distributed and that the process is stationary within each site but not in the whole basin, though the properties of the outcropping peat layer and the soil surface seem apparently uniform. A geostatistical analysis reveals two different spatial correlation structures, with scales of spatial dependence of ≈ 30 m and ≈ 180 m. Finally, the collected data show that invasive agricultural practices such as <b>deep</b> <b>plowing,</b> <b>tilling,</b> and harrowing, largely used in the Zennare Basin, induce significant disturbances that are not easily recognizable during the flux surveys and that casually affect the temporal and spatial variability of the oxidation process...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to find out whether fall tillage, spring tillage, or both were most beneficial for a wheat/soybean doublecropping system. We planted eight treatments in each of four repli cates. Treatments were combinations of surface and deep tillage. Surface tillage treatments were disked and not disked. Each surface tillage was not <b>deep</b> <b>tilled</b> or paratilled before wheat planting, soybean planting, and both. Disked plots had a pan at the 4 - to 6 -inch depth, just below the disked zone, unless it was disrupted during deep tillage. Treatments with deep tillage at spring only and both spring and fall had 1 to 7 atm lower soil strengths than the fall only and no deep tillage treatments. Yields were 10 to 20 bu/A higher for the <b>deep</b> <b>tilled</b> treatments. Additional monitoring of soil strength and yield {{is needed to}} find more precise differences among treatments...|$|R
40|$|Systematic {{drainage}} of farmed organic soils {{is responsible}} for the occurrence of land subsidence, caused by loss of organic mass in form of CO 2 efflux to the atmosphere. This results in an increased risk of surface flooding, accompanied by higher drainage and pumping costs. A field experimental study has been performed in a drained cropped peatland located in the Zennare Basin (south of the Venice Lagoon, Italy), to measure land subsidence due to peat oxidation and to address the primary relationships between the hydrological regime, the soil mass loss, and the settlement rate. The latter, of the order of 1 – 2 cm/year, has been proved to be related to soil CO 2 efflux due to organic matter oxidation. Quantifying this process is thus extremely important for the management and protection of these areas. A series of CO 2 emission surveys has been performed between the years 2003 and 2005 by means of the non- steady-state chamber method, to measure the efflux spatial variability and detect its relationship with the main hydrological parameters controlling the oxidation reaction, i. e., soil temperature, soil moisture, and organic matter content. The measurements, carried out in two sites located 1. 5 km apart, highlight a significant spatial and temporal variability of the CO 2 emissions. While the time-dependent behavior {{can be explained by the}} seasonal fluctuations of soil temperature, spatial variability shows a weak correlation with the variation of environmental variables. Statistical data analyses show that CO 2 efflux can be considered log- normally distributed and that the process is stationary within each site but not in the whole basin, though the properties of the outcropping peat layer and the soil surface seem apparently uniform. A geostatistical analysis reveals two different spatial correlation structures, with scales of spatial dependence of ~ 30 m and ~ 180 m. Finally, the collected data show that invasive agricultural practices such as <b>deep</b> <b>plowing,</b> <b>tilling,</b> and harrowing, largely used in the Zennare Basin, induce significant disturbances that are not easily recognizable during the flux surveys and that casually affect the temporal and spatial variability of the oxidation process...|$|R

40|$|Patterns {{of stream}} flow in {{relatively}} undisturbed Canadian Shield basins are {{closely linked to}} their physical and vegetative characteristics and meteorological conditions. The physical characteristics include topography, soil-till composition, depth and structure, slope morphology and bedrock geology. Hydrological flowpaths through, and in-situ chemical processes in the soil-till matrix are influenced greatly by the composition of these features and by the antecedent hydrological conditions preceding a given storm or snowmelt event. A long term data set, collected by the Dorset Environmental Science Centre, is used to examine eight forested basins within the Muskoka-Haliburton region of south-central Ontario. The basins {{have a range of}} physical characteristics representative of this part of the Canadian Shield. Statistical analysis of streamflow from all basins for approximately 20 years indicates that the response of basins with shallow till is significantly more variable than basins with <b>deeper</b> <b>till.</b> For this data set, streamflow patterns were assessed relative to ambient temperature and precipitation meteorological conditions. This analysis quantifies the differences between annual responses in shallow and <b>deeper</b> <b>tilled</b> basins. A new approach is taken to quantify antecedent moisture conditions in the study basins. These antecedent moisture conditions are related to precipitation magnitude and basin runoff coefficients. Regression equations quantify these relationships for the study basins and demonstrate significant differences which are related to the physical characteristics of the basin. A daily time series of antecedent moisture conditions constructed for four study basins for four consecutive years explains runoff coefficient patterns in basins with shallow and <b>deep</b> <b>till.</b> Temporal patterns of dissolved ions, sulphate (SO 42 -) chloride (Cl-), calcium (Ca 2 +) and dissolved silica (SiO 2) and alkalinity export in surface water were assessed to examine the distribution of these solutes across the range of annual storm events at each site. Storm and spring melt events that are exceeded 20 % of the time {{during the course of a}} year are responsible for the majority of solute export during a year; however, the relative importance of storm events on solute export differs between <b>deeper</b> and shallow <b>tilled</b> basins and during dry and wet years...|$|R
50|$|The Salt Lake Valley {{was founded}} first upon an agrarian system and later {{combined}} this with non-agrarian techniques {{by way of}} manufacturing {{and the use of}} the railroad. The early agrarian development began by appointing crews to “plow, plant, survey, build fences, saw timber, build a public shelter, and explore". Their agrarian system was composed of proper irrigation for successful farming of staple crops. Since it was already late in the season, being July, plowing and irrigating occurred around the clock. Between July 23 and the 28th eighty-four acres had been farmed with corn, potatoes, beans, buckwheat, and turnips. In the north, semi-tropical crops were grown such as cotton, grapes, sugar cane, madder, mulberries, and indigo. The techniques of working, <b>tilling,</b> <b>plowing,</b> and irrigating the earth for planting was vital in the success of their agricultural development. “Brigham Young stressed agriculture as the essential base for developing the Mormon Kingdom” (Hinton, 1988, p. 70). It was also stressed that as a people there would be greater success in developing the valley by working together, rather than individually.|$|R
