40|$|Electronic {{speckle pattern}} {{interferometry}} {{was applied to}} directly measure the distribution of longitudinal, tangential, and shear strains in small boards of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) exposed to tensile load in longitudinal direction. A sample with a central <b>intergrown</b> <b>knot</b> and one with an equivalent loose knot were compared with reference samples made of clear wood with an artificial central circular or square hole, respectively. The observed measurements were compared with a finite element (FE) simulation. The FE model {{was based on a}} geometric model to quantify the local fibre orientation and a micromechanical model to estimate elastic constants of clear wood and knot tissue. Both the measurements and simulation clearly illustrate a rather homogenous strain distribution around the <b>intergrown</b> <b>knot.</b> In comparison, the natural optimisation of dispersing strain peaks is less efficient in the case of loose knots. The artificial circular and square holes in samples with parallel fibre orientation lead to high gradients in the strain field and peak values in vicinity of the disturbance...|$|E
40|$|In the {{manufacture}} of glulam timbers, the laminae that have knots near the finger-joint and starved part in the finger-joint are often found, and it will greatly influence the decrease in strength of products. Therefore, the detection of knots and starved joints is important for preparation of laminae, and the method is hoped to be simple and non. destructive. In this study, sugi (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) finger-jointed laminae with an <b>intergrown</b> <b>knot</b> near the finger-joint and starved joints in the finger-joint were prepared, and the evaluation of finger-joint performance was conducted by acoustic emission (AE) as the non-destructive method. That is, bending tests for these laminae were performed, and AE generated during bending test was measured along with load. Then, the correspondence between AE characteristics and the strength properties was examined. The main results are summarized as follows: for the laminae with a knot parallel to the finger-joint and starved joints in the finger-joints, AE signals were measured at the early stage of the bending test and the accumulated AE count was large {{as compared with the}} laminae without knots and starved joints/controls. Therefore, the AE technique is promising for the monitoring of knots and starved joints during bending test. In this experiment, for the laminae with a knot, the difference of the bending strength was not admitted. From this result, the bending strength was almost unaffected by the difference of the knot position near finger-joint. For the laminae with starved-joints, the MOE was almost unaffected by the presence of the starved joints, while the MOR decreased slightly as compared with the controls. It follows from the above results that the AE technique is promising for the detection of knot parallel to the finger-joint and starved joints in the finger-joint at the early stage of the bending test, even if the knot and starved joints do not cause much reduction in the bending strength...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} on 9 sample of Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst] trees, aged 150 years, from three upper subalpine stands {{in the region of}} the Dolomites. The knots were classified into three categories of healthiness and three categories of intergrowth with the surrounding wood. Differences in diameters and relative diameters of knots classified into three categories of healthiness and three categories of intergrowth with the surrounding wood was shown on a merchantable bole divided into 10 equal sections. The frequency of occurrence of knots under the analysed categories was the basis for distinguishing zones of different quality on the examined spruce stems. Healthy and <b>intergrown</b> <b>knots</b> occurring mainly in the upper half of tree stems prevailed. Rotten and not <b>intergrown</b> <b>knots</b> occurred mainly in the section 0. 2 to 0. 5 of the merchantable bole length. The research results may be of practical importance for the wood processing industry, as the knot structure in roundwood affects the quality of P. abies sawn timber. Przemysław Szmi...|$|R

Discriminant classifiers were then developed to demonstrate that an in-depth knowledge of how defect parameters relate between defect types could be used to develop the best possible classification methods. Classifiers developed using the knowledge of defect parameter relationships were found to provide higher classification accuracies for all defects and species than those which used all parameters and where variable selection procedures had been used...|$|R
