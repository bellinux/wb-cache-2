As a result of international cooperation, Comet Halley was explored during its recent appearance from the ground, earth orbit, Venus orbit, interplanetary space, and from within the comet itself.

The Vega trajectory data and the Halley camera angle data were combined to improve the comet orbit accuracy. This was used to improve the Giotto fly-by targeting. The DSN performed delta DOR (VLBI) and one-way Doppler measurements of the Vega spacecraft for orbit determination.

40|$|ESA has {{developed}} standards for packet telemetry and telecommand, which {{are derived from}} {{the recommendations of the}} <b>Inter-Agency</b> <b>Consultative</b> Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS). These standards are now mandatory for future ESA programs as well as for many programs currently under development. However, while these packet standards address the end-to-end transfer of telemetry and telecommand data between applications on the ground and Application Processes on-board, they leave open the internal structure or content of the packets. This paper presents the ESA Packet Utilization Standard (PUS) which addresses this very subject and, as such, serves to extend and complement the ESA packet standards. The goal of the PUS is to be applicable to future ESA missions in all application areas (Telecommunications, Science, Earth Resources, microgravity, etc.). The production of the PUS falls under the responsibility of the ESA Committee for Operations and EGSE Standards (COES) ...|$|R
