5|$|A strain is a {{subgroup}} {{within the}} species that has unique characteristics that distinguish it from other strains. These differences are often detectable only at the molecular level; however, they may result in changes to the physiology or lifecycle of the bacterium. For example, a strain may gain pathogenic capacity, {{the ability to use}} a unique carbon source, the ability to take upon a particular ecological niche, or the ability to resist antimicrobial agents. Different strains of E. coli are often host-specific, making it possible to determine the source of fecal contamination in environmental samples. For example, <b>knowing</b> <b>which</b> E. coli strains are present in a water sample allows researchers to make assumptions about whether the contamination originated from a human, another mammal, or a bird.|$|E
5|$|Meena takes Rahul to {{her father}} and {{introduces}} him as her lover. Tangaballi challenges Rahul to a duel that Rahul unknowingly accepts, due to his lack of knowledge in Tamil. On {{the night of the}} duel, Rahul escapes {{with the help of a}} local policeman, Shamsher (Mukesh Tiwari), but he ends up on a ship with Sri Lankan terrorists and smugglers. A gun battle ensues between the police force and the terrorists. When the police officers investigate and take Rahul into custody, he tells his story and ends up back in Komban. Terrified and once again surrounded by Azhagusundaram's sickle-wielding henchmen, Rahul pretends to take Meena hostage and escapes with her in her father's car, battling Azhagasundaram's men. When the car breaks down, Rahul and Meena quarrel and part ways. Rahul, not <b>knowing</b> <b>which</b> way to go, returns to Meena, who takes him to the Vidhamba village. Meena tells the villagers that they are a married couple who needs protection and rest, to which the villagers agree.|$|E
5|$|By 11:04, Lindmayr's Dorniers {{had reached}} Calais. Wing Commander Lord Willoughby de Broke, Park’s senior fighter controller, watched with the Prime Minister and Park as the Germans moved closer. De Broke {{had a problem}} of his own. He {{had no way of}} <b>knowing</b> <b>which</b> plots {{represented}} bombers and fighters. Bombers had to be intercepted, fighters could be ignored. The trick was to strike a balance and time the interception as well as possible. On one hand he must scramble early and allow enough time to get into a favourable attack position; {{but on the other hand}} he had to avoid scrambling them too early lest the fighters run short of fuel before they met the enemy. Park joined de Broke. After a brief discussion he decided to commit several squadrons from RAF Biggin Hill. Park realised the raid could be a trap. Though the target seemed to be London, the aircraft, comprising 120–150 in number, may be an advanced guard of Bf 109s sent to clear the skies or disrupt fighter defences. Still, he gambled and sent nine squadrons into action at 11:15.|$|E

25|$|E. japonica {{is a very}} large, thickset baleen whale. It {{very closely}} resembles the North Atlantic right whale (E. glacialis) the {{southern}} right whale (E. australis), so much so they were long thought to be just one species. Indeed, without <b>knowing</b> <b>which</b> ocean an individual came from, the physical similarities are so extensive that individuals can only be identified to species by genetic analysis. Relative to the other right whale species, E. japonica may be slightly larger. Like other baleen whales, female North Pacific right whales are larger than males. Also, North Pacific brindle-colored individuals are less common than they are among southern right whales.|$|E
25|$|Not <b>knowing</b> <b>which</b> Hutt is {{involved}} with the Bando Gora, the pair split up to question the two Hutts, Jabba and Gardulla. After killing Longo Two-Gun and his gang and collecting Jabba's bounty on them, Jango questions him and finds Jabba to be uninvolved, with Jabba asking for Jango to kill Gardulla. Fett proceeds to Gardulla's palace through the Jundland wastes, battling Tusken Raiders and Gardulla's guards, before finding Wesell in a holding cell. He tries to leave her there to avoid sounding an alarm, but she compromises his position, and he is apprehended. After escaping detainment, Fett reaches Gardulla, who refuses to give up Vosa's location. Fett then feeds Gardulla to her own Krayt dragon, before finishing the Krayt dragon off himself. Out of anger for her betrayal, he leaves Wesell on Tatooine to continue searching for Vosa alone. Fett contacts Rozatta, but Montross is listening in and attacks the station, rigging it to explode. Montross then taunts Fett, telling him that his friend is in danger. Fett temporarily abandons his mission to help Rozatta. He arrives to a fatally wounded Rozatta, who gives him a guidance device to help him track Vosa before she dies. Fett leaves Outland Station, with it exploding moments later.|$|E
500|$|The {{complexity}} of the pilot's script (and the show's concept) was cited as a potential issue for the series. Salke considered that viewers enjoyed the series' mythology as it affected the characters, despite the show's Sliding Doors–like script. Upon reading the script, Isaacs felt that the show was complicated; <b>knowing</b> <b>which</b> reality you are in was a [...] "gift." [...] He stated that work for Awake was hard, but enjoyable. Isaacs later suggested {{that it might be}} too brooding for mainstream American television, and that it could potentially be the [...] "U-bend of scripts." [...] Despite such concerns, Gordon asserted that the concept of Awake was understandable if the viewer was attentive.|$|E

500|$|On {{settling}} in Pierceton, Indiana, Marshall began to attend public school. His {{father and grandfather}} became embroiled in a dispute with their Methodist minister when they refused to vote Republican in the 1862 election. The minister threatened to expel them from the church, to which Marshall's grandfather replied that he would [...] "take his risk on hell, but not the Republican Party". The dispute prompted the family to move again, to Fort Wayne, and convert to the Presbyterian church. In Fort Wayne, Marshall attended high school, graduating in 1869. At age fifteen his parents sent him to Wabash College, in Crawfordsville, where he received a classical education. His father advised him to study medicine or become a minister, but neither interested him; he entered the school without <b>knowing</b> <b>which</b> profession he would take upon graduation.|$|E
500|$|Leicester {{initially}} {{struggled in}} their domestic form during 2016–17, spending {{much of the}} first few months in {{the bottom half of the}} table. In December 2016, Ranieri was awarded coach of the year and Leicester team of the year at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year. However, on 23 February 2017, Ranieri was sacked due to the club's continuing poor form, resulting in them being only one point above the relegation zone. Gary Lineker called the sacking [...] "very sad" [...] and [...] "inexplicable", while Manchester United manager José Mourinho blamed it on [...] "selfish players". Rumours began emerging some days later that players had been meeting with the owners to discuss Ranieri's sacking without Ranieri <b>knowing,</b> <b>which</b> sparked widespread outrage over social media. Commenting on the collapse in form of the team and particularly Jamie Vardy during the first 20 matches of the 2016–17 season, Alan Shearer said Vardy had signed a [...] "bumper new contract", but was no longer doing what brought him success last season, and that the entire club was [...] "no longer doing the basics".|$|E
500|$|Another {{question}} that arose was whether Lody's trial {{should be held}} in public or in camera. Captain Reginald Drake, [...] head of counter-espionage, wanted Lody to be tried secretly {{so that he could}} implement [...] "an ingenious method for conveying false information to the enemy which depended on their not <b>knowing</b> <b>which</b> of their agents had been caught." [...] He was overruled, as the British Government believed that it would be more advantageous to publicise the threat of German spies to remove any doubt in the public mind that German espionage posed a serious threat in the UK. It was hoped that this would also generate support for the intelligence and censorship apparatus that was rapidly taking shape and would deter possible imitators. In the event, Lody's was the only spy trial in either World War held in public in the UK. In pursuing this policy the Government sacrificed the chance to [...] "turn" [...] captured spies and turn them into assets for the British intelligence services. It was an opportunity that was taken in the Second World War when the highly successful Double-Cross System was implemented.|$|E

500|$|In Malay, kuala {{can have}} the {{meanings}} of [...] "river mouth", [...] "estuary", or [...] "confluence". Thus, the name Kuala Terengganu is roughly translated as [...] "the confluence/estuary of Terengganu", referring to the broad expanse of the Terengganu River estuary which empties into the South China Sea. There are several theories regarding the name Terengganu. One such theory attributes the name's origin to terang ganu, Malay for 'bright rainbow'. Another story, which {{is considered to be}} the most popular version, {{is said to have been}} originally narrated by the ninth Sultan of Terengganu, Baginda Omar. It tells of a party of hunters from Pahang roving and hunting in the area of what is now southern Terengganu. One of the hunters spotted a big animal fang lying on the ground. A fellow party member asked to which animal did the fang belong. The hunter, not <b>knowing</b> <b>which</b> animal, simply answered taring anu (Malay: 'fang of something'). The party later returned to Pahang with a rich hoard of game, fur and sandalwood, which impressed their neighbours. They asked the hunters where did they source their riches, to which they replied, from the land of taring anu, which later evolved into Terengganu.|$|E
500|$|The pair {{initially}} traveled mainly over flat snowfields. Nansen {{had allowed}} 50days {{to cover the}} [...] to the pole, requiring an average daily journey of seven nautical miles (13km; 8.1mi). On 22 March a sextant observation showed that the pair had travelled [...] towards the pole at a daily average of over nine nautical miles (17km; 10mi). This had been achieved despite very low temperatures, typically around , and small scale mishaps including {{the loss of the}} sledgemeter that recorded mileage. However, as the surfaces became uneven and made skiing more difficult, their speeds slowed. A sextant reading on 29 March of 85°56′N indicated that a week's travel had brought them [...] nearer to the pole, but also showed that their average daily distances were falling. More worryingly, a theodolite reading that day suggested that they were at only 85°15′N, and they had no means of <b>knowing</b> <b>which</b> of the readings was correct. They realised that they were fighting a southerly drift, and that distances travelled did not necessarily equate to northerly progression. Johansen's diary indicated his failing spirits: [...] "My fingers are all destroyed. All mittens are frozen stiff ... It is becoming worse and worse ... God knows what will happen to us".|$|E
500|$|The player's {{character}} {{takes on}} the role of an adventurer in Eorzea under the Seventh Umbral Era who joins one of the three Grand Companies. The Order of the Twin Adder, Gridania's Grand Company, is led by Elder Seedseer Kan-E-Senna, an even-headed child of the forest who is blessed with the power of prophecy. Ul'dah's Immortal Flames are led by Flame General Raubahn Aldynn, a Highlander from Ala Mhigo and bodyguard of reigning sultana Nanamo Ul Namo. Raubahn climbed out of poverty through his martial skill while fighting in the Coliseum. The Maelstrom of Limsa Lominsa is led by Admiral Merlwyb Bloefhiswyn, a cunning former pirate who instituted a harsh conscription service to bring the pirate fleets under her command. Other allies include Minfilia and her Scions of the Seventh Dawn, an organization formed from the union of the Path of the Twelve and Archon Louisoix's Circle of <b>Knowing</b> <b>which</b> were active during the Sixth Astral Era.
