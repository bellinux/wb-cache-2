25|$|However, {{some critics}} did not review the film so positively. In his review <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>Times,</b> Kenneth Turan criticized Max’s overtly “snooty” {{personality}} as “too off-putting to tolerate” which could potentially discourage audiences when identifying with the film. Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film two-and-a-half stars {{out of four}} citing an issue with the film’s shift in tone in the final act, stating “the air goes out of the movie” in regards to “stage-setting and character development”. He further wrote, “Anderson and Wilson are good offbeat filmmakers … But their film seems torn between conflicting possibilities: it’s structured like a comedy, but there are undertones of darker themes, and I almost wish they’d allowed the plot to lead them into those shadows”.|$|E

SCS co-sponsored and produced a monthly series of lectures held monthly at the California Institute of Technology, other meetings were also held on the campus of Cal State Fullerton, that explained alleged paranormal phenomena such as Extra-sensory perception and firewalking. Seckel also wrote about investigating various supernatural claims from the scientific perspective. One such investigation, led by James Randi, concerned faith healer Peter Popoff, who used a hearing transmitter {{to give the impression that}} he was psychic and hearing private information from God. Seckel also wrote a column <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>Times</b> and the Santa Monica Monthly News from 1987–1989, explaining apparently amazing or paranormal phenomena in scientific terms.|$|E
25|$|Kenan's first novel, A Visitation of Spirits, was {{published}} in 1989. While a few critics praised the book, it did not receive much attention. This changed with the publication in 1992 of Kenan's second book, {{a collection of short}} stories titled Let the Dead Bury Their Dead. The stories, based in the fictional community of Tims Creek, focused on (among other things) what it meant to be poor, black, and gay in the southern United States. The book was hailed as a revival of classic southern literature and was nominated <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>Times</b> Book Award for Fiction, was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award, and was named a New York Times Notable Book. The short story collection also brought renewed attention to his first novel, which was likewise set in Tims Creek.|$|E

500|$|In {{his review}} of the premiere episode of Temperatures Rising <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>Times,</b> critic Don Page felt that James Whitmore was [...] "totally wasted in this silly exercise" [...] and that [...] "guest Jack Albertson almost saves it with his {{portrayal}} of an annoyed senator. Otherwise, the diagnosis is terminal comedy". Likewise, Cecil Smith, another writer for the Times, claimed it was the [...] "worst show of the season. Avoid it like the plague".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} watched by 7.32million U.S. viewers. It {{received}} mostly positive reviews from critics, with Chenoweth's appearance {{and the performance}} of Queen cover [...] "Somebody to Love" [...] in particular receiving praise. Raymund Flandez for The Wall Street Journal, Mike Hale of the New York Times and Denise Martin <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>Times</b> all deemed [...] "Somebody to Love" [...] the show's best musical number since the staging of Journey's [...] "Don't Stop Believin' in the pilot episode.|$|E
500|$|The loose {{structure}} of Black Lives Matter {{has contributed to}} confusion {{in the press and}} among activists, as actions or statements from chapters or individuals are sometimes attributed to [...] "Black Lives Matter" [...] as a whole. Matt Pearce, writing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>Times,</b> commented that [...] "the words could be serving as a political rallying cry or referring to the activist organization. Or it could be the fuzzily applied label used to describe a wide range of protests and conversations focused on racial inequality." ...|$|E

500|$|Writing for Slant Magazine, Annie Galvin {{opined that}} 1000 Forms of Fear [...] "should be the vessel that rockets the singer out of {{relative}} obscurity {{and into the}} stratosphere populated by those more recognizable stars who've come to dominate the pop-music universe thanks, in part, to her songwriting skills." [...] Mikael Wood writing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>Times</b> praised Sia's vocals and the production held by Greg Kurstin. Likewise, Entertainment Weeklys Adam Markovitz positively viewed Sia's voice as [...] "astonishing," [...] giving the album a B score.|$|E
500|$|Shearer {{has also}} {{worked as a}} {{columnist}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>Times</b> Magazine, but decided that it [...] "became such {{a waste of time}} to bother with it." [...] His columns have also been published in Slate and Newsweek. Since May 2005 he has been a contributing blogger at The Huffington Post. Shearer has written three books. Man Bites Town, published in 1993, is a collection of columns that he wrote <b>for</b> <b>The</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>Times</b> between 1989 and 1992. Published in 1999, It's the Stupidity, Stupid analyzed the hatred some people had for then-President Bill Clinton. Shearer believes that Clinton became disliked because he had an affair with [...] "the least powerful, least credentialed women cleared into his official compound." [...] His most recent book is Not Enough Indians, his first novel. Published in 2006, it is a comic novel about Native Americans and gambling. Without the [...] "pleasures of collaboration" [...] and [...] "spontaneity and improvisation which characterize his other projects", Not Enough Indians was a [...] "struggle" [...] for Shearer to write. He said that [...] "the only fun thing about it was having written it. It was lonely, I had no deal for it and it took six years to do. It was a profoundly disturbing act of self-discipline." ...|$|E
500|$|Film critic Betsy Sharkey {{reviewed}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>Times,</b> [...] " [...] {{elevate the}} movie beyond ordinary biography or overplayed tragedy, and give Oscar-worthy {{performances in the}} process." [...] Sharkey expressed her compliments about Leto's performance, [...] "Leto's performance, though, is the revelation. ... It's a hauntingly authentic performance; the tailored suit he puts on to meet with his disapproving father {{is one of the}} film's most moving scenes." [...] Peter Debruge of Variety said, [...] "Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto give terrific performances in this riveting and surprisingly relatable true story." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{reviewer}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>Times,</b> Robert Kirsch, did {{not enjoy}} the book and considered Fleming to be [...] "a second-rate reporter, filled with the irritating prejudices and pomposities of a middle-class English traveller." [...] For Kirsch, Fleming's style {{was a combination of}} Sax Rohmer and James Fitzpatrick, although he also considered that [...] "Fleming's wit is provincial". Writing the review for The Boston Globe, Marjory Adams thought Thrilling Cities to have [...] "an acid gaiety in its descriptions", which contributed to her overall summary of the book: [...] "it is fun!" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>Times,</b> Judy Berman {{addressed}} Safran's description of Blair during the scene. [...] "Considering how terrified Blair {{looked at the}} end of their encounter, and how quickly she got out of there, the show is sending a mixed message at best." [...] She went on to state, [...] "We have no right to expect Gossip Girl to be a paragon of morality, or even realism, but the idea that true love requires taking a shard of glass to the face is disturbing even in this alternate, soap-opera dimension." ...|$|E
500|$|A capsule {{review of}} the book <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>Times,</b> Phil Freshman commented, [...] "Using hard logic and {{crackling}} humor, a trio of Canadian laboratory researchers cogently deflates Transcendental Meditation; they spotlight transparencies in its claims and warn of its latent hazards to those in wobbly mental health." [...] In his book Rational Mysticism, author John Horgan comments that although Persinger says he's neutral toward religious belief, he's more biased than other neurotheologians and that his two books [...] "cast religious belief and spiritual practices in a psychopathological light".|$|E
