500|$|Throughout the song, {{sound effects}} {{such as a}} {{creaking}} door, thunder, feet walking on wooden planks, winds and howling dogs can be heard. Bruce Cannon, a sound effects editor for [...] "Thriller", said that, [...] "Things like the lightning {{may have come from}} old Hollywood movies – we'll never know which movies – but the best sound-effects editors do go out in the desert and find a coyote, so <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> was a real howl." ...|$|E
500|$|Chris Carabott from IGN [...] "loved" [...] Tom's first {{appearance}} because [...] "It's a great scene and our first introduction to The Others besides Ethan's infiltration of the camp." [...] Gainey found the fan {{reaction to his}} {{first appearance}} [...] "really tough", because [...] "everywhere [...] went people would just give [...] dirty looks and they were like 'What {{are you going to}} do with that boy?'", but he noted this gradually improved after his appearances in season two. Erin Martell from AOL's TV Squad listed Tom in her five [...] "most entertaining guest roles" [...] from the first three seasons, commenting [...] "I am counting his first episode as my favorite. For my money, there was nothing more disturbing than when Gainey showed up out of the blue and uttered the words, 'We're gonna have to take the boy.' I could not get that scene out of my head for days after 'Exodus' aired. Ben has made Tom seem relatively less menacing over time, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> the terrifying, bearded sea captain is still in there somewhere." [...] In her review of the season four episode [...] "The Other Woman", Nikki Stafford of Wizard called the return of her [...] "favorite Other" [...] (Tom) a [...] "highlight". Following his posthumous flashback appearance in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson", Martell said [...] "Now I feel even worse about his death. He wasn't just one of Ben's scary, Walt-napping minions. He had a heart." [...] Tim Goodman from the San Francisco Chronicle thought the revelation that Tom is gay was a [...] "unique and funny twist". Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post noted this revelation [...] "seemed a little oddly placed, kind of like 'Let's make one of our characters gay just for the heck of it' but still it's cool that the show has a perfectly normal (well for an 'Other') not over-the-top gay character." ...|$|E
2500|$|Muhammad Salim al-Hazmi, {{father of}} the two suspects, Nawaf and Salim Muhammad al-Hazmi, said that the {{published}} photos may be doctored or faked somehow. Hazmi continued, [...] "As a father, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> {{the two of them}} are still alive and unhurt, and will come back home in the near future when the truth is uncovered and the real culprits are found." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mr. Kernan. [...] "That's why <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> for them. It's some {{of those}} secular priests, ignorant, bumptious----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You were saying, lady, that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> for the {{weakness}} and helplessness of our sex, and surely you did me justice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{was looking}} through them--certainly not at them. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> of being moved about like a puppet {{in the hands}} of a person who legally can be nothing to me.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Damage is {{unequivocally}} {{my favorite}} {{album of the}} year so far, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> {{a lot of people who}} hear these songs at the right moment in their lives are going to share that sentiment. Maybe the connection will come on some late and sweltering summer night, and a teenage kid will be climbing into his car with heartbreak on his mind and nothing left to say.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} in June 2011, Kember revealed that Jason Pierce and himself had not had contact since 1990 or 1991. Kember stated, [...] "Well, I've {{been in touch with}} him, but he's never gotten back in touch with me. I sent my best wishes and stuff, but nothing back. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> isn't going to change, after all this time". He added that although he would be interested in a Spacemen 3 reunion in principle, he thought the realistic chances of it occurring were [...] "zilch".|$|E
6000|$|... "This parcel, if you will. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> I'd {{rather not}} have it knock about in a mail-bag," [...] and the Doctor told him why.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> {{that this}} wasn't in the contract, but there wasn't {{anything}} to be done. It seemed brutal to leave the poor chap alone with the woman, so I went along.|$|R
6000|$|... "He has indeed, Pathfinder; and, though <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been {{loath to}} believe {{anything}} to the injury of Jasper, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> which tells me I ought to distrust him. Do you believe in presentiments, my friend? ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Do {{what you}} like {{as long as you}} keep her out. You two {{together}} would be too much for me to-night. Why don’t you go and lock those doors? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> she is on the prowl.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] he answered. [...] "That is, personally, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> he should. But {{that has}} nothing to do with the legal aspects of the case." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I shall go with you,' she answered, 'for, except you, I {{have no one}} in the world, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> if we set out {{together}} we shall be lucky.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll wait," [...] thought Mr. Quack, [...] "until that thing, {{whatever}} it is, {{comes out of}} those Black Shadows into the moonlight. Somehow <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> we are in no danger." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> {{for those}} ships, [...] Each worn and ancient one, With great bluff bows, and broad in the beam: [...] Ay, it was unkindly done. [...] But so they serve the Obsolete-- [...] Even so, Stone Fleet! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Him? It, you mean. I was watching. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling,</b> but <b>I</b> wasn't sure. At least, I wasn't sure before. But {{this evening}} I was certain." [...] Klaus rubbed his pistol butt nervously. [...] "We're lucky. Don't you understand? Another hour and it might--" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Alone with God on this {{occasion}} I pledged my life and service anew to go where He wanted me and to serve Him with all my soul. My last earthly support had slipped away, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> that mother's God would see me through." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nicholas, you {{say that}} you are doubtful. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> before long the King will {{announce}} his intention of marrying Sara Van Decht. Will you remain even then his faithful servant?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Spooky chuckled. [...] "I've got {{an empty}} stomach myself, Peter," [...] said he, [...] "but it isn't making me unhappy. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> somewhere there is a fat Mouse waiting for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{tried to}} do the work as well as I could, sir," [...] I replied. [...] "But I don't like the grocery business, or any other business. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> I'm not made for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "an impulse. I {{can call}} it by no other name. <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> taken <b>a</b> train that leaves New York at noon; but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> this morning, which seemed almost like a presentiment, that I might be of some use to you." ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{really wanted}} to dislike this book, but I was {{completely}} won over by the pictures, design and even Brodie’s essay. [...] "I don’t want to be famous," [...] he writes, [...] "but I hope this book is remembered for ever." [...] <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> it will be.|$|R
60|$|And then I got {{a sample}} of Mulligan Jacobs. The venom of hatred <b>I</b> <b>had</b> already seen in his face was as nothing {{compared}} with what now was manifested. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> that, like stroking a cat in cold weather, did I touch his face it would crackle electric sparks.|$|R
6000|$|As the day wore on I said to him, [...] "It {{seems like}} Sunday to me. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> mother and Zulime are away at church {{and that they}} may, at any moment, come in together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Inductive reasoning, I admit, {{seems to}} have fallen down to a certain extent," [...] said Ashe. [...] "We must wait for the coincidence. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> it will come." [...] He paused. [...] "I am very {{fortunate}} {{in the way of}} coincidences." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's as they please. I don't {{think they}} will very often. I would not for the world put you against Uncle Thomas, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> I shall never get on with him. But you will never {{separate}} yourself from me, Ayala!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling,</b> the <b>feeling</b> for <b>a</b> moment that, {{notwithstanding}} the crowded room and Louis' attitude of polite attention, {{my life was}} in danger. There flashed something in his eyes indescribably venomous. I seemed to see there his intense and passionate desire to sweep me {{from the face of}} the earth.|$|R
6000|$|... "What! are you drawing {{it all out}} again?" [...] {{he asked}} in surprise. Then I {{realized}} that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> written fifty-six instead of six. I was too far gone to reason now. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> {{that it was impossible}} to explain the thing. All the clerks had stopped writing to look at me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are we not on {{the hill}} top, dear?" [...] he said. [...] "You need have no fear. Only to-night I felt that I must say these things to you, even though the passion which they {{represent}} remains as ineffective forever as the words themselves. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling,</b> you know, that after to-day things will be different." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not sure," [...] she answered. [...] "I {{feel that}} I must, and yet, in a sense, I {{do not like}} to go. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> they do not mean to let me out of Berlin again. They think that I know too much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I fancy we {{can stand}} up under the strain and perils. I think we can persuade some of these big farmers {{to come to the}} rescue if we {{encounter}} any walruses or crocodiles among the wheat. And <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> if we ever get stuck, our friend of the Teal bug will help us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, yes. Well, {{it sounds}} all right," [...] I said, though {{still a bit}} doubtfully. [...] "Quite {{possibly}} it may come off. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> it will slip up somewhere. However, I am {{in no position to}} cavil at even a 100 to 1 shot. I will adopt this policy of yours, Jeeves, though, as I say, with misgivings. At what hour would you suggest bonging the bell?" ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the height}} of the gusts, in my high position, where the seas did not break, I found myself {{compelled}} to cling tightly to the rail to escape being blown away. My face was stung to severe pain by the high-driving spindrift, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> that the wind was blowing the cobwebs out of my sleep-starved brain.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> {{extraordinary}} <b>feeling</b> of <b>having</b> {{come out}} of things, of being outside.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> that, through them, he {{was trying}} to force remembrance of himself upon me.

It came to me as a physical relief when a spasm of pain caused him to turn his eyes away from me.|$|R
