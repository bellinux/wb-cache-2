5|$|Dairying is only {{economic}} in Wales with {{a sufficiently}} large herd in a productive lowland area. Hand-milking a few cows in a byre <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> {{the past and}} nowadays herds are milked by machine in modern parlours, {{two or three times}} a day. The milk passes by pipeline to the cooler and is stored in a refrigerated bulk tank and collected by milk tanker daily. In general, the cows graze outdoors in summer and spend their winter under cover, often in cubicles, the bulk of their feed being silage. Milk prices barely cover the costs of production, margins are tight, and there are fewer family-run dairy farms each year. In 2014, there were 1855 milk-producers in Wales, an annual decline of 1.23% since 2011, but the number of cows milked was nearly static at 223,000.|$|E

There have been several incidents involving abuse of low caste British Hindus, known as Dalits, by higher caste individuals in schools and workplaces. However, other Hindus say that caste discrimination <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> the past in Britain, and that the Asian community has moved on.|$|E

The moment when Michael Bryant has found the treasure and ... is obviously losing his wits. He just says, rationally, 'It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> slime, I think.

500|$|O'Neill {{was highly}} {{regarded}} for his style and entertainment values. Teammate Alan Davidson said [...] "once set {{he was the}} most exhilarating player you'd ever want to see—he was dynamite. He'd play attacking shots off balls other people would only think of defending. He had wonderful skill and technique. His shots off the back foot down the ground off fast bowlers—you can't really describe how good they were." [...] His captain for Australia and New South Wales, Richie Benaud said that he was [...] "one of the greatest entertainers we've had in Australian cricket". O'Neill's style led the British writer EW Swanton to say [...] "the art of batting, he reminded us, was not dead, merely inexplicably dormant" [...] Wisden opined that [...] "A high innings by O'Neill <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> masterful beauty.

500|$|Commentators {{have noted}} a resurgent {{interest}} from citizens in renewing their BNO passports {{as they are}} feeling insecure in having a Hong Kong passport. Legal experts have become increasingly concerned at the reach of Chinese law enforcement. Jerome A. Cohen, expert in Chinese law at New York University, said China's increasing assertiveness in the world represents [...] "not only the extending reach of Chinese law, but the extending reach of Chinese lawlessness." [...] Willy Lam, professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, warned: [...] "Not just the publishing and media circles, but the entire Hong Kong society, including people who do business in [...] China, and who might have commercial disputes with Chinese companies or {{different parts of the}} Chinese government, might fear for their safety because of such a very dangerous precedent". [...] "Freedom from fear <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> the past for Hong Kong and this applies to everyone: businessmen or student," [...] said a spokesman for the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor.|$|E
500|$|For example, the {{following}} quote {{was presented to}} both groups of subjects: [...] "Only the willfully blind can fail {{to see that the}} old style capitalism of a primitive freebooting period is gone forever. The capitalism of complete laissez-faire, which thrived on low wages and maximum profits for minimum turnover, which rejected collective bargaining and fought against justified public regulation of the competitive process, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> the past." [...] When participants thought that Bridges (a well-known union leader) was the author, they interpreted the passage to be an [...] "expression of the accomplishments of labor in the face of opposition from capital and contained a resolve to defend these gains from attack". However, when Johnston (president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce at the time) was the author, they interpreted the passage to be [...] "a perspective of policy in the interest of business, especially of 'enlightened' business". Asch conducted a very similar and classic study with participants reading statements either attributed to Jefferson or Lenin.|$|E

500|$|Media {{response}} to Intimacy was generally favourable; aggregating website Metacritic reports a normalised rating of 69% based on 27critical reviews. Steven Robertshaw of Alternative Press described the album as arguably Bloc Party's finest career moment {{and noted that}} it offers [...] "sweat and circuitry, savagery and submission, and a captivating energy that's severely lacking in many music scenes on the planet". Kyle Anderson of Rolling Stone claimed that by [...] "replacing Bloc Party's distant cool with vivid honesty, Okereke makes Intimacy a confident new peak for his band", while PopMatters' Ross Langager explained that the record [...] "might not actually be all that intimate, but it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> rough, recycled beauty". Adam Mazmanian of The Washington Times commented that the album's final mix showed that producers Epworth and Lee preserved the essence of Bloc Party's signature sound—"minor key rock thrumming with rhythmic intensity"—while taking the band in new musical directions. Dave Simpson of The Guardian concluded that it would please old and new fans alike by being [...] "brave, individual and heartfelt".|$|E
500|$|Patrick Kolan of IGN Australia awarded it {{a perfect}} 10/10 and said, [...] "It's the Watchmen film you {{always wanted to}} see, but never {{expected}} to get." [...] Also praising the film along with another perfect score (4/4) was Kyle Smith of the New York Post, comparing it to some of Stanley Kubrick's films: [...] "Director Zack Snyder's cerebral, scintillating follow-up to 300 seems, to even a weary filmgoer's eye, as fresh and magnificent in sound and vision as [...]" [...] Roger Ebert gave it four out of four stars and wrote, [...] "It's a compelling visceral film—sound, images and characters combined into a decidedly odd visual experience that evokes {{the feel of a}} graphic novel." [...] Richard Corliss of Time concluded [...] "this ambitious picture <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> bits and pieces," [...] yet [...] "the bits are glorious, the pieces magnificent." [...] Total Film awarded it 4/5 stars, stating: [...] "It's hard to imagine anyone watching the Watchmen as faithfully as Zack Snyder's heartfelt, stylised adap. Uncompromising, uncommercial, and unique." [...] When comparing the film to the original source material, Ian Nathan of Empire felt that while [...] "it isn't the graphic novel... Zack Snyder clearly gives a toss, creating a smart, stylish, decent adaptation." [...] Nick Dent of Time Out Sydney gave the film 4/6 in his review of February 25, praising the film's inventiveness but concluding, [...] "While Watchmen is still as rich, daring, and intelligent an action film as there's ever been, it also proves Moore absolutely right [...] As a comic book, Watchmen is an extraordinary thing. As a movie, it's just another movie, awash with sound and fury." ...|$|E

2500|$|It was {{composed}} {{during a period}} of personal difficulty for Eliot—his marriage was failing, and both he and Vivienne were suffering from nervous disorders. The poem is often read as a representation of the disillusionment of the post-war generation. Before the poem's publication as a book in December 1922, Eliot distanced himself from its vision of despair. On 15 November 1922, he wrote to Richard Aldington, saying, [...] "As for The Waste Land, that <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> the past so far as I am concerned and I am now feeling toward a new form and style." ...|$|E
2500|$|The central aria [...] (Fall asleep, you weary eyes) is a [...] "" [...] (slumber aria).

[...] (19.10) In Yasna 19.3 and 4.8, the formula is described as having been a primordial utterance of Ahura Mazda, articulated immediately after {{the creation of the}} spiritual world (and before the material world), and that its efficacy in aiding the righteous is due to its primordial nature.|$|E

2500|$|Jaya {{released}} an album under Universal Records entitled All Souled Out, a CD album containing 12 tracks of all revival songs.

[...] She triumphs in making the material sound genuine, largely because it is perfect for her. And her voice <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> wonder.

2500|$|By the 19th century, Circe was ceasing to be {{a mythical}} figure. Poets treated her either as an {{individual}} {{or at least as}} the type of a certain kind of woman. The French poet Albert Glatigny addresses “Circé” in his Les vignes folles (1857) and makes of her a voluptuous opium dream, the magnet of masochistic fantasies. Louis-Nicolas Ménard's sonnet in Rêveries d'un païen mystique (1876) describes her as enchanting all with her virginal look, but appearance belies the accursed reality. Poets in English were not far behind in this lurid portrayal. Lord de Tabley's [...] "Circe" [...] (1895) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> decadent perversity likened to a tulip, ‘A flaunting bloom, naked and undivine... With freckled cheeks and splotch’d side serpentine, A gipsy among flowers’. That central image is echoed by the blood-striped flower of T.S.Eliot's student poem “Circe’s Palace" [...] (1909) in the Harvard Advocate. Circe herself does not appear, her character is suggested by what is in the grounds and the beasts in the forest beyond: panthers, pythons, and peacocks that ‘look at us with the eyes of men whom we knew long ago’. Rather than a temptress, she has become an emasculatory threat.|$|E
