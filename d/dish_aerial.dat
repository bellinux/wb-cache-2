50|$|The {{reception}} aerials and broadcasting aerials of {{the station}} are on a 118 m high, guyed lattice steel mast with square cross section which replaced an older 80 m high guyed lattice steel mast which was dismantled, after erection of the new mast. In addition there is a <b>dish</b> <b>aerial</b> on the station area for satellite reception with approx. 2.5 m diameter.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{visiting a}} property, Enforcement Officers ask {{a set of}} {{predetermined}} questions to whoever answers the door when they visit." [...] They first {{try to find out}} if the person who responds to the Enforcement Officer is an [...] "appropriate person" [...] to interview (i.e. an adult who lives at the property). They then try to find out if that person has been receiving TV without a licence. If they suspect that this is the case, they issue an official caution to the person that whatever they say may be used against them in court. They then take a prosecution statement and ask the interviewee to sign it. The Enforcement Officer may ask permission to enter the property and may examine any TV receiving equipment found there. According to the Visiting Procedures: 'circumstantial evidence of use should be noted on the Record of Interview whenever visible (e.g. sky <b>dish,</b> <b>aerial</b> lead plugged into TV, remote control on settee) as this provides supporting evidence for potential prosecution and may be vital if the confession should later be challenged.' ...|$|E

25|$|Three Nimrod {{aircraft}} {{were adapted}} for the signals intelligence role, replacing the Comet C2s and Canberras of No. 51 Squadron in May 1974. The R1 was visually {{distinguished from the}} MR2 {{by the lack of}} a MAD boom. It was fitted with an array of rotating <b>dish</b> <b>aerials</b> in the aircraft's bomb bay, with further <b>dish</b> <b>aerials</b> in the tailcone and {{at the front of the}} wing-mounted fuel tanks. It had a flight crew of four (two pilots, a flight engineer and one navigator) and up to 25 crew operating the SIGINT equipment.|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s the Space Department of the Royal Aircraft Establishment {{with its}} HQ at Farnborough, sited {{a number of}} {{satellite}} tracking and receiving <b>dish</b> <b>aerials</b> {{on the south side}} of Lasham airfield, one enclosed in a large white dome. These have now been removed, as have most of the buildings dating from World War II.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ships of}} the second {{flotilla}} saw {{a change in the}} light AA armament. The tri-axially stabilised Dutch [...] "Hazemeyer" [...] mountings with their Radar Type 282 were regarded as unreliable and were replaced by an Admiralty designed Stabilised Tachymetric Anti Aircraft Gun (STAAG) mount. The Hazemeyer's Radar Type 282 was metric and operated through a pair of Yagi antennae and could therefore only supply target range. The British design used Radar Type 262 centimetric radar with a small spinning <b>dish</b> <b>aerial,</b> which gave range and bearing and was capable of [...] "locking on" [...] to a target and could train and elevate the guns as the target moved. The British design was more complicated than the Dutch design and weighed a massive 17 LT each (compared with the Hazemeyer's 7 LT). This meant that only two mountings could be installed, to keep the top hamper within acceptable limits. These were fitted {{to the top of the}} after deckhouse. The middle gundeck, between the torpedo tubes, was left empty. The mountings proved even less reliable than the ones they replaced and led to three ships Saintes, Camperdown and Trafalgar eventually having them replaced by Mk V [...] "utility" [...] mountings, each controlled by a Simple Tachymetric Director (STD) mounted on the top of the gun crew shelter. A further refinement saw the removal of the depth charge equipment and single 40/60 mm Bofors gun from the quarterdeck, to be replaced by a Squid ahead throwing depth charge mortar. The after deckhouse was extended to contain a mortar handling room. This eventually became standard for all of the 1942 Battles.|$|E
50|$|Over the years, the {{concrete}} structure has been updated {{to reflect the}} changing nature of communications and technology. At {{the top and bottom of}} the tower, supporting structures have been attached to accommodate <b>dishes</b> and <b>aerials.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Squarial was {{launched}} {{at a high}} profile event in MarcoPolo house, BSB's headquarters. The media were invited to a demonstration {{to see how much}} better MAC pictures could be than PAL. But MAC took a back seat when BSB unveiled the mock up Squarial, to replace the <b>dish</b> <b>aerials</b> usually needed for satellite reception. The Squarial was a surprise to everyone, including the four companies which had signed to manufacture the receivers which would have to work with the new aerial. The Squarial deal, with British company Fortel, had been struck only hours before the London event.BSB was itself surprised at the press reaction.|$|R
50|$|The Mark 3 Dalek variant first {{appeared}} in The Chase (1965), with Ray Cusick returning as designer for the serial. As the production required no location filming and Cusick felt that Daleks should be shorter than an average person, he had the enlarged fenders and wheels, installed for The Dalek Invasion of Earth, removed and replaced with the original style of running gear. Greater flexibility in the storylines was afforded by freeing the Daleks from reliance on static-charged metal floors for power and mobility. For this and further serials, however, the contrivance of the <b>dish</b> <b>aerials</b> to achieve this was dispensed with. They were replaced by a steel mesh wrapped around the upper collar, over which were mounted twenty-three vertical, oblong slats ostensibly forming a power collection array (although this function has never been confirmed on screen).|$|R
50|$|On 5 February 2012 {{the last}} of the large {{analogue}} <b>aerial</b> <b>dishes</b> was removed following a migration to digital transmission. Around eighty smaller dishes remain.|$|R
5000|$|TFU {{remained}} at Defford after the war, and was renamed the Radar Research Flying Unit (RRFU) in 1953. However, the airfield at Defford {{was too small}} to allow the operation of the large [...] "V" [...] bombers on flight trials, and so RRFU moved to nearby RAF Pershore in 1957. [...] Most of the technical and domestic sites at Defford were soon de-requisitioned, but {{the central part of the}} now disused airfield still houses the Satellite Communications facility operated by QinetiQ. The various <b>dishes</b> and <b>aerials</b> used can be seen from passing trains between Worcester and Cheltenham and from the M5 motorway near Strensham services.|$|R
