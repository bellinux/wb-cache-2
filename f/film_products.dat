2500|$|In {{the field}} of motion pictures, the many-layered type of color film {{normally}} called an integral tripack in broader contexts {{has long been known}} by the less tongue-twisting term monopack. For many years, Monopack (capitalized) was a proprietary product of Technicolor Corp, whereas monopack (not capitalized) generically referred to any of several single-strip color <b>film</b> <b>products,</b> certainly including various Eastman Kodak products. It appears that Technicolor made no attempt to register Monopack as a trademark with the US Patent and Trademark Office, although it certainly asserted that term {{as if it were a}} registered trademark, and it had the force of a legal agreement between it and Eastman Kodak to back up that assertion. It was a solely-sourced product, too, as Eastman Kodak was legally prevented from marketing any color motion picture <b>film</b> <b>products</b> wider than 16mm, 35mm specifically, until the expiration of the so-called [...] "Monopack Agreement" [...] in 1950. This, notwithstanding the facts that Technicolor never had the capability to manufacture sensitized motion picture films of any kind, nor single-strip color films based upon its so-called [...] "Troland Patent" [...] (which patent Technicolor maintained covered all monopack-type films in general, but monopack-type motion picture films in particular, and which Eastman Kodak elected not to contest as Technicolor was then one of its largest customers, if not its largest customer). After 1950, Eastman Kodak was free to make and market color films of any kind, particularly including monopack color motion picture films in 65/70mm, 35mm, 16mm and 8mm. The [...] "Monopack Agreement" [...] had no effect on color still films.|$|E
