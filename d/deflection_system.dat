25|$|Nimo was the {{trademark}} {{of a family}} of small specialised CRTs manufactured by Industrial Electronics Engineers. These had 10 electron guns which produced electron beams in the form of digits {{in a manner similar to}} that of the charactron. The tubes were either simple single-digit displays or more complex 4- or 6- digit displays produced by means of a suitable magnetic <b>deflection</b> <b>system.</b> Having little of the complexities of a standard CRT, the tube required a relatively simple driving circuit, and as the image was projected on the glass face, it provided a much wider viewing angle than competitive types (e.g., nixie tubes).|$|E
25|$|The cell {{suspension}} is entrained {{in the center}} of a narrow, rapidly flowing stream of liquid. The flow is arranged so that there is a large separation between cells relative to their diameter. A vibrating mechanism causes the stream of cells to break into individual droplets. The system is adjusted so that there is a low probability of more than one cell per droplet. Just before the stream breaks into droplets, the flow passes through a fluorescence measuring station where the fluorescent character of each cell of interest is measured. An electrical charging ring is placed just at the point where the stream breaks into droplets. A charge is placed on the ring based immediately prior to fluorescence intensity being measured, and the opposite charge is trapped on the droplet as it breaks from the stream. The charged droplets then fall through an electrostatic <b>deflection</b> <b>system</b> that diverts droplets into containers based upon their charge. In some systems, the charge is applied directly to the stream, and the droplet breaking off retains charge of the same sign as the stream. The stream is then returned to neutral after the droplet breaks off.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the more}} common cell-sorting systems makes use of flow cytometry through {{fluorescent}} imaging. In this method, a suspension of biologic cells is sorted into two or more containers, based upon specific fluorescent characteristics of each cell during an assisted flow. By using an electrical charge that the cell is [...] "trapped" [...] in, the cells are then sorted based on the fluorescence intensity measurements. The sorting process is undertaken by an electrostatic <b>deflection</b> <b>system</b> that diverts cells into containers based upon their charge.|$|E
40|$|Several <b>deflection</b> <b>systems</b> for Earth-crossing asteroids and comets (ECO -Earth-crossing objects) are {{analysed}} here. The orbit deflection of ECOs {{is necessary}} to prevent a collision between these bodies and the Earth, which could be catastrophic for Earth's biosphere. Deflecting small ECOs is not a serious problem when there is sufficient time before the collision; however, deflecting big ECOs, larger than some kilometers, and long-period comets is very difficult. The <b>deflection</b> <b>systems</b> are described by mass models. Then they are analysed {{with respect to their}} cost-effectiveness and are compared with one another. The upper limit of possible deflection is given by the maximal available payload capacity of the space transportation <b>systems.</b> Four <b>deflection</b> <b>systems</b> (two non-nuclear systems) are designed for a typical mission scenario.

40|$|The {{utilization}} of ultra-short pulses (< 10 ps) {{has been established}} in several fields of laser technology for processing most different materials with highest precision. Currently, one of the key challenges is the increase of processing throughput and therefore the development of optical systems which enable an efficient distribution of laser radiation onto the work piece. The multi-beam technology thereby represents an alternative to fast <b>deflection</b> <b>systems</b> and is therefore investigated within this thesis. In particular, position deviations for several foci at the work piece are considered which are induced for example by beam <b>deflection</b> <b>systems.</b> An additional research priority is the analysis of dispersion-related effects, which occur due to the increased bandwidth of ultra-short laser pulses and especially affect applications in the field of multi-beam technology. Beside simulation and analysis methods, different approaches to increase the spatial accuracy as well as to homogenize the pulse properties are developed and applied...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} various systems for altering {{the orbit of}} near-Earth asteroids and comets (ECOs - Earth Crossing Objects). The aim of such orbit alteration is to prevent a collision between these celestial bodies and the Earth, since {{depending on the size}} of the ECO, this can have catastrophic consequences for the entire terrestrial biosphere. Whereas small ECOs can be deflected at relatively low cost fiven a sufficiently long time, ECOs with diameters of several kilometres present a serious problem. This also holds in particular for long-period comets. In addition to a description of possible <b>deflection</b> <b>systems</b> in conjunction with the creation of mass models, the systems are analysed as to their effectiveness and compared with one another. The upper limit of the deflection possibilities is determined by the maximum available payload of the carrier systems. A simple system design of a typical mission is also drawn up for four <b>deflection</b> <b>systems</b> regarded as suitable (of which two are non-nuclear) ...|$|R

It was written by Jon Ritman, with graphics by Bernie Drummond and music and sound by Guy Stevens (Commodore version, programmed by John Darnel).

5000|$|Passive {{radio relay}} link <b>deflection</b> <b>systems</b> in the {{vertical}} level {{can be realized}} by receiving the signal with a parabolic antenna and leading it through a waveguide to a second parabolic antenna, where it is radiated. For passive microwave radio relay link deflections in the horizontal plane, flat surfaces of metallic material are used, arranged so that the angle of incoming beam corresponds to {{the angle of the}} outcoming signal. The resulting structure resembles a billboard.|$|R
50|$|The game is {{considered}} highly addictive {{due to its}} difficulty level, the complete control over ball direction, power and elevation (using a Diamond <b>Deflection</b> <b>System),</b> {{and the importance of}} tactics and player positioning over the field (barging if necessary), which makes it challenging to break strong defences. Was the first game to use a kickometer.|$|E
50|$|Between the {{electron}} gun {{and the screen}} are two opposed pairs of metal plates called the deflection plates. The vertical amplifier generates a potential difference across one pair of plates, giving rise to a vertical electric field through which {{the electron}} beam passes. When the plate potentials are the same, the beam is not deflected. When the top plate is positive {{with respect to the}} bottom plate, the beam is deflected upwards; when the field is reversed, the beam is deflected downwards. The horizontal amplifier does a similar job with the other pair of deflection plates, causing the beam to move left or right. This <b>deflection</b> <b>system</b> is called electrostatic deflection, and is different from the electromagnetic <b>deflection</b> <b>system</b> used in television tubes. In comparison to magnetic deflection, electrostatic deflection can more readily follow random and fast changes in potential, but is limited to small deflection angles.|$|E

Magnetic lenses are used to focus the electron beam {{to the surface of the}} work-piece. By means of electromagnetic <b>deflection</b> <b>system</b> the beam is positioned as needed, usually by means of a computer.|$|E
5000|$|Test cards {{including}} large circles {{were used}} to confirm the linearity of the set's <b>deflection</b> <b>systems.</b> As solid-state components replaced vacuum tubes in receiver deflection circuits, linearity adjustments were less frequently required (few newer sets have user-adjustable [...] "VERT SIZE" [...] and [...] "VERT LIN" [...] controls, for example). In LCD and other deflectionless displays, the linearity {{is a function of}} the display panel's manufacturing quality; for the display to work, the tolerances will already be far tighter than human perception.|$|R
40|$|Most {{atomic force microscopes}} and cantilever-based sensors use {{an optical}} laser beam {{detection}} system to monitor cantilever deflections. We have developed a working model that accurately describes {{the way in which}} a position sensitive photodetector interprets the deflection of a cantilever in these instruments.

In addition, the model is used to optimize the geometry of such laser <b>deflection</b> <b>systems,</b> which greatly simplifies the use of any cantilever-based instrument that uses a laser beam detection system...|$|R

The present work presents extensive parameter studies influencing the cutting quality. Special {{focus was on}} the analytics of degradation and damages. Beside microsections, optical microscopy and scanning electron microscope (SEM) investigations, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to identify kind and depth of the chemical degradation. The optimised parameters were in the following proved by mechanical testing to correlate the identified degradations and damages to mechanical properties.

5000|$|The fast <b>deflection</b> <b>system</b> {{can also}} be applied (if {{provided}} with appropriate electronics) for imaging and engraving. In this case the equipment is operated like a scanning electron microscope, with a resolution of about 0,1 mm (limited by the beam diameter).

This makes it possible, e.g.: ...|$|E
5000|$|Electron-beam welding {{can never}} be [...] "hand-manipulated", even if not {{realized}} in vacuum, as there is always strong X-radiation. The relative motion of the beam and the workpiece is most often achieved by rotation or linear travel of the workpiece. In some cases the welding is realized by moving the beam {{with the help of}} a computer-controlled <b>deflection</b> <b>system.</b> Workpiece manipulators are mostly designed individually to meet the specific requirements of the welding equipment.|$|E
40|$|The Ion Beam Deflection {{provides}} the following potential advantages over other asteroid <b>deflection</b> <b>systems.</b> Like the gravity tractor, it doesn't require despinning of the asteroid. Unlike the gravity tractor, {{it provides a}} significantly higher coupling force that is independent of the asteroid size. The concept could be tested {{as part of the}} baseline Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission. The thrust and total impulse are entirely within the design of the SEP vehicle. The total impulse is potentially competitive with kinetic impactors and eliminates the need for a second rendezvous spacecraft. Gridded ion thrusters provide beam divergence angles of a few degrees enabling long stand-off distances from the asteroid. Mitigating control issues. Minimizing back-sputter contamination risk...|$|R

Computations run on personal computers that are getting ever faster and with improving graphical capabilities. Important development has also been made in the operating systems, 32 bit Windows being rather standard. The new compilers for PCs for most languages including Fortran run under Windows, example being Compaq Visual Fortran that we use not only for "console" applications (few GByte can be addressed) but also for graphics.

25|$|Some {{displays}} {{for early}} computers (those {{that needed to}} display more text than was practical using vectors, or that required high speed for photographic output) used Charactron CRTs. These incorporate a perforated metal character mask (stencil), which shapes a wide electron beam to form a character on the screen. The system selects a character on the mask using one set of deflection circuits, but that causes the extruded beam to be aimed off-axis, so {{a second set of}} deflection plates has to re-aim the beam so it is headed {{toward the center of the}} screen. A third set of plates places the character wherever required. The beam is unblanked (turned on) briefly to draw the character at that position. Graphics could be drawn by selecting the position on the mask corresponding to the code for a space (in practice, they were simply not drawn), which had a small round hole in the center; this effectively disabled the character mask, and the system reverted to regular vector behavior. Charactrons had exceptionally long necks, because of the need for three <b>deflection</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R

This is done by magnetic <b>deflection</b> <b>systems</b> and exactly adjusted rf-acceleration. Up to now the necessary control-functions were realised with analogue parts. This work describes a digital phase control system that works in real time and is used with the proton accelerator COSY. The physical design of the accelerator sets the accuracy-specifications of the revolution frequency (< 1 Hz in the whole range from 400 kHz to 1. 6 MHz), the phase-difference (< 0. 01), the signal-to-noise-ratio (<- 60 dBc) and the update rate (< 1 #mu#s) of the parameters. In a typical operation the beam is first bunched and synchronised to the reference oscillator. After that the beam influences the rf-system {{with the help of}} charge detectors and now the rf-systems will be synchronised with the bunched beam.
