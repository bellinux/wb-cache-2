5000|$|A {{cable layer}} or cable ship is a deep-sea vessel {{designed}} {{and used to}} lay underwater cables for telecommunications, electric power transmission, or other purposes. Cable ships are distinguished by large cable sheaves for <b>guiding</b> <b>cable</b> over bow or stern or both. Bow sheaves, some very large, were characteristic of all cable ships in the past, but newer ships are tending toward having stern sheaves only, {{as seen in the}} photo of CS Cable Innovator at the Port of Astoria on this page. The names of cable ships are often preceded by [...] "C.S." [...] as in CS Long Lines.|$|E

50|$|Mayo, {{a diving}} platform, was {{equipped}} with dive chambers to accommodate the dive teams. They worked in six hour shifts, and when they weren't in the water remained in the saturation chambers for the entire 28 days the operation took. The divers used hydraulic abrasive water jets to cut 26 holes through both the outer and inner hulls. The salvage divers mounted custom guidance rings around {{the holes in the}} sub and lowered <b>guide</b> <b>cables</b> to each through the holes in Giant 4. The team then used the four <b>guide</b> <b>cables</b> to lower a custom-made giant gripper, similar to a toggle bolt, which were custom designed to fit each hole, and the divers maneuvered them through the guidance ring.|$|R

50|$|The Riverhurst Ferry is Saskatchewan’s largest ferry, with {{a length}} of 35.6 m, a width of 14 m, and a weight of 90.7 tonnes. It carries a maximum of 15 cars on each crossing.

There are three <b>guide</b> <b>cables,</b> two mounted one foot from the left and right sides, and a middle cable running underneath the hull.|$|R
50|$|September 1941: During the Finnish army's {{invasion}} of the area around Lake Ladoga, Finnish forces took an island south of Vyborg, isolating 23 Soviet units who were in Vyborg port. Two RON frogmen swam to the island, laying a <b>guide</b> <b>cable</b> as they went. 50 RON frogmen followed this cable, landed {{and found that the}} Finns had removed parts from their guns and abandoned the island, perhaps because they had seen the Soviet preparations.|$|R

50|$|Rescue {{crews were}} on the scene within minutes of the disaster, with cranes and other heavy {{equipment}} being brought in the next day. However, authorities announced that they would call off the rescue for fear that the unstable remains of the store could come down, putting many of the rescuers at risk. Massive protests, especially from friends and relatives of those still missing, compelled officials to continue looking for survivors, with {{the remains of the}} store being steadied by <b>guide</b> <b>cables.</b> After nearly a week, the focus was on removing the debris, but construction crews were careful to check for victims.|$|R
50|$|The {{ride was}} based on {{functional}} parachutes which were held open by metal rings throughout the ascent and descent. Twelve cantilevered steel arms sprout {{from the top of}} the tower, each of which supported a parachute attached to a lift rope and a set of surrounding <b>guide</b> <b>cables.</b> Riders were belted into a two-person canvas seat hanging below the closed chute, then hoisted to the top, where a release mechanism would drop them, the descent slowed only by the parachute. Shock absorbers at the bottom, consisting of pole-mounted springs, cushioned the landing. Each parachute required three cable operators, keeping labor expenses high.|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{increasing}} demands {{within the field}} of automation technology in the 1980s, such as increasing loads, moving <b>cables</b> <b>guided</b> inside <b>cable</b> carriers often failed, although the cable carriers themselves did not. In extreme cases, failures caused by [...] "corkscrews" [...] and core ruptures brought entire production lines to a standstill, at high cost. As a result, specialized, highly flexible cables were developed with unique characteristics to differentiate them from standard designs. These are sometimes called “chain-suitable,” “high-flex,” or “continuous flex” cables.|$|R

[...] "The bottles help me date the mill sites," [...] he says. During forest hikes Fisher also found a foot-long twisted and melted piece of metal from the passenger plane BCPA Flight 304 that in 1953 crashed into Kings Mountain in fog with 19 passengers {{on its way to}} San Francisco International Airport from Honolulu.|$|R
50|$|The initial liquid {{bipropellant}} part of {{this phase}} was completed {{towards the end of}} summer 2014. The team is now characterizing and testing hydrogen peroxide monopropellant thrusters. These are used on the first flight vehicle the team has constructed, a prototype called Puma. Each of the four 100 lbf engines is currently being characterized in order to generate a thrust profile which will be used on Puma's flight testing. Puma was developed for constrained vertical flight, with <b>guide</b> <b>cables</b> restricting motion to a single axis. Static testing of Puma began during the summer of 2016, and a constrained flight test is scheduled for the fall semester. As of 10/22/2016, Puma made its first flight to an altitude of 3.5 feet, soft landing under its own power.|$|R
50|$|The {{advent of}} cable {{television}} would become hard on TV <b>Guide.</b> <b>Cable</b> channels {{began to be}} listed in the magazine in 1980 or 1981, depending on the edition; regional and national superstations available on cable systems in the designated market of many editions were the only cable channels listed initially, with cable-originated channels (such as HBO and CNN) - which the magazine originally promoted mainly in full-page advertisements - being added later. Channels that were listed also differed, depending on the edition. As the years went on, more cable channels were added into the listings of each edition. To help offset this, the May 11-17, 1985 issue introduced a smaller Helvetica font for the log, along with some other cosmetic changes; in particular, a show's length began to be listed after the show's title instead of {{at the end of}} its synopsis.|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} {{form of a}} buoyancy-propelled-test-body facility and some preliminary test results are described. The facility is a 26 -meter-high, 1. 067 -meter-diameter standpipe which can be filled with water or other liquid. An axisymmetric body rises by buoyancy and is guided up the center on a taut restraining cable. Sensors for measurement of velocity and displacement are incorporated into the <b>guide</b> <b>cable.</b> The standpipe is also equipped to provide pull-down and release of the test body, initial acceleration, and stopping. The confined space of a standpipe within the laboratory permits controlled use of drag reducing polymer in the test liquid and nucleus removal to reduce cavitation. The minimal quantity of fluid in motion resulting from this configuration and consequent low level of background noise allow surface pressure fluctuations and radiated noise to be measured. Preliminary measurements of surface pressure fluctuations are reported. The potential of this apparatus for future use is outlined. Office of Naval Research, Department of the Nav...|$|R

5000|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} forms of reflectometry. They can be classified in several ways: By the used radiation (electromagnetic, ultrasound, particle beams), by the geometry of wave propagation (unguided versus wave <b>guides</b> or <b>cables),</b> by the involved length scales (wavelength and penetration depth versus size of the investigated object), by the method of measurement (continuous versus pulsed, polarization resolved, ...), and by the application domain.|$|R

50|$|Telecommunications cables are {{a type of}} <b>guided</b> {{transmission}} mediums. <b>Cables</b> {{are usually}} known to transmit electric energy (AC/DC); however, cables in telecommunications fields are used to transmit electromagnetic waves; they are called electromagnetic wave guides.|$|R

50|$|Sometimes {{it is not}} {{possible}} to achieve the optimum fleet angle. Where there is no space to rig a sheave the requisite distance from the drum, two additional spooling devices are available.

Both offer a solution to <b>guide</b> the <b>cable</b> along the drum between flanges, but each has its advantages and disadvantages.|$|R
