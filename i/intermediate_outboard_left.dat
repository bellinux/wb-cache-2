50|$|On 22 November 2003, {{shortly after}} takeoff from Baghdad, Iraq, an Airbus A300B4-200F cargo plane owned by European Air Transport (doing {{business}} as DHL Express) was struck {{on the left}} wing tip by a surface-to-air missile. Severe wing damage resulted in a fire and complete loss of hydraulic flight control systems. Because <b>outboard</b> <b>left</b> wing fuel tank 1A was full at takeoff, there was no fuel-air vapour explosion. Liquid jet fuel dropped away as 1A disintegrated. Inboard fuel tank 1 was pierced and leaking.|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{presents}} the results of a brief investigation made to determine the effectiveness of a proposed emergency spin-recovery device to be used during demonstration spins of the Northrop XF - 89 airplane. The proposed device makes use of split-type ailerons deflected +/- 60 deg on the <b>outboard</b> wing (<b>left</b> wing in a right spin). Tests made on a model which represented the airplane to a scale of 7 indicated that, if an uncontrollable spin is obtained in the design gross [...] weight loading, the device is not sufficiently effective to insure recovery,...|$|R
50|$|At 23:09, as the {{aircraft}} was on course to the Trinidad Intersection, {{the left wing}} and number one (<b>left</b> <b>outboard)</b> engine separated from {{the aircraft}}. Pieces of the wing, blown back by the wind-blast, struck and dislodged the horizontal stabilizer. The right wing's planking then broke away and the number four (right outboard) engine tore away. The right wing outboard of the number four engine broke away as well, causing structural damage to the fuselage and triggering {{the breakup of the}} aircraft.|$|R
2500|$|Turn {{signals are}} {{in almost every}} case {{activated}} by a horizontal lever (or [...] "stalk") protruding {{from the side of the}} steering column, though on some vehicles it protrudes from the dashboard. The outboard end of the stalk is pushed clockwise to activate the right turn signals, or anticlockwise for the left turn signals. In most cases, the signal stalk is on the <b>outboard,</b> usually <b>left</b> hand side of the column, in both left and right hand drive cars. Regulations do not specify a mandatory location for the turn signal control, only that it be visible and operable by the belted-in driver, and—at least in North America—that it be labelled with a specific symbol if it is not located on the left side of the steering column. The international UN Regulations do not include analogous specifications.|$|R
25|$|The DC-7's upraised {{left wing}} clipped {{the top of}} the Constellation's {{vertical}} stabilizer and struck the fuselage immediately ahead of the stabilizer's base, causing the empennage (tail assembly) to break away {{from the rest of the}} airframe. At the same time, the propeller on the DC-7's <b>left</b> <b>outboard,</b> or number one engine, chopped a series of gashes into the bottom of the Constellation's fuselage. Explosive decompression would have instantaneously occurred from the damage, a theory substantiated by light debris (such as cabin furnishings and personal effects) being scattered over a large area.|$|R
5|$|As {{the crew}} {{attempted}} {{to extend the}} gear for landing, they encountered difficulties, since hydraulic power to the landing gear in that aircraft was normally supplied by the two right side engines, now shut down. The crew initially selected runway 33 for landing, then decided on runway 02, and when they realized they were too high for landing on runway 02, they decided to climb and go around for runway 33 again. While climbing on the two operating engines, with asymmetric thrust, the number one engine (<b>outboard</b> on <b>left</b> side) failed due to over-boosting, leading to a rapid loss of airspeed and eventual stall. The aircraft crashed into trees, and a fire broke out which engulfed the entire aircraft in flames and smoke. The captain and flight engineer were able to escape, but all others were trapped inside the wreckage and were overcome by carbon monoxide poisoning before they could exit, as later autopsies would reveal.|$|R
25|$|On 8 February 2005, {{on board}} an Airbus A340-600 {{aircraft}} (G-VATL) {{en route from}} Hong Kong to Heathrow, the fuel control computer system caused a loss of automatic fuel transfer between tanks. The <b>left</b> <b>outboard</b> engine lost power, and shortly afterwards the right outboard engine also began to falter until the crew began to crossfeed fuel manually. The crew diverted to Amsterdam and landed safely. The interim accident report made four safety recommendations addressed to the primary certification bodies for large transport category aircraft (EASA and the FAA), advising {{on the need for}} a low-fuel warning system for large aircraft.|$|R
2500|$|There {{were two}} serious {{injuries}} on board: a fracture and laceration of a foot, and an acute back strain requiring {{two days of}} hospitalization. [...] The aircraft was significantly damaged by the excessive G-forces. [...] The wings were permanently bent upwards by , the inboard main landing gear lost two actuator doors, and the two inboard main gear struts were left dangling. Most affected was the tail, where large outer parts of the horizontal stabilizer had been ripped off. [...] The entire <b>left</b> <b>outboard</b> elevator had been lost along with its actuator, which had been powered by the hydraulic system that ruptured and drained.|$|R

50|$|In August 2015 SRAM Corporation {{announced}} its wireless shifting system, eTap. The system had been extensively developed and secretly tested {{over several years}} from initial design to a stage win in the 2015 Tour de France. The front and rear derailleurs use direct-mount batteries and communicate wirelessly with the shifters through a proprietary wireless protocol developed by SRAM called, Airea (pronounced: area). A set of small satellite shifter buttons, called Blips, can {{be connected to the}} shift levers or aero shift module (BlipBox) and placed anywhere along the handlebars as part of the system. A maximum of four Blips can be used per bike. The company also took the opportunity to introduce a new shifting convention with this system. The right lever shifts the rear derailleur <b>outboard,</b> the <b>left</b> lever shifts the rear derailleur inboard, and pressing both levers together shifts the front derailleur. SRAM made the groupset available for purchase on complete bikes and as aftermarket components sold through dealers from Spring 2016. Eventually, extension of the system is expected to the company's lower group sets, such as SRAM Force. In May 2016 the company announced a hydraulic disc brake version of its wireless road group called SRAM RED eTap HRD. The new brakes make use of a hydraulic lever design with both lever reach adjustment and lever contact point adjustment, a first for road disc brakes.|$|R
500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{climbed to}} about [...] {{above ground level}} while spewing a white mist trail of fuel and hydraulic fluid from the left wing. The first officer had followed the flight director and raised the nose to 14degrees, which reduced the airspeed from [...] to the takeoff safety airspeed (V2) of , {{the speed at which}} the aircraft could safely climb after sustaining an engine failure. However, the engine separation had severed the hydraulic fluid lines that controlled the leading edge slats on the left wing and locked them in place, causing the <b>outboard</b> slats (immediately <b>left</b> of the No. 1 engine) to retract under air load.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of the spin and recovery characteristics of a 0. 057 -scale model of the Chance Vought XF 7 U- 1 airplane has been conducted in the Langley 20 -foot free-spinning tunnel. The effects of control settings and movements on the erect and inverted spin and recovery characteristics were determined, as were also the effects of extending the wing slats, of center-of-gravity movement, and-of variation in the mass distribution. The investigation also included wing-tip spin-recovery-parachute tests, pilot-escape tests, and rudder-control-force tests. The investigation indicated that the spin and recovery characteristics of the airplane will be satisfactory for all conditions. It was found that a single 4. 24 -foot (full-scale) parachute when opened alone from the outboard wing tip or two 8. 77 -foot (full-scale) parachutes when opened simultaneously, one from each wing tip, would effect satisfactory emergency recoveries (the drag coefficients of the parachutes, based on the surface area of the parachute, were 0. 83 and 0. 70 for the 4. 24 - and 8. 77 -foot parachutes, respectively). The towline length in both cases was 25 feet (full scale). Tests results showed that, if the pilot should {{have to leave the}} airplane during a spin, he should jump from the <b>outboard</b> side (<b>left</b> side in a right spin) of the cockpit. The rudder-control force necessary for recovery from a spin was found to be rather high but appeared to be within the upper limits of a pilot's capabilities...|$|R
40|$|Small overlap frontal crashes {{occur when}} {{vehicles}} are loaded outboard of their longitudinal structural members. Studies from the 1990 s {{as well as}} current research have found that these crashes continue to account for {{a significant percentage of}} all serious frontal crashes. The National Automotive Sampling System/Crashworthiness Data System database was used to study the characteristics of these crashes in current model vehicles for drivers with injuries (ex-cluding extremity injuries) rated 3 or greater on the abbreviated injury scale. Cases were individually analyzed to only include vehicles in which the major-ity of the loading was located <b>outboard</b> of the <b>left</b> longitudinal member. Occupant compartment intru-sion was the primary factor in the resulting injuries, showing a strong correlation between the magnitude of intrusion and injury severity. Results suggest that vehicle designs must improve their ability to prevent occupant compartment intrusion when a vehicle is loaded at the outboard edges of its front end...|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} {{climbed to}} about 325 ft {{above ground level}} while spewing a white mist trail of fuel and hydraulic fluid from the left wing. The first officer had followed the flight director and raised the nose to 14 degrees, which reduced the airspeed from 165 kn to the takeoff safety airspeed (V2) of 153 kn, {{the speed at which}} the aircraft could safely climb after sustaining an engine failure. However, the engine separation had severed the hydraulic fluid lines that controlled the leading edge slats on the left wing and locked them in place, causing the <b>outboard</b> slats (immediately <b>left</b> of the No. 1 engine) to retract under air load. The retraction of the slats raised the stall speed of the left wing to approximately 159 kn, 6 kn higher than the prescribed takeoff safety airspeed (V2) of 153 kn. As a result, the left wing entered a full aerodynamic stall.|$|R
50|$|On April 12, Pilot Freeburg, with {{co-pilot}} Joe Kimm, {{departed from}} St. Paul, Minn., at 3 p.m. {{en route to}} Chicago. The plane carried 8 passengers, 6 men and 2 women, besides a load of mail. The plane made its regular stop at Minneapolis at 3:09 p.m. and left at 3:15 p.m. en route to Chicago via Milwaukee. Approximately 45 minutes later, while flying {{at an altitude of}} about 2,000 feet in ideal weather, with everything functioning perfectly, the pilot suddenly experienced a terrific jolt. A glance showed that the <b>left</b> <b>outboard</b> motor was vibrating terribly, due to a portion of the propeller having let go. While in the act of cutting the switch, the motor broke loose from its mounting and the pilot, not knowing for the moment what its effect would be on the other motors, cut all the switches and then investigated further. He found that the motor had lodged on the left landing gear struts. Again Freeburg switched on the other two motors and still had an altitude of about 1800 feet. The plane was operating very well considering the additional resistance caused by the motor shell still being in place with a large opening remaining, due to the loss of the motor.|$|R
40|$|An 11 % scale-model of a Cruise-Efficient Short Take-off and Landing (CESTOL) scalemodel {{test was}} {{recently}} completed. The test {{was conducted in}} the AEDC National Full-Scale Aerodynamic Complex (NFAC) 40 - by 80 -Foot Wind Tunnel at NASA Ames Research Center. The model included two over-wing pod-mounted turbine propulsion simulators (TPS). The hybrid blended wing-body used a circulation control wing (CCW) with leadingand trailing-edge blowing. The bulk of the test matrix included three forward velocities (40 kts, 60 kts, and 100 kts), angle-of-attack variation between - 5 and 25, and CCW mass flow variation. Seven strut-mounted microphones <b>outboard</b> of the <b>left</b> wing provided source directivity. A phased microphone array was mounted outboard of the right wing for source location. The goal {{of this paper is}} to provide a preliminary look at the acoustic data acquired during the Advanced Model for Extreme Lift and Improved Aeroacoustics (AMELIA) test for 0 angle-of-attack and 0 sideslip conditions. Data presented provides a good overview of the test conditions and the signal-to-noise quality of the data. TPS height variation showed a difference of 2 dB to 3 dB due to wing shielding. Variation of slot mass flow showed increases of 12 dB to 26 dB above the airframe noise and the TPS increased the overall levels an additional 5 dB to 10 dB...|$|R
5000|$|While {{operating}} with Combined Task Force 151, on 13 December 2011, the destroyer [...] disrupted {{a group of}} suspected pirates south of Yemen near the Internationally Recommended Transit Corridor. At approximately 8:40 am local time, the merchant vessel M/V Nordic Apollo reported to United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, Dubai, of being fired upon by pirates in a skiff. At approximately 11:00 am, the M/V Heather, operating 30 nautical miles from Nordic Apollo, reported suspicious activity by a skiff. CTF-151 commander Rear Admiral Kaleem Shaukat, Pakistan Navy, ordered Pinckney to investigate. Pinckney got underway and launched its MH-60R helicopter which located a suspicious skiff. Once under observation, the helicopter reported that the skiff had nine suspected pirates aboard, {{as well as several}} ladders, weapons and fuel containers that the suspected pirates attempted to cover up or throw overboard. As Pinckney closed, the skiff stopped and the suspected pirates threw their weapons overboard, which were identified as five AK-47 rifles, one rocket propelled grenade (RPG) launcher. and three RPG rounds. Pinckney conduct a boarding using their visit, board, search and seizure (VBSS) team (pictured), and once aboard, the VBSS team confirmed that there were nine suspected pirates, one grappling hook, 36 barrels of fuel, and 75 and 45 horsepower outboard engines. The VBSS team scuttled one <b>outboard</b> motor and <b>left</b> the skiff with enough fuel and water to return to shore.|$|R
40|$|Mirror {{fields of}} view (FOV) of 43 {{men and women}} were {{measured}} in their own passenger cars. A manual pole-sighting method was supplemented by calculations from three-dimensional vehicle data. A coordinate measurement machine was used to record the mirror orientations and driver eye locations. The mean horizontal FOV widths were 12. 9, 25. 3, and 22. 5 degrees for the left (driver-side), center, and right mirrors, respectively. On average, drivers could see 14. 0 degrees <b>outboard</b> on the <b>left</b> and 19. 8 degrees outboard on the right. Driver age, gender, and body size did not significantly affect mirror aim. The vehicle defined the edge of the horizontal FOV in the left and right mirrors for 84 percent and 78 percent of drivers in the left and right mirrors, respectively. On average, the vehicle took up 21 percent of the available horizontal FOV in the left mirror. FOV were not significantly different after the drivers were allowed to reaim the mirrors, except that {{the outer edge of the}} left mirror horizontal FOV increased to 15. 1 degrees outboard. The distributions of mirror FOV parameters were comparable to those reported in an earlier study, but the current data are much more detailed and include the physical mirror orientation, mirror dimensions, mirror positions relative to driver eye location, and other information. Summary statistics on the parameter distributions are provided to facilitate modeling of mirror FOV...|$|R
50|$|For {{extraordinary}} achievement while piloting {{air mail}} plane No. 408H on April 21, 1933, during a night flight from Washington, D.C. to Detroit, Mich. At {{an altitude of}} 3200 feet and about half way to Pittsburgh, PA., with no warning whatsoever the <b>left</b> <b>outboard</b> engine of the tri-motored plane crashed from the ship. Pilot Carmichael adjusted the controls to return the plane to a level position {{and turned back to}} Washington. In breaking from the ship the left engine had pulled the outboard heater control open and effected the center engine altitude adjustment. The center engine cut out until the altitude control was discovered and readjusted. Realizing that he had about 100 miles to fly in returning to Washington, the pilot climbed to an altitude of 4500 feet in order not to overheat the remaining two engines on the plane. A survey of the damage was made from the cockpit window {{with the aid of a}} flashlight, from which it was determined that the landing gear had been damaged. The pilot, therefore, decided that a landing should be made at Bolling Field, which is larger than the Washington Airport, and would be more advantageous for the one-wheel type of landing which would have to be made with damaged landing gear. He also desired to avail himself of the trained Army personnel and their emergency equipment, including ambulances and fire trucks. The pilot made all arrangements for landing by radio communication and received the fullest cooperation from the Bolling Field authorities. A one-wheel landing was made with little additional damage to the ship and no injury to passengers and mail.|$|R
40|$|Mirror {{fields of}} view (FOV) of 48 {{men and women}} were {{measured}} in their own pickup trucks, minivans, and sport utility vehicles using methods previously applied to measuring mirror fields of view in passenger cars. A manual pole-sighting method was supplemented by calculations from three-dimensional vehicle data. A coordinate measurement machine was used to record the mirror orientations and driver eye locations. Mirror aim did not differ significantly by vehicle type or driver gender, except that the vertical FOV in the left mirror was greater in trucks than in SUVs and minivans, due to larger mirrors. The mean horizontal FOV widths were 12. 6, 19. 6, and 20. 2 degrees for the left (driver-side), center, and right mirrors, respectively. On average, drivers could see 12. 1 degrees <b>outboard</b> on the <b>left</b> and 17. 2 degrees outboard on the right. The FOV in the left mirror did not differ significantly from the FOV measured in a previous study of passenger cars. The center mirror FOV was smaller and included less of the area {{to the right of the}} vehicle than in passenger cars. Right-mirror FOV was similar to passenger cars, except that the outer edge of the horizontal FOV averaged 17. 2 degrees, compared with 19. 8 degrees in passenger cars. The differences in FOV are probably attributable to differences in vehicle and mirror geometry rather than differences in driver aiming behavior. Drivers were asked to check and, if desired, to reaim their mirrors as they drove over a short road route. The FOV measured on their return did not differ substantially from the initial FOV measurements, although all but fourteen drivers adjusted at least one mirror. Combined with the results of the previous study, the findings demonstrate the distribution of mirror FOV for vehicles in use...|$|R

As a result, the course was altered and the ship pointed its nose over the Mississippi River. Freeburg intended to shake the motor off the landing gear and drop it into the river, if possible. On approaching a fair-sized island in the river, he succeeded in maneuvering the plane so that the motor fell off. The pilot then turned the plane around and proceeded to the Wabasha emergency landing field, about 235 miles east. The damage to the landing wheel was such that the wheel would not revolve and the tire was cut open. But a safe landing was made without any further damage.The incident had already been reported to the operating headquarters at St. Paul by radio at the time of occurrence, and a relief ship was immediately dispatched to Wabasha, where pilots Freeburg and Kimm transferred their passengers and mail and continued the trip to Chicago. One of the distinguished features of this occurrence is the fact that during all of this time, Pilot Freeburg was talking into his radio phone, advising St. Paul of what had happened and outlining what he was attempting to do.
