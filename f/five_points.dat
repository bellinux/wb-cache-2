5|$|<b>Five</b> <b>Points</b> {{is a small}} {{commercial}} district {{centered on}} and around the five-way intersection between Park, Lomax, and Margaret Streets. The area was originally residential, but transitioned to commercial uses after World War I and several retail buildings were constructed. The Park Arcade Building, an Italian Renaissance revival structure with storefronts marked by variant rooflines, set the architectural tone for the district when it was completed in 1928. Other notable features include Sun-Ray Cinema, formerly Riverside Theater, which opened in 1927 as the first movie theater in Florida equipped to show talking pictures. Over the last several decades, <b>Five</b> <b>Points</b> has become known for its edgy, bohemian character and many independent shops, restaurants and businesses.|$|E

40|$|Multi-item {{rating scales}} are popular in {{management}} research where many variables like customer satisfaction, service quality etc. are measured as respondent’s rating {{in response to}} statements or questions. <b>Five</b> <b>point</b> and four point scales are quite common {{and there is no}} consensus among researchers which of these formats is superior. This study compares the scale characteristics when the same instrument is used with a <b>five</b> <b>point</b> and four point scale. An experimental study was designed where the same items were organized into two different forms one with <b>five</b> <b>point</b> response format and the second with four points format. Respondents were randomly assigned to either one of the formats. When the data is transformed to a common scale, it is seen, that data characteristics like mean, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis are comparable indicating that there is no change in scale characteristics. However when the correlations are estimated, it is seen that <b>five</b> <b>point</b> scales report a significantly higher correlation. The major implication is that <b>five</b> <b>point</b> scales tend to inflate the reported correlations with a distinct chance of higher type 1 error especially when the variables may not be associated. scale points, measurement, likert scale, <b>five</b> <b>point</b> scale, correlation, type 1 erro...|$|R
