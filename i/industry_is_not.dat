5|$|On March 2009 the Colombian {{government}} {{enacted a}} mandate to introduce E85 flexible-fuel cars. The executive decree applies to all gasoline-powered vehicles with engines smaller than 2.0 liters manufactured, imported, and commercialized in the country beginning in 2012, mandating that 60% of such vehicles must have flex-fuel engines capable of running with gasoline or E85, or any blend of both. By 2014 the mandatory quota is 80% and it will reach 100 percent by 2016. All vehicles with engines bigger than 2.0 liters must be E85 capable starting in 2013. The decree also mandates that by 2011 all gasoline stations must provide infrastructure to guarantee availability of E85 throughout the country. The mandatory introduction of E85 flex-fuels has caused controversy among carmakers, car dealers, gasoline station owners, and even some ethanol producers complained the <b>industry</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> ready to supply enough ethanol for the new E85 fleet.|$|E

25|$|<b>Industry</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> as well {{developed}} here {{as in other}} parts of the state although it provides about 33% of the jobs. One important industry is the production of electrical energy. Other industries include metal products, food processing, wood products and mineral processing. The area is known for the crafting of objects from brass and glass. Two notable artisans here are the brothers Marcelino and Abeck Leon Rosa, who produce handmade glass items. They began producing pieces in the courtyard of their home, but today they have a studio with two large workshops and operate a school for glassmakers, which trains about 50 people per year. One of their specialties is Tiffany-style lamps.|$|E
25|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} for glass making during the Roman period is scarce, but by drawing comparisons with the later Islamic and Byzantine periods, {{it is clear}} that glass making was a significant industry. By the end of the Roman period glass was being produced in large quantities contained in tanks situated inside highly specialised furnaces, as the 8-tonne glass slab recovered from Bet She'arim illustrates. These workshops could produce many tonnes of raw glass in a single furnace firing, and although this firing might have taken weeks, a single primary workshop could potentially supply multiple secondary glass working sites. It is therefore thought that raw glass production was centred around {{a relatively small number of}} workshops, where glass was produced on a large scale and then broken into chunks. There is only limited {{evidence for}} local glass making, and only in context of window glass. The development of this large-scale <b>industry</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> fully understood, but Pliny's Natural History (36, 194), in addition to evidence for the first use of molten glass in the mid-1st century AD, indicates that furnace technologies experienced marked development during the early-to-mid-1st century AD, in tandem with the expansion of glass production.|$|E

25|$|Multimillion-dollar {{investments}} {{beginning in}} the 1990s by the World Bank have reclaimed desert and turned the Ica Valley in Peru, one of the driest places on earth, into the largest supplier of asparagus in the world. However, the constant irrigation has caused a rapid drop in the water table, in some places as much as eight meters per year, {{one of the fastest}} rates of aquifer depletion in the world. The wells of small farmers and local people are beginning to run dry and the water supply for the main city in the valley is under threat. As a cash crop, asparagus has provided jobs for local people, but most of the money goes to the buyers, mainly the British. A 2010 report concluded that the <b>industry</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> sustainable and accuses investors, including the World Bank, of failing to take proper responsibility for the effect of their decisions on the water resources of poorer countries. Diverting water from the headwaters of the Ica River to asparagus fields has also led to a water shortage in the mountain region of Huancavelica, where indigenous communities make a marginal living herding.|$|E
500|$|Flying {{schools are}} {{commercial}} businesses {{engaged in the}} training of pilots, both for recreational purposes and for those intending to fly professionally. They make widespread use of fixed-wing light aircraft associated with traditional GA, not only for flying lessons but also as club aircraft rented out to qualified pilots for recreational flights. School-owned aircraft account for {{a significant amount of}} GA activity, both in terms of hours flown and aircraft movements. The pilot training element is regarded by the GA community as a key benefit that is critical to the supply of pilots for the airline industry. It is claimed by the General Aviation Awareness Council that 60–70 per cent of professional pilots have self-financed their flight training at GA schools, and one UK airline operator has stated that the industry must rely on 70–80 per cent of new pilots coming from the GA sector. The CAA estimates that between 1996 and 2006 the number of new professional pilots following the unsponsored training route rose from 48 per cent to 59 per cent. The counter argument to this claim is that pilots can be trained outside of the UK, and that the airline <b>industry</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> therefore dependent on a healthy GA sector in the UK for its supply of pilots. The CAA concludes that a severe reduction in GA would give [...] "some merit to the argument that pilot recruitment would be threatened", but that the data on flying hours [...] "does not support such a gloomy outlook." [...] Of course, reliance on other countries for pilot training means that the UK foregoes the economic benefit of the training activity.|$|E
2500|$|A {{credit card}} is a payment card issued to users ({{cardholder}}s) {{to enable the}} cardholder to pay a merchant {{for goods and services}} based on the cardholder's promise to the card issuer to pay them for the amounts so paid plus the other agreed charges. The card issuer (usually a bank) creates a revolving account and grants a line of credit to the cardholder, from which the cardholder can borrow money for payment to a merchant or as a cash advance. [...] In other words, credit cards combine payment services with extensions of credit. [...] Complex fee structures in the credit card industry may limit customers' ability to comparison shop, help ensure that the <b>industry</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> price-competitive and help maximize industry profits.

2500|$|The EPA waiver authorizes sale of E15 {{only from}} Sep 15 to May 31 {{out of a}} black hose and a yellow hose to flex fuel {{vehicles}} only from June 1 to Sep 14. [...] Retailers have shunned building infrastructure due to the costly regulatory requirements which have created a practical barrier to the commercialization of the higher blend. Most fuel stations {{do not have enough}} pumps to offer the new blend, few existing pumps are certified to dispense E15, and no dedicated tanks are readily available to store E15. Also, some state and federal regulations would have to change before E15 can be legally sold. The [...] National Association of Convenience Stores, which represents most gasoline retailers, considers the potential for actual E15 demand is small, [...] "because the auto <b>industry</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> embracing the fuel and is not adjusting their warranties or recommendations for the fuel type." [...] One possible solution to the infrastructure barriers is the introduction of blender pumps that allow consumers to turn a dial to select the level of ethanol, which would also allow owners of flexible-fuel cars to buy E85 fuel.|$|E
2500|$|In 1937, Turner's {{director}} Robert H. Turner wrote: [...] "All {{asbestos fibre}} dust {{is a danger}} to lungs. If we can produce evidence from this country that the <b>industry</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> responsible for any asbestosis claims, {{we may be able}} to avoid tiresome regulations and the introduction of dangerous occupational talk." [...] Despite an awareness of the potentially lethal effects of asbestos, the factory site remained heavily contaminated: measurements taken in 1950 and again in 1957 showed levels of asbestos dust in the air outside the factory roof were between 18 and 60 particles per cubic centimetre - far above the company's own safe working level of 2 to 3 particles, while a measurement taken near houses outside the factory premises was 47 particles. In August 1957, Turner's revealed that they were dumping 15,000lb (6.8 tonnes) of asbestos dust recovered from ventilation filters alone each week. The same document reported that the levels of asbestos dust on the factory's roof exceeded those in the actual production areas inside the factory. In the 1950s people living near the factory joked that the area had frost all year round and the local woods were nicknamed [...] "the snow trees" [...] due to the permanent dusting with asbestos particles.|$|E
2500|$|The San Pedro fishing {{industry}} {{reached its peak}} in the 1940s, and fell into decline by the 1980s with the closure of canneries and increased foreign competition. [...] For many years, the annual blessing of the fleet, seeking God's blessing for a bountiful harvest and for the fleet's safety, drew large crowds to San Pedro. [...] At its peak {{the blessing of the}} fleet drew 100,000 people and 200 fishing boats. [...] However, by 1987, the crowd gathered for the blessing had dwindled to 200 people and 16 fishing boats, as the Los Angeles Times reported that the poor turnout was [...] "a sad reminder of the story of the San Pedro {{fishing industry}}," [...] which had [...] "fallen upon stormy economic seas." [...] The blessing ceremony was also accompanied for many years by a festival that attracted up to 250,000 visitors in the late 1960s, and included a boat parade that was reportedly the second most photographed event in the nation, trailing only Pasadena's Rose Parade. [...] In 1985, Mary Star of the Sea began to offer a special fishermen's Mass on the same day as the blessing of the fleet. [...] At the 1987 fishermen's Mass, Msgr. Gallagher told the congregation: [...] "Times have changed. [...] The fishing <b>industry</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> what it used to be. But yet we've seen this remnant of people [...] [...] [...] who adjust to the changing conditions, who persevere in the face of adversity.
