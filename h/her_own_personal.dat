25|$|As a black artist, Edmonia Lewis {{had to be}} {{conscious}} of her stylistic choices because her largely white audience often gravely misread her work as self-portraiture.

25|$|An {{important}} psychological {{affect on}} Hilde was the coercion {{to embody the}} patriarchal fascist belief system {{of the time and}} to inculcate it into <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>personal</b> identity. She was made to feel inferior and submissive, but also encouraged to never exclude herself from a group. This personal type of fascism aided in the rally of Austrian youth to support the Nazi cause during the Mühlviertler Hasenjagd. Many years after the period of National Socialism, it was still difficult for Hilde to extricate herself from this pattern of thinking. As an adult, she still felt extreme anxiety about being excluded from groups and events.|$|E

For {{the remainder of the}} war, Watts screened the fast carriers of TF38 while their planes flew their last series of sorties against the Japanese home islands.

25|$|At {{the time}} of Bate Tichenor's move to Mexico in 1953, she began what would become a {{lifetime}} journey through her art and mysticism, inspired by her belief in ancestral spirits, to achieve self-realization. While painting alone and in isolation, she removed her familiar and societal masks to find <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>personal</b> human and spiritual identities; she would then reposition those hidden identities with new masks and characters in her paintings that represented her own sacred beliefs and truths. This guarded internal process of self-discovery and fulfillment was allegorically portrayed with a cast of mythological characters engaged in magical settings. She painted a dramatization of her own life and quests on canvas through an expressive visual language and an artistic vocabulary that she kept secret.|$|E
5000|$|While {{studying}} under Manet, Gonzalès self-portraits suggest she was exploring her {{individuality and}} identity {{as an artist}} by presenting subtle correctives to Manet's version of her.

This {{can be seen in}} works such as Enfant de Troupe (1870), which is a nod to Manet's Le Fifre (1866), while many of her later paintings involved portraits of her sister, Jeanne.|$|R

25|$|Maria Pavlovana {{childhood}} {{was spent in}} splendor. Her early memories were of magnificent palaces and lazy country estates populated by armies of servants.

25|$|By November 2005, the DVLMF {{acknowledged}} {{that the cost of}} the memorial had risen to $65 million. To boost fundraising efforts and national awareness of the memorial, the DVLMF hired actor Gary Sinise, who played the crippled Vietnam War veteran Lt. Dan Taylor in the 1994 film Forrest Gump, to serve as the memorial's national spokesman. Pope was personally responsible for inviting Sinise to join the effort. The Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) became the first large national veterans' organization to make a donation to the memorial effort when it gave $100,000 on December 28, 2005.

50|$|Lutyens is {{credited}} with bringing Schoenbergian serial technique (albeit <b>her</b> <b>own</b> very <b>personal</b> interpretation of it) to Britain. She disapproved of the 'overblown sound' of Gustav Mahler and similar composers, and instead chose to work with sparse textures and develop <b>her</b> <b>own</b> type of serialism; she first used a 12-note series in Chamber Concerto I for 9 instruments (1939), but earlier than this she had been using the techniques of inversion and retrograde fundamental to a serial idiom, and she stated she had been inspired to this by precedents she found in older British music, especially Henry Purcell.|$|R
