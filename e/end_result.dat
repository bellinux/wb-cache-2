Thus, although the Court failed to accept Black's theory of total incorporation, the <b>end</b> <b>result</b> of its jurisprudence {{is very close}} to what Black advocated. Today, the only parts of the first eight amendments that have not been extended to the states are the Third and Seventh Amendments, the grand jury clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Eighth Amendment's protection against excessive bail, and the guarantee of the Sixth Amendment, as interpreted, that criminal juries be composed of 12 members and be unanimous in their verdicts.|$|E
5|$|In March 1275 {{the forces}} of Bayan faced the army of Chancellor Jia Sidao, which was 130,000 strong; the <b>end</b> <b>result</b> was a decisive victory for Bayan, and Jia was forced to retreat after many deserted him. This was the opportune moment for his {{political}} rivals to smite him. Jia was effectively stripped of rank, title, and office and banished to Fujian in exile from the court; while en route to Fujian, {{he was killed by}} the same commander that was appointed to accompany him. After his death many of his supporters and opposing ministers submitted to Bayan.

5|$|In another storyline {{her sister}} Charlie Buckton (Esther Anderson) reveals {{she is in}} fact her mother. The reveal episode {{centered}} around Ruby interrogating Charlie about the identity of her secret child, with Charlie breaking down whilst she admits the truth. Whilst filming the episodic block, both Breeds and Anderson found the storyline challenging; furthermore they felt a responsibility to get the narrative flow and emotions perfect.

5|$|In {{recording}} Revelation, Third Day {{aimed to}} produce a southern rock album while being more creative musically; the band felt the <b>end</b> <b>result</b> was their best record to date. As a whole, the album is noted as adopting a heavier and edgier rock sound than Third Day's previous adult contemporary-projects such as Wherever You Are (2005), while the album's lyrics reflect Christian themes. The album features guest appearances from Chris Daughtry, Lacey Mosley of alternative metal band Flyleaf, and pedal steel guitarist Robert Randolph.|$|E
5|$|In the novel, the Afro-Caribbean slave {{population}} violently {{react to}} the oppressive regime imposed on them by the French colonials. The <b>end</b> <b>result</b> of this armed reaction {{is the emergence of}} a brutal regime in which the oppressed become the oppressors. Sadly, the leaders of the newly produced regime fail to break the mold imposed by the French colonials. The ruling Afro-Caribbeans end up enslaving and oppressing their own kind and the resulting social situation is devoid of any progress. Carpentier's perspective on the Haitian revolution is revealed in the way that he portrays the cyclical nature of reactionary violence.|$|E

5|$|Lloyd George agreed {{it might}} be {{acceptable}} to the British electorate.

Hence despite his best efforts, the <b>end</b> <b>result</b> of the conference was a treaty which disgusted Keynes both on moral and economic grounds, and led to his resignation from the Treasury.|$|E
5|$|Marcel Pagnol's 1953 film Manon des Sources {{was four}} hours long, and {{subsequently}} cut by its distributor. The <b>end</b> <b>result</b> left Pagnol dissatisfied, {{and led him}} to retell the story as a novel. The {{first part of the}} novel, titled Jean de Florette, was an exploration of the background for the film; a prequel of sorts. Together the two volumes made up the work Pagnol called L'Eau des collines (The Water of the Hills). Berri came across Pagnol's book by chance in a hotel room, and was captivated by it. He decided that in order to do the story justice it had to be made in two parts.|$|E
5|$|Over {{two-thirds of}} Kansas' offense {{came through the}} air as the Jayhawks racked up 249net passing yards. The Hokies, meanwhile, earned almost half their offense on the ground. The <b>end</b> <b>result</b> of the varying {{offensive}} strategies was much the same, however. Kansas successfully converted six of its 17third-down attempts, while Virginia Tech converted seven of its 17attempts. The time of possession was one key stat in favor of Kansas, as Kansas controlled the ball for 33:47, over 7 minutes more than Virginia Tech's possession time of 26:13.|$|E

5|$|Symeon's {{other main}} {{emphasis}} {{is the power}} of the Holy Spirit to transform, and the profound mystical union with God that is the <b>end</b> <b>result</b> of a holy life. Symeon referred to this as the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, compared to the more ritualistic Baptism of water. Symeon believed that Christianity had descended into formulae and church ritual, which for many people replaced the earlier emphasis on actual and direct experience of God. The Discourses express Symeon's strong conviction that the life of a Christian must be much more than mere observance of rules, and must include personal experience of the presence of the living Christ. Symeon describes his own conversion and mystical experience of the divine light.|$|E
5|$|That hops {{could be}} used for {{flavoring}} beer had been known at least since Carolingian times, but was adopted gradually due to difficulties in establishing the appropriate proportions. Before the widespread use of hops, gruit, a mix of various herbs, had been used. Gruit had the same preserving properties as hops, though less reliable depending on what herbs were in it, and the <b>end</b> <b>result</b> was much more variable. Another flavoring method was to increase the alcohol content, but this was more expensive and lent the beer the undesired characteristic of being a quick and heavy intoxicant. Hops may have been widely used in England in the tenth century; they were grown in Austria by 1208 and in Finland by 1249, and possibly much earlier.|$|E
