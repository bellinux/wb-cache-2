40|$|The {{concern to}} {{understand}} why people act {{in the way they}} do has preoccupied the social sciences since their very inception. At the heart of this concern is the question of how we might best theorise the relationship between individual action (agency) and social context (structure). This relationship is the focus of this thesis and it has been explored theoretically and empirically through a qualitative study of benefit fraud. Theoretically, four sociological concepts - discourses, resources, normative guidelines and identity - are argued to be central to the relationship between structure and agency. Taken together, these concepts offer a valuable template to explore social action in general and, in particular, why people engage in <b>fraudulent</b> <b>action.</b> The research involved in-depth interviews with a socially diverse snowball sample of 16 people engaged in benefit fraud. Three key points emerged from the analysis of the interview narratives. First, benefit fraud (and social action more generally) can be understood through acknowledging the resource-configurations within which individuals exist. Resources are conceptualised as financial, social and/or ontological and their contingent nature is highlighted. The research demonstrates how the availability, accessibility and acceptability of resources changes with time and place, as well as being influenced by discourses, normative guidelines and self-identity. Second, discourses are shown to have a shaping influence upon the normative guidelines underpinning individual action. However, this does not occur in a straightforward way, since actors critically negotiate with the discursive matrix within which they are embedded. Third, it is argued that individual accounts of <b>fraudulent</b> <b>action</b> are about much more than motivation - their primary purpose for the individual is the (re) construction of moral adequacy in the context of lives lived at the margins - socially, materially and normatively. This research aims to present a more robust theorisation of benefit fraud than much previous work in this field and, in addition, to contribute new empirical insights on the complex and contingent nature of resources and moral accounts. The thesis ends with an exploration of the theoretical, methodological and policy implications of the research...|$|E

30|$|A true {{and fair}} {{presentation}} {{of the situation is}} the standard against which all accounting practices have to be assessed. Any practice that would depart from this standard belongs in the category of creative accounting. Creative accounting is ‘the transformation of financial accounting figures from what they actually are to what preparers desire by taking advantage of the existing rules and/or ignoring some or all of them’ (Naser 1993, p. 2). As emphasised by Jones (2011), creative accounting is not necessarily a synonym of <b>fraudulent</b> <b>action.</b> Indeed, ‘managers will be happy to use creative accounting as they will be keeping to the letter, if not the spirit, of the law’ (p. 38). Actually, there exists a grey area between accounts that offer a fair presentation and those that are fraudulent. Within this grey area, accounts are managed in compliance with the rule of law. However, they do no longer offer a fair {{presentation of the}} situation. When accounts are managed, the apparent performance is modified (Stolowy and Breton 2004, p. 7 – 11).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{uses the}} works of Joseph Conrad, George Eliot, Charles Dickens, Wilkie Collins, and Anthony Trollope to examine how the financial developments of {{the mid to late}} Victorian period led authors to consider the potential social productivity of labor that both political economists and its critics had labeled 2 ̆ 2 unproductive. 2 ̆ 2 These novels, as part of an emerging mass culture, express a fascination with how different kinds of labor [...] including the labor of narration [...] can increase a society 2 ̆ 7 s productive power by creating new collective subjects, whether economic collectives like the joint-stock company, rhetorical communities premised on modes of address or forms of language, or character systems like the interlocked narrative roles of minor characters in the multiplot novel. These novels serve as an entry point for an archaeology of immaterial labor [...] that is to say, labor that does not produce an alienable commodity but rather ideas, signs, and affects. In the twenty-first century, immaterial labor marks the increased dominance of intellectual and service labor to post-industrial economies. In the nineteenth century, such labor was economically productive not just in authorship but in the burgeoning service sector of the post- 1850 British economy, which included the British imperial project, international finance, corporate administration, shipping and insurance work. Moreover, although classical economics excluded domestic service and so-called women 2 ̆ 7 s work excluded from economic productivity, the British novel implicitly recognized the role of such labor in social production, albeit not in economic terms. This work considers the thematic intersection of these different modes of unproductive labor, and their frequent portrayal as forms of criminal or <b>fraudulent</b> <b>action,</b> as an awareness and rethinking of a world marked by a highly socialized mode of production. On the one hand, it examines what qualifies as productive labor in political economy, marginal utility theory, and Marxist economics. On the other hand, it examines changes in narrative form and rhetorical construction within the novels themselves in light of such economic work to describe the proliferation of minor characters in these novels as well as their reliance on sentimental modes of recognition within narrative construction...|$|E

40|$|The {{covered warrant}} {{market in the}} UK has gained in {{popularity}} over time since first launched in 2002. This has opened up an alternative investment choice which offers derivative securities with a life of typically one to two years. It seems to fulfill many of the functions of a traded options market. Since most research {{has been focused on}} options trading, the investigation on covered warrants trading is still very limited. This is also largely {{due to the lack of}} readily available data for end-traded covered warrants and the existing covered warrants. A unique set of hand-collected data, supplemented by public and private data from main covered warrants issuer and the financial database are employed, making this thesis possible. The sample periods can be divided into two separate sets. The UK covered warrants trading during the period July 2004 - December 2006 are used to examine the impact of warrant introduction and expiration on the price, volume and volatility of the underlying securities. For the introduction analyses, both the announcement and listing of covered warrants have negative impacts on the price of underlying securities for both call and put features, though the impact of the announcement is more pronounced than that of the listing. These affects are temporary and do not persist much beyond the introduction of the warrants. Negative price impacts of the expiration event are also reported for both call and put covered warrants. However, this study finds no significant impacts on the volume of underlying securities trading from the announcement, listing and expiration of call and put covered warrants. Further evidence indicates an increase in volatility of the underlying securities during the announcement and listing of covered warrants. The results hold true for both call and put warrants cases. On the other hand, a decreasing stock volatility is found as a consequence of the expiration of both call and put covered warrants. The second data set involves the call covered warrants traded in the UK market between April 2007 and December 2008; this was analysed for evidence of the best appropriate covered warrants pricing model. This study suggests default risk as a major concern for the warrant price which is called the Vulnerable warrant price. The reasons behind this arise from concern about the issuer’s creditworthiness due to traders’ <b>fraudulent</b> <b>action</b> and the recent subprime problem, the difficulties of dynamic hedging by issuers because of market imperfections, as well as the no guarantees on covered warrant trading provided by the London Stock Exchange. The most salient findings of the study are the following. The Vulnerable warrant price is generally lower than both the Black-Scholes price and warrant market price throughout the warrant’s lifetime. The evidence suggests an overvalued warrant price in the UK market. Moreover, the in-the-money warrants indicate a higher rate of default in comparison to the out-of-the-money warrants. An additional finding shows that the market becomes aware of the default risk only on a short-term basis. The presentation of negative abnormal returns of both market and the Black-Sholes prices support the assumption that default risk is a relevant factor in pricing the UK covered warrants. These findings add to the literature dealing with the effect of derivatives trading on the underlying securities as well as providing more empirical evidence on a particular covered warrant market. This could be of interest not only for practitioners to widen their investment opportunities but also for regulators to have this as a guideline for their future related policies planning.

40|$|In the {{financial}} services sector, {{the failure of a}} single institution can have a compounding effect on the sector, and on national and global economies. In particular, there is systemic risk from inter-institution lending, and this effect is more complex in Australia due to the small number of major players. In retail banking in Australia, following a similar practice in most developed countries, if an unsecured creditor is a retail depositor, their deposit is insured by the government. That is, if a retail bank fails, the Federal Government will make the depositors whole. The regulatory system, particularly the prudential regulatory system, is designed to protect depositors’ and borrowers’ interests, and this protects the interest of the government. The effect is that regulatory policy on banking has prioritised stability in consideration of the sovereign risk associated with the risk of retail bank failure. However, this approach also creates a policy dilemma. The dilemma concerns {{the extent to which the}} retail banking sector can attain the benefits of the vigorous rivalry from effective and efficient competition, without unduly risking stability and the potential of a devastating call on the public purse. Specifically, in the context of effective and efficient competition, there is limited competitiveness in retail banking in Australia. This is reflected in the static state of market share between the four major banks, and very slow and marginal improvements gains even by strong second tier competitors. Furthermore, the retail banking sector’s capacity for product and service innovation is limited. Although the absence of vigorous rivalry is conducive to stability within the retail banking sector, it is likely to detract from the welfare of retail banking consumers. Furthermore, the level of innovation may not be as high as is feasible and barriers, including prudential regulatory barriers to entry or expansion, mean that the extent of rivalry is unlikely to change without some form of promotion of competition. The paper consequently makes a four-point recommendation for the removal of the ‘four pillars’ policy:  	The four major banks are protected by an implicit government guarantee that impacts market operation with little observable benefit to consumers, and may be a source of consumer disutility.   	The four pillars policy has prompted increased vertical integration within the sector, particularly in the area of mortgage products.   	There are sufficient merger protections provided by Part IV of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth).   	Competition and contestability arise when there are reasonably low barriers to entry and exit from the sector. It is not clear that low barriers to entry exist in Australia, and evidence to support this view comes from the failure of international banks to gain a significant toehold in the retail banking sector in Australia. One deterrent to entry is the regulatory focus on the four pillars. The authors recognise that this position is at odds with the view of the Financial System Inquiry. However, the rationale in the report of the Inquiry was to prevent mergers, and the current competition law achieves this objective. The paper recommends two specific policies to promote competition in retail banking without the structural intervention that would otherwise be required to improve the intensity of competition in the retail banking sector:  	Introduce bank account number portability. This would use ‘know your customer’ and central database systems in a similar form to those that have been used for mobile number portability in Australia for the last decade and a half.   	Introduce customer access to data held by banks to allow third parties to compare bank offerings across all banks.   Significantly, these two recommendations are consistent with the productivity proposals issued by the UK Government in July 2015. The research paper also examines crowd equity funding as a disruptive force in the banking sector, and recommends that crowd equity funding be permitted with the following safeguards:  	ASIC should take an active role in monitoring crowd equity funding and be willing to sue in case of <b>fraudulent</b> <b>action.</b>   	Any intermediary online platform should have a financial services licence with limited duty of care.   	There should be a cap for business raisings through crowd equity funding of $ 2 million in a 12 -month period.   Crowd equity funding is a social phenomenon. Through its use of social media, it has attracted people who have previously never been interested in investing in companies. Instead of being feared, this interest should be nurtured through the promotion of investors’ financial education...|$|E
