When you are with the person you love, you can survive any and everything." ...|$|E

He didn't say anything about it to any one, but he just started off by himself. Now of course he didn't know the way, never having been that way before, but he kept on <b>going</b> <b>and</b> <b>going,</b> keeping out of sight as much as he could, and asking no questions. Sometimes he wondered if he would know the Green Forest when he reached it, and then he would remember how Ol' Mistah Buzzard dearly loves to fly round and round high up in the blue, blue sky.|$|E
6000|$|When {{the blocks}} tumbled down they but acted after {{the nature of}} blocks; yet the hour would come for their rising so high that the {{structure}} {{would have to be}} noticed and admired. Mrs. Assingham's appearance of unreservedly giving herself involved meanwhile, on her own side, no separate recognitions: her face of almost anxious attention was directed altogether to her young friend's so vivid felicity; it suggested that she took for granted, at the most, certain vague recent enhancements of that state. If the Princess now, more than before, was <b>going</b> <b>and</b> <b>going,</b> she was prompt to publish that she beheld her go, that she had always known she WOULD, sooner or later, and that any appeal for participation must more or less contain and invite the note of triumph. There was a blankness in her blandness, assuredly, and very nearly an extravagance in her generalising gaiety; a precipitation of cheer particularly marked whenever they met again after short separations: meetings during the first flush of which Maggie sometimes felt reminded of other looks in other faces; of two strangely unobliterated impressions above all, the physiognomic light that had played out in her husband at the shock--she had come at last to talk to herself of the [...] "shock"--of his first vision of her on his return from Matcham and Gloucester, and the wonder of Charlotte's beautiful bold wavering gaze when, the next morning in Eaton Square, this old friend had turned from the window to begin to deal with her.|$|E

Ideas for songs or poems come from varied sources, but mostly from life itself. Really, anything that inspires a poet’s heart or mind is a source. Life of course is the greatest source. Second to “life” is a broken heart, unlike the gas in a car’s gas tank, a broken heart or life never runs out of gas …… it keeps <b>going</b> <b>and</b> <b>going.</b> A life-time ago, when I was sixteen, I got my first broken heart from love gone wrong and tried to write about it.

5000|$|Other long-running {{advertising}} campaigns catch {{people by}} surprise, even tricking the viewer, {{such as the}} Energizer Bunny advertisement series. It started in the late 1980s as a simple comparison advertisement, where {{a room full of}} battery-operated bunnies was seen pounding their drums, all slowing down except one, with the Energizer battery. Years later, a revised version of this seminal advertisement had the Energizer bunny escaping the stage and moving on (according to the announcer, he [...] "keeps <b>going</b> <b>and</b> <b>going</b> and going..."). This was followed by what appeared to be another advertisement: viewers were oblivious {{to the fact that the}} following [...] "advertisement" [...] was actually a parody of other well-known advertisements until the Energizer bunny suddenly intrudes on the situation, with the announcer saying [...] "Still going..." [...] (the Energizer Battery Company's way of emphasizing that their battery lasts longer than other leading batteries). This ad campaign lasted for nearly fifteen years. The Energizer Bunny series has itself been imitated by others, via a Coors Light Beer advertisement, in motion pictures, and by current advertisements by GEICO Insurance.|$|E

The school had 900 students in the years following World War II, making it the largest parochial school west of the Mississippi.

5000|$|After {{losing the}} third trial to Sallie Hillmon, the {{companies}} pursued {{an appeal to}} the United States Supreme Court. That Court overturned the jury’s verdict for Sallie, ruling that declarations of intention are ‘credible evidence’ of said intention, and that such statements of intention are thus admissible as exceptions to the hearsay rule. The Court held that often such evidence is [...] "indispensable to the due administration of justice" [...] and the truth of such evidence is an evidentiary issue to be decided by the jury. [...] This decision was quite novel, for there was very little authority for the proposition that statements of intention qualified as an exception to the hearsay rule. [...] Most hearsay exceptions (then and now) rest on the belief that certain kinds of statements are unlikely to be false even if made without benefit of oath and cross-examination. [...] It was Walters’ expressed intention to go traveling with Hillmon that was dispositive of the Court’s 1892 opinion. [...] The Court held that the declarations in the letters tended to prove Walters’ “intention of <b>going,</b> <b>and</b> <b>going</b> with Hillmon,” which would make it more plausible that Walters’ “did go and that he went with Hillmon,” which in turn would increase the likelihood that the corpse and murder victim was Walters. [...] The Court concluded that admissibility of Frederick Adolph Walters’ letters could contribute to the circumstantial case presented by the defendants and “might properly influence the jury.” ...|$|E
50|$|In an {{interview}} given to Daily Brink during the Newport Beach Film Festival, Brooks explains how {{the idea for}} the project was born. Brooks said: I was recovering from surgery and went into a very deep depression. I wasn’t happy with my career or my personal life and I wanted a change. I had literally felt as though I had hit a brick wall and was ready to give up on life. That was when I was staring at my Facebook page in tears and looking at how many friends I had, yet I felt so alone and disconnected from the world. It was in that moment I really had an intense awakening that if I was at a point in my life where I was ready to throw in the towel, I might as well do something that scared me… to connect with people face 2 face. And so I grabbed my flip camera in that moment and typed a status update that said the first 50 people that say YES I am coming to your town with my camera and spending a day with you. I had no idea how I {{was going to make it}} happen, I just felt an inner guidance that it was what I needed to do. Within 15 minutes I had my 50 people and it kept <b>going</b> <b>and</b> <b>going.</b> People were pleading for me to come to their town and I felt I wasn’t the only one who craved a little human connection. After receiving responses from more than 150 friends, the first 50 people were randomly chosen and then video journals about who is part of the project and which cities she was to travel were posted on Facebook and Twitter. The next step was to raise enough money to make the project more adventurous, exciting, and successful.|$|E
