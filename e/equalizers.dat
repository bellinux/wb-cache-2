5|$|The sound {{equipment}} {{was provided by}} Showco who used the PRISM system, which adapted the show for each venue according to its height, width and the coverage required. The sound was mixed by Front of house engineer Monty Lee Wilkes {{on a combination of}} Yamaha PM4000 and PM3000 consoles, an unusual choice for Spears's shows. He used dbx 903 compressors for kick and snare drums. The compressors were also used on Spears's microphones, a Shure Beta 58A handheld and a Crown CM-311AE headset-mounted capsule. Spears's vocals were mostly live—pre-recorded vocals ran in parallel on an ADAT machine during the shows, and were used to replace her live microphone when the dance routines became too energetic for good voice control. Spears's band, backline technicians and monitor engineer Raza Sufi were all fitted with in-ear monitors and headset mics, enabling rapid and clear communications around the stage area. Spears did not use them, preferring the ambient sound of a battery of eight Showco SRM wedges spread across the downstage area. These were augmented by Showco SS full-range sidefills and a pair of one-by-18-inch subs {{on each side of the}} stage. Sufi also used a dbx 160A to limit Spears's louder moments, while backing vocalists were controlled by a duo of BSS DPR901 dynamic <b>equalizers.</b> Effects were limited to vocal and drum reverbs. Amplification for the wedges and the FOH system were all Crown-based, with a pair of drum stool shakers completing the line-up. All the cables used during the tour were brought from the US, even in Europe, something unusual in audio production.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Basically, {{conventional}} single-carrier {{system has}} {{an advantage in}} limited power communication systems. However, the performance of conventional single-carrier system is seriously degraded by ISI (inter-symbol interference). In order to overcome the ISI, communication systems are commonly used an <b>equalizer.</b> Turbo equalization technique was proposed to maximize system performance over ISI channel. Turbo <b>equalizer</b> can achieve impressive performance gains over ISI channel. Turbo <b>equalizer</b> performs iterative feedback from decoder to <b>equalizer</b> in receiver. Because of iterative feedback, turbo <b>equalizer</b> gets better system performance according to the iteration number. In this paper, we propose a novel turbo <b>equalizer</b> for compensating ISI, which is called as blind pseudo turbo <b>equalizer.</b> Blind means that the <b>equalizer</b> is used without any kinds of training sequence. And Pseudo turbo <b>equalizer</b> means modified structure of turbo <b>equalizer.</b> Pseudo turbo <b>equalizer</b> is included with feed-forward filter and feedback filter. Therefore, we evaluate the BER performance of blind pseudo turbo <b>equalizer.</b> Keywords- single-carrier system; ISI; blind pseudo turbo equalizer; iterative feedback. I...|$|R

In {{the design of}} a spatio-temporal <b>equalizer,</b> how to split equalization functionality into spatial <b>equalizer</b> and temporal <b>equalizer</b> plays an important role to achieve eective equalization. Since the performance of spatial <b>equalizer</b> and temporal <b>equalizer</b> depends on channel conditions, such as direction of arrival (DoA) patterns and maximum time delay of incoming signals, it is essential to adaptively split the functionality into the spatial and temporal <b>equalizer,</b> according to the channel condition. The proposed <b>equalizer</b> adaptively changes its beamforming method depending on estimated channel impulse response, therefore, it can achieve high performance in various channels.

FM also keeps the tape at saturation level, acting {{as a form of}} noise reduction; a limiter can mask variations in playback output, and the FM capture effect removes print-through and pre-echo.

40|$|A {{class of}} {{nonlinear}} receivers is proposed to equalize intersymbol interference (ISi) channels in a batch-iterative fashion. The iterated-decision or multipass <b>equalizer</b> uses symbol decisions {{made during the}} previous iteration to cancel out both precursor and postcursor ISi during the current iteration. With each successive pass of the <b>equalizer,</b> the probability of symbol error decreases. Eventually, after relatively few iterations, the symbol error rate converges. The structure of the <b>equalizer</b> makes it attractive to use in combination with channel coding, since equalization and coding become largely separable issues. The multipass <b>equalizer</b> is optimized according to a maximum signal-to-interference+noise ratio (SINR) criterion, and, unlike the decision-feedback <b>equalizer,</b> the multipass <b>equalizer</b> is optimized assuming that decisions used for ISi cancellation can be erroneous. Furthermore, even under such an assumption, {{the performance of the}} iterated-decision <b>equalizer</b> can still be readily evaluated in the severe-ISi case. With a complexity comparable to the linear <b>equalizer</b> and the decision-feedback <b>equalizer,</b> the multi pass <b>equalizer</b> is shown in theory and in simulations to perform significantly better than either <b>equalizer</b> when the ISi is severe. In particular, for the long channel impulse responses we consider, the iterated-decision <b>equalizer</b> requires 2. 507 dB less transmit power at high SNR to achieve the same probability of error as the minimum mean-square error decision-feedback <b>equalizer</b> (MMSE-DFE). Even more remarkably, the iterated-decision <b>equalizer</b> performs at high SNR as if the severeISi channel has been transformed into an ideal bandlirnited additive white Gaussian noise channel (AWGN) with the same receiver SNR. An adaptive version of the multipass <b>equalizer</b> is also proposed, which does not require a priori knowledge of the channel characteristics. Simulations show that only a modest amount of training data is required for the performance of the adaptive <b>equalizer</b> to be comparable to its non-adaptive counterpart. The adaptive <b>equalizer</b> is easily modified into a fractionally spaced adaptive <b>equalizer,</b> which can compensate for a wider range of amplitude and phase distortion. The fractionally spaced <b>equalizer</b> is also generalized to the case of multichannel communication. by Albert M. Chan. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Abstract—Equalization of {{satellite}} communication using com-plex-bilinear recurrent neural network (C-BLRNN) is proposed in this paper.

The BLRNN is, first, expanded to its complex value version (C-BLRNN) for dealing with the complex input values in this paper. C-BLRNN is then applied to equaliza-tion of a digital satellite communication channel for M-PSK and QAM, which has severe nonlinearity with memory due to traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA).

[...] During the late 1980s, Shields began customising the tremolo systems for his Fender Jaguars and Jazzmasters; extending the tremolo arm and loosening it considerably, {{to allow him to}} manipulate the arm while strumming chords, which resulted in excessive pitch bending. Shields used a number of alternate and open tunings that together with his tremolo manipulation achieved [...] "a strange warping effect that makes the music wander in and out of focus", according to Rolling Stone.
