The {{excavated}} regions, where ore is extracted, are supported with a combination of roof-bolting, timber packs, backfill, timber props and mechanical prop technologies. In order to install a support system that will be able to absorb the energy released by the elastic movement of the surrounding rock mass and support the unstable hanging wall, it is necessary for the rock engineer to know how the individual types of support will react to different load conditions in order to design a safe support system. Current support systems are developed using knowledge from past experience and trial and error processes. These are expensive and time consuming methods that can possibly be improved and made more cost effective by using modern design techniques. A study was conducted to determine the feasibility of the application of Finite Element Modelling (FEM) to the deformation of a modern support unit under specified quasi-static and dynamic stope load conditions with the view to assist in the prediction of the operational performance of support units that cannot be experimentally tested due to a lack of test equipment, capabilities and facilities. The study was extended by investigating the theoretical possibility of buckling due to an impact load on the prop and the performance of the prop. To achieve this, a simulation was carried out using ANSYSâ„¢ transient structural software to determine whether it is possible to simulate the performance curve of a prop. Computerised methods were used to determine the possibility of failure due to buckling and the implications of buckling, if it occurs, on the performance of a specific support prop design. In summary this study proved that it is possible to simulate the performance curve of a <b>friction</b> <b>prop</b> design in order to compare the result obtained with the required performance, provided that the correct friction coefficients between prop mating surfaces are known. It also presents a methodology to investigate the theoretical effect of high velocity impact load on the buckling potential of a <b>friction</b> <b>prop</b> design and slender columns in general, which is highly applicable to these types of support. The methodologies used in this study can be applied to different designs of friction props, and possibly reduce the development costs and implementation time of these types of support units.

Occurring in steel frames arch frictional joints are characterized with more complex loading state than straight joints used in <b>friction</b> <b>props.</b> In the article, there is presented an analysis of the state of stress and de-formation of the arch frictional joint, which was carried out on the model of these joints using finite element method. The scope of the analysis included two methods of loading of arch frictional joint, namely its axial compression and bending. In both cases, joints were loaded dynamically with the impact of freely falling mass. Arch joints with and without passive pressure were submitted to an axial compression. Physical model of the frictional joint was developed {{on the basis of a}} system ap-plied during the stand tests. To solve mathematical model an explicit integration method was used. As a result of analyses carried out, temporal courses of force transmitted through the frictional joint, and displacements of section sliding down were determined. On the basis of the temporal courses, depen-dences between maximum value of force transmitted through the frictional joint and the height from which the impact mass falls down were determined. Distributions of reduced stresses in elements of frictional joint were also determined and the state of deformation was described. In order to emphasize the difference between straight and arch frictional joints, also an analysis of internal forces in arch fric-tional joint depending on its geometrical parameters without and with passive pressure was presented. 1...|$|R

Since the condition of the roof strata is greatly influenced by the resistance of the face props, it is important for strata control to use proper types of props in the proper way. From this point of view, underground investigations in order to confirm the resistance displayed by the face props were carried out. The resistance of a steel prop was obtained by measuring the strain of the prop, for which a couple of strain gauges were cemented onto the prop. This method of measuring the prop load proved to be pertinent in order to obtain the magnitude of the load acting on <b>friction</b> <b>props</b> and Dowty hydraulic props...|$|R

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{evolution}} of friction and permeability of a propped fracture under shear. We {{examine the effects of}} normal stress, proppant thickness, proppant size, and fracture wall texture on the frictional and transport response of proppant packs confined between planar fracture surfaces. The proppant-absent and proppant-filled fractures show different frictional strength. For fractures with proppants, the frictional response is mainly controlled by the normal stress and proppant thickness. The depth of shearing-concurrent striations on fracture surfaces suggests that the magnitude of proppant embedment is controlled by the applied normal stress. Under high normal stress, the reduced friction implies that shear slip is more likely to occur on propped fractures in deeper reservoirs. The {{increase in the number of}} proppant layers, from monolayer to triple layers, significantly increases the <b>friction</b> of the <b>propped</b> fracture due to the interlocking of the particles and jamming. Permeability of the propped fracture is mainly controlled by the magnitude of the normal stress, the proppant thickness, and the proppant grain size. Permeability of the propped fracture decreases during shearing due to proppant particle crushing and related clogging. Proppants are prone to crushing if the shear loading evolves concurrently with the normal loading...|$|R
40|$|Wear is a {{continuous}} {{loss of material}} on a surface {{where there is a}} contact between the surface of an object with another object which can finally cause a damage. Wear can be prevented by providing a lubricating oil in the two surface rubbing between each other. Lubricating oil is a kind of oil that we can use to overcome the friction in automotive engines. Now days, there are so many brands of lubricant oil That can make a people difficulty to compare between the lubricant oil whish have a good quality and the bad quality. Based on the needs of props that can compare the ubricating oil from the quality side and the major functions, props should used to reduce friction as small as possible. Because of that we did the designing and making the quality testing of lubricating oil by the method of <b>friction.</b> On this <b>props,</b> the quality of lubricating oil {{can be seen from the}} value of rotation the ring. The amount of flow that generated from the process of loading an the amount of wear that caused by friction in the process of testing due to the cylinder charge process. In this research, the tested lubricating oil is SAE 20 w- 50 lubricating oil type. We did the research with props that have been created, where each lubricating oil testing from different brands tested with the same method and process. keywords: quality testing tool of lubricating oil with friction method, friction, wear, lubrication, oil lubrication, design process. ...|$|R
