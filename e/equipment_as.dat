5|$|After {{acquiring}} {{their own}} recording studio, the duo immediately {{started working on}} new material and assimilated themselves with music recording and studio <b>equipment,</b> <b>as</b> they sought to become more ambitious artists and less dependent on other producers. The two also became more accustomed to playing live, particularly Big Boi, and André 3000 significantly changed his lifestyle, as he adopted a more eccentric fashion sense, became a vegetarian, and stopped smoking marijuana. Having dropped out months before graduation, André 3000 also returned to high school to earn his diploma during the recording of ATLiens.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} May 1941, the NDH had asked Germany for, among other things, 22 Messerschmitt Bf 109s. Instead, they {{got some of}} the {{remaining}} largely obsolete aircraft of the VVKJ. At the same time, Germany appropriated six captured Dornier Do 17K bombers, which were then supplied to Bulgaria. Romania received six ex-VVKJ Hawker Hurricanes, as well as six Bristol Blenheims, whilst Finland received 20 half-completed Blenheims, together with manufacturing tools and production <b>equipment,</b> <b>as</b> well as a huge variety of spare parts.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{it being}} {{based on the}} same basic <b>equipment</b> <b>as</b> the {{original}} Mk. IV AI, BABS could also be used with the Rebecca equipment, originally developed to home on ground transponders for dropping supplies over occupied Europe. The later Lucero unit was essentially an adapter for a Rebecca receiver, mating it to any existing display; AI, ASV, or H2S.|$|E
5|$|Federer {{began the}} season by {{changing}} rackets {{for the first}} time in his career, from his longtime frame of 90 square inches to one measured at 97 square inches. He had long been at a comparative disadvantage in <b>equipment</b> <b>as</b> almost the entire tour, including his top rivals Nadal and Djokovic, used more powerful frames of between 95 and 100 square inches. At the Australian Open, Federer defeated Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Andy Murray to reach his 11th consecutive semifinal in Melbourne, before losing to Rafael Nadal in straight sets.|$|E
5|$|Gritters {{are among}} the winter service {{vehicles}} also used in airports, to keep runways free of ice. However, the salt normally used to clear roads can damage the airframe of aircraft and interferes with the sensitive navigation <b>equipment.</b> <b>As</b> a result, airport gritters spread less dangerous potassium acetate or urea onto the runways instead, as these do not corrode the aircraft or the airside equipment.|$|E

5|$|Historical {{accuracy}} {{was important}} to many British designers, resulting {{in the use of}} genuine military <b>equipment</b> <b>as</b> models for memorials, and long discussions with committees over the details to be incorporated into designs. In contrast, the British interest in accurately depicting real weaponry from the war was far less common on German monuments, where usually stylised medieval weapons and armour were used.|$|E

5|$|Rick and Lori {{decide to}} do the {{operation}} without the necessary <b>equipment.</b> <b>As</b> they prepare for the operation, Shane arrives with the medical supplies, but without Otis. He claims that Otis sacrificed himself {{in order to save}} Carl. The episode flashes back to show Shane sacrificed Otis by shooting him in the leg and leaving him as bait for the walkers while he escaped with the medicine. The episode ends in the present, with Shane shaving his head, wiping out evidence of a bald spot of torn hair caused by Otis during their brief scuffle.|$|E

5|$|The Junior Yukon Quest, or Junior Quest, is a 135-mile (217km) {{race for}} mushers older than 14 but under 18. Unlike the Yukon Quest, the Junior Quest {{does not change}} {{locations}} and always starts and ends in Fairbanks. It is billed {{as an opportunity for}} young racers to experience a mid-distance sled dog race. They must plan a food drop, camp away from checkpoints, and carry much of the same <b>equipment</b> <b>as</b> mushers in the Yukon Quest and Yukon Quest 300.|$|E
5|$|The Sex Pistols {{evolved from}} the Strand, a London band formed in 1972 by working-class {{teenagers}} Steve Jones on vocals, Paul Cook on drums and Wally Nightingale on guitar. According to a later account by Jones, both he and Cook played instruments they had stolen. They would go to concerts, and when these were over they would go up on stage and steal as much musical <b>equipment</b> <b>as</b> they could carry.|$|E
5|$|The first troops reached Madang on 8 February, and {{the whole}} {{movement}} was complete by 23 February. Eighteenth Army anticipated that units reaching Madang, would probably have lost much of their <b>equipment,</b> <b>as</b> was indeed the case, so stores were gathered together from distant Wewak and Hansa, and collected together near Madang. In addition emergency articles such as some food, shoes and clothing were collected {{near the mouth of}} the Minderi River, supplied by the Nakai Detachment.|$|E

5|$|These escaped {{slaves were}} able to defeat a small force of troops sent after them from Capua, and equip {{themselves}} with captured military <b>equipment</b> <b>as</b> well as their gladiatorial weapons. Sources are somewhat contradictory {{on the order of}} events immediately following the escape, but they generally agree that this band of escaped gladiators plundered the region surrounding Capua, recruited many other slaves into their ranks, and eventually retired to a more defensible position on Mount Vesuvius.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{reaching}} level 3, characters may join a clan, {{a band of}} cooperating characters. A clan has a clan hall {{which can}} be furnished with beneficial <b>equipment</b> <b>as</b> well as a clan stash for sharing useful items. Clan members can chat {{with each other in}} a private chat channel. In 2008, a multiplayer dungeon was added which allows clan members to raid cooperatively in Hobopolis, the underground city of hobos. Eurogamer likened Hobopolis to World of Warcraft instances. Additional clan dungeons have since been added, including the Slimetube, Dreadsylvania, and the limited-time Haunted Sorority House.|$|E
5|$|Many historians {{maintain}} {{that given the}} massive reductions in US military aid to South Vietnam after 1973, any major PAVN offensive was bound to succeed. However, the ARVN's soldiers were hardened veterans, and South Vietnam maintained vast stockpiles of ammunition and <b>equipment</b> (<b>as</b> demonstrated by the massive quantities of war materiel captured by the PAVN when the war ended). The final collapse of the ARVN {{may well have been}} inevitable, but the end would have been much bloodier and much longer in coming had the PAVN chosen a more direct, conventional plan of attack. In fact, the most damaging blow of the entire PAVN campaign may have been the crushing psychological blow their skillful and unexpected strategy dealt to the mind of the ARVN's commander-in-chief.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) opens a gym in the building, which intrigues Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), who's {{been looking}} to lose weight. However, Dwight's gym is only filled with his farming <b>equipment</b> <b>as</b> exercising equipment. Darryl says he needs actual equipment, which Dwight finally gets, but sees that Darryl is barely using it. Dwight asks more {{employees}} to join to help motivate Darryl to exercise harder. During a bench-press, Dwight refuses to spot Darryl unless {{he says his}} motivation to work out. Darryl finally says it is to impress the new female warehouse worker Val.|$|E
5|$|Most synagogues of Kraków were ruined during World War II by the Nazis who despoiled them of all {{ceremonial}} objects, {{and used}} them as storehouses for ammunition, firefighting <b>equipment,</b> <b>as</b> general storage facilities and stables. The post-Holocaust Jewish population of the city had dwindled to about 5,900 {{before the end of}} the 1940s. Poland was the only Eastern Bloc country to allow free Jewish aliyah without visas or exit permits upon the conclusion of World War II. By contrast, Stalin forcibly kept Soviet Jews in the USSR, as agreed to in the Yalta Conference. In recent time, thanks to efforts of the local Jewish and Polish organisations including foreign financial aid from the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, many synagogues underwent major restorations and serve religious and tourist purposes.|$|E
5|$|Nansen studied zoology at the Royal Frederick University in Christiania (renamed Oslo in 1925), {{and later}} {{worked as a}} curator at the University Museum of Bergen where his {{research}} on {{the central nervous system}} of lower marine creatures earned him a doctorate and helped establish modern theories of neurology. After 1896 his main scientific interest switched to oceanography; {{in the course of his}} research he made many scientific cruises, mainly in the North Atlantic, and contributed to the development of modern oceanographic <b>equipment.</b> <b>As</b> one of his country's leading citizens, in 1905 Nansen spoke out for the ending of Norway's union with Sweden, and was instrumental in persuading Prince Carl of Denmark to accept the throne of the newly independent Norway. Between 1906 and 1908 he served as the Norwegian representative in London, where he helped negotiate the Integrity Treaty that guaranteed Norway's independent status.|$|E
