This allowed him to slip the manacle from his wrist while he sang his death chant. With a small hidden knife that was not found during two separate searches, he stabbed the driver (who survived), both falling out of the wagon, grabbed a soldier's unloaded carbine and was mortally wounded in his escape attempt.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{facilities}} are {{equipped to handle}} TBI better than others; initial measures include transporting patients to an appropriate treatment center. Both <b>during</b> <b>transport</b> and in hospital the primary concerns are ensuring proper oxygen supply, maintaining adequate {{blood flow to the}} brain, and controlling raised intracranial pressure (ICP), since high ICP deprives the brain of badly needed blood flow and can cause deadly brain herniation. Other methods to prevent damage include management of other injuries and prevention of seizures. Some data supports the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to improve outcomes.|$|E
5|$|In {{parts of}} the world which lack a high level of infrastructure, {{ambulances}} are designed to meet local conditions, being built using intermediate technology. Ambulances can also be trailers, which are pulled by bicycles, motorcycles, tractors, or animals. Animal-powered ambulances can be particularly useful in regions that are subject to flooding. Motorcycles fitted with sidecars (or motorcycle ambulances) are also used, though they are subject to some of the same limitations as more traditional over-the-road ambulances. The level of care provided by these ambulances varies between merely providing transport to a medical clinic to providing on-scene and continuing care <b>during</b> <b>transport.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dr. Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) {{is in the}} holosuite {{playing a}} secret agent program in the 1960s. Elim Garak (Andrew Robinson) intrudes and convinces Bashir to let him tag along. Meanwhile, Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks), Lt Cmdr. Worf (Michael Dorn), Lt. Cmdr. Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell), Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor), and Chief Petty Officer Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) are on a runabout, {{returning}} to Deep Space Nine. As they arrive they find that their vessel has been sabotaged and that a warp core breach is imminent. Lt. Cmdr. Michael Eddington beams them out, but the ship is destroyed <b>during</b> <b>transport</b> and Eddington is forced to store their patterns while he repairs the transporter, but doing so uses {{almost all of the}} station's memory, putting many station systems off-line.

5|$|The {{contract}} {{for construction of}} the pontoon bridge was awarded in August 1991 to a consortium, Arbeidsfellesskapet Salhus Bru, which consisted of Norwegian Contractors, Aker Entreprenør, Veidekke and Kværner Eureka. The components were built in Moss and Fredrikstad and then shipped to Lonevågen, a branch of Osterfjorden which was suitable to connect the parts. There were problems welding the high-strength low-alloy steel, {{which resulted in the}} work being halted for several days before an agreement was reached between the contractor and the Public Roads Administration. On 26 January 1994, the steel frame which would be used to fasten the pontoon bridge to the cable-stayed bridge, came adrift <b>during</b> <b>transport</b> in Skagerrak, and was severely damaged, causing a delay in the project. As the bridge had the longest laterally unsupported span in the world, the construction was watched by many international delegations.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{location of}} the La Cobata head was not a major archaeological site {{and it is likely}} that the head was either abandoned at its source or <b>during</b> <b>transport</b> to its intended destination. Various features of the head suggest that it was unfinished, such as a lack of symmetry below the mouth and an area of rough stone above the base. Rock was not removed from around the earspools as on other heads, and does not narrow towards the base. Large parts of the monument seem to be roughed out without finished detail. The right hand earspool also appears incomplete; the forward portion is marked with a sculpted line while the rear portion has been sculpted in relief, probably indicating that the right cheek and eye area were also unfinished. The La Cobata head was almost certainly carved from a raw boulder rather than being sculpted from a throne.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the energy relaxation of excitons <b>during</b> the real-space <b>transport</b> in ZnSe quantum wells by using microphotoluminescence with spatial resolution enhanced by a solid immersion lens.

By calculating the LO-phonon assisted recombination probability, we obtain the nonthermal energy distribution of excitons and observe directly the energy relaxation of hot excitons <b>during</b> their <b>transport.</b> We find the excitons remain hot <b>during</b> their <b>transport</b> on a length scale of several micrometers.

40|$|The {{presented}} work {{focuses on}} the experimental investigation of atmospheric aerosols of various origins. Main objectives are the characterisation of aerosols {{and their impact on}} climate. The first key topic is the effect of ageing and dilution of forest fire aerosol layers <b>during</b> long-range <b>transport</b> from the U. S. to Europe and the transformation of anthropogenic aerosols from urban pollution <b>during</b> atmospheric <b>transport.</b> For that purpose, observations from airborne measurements onboard the Falcon research-aircraft during the ITOP (Intercontinental Transport of Ozone and Precursors) field experiment in July 2004 are being analysed. The second key topic is the investigation of microphysical, optical and radiative properties of desert dust aerosols over source regions, as well as the modification of these dust properties <b>during</b> atmospheric <b>transport</b> from the source region to the far field and mixing with biomass burning aerosols. Information on these properties of aerosols are very important for satellite validation purposes (ENVISAT, ESSP 3 /CALIPSO), for meso- and global-scale models and essential for the assessment of the impact of desert dust on climate. The information on the effects of transformation and mixing processes <b>during</b> long-range <b>transport</b> is urgently needed for an assessment of the impact of desert dust on the composition of the tropospheric aerosol and on heterogeneous chemical processes. To this aim, airborne in-situ measurements of desert dust aerosols in the vertical column over a source region and <b>during</b> long-range <b>transport</b> will be carried out during the German SAMUM (SAharan Mineral dUst experiMent) project...|$|R
