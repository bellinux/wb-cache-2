5|$|In {{the third}} session on Saturday morning, Hamilton topped the {{timesheets}} once again, setting {{a time of}} 1:44.352, {{a quarter of a}} second clear of teammate Rosberg. Hülkenberg was third for Force India ahead of Ricciardo and Vettel. The session saw several incidents: Bottas damaged the floor of his car when he ran over a <b>drain</b> <b>cover</b> on his installation lap and was forced to miss the rest of the session; Felipe Massa made contact with the wall, but was later able to rejoin practice; Räikkönen's track time was limited as well due to a loss of power; and a red flag period occurred right after the chequered flag fell as Pérez crashed at turn 15.|$|E
5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2016 season, two ninety-minute practice and one sixty-minute session were held before qualifying on Saturday. The first two usually {{take place on}} Friday, with Monaco being the single exemption, where those sessions are held on Thursday, in order to minimise road-closure disruptions to local residents. In the first session on Thursday morning, Lewis Hamilton topped the timesheets {{with a time of}} 1:15.537, one tenth of a second faster than his teammate Nico Rosberg. They were followed by Sebastian Vettel, almost half a second down on Hamilton, and the two Red Bull cars of Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen respectively. Daniil Kvyat, driving for Toro Rosso, in sixth was the last driver to get within a second of Hamilton's time. He {{was the only one of}} the front runners to set his time on the supersoft instead of the faster ultrasoft tyres. There were several incidents during the session: After twenty-four minutes, Felipe Massa hit the barrier in turn one, damaging his car and leading to a virtual safety car (VSC) period. Later, Lewis Hamilton had a brake lockup at the same spot, but was able to get into the run-off area without touching the guardrail. Several other drivers had dangerous moments in turn one as well, but the most severe incident of the session came three minutes to the end: A <b>drain</b> <b>cover</b> had come loose around the first corner, puncturing Rosberg's left rear tyre and damaging Jenson Button's McLaren MP4-31, causing the practice to be red flagged, ultimately ending the session.|$|E
25|$|In Monaco, he {{qualified}} {{ninth and}} {{moved up to}} sixth position through the first corner. Later, he had a suspension failure caused by a loose <b>drain</b> <b>cover</b> and crashed heavily. After crashing he threw the car's steering wheel out, as {{he was sitting in}} the middle of a 120mph corner with his car on fire. This was then run over by Karun Chandhok's Hispania.|$|E

25|$|In 1993, Edwards {{began his}} own firm in Raleigh (now named Kirby & Holt) with a friend, David Kirby. He {{became known as}} the top plaintiffs' {{attorney}} in North Carolina. The biggest case of his legal career was a 1996 product liability lawsuit against Sta-Rite, the manufacturer of a defective pool <b>drain</b> <b>cover.</b> The case involved Valerie Lakey, a three-year-old girl who was disemboweled by the suction power of the pool drain pump when she sat on an open pool drain whose protective cover had been removed by other children at the pool, after the swim club had failed to install the cover properly. Despite 12 prior suits with similar claims, Sta-Rite continued to make and sell drain covers lacking warnings. Sta-Rite protested that an additional warning would have made no difference because the pool owners already knew the importance of keeping the cover secured.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} stages of the season it was clear that Montoya and his car were finally adapted to one another. The Colombian has often {{attributed}} this to the greater effort made by the McLaren team than by Williams to tune the car to his driving style. In the last 7 grands prix Montoya finished, he scored 3 wins, 2 poles and 5 podiums, as well as setting a track record(fastest lap) of 1:24.770, which stands today still, at the 2005 Turkish Grand Prix. At the Brazilian GP, Montoya led home McLaren's first 1–2 result in years, ahead of newly crowned world champion Fernando Alonso in third. It was his last finish of the year. In Japan he was forced off the track by Jacques Villeneuve on lap one, while in China a loose <b>drain</b> <b>cover</b> rose up and hit his car, damaging the engine. Overall, he finished the season in 4th position in the Drivers' Championship.|$|E

Conan begins decoding the riddles in order: [...] "A rolling bell rises me" [...] refers to Big Ben; [...] "My portion is like a chilled boiled egg like a corpse," [...] leads them to City Hall where dolls engraved with Mazarin Stone are found. Referring to The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone, the group beheads the doll where they discover the letter T; [...] "I finished up with a whole pickle," [...] leads them to 30 St Mary Axe where they find scratched up pens labeled as Dancing Men. As in The Adventure of the Dancing Men, matching {{the top and bottom}} caps to reveal the letter N; [...] "It rings again for my hatred" [...] leads them to cross the Westminster Bridge towards Big Ben. On the bridge, they find a drain engraved with Valley of Fear. Referring to The Valley of Fear, they find a <b>drain</b> <b>cover</b> with the letter A in the river; [...] "Now I remember to ask a cake to celebrate in advance" [...] leads them to St Bride's Church where they find envelopes entitled A Scandal in Bohemia. Soaking the envelope in water reveals the letter S; [...] "I'm a long nosed wizard in a castle" [...] leads them to Elephant & Castle tube station where they find a man carrying a suitcase with the word identity on it. Referring to A Case of Identity, they find the letter U {{on the inside of the}} man's pants; [...] "It tells me to finish everything piercing a white back with two swords" [...] refers to the logo of a local porcelain store which displays an ornament with strings and bells attached on the end. Referring to A Study in Scarlet, they locate a red string with the letter R. Rearranging the letters results in Saturn, a reference to Saturday. Connecting the riddle's locations on a map forms a tennis racquet referencing the Wimbledon championships.|$|E

Opening a <b>drain</b> <b>cover</b> {{at the side of the}} house, Cattran discovered the drain was packed with a flesh-like substance and numerous small bones of unknown origin. Cattran reported his suspicions to his supervisor, Gary Wheeler. However, as he had arrived at the property at dusk, Cattran and his supervisor agreed to postpone further investigation into the blockage until the following morning. Prior to leaving the property, Nilsen and a fellow tenant named Jim Allcock convened with Cattran to discuss the source of the substance. Upon hearing Cattran exclaim how similar the substance was in appearance to human flesh, Nilsen replied: [...] "It looks to me like someone has been flushing down their Kentucky Fried Chicken." ...|$|E

25|$|These toilets {{were only}} {{used by the}} {{affluent}} classes; most people would have squatted over old pots set into the ground or used open pits.

This design could be seen on maps of the Towers imprinted on the cast-iron <b>drain</b> <b>covers</b> within the estate. The walkways all led to a ¼ mile-long elevated walkway leading straight through the mostly covered Killingworth Citadel Shopping Centre.

50|$|It {{was built}} {{as part of}} the western side of the Antonine Wall around 142 AD. A {{comparable}} eastern site would be Inveresk Roman Fort. The fort's defenses consisted of a turf and clay rampart 23+1/2 ft thick, supported on thick sandstone foundation slabs, part of which was preserved to a height of around 5 ft. A 33 ft wide berm separated the fort wall and the first of two ditches, each measuring about 15 ft wide and 4 ft deep, and spaced 7 ft apart. It was built in a rhomboid pattern and was large enough to house both troops and cavalry.

50|$|The {{traditional}} use of {{kosher salt}} is for removing surface blood from meat by desiccation, {{as part of}} the koshering process for meat. The meat is soaked in cool water, <b>drained,</b> <b>covered</b> with a thin layer of salt, then allowed to stand on a rack or board for an hour. The salt remains {{on the surface of the}} meat, for the most part undissolved, and absorbs fluids from the meat. The salt grains are then washed off and discarded, carrying away the fluids absorbed. Compare this process to full desiccation of meat, which yields salt-cured meat.|$|R
