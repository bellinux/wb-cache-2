5|$|Capillaries are {{organized}} into capillary beds in tissues; {{it is here}} that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues. Once the blood has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart. Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand <b>extreme</b> <b>pressure.</b> As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart. Once the blood reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium, then the right ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen. Oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the body.|$|E

40|$|At {{pressures}} above a megabar (100 GPa), sodium crystallizes in {{a number}} of complex crystal structures with unusually low melting temperatures, reaching as low as 300 K at 118 GPa. We have utilized this unique behavior at <b>extreme</b> <b>pressures</b> to grow a single crystal of sodium at 108 GPa, and have investigated the complex crystal structure at this pressure using high-intensity x-rays from the new Diamond synchrotron source, in combination with a pressure cell with wide angular apertures. We confirm that, at 108 GPa, sodium is isostructural with the cI 16 phase of lithium, and we have refined the full crystal structure of this phase. The results demonstrate the extension of single-crystal structure refinement beyond 100 GPa and raise the prospect of successfully determining the structures of yet more complex phases reported in sodium and other elements at <b>extreme</b> <b>pressures...</b>|$|R

25|$|In 1559, {{five years}} before Shakespeare's birth, the Elizabethan Religious Settlement finally severed the Church of England from the Roman Catholic Church. In the ensuing years, <b>extreme</b> <b>pressure</b> was placed on England's Catholics to accept the {{practices}} of the Church of England, and recusancy laws made illegal any service {{not found in the}} Book of Common Prayer including the Roman Catholic Mass. In Shakespeare's lifetime there was a substantial and widespread quiet resistance to the newly imposed reforms. Some scholars, using both historical and literary evidence, have argued that Shakespeare was one of these recusants.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} extension was {{a connection between}} Afula and Jerusalem. The first 17km section was completed {{at the beginning of}} 1913 and connected Afula with Jenin. Meissner's full plan never bore fruit however, because of the French government's <b>extreme</b> <b>pressure</b> on the Ottoman government to cancel the project, which would compete with the French-owned Jaffa–Jerusalem railway. In the end, only 40km were built from Afula, and terminated near the village Silat ad-Dhahr (Sileh). This extension was later used by Meissner during World War I to continue the railway to Tulkarm and from there via the Eastern Railway to Lydda, where it connected with the Jaffa–Jerusalem railway and railways to the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt.|$|E

25|$|Railway {{operations}} are vulnerable during high winds {{and there have}} been several de-wirements over the years due to the unusually wide spacing (up to 75 m) between the supporting masts of the overhead lines. The other cost-reduction measure was the use of headspan catenary support systems over the quadruple track sections – as employed in the Weaver Junction to Glasgow Electrification on the WCML during the 1970s. Headspans do not have mechanically independent registration (MIR) of each electrified road and thus are more complex to set up, compared to TTC (two-track cantilever) and portal style support structures, during installation. In the event of a de-wirement of a given road, headspans result in the need to correctly set up the OLE of adjacent roads before the line can reopen to electric traction. This was a result of <b>extreme</b> <b>pressure</b> from the Department for Transport to reduce avoidable costs when the line was originally electrified between 1985 and 1990.|$|E
500|$|The {{source of}} this myth is from the {{appearance}} of some destroyed structures after violent tornadoes. When one wall receives the <b>extreme</b> <b>pressure</b> of tornado winds, it will likely collapse [...] This then leads to a considerable [...] pressure on the three remaining walls, which fall outwards as the roof falls down, creating {{the impression of a}} house which has exploded. Indeed, damage surveys of [...] "exploded" [...] houses usually show at least one wall which has blown inward. Additionally, if the roof is lifted before any walls fall, the walls can fall in any direction. If they fall outward, this structure can also appear to have exploded.|$|E
500|$|Construction of {{the first}} two airframes, {{designated}} as the I-211 (I-21 version 1), began at the end of 1946, under <b>extreme</b> <b>pressure</b> by the Ministry of Aircraft Production to complete initial flight testing by 1 August 1947, to enable the aircraft {{to take part in the}} Aviation Day Flypast at Tushino on 18 August. While one of the two airframes initially produced was used for static testing, the other was fitted with [...] Lyul'ka TR-1 turbojet engines because the intended TR-2 was not available. The engines were mounted in the middle of the wing, with the wing spars continued by banjo rings around the engines, much like those on the British Gloster Meteor fighter. Despite pressure from above, the I-211 was unable to participate in the Tushino display.|$|E
