30|$|It {{was assumed}} that the reactor is {{operated}} with 20 -bar steam, corresponding to a reactor temperature of 190 °C, and is modeled as a continuous reactor with 10 % higher steam consumption than an adiabatic unit to account for heat losses. Pretreated material {{is assumed to be}} cooled by flashing at 4 and 1 bar. The <b>flashed</b> <b>steam</b> contains volatile compounds and, after condensation and cooling to 45 °C, is fed to the WWT unit. Part of the <b>flashed</b> <b>steam</b> at 4 and 1 bar is not condensed, but instead recirculated and mixed with the incoming wheat straw to preheat the straw to 96 °C. After flashing, the pretreated material (slurry) is cooled from 100 °C to 55 °C before mixing with fresh water prior to SSF.|$|R
40|$|Vigorous {{hydrothermal}} activity interspersed by sequences of phreatic and phreatomagmatic eruptions occur at Whakaari (White Island volcano), New Zealand. Here, we investigate {{the influence of}} sample type (hydrothermally altered cemented ash tuffs and unconsolidated ash/lapilli) and fragmentation mechanism (<b>steam</b> <b>flashing</b> versus gas expansion) on fragmentation and ejection velocities {{as well as on}} particle-size and shape. Our rapid decompression experiments show that fragmentation and ejection speeds of two ash tuffs, cemented by alunite and amorphous opal, increase with increasing porosity and that both are significantly enhanced in the presence of <b>steam</b> <b>flashing.</b> Ejection speeds of unconsolidated samples are higher than ejection speeds of cemented tuffs, as less energy is consumed by fragmentation. Fragmentation dominated by <b>steam</b> <b>flashing</b> results in increased fragmentation energy and a higher proportion of fine particles. Particle shape analyses before and after fragmentation reveal that both <b>steam</b> <b>flashing</b> and pure gas expansion produce platy or bladed particles from fracturing parallel to the decompression front. Neither fragmentation mechanisms nor sample type show a significant influence on the shape. Our results emphasize that, under identical pressure and temperature conditions, eruptions accompanied by the process of liquid water <b>flashing</b> to <b>steam</b> are significantly more violent than those driven simply by gas expansion. Therefore, phase changes during decompression and cementation are both important considerations for hazard assessment and modeling of eruptions in hydrothermally active environments...|$|R

50|$|When {{cold water}} hits a heat {{exchange}} coil at , <b>flash</b> <b>steam</b> is generated, along with mechanical shocks {{to the system}} and considerable scaling inside the coil {{to the extent that}} the water contains dissolved solids. Disposal of the steam and the hot water may prove to be difficult, and the service life of the cooling system may be short. This can be alleviated to some extent by first precooling the coil with a flow of compressed air followed by a mist of water and compressed air. This is only marginally better than cold water by itself, and it does little to eliminate <b>flash</b> <b>steam.</b>|$|E
50|$|Geothermal {{electricity}} is electricity generated from geothermal energy.

Geothermal electricity generation is used in 24 countries while geothermal heating is in use in 70 countries.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flash</b> <b>steam</b> {{stations}} pull deep, high-pressure {{hot water}} into lower-pressure tanks {{and use the}} resulting flashed steam to drive turbines. They require fluid temperatures of at least 180 °C, usually more. This {{is the most common}} type of station in operation today. <b>Flash</b> <b>Steam</b> plants use geothermal reservoirs of water with temperatures greater than 360 °F (182 °C). The hot water flows up through wells in the ground under its own pressure. As it flows upward, the pressure decreases and some of the hot water boils into steam. The steam is then separated from the water and used to power a turbine/generator. Any leftover water and condensed steam may be injected back into the reservoir, making this a potentially sustainable resource. At The Geysers in California, twenty years of power production had depleted the groundwater and operations were substantially reduced. To restore some of the former capacity, water injection was developed.|$|E

5000|$|A binary {{cycle power}} plant {{is a type}} of {{geothermal}} power plant that allows cooler geothermal reservoirs to be used than is necessary for dry steam and <b>flash</b> <b>steam</b> plants. As of 2010, <b>flash</b> <b>steam</b> plants are {{the most common type of}} geothermal power generation plants in operation today, which use water at temperatures greater than 182 C that is pumped under high pressure to the generation equipment at the surface. With binary cycle geothermal power plants, pumps are used to pump hot water from a geothermal well, through a heat exchanger, and the cooled water is returned to the underground reservoir. A second [...] "working" [...] or [...] "binary" [...] fluid with a low boiling point, typically a butane or pentane hydrocarbon, is pumped at fairly high pressure (...) through the heat exchanger, where it is vaporized and then directed through a turbine. The vapor exiting the turbine is then condensed by cold air radiators or cold water and cycled back through the heat exchanger.|$|E

In some mines, Nickel and Cobalt are treated with CCD, after the original ore was treated with concentrated Sulfuric acid and steam in Titanium covered autoclaves, producing nickel cobalt slurry. The nickel and cobalt in the slurry are removed from it almost completely using a CCD system exchanging the cobalt and nickel with <b>flash</b> <b>steam</b> heated water.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} by Serpollet of the <b>flash</b> <b>steam</b> boiler {{brought about the}} appearance of various diminutive steam tricycles and quadricycles during the late 80s and early 90s, notably by de Dion and Bouton; these successfully competed in long distance races but soon met with stiff competition for public favour from {{the internal combustion engine}} cars being developed, notably by Peugeot, that quickly cornered most of the popular market. In the face of the flood of IC cars, proponents of the steam car had to fight a long rear-guard battle that was to last into modern times.|$|E
3000|$|... results {{indicating}} that the fractured rocks within Mqs 3 were perhaps dominated by water vapor, we surmise that the activation of Mqs 3 was associated with phenomena induced by the phase transition (e.g., <b>flashed</b> <b>steam</b> from the injection point, a change in water volume). However, a causal relationship between the activation and the phase transition is unclear because {{the time of the}} phase transition at the location of Mqs 3 is not available (the temporal history is available only for the bottom of the Test Well). Another problem is that the available observations (pressure and temperature) are not at the location of Mqs 3 but {{at the bottom of the}} Test Well, and we currently do not have other evidence for the hypothesis.|$|R

25|$|This {{temporarily}} superheated water undergoes volume boiling {{as opposed}} to pool boiling in conventional boilers where the heating surface is in contact.

50|$|A steam {{generator}} {{is a form}} of low water-content boiler, similar to a <b>flash</b> <b>steam</b> boiler. The usual construction is as a spiral coil of water-tube, arranged as a single, or monotube, coil. Circulation is once-through and pumped under pressure, as a forced-circulation boiler. The narrow-tube construction, without any large-diameter drums or tanks, means that they are safe from the effects of explosion, even if worked at high pressures. The pump flowrate is adjustable, according to the quantity of steam required at that time. The burner output is throttled to maintain a constant working temperature. The burner output required varies according to the quantity of water being evaporated: this can be either adjusted by open-loop control according to the pump throughput, or by a closed-loop control to maintain the measured temperature.|$|E
50|$|The {{effect was}} also {{described}} by the eminent Victorian steam boiler designer, Sir William Fairbairn, in reference to its effect on massively reducing heat transfer from a hot iron surface to water, such as within a boiler. In a pair of lectures on boiler design, he cited the work of Pierre Hippolyte Boutigny (1798-1884) and Professor Bowman of King's College, London in studying this. A drop of water that was vaporized almost immediately at 168 C persisted for 152 seconds at 202 C. Lower temperatures in a boiler firebox might evaporate water more quickly as a result; compare Mpemba effect. An alternative approach was to increase the temperature beyond the Leidenfrost point. Fairbairn considered this too, {{and may have been}} contemplating the <b>flash</b> <b>steam</b> boiler, but considered the technical aspects insurmountable for the time.|$|E
50|$|Geothermal {{energy is}} derived from the heat found beneath the earth’s surface. In nations with {{temperate}} climates, geothermal energy is used directly, to provide heating for homes. In the Philippines, geothermal energy is used to generate electricity. Two types of technologies are used in the Philippines. These are firstly, the higher temperature <b>flash</b> <b>steam</b> method and secondly, the lower temperature binary cycle method. In the Philippines, the first is the more common. The second is used only at the MAKBAN plant. Geothermal plants are suitable for areas with low winds, such as Mindanao, and areas that have rainy weather, such as Batanes. Geothermal energy production can result in the release of toxic substances such as mercury, hydrogen sulfide, arsenic and selenium. In 2014, at a geothermal plant in Biliran, eight plant workers were hospitalized with hydrogen sulphide poisoning.|$|E
40|$|During the {{generation}} of steam, most water impurities are not evaporated with the steam and thus concentrate in the boiler water. The concentration of the impurities is usually regulated by the adjustment of the continuous blowdown valve, which controls {{the amount of water}} (and concentrated impurities) purged from the steam drum. Since a certain amount of continuous blowdown must be maintained for satisfactory boiler performance, a significant quantity of heat is removed from the boiler. It is necessary to provide a simple-to-use method to calculate the total amount of heat that is recoverable using this system. In the present work, a simple-to-use predictive tool, which is easier than existing approaches, less complicated with fewer computations and minimize the complex and time-consuming calculation steps, is formulated to arrive at an appropriate estimation of the percent of blowdown that is <b>flashed</b> to <b>steam</b> as a function of flash drum pressure and operating boiler drum pressure followed by the calculation of the amount of heat recoverable from the condensate. Since all of the heat in the <b>flashed</b> <b>steam</b> is recoverable, the total percent of heat recoverable from the flash tank and heat-exchanger system is calculated in the final step. Results show that the proposed predictive tool has a very good agreement with the reported data wherein the average absolute deviation percent was observed to be around 1. 47 %...|$|R
5000|$|This type of flash {{evaporation}} {{is used in}} the desalination of brackish water or ocean water by [...] "Multi-Stage Flash Distillation." [...] The water is heated and then routed into a reduced-pressure {{flash evaporation}} [...] "stage" [...] where some of the water <b>flashes</b> into <b>steam.</b> This steam is subsequently condensed into salt-free water. The residual salty liquid from that first stage is introduced into a second flash evaporation stage at a pressure lower than the first stage pressure. More water is <b>flashed</b> into <b>steam</b> which is also subsequently condensed into more salt-free water. This sequential use of multiple flash evaporation stages is continued until the design objectives of the system are met. A large part of the world's installed desalination capacity uses multi-stage flash distillation. Typically such plants have 24 or more sequential stages of flash evaporation.|$|R

50|$|Power {{boats are}} {{typically}} Fast electric or internal combustion, (ignition engine or glow plug R/C engine based) {{and some are}} steam powered (conventional type, and also <b>flash</b> <b>steam).</b> (At one time some boats used engines working on the compression ignition principle. These were not diesels in the true {{sense of the word}} but the modelling fraternity frequently referred to them as such. A few enthusiasts still operate such engines.) The power is commonly used to rotate a submerged propeller, aircraft propeller or jet which in turn provide the thrust to move the craft. Typically power boats have two controls, rudder, outboard motor or stern drive and throttle control. Powered scale boats will often have additional remote-controlled functions to improve realism, e.g. sounding fog horns, rotating radar antennae etc. Some of the more sophisticated powered racing boats may also have additional remote-controlled functions. These may include remote mixture control allowing the driver to optimise the fuel/air mixture during a race. Another function occasionally implemented for racing boats using a surface piercing propellor is remote control of depth or angle of thrust. There are three main types of power boat. RTR(ready-to-run), ARTR(almost-ready-to-run), and kit versions are available. All thoroughbred racing boats are made from kits and the builders add their own gear and radio.|$|E

40|$|An open Rankine-cycle {{heat pump}} is ideally suited for {{producing}} low-pressure industrial process steam. Because steam serves {{as both the}} heat pump motive fluid and process fluid, the system achieves a unique simplicity and versatility. No intermediate refrigerant fluid exists for which to construct a process interface or impose a temperature limit. Interface components such as the heat pump condenser are not required. Moreover, the use of water vapor eliminates toxicity and flammability risks inherent with most closed-cycle heat pump fluids. The control strategy is simple. Low-pressure (subatmospheric) water vapor, generated by <b>flashing</b> <b>steam</b> at a temperature below that of the waste stream, is compressed to the process pressure and temperature by an electric-motor-driven, multistage compressor train.

5000|$|Surface {{blowdown}} continuously bleeds off a low {{volume of}} water from within the boiler {{as a means of}} ridding the boiler of dissolved impurities. It is most effective to remove water with the highest level of impurities; and such water is found where steam separates in the steam drum {{at the top of the}} boiler. There are two types of surface blowdown fittings. The simpler is a pipe entering the steam drum at the normal water level. A more sophisticated skimmer arrangement attaches a swivel joint to the pipe for a short length of pipe suspended by a float. [...] The skimmer may be more effective at removing floating oil which might otherwise cause foaming. Surface blowdown is normally fed to a flash tank and heat exchanger for heat recovery. The <b>flashed</b> <b>steam</b> can be used in the feedwater heater. These energy economies are seldom practical with infrequent bottom blowdown. Surface blowdown offers the additional advantage of steady-state operating conditions.|$|R

The single flash cycle contains only one throttling valve (expansion valve) through which the geothermal fluid is expanded, and one separator to separate the vapor from the liquid after the expansion process in the expansion valve. This separation occurs at constant pressure and temperature. The vapor generated is sent to a steam turbine to produce electricity while the liquid is re-injected back to the ground. The geothermal fluid in the well is above 182  °C for the <b>flash</b> <b>steam</b> power plants. <b>Flash</b> <b>steam</b> power plants use a condenser to condense the steam leaving the turbine and then re-inject it into the ground.|$|E
