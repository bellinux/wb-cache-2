40|$|Policy {{debates on}} trade and the {{environment}} frequently refer to a need for countries linked by trade to co-ordinate, or even harmonise, their purely domestic environmental policies. Underlying this argument is a concern that national governments will not fully <b>internalise</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>externalities.</b> Conventional trade models suggest this concern is unwarranted and harmonisation may be damaging. In this paper I consider two possible bases for this concern - strategic trade and political economy considerations - and assess the implications {{for the design of}} policy and political institutions to achieve co-ordination. A model which links these two factors suggests a possible rationale for harmonisation of environmental policies, even when countries differ significantly with respect to environmental damage costs...|$|E
40|$|Industry {{has been}} {{upgrading}} its production processes through eco-innovation combining {{environmental and economic}} benefits, thus reducing some resource burdens which otherwise lie outside economic accounting. Some companies have shown interest in evaluating investment options for resource burdens and total value-added across a whole-system value chain. Our EC research project developed a method for whole-system assessment of eco-innovation with multi-stakeholder cooperation. In three cases presented here, tensions arise among various aims, resource burdens, system levels, beneficiaries and timescales, thus complicating the concept of eco-innovation as a win-win strategy. Radical eco-innovation would depend on extra functions, value-chain actors and resource usages which can provide greater overall benefits. But such investment faces many systemic obstacles. Eco-innovation remains path-dependent, thus limiting the scope to <b>internalise</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>externalities.</b> The tensions and difficulties cast doubt on an EC strategy emphasising uptake of eco-innovative technologies as the means to decouple economic growth from resource burdens...|$|E

It first explores {{the implications of}} the global economic downturn of 2008 - 09 for environmental policies, focusing in particular on the example of action against climate change. The arguments for and against activist fiscal policies in general are then reviewed, and the case made that a demand-induced downturn provides a very good opportunity to undertake a necessary step change in the public spending component of environmental policies and to start working through a backlog of public investment to improve the environment. Fiscal policy should be used to improve the allocation of resources across time and space. Recent fiscal stimuli are considered in the light of this discussion. It is also argued that there is little cause to delay the introduction of price signals to <b>internalise</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>externalities.</b> But the levels at which such signals should be set requires careful analysis; changes over the business cycle may be warranted, depending {{on the nature of the}} environmental externality and the cause(s) of the business cycle in question...|$|E

40|$|This paper studies {{under what}} {{conditions}} a ‘double dividend’ may occur {{in the sense that}} both environmental quality and employment rise. A simple static general equilibrium model is employed in which tax policy faces the dual task of <b>internalising</b> a negative <b>environmental</b> <b>externality</b> and raising revenue to finance public consumption. The model features a clearing labour market with both labour demand and supply and a fixed factor of production (e. g. capital). Hence, we can study tax incidence and its effect on employment, environmental quality, and the marginal cost of public funds. It is shown for the case of an upward sloping labour supply curve and less than full tax shifting by employers that a shift towards greener preferences cannot yield a double dividend, even if the fixed factor is important. However, if labour supply curve bends backwards, more environmental concern confers a double dividend.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{deliverable}} D 6. 2 {{is to support}} with a quantitative economic assessment the evaluation {{of a set of}} policies scrutinized within the DYNAMIX project, aiming to promote decoupling of resources use from GDP and material efficiency within the EU. The analytical tools used for the investigation are three macro - economic models, ICES, MEMO and MEWA, all belonging to the category of Computable General Equilibrium modelling, but with complementary characteristics. More specifically: they all provide a sectoral representation of the EU economic system and endogenous price formation. In practice, they can assess direct and indirect policy effects on the whole economic system and the full macroeconomic feedbacks, beyond the sector initially subjected to the policy intervention. However, ICES representing the EU with a country detail, is better suited to capture intra and extra EU trade effects. MEWA and MEMO consi der the EU as a single region, but differently from ICES, offer a more realistic representation of technological change, feature forward looking agents and have a richer representation of labour supply choices. The policies examined by the different models and their slightly different implementation, due to the differences in the models’ sectoral and functional details, are summarized in the table below. [Table 1 DYNAMIX Quantitative Economic Assessment Policy Matrix. ] The first two policies examined - a material tax and a tax aimed at <b>internalising</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>externalities</b> - are based on different designs and implementation strategies. Nonetheless, their common trait is the breadth. They have direct and indirect effects on many sectors, and thus have impacts clearly detectable on the overall EU GDP. The strongest message from the analysis is that the cost of the policy crucially depends upon (a) the sensitivity of the production system to the dynamic incentive to dematerialize induced by the policy signal, i. e. ultimately upon the reaction (or availability) of technological progress and (b) the use of tax revenues, i. e. on the implementation of an appropriate revenue - recycling scheme. A combination of technological progress in response to the tax with a reduction in labour taxation can indeed, according to the modelled outcomes, end up stimulating economic growth (a maximum 8...|$|R
40|$|Policy {{debates on}} trade and the {{environment}} frequently refer to a need for countries linked by trade to co-ordinate their environmental policies even for entirely local pollution problems; co-ordination is often taken to imply harmonisation of environmental policies to provide a 'level playing field' for trade. Underlying this argument is a concern that national governments will not fully <b>internalise</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>externalities.</b> In the conventional small open-economy model with a welfare-maximising government such a concern is unfounded; moreover even if governments did not fully internalise externalities, policy reforms {{would not have to}} be co-ordinated and harmonisation would be undesirable if there are genuine differences between countries. To give some basis for international environmental policy, it is necessary to depart from the conventional small open-economy model and I consider a number of such departures, together with their implications for policy and institutions. I work within a framework where any co-ordination is achieved by a supra-national government agency, e. g. {{in the form of a}} federal government. I begin with a simple second-best argument where countries are large, national governments have not fully corrected environmental market failures, but they do not seek to manipulate terms of trade. This provides a justification for co-ordination of policy reforms, and in a special model this can be considered a form of harmonisation. However to consider appropriate institutions to achieve co-ordination one needs to consider why national governments have not fully corrected market failures. The first case I consider is a strategic trade model, where individual national governments may have incentives to set weak environmental policies (a 'race to the bottom'). While this provides a rationale for co-ordination of the domestic environmental policies of states, this is unlikely to require harmonisation, and a policy of minimum standards may also fail. If the federal government is poorly informed about environmental damage costs in individual states, this may require setting environmental policies in states with different damage costs which are more similar than would be the case with full information, but this does not amount to harmonisation of environmental policies. I next examine political economy models of how governments may set their environmental and trade policies when governments have objective functions which reflect the influence of special interest groups. This leads to an analysis of political institutions for limiting the discretion of governments subject to the influence of special interests, while recognising that governments have access to information not available to voters. In the context of the particular model employed, the relevant restriction of government discretion implies harmonisation of environmental policies, and I assess the incentives for restricting government discretion at both the federal and state level...|$|E

In the opposite case, in which information is asymmetric, i. e., the small country's Government cannot observe the positive enviromental effects of its firm's exports to foreign consumers, we find that: (i) the Pareto optimum is always enforced, since the brown country always relaxes the distortionary trade policy, and (ii) cheating on the <b>environmental</b> <b>externality</b> allows the brown country's government to extract extra surplus from the green country.

By valuing the <b>environmental</b> <b>externalities</b> of agriculture, this article aims to heighten awareness of the environmental roles of agriculture to stimulate its implication in agricultural policy-making. The study presents estimates of economic values of <b>environmental</b> <b>externalities</b> from rice-wheat farming system in Zhenjiang, in aspects of greenhouse gas emissions, non-point source pollution, carbon sequestration and water containing capacity. We provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, with each step including measurement of physical dimensions and monetary evaluation. The former is based on a large-scale literature review, which provided a vital foundation for the monetary valuation. The results reveal that the values of greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural land, agricultural non-point source pollution, carbon sequestration by crop and soil, and the flood control function provided by agricultural land are estimated as: -Â US$ 3. 61 Â xÂ  107 Â a-Â  1, -Â US$ 4. 59 Â xÂ  106 Â a-Â  1, +Â US$ 2. 30 Â xÂ  109 Â a-Â  1 and +Â US$ 2. 21 Â xÂ  107 Â a-Â  1, respectively.

40|$|Because of the {{long-term}} nature of the climate problem, technological advances are often seen as {{an important component of}} any solution. However, when considering the potential for technology to help solve the climate problem, two market failures exist which lead to underinvestment in climate-friendly R&D: <b>environmental</b> <b>externalities</b> and the public goods nature of new knowledge. As a result, government subsidies to climate-friendly R&D projects are often proposed as part of a policy solution. Using the ENTICE model, I analyze the effectiveness of such subsidies, both with and without other climate policies, such as a carbon tax. While R&D subsidies do lead to significant increases in climate-friendly R&D, this R&D has little impact on the climate itself. Subsidies address the problem of knowledge as a public good, but they do not address the <b>environmental</b> <b>externality,</b> and thus offer no additional incentive to adopt new technologies. Moreover, high opportunity costs to R&D limit the potential role that subsidies can play. While R&D subsidies can improve efficiency, policies that directly affect the <b>environmental</b> <b>externality</b> have a much larger impact on both atmospheric temperature and economic welfare. ...|$|R
