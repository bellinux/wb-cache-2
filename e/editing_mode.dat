25|$|There {{are several}} modes of play within ChuChu Rocket! {{including}} a single-player puzzle mode, a puzzle <b>editing</b> <b>mode,</b> a cooperative challenge mode, and competitive multiplayer modes. In the puzzle mode, the player is provided a limited set of arrows to {{place on the}} field to save all the ChuChus in play. The puzzle <b>editing</b> <b>mode</b> allows players {{to create their own}} puzzles like this. In the challenge mode, players are given 30 seconds to save the ChuChus in play without any arrow limitations as in puzzle mode. In the competition modes, each player has a rocket and must guide as many ChuChus as possible into their rocket in the time limit. This mode supports up to four players, either in free-for-all or team-based fashion.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} and more distinctive features of Serious Editor 2's level editor is that it allows for real-time editing. The level design process for most games often requires the level to be modified in the editor, compiled, saved, and then loaded separately in the game where it can be tested. However, Serious Editor 2 allows for levels to be played and tested within the editor without requiring compilation. While playing the level within the editor, the level designer can directly switch to <b>editing</b> <b>mode,</b> make the desired modifications, and then continue playing, greatly simplifying the final stages of level editing.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} MacPaint did {{incorporate a}} double zoom function with only head on. Instead of a zoom function, a special magnification mode called FatBits was used. FatBits showed each pixel as a clickable rectangle {{with a white}} border. The FatBits <b>editing</b> <b>mode</b> {{set the standard for}} many future editors. MacPaint included a [...] "Goodies" [...] menu which included the FatBits tool. This menu was named the [...] "Aids" [...] menu in prerelease versions, but was renamed [...] "Goodies" [...] as public awareness of the AIDS epidemic grew in the summer of 1983.|$|E
50|$|Elebits {{utilizes}} Wii's online service, WiiConnect24. In single {{player and}} <b>Edit</b> <b>Mode,</b> players can take screenshots {{and send them}} to other Wii consoles. Players can also send levels that they created in <b>Edit</b> <b>Mode.</b>|$|R
50|$|Editing modes: The {{two primary}} modes of work are Object <b>Mode</b> and <b>Edit</b> <b>Mode,</b> which are toggled with the Tab key. Object mode {{is used to}} {{manipulate}} individual objects as a unit, while <b>Edit</b> <b>mode</b> is used to manipulate the actual object data. For example, Object Mode {{can be used to}} move, scale, and rotate entire polygon meshes, and <b>Edit</b> <b>Mode</b> can be used to manipulate the individual vertices of a single mesh. There are also several other modes, such as Vertex Paint, Weight Paint, and Sculpt Mode.|$|R

5000|$|One of {{the modes}} in Elebits is [...] "Edit Mode". In <b>Edit</b> <b>Mode,</b> players can {{create their own}} stages by placing {{different}} kinds of objects and Elebits throughout any of the 29 stages in the game. Levels are only available in <b>edit</b> <b>mode</b> if they have previously been completed in Story Mode. One can also adjust the gameplay by changing the watts needed for completion, how strong the gravity is, or what kind of items the player can use. The furniture and objects {{that can be used}} in <b>Edit</b> <b>Mode</b> are also dependent on the completion of Story Mode. The player must get at least a 'B' rank in a stage before they can use the stage-specific items.|$|R
50|$|The Java applet version, or Power <b>Edit</b> <b>mode,</b> {{exists for}} all three applications, {{and appears to be}} an applet port of the {{original}} desktop versions written in Java. Ajax-based Quick <b>Edit</b> <b>mode</b> (offered for Write and Show only) can run without the need of starting up an applet. Also, ThinkFree Online supports a synchronization manager utility to keep documents on the desktop, online and mobile workspaces automatically updated.|$|R

50|$|Similarly, a {{computer}} program that has two modes of operation might employ low-key feedback to keep the user informed about the current mode. If the program had a view <b>mode</b> and an <b>edit</b> <b>mode,</b> background color of the workspace might subtly change from white to pale yellow when switching to <b>edit</b> <b>mode.</b> A web browser application could {{keep track of the}} pages the user has visited and alter the colors of links that point to pages the user has already viewed.|$|R

50|$|Unlike {{previous}} DOS versions, WordPerfect 6.0 for DOS (released in 1993) could {{switch between}} its traditional text-based <b>editing</b> <b>mode</b> and a graphical <b>editing</b> <b>mode</b> {{that showed the}} document as it would print out known as WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get), including fonts. The previous text-based versions used different colors or text color inversions to indicate various markups, and (starting with version 5.0) used a graphic mode only for an uneditable print preview that used generic fonts rather than the actual fonts that appeared on the printed page.|$|E
50|$|Readline {{supports}} both Emacs and vi <b>editing</b> <b>modes,</b> which {{determine how}} keyboard input is interpreted as editor commands. See Editor war#Differences between vi and Emacs.|$|R
50|$|Another {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} Fire Pro Wrestling series of games, particularly the later games in the series, is the inclusion of an extensive and highly detailed wrestler creation and <b>edit</b> <b>mode.</b> The <b>edit</b> <b>mode</b> of Fire Pro Wrestling games allows players to build game characters {{with a high level}} of attention to detail. Appearance characteristics, such as clothing and ring attire, and physical build, head and facial features, can be customized for a created wrestler. A detailed set of wrestling and fighting moves, drawn from the large pool of moves built into each game, can also be assigned to a created wrestler. The <b>edit</b> <b>mode</b> of Fire Pro Wrestling games also allows players to make detailed changes to the CPU logic of an edited wrestler, making it possible for a skilled creator to create a wrestler that behaves very much like his real-life counterpart, even when controlled by the computer.|$|R
50|$|The {{synthesizer}} {{is always}} 'live' {{and there is}} no separate <b>edit</b> <b>mode.</b> All changes and edits to the patch can be done while the patch is playing.|$|R
50|$|Since version 1.15, {{released}} in December 2013, Calibre also contains {{an application for}} creating and editing e-books directly, similar to the more full-featured Sigil application, but without that application's WYSIWYG <b>editing</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E
50|$|Dewy's Adventure {{features}} a level <b>editing</b> <b>mode</b> that allows players to create fully customizable levels featuring different landscapes, puzzles, and enemies. This feature was {{also included in}} Elebits (Eledees in Europe and Australia), the previous Wii title by Konami.|$|E
50|$|Version 0.6 was {{released}} on 8 March 2012. It comes with sRGB lightmap rendering, a new menu interface, 4 new maps, an integrated statistics system (XonStats), a Sandbox <b>editing</b> <b>mode</b> and the long-awaited feature of ClientSide QuakeC (CSQC) networked players. Bug fixes and optimisations have also been made.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the game's standard rhythm game feature, is the ability for user-generated content in the game's <b>Edit</b> <b>Mode.</b> The <b>Edit</b> <b>Mode</b> allows users {{to create their own}} custom Promotional Video (PV) or Music Video, which either uses songs already in the game or any MP3 format music file from the player for the PV. Players can customize the video playing in the background, the various modules, backgrounds, costumes and even dance moves by the modules in the PV. Players can also modify the module's face to make the module appear to be singing so as to lip-sync the custom song to the video. Other than the <b>Edit</b> <b>Mode,</b> there is also a Diva's Room mode in which players can buy and obtain items throughout the game or from the in-game store to decorate their module's room with. Players can also take screenshots of their modules whilst they are playing in their room.|$|R
50|$|Beatmania Append 5thMIX (March 2, 2000): Append disc port of {{the arcade}} 5thMix. All new {{songs from the}} arcade were included, with several console-exclusive songs {{available}} in Bonus <b>Edit</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|R
