25|$|Particles can deposit in the nose, mouth, pharynx and larynx (the head airways region), deeper {{within the}} {{respiratory}} tract (from the trachea {{to the terminal}} bronchioles), or in the alveolar region. The location of deposition of aerosol particles within the respiratory system strongly determines {{the health effects of}} exposure to such aerosols. This phenomenon led people to invent aerosol samplers that select a subset of the aerosol particles that reach certain parts of the respiratory system. Examples of these subsets of the particle-size distribution of an aerosol, important in occupational health, include the inhalable, thoracic, and respirable fractions. The fraction that can enter each part of the respiratory system depends on the deposition of particles in the upper parts of the airway. The inhalable fraction of particles, defined as the proportion of particles originally <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>that</b> can enter the nose or mouth, depends on external wind speed and direction and on the particle-size distribution by aerodynamic diameter. The thoracic fraction is the proportion of the particles in ambient aerosol that can reach the thorax or chest region. The respirable fraction is the proportion of particles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>that</b> can reach the alveolar region. To measure the respirable fraction of particles in air, a pre-collector is used with a sampling filter. The pre-collector excludes particles as the airways remove particles from inhaled air. The sampling filter collects the particles for measurement. It is common to use cyclonic separation for the pre-collector, but other techniques include impactors, horizontal elutriators, and large pore membrane filters.|$|E
25|$|The beer is {{generally}} brewed from a grist containing approximately 60–70% barley malt and 30–40% unmalted wheat. The wort is cooled overnight in a shallow, flat metal pan called a coolship {{where it is}} left exposed to the open air so microorganisms may inoculate the wort. While this cooling method of open air exposure is a critical feature of the style, the key yeasts and bacteria that perform the fermentation reside within the breweries' timber fermenting vessels. Over eighty microorganisms {{have been identified in}} lambic beer, the most significant being Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces pastorianus and Brettanomyces bruxellensis. The process {{is generally}} only possible between October and May as in the summer months there are too many unfavourable organisms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>that</b> could spoil the beer.|$|E
25|$|We {{said this}} movie is a stylized movie, it’s not so {{different}} from the world of a musical. And there were a few other things that contributed to that direction. One was the decision on Universal’s part, a crazy decision, to shoot the movie almost entirely in the studio under a tarpaulin. They built this gigantic tarpaulin, and the Battery and all these other places were built as real places. The Richlands. And just so you know, this is the early ’80s and you had stylized films—like New York, New York—that were all done on set and that idea was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> <b>That</b> idea of a totally artificial universe. The point is that we had in mind one sentence inspired by George Lucas: “in a galaxy long ago,” a futuristic past. That was in our heads…there’s the past and there’s the future, sort of.|$|E

25|$|In October 1999, {{after the}} Kargil Conflict {{ended with the}} {{unconditional}} withdrawal of the Pakistani forces from the Indian controlled peaks, the Pakistan Army overthrew a democratically elected government once more, resulting in additional sanctions being applied against Pakistan, leading to General Pervez Musharraf coming to power in a bloodless coup. However, this time Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif sacked Musharraf {{when he was on}} his way to Pakistan from Colombo. He dismissed him as Chief of Army Staff and appointed General Ziauddin Butt to that position instead, when Musharraf's plane was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> <b>That</b> was not enough, the plane was not allowed to land at the airport in Karachi and barricades were erected on the runway. The corps commanders acted swiftly across Pakistan, particularly in Karachi and Islamabad. Brigadiar Muzaffar Usmani took control of the airport in Karachi and arrested the then Inspector General of Sindh Police, Rana Maqbool Ahmed. Musharraf stepped down as President in August 2008. On 30 July 2009, the Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled that Musharraf's imposition of emergency rule was unconstitutional.|$|E
25|$|Returning {{again to}} South Africa {{to play for}} his third {{domestic}} team in Eastern Province, Vogler scored 505 runs {{at an average of}} 36 per innings, but he set a domestic season record with fifty-five wickets in nine games for the amazing average of 10.54. By this time, Vogler had improved upon the methods of Bosanquet and Schwarz, being able not only to at a faster pace disguise which way he was turning the ball, but to flight it with skill so that it would do things <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>that</b> batsmen could not predict. Against Griqualand West in the 1906–07 Currie Cup, Vogler put in an all-round performance. Eastern Province batted upon winning the toss, and Vogler second top-scored with 79 to help his team to 403 all out. He then took 6/12 from ten overs as Griqualand West collapsed to 51 all out, and were asked to follow on. In the second innings, Vogler took all ten wickets for 26 runs, and Griqualand West were dismissed for 51 once more. Eastern Province finished as victors by an innings and 301 runs.|$|E
500|$|In the 1940s, NACA was a {{research}} and development organization, devoted to cutting-edge aeronautical research. At the Langley Research Center, advanced wind tunnels were used to test new aircraft designs, and studies were taking place on new concepts such as the X-1 rocket plane. Kraft {{was assigned to the}} flight research division, where Gilruth was then head of research. His work with NACA included the development of an early example of gust alleviation system for an aircraft flying in turbulent air. [...] This involved correcting for variations in the atmosphere by automatically deflecting the control surfaces. He also discovered that wingtip vortices, and not prop-wash, are responsible for most of the turbulence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>that</b> trails flying aircraft. This finding was forgotten and later rediscovered independently.|$|E

Smith was inducted into the Hall of Fame during ceremonies on July 28, 2002. During his speech, he compared his baseball experiences with the characters from the novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, after which his son Dustin presented his Hall of Fame plaque. Days later on August 11, Smith was back at Busch Memorial Stadium for the unveiling of a statue in his likeness made by sculptor Harry Weber. Weber chose to emphasize Smith's defensive skills by showing Smith stretched horizontal to the ground while fielding a baseball. At the ceremony Weber told Smith, [...] "You spent half of your career up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> <b>That</b> makes it difficult for a sculptor to do something with it." ...|$|E

The song {{was performed}} while ballet dancers from the Bolshoi Theatre, who danced alongside Gaga in a performance art number directed by artist Francesco Vezzoli and members of Russia's Bolshoi Ballet Academy, titled [...] "The Shortest Musical You Will Never See Again." [...] It was performed at the 2009 American Music Awards. She coupled it with [...] "Bad Romance" [...] from The Fame Monster. Gaga was dressed in a flesh-colored bodysuit wrapped with white piping, embedded with flashing lights imitating ribs and a spine. The performance started with [...] "Bad Romance"; then she segued into [...] "Speechless" [...] by using her microphone stand to break open a glass box with a piano inside. She sat on the piano bench and began the performance, while her piano caught on fire. Throughout the song, she continued to smash liquor bottles on the piano. Both [...] "Bad Romance" [...] and [...] "Speechless" [...] were performed at The Ellen DeGeneres Show on November 25, 2009. Gaga performed the song at the Royal Variety Performance, which was attended by Queen Elizabeth II.

[...] A number of his works, including Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks and Lost Highway are intentionally reminiscent of the 1950s American culture despite being set in the later decades of the 20th century. Lynch stated that [...] "It was a fantastic decade {{in a lot of}} ways... there was something <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>that</b> is not there any more at all.

[...] In a 2009 interview, gay historian David Carter stated that this connection is untrue, and based on a mocking reference to the riot by an anti-gay writer in The Village Voice the next day. Some observers of the riots contend that most of those involved [...] "were not the type to moon over Judy Garland records or attend her concerts at Carnegie Hall. They were more preoccupied with where they were going to sleep and where their next meal would come from." [...] However, the same historical documentary states that there were several patrons at the Stonewall bar that night, Garland fans who, according to bar patron Sylvia Rivera had come from the very emotional Garland funeral earlier in the day to drink and mourn.

2500|$|The album itself {{received}} generally positive reviews by the UK critics, Keith Cameron of the NME {{gave the}} record {{seven out of}} ten in his review. Cameron compared Suede to The Smiths; he wrote, [...] "'Suede' faces the same problems [...] and similarly fails to deliver on a few, admittedly trifling, levels". However, he concluded, [...] "This is the solid, quality, ring-of-confidence debut [...] dreamed the band would produce". Stuart Maconie of Q gave the album 4 out of 5 stars. In his review he drew comparisons to Bowie, Morrissey and Marr. In conclusion he said [...] "Bowie and the Smiths are obvious points of reference. From each, Suede have taken an alien sexual charisma, a peculiarly claustrophobic Englishness and brazenly good tunes. Moreover, rarely has a record from the indie sector come with such a burning sense of its own significance." [...] In Select, Steve Lamacq noted [...] "a feeling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>that</b> they haven't fully let themselves go yet", concluding: [...] "As debuts go this isn't exactly Suede in flames: but what a smouldering attempt."
