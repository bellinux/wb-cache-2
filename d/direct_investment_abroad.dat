Object of the research: foreign direct investment and its impact of Lithuanian economics. Goal of the research: estimation of the impact of foreign direct investment on Lithuanian economics. Tasks of the research: 1. 	Discussing the issue and dynamics of foreign direct investment in Lithuania; 2. 	Showing theoretical aspects of foreign direct investment and its impact; 3. 	Defining the course of the research of the impact of FDI attracted by Lithuania and Lithuanian <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> <b>abroad</b> on Lithuanian economics; 4. 	Assessing the impact of foreign direct investment attracted by Lithuania on Lithuanian economics; 5. 	Assessing the impact of Lithuanian <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> <b>abroad</b> on Lithuanian economics. 6. 	Assessing the relationship between Lithuanian competitiveness and attracted foreign direct investments. Results of the research. The research of the impact of foreign direct investment on Lithuanian economics has shown that foreign direct investment attracted by Lithuania has a significant linear relation with the average gross salary in the economy of the country, import, export and GDP. Estimation of the dependence of all these variables and their correlation strength has indicated that 86. 9 % of Lithuanian export is conditioned by foreign direct investment. This significant impact on export {{can be explained by the}} fact that most part of investments attracted to Lithuania is directed to the sector of production; therefore, growth of this segment also determines an increase in exports. Analysing of the impact of Lithuanian <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> <b>abroad</b> has shown that has a significant linear relation with the average gross salary in the economy of the country, import, export, GDP and inflation. When assessing all these variables, the highest dependence was established among <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> <b>abroad</b> and export and GDP. The impact of <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> <b>abroad</b> on Lithuanian export amounts to 84. 1 %, while on GDP – to 83. 2 %. Such an influence of <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> <b>abroad</b> on Lithuanian export and GDP can be explained by the fact that involvement of Lithuania in foreign countries and markets is especially significant due to different reasons such as development of production and growth of export, import and price decrease, increase in salary and purchasing power what influence the whole Lithuanian economics. Regardless of FDI impact on Lithuanian economics, it has been established that Lithuania is not a competitive country attracting investment, because it is approximately in place 40 th among the countries involved in the research of the competitiveness of countries around the world. The main shortfalls of Lithuania is a small size of the country what means a small market of consumers and lack of them as well as poor business and institutional environment what mostly frightens investors. However, Lithuania is a strong country because of its geographical position and consolidation of Scandinavian countries and their business in Lithuania; therefore, the interest of foreign countries in Lithuania might be higher if Lithuania managed to change different policies restricting investment and business...|$|E

Both the Middle East (down from over 9% to under 1%) and the Pacific (down from roughly 8% to 6%) became relatively less important locations for Japanese investments.

However, current evidence {{on the impact of}} international trade on the relative wages and employment of unskilled workers is mixed at best.

Trade liberalization is measured by imports, exports, foreign direct investment, and immigration. The explanatory variables of both equations thus consist of these variables plus labor productivity. Labor productivity is included mainly to serve as a control variable. The empirical results suggest that an increase in exports significantly increases the relative wage of unskilled workers, whereas increases in foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> <b>abroad</b> and immigration both significantly reduce the relative wage of unskilled workers.

The investments in Europe and the United States are mostly market seeking investments. Research specifically focused on Chinese M&A abroad comes to the same conclusion. The success rate of Chinese M&A abroad is much lower than what we see with respect to American or European <b>investments</b> <b>abroad.</b> In this paper, we examine why Chinese firms are facing more difficulties in the European Union than in other regions. The paper focuses on Chinese M&A as proxy for total foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investments</b> <b>abroad.</b> By looking at the factors that have been documented as influencing the level of M&A abroad, it becomes clear that Chinese firms in Europe are hindered by many factors. For example, the trade between China and the EU is relatively low, the institutional quality is lower compared to the United States, there is less experience with respect to Europe and relatively many deals relate to State Owned Enterprises (SOE) which makes the deal sensitive. So it is logical that Chinese investments are not very high in Europe. However, the research makes clear that the obstacles for Chinese investments in Europe are disappearing step by step.
