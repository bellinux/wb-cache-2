Generally BLDC motors have found wide applications such as: electrical vehicles, industries, home appliances, etc. There are many factors which cause torque ripple and acoustic noise in BLDC motors. The unbalanced motor has the major role in the creation of torque ripple and acoustic noise. There are many reasons to the imbalanced air gap, which is the most common fault in asymmetric rotors such as: <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> the <b>axle</b> or shaft due to the lack of proper design, lack of proper casting or inaccuracy arises in the factory. However, the asymmetry in the rotor which is caused by an imbalanced air gap, causes the differences in air gap flux, so, the vertical and tangential forces will be unbalanced which leads to the production of vibration and acoustic noses. In this paper, a new mapping is used to replace the IPM motor with it’s SPM motor counterpart with the same treatments. For this purpose, the reluctance of the magnetic circuits of the motors in both cases should be equivalent and the dimension of the surface magnet is achieved. Then, Ansoft-Maxwell software is used to simulate the air gap flux density i...|$|R

30|$|For {{differential}} braking control: (1) In general, to prevent rollover or oversteer accidents, braking on outside wheels <b>on</b> <b>axles</b> {{in front of}} the CG point can generate a larger extra yaw moment than <b>on</b> rear <b>axles.</b> (2) To prevent understeering, braking on the inside wheels <b>on</b> <b>axles</b> after the CG point can generate better effects than braking <b>on</b> the front <b>axles.</b> (3) The largest yaw moment changes generated by braking on each wheel are limited not only by initial forces of the tires, ability of air braking system, and steering angle but also by distances between the axles and CG position. (4) In terms of braking wheel, when the root of the quadratic sum of braking force and lateral force is equal to the radius of Kamm’s Circle, braking wheels <b>on</b> the rear <b>axle</b> need a complex control logic. When the truck is in the danger of drifting, braking <b>on</b> front <b>axles</b> is a better choice.|$|R
