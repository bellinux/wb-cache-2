5|$|During {{the first}} Five-Year Plan, various public works and {{programs}} were executed, {{with the aim}} to modernize the country's infrastructure. For example, a total of 22 hydroelectrical power plants were erected, increasing <b>electrical</b> <b>output</b> from 45000 kVA in 1943, to 350000 kVA in 1952.|$|E
5|$|The LIFE concept {{stopped working}} along fusion-fission lines around 2009. Following {{consultations}} with their {{partners in the}} utility industry, the project was redirected toward a pure fusion design with a net <b>electrical</b> <b>output</b> around 1 gigawatt.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{power was}} {{supplied}} by eight generators. Four were turbo-generators designed for naval use; these provided 1,250kilowatts each. The other four were diesel generators that supplied 850kilowatts each. Two smaller diesel generators—each provided 200kilowatts—supplied emergency power should the main system be damaged. Total <b>electrical</b> <b>output</b> was 8,400kilowatts, {{not including the}} emergency generators, at 450volts on an alternating current.|$|E
40|$|A {{method and}} system are {{provided}} for sensing {{the position of}} a rotor in a hybrid stepper motor. First and second Hall sensors are positioned in a spaced-apart relationship with the first and second armatures of the rotor such that the first and second Hall sensors generate <b>electrical</b> <b>outputs</b> that are 90. degree. out of phase with one another as the rotor rotates. The <b>electrical</b> <b>outputs</b> are adjusted relative to a reference, and the amplitude of the <b>electrical</b> <b>outputs</b> is further adjusted to account for spacing differences between the rotor and each of the first and second Hall sensors...|$|R

5|$|Steering was {{controlled}} by a single rudder. Admiral Hipper and Blücher were equipped with three electricity plants with four diesel generators and six turbo-generators each; the diesel generators supplied 150kW apiece, {{four of the six}} turbo-generators provided 460kW, and the final pair provided 230kW. Total <b>electrical</b> <b>output</b> was 2900kW. Prinz Eugen, Seydlitz, and Lützow were equipped with three 150kW diesel generators, four 460kW turbo-generators, one 230kW turbo-generator, and one 150kW AC generator, for a total of 2870kW. All five ships' electrical plants operated at 220volts.|$|E
5|$|Comparing {{the driver}} energy input to the fusion energy output {{produces}} a number known as fusion energy gain factor, labelled Q. A Q value {{of at least}} 1 {{is required for the}} system to produce net energy. Since some energy is needed to run the reactor, in order for there to be net <b>electrical</b> <b>output,</b> Q has to be at least 3. For commercial operation, Q values much higher than this are needed. For ICF, Qs on the order of 25 to 50 are needed to recoup both the electrical generation losses and the large amount of power used to power the driver. In the fall of 1960, theoretical work carried out at LLNL suggested that gains of the required order would be possible with drivers on the order of 1MJ.|$|E

5000|$|Changes in laws. In some jurisdictions, {{certain types}} of <b>electrical</b> <b>outputs</b> for fences were {{unlawful}} until the 1950s or 1960s. In other areas, signage requirements and other restrictions limited usability. Many US cities continue to have outdated laws prohibiting electric fences to prevent agricultural fences from entering the city. Houston in Texas for example, changed their ordinance that prohibited electric fencing in 2008.|$|R
25|$|Design of the CVTR began around 1955. CVTR had {{a thermal}} output of about 65 MWth and a gross <b>electrical</b> <b>output</b> of 19 MW. Westinghouse Atomic Power Division was {{responsible}} for the design of the nuclear systems while Stone and Webster Engineering designed the remainder of the plant.|$|E
25|$|The Board was a success. By 1939 <b>electrical</b> <b>output</b> was up {{fourfold}} and generating costs had fallen. Consumers {{of electricity}} rose from {{three-quarters of a}} million in 1920 to nine million in 1938, with annual growth of 700,000 to 800,000 a year (the fastest rate {{of growth in the}} world).|$|E

25|$|Some {{stationary}} bicycles {{have been fitted}} with generators and batteries, {{and at least one}} US patents has been granted. Usually the amount of useful electrical energy generated or collected is low because neither generators nor batteries are very efficient, and initially power is lost in converting reciprocating muscular power to rotatory force. These problems are surmountable, there are designs to produce up to 120W <b>electrical</b> <b>output</b> for extended time.|$|E
25|$|Several {{companies}} have begun embedding power optimizers into PV modules called smart modules. These modules perform {{maximum power point}} tracking (MPPT) for each module individually, measure performance data for monitoring, and provide additional safety features. Such modules can also compensate for shading effects, wherein a shadow falling across a section of a module causes the <b>electrical</b> <b>output</b> of one or more strings of cells in the module to decrease.|$|E
25|$|As the {{throttle}} is moved to higher power notches, the fuel rate {{to the prime}} mover will increase, resulting in a corresponding increase in RPM and horsepower output. At the same time, main generator field excitation will be proportionally increased to absorb the higher power. This will translate into increased <b>electrical</b> <b>output</b> to the traction motors, with a corresponding increase in tractive force. Eventually, depending on {{the requirements of the}} train's schedule, the engine driver will have moved {{the throttle}} to the position of maximum power and will maintain it there until the train has accelerated to the desired speed.|$|E

25|$|When {{turned on}} or opened, the AED will {{instruct}} {{the user to}} connect the electrodes (pads) to the patient. Once the pads are attached, everyone should avoid touching the patient {{so as to avoid}} false readings by the unit. The pads allow the AED to examine the <b>electrical</b> <b>output</b> from the heart and determine if the patient is in a shockable rhythm (either ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia). If the device determines that a shock is warranted, it will use the battery to charge its internal capacitor in preparation to deliver the shock. This system is not only safer (charging only when required), but also allows for a faster delivery of the electric current.|$|E
25|$|Generally {{the plug}} is the movable {{connector}} attached to an electrically operated device's mains cable, and the socket is fixed on equipment or a building structure {{and connected to}} an energised electrical circuit. The plug has protruding pins or, in US terminology, blades (referred to as male) that fit into matching slots or holes (called female) in the sockets. A plug is defined in IEC 60050 as an accessory having pins designed to engage with the contacts of a socket-outlet, also incorporating means for the electrical connection and mechanical retention of flexible cables or cords; a plug does not contain components which modify the <b>electrical</b> <b>output</b> from the electrical input (except where a switch and/or fuse is provided {{as a means of}} disconnecting the output from input). There is an erroneous tendency to refer to power conversion devices with incorporated plug pins as plugs, but IEC 60050 refers to these as 'direct plug-in equipment', defined as equipment in which the mains plug forms {{an integral part of the}} equipment enclosure so that the equipment is supported by the mains socket-outlet. In this article, the term 'plug' is used in the sense defined by IEC 60050. Sockets are designed to prevent exposure of bare energised contacts. Sockets may also have protruding exposed contacts, but these are used exclusively for grounding (earthing).|$|E

The synchronisation capabilities of the circuit have potentially novel functions for optical communications systems including clock recovery, clock division and data encryption...|$|R
50|$|Electromyography (EMG) {{is a tool}} used {{to measure}} the <b>electrical</b> <b>outputs</b> {{produced}} by skeletal muscles upon activation. Motor nerves innervate skeletal muscles and cause contraction upon command from the central nervous system. This contraction is measured by EMG and is typically measured on the scale of millivolts (mV). Another form of EMG data that is analyzed is integrated EMG (iEMG) data. iEMG measures the area under the EMG signal which corresponds to the overall muscle effort rather than the effort at a specific instant.|$|R
50|$|Due to Economies of scale, modern {{nuclear plants}} {{tend to be}} built with larger <b>electrical</b> <b>outputs,</b> such as the European Pressurized Reactor, which has scaled up power to 1600 MW in new plants. IRIS, on the other hand, is built {{to be used in}} {{countries}} where there are not extremely large electric power grids, mainly developing nations. Due to limitations on power of individual power stations versus total grid size, plants whose power is over a certain percentage of grid size are infeasible in such situations.|$|R

She contributed landing parties to Admiral Edward Seymour's relief force, based in Tientsin. In 1902, the ship returned to Germany for an extensive overhaul, which began in 1903, and lasted until 1907. During the refit, the ship's generators were replaced with more powerful units that more than doubled <b>electrical</b> <b>output,</b> at 124kW at 110V.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the first steps}} in developing innovative cement-based batteries to power cathodic protection in reinforced concrete structures. Initial <b>electrical</b> <b>outputs</b> of 1. 55 V and 23 mA {{have been found to}} be sufficient to polarise prescribed corrosion currents of 20 mA per m 2 of embedded steel. Cathodic protection is a well-developed and powerful technique to limit the effects of steel reinforcement corrosion. However, as it requires an electrical supply day and night, it is often powered by non-environmentally friendly diesel generators or connected to the electrical grid. This paper focuses on increasing the ionic conductivity of the solution in the cement pores, increasing the porosity of the cement, examining ways of sealing moisture into the cement and comparing different electrode materials and treatments. The batteries presented consist of different combinations of Portland cement, water, carbon black and salt solutions with embedded copper acting as the cathode and magnesium, aluminium or zinc cast as the anode. The preliminary findings demonstrate that cementbased batteries can produce sufficient sustainable <b>electrical</b> <b>outputs</b> with the correct materials and arrangement of cast-in anodes. Work is ongoing to determine how these batteries can be recharged using photovoltaics which will further enhance their sustainability properties...|$|R
