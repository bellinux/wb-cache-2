5|$|I {{heard about}} drowned farms and hamlets, the ruination of the salmon-fishing and how Inverness might be washed away if the dams failed inland. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> about the huge veins of crystal they found {{when they were}} {{tunnelling}} deep under the mountains.|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> by my {{publishers}} that Cher {{heard my}} version and she doesn't like my new lyrics. She thinks it's too overtly sexual. But the original writers were happy {{for me to}} do that—Cher didn't actually write it so she didn't get approval about what happened to the song. Now apparently she's heard what I've done and she doesn't like it.|$|E
5|$|Being like Lofty was {{something}} I aspired to without realising it. When I joined the Regiment <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> {{that the best}} way to survive those first years in the Sabre squadron was to pick out someone who you thought you would like to be. Shut up, watch and listen. For me there were a number of the 'old and bold' who fitted that requirement. It wasn't until later in my service that I learned that most of them, as newly 'badged' members to a squadron, had picked Lofty.|$|E

60|$|A {{woman has}} died. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> that her blood {{is on my}} hands; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> that on my hands is the {{starvation}} and the suffering of other women and of children.|$|R
6000|$|... "I did not expect," [...] Francis answered, [...] "ever {{to be in}} England again. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> that my {{recovery}} <b>was</b> a miracle. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> also <b>told</b> that <b>I</b> owe my Life to you!" ...|$|R
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> he was {{handing out}} a few theatre tickets and I didn't suspect {{anything}} because he always looked after the boys. He was close {{to a number of}} players, obviously a lot closer than I understood at the time. I didn't have any hint that it wasn't him just organising something for the boys to go to that night.|$|E
25|$|Joe {{devastated the}} IRA in west Belfast in the mid-1980s. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> {{he loved his}} work and got {{a great deal of}} {{pleasure}} after operations were compromised. He was a very willing agent and tried on at least two occasions to entrap senior republicans. But it was probably {{only a matter of time}} before he was caught out and by late 1988 he was under suspicion.|$|E
25|$|Certainly the mullas {{do their}} best to keep the fair sex in their place, and are in the habit of beating those who show their faces in the Great Bazar. But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> that poetic justice had lately been meted out to one of these upholders of the law of Islam, for by mistake he chastised a Kashgari woman married to a Chinaman, whereupon the irate husband set upon him with a big stick and castigated him soundly.|$|E
60|$|All great {{literary}} men <b>are</b> shy. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> myself, though <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> it <b>is</b> hardly noticeable.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> that <b>I</b> {{owe it to}} you {{to leave}} proof of my death behind me.|$|R
60|$|AMERICAN. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> that <b>is</b> not {{uncommon}} amongst babies. Perhaps {{we could have}} you inform us, ma'am.|$|R
25|$|I'm really {{pissed off}} with the BBC for {{bringing}} down my first three episodes to two and, in doing so, taking out much of the vital politics. What also makes me very grumpy is that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> that the cuts had been introduced by the BBC because they thought British viewers already knew the historical background. But all that's happened {{as far as the}} viewer is concerned is that it has made Rome hard to follow.|$|E
25|$|It {{became a}} burden. Some {{people say it}} helped me invent {{the kind of music}} I play, but I don’t know whether it did. It’s just {{something}} I’ve had to learn to live with. It affects your playing style; you can’t feel the strings, and there are certain chords I can’t play. Right at the beginning <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> by doctors: “You won’t be playing guitar.” But I believed I could do it, and I did.|$|E
25|$|I enquired {{throughout}} Italy at what place {{boys were}} chiefly qualified for singing by castration, but could get no certain intelligence. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> at Milan {{that it was}} at Venice; at Venice that it was at Bologna; but at Bologna the fact was denied, and I was referred to Florence; from Florence to Rome, and from Rome I was sent to Naples... {{it is said that}} there are shops in Naples with this inscription: 'QUI SI CASTRANO RAGAZZI' ("Here boys are castrated"); but I was utterly unable to see or hear of any such shops during my residence in that city.|$|E

6000|$|... “The Alcalde <b>is,</b> <b>I</b> think, {{scarcely}} wise, {{but he is}} a loyal gentleman,” he said. “We {{will pass}} over him. The Senor Sanchez who, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told,</b> <b>is</b> regarded with respect in Santa Marta, will, perhaps, recommend five citizens of integrity.” ...|$|R

25|$|Reflecting on {{her work}} in musical films, Powell said: People are always fascinated by the {{so-called}} golden age of musicals, but it wasn’t all that great. Everything was glazed. Those movies didn’t reflect reality. I was at MGM for 11 years and nobody ever let me play anything but teenagers. I was 25 years old with kids of my own and it was getting ridiculous. Publicity was froth. Everything you said was monitored. With me, they didn’t have to worry. I never had anything to say, anyway. It was hard work, I had no friends, no social interaction with people my age and the isolation was tough. But I had to support my family, so I did what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> and had no other choice.|$|E
25|$|Dr Oliver, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told,</b> … had a liking and a ′flair′ for the {{invention}} of simple appliances, with which observations and experiments could {{be made on the}} human subject. Dr Oliver had invented a small instrument with which he claimed to be able to measure, through the unbroken skin, the diameter of a living artery, such as the radial artery at the wrist. He appears to have used his family in his experiments, and a young son {{was the subject of a}} series, in which Dr Oliver measured the diameter of the radial artery, and observed the effect upon it of injecting extracts of various animal glands under the skin. … We may picture, then, Professor Schafer, in the old physiological laboratory at University College, … finishing an experiment of some kind, in which he was recording the arterial blood pressure of an anaesthetised dog. … To him enters Dr Oliver, with the story of the experiments on his boy, and, in particular, with the statement that injection under the skin of a glycerin extract from calf’s suprarenal gland was followed by a definite narrowing of the radial artery. Professor Schafer is said to have been entirely sceptical, and to have attributed the observation to self-delusion. … He can hardly be blamed, I think; knowing even what we now know about the action of this extract, which of us would be prepared to believe that injecting it under a boy’s skin would cause his radial artery to become measurably more slender? Dr Oliver, however, is persistent; he … suggests that, at least, it will do no harm to inject into the circulation, through a vein, a little of the suprarenal extract, which he produces from his pocket. So Professor Schafer makes the injection, expecting a triumphant demonstration of nothing, and finds himself standing ′like some watcher of the skies, when a new planet swims into his ken,′ watching the mercury rise in the manometer with amazing rapidity and to an astounding height.|$|E
500|$|The {{writer of}} the ceremony, Frank Cottrell Boyce, said: [...] "People around us thought it might need defending, so <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> to do press the next morning. I was {{completely}} surprised [...] [...] A {{lot of people were}} surprised. [...] But I don't think Danny was surprised. [...] Danny never blinked. At no point did he show any feeling {{that it was going to}} be anything but amazing. [...] And he was right." ...|$|E

60|$|You are a {{literary}} man, Mr. Hood, and have written, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told,</b> some things worth reading. <b>I</b> say <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told,</b> because <b>I</b> never read what {{is written in}} these days. You'll excuse me; but my principle is, that no man ought {{to know anything about}} his own time, except that it is the worst time that ever was, or is ever likely to be. That is the only way, sir, to be truly wise and happy.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{cannot be}} my knight," [...] replied Lady Roehampton, [...] "because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> the {{sovereign}} {{of all the}} chivalry, but you have my best wishes." ...|$|R
500|$|It was {{the first}} gold medal that Germany had won in women's {{wheelchair}} basketball at the Paralympics since 1984. They were awarded the Silver Laurel Leaf by President Joachim Gauck in November 2012, and were named Team of the Year for 2012. [...] "Many times, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> that after winning a gold medal, I have achieved the most I can, so I could quit now," [...] Adermann later wrote, [...] "But I disagree." ...|$|E
500|$|The dead of our army {{are still}} denied the rites of sepulture. ... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> the hogs were eating them. A gentleman {{told me he}} had seen them running about with skulls, arms, legs {{and other parts of the}} human system in their mouths. The French people on the Raisin buried Captains Hart, Woolfolk, and some others, but it was more than their lives were worth to have been caught paying this last customed tribute to mortality." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} the battle, US Air Force assets {{had flown}} 9,691 {{tactical}} sorties and dropped 14,223tons of bombs on targets within the Khe Sanh area. Marine Corps aviators had flown 7,098 missions and released 17,015tons. Naval aircrews, many of whom were redirected from Operation Rolling Thunder strikes against North Vietnam, flew 5,337 sorties and dropped 7,941 tons of ordnance in the area. Westmoreland later wrote that [...] "Washington so feared that some word of it might reach the press that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> to desist, ironically answering what those consequences could be: a political disaster." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{just where}} he is most lucky of all," [...] {{answered}} the young lady to whom <b>I</b> <b>was</b> talking--it was Scroope's fiancée, Miss Manners--"for he is engaged to a lady that, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told,</b> <b>is</b> the loveliest, sweetest, cleverest girl in all England, and they absolutely adore each other." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told.</b> She {{ought to}} know her way about the place, as <b>I</b> {{remember}} she <b>was</b> at the same work when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a girl of eleven." ...|$|R

500|$|New Line Cinema (one-time video {{distributor}} of the original) acquired {{the rights to}} the film from co-rights holder StudioCanal, who will control the European rights, and Carpenter, who will serve as an executive producer and said, [...] "Snake is one of my fondest creations. Kurt Russell did an incredible job, and {{it would be fun to}} see someone else try." [...] Russell has commented on the remake and on the casting of Butler as Plissken, saying, [...] "I will say that when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> who was going to play Snake Plissken, my initial reaction was 'Oh, man!' [...] I do think that character was quintessentially one thing. And that is, American." ...|$|E
500|$|Ferguson {{was delighted}} in how his team coped with the pitchside temperatures: [...] "You {{had to be}} down there to {{appreciate}} it. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> it was 41 degrees on the pitch – I know I was roasting just watching them." [...] When asked about Howard's positioning for Arsenal's equaliser, he replied: [...] "Tim wanted three in the wall and he will learn from that. This isn't America." [...] Silvestre denied suggestions that the win gave United a psychological edge over Arsenal: [...] "This is still a pre-season game. We won the Premiership title with a strong run {{at the end of}} last season." [...] Howard was unsure whether he would displace Barthez in the first team for a prolonged run – [...] "that's not my decision", though continued [...] "We have four great goalkeepers and we're looking to have a good battle all season long." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Battle of the Bastards" [...] {{was also}} the last episode for {{recurring}} character Rickon Stark (Art Parkinson), who had appeared since the series premiere episode [...] "Winter Is Coming". In an IGN interview, Parkinson {{said that he was}} tipped off about his character's death: [...] "Whenever <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> that I was coming back for Season 6, before they sent me through the scripts and stuff, they sent me through a ring just to say, 'Listen, so that you don't get a shock whenever you read the scripts, just know that you die this season. He continued, [...] "Whenever I came back, I was excited to come back, and the scenes all seemed pretty amazing. I was so happy to re-embrace the character." [...] According to Parkinson, he was sorry that Rickon would die but his manner of death was a compensation: [...] "It was a cool death, and it was {{always going to be a}} good death, so at the same time, I was pretty happy." ...|$|E
