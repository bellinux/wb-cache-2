5|$|Cleveland {{finished}} the 1947 {{season with a}} 12–1–1 win-loss-tie record and beat the New York Yankees to win its second straight AAFC championship. While the team was successful <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>first</b> two years of existence, head coach Paul Brown made numerous roster changes before the 1948 season. He brought in linebacker Alex Agase and defensive tackle Chubby Grigg via a trade with the Chicago Rockets. Tommy James, a defensive back who stayed with the team through the 1955 season, came from the National Football League's Detroit Lions. Defensive back Warren Lahr also joined the team but did not play in 1948 after breaking a leg in the preseason.|$|E

A three-run homer by Kemp in the fourth inning and one run surrendered in 7 2/3rd innings pitched by Foltynewicz was enough to secure a 3-1 win for the Braves in the second game of the series. The Braves concluded the series by surrendering four homers in a 13-4 loss to the Giants.|$|E

25|$|This game {{marked the}} first meeting between Auburn and Pac-10 {{opponent}} Washington State, although Auburn was 4–3 in previous Pac-10 matchups. Auburn entered the game looking to defend its preseason rankings and avoid stumbling as {{in a similar situation}} in 2003. The Cougars, coached by Bill Doba, traveled to Auburn hoping to test the Tiger defense under new defensive coordinator Will Muschamp with a high-flying passing game featuring returning QB Alex Brink and potential All-American receiver and first-round draft choice Jason Hill. Auburn met the challenge, forcing Wazzou to go three-and-out on their first two possessions including three sacks of Brink <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>first</b> six offensive plays. Auburn stalled on their first two drives and settled for John Vaughn field goals to take a 6–0 lead.|$|E
25|$|Although {{intended}} as a one-off story focusing on Superboy, the Legion proved so popular that it returned for an encore in Adventure Comics #267 (December 1959). In this story, Lightning Boy had been renamed Lightning Lad, and their costumes were very close to those they wore throughout the Silver Age of Comic Books. The Legion's popularity grew, and they appeared in further stories in Adventure Comics, Action Comics, and other titles edited by Mort Weisinger {{over the next few}} years. The ranks of the Legion, only hinted at <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>first</b> two stories, was filled with new heroes such as Chameleon Boy, Invisible Kid, Colossal Boy, Star Boy, Brainiac 5, Triplicate Girl, Shrinking Violet, Sun Boy, Bouncing Boy, Phantom Girl, and Ultra Boy.

25|$|Later that year, Coventry was {{selected}} to play his first senior game for Collingwood against St Kilda. He did not make an immediate impact and at times looked clumsy, but did enough to ensure he kept his spot after two valuable seasons. His brother, Syd Coventry was also be welcomed at the club, in 1922. Gordon had kicked 32 goals <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>first</b> two seasons, but played in his prime position in the losing grand final side of 1920 where he kicked {{more than half of}} Collingwood's score. In 1922 Coventry moved closer to goals and as the team continued its dominance, Coventry became a focal point, and in 1923 would win the club's goal kicking with 42 goals. Coventry did not possess the phenomenal skills of his predecessor Dick Lee or the aerial prowess of his successor Ron Todd, but relied on tremendous strength and a vice-like grip when marking the ball, a combination that made him almost unstoppable once he had front position.|$|E

500|$|Berry {{was famous}} for his {{attention}} to detail and preparation, which he used to overcome his physical limitations. Considered slow for a wide receiver, he ran the 40-yard dash in 4.8 seconds. Rather than speed, he was renowned for his precise pass patterns and sure hands; he rarely dropped passes, and he fumbled only once in his career. He would squeeze Silly Putty constantly to strengthen his hands. He and Unitas regularly worked after practice and developed the timing and knowledge of each other's abilities that made each more effective. The reason for this, according to Berry, was that the two did not think on the same wavelength. [...] "Every season we had {{to start all over}} on our timing, especially the long ball," [...] said Berry. [...] "He knew he had to release the ball when I was eighteen yards from scrimmage for me to receive it thirty-eight yards out. I knew I had to make my break <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>first</b> eighteen yards and get free within 2.8 seconds." [...] He also relied on shifty moves, and by his count, he had 88 different moves to get open, all of which he practiced every week.|$|E

When the producers knew Macfadyen planned to leave, they did not know whether or not he would appear {{in the beginning of the}} third series. Howard Brenton, who wrote the series two finale, originally killed Tom off by drowning him while trying to escape onto the North Sea, while labouring under the impression that he was not to return. The producers would have continued the third series without Tom, however when they heard the actor would be prepared to return for the first two episodes of the third series, they were rewritten to include his character Tom. Brenton had to [...] "unkill him."

2500|$|Yolande Cornelia [...] "Nikki" [...] Giovanni, Jr. {{was born}} in Knoxville, Tennessee, to Yolande Cornelia, Sr. and Jones [...] "Gus" [...] Giovanni. Soon after her birth, {{the family moved to}} Cincinnati, Ohio where her parents worked at Glenview School. In 1948, the family moved to Wyoming, and {{sometime}} <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>first</b> three years, Giovanni’s sister, Gary, began calling her “Nikki.” In 1958, Giovanni moved to Knoxville, TN to live with her grandparents and attend Austin High School. In 1960, she began her studies at her grandfather's alma mater, Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee as an “Early Entrant” which meant that she could enroll in college without having finished high school first. She immediately clashed with the Dean of Women, Ann Cheatam, and was expelled after neglecting to obtain the required permission from the Dean to leave campus and travel home for Thanksgiving break. Giovanni moved back to Knoxville where she worked at a Walgreen’s Drug Store and helped care for her nephew, Christopher. In 1964, Giovanni spoke with the new Dean of Women at Fisk University, Blanche McConnell Cowan (“Jackie”), who urged Giovanni to return to Fisk that fall. While at Fisk, Giovanni edited a student literary journal (titled Èlan), reinstated the campus chapter of SNCC (Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee), and published an essay in Negro Digest on gender questions in the Movement. In 1967, she graduated with honors with a B.A. in History.|$|E

While at NYU, she {{played a central role}} in the {{university}} administration's efforts around union contracts with adjunct faculty and graduate students. The Washington Post reported in October 2015 that, during Mills' first four months at the State Department, she continued to work at NYU on a part-time basis, negotiating with officials in Abu Dhabi to build a campus in the United Arab Emirates city. She worked for no pay <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>first</b> months at the State Department, and was officially designated as a [...] "temporary expert-consultant", which allowed her to continue receiving outside income while serving as Clinton's Chief of Staff. On her financial disclosure forms, she reported $198,000 in income from NYU in 2009, during the period her university work overlapped with her time at the State Department, and that she collected an additional $330,000 in vacation and severance payments when she left the university’s payroll in May 2009. Additionally, Mills remained on the Clinton Foundation’s unpaid board for a short time after joining the State Department. Another Clinton aide, Huma Abedin, spent her final six months employed as Clinton’s deputy chief of staff in 2012, while also simultaneously employed by the Clinton Foundation. As has Abedin's, Mills’ employment arrangement has raised questions regarding potential conflicts of interest, in Mills' case about how one of the State Department’s top employees set boundaries between her public role and a private job that involved work on a project funded by a foreign government. Under Federal ethics laws, employees are prohibited from participating in matters that would have any direct and predictable effect on themselves or an outside employer. Mills told the Washington Post that she did not “recall any issues” at the State Department that would have required her recusing herself, and said she would have consulted with the ethics office if such an issue had come up. Nick Merrill, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, declined to comment.|$|E

40|$|In Germany {{the life}} {{satisfaction}} of <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>first</b> marriages traces the following average course.

In the year of marriage and that immediately following, the life satisfaction of <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>first</b> marriages, prior cohabitors and noncohabitors combined, increases to a value even further above the baseline, significantly higher than for premarital cohabitors. Thereafter, life satisfaction of <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>first</b> marriages drops, but remains significantly above the baseline, {{at the same level}} as for premarital cohabitors.

This group differs significantly from the first marriage population as a whole in its selectivity – lower socioeconomic status and personality traits less conducive to marriage.
