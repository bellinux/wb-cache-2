Do they sell crabs, shrimps, winkles, herrings? The oyster-openers--what do they do?

With large fire-places and generous heat, some windows may be open all the time, and without hardship all the windows can be opened every little while and the rooms flushed with clean pure air. I have nearly died in the stagnant, rotten air of other people's houses--especially in the Eastern states. In Maine I have slept {{in a room with}} storm-windows immovable, and with one small pane five inches by six, that could be opened. Did I say slept? I panted with my mouth in the opening and blasphemed till I ruined all my chances of heaven.|$|E
30|$|Multiple {{types of}} cells are well {{organized}} in BBB, which include endothelial cells, astrocytes, and pericytes (Zhao et al., 2015; Attwell et al., 2010; Knowland et al., 2014; Armulik et al., 2010; Dalkara and Alarcon-Martinez, 2015). Among these cells, astrocytes {{are the most}} abundant cells in the brain, which wrap around endothelial cells by using their endfeet to <b>hermetically-seal</b> the crevice between endothelial cells (Romero et al., 2003; Wolburg and Lippoldt, 2002). The soma of astrocytes extends out thick and short primary processes, which branch extensively in brain parenchyma, forming polarized terminal end feet to encase blood vessels. Perivascular astrocyte end feet, along with targeted endothelial cells of the cerebral blood vasculature, form waste-clearance channels between astrocytes and blood vessels, creating a glymphatic drainage system in brain.|$|R

The tomb remains unopened, possibly due to concerns over preservation of its artifacts.

Unlike early Raytheon transistors, which were sealed in a resin material, GE devices were housed in metal <b>hermetically-sealed</b> enclosures, removing oxygen and other potential contaminants to ensure reliability and long life, {{since many of}} the 2N43-45 transistors were used in military applications. Unlike most transistors sold in the 1950s that cost $10 or more, the 2N107's initial price was under $2.00; still {{a lot of money for}} the experimenter in the 1950s, but within reach.|$|E
50|$|The descent lander was a <b>hermetically-sealed</b> {{pressure}} vessel, {{which contained}} {{most of the}} instrumentation and electronics, mounted on a ring-shaped landing platform and topped by an antenna. The design {{was similar to the}} earlier Venera 9 - 12 landers. It carried instruments to take chemical and isotopic measurements, monitor the spectrum of scattered sunlight, and record electric discharges during its descent phase through the Venusian atmosphere. The spacecraft utilized a camera system, an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, a screw drill and surface sampler, a dynamic penetrometer, and a seismometer to conduct investigations on the surface.|$|E

It is armed with a front-mounted cannon, housed underneath a fold-away panel, and is also equipped with ejector seats and radar. The hydrogenic power unit can be removed and re-assembled as a personal jet pack, or other devices of comparable size (additional components for which are stored towards the back of the vehicle).|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, {{cranberry}} juice is commercially sterilized though thermal processing to eliminate any pathogenic or spoilage-causing microorganisms and spores. The prepared {{cranberry juice}} product is heat treated by high temperature-short time (HTST) or ultra-high temperature (UHT) techniques and packaged into aseptic, <b>hermetically-sealed</b> containers. During thermal processing, the cranberry juice receives a heat treatment time {{equivalent to a}} 5-log pathogen reduction. Often, the bacterium Clostridium botulinum is given special attention during thermal processing techniques of food. However, C. botulinum does not grow and produce toxins below a pH of 4.6 and cranberry juice is classified as a high-acid food with a pH of 2.3 to 2.9.|$|E
50|$|This {{method of}} {{production}} proved to be lucrative and was taken advantage of by many entrepreneurs needing only calves and seed lymph from an infected cow to manufacture crude versions of the vaccine. W. F. Elgin of the National Vaccine Establishment presented his slightly refined technique to the Conference of State and Provincial Boards of Health of North America. A tuberculosis-free calf, stomach shaved, would be bound to an operating table, where incisions would be made on its lower body. Glycerinated lymph from a previously inoculated calf was spread along the cuts. After a few days, the cuts would have scabbed or crusted over. The crust was softened with sterilized water and mixed with glycerin, which disinfected it, then stored <b>hermetically-sealed</b> in capillary tubes for later use.|$|E
50|$|Mackenzie informs Dr. Chamberlain of the {{presence}} of the terrorist, who is found, but attempts to remove him via a helicopter are unsuccessful because the train enters a tunnel. Chamberlain is also told that the plague has a 60% mortality rate. Mackenzie, however, informs passengers that police have received reports of anarchist bombs placed along the rail line, and that the train will be rerouted to Nuremberg. There the train is sealed with an enclosed oxygen system and a U.S. Army medical team is placed aboard, with the now-deceased terrorist being placed in a <b>hermetically-sealed</b> coffin. Dr. Chamberlain learns of the risk of the Cassandra Crossing. He also begins to suspect the disease is not as serious as originally thought: few of the passengers have become infected and few of those have actually died. He radios MacKenzie suggesting the infected portion of the train be uncoupled and isolated, but MacKenzie has no intention of stopping the train: if, as expected, the Cassandra Crossing collapses, it will neatly cover the fact that the U.S has been harbouring germ warfare agents in a neutral country. Passengers on the train work together to stop the train before it reaches the Cassandra Crossing.|$|E

5000|$|The A-3 Aerosledge has a hull {{built of}} riveted metal alloy {{construction}} using 2mm D-16T plates and profiles. The craft's ribs, stringers and plates are also of D-16 Duraluminium. Traverse bulkheads divide the craft into three watertight compartments. The craft will remain afloat with one flooded compartment. Double plating is employed for the hull bottom to strengthen it for crossing ice and snow. Low friction 3.5 mm polyethylene {{is attached to}} the bottom plates, which is removable for repair. Three stainless-steel runners are mounted to the hull base to provide the craft with the ability to maintain an even course, and prevent sideslipping on ice. The smooth lines of the hull's underside allow it to traverse bodies of water choked with weeds without difficulty. [...] Even with a maximum payload, the Aerosledge has a draft of no more than 2 inches. [...] The cabin is fully enclosed with a seating capacity of five in passenger configuration. In standard mail-carrying configuration, the cabin has one swiveling seat for the driver/mail carrier, and a cargo capacity of 1,433 lbs over ice, and 661 lbs over water. [...] Cabin access is by two gull-wing doors. There is an additional baggage storage compartment in front of the cabin, located beneath a <b>hermetically-sealed</b> hatch. The craft is controlled by a single wheel connected to twin rudders located behind the propeller. If the wheel is pulled towards the driver both rudders fold outward, forming a brake. If turned and pulled toward the driver, only one rudder folds outward, giving greater turning control over water overgrown with reeds or weeds. Three stainless steel runners mounted along the bottom of the hull provide additional stability while traveling over ice or snow. [...] When traversing snow, the slightly upturned bow of the A-3, together with the differences in pressure between the upper and lower surfaces of the hull, generate an aerodynamic lifting force. At speeds above 50 mph aerodynamic lift reduces the pressure exerted by the craft against the surface by one third. As the depth of the furrow decreases, friction resistance is reduced accordingly. On water the large area of the lower hull, with its small keel, makes it an ideal shallow-draft watercraft.|$|E

We {{evaluated}} <b>hermetically-sealed,</b> polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles for preserving wheat and maize flour against red flour beetle (RFB, Tribolium castaneum, Herbst) population growth. Flours infested with RFB and kept in sealed PET bottles experienced much less weight loss over a three-month storage period than infested flour kept in unsealed bottles. RFB populations in wheat flour kept in sealed bottles did not increase, while populations in unsealed bottles grew about 50 -fold during the same three-month period. Flour in sealed bottles had lower levels of oxygen and moisture than flour stored in unsealed bottles.

40|$|The reductive {{dechlorination}} of chlorinated phenols by vitamin B 12, {{supported by}} the reductant Ti(III) citrate, was examined. Procedures were developed, including a novel reactor system, for conducting these experiments. Most of {{the experiments were conducted}} in either <b>hermetically-sealed</b> glass ampoules, which could maintain vitamin B 12 in the fully-reduced vitamin B 12 s state for months, or in the novel two-chambered reactor (TCR), which could also support vitamin B 12 s for extended periods, and could easily be sampled to perform kinetic studies. Vitamin B 12 s reductively dechlorinates chlorinated phenols by nucleophilic aromatic substitution of the cobalamin for a chlorine, followed by reductive cleavage of the arylcobalamin to form the reductively-dechlorinated product. Dechlorination occurs chiefly at positions ortho to another chlorine, but the 2 and 6 positions are extremely recalcitrant, even when another chlorine is adjacent. The proposed mechanism accounts for the observed regiospecificity, consistent with bond charge density and thermodynamic considerations.

In reaction to the polemical publication of Peregrine Horden and Nicholas Purcell’s great study of Mediterranean history, The Corrupting Sea, in 2000, medieval historians in Europe and America have since formed research clusters and organized a huge number of conferences, all seeking to redirect the study of this complex region. Traditionally studied in region-specific and <b>hermetically-sealed</b> academic disciplines, ‘Mediterraneanism’ seeks to explore cultural interactions and interconnections between the peoples of the Mediterranean in an impartial and pan-regionalist way.

40|$|Because {{of their}} appreciable heat and {{acoustic}} insulating properties, insulated glass units (IGUs) are largely used in modern buildings to realize energetically efficient curtain walls. The typical insulated glass unit constitutes a multilayered glass combination, obtained by enclosing a <b>hermetically-sealed</b> air space between {{two or more}} glass panels. The deformations of the coupled system typically derive from external usual loads (e. g. wind loads) but also from internal loads (climatic loads), which depend {{on a series of}} not easily valuable factors (geometry of the element, temperature, pressure or altitude variations). In the practice, additional loading conditions could compromise their integrity, as for example the particular configurations depending on the deformability of the bearing structure or on the restrained thermal expansion. Because of these reasons, in this paper the results of a numerical investigation concerning the behavior of IGUs under many load conditions are presented. In particular, the buckling resistance of IGUs in compression is discussed, by proposing a simple analytical formulation for the estimation of their load carrying capacity...|$|E
40|$|There {{is great}} {{need for the}} {{widespread}} use of indoor gas monitors as modern <b>hermetically-sealed</b> domestic buildings increasingly suffer from indoor air pollution. However, neither modern technologies of gas sensors nor analytical instruments are ideally suited to this purpose. The problems of gas sensors are poor selectivity and the fact that normally they can detect only one gas, and analytical instruments suffer from their large size and high price. Therefore, the aim of the project is "to develop a novel gas sensor with low cost, low power consumption, high reliability, which can detect multiple gases with excellent selectivity" for indoor gas monitoring. In {{the first part of the}} project, an SOI-CMOS micro-hotplate with a single crystal silicon (SCS) resistive heater was proposed, fabricated and characterised. The design obviates issues of traditional heater materials i. e. platinum is not CMOS compatible and polysilicon is not thermally stable due to its polycrystalline structure.

DSC under nitrogen flow in open pans was chosen to analyze the enthalpy changes during the development of Maillard reaction in glucose-glycine model systems heated at 9 OC. While heating the glucose-glycine model system in the DSC open pans under dynamic nitrogen flow, the Maillard reaction was revealed by an endothermal enthalpy change beak I) occurring from IOOC to 15 OC, followed, on further heating, by a second endothermal peak (peak 2) from 200 C to 260 C. DSC traces of samples previously heated for up to 24 h showed a third endothermal peak @eak 3) in the temperature range from 9 OC to 170 C which was gradually detected while peak 2 tended to disappear.

40|$|In {{patients}} undergoing decompressive craniectomy, {{the bone}} flap is temporarily preserved {{either in the}} subcutaneous tissue of the patient or frozen. However, there are some drawbacks related to these methods. In 16 patients in whom the bone flap was removed for decompressive craniectomy, the bone was firstly washed in hydrogen peroxide and then placed in <b>hermetically-sealed</b> bags and sterilized using ethylene oxide. The bone was repositioned after an average period of 4. 3 months. One patient sustained an infection of the surgical wound which required permanent exclusion of the bone flap. In all the others, esthetic and functional results were good after an average follow-up of 20 months. Control CT-scan of the bone flap demonstrated preservation of its structural features with fusion of the bone margins and revitalization of the flap. On MRI a subdural space was again visible. Sterilization of the bone flap with ethylene oxide in patients undergoing decompressive craniectomy avoids some of the drawbacks related to the techniques currently used.

Because of the difficulties in storing the seeds, coffee germplasm is maintained in field collections, presenting significant problems, such as land and labor costs and susceptibility to environmental hazards and pathogens. Storage of Coffea species in ex situ genebanks may help to preserve the threatened diversity of this important genus. Since 1976 the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute has considered coffee as {{a high priority for}} genetic conservation. For non-orthodox seed species, cryopreservation is the only technique available for long-term germplasm conservation.

A more refractory foam called FOAMSID? 12 insulation has been developed for use in extremely corrosive environments at elevated temperatures. One such field of application, the Alcoa Smelting Process, involves the use of molten salts which tend to impregnate materials which are porous to either salt vapors or to the liquid phase.

40|$|Rotating disk {{electrodes}} (RDEs) {{are widely}} used in electrochemical characterization to analyze the mechanisms of various electrocatalytic reactions. RDE experiments often make use of or require collection and quantification of gaseous products. The combination of rotating parts and gaseous analytes makes the design of RDE cells that allow for headspace analysis challenging due to gas leaks at the interface of the cell body and the rotator. In this manuscript we describe a new, <b>hermetically-sealed</b> electrochemical cell that allows for electrode rotation while simultaneously providing a gastight environment. Electrode rotation in this new cell design is controlled by magnetically coupling the working electrode to a rotating magnetic driver. Calibration of the RDE using a tachometer shows that the rotation speed of the electrode {{is the same as}} that of the magnetic driver. To validate the performance of this cell for hydrodynamic measurements, limiting currents from the reduction of a potassium ferrocyanide (K_ 4 [Fe(CN) _ 6] • 3 H_ 2 O) were measured and shown to compare favorably with calculated values from the Levich equation and with data obtained using more typical, non-gastight RDE cells. Faradaic efficiencies of ~ 95 % were measured in the gas phase for oxygen evolution in alkaline media at an Inconel 625 alloy electrocatalyst during rotation at 1600 rpm.

40|$|Electronics {{capable of}} {{operation}} under extreme temperatures are required {{in many of}} NASA space exploration missions. Aerospace and military applications, {{as well as some}} terrestrial industries constitute environments where electronic systems are anticipated to be exposed to extreme temperatures and wide-range thermal swings. Electronics that are able to withstand and operate efficiently in such harsh environments would simplify, if not eliminate, traditional thermal control elements and their associated structures for proper ambient operation. As a result, overall system mass would be reduced, design would be simplified, and reliability would be improved. Electronic parts that are built utilizing silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology are known to offer better radiation-tolerance compared to their conventional silicon counterparts, provide faster switching, and consume less power. They also exhibit reduced leakage current and, thus, they are often tailored for high temperature operation. These attributes make SOI-based devices suitable for use in harsh environments where extreme temperatures and wide thermal swings are anticipated. A new operational amplifier, based on silicon-on-insulator technology and geared for high temperature well-logging applications, was recently introduced by Honeywell Corporation. This HTOP- 01 dual precision operational amplifier is a low power device, operates on a single supply, and has an internal oscillator and an external clocking option [1].

40|$|This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is {{intended}} for use in evaluating methods of phase abundance analysis of major phases in cement clinkers: the percentages of alite (C 3 S) 1, belite 2 (β-C 2 S), aluminate (C 3 A), ferrite (C 4 AF), and arcanite (K S). Each unit consists of three <b>hermetically-sealed</b> containers of approximately 10 g each of crushed portland cement clinker. The materials selected for SRMs 2686, 2687, and 2688 differ widely in phase abundance, crystal sizes, and distribution of crystals [1, 2]. Certified Values: The certified values for SRM 2687 expressed as mass fractions, are provided in Table 1. A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy, in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or accounted for by NIST. The certified values listed {{are based on the}} results of analyses performed at NIST using quantitative X-ray powder diffraction (QXRD) and from optical microscopy point count analyses conducted by both Construction Technology Laboratories, Inc. (CTL) 3 and ASTM C 1. 23 Microscopy Task Group (MPC) [3, 4]. The MPC analyses followed ASTM C 1356 M [5] and the QXRD used Reitveld refinement of powder diffraction data [6, 7]. Sampling for the X-ray study allowed assessment of within and between vial homogeneity and found the materials to be homogeneous. The uncertainty listed with each value is an expanded uncertainty, with coverage factor 2, calculated by combining a between-method variance [8, 9] with a pooled, within-method variance following th...|$|E
