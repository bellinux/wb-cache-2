40|$|BACKGROUND: Whether a {{perfusion}} defect {{exists in}} lacunar infarct {{and whether it}} is related to early neurological deterioration (END) is still under debate. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate whether END in lacunar infarct is related to a perfusion defect using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and perfusion MR imaging. METHODS: One hundred and forty-one consecutive patients had an MRI scan within 30 hours after onset of symptoms and 43 patients with acute lacunar infarct and classic lacunar syndrome were recruited. The MRI sequences included DWI, DTI and cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps to respectively represent the topographic locations of acute infarcts, the corticospinal tract and perfusion defects. The END was defined in reference to the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) as an increase ≧ 2 within 72 hours. Cohen's Kappa coefficient was used to examine the reliability between the 2 image readers. A multivariate logistic regression model was constructed adjusting for baseline variables. RESULTS: Ten out of the 43 patients had END. Patients having END was significantly associated with lower chances of favorable and good outcomes at 3 months (p =  0. 01 and p =  0. 002, respectively). END was predicted when the non-core hypoperfused area overlapped on the corticospinal tract, which is defined as the expected <b>END</b> <b>profile.</b> Cohen's Kappa coefficient between the 2 image readers to define images of expected END profiles was 0. 74. In 15 patients with expected <b>END</b> <b>profile,</b> 9 had END clinically, whereas 28 patients had no expected <b>END</b> <b>profile,</b> and only 1 patient had END (p< 0. 0001). After adjusting for sex, the expected <b>END</b> <b>profile</b> was still associated with END (odds ratio, 42. 2; p =  0. 002).

40|$|A novel {{secondary}} flow feature, previously unreported for turbine blading {{as far as}} the authors are aware, has been discovered. It has been found {{that it is possible to}} separate part of the inlet boundary layer on the blade row end wall as it is being over-turned and rolled up into the passage vortex. This flow feature has been discovered during a continuing investigation into the aerodynamic effects of non-axisymmetric <b>end</b> wall <b>profiling.</b> Previous work, using the low speed linear cascade at Durham University, has shown the potential of <b>end</b> wall <b>profiling</b> for reducing secondary losses. The latest study, the results of which are described here, was undertaken to determine the limits of what <b>end</b> wall <b>profiling</b> can achieve. The flow has been investigated in detail with pressure probe traversing and surface flow visualization. This has found that the inlet boundary locally separates, on the early suction side of the passage, generating significant extra loss which feeds directly into the core of the passage vortex. The presence of this new feature gives rise to the unexpected result that the {{secondary flow}}, as determined by the exit flow angle deviations and levels of secondary kinetic energy, can be reduced while at the same time the loss is increased. CFD was found to calculate the secondary flows moderately well compared with measurements. However, CFD did not predict this new feature, nor the increase in loss it caused. It is concluded that the application of non-axisymmetric <b>end</b> wall <b>profiling,</b> although it has been shown to be highly beneficial, can give rise to adverse features that current CFD tools are unable to predict. Improvements to CFD capability are required in order to be able to avoid such features, and obtain the full potential of <b>end</b> wall <b>profiling...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Pedestrians are {{vulnerable}} road users {{who are at}} high risks in a road traffic collision with motor vehicles. A large number are getting killed in traffic accidents each year, {{the majority of them}} being children and senior citizens. During impact with an automobile, pedestrians suffer multiple impacts with the bumper, hood and windscreen. Fatality is seen mostly due to the head injuries obtained by the pedestrians. Thus this paper aims to introduce the development and validation of a simplified hybrid vehicle front <b>end</b> <b>profile</b> for the mitigation of head injury. The vehicle model is represented by a multi body windscreen and finite element cowl, hood and bumper. A two step validation procedure is performed, firstly the crash kinematics validation to determine the overall kinematics and fall pattern of the pedestrian during impact. Secondly, the hybrid vehicle model is tested against the pedestrian injury criteria values for pertinent body parts namely the neck, sternum, lumbar, femur and tibia. The hybrid vehicle model is made to impact an adult human dummy model obtained from TNO (TASS Netherlands). The injury criterias are reprensented through the Head Injury Criteria (HIC), neck compression force, sternum and tibia accelerations and lumbar and femur bending moments. The simulation results were compared to the experimental values and a good correlation was achieved...|$|E

40|$|The {{excellent}} insulation {{properties of}} compressed Sulphur Hexaflouride are {{adversely affected by}} metallic particle contamination in practical gas insulated systems. The movement of such particles is random and the particles {{play a crucial role}} in determining the insulation behavior of GIS. A Three-phase enclosure-type gas insulated bus (GIB) has widely been applied to minimize the installation space of a substation. To determine the particle trajectories in a three-phase common enclosure Gas Insulated Bus duct (GIB) an outer enclosure of diameter 500 mm and inner conductors of diameters 64 mm spaced equilaterally are considered. Aluminum, copper and silver particles were considered to be present on enclosure surface. In order to determine the random behavior of moving particles, the calculation of movement in axial and radial directions was carried at every time step using rectangular random numbers. Simulation of Particle Movement with Reduced Phase Conductor is also carried out with a view to obtain optimum size of conductor for reliable operation by reducing the original diameter of the conductor from 64 mm to 54 mm in steps of 5 mm. At each reduced diameter the particle movement is calculated at each instant in both radial and axial directions using Monte Carlo Technique. Monte Carlo simulation is also carried out by changing the random solid angle from 1 degree to 0. 5 degrees. The random solid angle is decreased to 0. 5 degrees to take into account more smooth <b>end</b> <b>profile</b> of the particle.
