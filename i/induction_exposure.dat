40|$|Abstract Background Craving {{for alcohol}} {{is a highly}} {{controversial}} subjective construct and may be clarified by Loewenstein's visceral theory, which emphasizes craving's behavioral effects on the relative value of alcohol. Based on the visceral theory, {{this study examined the}} effects of a craving induction on the relative value of alcohol as measured by a behavioral choice task. In addition, based on previous evidence of its role in the expression of craving, the influence of DRD 4 VNTR genotype (DRD 4 -L vs. DRD 4 -S) was also examined. Methods Thirty-five heavy drinkers (54 % male; 31 % DRD 4 -L) were randomly assigned to receive either a craving <b>induction</b> (<b>exposure</b> to personally relevant alcohol cues) or a control <b>induction</b> (<b>exposure</b> to neutral cues), which was followed by an alcohol-money choice task. Participants were assessed for craving and positive/negative affect throughout the procedure, and relative value of alcohol was derived from participant choices for alcohol versus money. DRD 4 VNTR status was assessed retrospectively via buccal samples using previously established protocols. Results Factorial analysis of the craving induction revealed that it was associated with significant increase in craving (p p p Conclusion These results are interpreted as generally supporting Loewenstein's visceral theory of craving and evidence of a functional role of DRD 4 VNTR genotype in the expression of craving for alcohol.

40|$|Relationships between {{activities}} of delta-aminolevulinate synthase and heme oxygenase, respectively the rate-limiting enzymes of heme biosynthesis and degradation, {{have been studied}} in chick embryo liver cell cultures following exposure of the cultures to glutethimide and iron, a combination known to produce a synergistic induction of both enzymes. In time-course experiments, synergistic induction of heme oxygenase activity by glutethimide and iron preceded that of delta-aminolevulinate synthase by 4 h. Effects of selective inhibitors of both heme synthesis and degradation have also been studied with respect to effects on delta-aminolevulinate synthase and heme oxygenase activities. The synergistic induction of heme oxygenase by glutethimide and iron appears to be dependent upon cellular heme synthesis because addition of inhibitors of heme biosynthesis, 4, 6 -dioxoheptanoic acid or N-methyl-mesoporphyrin abolishes this synergistic <b>induction.</b> <b>Exposure</b> of cultures to tin-mesoporphyrin, a potent inhibitor of heme oxygenase, prevented the synergistic induction of delta-aminolevulinate synthase produced by glutethimide and iron, or, when added after induction was already established, promptly halted any further induction.

40|$|Biotransformation of {{xenobiotics}} in fish occurs {{by many of}} {{the same}} reactions as in mammals. These reactions have been shown to affect the bioaccumulation, persistence, residue dynamics, and toxicity of select chemicals in fish. P 450 -dependent monooxygenase activity of fish can be induced by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, but phenobarbital-type agents induce poorly, if at all. Fish monooxygenase activity exhibits ideal temperature compensation and sex-related variation. Induction of monooxygenase activity by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons can result in qualitative as well as quantitative changes in the metabolic profile of a chemical. Induction can also alter toxicity. In addition, multiple P- 450 isozymes have been described for several fish species. The biotransformation products of certain chemicals have been related to specific P- 450 isozymes, and the formation of these products can be influenced by <b>induction.</b> <b>Exposure</b> of fish to low levels of certain environmental contaminants has resulted in induction of specific monooxygenase activities and monitoring of such activities has been suggested as a means of identifying areas of pollutant exposure in the wild.

40|$|Abstract of Poster PreseantationJournal URL: [URL] AtoS-AtoC two-component {{system in}} E. coli {{consists}} of the membrane bound AtoS sensor kinase and the AtoC response regulator. Upon acetoacetate-mediated induction, AtoS autophosporylates and consequently phosphorylates, thereby activating, AtoC. AtoC regulates positively the transcriptional activation of atoDAEB operon, encoding for enzymes involved in short-chain fatty acid catabolism. AtoS-AtoC system acting on its target atoDAEB operon regulates the biosynthesis and the intracellular distribution of short-chain poly-(R) - 3 -hydroxybutyrate (cPHB), a biopolymer with many physiological roles in E. coli, under acetoacetate or spermidine induction. The extrachromosomal introduction of the atoSC locus and the atoDAEB operon in Dato- DAEB strain increases cPHB levels {{in the presence of}} the inducers. Enhancement of cPHB is also achieved by the AtoS-AtoC system in the absence of its target operon. DatoDAEB cells overproducing the AtoS kinase accumulate only the basal cPHB levels independently to the presence of acetoacetate or spermidine. However, AtoC up-regulates cPHB in the absence of atoDAEB operon upon <b>induction.</b> <b>Exposure</b> of DatoDAEB cells which overproduce the AtoS-AtoC system or only AtoC to cerulenin or acrylic acid, results to reduction of cPHB levels. Cerulenin, the inhibitor of fatty acids biosynthesis pathway, caused the more pronounced down-regulation of cPHB. These data suggest that in the absence of atoDAEB operon, AtoC possibly regulates cPHB biosynthesis through the fatty acid metabolism pathways, with the biosynthesis being the most potent mechanism.

40|$|The {{localization}} {{of memory}} T cells to human skin {{is essential for}} long-term immune surveillance {{and the maintenance of}} barrier integrity. The expression of CCR 8 during naive T cell activation is controlled by skin-specific factors derived from epidermal ker-atinocytes and not by resident dendritic cells. In this study, we show that the CCR 8 -inducing factors are heat stable and protease resistant and include the vitamin D 3 metabolite 1 a, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 and PGE 2. The effect of either metabolite alone on CCR 8 expression was weak, whereas their combination resulted in robust CCR 8 expression. Elevation of intracellular cAMP was essential because PGE 2 could be substituted with the adenylyl cyclase agonist forskolin, and CCR 8 expression was sensitive to protein kinase A inhibition. For effective <b>induction,</b> <b>exposure</b> of naive T cells to these epidermal factors needed to occur either prior to or during T cell activation even though CCR 8 was only detected 4 – 5 d later in proliferating T cells.

40|$|Previous {{experiments}} {{have demonstrated that}} double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) can exert an antiproliferative effect on human tumor cells, independent of interferon (IFN) induction. However, the mechanism by which dsRNAs inhibit tumor growth has not been elucidated. As {{a first step in}} determining the molecular events responsible for growth arrest, we have explored the role of signal transduction through the cAMP system in the antiproliferative effect of the mismatched dsRNA, r(I) n. r(C 12,U) n (Ampligen). These studies utilized the human glioma cell line A 1235, which does not produce detectable levels of IFN-alpha, -beta, or -gamma in response to mismatched dsRNA treatment. Treatment of A 1235 cells with mismatched dsRNA in combination with either 1 -(5 -isoquinolinesulfonyl) - 2 -methylpiperazine (H- 7), which inhibits cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C, or N-(2 -guanidinoethyl) - 5 -isoquinolinesulfonamide (HA 1004), which preferentially inhibits the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, yielded an antagonism of the mismatched dsRNA-induced antiproliferative effect. Measurement of adenylate cyclase activation showed a dose-dependent increase in activity at antiproliferative mismatched dsRNA concentrations, but not at lower, nonantiproliferative doses. This increase in activity was rapid, seen as early as 30 sec after initiation of treatment, and it was sustained at peak levels for 1 - 2 hr. Analysis of the intracellular cAMP concentration gave similar kinetics of <b>induction.</b> <b>Exposure</b> of cells to the stable cAMP analogue dibutyryl cAMP yielded dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth. The cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine also inhibited proliferation. In contrast, neither H- 7 nor HA 1004 had an effect on growth inhibition induced by human natural IFN-alpha treatment. In addition, antiproliferative doses of IFN-alpha did not increase cAMP concentrations. These results indicate that the cAMP system is utilized by mismatched dsRNA as an early signal transduction mechanism for growth control. Furthermore, the antiproliferative effects induced by mismatched dsRNA and IFN can occur by different mechanisms of action...|$|E

40|$|During the First World War, {{approximately}} two million troops {{served with the}} American Expeditionary Forces (AEF), the army that functioned as the material and symbolic focal point of America's commitment to {{the defeat of the}} Central Powers. This dissertation examines the impact of training, active service and combat on the social identity of the draftees and volunteers who comprised the AEF. Reigning historiography has generally minimized the importance of those experiences as factors in the formation of distinct socio-cultural allegiances among American participants of the Great War. Instead, it has stressed the historical context of Progressive-Era reforms as the key to understanding the development of corporate identity among American soldiers in the years 1917 - 1919. This body of scholarship maintains that soldiers interpreted the meaning of their war service, and evaluated their relationship {{with each other and with}} the mainstream of American civil society, through the prism of the Progressive rhetoric of social engineering, national rejuvenation, and moral "uplift" to which they had been exposed from the moment of their <b>induction.</b> <b>Exposure</b> to the optimistic slogans of Progressive reform, coupled with the brevity of America's active involvement in the conflict, assured that American soldiers would emerge from the war with a heightened appreciation of American socio-political institutions, culture, and moral norms. 	This dissertation offers an alternative interpretation of the impact of the Great War on the collective and individual identities of its American participants. Using letters, diaries, and memoirs penned by enlisted soldiers and junior officers, it asserts the primacy of the war experience in shaping the socio-cultural allegiances of ordinary "Doughboys. " Immersion in the organizational milieu of the military, followed by overseas deployment, active service in France, and combat on the Western Front, represented a radical break with civilian forms of identity soldiers professed prior to the war. It was the sum of these life-changing experiences, rather than the Progressive indoctrination they received in the training camps, that shaped soldiers' views of their relationship with each other and to the nation back home. Under the influence of these experiences, soldiers became members of an alternative social order whose values and worldviews frequently clashed with the attitudes and norms they associated with the American home front. Convinced they belonged to a closed community whose unique experiences had set them apart from the American mainstream, Doughboys emerged from the war with a collective mentality that dwelled on the fundamental differences, rather than the similarities, between those who had fought "over there" from those who remained "over here.

40|$|All organisms studied so far {{respond to}} heat shock by {{inducing}} {{the synthesis of}} a number of proteins called heat shock proteins(LISPs). This universal response can also be induced by a variety of stressors, including heavy metal ions and organic and organo-metallic compounds. As a result, the stress response has recently attracted the attention of ecotoxicologists for use in environmental biomonitoring. In the present study, we have investigated the stress responses of two different organisms; namely the free-living soil nematode Caenorhiabdities elegans(both wild-type and transgenic strains) and the freshwater crustacea Asellus aquazicus. We have also explored the possible use of these model systems in environmental monitoring using different techniques which include metabolic labelling with subsequent one-dimensional electrophoresis and autoradiography, and one- or two-dimensional western blotting using antibodies specific to stress protein 70. The study with A. aquaticus shows that this organism exhibits a classical stress response. The exposure of asellids to heat shock-treatment (26 °C; 13 °C above the standard maintenance temperature) or to sublethal concentrations of metal ions (Cd++ and Cu++) resulted in the induction of at least 5 putative HSPs which belong to several major HSP families (HSP 100, HSP 90 and possibly HSP 60). An increase in the synthesis of smaller sizes of polypeptides (25 - 35 kD) should be also noted. Moreover, the time-course of heat versus heavy metal stress-response in this organism suggests that the pattern of stress-protein synthesis changes considerably with increasing exposure time; notably the response to heat is more transient than that to heavy metals. However, HSP 70 {{does not appear to be}} the major stress protein induced in this organism. The presence of low molecular weight (LMW) proteins which react with anti-HSP 70 antibodies and the apparent deficiency of classical 70 kD stress proteins in A. aquaticus, both suggest that HSP 70 s in this organism are for some reason prone to degradation. In the nematode C. elegans, shifting the culture temperature from 20 °C to 34 °C induces the synthesis of a set of HSPs corresponding to the HSP 90, HSP 70 and small HSP families. There are at least nine members of the hsp 7 O multigene family in C. elegans; some members are expressed constitutively while others are stress inducible. W e have studied the effects of heat and heavy metal (cadmium) stress on the expression patterns of the HSP 70 protein family in the nematodes by one- and two-dimensional Western blotting using a monoclonal anti-HSP 70 antibody that recognises a conserved epitope shared by most HSP 70 family members. Constitutive C. elegans HSP 70 s (expressed at 20 °C) are almost undetectable on one-dimensional immunoblots, but chemiluminescent probing of two-dimensional blots reveals a complex pattern of several HSP 70 s pots. Mild heats hock at 31 ° C induces a doublet HSP 70 band on one-dimensional blots, of which the heavier component (75 kD) is more prominent than the lighter (73 kD). On two-dimensional blots, this pattern is shown to be more complex with a prominent 75 kD spot newly induced and several other spots intensified. Severe heat shock at 34 °C strongly induces both 75 and 73 kD bands on one-dimensional blots; two dimensional analysis reveals a series of novel and/or elevated 73 and 75 kD spots. Treatment with cadmium(16 ppm) at 31 ° C gives a different pattern of spots as compared with 31 °C alone; several spots show enhanced while some are newly expressed, and not all of these are present at 34 °C. These results indicate that related members of the HSP 70 protein family in C. elegans are independently regulated in response to different forms of stress. The possible significance of these findings is discussed in relation to the possible use of stress responses s environmental biomonitors. We have also utilised a stress-inducible C. elegans strain (CB 4027) for monitoring environmental contamination. This transgenic strain carries integrated copies of the Drosophila hsp 70 promoter fused to an E. coli lacZ reporter gene. When exposed to heat shock or to several environmentally relevant stressors, the transgenic strain expresses the reporter product, 3 -galactosidase, which can easily be quantified or localised in situ in stained worms or on Western blots (apparently enzymatically active as a 170 kD form). We have exposed transgenic worms to a variety of toxicants at an elevated temperature (32 °C) just below that required for heat shock (34 °C), in order to obtain optimal transgene <b>induction.</b> <b>Exposure</b> of nematodes to several heavy metals (e. g. Cd+, Hg++, Zn+, Sn++, Mn++ and Ag+), organometallic toxicants (tributyltin) or organic pollutants (lindane) induces ß-galactosidase expression in a dose-dependent manner. Cadmium is found to be by far the strongest inducer of transgene activity amongst the agents tested, although tributyltin is an effective inducer at ppb levels. The effects of mixtures of divalent metal ions (Cd++/Ca++, Cd++/Zn++ and Cd++/Hg++) on ß-galactosidase expression have been also investigated. All three divalent ions tested in combination with cadmium significantly inhibit cadmium-induced transgene activity in comparison to cadmium alone. In the case of Cd++/C++ mixtures, a marked inhibition of Cd++ accumulation by worm tissues has also been demonstrated, directly related to the Ca++ concentration. These effects may represent competition for metal-ion uptake through calcium channels. Our results show that this transgenic system works well within strictly defined assay conditions, and can detect clear responses over a 7 h exposure period to environmentally relevant toxicants at sublethal concentrations well below the 24 or 48 h LCSO values. However, there is a need for careful characterisation and containment of any transgenic organism if it is to be used as environmental monitoring tool...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{effect of}} natural {{background}} radiation on Cancer is still challenging. The investigation of association between external gamma rays and Cancer {{was the main}} goal of study. Materials 2 ̆ 6 Methods: External Gamma rays were measured using a radiation survey meter in 184 urban and rural health centers to estimate the exposure to the population in residential areas of Babol. The dose distribution map was compared to the 5 years radiation induced cancer incidence data from cancer registry center in north part of Iran. Results: Results showed that although the external gamma ray level in Babol is nearly equal to the average natural background radiation in the world, there is a relatively weak inverse association between local external gamma ray and incidence of Cancer [Correlation coefficient = – 0. 43, (p 3 ̆c 0. 01) ]. Conclusion: This finding {{might be due to}} the inhibition of cancer <b>induction</b> following <b>exposure</b> to the low doses of ionizing radiation and probably can be a confirmation of radiation hormesis. However, due to some uncertainties, the conclusion should be interpreted with caution. Further national and international studies are suggested...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the effects}} of high dose {{radiation}} on human cells and tissues are relatively well defined, {{there is no consensus}} regarding {{the effects of}} low and very low radiation doses on the organism. Ionizing radiation has been shown to induce gene mutations and chromosome aberrations which are known {{to be involved in the}} process of carcinogenesis. The induction of secondary cancers is a challenging long-term side effect in oncologic patients treated with radiation. Medical sources of radiation like intensity modulated radiotherapy used in cancer treatment and computed tomography used in diagnostics, deliver very low doses of radiation to large volumes of healthy tissue, which might contribute to increased cancer rates in long surviving patients and in the general population. Research shows that because of the phenomena characteristic for low dose radiation the risk of cancer <b>induction</b> from <b>exposure</b> of healthy tissues to low dose radiation can be greater than the risk calculated from linear no-threshold model. Epidemiological data collected from radiation workers and atomic bomb survivors confirms that exposure to low dose radiation can contribute to increased cancer risk and also that the risk might correlate with the age at exposure...|$|R
40|$|The chemopreventive isothiocyanate sulforaphane, {{which is}} derived from broccoli, was shown to induce a mitotic cell cycle arrest in the human colon cancer cell line 40 - 16. This arrest was {{followed}} by mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. Sulforaphane potently inhibited NF-B activation upstream of its nuclear translocation and decreased {{the expression of a}} series of anti-apoptotic, NF-B-dependent genes, which supposedly facilitated apoptosis <b>induction.</b> Transient <b>exposure</b> of 40 - 16 cells to sulforaphane for up to 6 h resulted in reversible G 2 /M cell cycle arrest and cytostatic growth inhibition, whereas a minimum continuous exposure time of 12 h was necessary for sulforaphane to irreversibly arrest cells in G 2 /M and subsequently induce apoptosis. Low concentrations of sulforaphane caused a transient decrease in cytoplasmic glutathione levels followed by glutathione induction after 24 h. However, depletion of glutathione did not seem to play a role for sulforaphane-induced apoptosis. Combination effects of sulforaphane and 3, 3 ’-diindolylmethane were investigated in terms of cell growth inhibition in the 40 - 16 cell line. Sulforaphane and 3, 3 ’-diindolylmethane inhibited cell proliferation antagonistically at low concentrations, but synergistically at cytotoxic concentrations...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} aims to assess {{contaminant}} levels and tissue burdens in hooded seal (Cystophora cristata) blubber, liver, and blood {{in association with}} cytochrome P 450 (CYP) enzymes (CYP 1 A and - 3 A) and serum analytes (hepatic enzymes like alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase [AP], and gamma-glutamyltransferase [GGT], serum proteins, and creatine kinase). Contaminant accumulation levels and patterns of polychlorinated biphenyls, chlorinated pesticides, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) differed between tissues and seal groups, with the highest levels in liver. Pups showed higher liver contaminant levels, especially for PBDEs, than adults. These high levels might {{be associated with the}} ingestion of large amounts of contaminated milk and subsequent accumulation in the liver. Adult males and females mainly differed in PBDE levels, which were higher in females, possibly due to a sex-specific diet. The association between blubber contaminant burdens and the diagnostic enzymes ALT, GGT, and AP, and serum albumin, was inconclusive. In contrast, several CYP isoenzymes showed a clear positive relationship with the overall blubber contaminant burden, indicating enzyme <b>induction</b> following <b>exposure</b> to polyhalogenated hydrocarbons. Therefore, liver CYP isoenzymes may serve as a sensitive biomarker for long-term exposure to polyhalogenated hydrocarbons...|$|R
40|$|The groESL operon {{is under}} complex {{regulation}} in Caulobacter crescentus. In addition to strong <b>induction</b> after <b>exposure</b> to heat shock, under physiological growth conditions, its expression {{is subject to}} cell cycle control. Transcription and translation of the groE genes occur primarily in predivisional cells, with very low levels of expression in stalked cells. The regulatory region of groESL contains both a ς 32 -like promoter and a CIRCE element. Overexpression of C. crescentus ς 32 gives rise {{to higher levels of}} GroEL and increased levels of the groESL transcript coming from the ς 32 -like promoter. Site-directed mutagenesis in CIRCE has indicated a negative role for this cis-acting element in the expression of groESL only at normal growth temperatures, with a minor effect on heat shock induction. Furthermore, groESL-lacZ transcription fusions carrying mutations in CIRCE are no longer cell cycle regulated. Analysis of an hrcA null strain, carrying a disruption in the gene encoding the putative repressor that binds to the CIRCE element, shows constitutive synthesis of GroEL throughout the Caulobacter cell cycle. These results indicate a negative role for the hrcA gene product and the CIRCE element in the temporal control of the groESL operon...|$|R
5000|$|Even {{when not}} coupled with [...] "touching", sounds {{can be highly}} sexually arousing. Commercial erotic {{material}} (mainly produced for the male market) uses such sounds extensively. As early as the 1920s and 30s, several genres of singers turned to [...] "low moans" [...] for erotic effect. Vaudeville Jazz singers often incorporated sex sounds into the narrative of the lyrics. Even contemporary music such as Prince's [...] "Orgasm" [...] or Marvin Gaye's [...] "You Sure Love to Ball" [...] includes sounds of the female orgasm. Research has shown music to be an auditory sexual stimulant. In one mood <b>induction</b> study, <b>exposure</b> to certain music resulted in significantly greater penile tumescence and subjective sexual arousal for men. In a similar experiment, women did not show significant physiological responses to certain types of music but did {{reported higher levels of}} sexual arousal. Further studies have looked at the connection between auditory stimulation and the experience of sexual pleasure. Whilst the highest levels of physiological and subjective arousal were found for visual stimuli, spoken-text was found to elicit sexual arousal in men implicating sounds a means for sexual stimulation.|$|R
30|$|The {{underlying}} mechanism(s) of {{in utero}} SHS-induced alterations in airway physiology {{is yet to}} be studied and may involve proteostasis-mediated modulation of surfactant proteins, NFκB and growth factors. Specifically, SHS is known to induce NFκB levels by regulating proteasomal degradation of its endogenous inhibitor, IκB [21], which is anticipated as the potential mechanism for NFκB induction in BPD, similar to its role in other diseases states such as COPD, cystic fibrosis (CF), etc. In BPD, NFκB is also known to inhibit expression of fibroblast growth factor (FGF- 10) that is essential for branching and morphogenesis of the conducting airways of the lungs [22]. NFκB <b>induction,</b> via SHS <b>exposure,</b> can reduce FGF- 10 expression in preterm infants promoting initiation of BPD [23].|$|R
40|$|Certain {{hexavalent}} chromium [Cr(VI) ] compounds are implicated as occupational respiratory carcinogens. Cr(VI) induces {{a broad spectrum}} of DNA damage, but Cr(VI) -induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) have not been reported. Previously we found that Cr(VI) activ-ates the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase. ATM is activated specifically in response to DSBs. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} investigate DSB <b>induction</b> by Cr(VI) <b>exposure</b> with the overarching hypothesis that S phase-dependent DSBs are produced by Cr(VI) exposure. To test this hypothesis, normal human fibroblasts were treated with either Cr(VI) or neocarzinostatin (NCS). DSBs were analyzed by both comet assay under neutral conditions, which detects primarily DNA DSBs, and phos-phorylation of histone H 2 AX (g-H 2 AX) and the resultan...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Risk {{assessment}} of radiation exposure during long-term space missions requires {{the knowledge of}} the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of space radiation components. Few data on gene transcription activation by different heavy ions are available, suggesting a dependence on linear energy transfer. The transcription factor Nuclear Factor κB (NF-κB) can be involved in cancerogenesis. Therefore, NF-κB activation by accelerated heavy ions of different linear energy transfer (LET) was correlated to survival. Materials and methods: NF-κB-dependent gene <b>induction</b> after <b>exposure</b> to heavy ions was detected in stably transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK-pNF-κB-d 2 EGFP/Neo cells carrying a neomycin resistance), using the destabilized Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (d 2 EGFP) as reporter. Results: Argon (LET 272 keV/μm) and neon ions (LET 91 keV/μm) had the highest potential to activate NF-κB, resulting in a RBE of 8. 9 in comparison to 150 kV X-rays. The RBE for survival also reached its maximum in this LET range, with a maximal value of 2. Conclusions: NF-κB might be involved in modulating survival responses of cells hit by heavy ions in the LET range of 91 – 272 keV/μm and could therefore become a factor to be considered for risk {{assessment of}} radiation exposure during space travel...|$|R
40|$|Heat shock {{proteins}} (Hsps) are robustly {{induced by}} diverse stressors that denature proteins. In addition to stress resistance, Hsps {{are involved in}} the folding of nascent proteins, plant and animal development, aging, environmental adaptation and the immune response, demonstrating the fundamental importance of these proteins to cell survival. Heat shock proteins are induced in aquatic organisms by perturbations of temperature and salinity, environmental contaminants, handling, hormones and biotic stressors. Exposure to sublethal stress may enhance tolerance to a subsequent stress, a process termed induced thermotolerance, and provide protection to stressors other than the initial stress, known as cross-tolerance. In the present review, we briefly describe the established approaches that are used to control disease during aquaculture. This is followed by documentation of Hsp <b>induction</b> after <b>exposure</b> to stressors commonly encountered by aquatic organisms. Induced thermotolerance, cross-tolerance and immune enhancement by Hsps are also considered. Although physiological stress is known to decrease disease resistance it is now becoming clear that stress-induced Hsps enhance the tolerance of aquatic organisms to disease. Potential applications for Hsps in the commercial production of fish, crustaceans and molluscs are indicated, an issue of significance when the importance of aquaculture in feeding the world's population is realized...|$|R
40|$|Activation of {{peroxisome}} proliferator-activated receptor ¿ (PPAR¿) by ligands {{is associated}} with beneficial health effects, including anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing effects. The aim {{of the current study}} was to develop luciferase reporter gene assays to enable fast and low-cost measurement of PPAR¿ agonist and antagonist activity. Two reporter gene assays, PPAR¿ 1 CALUX and PPAR¿ 2 CALUX, were developed by stable transfection of U 2 OS cells with an expression vector for PPAR¿ 1 or PPAR¿ 2 and a pGL 3 – 3 xPPRE–tata-luc or pGL 4 – 3 xPPRE–tata-luc reporter construct, respectively. PPAR¿ 1 CALUX and PPAR¿ 2 CALUX cells showed similar concentration-dependent luciferase <b>induction</b> upon <b>exposure</b> to the PPAR¿ agonists rosiglitazone, troglitazone, pioglitazone, ciglitazone, netoglitazone, and 15 -deoxy-¿ 12, 14 -prostaglandin J 2. The potency to induce luciferase decreased in the following order: rosiglitazone > troglitazone = pioglitazone > netoglitazone > ciglitazone. A concentration-dependent decrease in the response to 50 nM rosiglitazone was observed on the addition of PPAR¿ antagonist GW 9662 or T 0070907 in both PPAR¿ 1 CALUX and PPAR¿ 2 CALUX cells. The PPARa agonists WY 14643 and fenofibrate failed to induce luciferase activity, confirming the specificity of these cell lines for PPAR¿ agonists. In conclusion, PPAR¿ 1 CALUX and PPAR¿ 2 CALUX cells provide a reliable and useful tool to screen (bio) chemicals for PPAR¿ agonist or antagonist activity...|$|R
40|$|Hypoxic/ischemic episodes {{can trigger}} {{oxidative}} stress-mediated loss of central neurons via apoptosis, and low pO 2 {{is also a}} feature of the tumor microenvironment, where cancer cells are particularly resistant to apoptosis. In the CNS, ischemic insult increases expression of the CO-generating enzyme heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1), which is commonly constitutively active in cancer cells. It has been proposed that apoptosis can be regulated by the trafficking and activity of K+ channels, particularly Kv 2. 1. We have explored the idea that HO- 1 may influence apoptosis via regulation of Kv 2. 1. Overexpression of Kv 2. 1 in HEK 293 cells increased their vulnerability to oxidant-induced apoptosis. CO (applied as the donor CORM- 2) protected cells against apoptosis and inhibited Kv 2. 1 channels. Similarly in hippocampal neurones, CO selectively inhibited Kv 2. 1 and protected neurones against oxidant-induced apoptosis. In medulloblastoma sections we identified constitutive expression of HO- 1 and Kv 2. 1, and in the medulloblastoma-derived cell line DAOY, hypoxic HO- 1 <b>induction</b> or <b>exposure</b> to CO protected cells against apoptosis, and also selectively inhibited Kv 2. 1 channels expressed in these cells. These studies are consistent with a central role for Kv 2. 1 in apoptosis in both central neurones and cancer cells. They also suggest that HO- 1 expression can strongly influence apoptosis via CO-mediated regulation of Kv 2. 1 activity...|$|R
