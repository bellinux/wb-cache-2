5|$|The book is an {{extensive}} work of investigative journalism, {{written in the}} form of an encompassing time line; the events that shaped the epidemic are presented as sequential matter-of-fact summaries. Shilts describes the impact and the politics involved in battling the disease on particular individuals in the gay, medical, and political communities. Shilts begins <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> in 1977 with the first confirmed case of AIDS, that of Grethe Rask, a Danish doctor working in Africa. He ends with the announcement by actor Rock Hudson in 1985 that he was dying of AIDS, when international attention on the disease exploded.|$|E

25|$|One of Carr's most lasting {{contributions}} to modern-day conspiracy theory was <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> of an alleged plan for three world wars (often referred as the 3WW), which he believed {{was developed by}} Confederate general and Masonic scholar Albert Pike.|$|E
25|$|Rashi, {{while his}} {{commentary}} on the verses describing the days of creation teaches them as literal days, brackets <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> of Genesis ch. 1 with comments stating that the entire world was created at once, with no duration of existence before Adam being specified.|$|E
25|$|Logical {{notions of}} higher order: While Tarski {{confined}} <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> to operations of first-order logic, {{there is nothing}} about his proposal that necessarily restricts it to first-order logic. (Tarski likely restricted his attention to first-order notions as the talk was given to a non-technical audience.) So, higher-order quantifiers and predicates are admitted as well.|$|E

25|$|Russell Doolittle: Doolittle, upon whom Behe based much of <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> {{of blood}} clotting, {{described}} it as misrepresenting a simplified explanation he had given in a lecture, and presenting a fallacious creationist miscalculation of improbability by omitting known options, which {{also contributed to the}} original publisher turning down the book for publication.|$|E
25|$|Bultmann's {{analysis}} is still widely applied in German-speaking countries, although with many corrections and discussions. Wide-ranging replies {{have been made}} to this analysis. Today, most Christian exegetes reject much of Bultmann's theory, but accept certain of his intuitions. For instance, J. Blank uses Bultmann in <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> of the Last Judgment and W. Thüsing uses him to discuss the elevation and glorification of Jesus.|$|E
25|$|Pāṇini (c. 5th century BC) {{formulated}} {{the rules}} for Sanskrit grammar. His notation was similar to modern mathematical notation, and used metarules, transformations, and recursion. Pingala (roughly 3rd–1st centuries BC) in his treatise of prosody uses a device corresponding to a binary numeral system. <b>His</b> <b>discussion</b> of the combinatorics of meters corresponds to an elementary version of the binomial theorem. Pingala's work also contains the basic ideas of Fibonacci numbers (called mātrāmeru).|$|E

25|$|According to Human Rights Watch {{annual report}} 2016, Saudi Arabia {{continued}} to prosecute pro-reform activists and dissidents. Saudi Arabia's terrorism court sentenced Waleed Abu al-Khair, prominent activist, to 15 years. He was convicted on charges concerning his peaceful {{criticism of the}} human rights situation in his country. In July, authorities arrested Zuhair Kutbi, an activist, because of <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> to a peaceful reform in media. In September 2015, all of banned –Saudi Civil Political Rights Association (ACPRA) founders were jailed.|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} of Lectio Divina, {{a form of}} prayer that centers on scripture reading, was developed in its best-known form in the sixth century, through the work of Benedict of Nursia and Pope Gregory I, and described and promoted more widely in the 12th century by Guigo II. The 9th century saw the development of mystical theology through {{the introduction of the}} works of sixth-century theologian Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, such as On Mystical Theology. <b>His</b> <b>discussion</b> of the via negativa was especially influential.|$|E
25|$|Freud had greatly {{admired his}} {{philosophy}} tutor, Brentano, {{who was known}} for his theories of perception and introspection, as well as Theodor Lipps {{who was one of the}} main contemporary theorists of the concepts of the unconscious and empathy. Brentano discussed the possible existence of the unconscious mind in his Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint (1874). Although Brentano denied its existence, <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> of the unconscious probably helped introduce Freud to the concept. Freud owned and made use of Charles Darwin's major evolutionary writings, and was also influenced by Eduard von Hartmann's Philosophy of the Unconscious (1869).|$|E
2500|$|In <b>his</b> <b>discussions</b> of {{rational}} psychology, Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) identified the soul as the [...] "I" [...] in the strictest sense, {{and argued that}} the existence of inner experience can neither be proved nor disproved.|$|R

25|$|Disenchanted with French {{academic}} life, Ricœur taught {{briefly at}} the Université catholique de Louvain in Belgium, before taking a position at the Divinity School of the University of Chicago, where he taught from 1970 to 1985. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1971. His study culminated in The Rule of Metaphor: Multi-Disciplinary Studies of the Creation of Meaning in Language published in 1975 and the three-volume Time and Narrative published in 1983, 1984, 1985 Ricœur gave the Gifford Lectures in 1985/86, published in 1990 as Oneself as Another. This work built on <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> of narrative identity and his continuing interest in the self.|$|E
25|$|Lévi's Baphomet is {{the source}} of the later Tarot image of the Devil in the Rider-Waite design. The concept of a downward-pointing pentagram on its {{forehead}} was enlarged upon by Lévi in <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> (without illustration) of the Goat of Mendes arranged within such a pentagram, which he contrasted with the microcosmic man arranged within a similar but upright pentagram. The actual image of a goat in a downward-pointing pentagram first appeared in the 1897 book La Clef de la Magie Noire by Stanislas de Guaita. It was this image that was later adopted as the official symbol—called the Sigil of Baphomet—of the Church of Satan, and continues to be used among Satanists.|$|E
25|$|In this chapter, Innis {{outlines}} {{the history of}} the world's first civilizations in Mesopotamia. He starts with the fertile plains between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, but as the history unfolds, <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> extends to large parts of the modern Middle East. Biographer Paul Heyer's warning that Innis's work can be challenging applies to this three thousand year history. Innis's condensed, elliptical prose demands careful reading as he traces the origins of writing from clay tablet and cuneiform script to the efficient Phoenician alphabet written on parchment and papyrus. Along the way, Innis comments on many aspects of the ancient Middle Eastern empires, including power struggles between priests and kings, the evolution of military technologies and the development of the Hebrew Bible.|$|E

25|$|There is some {{overlap in}} the {{influences}} of the two authors (as could be expected from writers working {{in the same time}} period and location), such as a common interest in thinkers like Augustine of Hippo. However, the primary focus and concern of each writer seems to set them apart. For example, most of the works attributed to Fulgentius the bishop deal with his opposition to heretical factions such as Arianism, a topic for which Fabius Fulgentius seems to have no concern. Topics on which the bishop seemed to have been strongly opinionated (Arianism, free-will, etc.) are never discussed in the mythographer’s work, even when a discussion of such things would seem to fit <b>his</b> <b>discussion.</b> From a linguistic standpoint, the mythographer’s unique style and inclusion of otherwise unused words and idioms is not replicated {{in the work of the}} bishop, which suggests further a negative identification.|$|E
25|$|Bernard Lewis has {{cited the}} Greek philosopher Aristotle who, in <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> of slavery, stated that while Greeks are free by nature, 'barbarians' (non-Greeks) are slaves by nature, {{in that it}} is in their nature to be more willing to submit to despotic government. Though Aristotle does not specify any {{particular}} races, he argues that people from outside Greece are more prone to the burden of slavery than those from Greece. While Aristotle makes remarks about the most natural slaves being those with strong bodies and slave souls (unfit for rule, unintelligent) which would seem to imply a physical basis for discrimination, he also explicitly states that the right kind of souls and bodies don't always go together, implying that the greatest determinate for inferiority and natural slaves versus natural masters is the soul, not the body. This proto-racism is seen as an important precursor to modern racism by classicist Benjamin Isaac.|$|E
25|$|On 14 March, the Slovak {{parliament}} convened {{and heard}} Tiso's report on <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> with Hitler {{as well as}} on a possible declaration of independence. Some of the deputies were skeptical of making such a move, among other reasons {{due to the fact that}} some worried that the Slovak state would be too small and with a strong Hungarian minority. The debate was quickly brought to a head when Franz Karmasin, leader of the German minority in Slovakia, said that any delay in declaring independence would result in Slovakia being divided between Hungary and Germany. Under these circumstances, Parliament unanimously declared Slovak independence, thus creating the first Slovak state in history. Jozef Tiso was appointed the first Prime Minister of the new republic. The next day, Tiso sent a telegram (which had actually been composed the previous day in Berlin) asking the Reich to take over the protection of the newly minted state. The request was readily accepted.|$|E
50|$|Some authors, like James Lennox, {{have argued}} that Darwin was a teleologist, while others like Michael Ghiselin {{described}} this claim as a myth promoted by misinterpretations of <b>his</b> <b>discussions</b> and emphasized the distinction between using teleological metaphors and being teleological.|$|R
50|$|Christine is blind. She {{falls in}} love with Burrows, enjoying <b>his</b> <b>discussions</b> of the spirit and the soul but knowing little of his past. One day she is struck by a {{streetcar}} and knocked unconscious, causing Burrows to once again question his faith.|$|R
50|$|In <b>his</b> <b>discussions</b> he {{analyses}} several {{social issues}} that were improperly or insufficiently remedied in the past. For instance, he expresses astonishment {{that the issue of}} education for Jewish girls was so long ignored given the obvious need for such an institution.|$|R
