40|$|As the {{population}} tends to urbanize, the potential consumer market of fresh produce becomes {{distant from the}} producing farm. This distance brings to growers and handlers the problems of how to keep their fresh products unspoiled after harvest and during transit period of shipping, {{and how they can}} be delivered to the specified destination without substantial deterioration. It is the common interest of fruit growers, shippers, wholesalers, and retailers that the shelf-life of fresh fruit be prolonged to increase sales. Sweet cherries are one of the important fruit crops in Utah. Being highly perishable, <b>fresh</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> have relatively short storage life after harvest. It is known that the approximate limit for the successful commercial storage of <b>fresh</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> is about 10 days to 2 weeks only. A practicable measure for extending this storage limit has to be established so that the market may have <b>fresh</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> over a longer season and also be able to balance the time of plenty and the time of scarcity. Furthermore, the Utah grown cherries may find new outlets in the distant market. Thus the benefit will be shared by the grower, the seller, and the consumer. Metabolic breakdown and fungal deterioration are the two important factors which cause the spoilage of fruits. Studies have shown that with many perishable produces, precooling [...] the prompt application of refrigeration prior 2 to normal storage or transportation is the key to successful storage. Hydro -cooling treatment is considered to be advantageous especially in Utah, where high temperature and low relative humidity predominate during the harvest season of sweet cherries. Post-harvest chemical and packaging treatments of sweet cherries are possible approaches on ext ending the keeping quality of the fruits concerned. With some of the antifungal agents available today, the fungi which cause fruit decay might be successfully controlled. As a matter of fact, new fungicides, antifungal antibiotics, and packaging films are continuously developed by the industries in the United States. Appropriate combination of these newly developed materials with hydro-cooling followed by refrigerated storage, coupled with in vitro study of the effects of chemicals on fruit decay organisms, might lead to an improvement in the storage life of sweet cherries. It was with this idea in mind that experiments were conducted to study the effects of hydro-cooling, chemicals, and packaging treatments on preserving <b>fresh</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> and also in vitro effects of chemicals on certain fungi responsible for fruit deterioration...|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> (Prunus avium L.) are a nutritious fruit {{which are}} rich in {{polyphenols}} and have high antioxidant potential. Most <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> are consumed <b>fresh</b> and {{a small proportion of}} the total <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> production is value added to make processed food products. <b>Sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> are highly perishable fruit with a short harvest season, therefore extensive preservation and processing methods have been developed for the extension of their shelf-life and distribution of their products. Scope and approach: In this review, the main physicochemical properties of <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries,</b> as well as bioactive components and their determination methods are described. The study emphasises the recent progress of postharvest technology, such as controlled/modified atmosphere storage, edible coatings, irradiation, and biological control agents, to maintain <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> for the <b>fresh</b> market. Valorisations of second-grade <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries,</b> as well as trends for the diversification of cherry products for future studies are also discussed. Key findings and conclusions: <b>Sweet</b> <b>cherry</b> fruit have a short harvest period and marketing window. The major loss in quality after harvest include moisture loss, softening, decay and stem browning. Without compromising their eating quality, the extension in fruit quality and shelf-life for <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> is feasible by means of combination of good handling practice and applications of appropriate postharvest technology.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of short hyperbaric treatments to control postharvest decay of <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> (Prunus avium L., cv Ferrovia) and table grapes (Vitis vinifera L., cv Italia) was investigated. <b>Sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> and table grape berries {{were exposed to}} the pressure of 1140 mmHg (1. 5 atm) for 4 and 24 It, respectively, in 64 L gas-proof tanks. Fruit kept at ambient pressure (near 760 mmHg, 1. 0 atm) served as a control. Postharvest rots of <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> arose from naturally occurring infections, whereas table grape berries were artificially wounded, exposed to the hyperbaric treatment, then the wounds inoculated with 20 mu L of a Botrytis cinerea conidial suspension (5 x 10 (4) spores mL(- 1)). <b>Sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> were stored at 0 +/- 1 degrees C for 14 d, followed by 7 d at 20 +/- 1 degrees C.

40|$|<b>Sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> {{provide a}} major source of income to Michigan fruit growers. Annual {{production}} in Michigan during the period 1963 - 1971 averaged 44 million pounds, or 18 percent of the national total (Smith, et al. 1973). Bird damage to Michigan cherries is a major problem. Although no figures are available on the extent of <b>sweet</b> <b>cherry</b> damage, Stone (1973) estimated that in 1972 bird damage to Michigan tart cherries amounted to 17. 4 percent of the crop. According to growers we interviewed, damage to black <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> is often more severe than to tart cherries. These growers also report some damage to white <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> but, since whites are harvested before they ripen fully, {{they are less likely to}} be damaged than blacks. Because cherries are damaged primarily by species protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, nonlethal means of controlling damage are required. One promising means is a chemical (methiocarb [3, 5 -dimethyl- 4 -(methylthio) phenol methylcarbamate = Mesurol]), which has shown good results when used as a nonlethal bird repellent on several crops (Guarino 1972). In 1971, Guarino, et al. (1974) applied methiocarb to half a row of 17 <b>sweet</b> <b>cherry</b> trees and to half a block of 22 tart cherry trees in Michigan.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Program in Molecular Plant Sciences, Washington State UniversitySweet cherry is an {{important}} horticultural crop in Washington. <b>Sweet</b> <b>cherry</b> trees are grown as composite plants where the scion is grafted onto a rootstock. Rootstock genotype influences tree yield potential (among other traits) largely by affecting floral bud numbers. A transcriptomics approach (differential display and 3 'UTR sequencing) {{was used to examine}} the genetic mechanism of the rootstock's effect on floral bud initiation. The first section of this dissertation outlines the development of key genomic resources for <b>sweet</b> <b>cherry.</b> Utilizing both reference mapping and de novo genome assembly for the <b>sweet</b> <b>cherry</b> variety `Stella', 1. 5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified and 180 Mb of genome were assembled respectively. The identified polymorphisms were screened and roughly 300, 000 are located in peach genes and could be used as gene-based markers for future research. From this set, several genes involved in fruit ripening were found to contain nonsense mutations and could be the underlying cause for non-climacteric ripening in <b>sweet</b> <b>cherry.</b> Examining gene expression in developing floral buds of the scion, rootstock effects were identified through differential display and 3 'UTR analyses. Differential display identified 207 transcripts that were putatively controlled by the rootstock genotype while 3 'UTR identified 115 differentially expressed gene fragments. Several transcription factors including some with domains previously documented to control flowering were identified in these datasets and their expression levels were examined via qRT-PCR for verification. These studies have created vast amounts of information from both the <b>sweet</b> <b>cherry</b> genome and transcriptome. Many single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified and leveraged as DNA markers for screening <b>sweet</b> <b>cherry</b> populations. This demonstrated the rapid application of a small subset to aid <b>sweet</b> <b>cherry</b> breeding and population screening. Additionally, a computational program was developed to assess restriction sites in large datasets and used to convert the polymorphism information into cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence markers. Overall, the work described in this dissertation has laid the foundation for <b>sweet</b> <b>cherry</b> genomics research and identified several directions for future studies.

In some cases this return is not realised due to reduced growth, bud and even tree mortality caused by virus infections (DESVIGNES 1990; GILLES, VERHOYEN 1992; MINK, JONES 1996). Quantitative data {{on the relationship between}} virus infection and the effect on the reproductive and vegetative development of <b>sweet</b> <b>cherry</b> trees is limited.
