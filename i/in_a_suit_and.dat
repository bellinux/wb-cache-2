5|$|Resuming for New South Wales in 1952–53, Barnes scored 152 against Victoria in {{the last}} match before the {{beginning}} of the Test series against South Africa. Nevertheless, the selectors overlooked him for the first Test and in the following state match, against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval, Barnes offered to act as twelfth man to provide an opportunity for a younger player, Ray Flockton. During a drinks break {{on the second day of}} the match, he appeared on the ground <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>suit</b> <b>and</b> tie, (rather than 'whites') carrying superfluous items such as cigars, iced towels, a mirror and comb, a radio and a clothes brush. The crowd initially responded well to the joke, but their mood soured when the interval extended beyond its scheduled time and Barnes received criticism for delaying the game. The South Australian team, captained by Australian selector Phil Ridings, officially complained to the New South Wales Cricket Association (NSWCA), which asked Barnes to express regret over the incident. Despite the association's support for Barnes during his problems of the previous season, he prevaricated. Eventually, the NSWCA forwarded a written apology on his behalf.|$|E

25|$|The Alien {{is portrayed}} by both Woodruff, Jr. <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>suit</b> <b>and</b> a rod puppet filmed against bluescreen and {{optically}} composited into the live-action footage, with the rods removed by rotoscoping. A mechanical alien head {{was also used}} for close-ups. The suit adapted the design used in Aliens so Woodruff could walk on all fours. Woodruff's head was contained in {{the neck of the}} suit, because the head was filled with animatronics to move the mouth of the Alien. Fincher suggested that a Whippet be dressed in an alien costume for on-set coverage of the quadrupedal alien, but the visual effects team was dissatisfied with the comical result and the idea was dropped in favor of the puppet.|$|E

Then it cuts to him dressing up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>suit</b> <b>and</b> going onstage to sing the song {{in front of an}} audience of drag queens. Thomas Rogers from Salon criticized the video for portraying drag queens like [...] "patients in a mental ward" [...] as well as the interview sequence, which he felt equated drag queens as people with multiple personality disorder. A writer for Metro questioned [...] "Is Robbie trying to send us a message? Or has he just got extremely carried away playing dress up in his mother's wardrobe." ...|$|E
500|$|Popular with {{teammates}} and {{known for his}} sportsmanship, Marsh was regarded as an average fielder and had minimal batting skill, with a batting average of 5.00. He played out his days in the Sydney competition and topped the bowling aggregates from 1901 to 1904. Les Poidevin described Marsh as [...] "a well set-up, perfectly built ... man, with an ebony-black, smooth, clear shining skin and twinkling black eyes" [...] who [...] "is quite good looking". Marsh was short for a fast bowler standing 5ft 7ins (170cm) tall. In later years, Marsh experimented with the googly. Photographs of Marsh often show him fashionably dressed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>suit</b> <b>and</b> sporting a moustache.|$|E
500|$|... "You know what? When you see {{the video}} it's really amazing. Obviously we filmed it before this [...] {{happened}} and it's amazing irony, how much it makes sense. We're all separated and wandering the streets looking like it's the day after a funeral, with Ben <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>suit</b> <b>and</b> bare feet, and I'm never touching the ground. I'm sitting on a phone booth or lying on a car, to hint that I'm dead, that I'm singing from the dead. It's all about separation. It's almost like the director {{knew what was going}} to happen, but he can't have known. It's just one of those fate things." ...|$|E

500|$|Cooper's meticulous {{planning}} {{may also}} have extended to the timing of his operation, and even his choice of attire, according to Kaye's research team. [...] "The FBI searched but couldn't find anyone who disappeared that weekend," [...] Kaye wrote, suggesting that the perpetrator may have returned to his normal occupation. [...] "If you were planning on going 'back to work on Monday', then you would need {{as much time as}} possible {{to get out of the}} woods, find transportation and get home. The very best time for this is in front of a four-day weekend, which is the timing Dan Cooper chose for his crime." [...] Furthermore, [...] "if he was planning ahead, he knew he had to hitchhike out of the woods, and it is much easier to get picked up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>suit</b> <b>and</b> tie than in old blue jeans." ...|$|E
500|$|Barnes had a {{reputation}} as an eccentric and was frequently the subject of controversy. This included a celebrated libel case, following his exclusion from the national team in 1951–52 for [...] "reasons other than cricket ability". He was later involved in an incident where, acting as twelfth man, he performed his duties on the ground <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>suit</b> <b>and</b> tie (rather than 'whites'), carrying a bizarre range of superfluous items. Despite this reputation, Barnes was a shrewd businessman who used the opportunities afforded by cricket to supplement his income through trading, journalism and property development. Increasing paranoia brought about by bipolar disorder saw Barnes lose many of the friends he had made through the game, as he sought treatment for his depression. On 16 December 1973, he was found dead at his home in the Sydney suburb of Collaroy; he had ingested barbiturates and bromide in a probable suicide.|$|E
500|$|On January 26, 2014 {{the couple}} opened the 56th Annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, {{performing}} the song live {{together for the}} first time. The performance opened with Beyoncé sporting wet-look hair in a leotard and a leather basque, sitting on a chair {{with her back to the}} audience. She conctinued seductively dancing cabaret-style, singing and gyrating on the dark stage surrounded by smoke. Jay-Z appeared to rap his verses dressed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>suit</b> <b>and</b> bow tie. The sexually-charged performance ended with a kiss and the two walked off with their arms around each other. Beyoncé's chair dance received comparisons with scenes from the movie Flashdance, the song's music video and the video for [...] "Partition"; VH1's Emily Exton felt that it was one of the best chair dances of all time. The duet was described as [...] "scorching" [...] and [...] "chill inducing" [...] with many critics considering the performance to be a show highlight; Lily Harrison of E! added that the pair [...] "set the bar impossibly high". A Rolling Stone editor felt it was [...] "near flawless". Nadeska Alexis writing for MTV News noted that when the singer started singing the first verses of the song, [...] "you could almost taste the aroma of sex appeal in the air". A negative review came from Beverly Beckham of The Boston Globe who felt that the pair failed to showcase love in the lyrics and performance.|$|E

2500|$|The basic game of Hearts {{does not}} include card passing, but the most common {{variants}} do. Before each hand begins, each player chooses three cards, and passes them to another player. The main objectives of passing are to try to become [...] "short" [...] or [...] "void" [...] <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>suit,</b> <b>and</b> thus able to play off-suit when that suit is led; or to rid one's hand of [...] "dangerous" [...] cards that will likely force that player to take a trick containing penalty points, such as the Ace, King, or Queen of any suit (especially spades and hearts). There are many variations on passing; the most common (popularized by computer versions) rotates passing through four deals; on the first deal, players pass to the left, the second deal to the right, the third across the table. On the fourth deal no cards are passed; the cycle of four deals is then repeated.|$|E
2500|$|On the Raw Is War after Austin won the WWF Championship, Vince McMahon {{presented}} him with a new title belt and warned Austin {{that he did not}} approve of his rebellious nature and that things could be done [...] "the easy way or the hard way". Austin gave his answer in the form of another Stone Cold Stunner. This led to a segment a week later where Austin had pledged a few days prior in a meeting to [...] "play ball" [...] with McMahon, appearing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>suit</b> <b>and</b> tie, with a beaming McMahon taking a picture of himself and his new corporate champion. The entire thing was a ruse by Austin who {{in the course of the}} segment proceeded to tear off the suit, tell McMahon it was the last time he would see Austin dressed like this, punch his boss in the [...] "corporate grapefruits" [...] and take another picture of the two of them while McMahon was doubled over in pain. In April 1998, it appeared Austin and McMahon were going to battle out their differences in an actual match, but the match was declared a no contest when Dude Love made an appearance. This led to a match between Dude Love and Austin at , where Austin hit McMahon with a steel chair, then the following month they had a rematch at [...] for the WWF Championship. Austin managed to retain the title despite McMahon acting as the referee and his [...] "Corporate Stooges" [...] (Gerald Brisco and Pat Patterson) as timekeeper and ring announcer, respectively. McMahon continued to do everything he could to ruin Austin and he finally scored a big victory for his side at King of the Ring, where Austin lost the WWF Championship to Kane in a First Blood match after the Undertaker intervened and hit him with a chair while the ref was incapacitated, despite Austin having knocked Kane unconscious and thwarted an earlier intervention by Mankind.|$|E
