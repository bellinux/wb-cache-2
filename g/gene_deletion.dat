40|$|Dystrophinopathy is the commonest form of muscular {{dystrophy}} and comprises clinically recognized forms, Duchenne dystrophy and Becker dystrophy. Mutations in the dystrophin gene which consist of large <b>gene</b> <b>deletions</b> (65), duplications (5) and point mutations (30) {{are responsible for}} {{reducing the amount of}} functional dystrophin protein in skeletal muscle fibres leading to fibre destruction and disease. The aims of this study are to investigate the detection rate, types and distribution of large <b>gene</b> <b>deletions</b> in Malaysian dystrophinopathy patients using the multiplex polymerase chain reaction (MPCR). MPCR of 18 "hot-spot deletion" regions along the dystrophin gene was performed on DNA from 48 muscle biopsy-confirmed cases of dystrophinopathy. A positive detection rate of 58 (28 / 48) was observed, where 84 (16 / 19) Indian, 35 (6 / 17) Chinese and 50 (6 / 12) Malay ethnic groups showed deletions in their dystrophin genes. The Malaysian Indians appear to have a higher prevalence for large <b>gene</b> <b>deletions</b> compared to the Chinese and Malays. Further analyses of 42 confirmed positive cases (present 28 plus previous 14 cases) by MPCR showed the majority of deletions were in the mid-distal region of the dystrophin gene (81 in exons 45 - 60).

25|$|Within tissues, IGFBP-3 can bind IGF-1 and IGF-2 {{released}} by many cell types, and block {{their access to}} the IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R), which is activated by both IGFs. IGFBP-3 also interacts with cell-surface proteins, affecting cell signaling from outside the cell or after internalization, and also enters the cell nucleus where it binds to nuclear hormone receptors and other ligands. High levels of IGFBP-3 within tumors are associated with increased cancer severity (or worse outcome) for some cancers, but decreased severity or better outcome for others.

40|$|Abstract Background Triacylglycerols {{are used}} in various {{purposes}} including food applications, cosmetics, oleochemicals and biofuels. Currently the main sources for triacylglycerol are vegetable oils, and microbial triacylglycerol has been suggested as an alternative for these. Due to the low production rates and yields of microbial processes, the role of metabolic engineering has become more significant. As a robust model organism for genetic and metabolic studies, and for the natural capability to produce triacylglycerol, Acinetobacter baylyi ADP 1 serves as an excellent organism for modelling the effects of metabolic engineering for energy molecule biosynthesis. Results Beneficial <b>gene</b> <b>deletions</b> regarding triacylglycerol production were screened by computational means exploiting the metabolic model of ADP 1. Four deletions, acr 1, poxB, dgkA, and a triacylglycerol lipase were chosen to be studied experimentally both separately and concurrently by constructing a knock-out strain (MT) with three of the deletions. Improvements in triacylglycerol production were observed: the strain MT produced 5. 6 fold more triacylglycerol (mg/g cell dry weight) compared to the wild type strain, {{and the proportion of}} triacylglycerol in total lipids was increased by 8 -fold. Conclusions In silico predictions of beneficial <b>gene</b> <b>deletions</b> were verified experimentally. The chosen single and multiple <b>gene</b> <b>deletions</b> affected beneficially the natural triacylglycerol metabolism of A. baylyi ADP 1. This study demonstrates the importance of single <b>gene</b> <b>deletions</b> in triacylglycerol metabolism, and proposes Acinetobacter sp.

40|$|In the Peruvian Amazon, Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax malaria are endemic {{in rural}} areas, where {{microscopy}} is not available. Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) provide quick and accurate diagnosis. However, pfhrp 2 <b>gene</b> <b>deletions</b> may limit {{the use of}} histidine-rich protein- 2 (PfHRP 2) detecting RDTs. Further, cross-reactions of P. falciparum with P. vivax-specific test lines and vice versa may impair diagnostic specificity. Thirteen RDT products were evaluated on 179 prospectively collected malaria positive samples. Species diagnosis was performed by microscopy and confirmed by PCR. Pfhrp 2 <b>gene</b> <b>deletions</b> were assessed by PCR. Sensitivity for P. falciparum diagnosis was lower for PfHRP 2 compared to P. falciparum-specific Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (Pf-pLDH) -detecting RDTs (71. 6 % vs. 98. 7 %, p< 0. 001). Most (19 / 21) false negative PfHRP 2 results were associated with pfhrp 2 <b>gene</b> <b>deletions</b> (25. 7 % of 74 P. falciparum samples). Diagnostic sensitivity for P. vivax (101 samples) was excellent, except for two products. In 10 / 12 P. vivax-detecting RDT products, cross-reactions with the PfHRP 2 or Pf-pLDH line occurred at a median frequency of 2. 5 % (range 0 %- 10. 9 %) of P. vivax samples assessed. In two RDT products, two and one P. falciparum samples respectively cross-reacted with the Pv-pLDH line.

And can we use perturbation studies {{to uncover the}} functions and organization of metabolic networks at a cellular level? We address these questions by performing large-scale computer experiments of single and double enzyme <b>gene</b> <b>deletions,</b> based on Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) [1]. Through the comparison of model predictions and experimental data for single <b>gene</b> <b>deletions</b> in E. coli, {{we found that the}} perturbed networks can deviate significantly from the optimal growth capacity approached by the wild type. In fact, mutants may be better described by assuming a minimal redistribution of fluxes with respect to the unperturbed cell [2]. The study of the combined effect (epistasis) of double <b>gene</b> <b>deletions</b> allowed us to analyze the functional organization and modular structure of biochemical networks. In a system-level analysis of the yeast S. cerevisiae we identified pairs of <b>genes</b> whose combined <b>deletion</b> affects growth significantly more (synergistic), or significantly less (buffering) than what expected based on the single deletions. We found that the ensuing network of epistatic interactions can be organized hierarchically into function-enriched modules that interact "monochromatically, " i. e. with purely synergistic or purely buffering links [3]. This property extends epistasis from single genes to functional units, and provides a novel definition of biological modularity, which emphasizes interactions between, rather than within, functional modules.
