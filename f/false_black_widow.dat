50|$|Many spiders of {{the genus}} Steatoda are often mistaken for widow spiders (Latrodectus), and are known as <b>false</b> <b>black</b> <b>widows.</b> They are closely related (in the family Theridiidae) but Steatoda are {{significantly}} less harmful to humans. Not all Steatoda species resemble widows - many have distinct coloring, and are significantly smaller than Latrodectus specimens. Some species of Steatoda will actually prey on widows, {{as well as other}} spiders which are considered hazardous to humans.|$|R

The opening credits feature Batman rope-climbing up a building, something that Adam West and Burt Ward often did in the show. Several villains from the 1960s show including King Tut, Egghead, Mad Hatter, Archer, Bookworm, <b>False</b> Face, <b>Black</b> <b>Widow,</b> Siren, Marsha Queen of Diamonds, Louie the Lilac, Ma Parker, and Shame make cameo appearances as prisoners at Iron Heights prison in the episode [...] "Day of the Dark Knight!"

The episode [...] "Game Over for Owlman!" [...] shows a room in the Batcave containing [...] "souvenirs" [...] of deathtraps that the Joker employed in the 1960s series, with accompanying flashbacks: the giant key from the [...] "Human Key Duplicator" [...] from [...] "The Impractical Joker", the slot machine-controlled electric chair from [...] "The Joker Goes to School", and the giant clam from [...] "The Joker's Hard Times". The episode [...] "The Color of Revenge!"

Additionally, the Adam West Batman briefly appears in [...] "Night of the Batmen!" [...] as part of an army of Batmen gathered across the Multiverse.|$|R

40|$|Objective: ‘ Steatoda nobilis ’, {{commonly}} known as the <b>false</b> <b>black</b> <b>widow</b> spider, is an immigrant spider originating from the Canary Islands. Closely related to the black widow species but lacking its distinctive red spot, this spider was fi rst reported in the UK in 1879. It has since become acclimatised along the south coast of England although National Poisons Information Service (NPIS) call records indicate that it has been witnessed as far north as Yorkshire. While the spider is not considered aggressive, it possesses large venomous fangs that can instigate ‘ instant ’ severe pain, described as being worse than a wasp sting. Methods: A case study is reported and enquiries to NPIS concerning <b>false</b> <b>black</b> <b>widow</b> spider bites between August 2007 and August 2011 were analysed with regard to location and features. Case report: A 41 -year-old male presented to the accident and emergency department two days after being bitten on the calf by a spider subsequently identifi ed as ‘ Steatoda nobilis ’. He was treated prophylactically with co-amoxiclav. The skin around the bite was warm and discoloured with acute swelling at the puncture site. NPIS advised that apart from appropriate analgesia further treatment was unlikely to be required and that localised features from the envenomation would subside with time. Other than mild cellulitis in the calf and a raised CRP (31 mg/L), this patient exhibited no systemic complications and was discharged the same day. Results: NPIS received 21 enquiries involving ‘ Steatoda nobilis ’ throughout the study period. The majority of enquiries were from southern England with a few as far north as Yorkshire and Suffolk. Localised oedema was the most signifi cant feature along with hypoaesthesia, paraesthesia and skin rash. Systemic features such as tachycardia, chest tightness, vomiting, anxiety with increased sweating and fever were also reported in fi ve cases. Conclusion: It has been reported that ‘ Steatoda nobilis ’ bites may be neurotoxic and affect the parasympathetic nervous system. 1 Nevertheless, NPIS experience suggests that these bites, although sometimes medically signifi cant, can be managed successfully with supportive care and analgesia.

50|$|Latrodectus variolus, the {{northern}} <b>black</b> <b>widow</b> spider or northern widow, is a medically important spider {{species of the}} genus Latrodectus in the family Theridiidae.

50|$|There {{are several}} spider species all named black widow: {{southern}} <b>black</b> <b>widow</b> spider (L. mactans), the European <b>black</b> <b>widow</b> (L. tredecimguttatus), Western <b>black</b> <b>widow</b> spider (L. hesperus), Northern <b>black</b> <b>widow</b> spider (L. variolus). Other Latrodectus that cause latrodectism are the Australian redback spider (L. hasselti), and the New Zealand katipo spider (L. katipo). Several {{other members of}} Latrodectus genus are not commonly associated with latrodectism including the cosmopolitan brown widow (L. geometricus).|$|R

25|$|As of 2012, {{researchers}} at the University of California, Riverside, suggested that the brown widow spider, newly established in Southern California, {{may in fact be}} displacing <b>black</b> <b>widow</b> spiders from the region, competing and/or fighting for territory. While certainly not definitive, this evidence does suggest that the brown widow is likely to be more hostile and aggressive towards its relative, the <b>black</b> <b>widow,</b> than the <b>black</b> <b>widow</b> is towards it. If that proves to be true, humans may be positively affected because, over time, brown widows will aggressively eradicate and replace the <b>black</b> <b>widows</b> from the areas they inhabit, and since brown widows are less venomous than <b>black</b> <b>widows,</b> this may have the effect of making those areas safer.|$|R
