40|$|Caribbean <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> {{have been}} {{harvested}} in Floridafor over 100 {{years and have}} been one of the state’s most valuable commercial fishery and perhaps the most intensive recreational fishery of any lobster species; however, landings and lobster population abundance declined beginning in 2000. The goal of the study was to review the life history and ecology of Panulirus argus inFlorida and assess potential population enhancement strategies for each stage. The study was conducted through a search of scientific literature, unpublished reports, popular books and personal communications. Potential population enhancement methods with respect to the Panulirus argus’s life history that were examined include larvae aquaculture and seeding, pueruli aquaculture or capture with seeding as well as protection of pueruli habitat, algal-phase juvenile habitat protection and habitat augmentation, post-algal juvenile habitat protection and habitat augmentation as well as growout of pueruli to latter stage juveniles for seeding, and sub-legal and legal size lobster habitat protection and habitat augmentation. Of these, two options seem most viable, 1) protection and augmentation of sponge and coral species that comprise juvenile lobster habitat or the utilization of artificial habitats to increase the number of size-appropriate shelters and 2) aquaculture of lobsters or growout of wild-caught pueruli to latter stage juveniles for subsequent seeding. Increased habitat would likely increase habitat carrying capacity and decrease lobster mortality by predation. Growout and seeding would also reduce predation on lobsters by by-passing the high mortality of small lobsters during that portion of their life cycle. Potential population enhancement could also be achieved by revisingFlorida’s lobster fishing regulations. Regulations need to better address the high mortality of sub-legal size lobsters used as attractants for “baiting” traps, a minimum size limit below the size of maturity, landing quotas or lack thereof that allows 90 % of legal-size lobsters to be taken each year and a harvesting season that allows the disturbance of ovigerous females. Of these fishery regulations, elimination of the existing fishery practice of “baiting”, increasing the minimum size limit, and enacting landing quotas seem to have the most potential to enhance <b>Florida’s</b> <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> population. Decreased mortality of undersized lobsters and an increase in the size of harvested lobsters would also help restoreFlorida’s historic lobster population size structure and the number of lobsters spawning each year. The findings of this study suggest that there are several viable methods to enhanceFlorida’sCaribbean <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> population to provide for both sustained fishery landings and improved lobster population abundance...|$|R

A trapping study was conducted off Southeastern Florida during 1984 / 1985 using control traps, and traps with escape gap openings of 51, 54, and 57 mm. The 51 mm escape gap caught significantly more legal lobsters than any other trap, while the 54 and 57 mm escape gap caught significantly fewer sublegal lobsters. Carapace lengths of lobsters increased as escape gap width increased. The impact of escape gaps on behavior of Panulirus argus was examined through field and laboratory observations. Lobsters with a carapace length of 75 mm or less were observed entering and exiting through a 51 mm escape gap. Legal lobsters (≥ 76 mm CL) were unable {{to escape from the}} trap.

From the samples collected during 2007, phyllosoma larvae of Justitia longimanus, Panulirus argus, Parribacus spp., S. americanus, S. depressus and P. gundlachi were positively identified. Relative density catches of the phyllosoma larvae indicate that P. argus (<b>Florida</b> <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster)</b> is the most abundant species in the Straits of Florida. Data gathered during the study shows that P. argus larvae at different developmental stages occur throughout the year which supports the theory of multiple spawning and/or multiple sources. Larvae of genus Panulirus are difficult to distinguish from plankton samples and hence were identified as of P. argus since it is the most common species in the area. Family Palinuridae and Scyllaridae larval density spikes in July and May, coincide with their spawning peak periods of late March – early May and late January to late March respectively. Members of family Palinuridae showed higher densities at night, whereas those of family Scyllaridae showed higher densities during day catches.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the bias in fishermans predicted participation {{rates in the}} target fishery associated with ignoring the multi-species aspect of labor supply decisions in spatial bio-economic fishery models. Recent advancements {{have been made to}} simultaneously model the biology of a marine species and the strategic behavior of harvesters over both time and space in order to more accurately predict the effect of regulatory policies on harvester effort and resource population. These models assume a nested choice structure in which the harvester first faces a dichotomous decision between shifting for the target species or not on a given day and then chooses a location to finish conditional on participation. This structure implicitly groups all non-target species options together in the first nest forcing participation-specific coefficients to be the same for all outside options, including fishing for an alternative species and staying home, two very different choices. Using a complete 15 -year panel of all fishing trips made by fishermen possessing a <b>Florida</b> <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> license, including non-lobster trips, I show that the simplifying assumption of a dichotomous choice structure in the first nest is not innocuous and that the participation probabilities can change substantially with the addition of another species as an outside alternative.

40|$|The Fishery Performance Indicators (FPIs) {{have been}} {{successfully}} applied to commercial fisheries around the globe and have uncovered key insights into fishery management success. We developed {{an extension of the}} FPIs to consider performance of recreational fisheries. The Sport FPIs were developed through multiple iterations of consulting, piloting and revision with fisheries experts. The indicators were tested on three case study fisheries: Florida tarpon, Florida bay scallops and <b>Florida</b> <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster.</b> These case studies and the authors’ experiences led to further revision of the instrument. The structure of the Sport FPIs relies heavily on the original FPI framework due to its success in addressing the lack of standardized, precise fishery data. Some aspects of commercial fisheries are analogous to recreational fisheries and commercial indicators required only minor revision to effectively measure recreational performance. To capture other aspects of recreational fisheries required development of new indicators. Thirty-two new output indicators and 33 new input indicators were developed to capture recreational fishery success and to explain outcomes. New indicators were designed to capture the social utility and the impact of recreational fishing expenditures on the local community.  New input indicators were developed including indicators characterized by angler motivations and common recreational management strategies such as fish stocking, habitat enhancement, bag limits, among others.

40|$|Abstract only. With a {{national}} policy on catch shares in {{progress in the}} United States and increasing use of transferable fishing rights in fisheries worldwide, {{it is important to}} understand how the markets created by these programs function in the real world. This paper presents information collected from interviews with <b>Florida</b> <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> fishermen on how the market for trap certificates works, how they make decisions to buy and sell certificates, and their perceptions of the program. The interviews indicate that the fishermen participate in the market in ways we expect, but may be hindered by cultural and social differences that impede transfers; program provisions that affect decision-making in transfers; and the emergence of brokers in the market. The study also revealed how information about certificate prices and availability circulates within and between fishing communities, and how this affects the market and the outcomes of the program. When compared to results from previous analyses of transactions data, the interviews also provide information on validity of conclusions, and offers alternative explanations uncovered when the fishermen themselves explain the trap certificate market. The results of this paper suggest that management and regulating agencies should directly address these issues that could affect the market when developing and amending transferable fishing rights programs. Additionally, it exemplifies the importance of combining interviews with fishermen with economic analyses in monitoring and evaluation in order to gain a better understanding of how these programs work...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The <b>Florida</b> <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> trap {{certificate}} program (TCP) {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} U. S. fisheries programs involving tradable effort permits. Under the TCP, fishers must own a certificate (and pay an associated annual fee) for each trap used. The program was created in 1992 to address overcapitalization amid growing social conflict in the fishery due to open-access regulation. Consequently, the total number of certificates (effort) is periodically reduced. However, no terminal effort level was designated so an intense debate has developed over future reductions. A bioeconomic analysis revealed that the current effort level (which is 34 % below the initial level) remains approximately three times higher than even the most liberal estimate of “optimal ” effort (i. e., effort that would generate the maximum economic yield). An analysis of the certificate market also indicated that prices have not approached levels reflecting the net present value of rents at the optimal effort level. These results suggest that existing regulations have failed to achieve the potentially large economic surplus that could result from optimal management. Prior to the implementation of similar programs, resource managers may want to consider lessons learned from the TCP. First, the social and political forces created by granting harvest rights tend to accentuate the problems of contracting among heterogeneous participants. Second, the fee schedule and budgetary issues can affect the structure and performance of the transfer market. Lastly, an elusive social surplus may not be a sufficient reward to overcome social, economic, and regulatory impediments to economically optimal regulation...|$|E

Slow moving or sessile benthic marine invertebrates, which serve as main food of most <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> in the wild have also been found useful in culture trials of lobsters. Marine food items are preferred over terrestrial animal food by lobsters and among marine food sources, shellfish (particularly mussels) is preferred over finfish (Booth and Kittaka, 1994).
