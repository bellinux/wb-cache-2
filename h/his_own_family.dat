5|$|By 1720, Vanbrugh's direct {{connection}} with the theatre had been terminated, but the leases and rents had been transferred to both <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>family</b> {{and that of his}} wife's through a series of trusts and benefices, with Vanbrugh himself building a new home in Greenwich. After the fire, the Vanbrugh family's long association with the theatre was terminated, and all their leases were surrendered by 1792.|$|E
5|$|He {{rejected}} German racial supremacy {{and instead}} saw the Norwegian race as the progenitor of northern Europe, tracing <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>family</b> tree {{in his spare}} time. Party members did not receive preferential treatment, though Quisling did not himself share in the wartime hardships of his fellow Norwegians. Nevertheless, many gifts went unused {{and he did not}} live extravagantly.|$|E

5|$|Kafka {{finished}} {{none of his}} full-length {{novels and}} burned around 90 percent of his work, much of it during the period he lived in Berlin with Diamant, who helped him burn the drafts. In his early years as a writer, he was influenced by von Kleist, whose work he described {{in a letter to}} Bauer as frightening, and whom he considered closer than <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>family.</b>|$|E
5|$|Malcolm Reed, {{played by}} Dominic Keating, is {{tactical}} {{officer of the}} Enterprise, also in charge of ship security.

5|$|Unusually in Japan, where photographers tend to join or form groups, Kikai {{has never}} been in any group, preferring to work by himself. When not setting out to take photographs, Kikai does not carry a camera with him. He leaves photographing <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>family</b> to his wife Noriko, and it is she who has the camera if they go on a trip together.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he made no}} pretence {{regarding}} {{the significance of the}} Senate under his absolute rule, those senators he deemed unworthy were expelled from the Senate, and in the distribution of public offices he rarely favoured family members; a policy that stood in contrast to the nepotism practiced by Vespasian and Titus. Above all, however, Domitian valued loyalty and malleability in those he assigned to strategic posts, qualities he found more often in men of the equestrian order than in members of the Senate or <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>family,</b> whom he regarded with suspicion, and promptly removed from office if they disagreed with imperial policy.|$|E
5|$|Despite the uncertainly {{surrounding}} {{the inception of}} his reign, the chronicle reveals that Lǫgmaðr faced continued opposition from within <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>family</b> {{in the form of}} an ongoing rebellion by his brother, Haraldr. Lǫgmaðr eventually overcame Haraldr, however, and is stated to have had the latter blinded and emasculated. Afterwards, if the chronicle is to be believed, Lǫgmaðr repented the cruelty that he had inflicted upon Haraldr, and remorsefully resigned his kingdom, before setting off to Jerusalem, where he died.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from holding}} {{positions}} of responsibility in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>family's</b> companies, Godrej also sits {{as an independent}} director {{on the boards of}} several non-group companies. As of 2016, these include Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata Teleservices, and Taj Hotels.|$|R
5000|$|Hatch critiqued President Donald Trump's 2017 {{executive}} order to temporarily curtail Muslim immigration until better screening methods are devised. He reflected on <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>family's</b> immigration history {{and described the}} order as placing [...] "unnecessary burdens" [...] on families.|$|R
5000|$|According to Cavallaro, {{the plot}} {{is based on the}} true stories of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>family's</b> history, {{specifically}} an event that occurred in his father's home town Maropati in 1923. [...] The character of Paolo is modeled after Cavallaro's paternal grandfather.|$|R
5|$|Family {{and family}} history also plays an {{important}} role in the poem. Eliot found information on his family from Sketch of the Eliot Family, which described how Eliot's family lived in East Coker for 200 years. When Andrew Eliott left, he disrupted the family history. Similarly, Eliot broke from <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>family</b> when he travelled away from his family, a family that he saw was declining. Within the poem, Eliot emphasizes the need for a journey and the need for inward change.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1921, Howe was vacationing {{with the}} Roosevelts at Campobello Island when Franklin {{began to run}} a high fever and {{reported}} paralysis in his legs.

5|$|Romanos Lekapenos {{had risen}} to power in 919, when {{he had managed to}} appoint himself regent over the young Constantine VII and marry his {{daughter}} Helena to him. Within a year, he successively rose from basileopator to Caesar, and was eventually crowned senior emperor on 17 December 920. To consolidate his hold on power, and with a view of supplanting the ruling Macedonian dynasty with <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>family,</b> he raised his eldest son Christopher to co-emperor in May 921, while Stephen and Constantine were proclaimed co-emperors on 25 December 924.|$|E
50|$|<b>His</b> <b>own</b> <b>family's</b> {{international}} adoption, {{discovery that}} their children were stolen, and ultimately successful, though arduous, six year search for the girls' original birth family in India was featured on NPR's Morning Edition titled Adoption Stories Gone Bad, and by ABC News.|$|R
50|$|He was {{something}} of an amateur historian with a particular interest in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>familys</b> history.

50|$|After {{dispensing}} justice {{with his}} fists, Botchan drops {{a letter of}} resignation into the mail and immediately heads for the harbor.

5|$|That same year, he {{illustrated}} the pro-occupation book Zóó zag Brussel de Dietsche Militanten under the pen name Kaproen. In the 1970s Willy denied rumors, based on drawing style, {{that he had}} been the real artist behind Kaproen, but in 2010 these allegations were confirmed after an investigation demanded by <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>family.</b> Unlike his partners, Vandersteen was later not persecuted for his part in publishing the antisemitic drawings, which were considered collaboration with the Nazis.|$|E
5|$|The {{family was}} {{conceived}} by Groening shortly before a solicitation {{for a series}} of animated shorts with producer James L. Brooks. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>family,</b> substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. After a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and became an early hit for Fox, becoming the network's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989–90).|$|E
5|$|According to Kint, Söze {{began his}} {{criminal}} {{career as a}} petty drug dealer in his native Turkey. His legendary persona is born when rival Hungarian smugglers invade his house while he is away, rape his wife, and hold his children hostage; when Söze arrives, they kill one of his children and demand he surrender his business. Instead, Söze kills <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>family</b> and {{all but one of}} the Hungarians, who he knows will tell the Mafia what has happened. Once his family is buried, Söze targets the Hungarian Mafia, their families, friends, and people who owe them money. He goes underground, never again doing business in person.|$|E

5|$|After {{finishing}} his schooling Kagame made two visits to Rwanda, in 1977 and 1978. He was initially hosted {{by family members}} of his former classmates, but upon arrival in Kigali he made contact with members of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>family.</b> He kept a low profile on these visits, believing that {{his status as a}} well-connected Tutsi exile could lead to arrest; on his second visit he entered the country through Zaire rather than Uganda to avoid suspicion. Kagame used his time in Rwanda to explore the country, familiarise himself with the political and social situation, and make connections that would prove useful to him in his later activities.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he learned}} his {{repertoire}} {{by listening to}} elders perform traditional pieces, Rakoto Frah often performed personalized variations and interpreted the traditional airs in original ways. The themes addressed in his songs ranged from serious to light-hearted and could touch on social concerns, behavior and the description of places. Rakoto Frah used both traditional flutes and those he crafted himself using diverse locally available materials. These included flutes crafted from sections of metal ski poles, PVC pipes and plastic curtain rods. He was never known to be without a flute and was widely respected for his musical virtuosity and his kindness alike. Rakoto Frah described music {{the most important element}} of life, even more important to him than <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>family.</b> Over the course of his career, the artist produced more than 800pieces of instrumental and vocal music.|$|E
5|$|Domitian's {{approach}} to government was less subtle {{than his father}} and brother. Once Emperor, he quickly dispensed with the Republican facade and transformed his government more or less formally into the divine monarchy he believed it to be. By moving the centre of power to the imperial court, Domitian openly rendered the Senate's powers obsolete. He became personally involved in all branches of the administration: edicts were issued governing the smallest details of everyday life and law, while taxation and public morals were rigidly enforced. Nevertheless, Domitian did make concessions toward senatorial opinion. Whereas his father and brother had virtually excluded non-Flavians from public office, Domitian rarely favoured <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>family</b> members {{in the distribution of}} strategic posts, admitting a surprisingly large number of provincials and potential opponents to the consulship, and assigning men of the equestrian order to run the imperial bureaucracy.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{his return}} to Australia, {{he worked as a}} jackaroo in Queensland and New South Wales. He was {{appointed}} as overseer of the [...] "Nareen" [...] property in Western Victoria, then owned by future Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. He managed <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>family's</b> property at Benalla, before moving to Glenburn in 1964.|$|R
