5|$|Extracts of Narcissus have {{demonstrated}} {{a number of}} potentially useful biological properties including antiviral, prophage induction, antibacterial, antifungal, antimalarial, insecticidal, cytotoxic, antitumor, antimitotic, antiplatelet, hypotensive, emetic, acetylcholine esterase inhibitory, antifertility, antinociceptive, chronotropic, pheromone, plant <b>growth</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> and allelopathic. An ethanol extract of Narcissus bulbs was found effective in one mouse model of nociception, para-benzoquinone induced abdominal constriction, but not in another, the hot plate test. Most of these properties are due to alkaloids, but some are also due to mannosa-binding lectins. The most-studied alkaloids in this group are galantamine (galanthamine), lycorine, narciclasine, and pretazettine.|$|E

40|$|Grain {{growth and}} {{abnormal}} grain growth in tungsten carbide cobalt composites (cemented carbides, hardmetals) are usually discussed {{with respect to}} liquid phase sintering (Ostwald ripening). Densification and grain growth during solid state sintering are not as thoroughly studied but do {{play an important role}} in sintering hardmetals and, particularly tungsten carbide ceramics (binderless hardmetals). In this work the influences of sintering temperature, carbon content, additions of grain <b>growth</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> defects and dislocations (microstrain) introduced by milling on the densification and microstructure of WC ceramics were studied including density, micro structural, thermal and X-ray analysis. Microstrain promotes densification and results in lowering the sintering temperature, whereas free carbon seems to hinder densification at low temperatures and to promote it slightly at higher temperatures. Depending on sintering regime, free carbon and microstrain may drastically boost abnormal grain growth. By adding grain <b>growth</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> densification is shifted to higher temperatures. However, the addition prevents abnormal grain growth regardless of C-content and microstrain. Like in hardmetals grain <b>growth</b> <b>inhibitors</b> also inhibit normal grain growth. The findings are relevant for sintering of WC ceramics and hardmetals alike...|$|R

40|$|We present nine diallelic {{models of}} genetic {{conflict}} {{in which one}} allele is imprintable {{and the other is}} not to examine how genomic imprinting may have evolved. Imprinting is presumed to be either maternal (i. e., the maternally derived gene is inactivated) or paternal. Females are assumed to be either completely monogamous or always bigamous, so that we may see any effect of multiple paternity. In contrast to previous verbal and quantitative genetic models, we find that genetic conflicts need not lead to paternal imprinting of <b>growth</b> <b>inhibitors</b> and maternal imprinting of growth enhancers. Indeed, in some of our models [...] those with strict monogamy [...] the dynamics of maternal and paternal imprinting are identical. Multiple paternity is not necessary for the evolution of imprinting, and in our models of maternal imprinting, multiple paternity has no effect at all. Nevertheless, multiple paternity favors the evolution of paternal imprinting of <b>growth</b> <b>inhibitors</b> and hinders that of growth enhancers. Hence, any degree of multiple paternity means that <b>growth</b> <b>inhibitors</b> {{are more likely to be}} paternally imprinted, and growth enhancers maternally so. In all of our models, stable polymorphism of imprinting status is possible and mean fitness can decrease over time. Neither of these behaviors have been predicted by previous models...|$|R

40|$|Ultrafine and nanoscaled hardmetals show {{mechanical}} properties like hardness and bending strength which lie way above conventional fine or submicron grained hardmetals. To achieve such fine microstructures very fine WC starting powders {{as well as}} grain <b>growth</b> <b>inhibitors</b> such as Cr 3 C 2 or VC are needed. To study the grain growth inhibition in ultrafine hardmetals investigations on samples made from nearly nanoscaled WC and Co starting powders with and without the addition of Cr 3 C 2 were done. For studying the dissolution behaviour of Cr 3 C 2 {{and the evolution of}} density, magnetic properties and lattice parameters of WC during sintering, interrupted sintering experiments were carried out. Thermal analysis techniques including TG-MS and DSC were used, to link the observed changes to expected reactions. The results show that grain <b>growth</b> <b>inhibitors</b> greatly influence the sintering behaviour already way below the eutectic melting of WC-Co. Especially dissolution of Cr 3 C 2 and homogenous distribution of Cr within the samples already starts below 800 °C with the reduction of W-surface oxides and the creation and spreading of Cr-oxides.

40|$|Investigations into {{mechanisms}} that restrict {{the recovery of}} functions after an injury to the brain or the spinal cord {{have led to the}} discovery of specific neurite growth inhibitory factors in the adult central nervous system (CNS) of mammals.
