40|$|Although a bladed disk is {{typically}} designed to have identical blades, manufacturing tolerances, wear, and other causes may cause random deviations among the blades. The blade-to-blade discrepancies, denoted as mistuning, lead to vibratory responses mostly concentrated in small {{regions of the}} bladed-disk assembly, according to a phenomenon called localization. The resulting spatial confinement of the vibration energy causes the responses of some blades to become dangerously high and increases the amplitude of the bladed-disk assembly's overall response. The attendant increase in stresses can lead to premature high cycle fatigue (HCF) of the blades. In this study we investigate whether vibration localization in a perfectly symmetric bladed <b>disk</b> <b>assembly</b> may occur {{in the presence of}} nonlinearity.

When a falling bar strikes {{the opposite side of}} a threaded rod fastened to the circular disk, or a falling circular pipe collides with the circular disk or with the anvil attached {{to the end of a}} screw, a stress wave propagating from the collision interface is transmitted into the assembly.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{the design and}} {{characterization}} of a novel platform for mechanical cell lysis {{of even the most}} difficult to lyse cell types on a micro or nanoscale (maximum 70 Î¼L total volume). The system incorporates a machined plastic circular <b>disk</b> <b>assembly,</b> magnetic field actuated microfluidics, centrifugal cells and tissue homogenizer and centrifugation system. The mechanism of tissue disruption of this novel cell homogenization apparatus derives from the relative motion of ferromagnetic metal disks and grinding matrices in a liquid medium within individual chambers of the disk in the presence of an oscillating magnetic field. The oscillation of the ferromagnetic disks or blades produces mechanical impaction and shear forces capable of disrupting cells within the chamber both by direct action of the blade and by the motion of the surrounding lysis matrix, and by motion induced vortexing of buffer fluid. Glass beads or other grinding media are integrated into each lysis chamber within the disk to enhance the transfer of energy from the oscillating metal blade to the cells. The system also achieves the centrifugal elimination of solids from each liquid sample and allows the elution of clarified supernatants via siphoning into a collection chamber fabricated into the plastic <b>disk</b> <b>assembly.</b> This article describes system design, implementation and validation of proof of concept on two samples-Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae representing model systems for cells that are easy and difficult to lyse, respectively. close 494...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} use of order-tuned {{absorbers}} to attenuate vibrations of flexible blades in a bladed <b>disk</b> <b>assembly</b> subjected to engine order excitation. The blades are modeled by a cyclic chain of N oscillators, and a single vibration absorber is fitted to each blade. These absorbers exploit the centrifugal field arising from rotation {{so that they are}} tuned to a given order of rotation, rather than to a fixed frequency. A standard change of coordinates based on the cyclic symmetry of the system essentially decouples the governing equations of motion, yielding a closed form solution for the steady-state response of the overall system. These results show that optimal reduction of blade vibrations is achieved by tuning the absorbers to the excitation order n, but that the resulting system is highly sensitive to small perturbations. Intentional detuning (meaning that the absorbers are slightly over-or under-tuned relative to n) can be implemented in order to improve the robust-ness of the design. It is shown that by slightly undertuning the absorbers there are no system resonances over the full range of possible rotor speeds, resulting in a system that is robust to mistuning (i. e., small random uncertainties in the system parameters) of the absorbers and/or blades. These results offer a basic understand-ing of the dynamics of a bladed <b>disk</b> <b>assembly</b> fitted with order-turned vibration absorbers, and serve as a first step to the investigation of more realistic models, where, for example, imperfections, multi-DOF blade models, nonlinear effects, and general-path absorbers are employed...|$|E

40|$|The retinal rod outer {{segment is}} a sensory cilium that is {{specialized}} for {{the conversion of}} light into an electrical signal. Within the cilium, up to several thousand membranous disks contain {{as many as a}} billion copies of rhodopsin for efficient photon capture. Disks are continually turned over, requiring the daily synthesis of a prodigious amount of rhodopsin. To promote axial diffusion in the aqueous cytoplasm, the disks have one or more incisures. Across vertebrates, the range of disk diameters spans an order of magnitude, and the number and length of the incisures vary considerably, but the mechanisms controlling disk architecture are not well understood. The finding that transgenic mice overexpressing rhodopsin have enlarged disks lacking an incisure prompted us to test whether lowered rhodopsin levels constrain <b>disk</b> <b>assembly.</b> The structure and function of rods from hemizygous rhodopsin knockout (R+/-) mice with decreased rhodopsin expression were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy and single cell recording. R+/- rods were structurally altered in three ways: disk shape changed from circular to elliptical, disk surface area decreased, and the single incisure lengthened to divide the disk into two sections. Photocurrent responses to flashes recovered more rapidly than normal. A spatially resolved model of phototransduction indicated that changes in the packing densities of rhodopsin and other transduction proteins were responsible. The decrease in aqueous outer segment volume and the lengthened incisure had only minor effects on photon response amplitude and kinetics. Rhodopsin availability limits <b>disk</b> <b>assembly</b> and outer segment girth in normal rods. The incisure may buffer the supply of structural proteins needed to form larger disks.
