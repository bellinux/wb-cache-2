40|$|Computer terms, IT terms, and loanwords in Japanese {{are most}} {{commonly}} written in katakana. Katakana characters are written with fewer strokes than kanji characters, and therefore provide fewer clues that help <b>in</b> recognizing <b>the</b> characters. Also, many katakana characters {{are similar in}} shape, so learners of Japanese tend to find katakana terms harder to learn. Yet as information technology continues to advance, {{the number of new}} IT terms proliferates. Beginning in 2003, compulsory courses in Information Technology were added to the regular non-vocational high school curriculum, and this inspired me to examine the IT terminology and katakana words used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> textbooks for these classes. I surveyed <b>the</b> vocabulary <b>in</b> 23 textbooks（ 3, 127 pages <b>in</b> all）used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> non-vocational high school Information Technology classes. More specifically, I extracted the IT terms listed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>indexes</b> of <b>the</b> textbooks, and compiled an IT terminology list. Next, I culled just the katakana terms from the list, and analyzed the characteristics of the katakana words. I found that 1 / 4 of all <b>the</b> IT terms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>indexes</b> of <b>the</b> textbooks were katakana terms. <b>In</b> comparing <b>the</b> three Information Technology classes （IT-A, IT-B, and IT-C ）, I also found a substantial difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number of“tokens per textbook” among the three classes. At the same time, I observed that the Information Technology A class tended to have fewer“types per textbook” than the Information Technology B class. This suggests that the Information Technology A class had fewer kinds of IT terms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>indexes</b> of <b>the</b> texts used <b>in</b> those classes compared to <b>the</b> textbooks use <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Information Technology B classes, and the types of terms missing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> IT-A classes were represented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>indexes</b> of textbooks used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other classes. And conversely, there were more kinds of IT terms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>indexes</b> of <b>the</b> IT-B class texts than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> IT-A class texts. <b>In</b> analyzing <b>the</b> IT terms found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>indexes</b> of at least 10 out of 23 textbooks, I discovered that katakana terms accounted for about half of all the IT terms. It is thus apparent that a great many of the high frequency IT terms found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>indexes</b> of many of the textbooks are katakana terms...|$|R
