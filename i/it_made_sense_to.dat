5|$|On , 1889, the Land Run saw the {{founding}} of Norman, with at least 150 residents spending the night in makeshift campsites; {{by the next morning}} a downtown was already being constructed. Almost immediately two prominent Norman businessmen, former Purcell railroad freight agent Delbert Larsh and railroad station chief cashier Thomas Waggoner, began lobbying for the territorial government to locate its first university in Norman. The two were interested in growing the city and had reasoned that, rather than try to influence legislatures to locate the heavily contested territory capital in Norman, <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> attempt to secure the state's first university instead (a move that would be far less controversial). On , 1890, Larsh and Waggoner were successful with the passage of Council Bill 114, establishing the University of Oklahoma in Norman approximately 18 years before Oklahoma statehood.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1991, however, falling {{inflation}} {{had reduced}} WMATA's construction costs {{so much that}} the agency said it could build the two final Green Line stations in Prince George's County without asking Congress for additional money. WMATA also proposed spending money almost three times faster up-front to accelerate its construction schedule, a move which would be more than compensated for by savings in out-years. Prince George's County officials threatened to block all further Metrorail construction unless they received guarantees that the stations in their county would be built. Funding for the remaining seven Green Line stations in the District and Prince George's remained in doubt as of August 1991, with District officials saying that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> build the Georgia Avenue – Petworth and Columbia Heights stations and Prince George's representatives demanding that the three stations in their county be completed. WMATA said that it had so little money it could not fund 16 critical small construction projects, among them security gates at the Navy Yard and Waterfront stations and parts for escalators at the seven new Green Line stations in D.C. and Prince George's County. The funding impasse was broken in November 1991 when local and state governments agreed to roughly triple their contribution to Metro's construction costs by 1994 to complete the entire system.|$|E

50|$|There {{was also}} another house, that was brown in color, called Kuruvilla {{that was later}} disbanded and {{students}} were distributed amongst the houses available since <b>it</b> <b>made</b> more <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> have four houses {{in order to keep}} competitions easier.|$|R

5|$|Eshiro {{said that}} they could have set the game in a {{courtroom}} {{similar to that of the}} main series and made a few additions, but that it would not have been very interesting; instead they moved the game to crime scenes, and added several new gameplay elements. Yamazaki was the one who came up with the idea of making a game about deductive reasoning and crime scene investigation. Because of this theme, <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> them to include the Ace Attorney character Ema Skye in the game, as she is portrayed as wanting to be a forensic scientist. Yamazaki originally suggested that Ema should be the main character, but based on fan feedback, they decided to use the more popular character Miles Edgeworth instead. Figuring out how to move the game from the courtroom to the crime scene was a challenge for the development team. The team also thought that it was difficult to make the game feel new while also making sure it felt similar to the game series. Because of the new gameplay systems that all had to be created from scratch, Ace Attorney Investigations took longer to develop than previous Ace Attorney games had.|$|E
5|$|The French {{scientists}} {{made good}} {{progress on the}} design of an aqueous homogeneous reactor, but there were doubts that their work was relevant to the main task of the British Tube Alloys project, that of building an atomic bomb, and resources were tightly controlled in wartime Britain. There was a possibility that a reactor could be used to breed plutonium, but its use in a bomb seemed a remote possibility. The MAUD Committee therefore felt that they should relocate to America. <b>It</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> pool resources, and America had advantages, notably access to materials such as heavy water. American scientists such as Henry D. Smyth, Harold Urey and Hugh Taylor urged that the Cambridge team be sent to America. On the other hand, American officials had concerns about security, since only one of the six senior scientists in the Cambridge group was British, and about French patent claims. These included patents on controlling nuclear chain reactions, enriching uranium, and using deuterium as a neutron moderator. There were also two patent applications in conjunction with Egon Bretscher and Norman Feather on the production and use of plutonium. George Thomson, the chairman of the MAUD Committee, suggested a compromise: relocating the team to Canada.|$|E

5000|$|New Zealand's {{economy was}} heavily {{dependent}} on overseas trade, and Prime Minister Norman Kirk felt that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> little <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> be dependent on foreign-owned shipping firms. A state-owned shipping line, Shipping Corporation of New Zealand was created, but was to be financially unsuccessful.|$|R

"When {{we decided}} to make an anime {{adaptation}} of the comic book, I couldn't see how a traditional animated approach would do justice to Anna's incredibly lush and detailed illustrations. <b>It</b> <b>made</b> perfect <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> adapt the medium to suit her art, rather than vice versa." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{business}} {{was bought by}} the United Steel Companies Limited (USC) on 29 June 1945. USC needed replacement locomotives so <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> buy a manufacturer (at the right price) and the idea had been put forward of developing a central engineering workshop for their steelworks at Templeborough (Rotherham) and Stocksbridge. Both works were being expanded and redeveloped, and were easily accessible by rail from the YEC works. In the post war climate, the YEC management were willing to sell.|$|E
25|$|During {{this early}} period of growth, Dome {{proposed}} {{to build a}} liquids recovery plant — in effect, a very large straddle plant — at the Empress, Alberta, delivery point to the TransCanada transmission line. The Empress plant sits just inside the Alberta/Saskatchewan border. This is for reasons related to both politics and infrastructure. Politically, Alberta wanted value to be added inside provincial borders. As importantly, <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> extract liquids before sending the dry gas that remained - unadulterated methane - into the export market.|$|E
25|$|Morey {{demonstrated}} his {{engine in}} New York and Philadelphia {{and there are}} eyewitness reports for both. In Philadelphia, he demonstrated it powering a boat and a wagon. Unfortunately, {{when he decided to}} demonstrate the car on the street, he fell off after starting the engine and the vehicle powered across Market Street into a ditch. This was the second car ride in the world, and the first in the United States. Despite these mostly successful demonstrations, Morey could not find a buyer, and became frustrated. A letter from Reverend Dana of Orford written in October 1829 tells of Morey’s trip to Baltimore, “I am told, the Capt. Is determined to make one more vigorous effort, to sell his patent right for some of his modern inventions , and if he does not now succeed, he will give the matter up, and return to Orford, to spend his days in quiet.” Morey did not find a buyer, and as he was then in his late 60s, <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> stop traveling {{up and down the east}} coast and call it quits.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the scene}} where Julia murders another man, the actor playing the victim felt that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> for him <b>to</b> do so naked. The nude murder scene was shot but, ultimately, {{replaced}} with a semi-clothed version.|$|R
50|$|Despite its {{aspirational}} positioning in the marketplace, the Isabella had {{a smaller}} engine (and was marginally shorter) than its immediate predecessor, the Borgward Hansa. Late in 1952, {{the firm had}} launched their six-cylinder Hansa 2400 model. The larger car never found many buyers; but in 1954, <b>it</b> <b>made</b> commercial <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> keep the two models from competing too directly with each other.|$|R

It said: [...] "You are killing a (sic) innocent man today." [...] Shortly after signing Chandler's death warrant Governor Rick Scott said: [...] " [...] killed three women, so I looked through different cases, and <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> do that one. There's never one thing. It was the right case." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1873, Congress {{had passed}} a Coinage Act that {{regulated}} which coins were legal tender. [...] The list of legal coins duplicated {{that of the}} previous coinage act, leaving off only the silver dollar and three smaller coins. [...] The rationale in the Treasury report accompanying the draft bill was that to mint a gold dollar and a silver dollar with different intrinsic values was problematic; as the silver dollar did not circulate and the gold did, <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> drop the unused coin. The bill passed easily, with Bayard's support, but quickly thereafter became unpopular. [...] Opponents of the bill would later call this omission the [...] "Crime of '73," [...] and would mean it literally, circulating tales of bribery of Congressmen by foreign agents.|$|E
500|$|In July 2006, as Casino Royale entered post-production, Eon Productions {{announced}} that the next film {{would be based on}} an original idea by producer Michael G. Wilson. In June 2007 Marc Forster was confirmed as director. He was surprised that he was approached for the job, stating he was not a big Bond film fan through the years, and that he would not have accepted the project had he not seen Casino Royale prior to making his decision: he felt Bond had been humanised in that film, arguing that because travelling the world had become less exotic since the series' advent, <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> focus more on Bond as a character. Forster found Casino Royales 144-minute running time too long, and wanted his follow-up to be [...] "tight and fast... like a bullet".|$|E
50|$|Most serial digital {{interfaces}} use {{a separate}} clock pin {{to signal the}} arrival of individual bits of data. However, Wozniak decided that a separate wire for a clock signal was not necessary; and as ADB {{was designed to be}} low-cost, <b>it</b> <b>made</b> economical <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> leave <b>it</b> out. Like modems, the system locks onto the signal rise and fall times to recreate a clock signal.|$|R

In an interview he described the cause of his [...] "infection" [...] for electronic music and DJ-ing: [...] "I'd never really liked house music up until then, but this was kind of different, because it had the hip-hop element through the breakbeats, <b>it</b> <b>made</b> total <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> me".|$|R
5000|$|Peterlić did {{not return}} to directing, and Accidental Life {{remained}} his only feature film. As his academic career was taking off, he felt that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> no <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> pursue film directing, a field in which his contributions were not appreciated. Ultimately, Peterlić came to be best known for his scholarly work, which earned him the title of the [...] "father of Croatian film studies".|$|R

Born in Germany and raised in Switzerland, Forster was the first Bond director not to come from the British Commonwealth of Nations, although he noted Bond's mother is Swiss, making him somewhat appropriate to handle the British icon. The director collaborated strongly with Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, noting they only blocked two very expensive ideas he had. The director found Casino Royales 144-minute running time too long, and wanted his follow-up to be [...] "tight and fast... like a bullet." ...|$|E
500|$|Santer {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} a [...] "parallel universe show" [...] with new characters, where the regular characters are in the background. Yorke sought to improve the portrayal of teenagers in EastEnders and to get younger people writing for it. The ideas came together and EastEnders: E20 was created in what Yorke described as [...] "one of the quickest periods from idea to screen I've ever known." [...] Regarding the decision to create an online drama, Yorke said, [...] "People don't watch television at fixed times anymore, they use iPlayer [...] get it at their convenience and so <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> make a programme that [...] can specifically get at their convenience." [...] The show's producer, Deborah Sathe, added, [...] "Technology is changing and it's changing really quickly and I think it's really appropriate that the BBC is leading the way in offering online content." [...] The first series was commissioned by multi-platform commissioning executive Rosie Allimonos.|$|E
500|$|By 1972, Deep Purple had {{achieved}} considerable commercial success in Japan, including several hit singles, so <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> tour there. Three dates were booked; the Festival Hall, Osaka on 11 and 12 May, and the Budokan, Tokyo on 16 August, though these were later changed to the 15 and 16 August, and 17 August respectively {{due to an}} earlier US tour being rescheduled. The dates sold out almost immediately, and consequently the Japanese arm of the band's label, Warner Bros. Records, wanted to record the tour for a live album {{to be released in}} the country. The band eventually agreed to the idea, but insisted {{if it was going to}} be released, they wanted it to be done properly. Gillan recalled, [...] "we said we would have to OK the equipment, we wanted to use our own engineer and we would have the last say on whether the tapes were released". The band enlisted producer Martin Birch, who had worked on previous studio albums, to record the shows onto an 8-track recorder so they could subsequently be mixed.|$|E
50|$|It was {{realised}} that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> little <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> {{keep the}} two lines separate, and a Joint Committee had been formed in March 1862—the L&CR had three {{members to the}} LLUC's two. Through tolls from Caradon to Looe were published, and operational management of the two railways passed to the L&CR from 31 March 1862. The L&CR acquired the locomotive Liskeard, paying the LLUC the £600 it had paid for it.|$|R
50|$|York North {{was opened}} by the North Eastern Railway in 1878 {{the year after}} the current York station was opened. With the re-location of the station outside of the city walls, <b>it</b> <b>made</b> {{operational}} <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> have an engine shed {{at the north end of}} the station as many trains changed locomotives at York. It also had good access to the freight yards and the carriage sheds located at Clifton.|$|R
50|$|The main {{motivation}} for VA API is to enable hardware-accelerated video decode at various entry-points (VLD, IDCT, motion compensation, deblocking) for the prevailing coding standards today (MPEG-2, MPEG-4 ASP/H.263, MPEG-4 AVC/H.264, H.265/HEVC, and VC-1/WMV3). Extending XvMC was considered, {{but due to}} its original design for MPEG-2 MotionComp only, <b>it</b> <b>made</b> more <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> design an interface from scratch that can fully expose the video decode capabilities in today's GPUs.|$|R
500|$|Wirkola said, [...] "I have {{a strong}} memory from my {{childhood}} of just how dark and gruesome their tale was and I wondered {{what would have happened}} to the two of them when they grew up? They had this dark past and this intense hatred of witches. So as I thought about it, <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> me that of course they would be fated to become great witch hunters. We wanted it to feel like this could be happening 300 years ago but at the same time, there is a modern spin on all the action, characters and weaponry. It was a fun way to make a classical world feel fresh." [...] Wirkola said that he originally came with that idea in 2007 while studying film and television at Bond University in Australia, when he wanted to make it as just a short film, and that the film school director Simon Hunter advised him: [...] "Tom, don't ever speak of the idea again until you are in front of a Hollywood producer and I guarantee you will sell it." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewing {{the series}} as a whole, Santos found it uneven, {{with the story}} {{elements}} ranging from being [...] "brilliant jaw-droppers" [...] to feeling unfinished, giving the revelation of Takumi's true nature {{as an example of}} the former, and the conclusions to some character sub-plots as examples of the latter. Luke Carroll at ANN and John Rose at The Fandom Post were critical of the story, saying that while its ideas and the question of what is and isn't real was interesting, the story felt rushed, with the game's narrative [...] "squeezed" [...] into too few episodes. Rose additionally was disappointed in how the answers felt less innovative than the mysteries originally seemed. The story was criticized by several reviewers as feeling confusing, with Bradley Meek at T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews finding it confusing enough to quit watching after the eighth episode, and Erin Finnegan at ANN calling it unwatchable due to how little <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> them, despite a promising start. Chris Homer and Chris Beveridge, both at The Fandom Post, found the story engaging, however, with the latter calling the climax [...] "solid".|$|E
500|$|During the 1850s, {{large-scale}} {{works were}} undertaken in Estonia to transform excessively wet land into land suitable for agriculture; this included the digging of drainage ditches. In the process, previously unknown layers of oil shale {{were discovered in}} several locations. In the years 1850–1857, the territory of Estonia was explored by the Baltic German geologist Carl Friedrich Schmidt who studied these findings of oil shale. [...] Russian chemist Aleksandr Shamarin, who {{at the end of}} the 1860s had studied the composition and properties of oil shale originating from the Kukruse area, concluded <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> use oil shale for the production of gas and as a solid fuel. However, he considered shale oil production unprofitable. [...] During the remainder of the 19th century oil shale was used locally as a low-grade fuel only. For example, in the 1870s, Robert von Toll, landlord of the Kukruse Manor, started to use oil shale as a fuel for the manor's distillery. There were failed attempts to use graptolitic argillite as fertilizer in the 19th century. In the beginning of the 20th century, geologist and engineer Carl August von Mickwitz studied self-ignition of graptolitic argillite near Paldiski. At the University of Tartu oil shale geology and chemistry analyses were conducted during the 19th century by Georg Paul Alexander Petzholdt, Alexander Gustav von Schrenk, and Carl Ernst Heinrich Schmidt, among others.|$|E
50|$|Alaska's {{transportation}} infrastructure {{at the time}} was so limited and the problem of military supply so acute, <b>it</b> also <b>made</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> concentrate the bases along existing supply lines near Anchorage and Fairbanks. Ladd's location near Fairbanks, the Richardson Highway and the Alaska Railroad, its access to fuel from the CANOL pipeline, and its position at the time as one of the United States' northernmost developed airbases were important factors in securing its early Cold War prominence.|$|R
