25|$|Strobe lights usually use flashtubes {{with energy}} {{supplied}} from a capacitor, an energy storage device {{much like a}} battery, but capable of charging and releasing energy much faster. Recently, some strobe lights {{have been found to}} use rectified mains electricity and no capacitors at all. In a capacitor-based strobe light, the capacitor is charged up to around 300 V. Once the capacitor has been charged, a small amount of power is diverted into a trigger transformer, a small transformer with a high turns ratio. This generates the weak but high voltage spike required to ionize the xenon gas in a flash tube. An arc is created inside the tube, which acts as a bridge for the much bigger pulse to flow down later. Arcs present almost a <b>direct</b> <b>short</b> circuit, allowing the capacitors to quickly release their energy into the arc. This rapidly heats the xenon gas, creating an extremely bright plasma discharge, which is seen as a flash.|$|E

Cagney had long been told by friends that he would make an {{excellent}} director, so when he was approached by his friend, producer A. C. Lyles, he instinctively said yes. He refused all offers of payment, saying he was an actor, not a director. The film was low budget, and shot quickly. As Cagney recalled, [...] "We shot it in twenty days, and that was long enough for me. I find directing a bore, I have no desire to tell other people their business".|$|E
