5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows that you might start in a war with certain things on your mind as a purpose {{of what you are}} doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you had never thought of before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E
500|$|For {{her fourth}} album, The House (2010), Melua worked with {{producer}} William Orbit. She {{said about the}} experience: [...] "The whole thing has been really exciting. It was the same feeling I had the first time I went skydiving. I was really quite nervous, but I knew all I {{had to do was}} let myself go and it was going to feel amazing. I wasn't {{trying to get away from}} anything. It was more about going towards something. I wanted the music to be inspired by the future, something unknown that's never been heard before, but at the same time hold on to the values of the music of the past, to try and tap into something that's so ancient and old that it's kind of forgotten. I thought that, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> far enough in both directions, we could end up in the same place".|$|E
2500|$|The day after, I {{asked my}} pilot, a cheerful young New Zealander, {{if he thought}} we really needed an escort. He said that, unless we had bad luck, he could {{probably}} get away from anything except a very up-to-date fighter. [...] I {{asked him if he}} would get into trouble <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> without an escort. He replied cheerfully that, if we came back safely, no one would say anything, and if we didn't, it wouldn't matter anyway. This seemed sound enough logic, and so we sent off a signal to Robin, announcing our arrival, and set off on our own.|$|E

2500|$|Taylor {{was profoundly}} deaf and communicated on-field with his {{teammates}} in sign language. [...] He {{is credited with}} helping to expand and make universal the use of sign language throughout the modern baseball infield, including {{but not limited to}} the use of pitching signs. [...] According to Sean Lahman in his biography of Taylor, [...] "The Giants didn't just add Taylor to their roster; they embraced him {{as a member of the}} family. [...] Player-manager George Davis learned sign language and encouraged his players to do the same. [...] John McGraw did likewise when he took over as Giants manager in July 1902." [...] In Lawrence Ritter's The Glory of Their Times, Taylor's teammate, Fred Snodgrass, recalled:We could all read and speak the deaf-and-dumb sign language, because Dummy Taylor took it as an affront if you didn't learn to converse with him. [...] He wanted to be one of us, to be a full-fledged member of the team. [...] <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> to the vaudeville show, he wanted to know what the joke was, and somebody had to tell him. [...] So we all learned. [...] We practiced all the time.|$|E
2500|$|In the Preliminary Final against Sydney FC, the Phoenix lost 4–2 in {{controversial}} circumstances. After {{being locked}} at 1–1 through goals from Chris Payne for Sydney and Andrew Durante for Wellington, Payne apparently missed a header and deflected {{the ball into}} the goal off his hand. Andrew Durante, who was marking Payne went straight over to the linesman, but the goal stood. [...] "I went straight to the linesman. I knew 100 per cent it was handball. I spoke to the ref at halftime about it and he said it wasn't deliberate. It's pretty funny that one. Such a big game and such a big occasion, for something like that to change the game is very disappointing." [...] Sydney FC strikers Alex Brosque and Mark Bridge both scored break-away goals as Phoenix pushed forward. Eugene Dadi then added a late consolation goal. Phoenix striker Chris Greenacre said that it changed the dynamics of the game. [...] "It just rips the heart out of you. We got back in the game with a good goal and that takes it away from you. It wasn't to be. I think we were right back in it. They played some good football but I thought we had withstood it OK. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> into halftime [...] we were really confident we could get something out of it." [...] Coach Ricki Herbert echoed those statements. The loss brought the end to the Phoenix's season, meaning that Melbourne Victory and Sydney FC would compete in the Grand Final.|$|E
