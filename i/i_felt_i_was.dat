25|$|The {{sense of}} {{something}} being missing on Aliens was greater {{for me than}} on The Abyss, where the film just got consistently better as the cut got along. The film must function as a dramatic, organic whole. When I cut the film together, things that read well on paper, on a conceptual level, didn't necessarily translate to the screen as well. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> losing something by breaking my focus. Breaking the story's focus and coming off the main characters was a far greater detriment to the film than what was gained. The film keeps the same message intact at a thematic level, not at a really overt level, by working in a symbolic way.|$|E
500|$|Considering what to write, Carrier {{thought of}} his own childhood. He stated in an {{interview}} that he began thinking of [...] "when was it that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> really myself? And I remember it was when I put on my skates and my Eaton catalogues on my legs, and I stood up, and I was taller than my mom, and I had a stick in my hands, so I was stronger than my brother, and I felt that I was little me. So I started to write about that and it turned into the Hockey Sweater story." ...|$|E
500|$|On February 19, 2010, Woods gave a {{televised}} statement {{in which he}} said he had been in a 45-day therapy program since the end of December. He again apologized for his actions. [...] "I thought I could get away with whatever I wanted to," [...] he said. [...] "I felt that I had worked hard my entire life and deserved to enjoy all the temptations around me. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> entitled. Thanks to money and fame, I didn't have to go far to find them. I was wrong. I was foolish." [...] He {{said he did not know}} yet when he would be returning to golf. He announced a few weeks later on March 16 that he would be returning at the 2010 Masters Tournament on April 8.|$|E

500|$|Four screenwriters {{worked on}} the property. Peter Hedges wrote the first draft, but didn't think he could do more; another writer passed. Paul Rudnick did some work on Miranda's scenes, {{followed}} by a Don Roos rewrite. After that, Aline Brosh McKenna, {{who was able to}} relate her own youthful experiences attempting to launch a journalism career in New York to the story, produced a draft after a month's work that struck the right balance for Finerman and Frankel, whose notes were incorporated into a final version, rearranging the plot significantly, following the book less closely and focusing the story on the conflict between Andrea and Miranda. She found the experience of writing a story with female protagonists that did not center around a relationship [...] "very liberating ... <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> allowed to do what the movie wanted to be, a Faust story, a Wall Street for ladies." ...|$|E
500|$|She then won a {{supporting}} role in the futuristic 1995 film Tank Girl, winning the role of [...] "Jet Girl" [...] after nine auditions. While the film was met with mixed reviews, it flopped at the box office, although it {{has gone on to}} become something of a cult classic. Throughout the rest of the decade, she took mostly supporting roles in films and occasionally considered leaving the business, but: [...] "there were always little bites. Whenever <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{at the end of my}} rope, something would come up. Something bad. But for me it was 'work begets work'; that was my motto." [...] In 1996, she starred alongside Joe Mantegna, Kelly Lynch and J.T. Walsh in George Hickenlooper's action-thriller Persons Unknown; alongside James Earl Jones, Kevin Kilner and Ellen Burstyn in the period drama Timepiece; in Bermuda Triangle, a TV pilot that was not picked up for a full series, where she played a former documentary filmmaker who disappears in the Bermuda Triangle; and as the lead role in , in which children in a small town become possessed under the command of a wrongfully murdered child preacher.|$|E
500|$|By 1962, Glock {{had persuaded}} the BBC {{management}} {{to increase the}} orchestra's budget to allow for joint principals in the string sections, to attract top musicians who could play in the BBC SO without having {{to give up their}} solo or chamber careers. The following season, he was able to engage joint principals for the wind section, including as Jack Brymer and Terence MacDonagh, formerly members of Beecham's celebrated [...] "Royal Family" [...] in the RPO. The problem remained that recruiting rank-and-file string players was difficult: although the BBC offered secure employment and a pension, it did not pay as well as its London rivals. After 1964, the BBC SO {{was the only one of}} the five London symphony orchestras that was not self-governed, and some musicians felt that the BBC SO's constitution as a body of salaried employees, with no say in the management or repertory of the orchestra, attracted an unadventurous type of player. A former member of the BBC SO said in 1979, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> getting too secure ... the BBC Symphony you can be a poor player, but if you're on time and never moan at the conductor … you'll have no trouble... I think the BBC Symphony lost some good young players because the management got their priorities wrong.|$|E

500|$|The 1973–74 NBA {{season was}} to be West's last as a player. Now 36 years old, the veteran guard {{averaged}} 20.3points, 3.7rebounds and 6.6assists per game. In two newly introduced statistics, steals and blocks, he was credited with 2.6 steals and 0.7 blocks per game. Despite playing only 31 games due to a strained groin, West was still regarded as an elite guard, earning another callup into his final All-Star Game. Without Chamberlain, who had ended his NBA career, the Lakers won 47 games and lost in five games to the Milwaukee Bucks. After this loss, West retired due to contract disagreements with Cooke, and filed a suit for unpaid back wages. West wanted to re-negotiate his contract and keep playing, however he said Cooke [...] "basically told my agent to go to hell. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> deceived. When you feel that you’re deceived you don’t {{want any part of}} the organization that deceived you. I could’ve played another very good year. Every athlete says that. But I could’ve, and I knew I could’ve. But I could never have played for the Lakers again, and I wasn’t going to play for anybody else." [...] At the time of his departure, West had scored more points than any Laker in NBA history.|$|E

"crags and pinnacles {{of naked}} rock, the dark cores of ancient volcanoes, {{a vast and}} silent {{emptiness}} smoldering with heat, color, and indecipherable significance, above which floated {{a small number of}} pure, clear, hard-edged clouds.

[...] "I had never been comfortable with my looks and felt I had lost the only person who loved me unconditionally", Garrison told the British Observer Sport Monthly in 2006. [...] "The pressure of being labeled 'the next Althea Gibson' only made things worse. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> never going to be allowed to grow into just becoming me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Indian singer Asha Puthli {{recorded}} [...] "I Dig Love", {{creating a}} version that Jon Pareles of The New York Times describes as [...] "a wild, post-psychedelic artifact, complete with sound effects, soul horns and Ms. Puthli alternately breathy and giggling". The recording appeared on her self-titled debut album, released in 1973. Speaking to Pareles in 2006, Puthli {{explained that she}} had viewed Harrison's reading of [...] "I Dig Love" [...] as a [...] "spiritual song", adding: [...] "They did it like a bhajan, an Indian religious song. In 1973, when I did it, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> already Indian, and the spirituality was inside me. I was trying to become Western, so I brought out the material aspect, the sexual aspect." [...] In 2005, Puthli's recording was sampled on the Kano track [...] "Reload It".|$|E
2500|$|Koop {{was active}} in {{publishing}} articles in the medical literature. [...] Koop later wrote that Each day of those early years in pediatric surgery <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> on the cutting edge. [...] Some of the surgical problems that landed {{on the operating table}} at Children's had not even been named. [...] Many of the operations I performed had never been done before. [...] It was an exuberant feeling, but also a little scary. [...] At times I was troubled by fears that I wasn't doing things the right way, that I would have regrets, or that someone else had performed a certain procedure successfully but had never bothered to write it up for the medical journals, or if they had I couldn't find it. [...] Koop helped rectify this by publishing his own findings and results. [...] Additionally, he became the first editor of the Journal of Pediatric Surgery when it was founded in 1966.|$|E
2500|$|An episode takes {{approximately}} {{one year to}} complete; Neely states that six or seven episodes may be produced simultaneously, all at various stages. Animation is done at Titmouse, Inc. in Los Angeles. When asked about the slideshow presentation of his animated shorts {{in an interview with}} The College Hill Independent, Neely felt that the approach was not [...] "an aesthetic choice, it was sort of the only thing I was able to do. I'm not an animator." [...] He stated that, out of [...] "ignorance and not having a whole lot of options", he hand-drew each frame on paper and scanned them into a computer; he felt the restrictions [...] "really paid off and I enjoyed the form. ... But, it never was something <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> needing to defend or stick to, or that it represented me artistically." [...] Other changes to the art style from the shorts were dictated by animation director, Mike L. Mayfield. Weidenfeld stated that Mayfield [...] "was instrumental in turning Brad's original style into what we had the first season." [...] Among them were the addition of pupils which, according to Weidenfeld, some of Neely's fans were unhappy over. Neely states that [...] "I had a long run of drawing those Orphan Annie style of eyes. That worked well for print. But as soon as things move, the characters start to look like zombies." ...|$|E
