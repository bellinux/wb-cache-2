5|$|Marseille {{developed}} his own special tactics, which differed {{significantly from the}} methods of most other pilots. (When attacking a Lufbery circle) he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> very slowly. He even {{took it to the}} point where he had to operate his landing flaps as not to fall down, because, of course he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> his curve (turns) more tightly than the upper defensive circle. He and his fighter were one unit, and he was in command of that aircraft like no-one else.|$|E
5|$|The {{complete}} pilot's course initially lasted six months, {{split into}} two months each of elementary, intermediate and advanced instruction. Ground subjects were also taught and each trainee <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> at least 150 hours to qualify. By {{the end of the}} war each period had been shortened by a week to speed up the output of trained pilots.|$|E
5|$|The most {{dangerous}} {{part of the}} operation was over by 02:15. The intruders had spent over an hour in British airspace. Now the journey back over the sea to Germany and the Netherlands was undertaken. The British had jammed German radio beacons and switched on others with the same frequency. It was hoped the move would fool German pilots into landing in Britain in error. Experienced pilots did not fall for the ruse. Still, they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> over the sea by dead reckoning. A consequence of this showed that while around only five Ju 88s were lost in combat over England, eight crews were missing, three were killed in crash-landings and had died from their injuries, six crews had baled out 11 aircraft crashed or were damaged on landing.|$|E
50|$|A {{particular}} difficulty {{faced by the}} team was the side-by-side seating arrangement in the Kiran cockpits. The members flying {{to the left of}} the leader <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> from the right seat, whereas the left seat is the master seat. Therefore, some aircraft <b>have</b> been modified <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> solo from the right seat. In unmodified aircraft, the pilot flying on the left of the leader <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> in two pilot configuration.|$|R

5|$|Van der Byl {{took over}} {{at a time when}} South Africa was putting {{increasing}} pressure on the Rhodesians to make an agreement on majority rule. In March 1975, he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> urgently to Cape Town to explain why the Rhodesian government had detained Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole of the Zimbabwe African National Union, who was accused of plotting against other black nationalist leaders. The South Africans were extremely displeased with this action and suspected that the real reason was that the Rhodesians objected to Sithole and preferred to negotiate with Joshua Nkomo. Van der Byl was unsuccessful in reassuring the South Africans and Ian Smith was forced to follow him.|$|E
5|$|By April 1943, Western Area {{controlled}} four combat units: No.14 Squadron, flying Bristol Beaufort reconnaissance-bombers out of Pearce; No.25 Squadron, {{tasked with}} dive-bombing missions in Wirraways based at Pearce; No.76 Squadron, flying P-40 Kittyhawks out of Potshot (Exmouth Gulf); and No.85 Squadron, operating CAC Boomerang fighters from Pearce. The area command was {{also able to}} call on US Navy Catalinas of Patrol Wing10, based at Crawley, for reconnaissance and anti-submarine missions. The Beauforts and Catalinas flew several hundred maritime patrols during 1943. In March 1944, Western Area went on high alert in response to concerns that a Japanese naval force would raid Western Australia. Perth was reinforced with Nos.452 and 457 Squadrons, and Exmouth Gulf with Nos.18, 31, and 120 Squadrons, but no attack ensued and the units were directed {{to return to their}} home bases. The US Navy withdrew Patrol Wing10 mid-year, curtailing Western Area's ability to conduct long-range maritime reconnaissance; No.14 Squadron's fifteen serviceable Beauforts <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> patrols of up to twenty-two hours in duration to search for German submarines reported in the area. As of 31May 1944, Western Area headquarters staff numbered 686, including 118 officers.|$|E
5|$|In the {{qualifier}} round, in atrocious {{conditions the}} Crusaders defeated the Highlanders 17-0. The game was notable for the Crusaders defence, which kept the highly-talented Highlanders scoreless. The Crusaders then defeated the Chiefs comfortably 27-13, repaying earlier playoff losses to the team. The Crusaders faced the Lions in the final, and {{owing to the}} Lions holding home advantage, <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> nearly 12,000km. The Crusaders confronted a daunting task to win the 2017 title. The Crusaders would have to battle a formidable Lions team, altitude and 61,000 Lions fans in the fortress of Ellis Park Stadium. The Crusaders started strongly with two tries, jumping out to a 12-0 lead. In the 38th minute Kwagga Smith took out David Havili in the air, causing Havili to fall dangerously. Smith was given a red card. At half time the Crusaders led 15-3. Kieran Read scored a try immediately after half time to extend the lead to 22-3. However, the travel, altitude and fast pace of the game took a toll on the Crusaders. The attacking Lions scored two tries {{to reduce the deficit}} to 25-17. But the defence of the Crusaders held out giving the Crusaders a record eighth title 25-17, while avenging last years result.|$|E

5|$|Militants {{of unknown}} {{affiliation}} fired rockets at United Nations World Food Program (UNWFP) planes on 8 June near Luena and again near Kuito {{a few days}} later. As the first plane, a Boeing 727, approached Luena someone shot a missile at the aircraft, damaging one engine but not critically as the three-man crew landed successfully. The plane's altitude, , most likely prevented the assailant from identifying his target. As the citizens of Luena had enough food to last them several weeks, the UNFWP temporarily suspended their flights. When the flights began again a few days later, militants shot at a plane flying to Kuito, the first attack targeting UN workers since 1999. The UNWFP again suspended food aid flights throughout the country. While he did not claim responsibility for the attack, UNITA spokesman Justino said the planes carried weapons and soldiers rather than food, making them acceptable targets. UNITA and the Angolan government both said the international community needed to pressure the other side into returning to the negotiating table. Despite the looming humanitarian crisis, neither side guaranteed UNWFP planes safety. Kuito, which had relied on international aid, only had enough food to feed their population of 200,000 {{until the end of}} the week. The UNFWP <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> in all aid to Kuito and the rest of the Central Highlands because militants ambushed trucks. Further complicating the situation, potholes in the Kuito airport strip slowed aid deliveries. Overall chaos reduced the amount of available oil to the point at which the UN had to import its jet fuel.|$|E
25|$|Until Continental Airlines began nonstop {{flights to}} Lagos from George Bush Intercontinental Airport in November 2011, many Nigerians <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> through Europe to travel between Texas and Nigeria. Jenalia Moreno of the Houston Chronicle {{said that the}} Nigerian {{community}} and the energy companies in Houston have worked {{for a long time}} to get a flight to Nigeria from this city. In 2016 United Airlines canceled the Lagos route, citing a decline in the energy industry and inability to get currency out of Nigeria.|$|E

Later in the year during England's tour to Pakistan, Younis' eldest brother, Mohammed Sharif Khan, who in Younis's words, taught him to play cricket, died aged 41 in a car {{accident}} in Ukraine. Another older brother, Farman Ali Khan was only 39 when he was {{killed in a car accident}} in Germany in December 2006.|$|E

25|$|Norwegian ships {{continued}} to use the Danish civil ensign distinguished with the national arms in the canton north of Cape Finisterre, but <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> the Swedish civil ensign in the Mediterranean {{to be protected from}} pirate attacks. A common civil ensign for both countries was introduced in 1818, on the pattern of the naval ensign, but square-cut. This flag was optional for Swedish vessels, but compulsory for Norwegian ones in distant waters. In 1821, Norway adopted a new national civil ensign, identical to the present flag of Norway.|$|E
25|$|On December 17, 1973, in {{the wake}} of the events {{surrounding}} Pan Am Flight 110, a parked Lufthansa Boeing 737–100 (registered D-ABEY) was hijacked at Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport in Rome. 10 Italian hostages that had been taken by Palestinian terrorists at the airport were forced into the aircraft by 5 perpetrators, and the German crew (2 pilots and 2 flight attendants) that was on board preparing the departure to Munich <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> the aircraft instead first to Athens and then to several other airports, until the ordeal ended at Kuwait International Airport the next day, where the hijackers surrendered.|$|E

In November 1954, a checkup {{revealed}} that the master had long been inflicted with pulmonary tuberculosis. His lungs were calcified and the tracheae were abnormal. He needed to receive immediate medical treatment and get adequate rest. Still, he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> to the Philippines to give a series of lectures. When he finally returned to Taiwan, five months had passed. The trip took a heavy toll on his health. He barely {{had the strength to}} eat or talk. However, when people came to him with questions on Buddhism, he would summon his strength and answer spiritedly.|$|E

25|$|The Germans {{viewed the}} British naval {{withdrawal}} and suspension of merchant traffic {{as a success}} {{but the lack of}} targets for the Germans, eliminated the need for Fighter Command to engage the Luftwaffe over the Channel. The Germans now <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> into southern England, which put the Bf109, the best German fighter, at the limit of its endurance. Hitler's Directive No. 17 expanded the scope of the air offensive from the English Channel to British airfields. When Göring held a meeting with the OKL staff at The Hague on 1 August, he emphasised the need for German fighters to conserve fuel, which remained a severe handicap for the Germans.|$|E
25|$|Over Aachen flak burst around them, {{hitting the}} Fw 190 of Oberleutnant Hans Fielder, {{adjutant}} of III./JG 11. He had rejoined his group {{the previous day}} from Göttingen, force-landing on 23 December due to engine trouble, and was grounded. He was not expecting {{to participate in this}} operation but <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> with a brand new Fw 190A-8 as the wingman for Oberleutnant Grosser, Staffelkapitän of 11./JG 11. A lone P-47 shot at him and a result of both flak hits and P-47 fire Fielder was wounded in the head and forced to crash-land becoming a POW.

25|$|In March 1995, Coast Air started {{flights from}} Sørstokken to Stavanger using a Twin Otter {{four times a}} week. However, the route did not have {{sufficient}} patronage and was terminated in June. In November 1995, Widerøe stated that {{they were willing to}} fly from Sørstokken to Oslo, in cooperation with Air Stord, using de Havilland Canada Dash 8 aircraft, with 37 or 50 seats. This would allow increased capacity without extending the runway. During March and April 1996, Sørstokken had its first regular helicopter flights, operated by Norsk Helikopter, as Aker had been contracted to dismount the oil platform at Odin. The company <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> out personnel in the morning and take them back in the evening.

25|$|The two Allied columns {{advanced}} towards Djebel Abiod and Beja, {{under attack}} from the Luftwaffe, which had local air superiority, because Allied aircraft <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> from distant bases in Algeria. On the northern road, the leading elements of the 36th Brigade made rapid progress until 17 November, when they met a mixed force of 17 tanks, 400 paratroops and self-propelled guns at Djebel Abiod. The British knocked out eleven tanks but having no tank support, were held up for nine days. The Allied columns concentrated at Djebel Abiod and Beja, preparing for an assault on 24 November. The 36th Brigade (Brigadier A.L. Kent-Lemon) was to advance from Djebel Abiod towards Mateur and 11th Brigade was to move down {{the valley of the}} river Merjerda, to take Majaz al Bab (also Medjez el Bab or Medjez) and thence to Tebourba, Djedeida and Tunis.|$|E
25|$|The {{border patrol}} mission started with DH-4s and Curtiss JN-4 Jennies, with both {{eventually}} replaced with updated Dayton-Wright DH-4Bs. Most {{of the first}} planes were not properly equipped for field service. Not knowing what turn events on the border might take, the Army wanted the planes ready for any eventuality. Colonel James E. Fechet, Air Service Officer at the Southern Department, found it no easy task to obtain bomb racks, machine gun mounts, cameras, and other equipment. There was a delay, for example, in installing synchronized Martin guns because parts supplied with the guns did not fit the planes on the border. The radios on some planes could send only in code and could not do that very well. Compasses were unreliable, maps sketchy and of little use. The country over which the men <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> was wild and rough and sparsely populated, with few places for safe emergency landings.|$|E
25|$|The HUSKY mission on 11 July was {{far less}} successful. The 144 C-47s of the 52nd Troop Carrier Wing that took part <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> at night over the front line. Moreover, Allied naval vessels had not been cleared from the {{approach}} corridor. The troop carriers came under heavy flak from friend and foe alike. Some 23 aircraft were lost and half of those that did return suffered damage. The paratroops of the 504th Parachute Infantry were widely scattered and suffered heavy casualties. A mission codenamed Operation FUSTIAN, flown on 13 July {{in support of the}} British, cost 11 C-47s destroyed and 50 damaged out of 124 participating. After the costly failures in Sicily, Lieutenant General Lesley J. McNair, the commander of Army Ground Forces, was prepared to break up the airborne divisions, but Williams retained his faith in the possibilities of airborne operations.|$|E
