25|$|In September 2015, {{the mills}} {{were open to}} the public as part of the Open House London weekend in which {{visitors}} were able to tour the sixth floor of the East wing, tenth floor of the main building, the East roof top and the Rank Hovis mill. As of September 2015, the Millennium Mills have been cleared of internal machinery and grain chutes which posed an asbestos risk, though the removed artefacts are planned to be donated to artists to use. A two-storey pavilion on the roof is planned to be removed {{to make way for a}} rooftop bar and restaurant. The concrete East wing stub is planned to be demolished as well as large parts of the south facing fall being removed and replaced. Plans to redeveloped the adjacent Rank Hovis mill are not currently finalised due to its higher rate of decay and architectural significance. Currently, the last remaining <b>grain</b> <b>chute</b> on site resides in the Rank Hovis Mill.|$|E
50|$|On {{the upper}} level, the bay {{to the east}} has a three section grain bin. This bin {{corresponds}} {{to the size of}} the animal pen below and does not extend to the roof above. Each compartment has a <b>grain</b> <b>chute</b> from the upper to the lower level. A walkway provides access to the large hay doors and makes the moving of the hay and straw easier. Most of the upper level is open for the storage of hay and straw.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{problems}} Britain suffered during the previous winter with snow, and local authorities not having the {{money to spend on}} road clearing equipment, the presenters {{came up with the idea}} of the Snowbine Harvester to save money, working on the theory combine harvesters were sitting idle during winter months so were readily available with a cheap conversion kit. The team fitted a snowplough to the front of a used Claas Dominator. It was also converted to a gritter using the <b>grain</b> <b>chute,</b> capable of blasting grit through the windows of nearby cars. A flamethrower was fitted at the rear, operated by Jeremy, and a Bovril boiler in the cab for James to counter the lack of heating. During testing in Norway, the team blasted grit through a house window, set fire to a man and ran into a car hidden by snow. They then successfully ploughed a road that had not previously been ploughed that winter.|$|E
5000|$|Three Mills, a mill {{complex on}} the east bank of the River Lee. A trading site for nearly a {{thousand}} years, the House Mill was built in 1776 and was (and remains) the country's largest tide mill. It has been restored and contains much of its original machinery including four large waterwheels, millstones and <b>grain</b> <b>chutes.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{is a set}} of {{belt-driven}} elevators, {{remarkable for}} its time, that moved the <b>grains</b> from <b>chutes</b> to hoppers, and even from floor to floor, making the mill almost fully automatic. Most other mills required workers to hand shovel materials between operations.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "grain auger" [...] {{is used in}} {{agriculture}} to move grain from trucks, grain carts or grain trailers into grain storage bins (from where it is later removed by gravity chutes at the bottom). A grain auger may be powered by an electric motor; a tractor, through the power take-off; or sometimes an internal combustion engine mounted on the auger. The helical rotates inside a long metal tube, moving the grain upwards. On the lower end, a hopper receives grain from the truck or <b>grain</b> cart. A <b>chute</b> on the upper end guides the grain into the destination location.|$|R
50|$|The Reformation in Zürich {{was also}} a {{struggle}} of the opponents of the mendicant orders to win the favour {{of the citizens of}} Zürich. Zwingli forced disputations with combative sermons, the so-called pulpit-war; in spring of 1524 he banned the mendicant preaching, and on 3 December 1524 the repeal of the convents in Zürich was forced. The buildings of the Dominican convent were transferred to the then neighboring hospital that was the property of the city government, and the church was deconsecrated. A wall separates since 1541/42 the choir from the nave. In the Gothic choir, the probably then two upper wooden floors served as a grain warehouse, and on the ground floor, the hospital chapel was set up. The nave was used for five large wine presses. The choir was then divided by the catchment of five shelves so that worship for the residents of Niederdorf was held from 1544 until 1607. The upper floors of the choir were now used as the <b>grain</b> <b>chute.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{production of}} agricultural grains and other granular materials emphasises {{the need for}} bulk handling methods of transportation. The gravity flow of such materials through chutes is of basic relevance to this system of materials handling. An experimental study {{has been made of}} the flow of a granular material down an inclined chute. Three materials namely Hungarian Millet, Wheat and Polythene have been tested through large scale chutes of channel section. A differential equation is proposed which describes the flow, allowing for dynamic stresses due to intergranular motion. The main part of the study is directed towards a numerical solution of this equation. As a necessary preliminary, the several phenomena associated with the flow of a granular material through an orifice-chute system are investigated in order to qualify and define their influence The coefficient of friction of an agricultural grain varies with the number of repeated passes of the <b>grain</b> over the <b>chute</b> surface. A procedure is developed in order to minimise this variability. A granular material attains steady state flow, through an orifice-chute system, after a time period which depends on the flow rate and chute geometry. A study has been made of the transient flow phase, which exists during this time period, using a photographic technique. The two regimes of flow, nominated 'Fast' and 'Slow' by earlier researchers, are investigated in order to more clearly define the essential difference between these two modes of flow. For an orifice-chute system, with the orifice located in the base of the bin, the terms 'Fast&# 146; and 'Slow' relate to the mode of flow control through the system. The flow rate of the material through such an orifice-chute system is controlled by either the orifice or the chute. The major part of the experimental work investigates the distributions of pressure over the base and walls of a test chute and covers an analytical study of the steady state flow stream under uniform flow conditions. Using a pressure sensitive apparatus the lateral pressure at the wall and the normal pressure over the base are shown to increase rapidly near the right angled corner of the chute. A quantitative differential equation is derived for the uniform flow condition. The validity of this differential equation is tested for the non-uniform flow condition...|$|R
