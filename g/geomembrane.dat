25|$|Geosynthetic clay liners, or GCLs, are an {{interesting}} juxtaposition of polymeric materials and natural soils. They are rolls of factory fabricated thin layers of bentonite clay sandwiched between two geotextiles or bonded to a <b>geomembrane.</b> Structural integrity of the subsequent composite is obtained by needle-punching, stitching or adhesive bonding. GCLs are used as a composite component beneath a <b>geomembrane</b> or by themselves in geoenvironmental and containment applications {{as well as in}} transportation, geotechnical, hydraulic, and many private development applications.|$|E

25|$|The {{juxtaposition}} {{of the various}} types of geosynthetics just described with the primary function that the material is called upon to serve allows for the creation of an organizational matrix for geosynthetics; see table below. In essence, this matrix is the “scorecard” for understanding the entire geosynthetic field and its design related methodology. In the table the primary function that each geosynthetic can be called upon to serve is seen. Note that these are primary functions and in many cases (if not most) cases there are secondary functions, and perhaps tertiary ones as well. For example, a geotextile placed on soft soil will usually be designed {{on the basis of its}} reinforcement capability, but separation and filtration might certainly be secondary and tertiary considerations. As another example, a <b>geomembrane</b> is obviously used for its containment capability, but separation will always be a secondary function.|$|E

2500|$|Tensile {{strength}} {{represents the}} ability for a <b>geomembrane</b> to resist tensile stress. [...] Geomembranes are most commonly tested for tensile strength using one of three methods; the uniaxial tensile test described in ASTM D639-94, the wide-strip tensile test described in ASTM D4885-88, and the multiaxial tension test described in ASTM D5617-94. [...] The difference in these three methods lies in the boundaries imposed into the test specimens. [...] Uniaxial tests do not provide lateral restraint during testing and thus tests the sample under uniaxial stress conditions. [...] During the wide-strip test the sample is restrained laterally while the middle portion is unrestrained. [...] The multiaxial tensile test provides a plane stress boundary condition {{at the edges of}} the sample. [...] A typical range of tensile strengths in the machine direction are from 225 to 245lb/in for 60-mil HDPE to 280 to 325lb/in for 80-mil HDPE.|$|E

50|$|<b>Geomembranes</b> {{can serve}} {{numerous}} purposes in a cap design, including “provide a bioturbation barrier; stabilize the cap; reduce contaminant flux; prevent mixing of cap materials with underlying sediments; promote uniform consolidation, and; reduce erosion of capping materials”. <b>Geomembranes</b> {{have been used}} for stabilization in two projects along with granular media for the ISC constructed at Sheboygan River and in Eitrheim Bay, Norway. Although <b>geomembranes</b> seem to have great benefits, the problem of uplift and ballooning has arisen and not much research has gone into assessing what causes the lift of the <b>geomembranes</b> off of the surface.

40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} to determine thickness of smooth, nonreinforced <b>geomembranes</b> using three methods: mechanical (according to ASTM and European standards), ultrasonic, and magnetic methods. The mechanical method is the standard procedure used for determining thickness of <b>geomembranes.</b> The ultrasonic and magnetic methods are not commonly used for geomembranes; however, they are used for testing other materials such as metals. Tests {{were conducted}} on 15 <b>geomembranes</b> representing five types of polymers (HDPE, LLDPE, PVC, PP, and EPDM). The results of the testing program indicated {{that the level of}} pressures applied affected the thickness measurements in mechanical tests. While the low pressures were not sufficient to flatten particularly the rigid <b>geomembranes,</b> the high pressures tended to compress the <b>geomembranes</b> excessively. Both high and low pressures prevented obtaining representative measurements. The measurements obtained using the ASTM method were more reliable than the measurements obtained with the European method, although it is believed that the most reliable measurements can be obtained by the nondestructive methods (ultrasonic and magnetic). These techniques are sensitive only to the thickness of the materials due to the inherent properties of the test procedures, and they work equally well for rigid and flexible <b>geomembranes.</b> Of the two nondestructive methods, ultrasonic testing is better due to several advantages: it allows for testing from the top surface of geoembranes in the laboratory or in the field, and it can be used on coupons of <b>geomembranes</b> as well as on whole sheets without the need for removing test samples. Both nondestructive methods can be improved for application to <b>geomembranes...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The water puddle method (ASTM D7002), {{the water}} lance method (ASTM D7703) [...] {{and the newly}} {{introduced}} arc testing method (ASTM D7953) are used for bare geomembranes. For the water puddle and water lance methods, water is sprayed onto the <b>geomembrane,</b> creating an electrically conductive layer above the <b>geomembrane.</b> A low voltage DC power source {{is applied to the}} water above the <b>geomembrane</b> and grounded to the earth below the <b>geomembrane.</b> The leak detection equipment features an ammeter in series with the applied potential circuit. The ammeter registers an increase in current {{in the presence of a}} leak, resulting in an audible tone and visual increase in the current level. The expected minimum sensitivity of the water-based bare <b>geomembrane</b> liner integrity methods is a one millimeter diameter circular leak. For the arc testing method, water is not required. A low voltage is introduced above the <b>geomembrane</b> and grounded to the conductive layer below it. In the presence of a hole, an electrical arc is formed along with an audible alarm. Since the arc testing method is not dependent on water making good contact through the leak, it is more sensitive than the water-based methods. The minimum sensitivity of the arc testing bare <b>geomembrane</b> liner integrity method is a pinhole leak.|$|E

50|$|Ideally, seaming two <b>geomembrane</b> sheets {{should result}} in no net loss of tensile {{strength}} across the two sheets, and the joined sheets should perform as one single <b>geomembrane</b> sheet.
