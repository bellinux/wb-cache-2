The Independent on Sunday quoted Ramsay that the magazine [...] ".. always broke even, as <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> the price up if it started losing money.

It now houses the Bursar's Office after being completely gutted in 1988, but the quote from geologist Sir Archibald Geikie's 1905 published work remains {{on the front of}} the building: [...] "In the first place <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> accuracy." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2006, Ebert noted his own [...] "tendency {{to place}} what I now {{consider}} the year's best film in second place, perhaps because I {{was trying to}} make some kind of point with my top pick," [...] adding, [...] "In 1968, I should have ranked [...] above The Battle of Algiers. [...] In 1971, McCabe and Mrs. Miller was better than The Last Picture Show. [...] In 1974, Chinatown was probably better, in a different way, than Scenes from a Marriage. [...] In 1976, how could I rank Small Change above Taxi Driver? [...] In 1978, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> Days of Heaven above An Unmarried Woman. And in 1980, of course, Raging Bull was a better film than The Black Stallion... although I later chose Raging Bull as the best film of the entire decade of the 1980s, it was only the second-best film of 1980... am I the same person I was in 1968, 1971, or 1980? [...] I hope not." ...|$|E
500|$|Commented {{longtime}} former Atlanta Braves manager Bobby Cox on Bagwell – {{who opposed}} {{him from the}} dugout for the entirety of his career, including numerous times in the playoffs: [...] "Jeff Bagwell was [...] {{for so long and}} starred every year. [...] For me a guy that dominated like that for one team, even in the league stats through the years. [...] His are up there with anybody's. [...] <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> him in right away. [...] So he would get my vote on the first ballot." [...] Still, in spite of the speculation that Bagwell used performance-enhancing drugs, San Francisco Chronicle sportswriter Bruce Jenkins opined that Bagwell did not have the credentials to be in the Hall of Fame. [...] In July 2015, he acknowledged [...] "that many are suspicious of Bagwell—without proof, as you say. [...] I've always voted for the best players—Bonds, McGwire, Clemens, etc.—so that's not a factor for me. [...] I always found Bagwell just a bit short of Hall of Fame material." ...|$|E

[...] Carey included her duet with Busta Rhymes, [...] "I Know What You Want", which was released as a single from his album, It Ain't Safe No More (2002), and became Carey's highest charting song internationally since 2001, reaching top five peaks in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, Ireland, Italy, Switzerland, the US and the UK. In an interview with Carson Daly, Carey said, [...] "The Busta Rhymes duet...has become so successful and we always said <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> it on my album as well." [...] The re-release also included [...] "There Goes My Heart", [...] "Got a Thing 4 You" [...] featuring Da Brat and Elephant Man, and [...] "The One (So So Def Remix)" [...] featuring Bone Crusher.

500|$|... "Light Up" [...] {{features}} loud synth {{drums and}} plaintive piano strings. The Jay-Z-collaboration is a critique on the hip hop industry, its detrimental effects, and {{the trappings of}} being an artist: [...] "While all my closest friends out partyin'/ I'm just here makin' the music that they party to," [...] while Jay-Z gives advice: [...] "Drake, here's how they gonna come at you / with silly rap feuds, trying to distract you." [...] Jay-Z expands on the album's overarching theme of self-doubt: [...] "And since no good deed go unpunished / I'm not as cool with niggaz as I once was / I once was cool as the Fonz was / But these bright lights turned me to a monster." [...] "Miss Me" [...] has Lil Wayne rapping jokes, including a crude punch line about sucking [...] "the brown" [...] off his penis and subsequently groaning, [...] "Ewwww, that's nasty."

2500|$|According {{to several}} Independent employees, {{including}} Pipp and Black, Liebold manipulated Henry Ford and fomented his {{hatred of the}} Jews: Pipp stated that [...] "the door to Ford's mind was always open to anything Liebold wanted to shove in it, {{and during that time}} Mr. Ford developed a dislike for the Jews, a dislike which appeared to become stronger and more bitter as time went on... In one way and another, the feeling oozed into his system until it became a part of his living self." [...] Fred Black asserted: [...] "If I were to put the number one blame [...] on anyone, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> it on Liebold." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hal Wallis {{also saw}} the American Scott's test and {{recognized}} her potential. In a meeting, Wallis told Scott, [...] "If I could, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> you under contract.", {{but she did not}} believe him. She thought he was as powerful as Warner and was [...] "prevaricating". Unknown to Scott, years of infighting between Jack Warner and Wallis were about to climax. Under acrimonious circumstances, Wallis left Warner Bros. for Paramount Pictures. On the day that Scott was scheduled to leave for New York, she read about it in Variety, but she spent several months in New York before Feldman telegraphed her in August 1944—Wallis wanted to sign her to a contract.|$|E

2500|$|From 1983 onwards when on site, Saint Phalle {{lived in}} a small {{apartment}} built into The Empress, a house-sized sphinx-like sculpture in the garden. On the second level, her bedroom was inside one breast, and her kitchen was inside the other one. Each of these two rooms had a single recessed circular window, appearing as an inverted nipple when viewed from the outside. In 2000, she would recall: [...] "At last, my lifelong wish to live inside a sculpture was going to be granted: a space entirely made out of undulating curves ... I wanted to invent a new mother, a mother goddess, and be reborn within its form ... I would sleep in one breast. In the other <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> my kitchen".|$|E
2500|$|Carter {{has been}} criticised on several {{occasions}} by American officers for his conduct and command while in Afghanistan. He was described by Colonel Harry Tunnell, former Brigade Commander of 5/2 Stryker Brigade Combat Team, as displaying a [...] "gross lack of concern for subordinates" [...] throughout his command in Afghanistan in 2009 and 2010. Further criticism came from Lieutenant General Daniel P. Bolger, who claimed that [...] "young riflemen paid the price" [...] for Carter's [...] "risk-averse" [...] mentality and his unwillingness to allow his troops to defend themselves. Bolger also claimed that Carter refused to visit the front line and only visited safe positions by helicopter, while frequently refusing requests for aircraft and artillery support from troops under his command. Bolger further stated, [...] "He's {{not the type of}} general <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> in charge of anything." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{atmosphere}} at Edgbaston is {{reputed to be}} the most hostile in England for visiting teams.

It's like having another man in your side." [...] and the former England wicketkeeper Geraint Jones describes how [...] "The crowd here makes such a big noise when you are doing well ... it's a unique environment." [...] After winning the 2015 Ashes Test Match with Australia at Edgbaston, England captain Alastair Cook commented [...] "The Edgbaston crowd was up there with the loudest I can remember. With some of the chants, even guys who have played a fair bit of cricket were looking at each other and realising how special it was. Edgbaston has been a fantastic venue for us." ...|$|E

2500|$|Merrily We Roll Along (1981), {{with a book}} by George Furth, is one of Sondheim's more {{traditional}} scores; Frank Sinatra and Carly Simon have recorded songs from the musical. According to Sondheim's music director, Paul Gemignani, [...] "Part of Steve's ability is this extraordinary versatility." [...] Although Merrily closed after 16 performances, its score has been subsequently recorded. Martin Gottfried wrote, [...] "Sondheim had set out to write traditional songs... But [...] {{that there is nothing}} ordinary about the music." [...] Sondheim and Furth have revised the show since its original production, and Sondheim later said: [...] "Did I feel betrayed? I'm not sure <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> it like that. What did surprise me was the feeling around the Broadway community – if you can call it that, though I guess I will {{for lack of a better}} word – that they wanted Hal and me to fail." ...|$|E
2500|$|... he Elo {{equivalent}} of a given handicap degrades as you go down the scale. A knight seems to be worth around a thousand points when the [...] "weak" [...] player is around IM level, but it drops as you go down. For example, I'm about 2400 and I've played tons of knight odds games with students, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> the break-even point (for untimed but reasonably quick games) with me at around 1800, so maybe a 600 value at this level. An 1800 can probably give knight odds to a 1400, a 1400 to an 1100, an 1100 to a 900, etc. This is pretty obviously the way it must work, because the weaker the players are, the more likely the weaker one is to blunder a piece or more. When {{you get down to}} the level of the average 8 year old player, knight odds is just a slight edge, maybe 50 points or so.|$|E
2500|$|Due to her {{dissatisfaction with}} Kisss {{constrained}} timeframe of two months, Jepsen went into writing Emotion {{with the intent}} of crafting a project that was authentic and timeless. Whereas Kiss was developed in a acquiescent manner as Jepsen was simply grateful for the opportunity, Emotion was spurred by her desire to take more creative control. Jepsen commented that much of the album is about [...] "trying to get some power back" [...] after a recent break up and subsequent move to New York. She sought to channel a [...] "heart-on-your-sleeve sensibility" [...] reminiscent of the 1980s era after attending a Cyndi Lauper concert in Japan: [...] " [...] this is when pop was at its finest. [...] <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> out 'Girls Just Wanna Have Fun' today and I wouldn’t change a bloody thing." [...] These themes were further explored through [...] "old-school" [...] Prince and Madonna records on morning runs before Cinderella rehearsals. An epiphany came to Jepsen after finishing [...] "Emotion", the album's title track, where she realized that the 1980s pop sound combined with a more [...] "alternative" [...] production was what she had been seeking. This fashioned the album's direction entirely, which developed as the midway point between the [...] "pure" [...] pop she recorded in Los Angeles and the indie folk effort that was scrapped in New York. Jepsen has stated that the album is not strictly a period piece, but is [...] "tinted with shades of that era".|$|E
