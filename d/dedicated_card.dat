Most high end gaming pieces of hardware are dedicated graphics cards, and cost over $200, and can {{go as high as}} the price of a new computer, depending on the quality wanted. In the graphics cards department, using integrated chips is much cheaper than buying a <b>dedicated</b> <b>card,</b> however the performance conforms to the price.|$|E

30|$|A <b>dedicated</b> {{scanning}} <b>card</b> {{would avoid}} this trade-off, but increase hardware costs. Future mobile devices, such as smart phones and tablets, are presumably equipped with several flexible radios. With such devices, a <b>dedicated</b> scanning <b>card</b> {{would be a}} viable option. In Sect. 4, we will evaluate the trade-off between scanning frequency and AP detection speed {{as well as the}} benefit of a <b>dedicated</b> scanning <b>card.</b>|$|R

In our system, without a <b>dedicated</b> scanning <b>card,</b> we scan for a new AP every 2  s, while with a <b>dedicated</b> scanning <b>card,</b> we initiate a new scan every 500  ms. For all experiments, the hysteresis threshold was 0  dB.|$|R

Dedicated multiple-time tickets can be purchased for use on trips between Berguedà and Bages, Berguedà and Barcelona, and Ripollès and Barcelona.

50|$|The most {{important}} piece of graphics hardware is the graphics card, which is the piece of equipment that renders out all images and sends them to a display. There {{are two types of}} graphics cards: integrated and dedicated. An integrated graphics card, usually by Intel for use in their computers, is bound to the motherboard and shares RAM(Random Access Memory) with the CPU, reducing the total amount of RAM available. This is undesirable for running programs and applications that use a large amount of video memory. A dedicated graphics card has its own RAM and Processor for generating its images, and does not slow down the computer. Dedicated graphics cards also have higher performance than integrated graphics cards. It is possible to have both dedicated and integrated graphics, however once a dedicated graphics card is installed, the integrated card will no longer function until the <b>dedicated</b> <b>card</b> is removed.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{reports about}} the first Micromegas-based {{telescope}} built for applications in muon tomo-graphy. The telescope consists of four, 50 Â 50 cm 2 resistive multiplexed Micromegas with a 2 D layout and a self-triggering electronics based on the Dream chip. Thanks to the multiplexing, the four detectors were readout with a single Front-End Unit. The high voltages were provided by a <b>dedicated</b> <b>card</b> using low consumption CAEN miniaturized modules. A nano-PC (Hummingboard) ensured the HV control and monitoring coupled with a temperature feedback {{as well as the}} data acquisition and storage. The overall consumption of the instrument yielded 30 W only, i. e. the equivalent of a standard bulb. The telescope was operated outside during 3. 5 months to image the water tower of the CEA-Saclay research center, including a 1. 5 -month campaign with solar panels. The development of autonomous, low consumption muon telescopes with unprecedented accuracy opens new applications in imaging {{as well as in the}} field of muon metrology...|$|E
30|$|The {{total number}} of freeze events is lower if a <b>dedicated</b> {{scanning}} <b>card</b> is in operation, while the total length of freeze events is higher. With our optimized scanning procedure, the benefits {{in terms of the}} {{total number of}} freeze events are marginal and also the subjective quality differences experienced during the measurements were low. On the one hand, a <b>dedicated</b> scanning <b>card</b> might decrease the system complexity, as the question when to schedule a new scan is easier to be answered then. On the other hand, a <b>dedicated</b> scanning <b>card</b> increases hardware cost and energy consumption. Considering all those factors, a <b>dedicated</b> scanning <b>card</b> is only useful, if it allows being integrated into the system with low effort, for example, through software defined radios.|$|R

40|$|Cryptographic smartcards {{provide a}} standardized, {{interoperable}} way for multi-factor authentication. They {{bridge the gap}} between strong asymmetric authentication and short, user-friendly passwords (PINs) and protect long-term authentication secrets against malware and phishing attacks. However, to prevent malware from capturing entered PINs such cryptographic tokens must provide secure means for user input and output. This often makes their usage inconvenient, as dedicated input key pads and displays are expensive and do not integrate with mobile applications or public Internet terminals. The lack of user acceptance is perhaps best documented by the large variety of non-standard multi-factor authentication methods used in online banking. In this paper, we explore a novel compromise between tokens with <b>dedicated</b> <b>card</b> reader and USB or software-based solutions. We design and implement a cryptographic token using modern secure execution technology, resulting in a flexible, cost-efficient solution that is suitable for mobile use yet secure against common malware and phishing attacks. 15 page(s...|$|E
40|$|In {{this world}} of automation, there is a {{continuous}} need for the constant evolution and up gradation of the existing mechanisms. There is an urge for automation wherein people do less work and machines do more. This project aims at providing a user friendly and automated way of attendance entry and data management {{with the help of}} dedicated recorders placed at classrooms and labs. It also helps to avoid large registers, manual calculations, false entries etc. In places such as colleges, schools and large industries there is a continuous need for monitoring the presence of workforce – their in and out time etc. These details are marked in a register and the whole data is collected for each and every department and for every hour. Further there is a manual calculation that involves for salary calculation, number of days present or absent etc. The project proposes a system wherein any staff after entering into the classroom can record the attendance of the students in an electronic register. This register communicates with the PC placed at office rooms and the students’ details, time of attendance, staff details are all recorded in the PC. The PC does the rest of the job and no manual calculation or error occurs. It sends the students attendance report to their parents as SMS using GSM. The teachers can login to their respective id to check the student’s attendance status and save it. The project proposes a novel way of identification system that is tamper proof and is easily usable by everyone concerned. For that it uses NFC technology that is known for communication between multiple tags at a specific time. This particular feature of NFC makes identification and processing very easy as the signals are completely wireless and has a collision free algorithm to transmit and receive signals from multiple units. The staff can use a <b>dedicated</b> <b>card</b> for identifying themselves at the recorder. This prevents misuse by the students. Further the details of the staff are also recorded along with the attendance details. Further if any class is left without teacher for a particular period of time, it is also recorded and suitable authorities are alerted. Thus with the help of this the whole process of attendance management can be automated and it reduces lots of hardships and manual calculations. Further any detail regarding any person can be obtained within a few clicks at any time...|$|E
