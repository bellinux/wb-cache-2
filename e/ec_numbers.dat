5000|$|The {{database}} {{contains more}} than 40 data fields with enzyme-specific information on more than 7000 <b>EC</b> <b>numbers</b> that are classified according to the IUBMB.The different data fields cover information on the enzyme's nomenclature, reaction and specificity, enzyme structure, isolation and preparation, enzyme stability, kinetic parameters such as Km value and turnover number, occurrence and localization, mutants and engineered enzymes, application of enzymes and ligand-related data. Currently, BRENDA contains manually annotated data from over 140,000 different scientific articles. Each enzyme entry is clearly linked {{to at least one}} literature reference, to its source organism, and, where available, to the protein sequence of the enzyme. An important part of BRENDA represent the more than 110,000 enzyme ligands, which are available on their names, synonyms or via the chemical structure. The term [...] "ligand" [...] is used in this context to all low molecular weight compounds which interact with enzymes. These include not only metabolites of primary metabolism, co-substrates or cofactors but also enzyme inhibitors or metal ions. The origin of these molecules ranges from naturally occurring antibiotics to synthetic compounds that have been synthesized for the development of drugs or pesticides.Furthermore, cross-references to external information resources such as sequence and 3D-structure databases, as well as biomedical ontologies, are provided.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Despite {{the current}} {{availability}} of several {{hundreds of thousands}} of amino acid sequences, more than 36 % of the enzyme activities (<b>EC</b> <b>numbers)</b> defined by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (NC-IUBMB) are not associated with any amino acid sequence in major public databases. This wide gap separating knowledge of biochemical function and sequence information is found for nearly all classes of enzymes. Thus, there is an urgent need to explore these sequence-less <b>EC</b> <b>numbers,</b> in order to progressively close this gap. Description We designed ORENZA, a PostgreSQL database of ORphan ENZyme Activities, to collate information about the <b>EC</b> <b>numbers</b> defined by the NC-IUBMB with specific emphasis on orphan enzyme activities. Complete lists of all <b>EC</b> <b>numbers</b> and of orphan <b>EC</b> <b>numbers</b> are available and will be periodically updated. ORENZA allows one to browse the complete list of <b>EC</b> <b>numbers</b> or the subset associated with orphan enzymes or to query a specific EC number, an enzyme name or a species name for those interested in particular organisms. It is possible to search ORENZA for the different biochemical properties of the defined enzymes, the metabolic pathways in which they participate, the taxonomic data of the organisms whose genomes encode them, and many other features. The association of an enzyme activity with an amino acid sequence is clearly underlined, making it easy to identify at once the orphan enzyme activities. Interactive publishing of suggestions by the community would provide expert evidence for re-annotation of orphan <b>EC</b> <b>numbers</b> in public databases. Conclusion ORENZA is a Web resource designed to progressively bridge the unwanted gap between function (enzyme activities) and sequence (dataset present in public databases). ORENZA should increase interactions between communities of biochemists and of genomicists. This is expected {{to reduce the number of}} orphan enzyme activities by allocating gene sequences to the relevant enzymes. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Understanding of {{secondary}} metabolic pathway in plant {{is essential for}} finding druggable candidate enzymes. However, there are many enzymes whose functions are not yet discovered in organism-specific metabolic pathways. Towards identifying the functions of those enzymes, assignment of <b>EC</b> <b>numbers</b> to the enzymatic reactions they catalyze plays a key role, since <b>EC</b> <b>numbers</b> represent the categorization of enzymes on one hand, and the categorization of enzymatic reactions on the other hand. Results We propose reaction graph kernels for automatically assigning <b>EC</b> <b>numbers</b> to unknown enzymatic reactions in a metabolic network. Reaction graph kernels compute similarity between two chemical reactions considering the similarity of chemical compounds in reaction and their relationships. In computational experiments based on the KEGG/REACTION database, our method successfully predicted the first three digits of the EC number with 83 % accuracy. We also exhaustively predicted missing <b>EC</b> <b>numbers</b> in plant's secondary metabolism pathway. The prediction results of reaction graph kernels on 36 unknown enzymatic reactions are compared with an expert's knowledge. Using the same data for evaluation, we compared our method with E-zyme, and showed its ability to assign more number of accurate <b>EC</b> <b>numbers.</b> Conclusion Reaction graph kernels are a new metric for comparing enzymatic reactions. </p...|$|E
