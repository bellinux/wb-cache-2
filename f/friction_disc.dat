50|$|Braking {{is mainly}} done by {{electrodynamic}} brake enabling recuperation of the braking energy {{back to the}} electrical grid. If {{there is no need}} of it, the braking energy is being used primarily for feeding the vehicle's auxiliary equipment with the rest depleted in the brake resistors. The electrodynamic brake is able to automatically run even during grid's voltage failure. In case of failure, braking is automatically done by the system of <b>friction</b> <b>disc</b> brake, which will work until the vehicle comes to a complete halt. The <b>friction</b> <b>disc</b> brake is hydraulically controlled with an electric compression unit. Each bogies is also equipped with a pair of electromagnetic rail brakes with voltage of 24 V DC. The <b>friction</b> <b>disc</b> brake also ensures the parking brake function.|$|E
50|$|In the UK {{the most}} {{recently}} built Multiple Units {{such as the}} Bombardier Electrostar family still use <b>friction</b> (<b>disc)</b> brakes which are operated by electro-pneumatic valves for their primary braking system. Additionally Dynamic braking is blended with this to achieve a higher braking force and reduce brake pad wear.|$|E
50|$|An oil shear brake has {{a series}} of <b>friction</b> <b>discs</b> and steel plates similar to the {{clutches}} in an automobile automatic transmission. The shaft carrying the <b>friction</b> <b>discs</b> {{is attached to the}} load through a coupling. A piston pushes the stack of <b>friction</b> <b>discs</b> and steel plates together creating shear in the oil between the discs and plates applying a torque. Torque control can be pneumatic or hydraulic. Force lubrication maintains a film of oil between the surfaces to eliminate wear. Reaction is smooth to zero RPM without stick-slip. Loads up to hundreds of thermal horsepower can be absorbed through the required force lubrication and cooling unit. Most often, the brake is kinetically grounded through a torque arm anchored by a strain gauge which produces a current under load fed to the dynamometer control. Proportional or servo control valves are generally used to allow the dynamometer control to apply pressure to provide the program torque load with feedback from the strain gauge closing the loop. As torque requirements go up there are speed limitations.|$|R

First V-50 models had no external differences from the Š-62, but the internals were redesigned. It had a similar looking, but, better clutch. The only identical parts were plastic <b>friction</b> <b>discs.</b> Instead of 2 <b>friction</b> <b>discs,</b> the V-50 had 3 <b>friction</b> <b>discs,</b> and the gearbox in V-50 had ball bearings, instead of plain bearings. It had a new, and more modern electronic ignition, and the fuel tank was redesigned. The new V-50 engine was also used. Riga-22 was produced until 1989.1986 was a turn-around year for Riga. Deteriorating quality and engine problems made the need of a new model apparent. So in 1986 the new Riga Delta was introduced. The engine {{is in no way}} resembles its predecessor. The frame is completely changed. It has a new fuel tank, with only [...] "Delta" [...] written on it. Replaced the front and rear lamps and ignition. The Deltas were available in three colours pea-green, brick red and beige. Deltas also featured 3 gear gearbox.|$|R

5000|$|There are {{multiple}} designs of vehicle clutch, {{but most are}} based on one or more <b>friction</b> <b>discs</b> pressed tightly together or against a flywheel using springs. The friction material varies in composition depending on many considerations such as whether the clutch is [...] "dry" [...] or [...] "wet". <b>Friction</b> <b>discs</b> once contained asbestos, but this has been largely discontinued. Clutches found in heavy duty applications such as trucks and competition cars use ceramic plates that have a greatly increased friction coefficient. However, these have a [...] "grabby" [...] action generally considered unsuitable for passenger cars. The spring pressure is released when the clutch pedal is depressed thus either pushing or pulling the diaphragm of the pressure plate, depending on type. Raising the engine speed too high while engaging the clutch causes excessive clutch plate wear. Engaging the clutch abruptly when the engine is turning at high speed causes a harsh, jerky start. This kind of start is necessary and desirable in drag racing and other competitions, where speed {{is more important than}} comfort.|$|R

A clutch action was made by lifting the driven wheel off the drive disc. Moving the driven wheel past the centre gave a reverse gear. The smaller car with an engine rated for taxation at 5/6hp had tandem seating with the driver sitting behind the passenger. The larger model had a 7/9hp engine.|$|E
50|$|The A500, later renamed 40RH and 42RH (hydraulic {{controlled}} governor pressure) and 40RE, 42RE, 44RE (electronic controlled governor pressure, 1993-up), was an A904 derivative used in {{trucks and}} vans. Introduced in the 1989 model {{year on a}} limited basis, {{it was the first}} light-duty Chrysler four-speed automatic and was placed behind the 3.9 L and 5.2 L engines for light-duty purposes. Forward direct clutch drum (same as the A998) usually has a 4 <b>friction</b> <b>disc</b> pack - an A999 forward direct clutch drum with the 5 <b>friction</b> <b>disc</b> pack does interchange. Much like the later production A904 with a wide ratio gear a double wrap low-reverse band is used. An extension housing mounted (New Process built) overdrive unit was bolted {{to the rear of the}} case to provide a total of four forward speeds; the extension housing and its internals interchange with the 46-48RH/RE (A518/618) - when overhauling the overdrive unit transmission rebuilders usually would use replacement parts from the A518/618 overdrive section since the A500 internals are light duty e.g. number of friction discs and thick pressure plates. The overdrive housing (RWD/2WD) uses an output shaft yoke commonly shared with the A727 and its later derivatives except the A618/48RE. Electronic governor pressure was phased in during the middle of the 1993 model year where it was renamed as the A500SE - Jeep Grand Cherokees equipped with the 4.0L used the A500SE/42RE since the middle of the 1993 model year replacing the AW4.

40|$|Wet {{clutches}} {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} different machinery. Wet clutches and brakes are frequently used to distribute torque in vehicle drive-trains. The clutches can be located in e. g. automatic transmissions or limited slip differentials. Their frictional behavior is of great importance for the overall vehicle behavior and has to be thoroughly investigated when designing new wet clutch applications. Frictional behavior is normally investigated in test rigs where complete <b>friction</b> <b>discs</b> are tested under similar working conditions as for the clutches in the drive-train. However, it is today possible to simulate the clutch behavior and not limited ourselves to only use testings as a help {{in the design of the}} wet clutches. This is an advantage because it is possible to simulate behavior that is not possible to measure in test rigs. Another advantage is the faster and more cost efficient design process than when all tests are carried out in a laboratory. The torque transferred by the clutch during engagement can be roughly divided into full film torque and boundary lubrication torque. Full film torque originates from the part of the engagement where the <b>friction</b> <b>discs</b> are completely separated by a lubricant film and the friction surfaces are not in contact, whereas boundary lubrication torque occurs when the lubricant film is so thin that the surfaces of the <b>friction</b> <b>discs</b> are in direct contact. The distribution between these two types of torque is different for different types of wet clutches and engagements. When the clutch works in full film regime, it is possible to simulate the friction quite well, whereas the friction in the boundary regime is much more difficult to model and simulate, since it is very additive dependent. The most common use of wet clutches is in automatic transmissions for vehicles. Hence, most research in wet clutch testing and simulations are performed on wet clutches suitable for these applications. Here, the wet clutch is often used to brake a rotating shaft to standstill and the total engagement will have a duration of fractions of a second. During most of the engagement the clutch will be working in full film lubrication. In this investigation, the focus is on wet clutches working under limited slip conditions, i. e. the clutches will have a limited slip during a long duration without any lock-up. During this kind of engagement the clutch will work mainly in boundary lubrication and generate much heat. Such clutches can be found in, e. g. limited slip differentials. The optimum when designing a new wet clutch would be to simulate the clutch during the whole engagement without having to do any measurements in the laboratory. This, however, is not yet possible but an efficient way to design clutches can be obtained by combining fast friction measurements with efficient computer simulations. In this work, a simple friction measurement technique for wet clutches working in boundary lubrication is developed, based on pin on <b>disc</b> measurements. These <b>friction</b> measurements are combined with a temperature simulation of a wet clutch, where the lubricant cooling flow, dependent of the surface groove pattern, is simulated. This method makes it possible to allow a wet clutch working in boundary lubrication to be optimized for given working conditions regarding lubricant, friction material and surface groove pattern. The simulations are validated by measured data from a test rig in which whole <b>friction</b> <b>discs</b> are investigated with the same working conditions. Godkänd; 2006; 20061204 (parmar...|$|R

40|$|In {{industry}} {{today there}} are increasing demands not only on product performance, but also on environmental performance. In striving to develop high performance environmentally adapted products, optimization of product life is a central issue. The success of design optimization relies on {{an understanding of the}} degradation process and of the associated degradation mechanisms. A high level of costs is often associated with downtime of machinery caused by service and by replacement of machine components. Knowledge of ageing mechanisms facilitates evaluation of the remaining useful life, thus optimizing performance during the entire service life of components. In this study the ageing process of wet clutches has been investigated. Wet clutches are used in automatic transmissions and limited slip differentials in private vehicles and are designed to transfer torque. A wet clutch consists of a clutch pack submerged in lubricant. Separator and <b>friction</b> <b>discs</b> are alternately positioned in the clutch pack. The separator discs are connected to the input shaft and the <b>friction</b> <b>discs</b> are connected to the output shaft. When the clutch pack is pushed together friction is generated between the <b>friction</b> and separator <b>discs.</b> Torque transfer is thus created in the interface between contacting surfaces and torque transfer characteristics are determined by the interaction between lubricant and contacting surfaces. The investigations performed in this thesis have been designed to increase the understanding of wet clutch ageing and failure. Tests have been performed from full scale to model tests. Full scale testing describes the actual system which means that all significant degradation mechanisms are present. The disadvantage with full scale testing is {{that it is difficult to}} separate and isolate degradation mechanisms. In small scale model tests it is possible to isolate the degradation mechanisms and hence also what effects they have. Correlation of results from full scale to small scale can in turn increase the understanding of which degradation mechanisms are important for the system and how they influence the wet clutch system. The wet clutch lubricant and the contacting surfaces provide the friction characteristics of the clutch. Therefore, this work has focused on how lubricant degradation affects friction characteristics and hence wet clutch performance. Results in this study show that friction levels increase as lubricant degradation proceeds. In accelerated wet clutch test rig ageing, results in this study indicate that high temperatures in the interface between contacting surfaces greatly influence wet clutch degradation.

5000|$|The suicide clutch is {{sometimes}} incorrectly called a suicide shifter. The suicide clutch is a foot-operated clutch that {{is mounted on}} the left side of the motorcycle's forward foot controls. The suicide-clutch moniker has derived from difficulties in operating this form of clutch and shifter. On a motorcycle equipped with a conventional hand clutch and foot shifter, the rider places the left foot on the ground when stopped and holds the motorcycle in place with pressure on the rear brake pedal with the right foot, while engaging the clutch with the left hand. On a motorcycle equipped with a suicide clutch, the clutch is held in with the left foot, requiring the right foot to hold the bike in place, with the right hand applying pressure to the front brake. Early Harley Davidson foot clutches used an over-center spring to hold the clutch pedal in the disengaged position and used a <b>friction</b> <b>disc</b> to allow the rider to adjust the sensitivity of the return. Often riders removed the spring to keep the clutch pedal from returning to the disengaged position while riding. While this spring removal allowed for the clutch to stay engaged better, it also removed the safety feature of the clutch pedal holding itself in the disengaged position. With the pedal not returning to its natural disengaged position, the rider must either shift into neutral or hold the clutch pedal with the left foot when coming to a stop. Early Harley Davidson racers removed the clutch return spring to ensure the clutch stayed in the engaged position throughout the race. This practice soon caught on with other riders. The term [...] "suicide clutch" [...] was coined by those who could not operate the foot clutch proficiently enough to ride a tank shift (or hand shift) motorcycle in normal traffic.|$|E
