6000|$|... "Where can we be?" [...] Amuba asked. [...] "There is the sky overhead. We are {{twenty feet}} {{from the top of}} the wall, and where this <b>ledge</b> <b>ends,</b> just before it gets to the sides of this stone, it seems to go {{straight}} down." ...|$|R
60|$|Almost thoughtless of the consequences, I {{leaped from}} the <b>end</b> of the <b>ledge</b> upon which I stood, for the tiny shelf twenty feet below. At {{the same instant}} the dragon darted in toward the girl, but my sudden advent upon the scene must have startled him for he veered to one side, and then rose above us once more.|$|R
5000|$|The Mahaka Ponds (...) are two ponds close {{together}} at the southern <b>end</b> of Conrad <b>Ledge</b> in The Fortress, in the Cruzen Range of Victoria Land. The New Zealand Geographic Board revised its 2005 decision of Greenfield Ponds to Mahaka Ponds in 2006. Mahaka is a Māori word meaning twin, which is a descriptive name for the two ponds in close proximity.|$|R
5000|$|Williams Pond (...) is a pond 0.4 mi {{north of}} the east <b>end</b> of Hoffman <b>Ledge,</b> within the Labyrinth of Wright Valley, McMurdo Dry Valleys. The basin is named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) (2004) after M.W. (Max) Williams of Hamilton, New Zealand, a driller and {{supervisor}} with the New Zealand drilling team which was on site for the Murdo Dry Valleys Drilling Project from 1973 through 1976.|$|R
50|$|Low {{wished the}} front of his home to reflect his stature {{as one of the most}} {{influential}} and prosperous men of the community. To that <b>end,</b> a <b>ledge,</b> or sill course, sits approximately three feet up from the ground and encircles the house. This sill makes the house appear to be sitting on a pedestal. Low purchased large, rectangular blocks of high quality stone for the front facade (facing the river and the community of Raritan Landing), most likely quarried in the Newark area. Low was a frugal man and the only finely dressed stone is on the side of the house facing Raritan Landing. The other three sides were built of less expensive rubble stone, or irregular pieces that required minimal dressing.|$|R
60|$|Walking with a {{good deal}} of care, Stanley made his way along to a point where the ledge stopped, abruptly. Looking down, he saw the remains of a wall of solid masonry, and {{perceived}} that he had been correct in his surmise as to the purpose of the ledge. Then they turned, {{and went back to the}} other <b>end</b> of the <b>ledge.</b> A few feet before they reached this, Meinik--who was now leading the way--stopped.|$|R
50|$|Several {{patches of}} depths from 7.3 to 11 m (24 to 36 ft) lie on a 23 km (14 mi) long coral ledge located 3 km (2 mi) within the SE {{edge of the}} bank. A {{detached}} 11 m (36 ft) patch lies near the SW edge of the bank, 21.7 km (13 mi) WNW of the southern <b>end</b> of this <b>ledge.</b> A depth of 10.9 m (35 ft 10 in) lies close to {{the northern edge of}} the bank.|$|R
5|$|After {{passing the}} site of Ty Dwr the railway bends around 'Amen' corner and soon after the Village Incline is reached. From here the line runs into the gorge, high above the river on a narrow <b>ledge,</b> <b>ending</b> {{at the foot of}} the first incline leading to the Bryn Eglwys quarry. The {{original}} line fanned out into a set of three sidings, used to marshal trains of loaded slate wagons coming down from the quarry and empty wagons waiting to ascend. Nant Gwernol station, the eastern terminus of the line, was built on {{the site of}} the sidings.|$|R
50|$|The {{crust of}} {{limestone}} of Beauce <b>ends</b> with a <b>ledge</b> {{at the edge}} of the Bois de Verrières. It covers a thick impermeable layer about 50 m thick of sand mixed with marl from Fontainebleau which is itself resting on layers of green marl in which there are some areas of gypsum then finally blue marl forming the bottom of the Bièvre valley. These green and blue marls form a completely waterproof layer about 10 m thick. These set the date of these layers to the Tertiary period when the sea occupying the centre of the Paris Basin began to retreat.|$|R
5000|$|The Plattspitzen is a 2,680 metre high {{mountain}} in the Wetterstein Mountains {{on the border between}} Germany and Austria. It is a very striking mountain and the southern companion of Germany's highest peak, the Zugspitze, located at the opposite <b>end</b> of the <b>ledge</b> known as the Plattumrahmung. The mountain has three summits: the eastern summit, known as the Gatterlspitz (...) , the middle summit (Mittelgipfel, [...] ) and the western summit (Westgipfel, [...] ). It was first climbed in 1871 by Hermann von Barth, who conquered all three peaks alone departing from the Zugspitzplatt ledge. At that time the mountain was also known as the Wetterschrofen.|$|R
5000|$|Menster Ledge (...) is a {{relatively}} level benchlike feature which rises to 1800 m 6 nmi km southwest of Mount Olympus in Hughes Basin, Britannia Range, Antarctica. The feature is 2.5 nmi km wide and is smoothly ice covered in the central and northern portions; an abrupt ice and rock cliff forms the south <b>end</b> of the <b>ledge.</b> It was named after Chaplain William Menster (Commander, U.S. Navy) of the flagship [...] in Operation Highjump, 1946-47. The location of the ledge is in proximity to Byrd Glacier, Mount Olympus, and other features that memorialize leaders and ships of Operation Highjump.|$|R
60|$|As soon as Wychecombe {{had made}} all his preparations, {{he stood on}} the <b>end</b> of the <b>ledge,</b> {{tightened}} the line, looked carefully for a foothold {{on the other side of}} the chasm, and made his leap. As a matter of course, the body of the young man swung readily across the space, until the line became perpendicular, and then he found a surface so broken, as to render his ascent by no means difficult, aided as he was by the halyards. Scrambling upwards, he soon rejected the aid of the line, and sprang upon the head-land. At the same instant, Mildred fell senseless on the grass.|$|R
60|$|Festing {{followed}} him along the descending track, which presently <b>ended</b> at a <b>ledge</b> of rock sixty or seventy {{feet above the}} river. Wire ropes spanned {{the gap between the}} banks, and near the middle a rock islet broke the surface of the savage flood. Here men were pouring cement into holes among the foundations of an iron frame, while suspended trollies clanged across the wires. On the other bank was a small flat where shacks of log and bark stood among dripping tents. The roar of the river filled the gorge, but its deep note was broken by the rattle of hammers, clash of shovels, and clang of thrown-down rails.|$|R
60|$|The road led round {{under an}} {{overhanging}} cliff and was narrow, rocky, and slightly downhill. Bidding Madeline and Nels walk round this hazardous corner, Link drove the car. Madeline {{expected to hear}} it crash down into the canyon, but presently she saw Link waiting to take them aboard again. Then came steeper parts of the road, places that Link could run down if he had space below to control the car, {{and on the other}} hand places where the little inclines <b>ended</b> in abrupt <b>ledges</b> upon one side or a declivity upon the other. Here the cowboy, with ropes on the wheels and half-hitches upon the spurs of rock, let the car slide down.|$|R
60|$|But this cave {{served in}} reality as a blind. Climbing {{by one or}} two {{projecting}} points, the negro, closely followed by Nigel, reached a narrow ledge and walked along it a short distance. On coming to the <b>end</b> of the <b>ledge</b> he jumped down into a mass of undergrowth, where the track again became visible--winding among great masses of weatherworn lava. Here the ascent became very steep, and Moses put on what sporting men call a spurt, which took him far ahead of Nigel, despite {{the best efforts of}} the latter to keep up. Still our hero scorned to run or call out to his guide to wait, and thereby admit himself beaten. He pushed steadily on, and managed to keep the active Moses in view.|$|R

60|$|Once outside, {{with his}} breast {{pressed against the}} wall of rock, he passed along pretty quickly, {{considering}} that he could not see more than a few yards before him. But presently he came to the <b>end</b> of the <b>ledge,</b> and by no stretching out of foot or hand could he find another projection of any kind. He had now to face the great danger of sliding down to the lower ledge, and his heart beat audibly against his ribs as he gazed into the profound darkness below. Indecision was no part of Andrew Black's character. Breathing a silent prayer for help and deliverance, {{he sat down on the}} ledge with his feet overhanging the abyss. For one moment he reconsidered his position. Behind him were torture, starvation, prolonged misery, and almost certain death. Below was perhaps instantaneous death, or possible escape.|$|R
60|$|Oh! how bitterly {{he blamed}} himself for having {{neglected}} to acquire {{such a simple}} accomplishment. He might have learnt it when young, {{had he not been}} indifferent, or lazy about it. Often had he been advised to learn it by companions, but had treated the matter lightly and let the chance go by--and now, only fifty yards or so of deep water intervened between the <b>end</b> of the <b>ledges</b> of rock and the outside of the cavern, where he might perhaps find foothold enough to scramble along the base of the cliffs--but those fifty yards were equal to the Atlantic to him, he could not swim that distance to save his life. Once or twice, in a fit of desperation, he had almost plunged in to attempt it, and take his chance. Fortunately his courage failed. Had he taken the plunge his fate would no doubt have been sealed.|$|R

60|$|The {{light was}} still dim, {{the world now}} all in black and dark grey, and one sickly star still lingered overhead. The ledge they were on was a little grassy space, six feet wide, perhaps, and twenty feet long, sloping outwardly, and {{with a handful of}} St. John's wort growing near the edge. Below it the soft, white rock fell away in a steep slope of nearly fifty feet to the thick bush of hazel that fringed the river. Down the river this slope increased, until some way off a thin grass held its own right up to the crest of the cliff. Overhead, forty or fifty feet of rock bulged into the great masses {{characteristic}} of chalk, but at the <b>end</b> of the <b>ledge</b> a gully, a precipitous groove of discoloured rock, slashed the face of the cliff, and gave a footing to a scrubby growth, by which Eudena and Ugh-lomi went up and down.|$|R
60|$|Launching himself forward, he {{felt the}} flood lap his breast, but as his arms went in he struck {{something}} with his knee and found that he could stand on a submerged ledge. This carried him a yard or two, but the next moment he had stepped suddenly over the <b>end</b> of the <b>ledge</b> into deeper water. Floundering forward, he staggered up a strip of shelving shingle and lay there, breathless, waiting for Vane; then together they scrambled up the slope ahead. The work warmed them slightly, and they needed it; but as they strode on again, keeping {{to the foot of}} the hillside, where the timber was less dense, a cold rain drove into their faces. It grew steadily thicker; the straps began to gall their wet shoulders, and their saturated clothing clung heavily about their limbs. In spite of this, they struggled on until nightfall, when with difficulty they made a fire and, after a reduced supper, found a little humid warmth in their wet blankets.|$|R

60|$|I met {{his eyes}} {{squarely}} with mine and held them, which {{was perhaps the}} most sensible thing I could have done; though it was all unconscious on my part. In the brief moment that followed I did a lot of thinking. There was no escape, up or down; I must go on or turn back. If I jumped forward with a yell, as I had done before under different circumstances, would he not rush at me savagely, as all wild creatures do when cornered? No, the time for that had passed with the first instant of our meeting. The bluff would now be too apparent; it must be done without hesitation, or not at all. On the other hand, if I turned back he would follow me to the <b>end</b> of the <b>ledge,</b> growing bolder as he came on; and beyond that it was dangerous walking, where he had all the advantage and all the knowledge of his ground. Besides, it was late, and I wanted a salmon for my supper.|$|R

40|$|As {{stated in}} the thesis project, "The Ledge Site Community Planning Process was a unique {{opportunity}} {{for members of the}} Mission Hill neighborhood to develop a vision and plan for the Ledge Site. The Ledge Site, a 9. 38 acre parcel overlooking Brigham Circle, is the third largest underdeveloped parcel in the City of Boston. In most major urban settings, the typical approach to real estate development involves the developer (whether for profit or non-profit) who has an idea, owns property, hires an architect, presents a development scheme for permitting approval and holds the required community meeting. Designs {{may or may not be}} modified following public comment. Neighborhood residents are generally left out of the process and allowed to react at the very <b>end.</b> The <b>Ledge</b> Site Community Planning Process turned traditional development practices upside down. It started with soliciting the comments of residents on what they wanted to see built, who it should serve, and general concerns about changing the gateway to the community. Altogether, over four hundred participants were involved in creating a financially viable development plan that, when implemented, will create economic development and a new image for the neighborhood. The 25 million dollar development plan established will help to revitalize a depressed commercial district, create jobs and needed goods and services. It brought in technical consultants only when all interested community people had expressed their visions for the Ledge Site. The process demonstrated that individuals working together can have control of community development. It may very well be a model worthy of replication elsewhere.

6000|$|One {{of these}} {{ornamental}} ledges, stretching along the roof with many others, lost {{itself in the}} gloom {{and seemed to be}} a hopeful living-place--all the more hopeful that it was in the full blaze of light that gushed in through the front opening of the cave. This opening, it will be remembered, was {{on the face of the}} cliff and inaccessible. But Leather found that he could not reach the ledge. Hastening to the dark side of the cave, however, he saw that by means of some projections and crevices in the rocky wall he could reach the <b>end</b> of the <b>ledge.</b> Creeping along it he soon found himself close to the opening, surrounded by strong light, but effectually concealed from view by the ledge. It was as if he were on a natural rafter, peeping down on the floor below! As there was a multitude of such ledges around, which it would take several men many hours to examine, he began to breathe more freely, for, would the searchers not naturally think that a fugitive would fly to the darkest recesses of his place of refuge, rather than to the brightest and most accessible spot? ...|$|R
60|$|On gaining each {{successive}} ledge of the terraced hill-side, they walked along {{it in the}} hope of reaching better ground, or another snow-slope; but each <b>ledge</b> <b>ended</b> in a precipice, so that there was no resource left but to scramble down to the ledge below to find a similar disappointment. The slopes also increased, rather than decreased, in steepness, yet so gradually, that the mountaineers at last went dropping from point to point down the sheer cliffs without fully realising the danger of their position. At a certain point they came to the head of a slope so steep, that the snow had been unable to lie on it, and it was impossible to glissade on the pure ice. It was quite possible, however, to cut foot-holes down. Le Croix had with him a stout Manilla rope of about three hundred feet in length. With this tied round his waist, and Lewis, firmly planted, holding on to it, he commenced the staircase. Two blows sufficed for each step, yet two hours were consumed before the work was finished. Re-ascending, he tied the rope round Lewis, and thus enabled him to descend with a degree of confidence which he could not have felt if unattached. Le Croix himself descended without this moral support, but, being as sure-footed as a chamois, it mattered little.|$|R
40|$|The {{adsorption}} of bis- 3 -sodiumsulfopropyldisulfide (SPS) {{on metal}} electrodes in chloride-containing media has been intensively studied to unveil its accelerating effect on Cu electrodeposition. Molecular resolution {{scanning tunneling microscopy}} (STM) imaging technique {{was used in this}} study to explore the adsorption and decomposition of SPS molecules concurring with the electrodeposition of copper on an ordered Pt(111) electrode in 0. 1 M HClO 4 t 1 mM Cu(ClO 4) 2 t 1 mMKCl. Depending on the potential of Pt(111), SPS molecules could react, adsorb, and decompose at chloride-capped Cu films. A submonolayer of Cu adatoms classified as the underpotential deposition (UPD) layer at 0. 4 V (vs Ag/AgCl) was completely displaced by SPS molecules, possibly occurring via RSSR (SPS) t Cl_Cu_PtfRS__Ptt t RS_ (MPS) t Cu 2 t t Cl_, where MPS is 3 -mercaptopropanesulfonate. By contrast, at 0. 2 V, where a full monolayer of Cu was presumed to be deposited, SPS molecules were adsorbed in local (4 _ 4) structures at the lower <b>ends</b> of step <b>ledges.</b> Bulk Cu deposition driven by a small overpotential (η < 50 mV) proceeded slowly to yield an atomically smoothCu deposit at the very beginning (< 5 layers). On a bilayer Cu deposit, the chloride adlayer was still adsorbed to afford SPS admolecules arranged in a unique 1 D striped phase. SPS molecules could decompose into MPS upon further Cu deposition, as a (2 _ 2) -MPS structure was observed with prolonged in situ STM imaging. It was possible to visualize either SPS admolecules in the upper plane or chloride adlayer sitting underneath upon switching the imaging conditions. Overall, this study established a MPS molecular film adsorbed to the chloride adlayer sitting atop the Cu deposit...|$|R
5000|$|In 1898, a {{party of}} {{disappointed}} prospectors, returning from Kotzebue Sound, were shipwrecked a few {{miles east of the}} mouth of Lost River, and were obliged to camp at that point during the winter. A cabin built largely from wreckage of their schooner is known as the Kotzebue cabin. These prospectors probably first applied the name Lost River to this stream. In the succeeding summer a mining district was organized by survivors of this expedition, with headquarters located on King River, which enters Bering Sea between Lost River and Cape York. The Lost River region was included at that time in the King River recording district. No discoveries of gold were made, however, and the region was abandoned by prospectors. In the winter of 1902, prospectors again turned their attention to this region in the search for tin ore. Granite porphyry dikes, which occur in the limestones near the mouth of Lost River and also near King River, first attracted their attention, and many specimens of this were mistaken for [...] "tin crystals," [...] were sent to various assayers, from whom widely divergent reports were obtained. Early in the summer of 1903, Charles Randt, Leslie Crim, and Y. J. O'Brien discovered minerals in Tin Creek and made a thorough search for tin ore in that vicinity. They made a large collection of minerals, which was sent to Teller in July, 1903. Metallic tin was readily obtained from one small specimen by aid of a blowpipe, while the larger part of the collection was shown to contain minerals of no value. The collection was of sufficient interest to tempt an examination of the locality in detail where there was evidence of tin ore which had been seen in Teller to the granitic dike on Cassiterite Creek, and also to obtain specimens of stannite ore from Tin Creek. Since this examination the dike described has been called [...] "Cassiterite ledge" [...] in location notices, and it has been definitely traced through a group of four claims. A crosscut trench has been made near the Cassiterite Creek <b>end</b> of the <b>ledge,</b> which, it is reported, shows that the ledge has a width of 100 feet and that cassiterite is disseminated throughout the rock.|$|R
