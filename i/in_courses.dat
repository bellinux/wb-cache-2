5|$|Scientology is {{represented}} by {{a large number of}} independent associations or Vereine in Germany; their umbrella organisation is the Scientology Kirche Deutschland e.V. Germany's domestic intelligence service, the Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (BfV, or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution), estimates that there are 4,000 Scientologists in Germany, down from earlier estimates of 5,000 to 6,000. The Church of Scientology reported around 30,000 members from the mid-1990s onwards; this number remained stable for many years. However more recently Scientology has said it has only 12,000 members. Discrepancies in Scientology membership numbers arise because the Church of Scientology applies more inclusive criteria in establishing its figures, essentially including anyone who has purchased a book or participated <b>in</b> <b>courses,</b> regardless of their subsequent involvement. The number of contractually bound Scientology staff members working in German Scientology organizations is unlikely to exceed a few hundred.|$|E

5|$|Temple {{structures}} were built on foundations of stone slabs set into sand-filled trenches. Walls and other {{structures were}} built with large blocks of varying shapes. The blocks were laid <b>in</b> <b>courses,</b> usually without mortar. Each stone was dressed to fit with its neighbors, producing cuboid blocks whose uneven shapes interlocked. The interiors of walls were often built with less care, using rougher, poorer-quality stones. To build structures above ground level, the workers used construction ramps. When cutting chambers in living rock, workers excavated {{from the top}} down, carving a crawlspace near the ceiling and cutting down to the floor. Once the temple structure was complete, the rough faces of the stones were dressed to create a smooth surface. In decorating these surfaces, reliefs were carved into the stone or, if the stone was of too poor quality to carve, a layer of plaster that covered the stone surface. Reliefs were then decorated with gilding, inlay, or paint. The paints were usually mixtures of mineral pigments {{with some kind of}} adhesive, possibly natural gum.|$|E

40|$|Tropisetron is a 5 -HT 3 {{receptor}} antagonist which suppresses {{nausea and}} vomiting induced by cancer chemotherapeutic agents. In this study, tropisetron was evaluated on a compassionate-need basis in 545 cancer {{patients who had}} either proved refractory to antiemetic treatment during previous chemotherapy or who were {{at high risk of}} emesis as a result of current therapy. Tropisetron (5 mg or 10 mg) was administered as a 15 -minute infusion prior to chemotherapy, with the further possibility of an additional dose, either orally or parenterally, on one or more subsequent days. In some patients the drug was administered orally on the day before treatment. On Day 1 of Course 1, 64. 7 % of patients had a complete response to tropisetron, i. e. no nausea or vomiting, and 26. 9 % of patients had a partial response. More than 80 % of patients with a complete response <b>in</b> <b>Course</b> 1 had a complete response <b>in</b> <b>Course</b> 2 and of the partial responders <b>in</b> <b>Course</b> 1, 37 % achieved a complete response <b>in</b> <b>Course</b> 2.
