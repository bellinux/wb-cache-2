The <b>embryonic</b> <b>shield</b> has the same function as the dorsal lip of the blastopore and acts as the organizer. When transplanted, {{it is able to}} organize a secondary axis and removing it prevents the formation of dorsal structures. β-catenin also has a role similar to its role in amphibians. It accumulates in the nucleus only on the dorsal side; ventral β-catenin induces a secondary axis. It activates the expression of Squint (a Nodal related signaling protein aka ndr1) and Bozozok (a homeodomain transcription factor similar to Siamois) which act together to activate goosecoid in the <b>embryonic</b> <b>shield.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{appearance}} of the <b>embryonic</b> <b>shield,</b> a slight thickening {{at the leading edge}} of the blastoderm during the formation of the germ ring, is one of the first signs of dorsoventral polarity in the zebrafish embryo. It has been proposed that the shield plays a role in fish embryo patterning similar to that attributed to the amphibian dorsal lip. In a recent study, we fate mapped many of the cells in the region of the forming <b>embryonic</b> <b>shield,</b> and found that neural and mesodermal progenitors are intermingled (Shih, J. and Fraser, S. E. (1995) Development 121, 2755 – 2765), in contrast to the coherent region of mesodermal progenitors found at the amphibian dorsal lip. Here, we examine the fate and the inductive potential of the <b>embryonic</b> <b>shield</b> to determine if the intermingling reflects a different mode of embryonic patterning than that found in amphibians. Using the microsurgical techniques commonly used in amphibian and avian experimental embryology, we either grafted or deleted the region of the <b>embryonic</b> <b>shield.</b> Homotopic grafting experiments confirmed the fates of cells within the <b>embryonic</b> <b>shield</b> region, showing descendants in the hatching gland, head mesoderm, notochord, somitic mesoderm, endoderm and ventral aspect of the neuraxis. Heterotopic grafting experiments demonstrated that the <b>embryonic</b> <b>shield</b> can organize a second embryonic axis; however, contrary to our expectations based on amphibian research, the graft contributes extensively to the ectopic neuraxis. Microsurgical deletion of the <b>embryonic</b> <b>shield</b> region at the onset of germ ring formation has little effect on neural development: embryos with a well-formed and well-patterned neuraxis develop in the complete absence of notochord cells. While these results show that the <b>embryonic</b> <b>shield</b> is sufficient for ectopic axis formation, they also raise questions concerning the necessity of the shield region for neural induction and embryonic patterning after the formation of the germ ring...|$|E
40|$|The {{zebrafish}} {{has emerged}} as an important model system for the experimental analysis of vertebrate development because it is amenable to genetic analysis and because its optical clarity allows the movements and the differentiation of individual cells to be followed in vivo. In this paper, we have sought to characterize the spatial distribution of tissue progenitors within the outer cell layers of the <b>embryonic</b> <b>shield</b> region of the early gastrula. Single cells were labeled by iontophoretic injection of fluorescent dextrans. Subsequently, we documented their position {{with respect to the}} <b>embryonic</b> <b>shield</b> and their eventual fates. Our data show that progenitor cells of the neural, notochordal, somitic and endodermal lineages were all present within the <b>embryonic</b> <b>shield</b> region, and that these progenitors were arranged as intermingled populations. Moreover, close to the midline, there was evidence for significant biases in the distribution of neural and notochord progenitors between the layers, suggesting some degree of radial organization within the zebrafish <b>embryonic</b> <b>shield</b> region. The distributions of tissue progenitors in the zebrafish gastrula differ significantly from those in amphibians; this bears not only on interpretations of mutant phenotypes and in situ staining patterns, but also on our understanding of morphogenetic movements during gastrulation and of neural induction in the zebrafish...|$|E

The grafts differed strikingly in their capacity to develop into different segments of the gut. Endoderm underlying the neural plate developed into derivatives of the foregut, while endo-derm underlying the primitive streak developed mainly into derivatives of the mid- and hindgut.

40|$|AbstractIn {{zebrafish}} embryos, {{the nascent}} <b>embryonic</b> <b>shield</b> first {{appears as a}} thickening in the germ ring of the mid-epiboly blastoderm. This site defines the dorsal side of the developing embryo. In this paper, we report that the site of embryonic axis formation is marked earlier at the late-blastula stage {{by the appearance of}} a cluster of cells with unique endocytic activities. This cluster of cells is composed of enveloping layer epithelial cells and one to two layers of underlying deep cells. Unlike other marginal blastomeres, cells in this cluster do not participate in involution as the blastoderm undergoes epiboly. These noninvoluting endocytic marginal (NEM) cells can be selectively labeled by applying membrane impermeant fluorescent probes to pre-epiboly and mid-epiboly embryos. During <b>embryonic</b> <b>shield</b> formation, deep cells in the NEM cell cluster rearrange and are displaced forward to {{the leading edge of the}} blastoderm. As deep NEM cells move into this location, they become a group of cells known as “forerunner cells. ” Between 60 %- and 80 %-epiboly, the forerunner cells coalesce into a coherent cell cluster that forms a wedge-shaped cap at the leading edge of the blastoderm. During embryonic axis formation, deep cells migrate and converge toward the embryonic midline, which is defined by the center of the forerunner cell cluster. At approximately 90 % epiboly, the forerunner cell cluster becomes overlapped by the constricting germ ring. At tailbud stage, forerunner cells form the dorsal roof of Kupffer's vesicle, which is located ventral to the nascent chordoneural hinge. On the basis of previous grafting studies and known dorsal gene expression patterns, we discuss possible roles that the NEM/forerunner cell cluster may play in teleost axis formation...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of Spemann organizer {{is one of}} the most important steps in dorsoventral axis determination in vertebrate development. However, whether the organizer forms autonomously or is induced non-cell-autonomously is controversial.

The expression of dharma was first detected in several blastomeres at one side of the margin soon after the mid-blastula transition and continued in the dorsal side of the yolk syncytial layer (YSL) under the <b>embryonic</b> <b>shield,</b> the zebrafish organizer, until the onset of gastrulation. Furthermore, dharma expressed in the YSL induced the organizer in a non-cell-autonomous manner.

30|$|The {{expansion}} of blastoderm and slow peristaltic {{movement of the}} cellular perivitelline fluid were noticed. This is the commencement of epiboly - that is the very slowly morphogenetic peristaltic cellular movement. This movement involves more or less contraction and {{expansion of}} the blastoderm. The movement later increased gradually and consistently. At about 50 % epiboly (Figure  2 N), there was the definitive germ ring (Figure  2 O) evident around the blastoderm. The <b>embryonic</b> <b>shield</b> was discernible with thickness of the chorionic/perivitelline capsule (Figure  2 P). The characteristic cellular inward movement continued (Figure  2 Q) until the blastopore was closed marking the end of epiboly and/or gastrulation.

40|$|AbstractIn vertebrates, {{embryonic}} structures {{present at}} the dorsal midline, prechordal plate, notochord, hypochord and floor plate share a common embryonic origin. In zebrafish, they derive {{from a pool of}} progenitors located within the <b>embryonic</b> <b>shield</b> at the onset of gastrulation. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the common development of these structures remain unknown. Based on their spatial and temporal expression, transcription factors of the Forkhead box A (FoxA) family appeared to be good candidates to play such a role. In agreement with this hypothesis, we found that simultaneous knockdown of FoxA 2 and FoxA 3 abolish the formation of all axial derivatives, while overexpression of these transcription factors strongly enlarges dorsal mesodermal territories. We establish that, in FoxA 2 –FoxA 3 double morphants, precursors of axial tissues are correctly induced at early gastrula stage, but their dorsal midline identity is not maintained during development and we found that progenitors of these tissues are cell-autonomously re-specified to form muscle fibers as well as cells of the ventral neural tube. Our study provides the first example of a specific loss of all dorsal midline tissues and demonstrates that members of the FoxA family have redundant functions essential to maintain the axial identity of prechordal plate, notochord, floor plate and hypochord progenitors during gastrulation...|$|E

We described the early embryonic development of the loach, Misgurnus anguillicaudatus, based on morphological features and gene expression. Synchronous cleavage was repeated for 9 cycles about every 27 min at 20 ℃ after the first cleavage. After the 10 th synchronous cleavage, asynchronous cleavage was observed 5. 5 h post-fertilization (hpf), indicating the mid-blastula transition. The yolk syncytial layer (YSL) was formed at this time. Expressions of goosecoid and no tail were detected by whole-mount in situ hybridization from 6 hpf. This time corresponded to the late-blastula period. Thereafter, epiboly started and a blastoderm covered over the yolk cell at 8 hpf. At 10 hpf, the germ ring and the <b>embryonic</b> <b>shield</b> were formed, indicating the stage of early gastrula. Afterward, the epiboly advanced {{at the rate of}} 10 % of the yolk cell each hour. The blastoderm covered the yolk cell completely at 15 hpf.

40|$|AbstractIn zebrafish, as {{in other}} vertebrates, the {{secreted}} signalling molecule Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is expressed in organiser regions such as the embryonic midline and the zona limitans intrathalamica (zli). To investigate the regulatory mechanisms underlying the pattern of shh expression, we carried out a systematic analysis of the intronic regulatory sequences of zebrafish shh using stable transgenesis. Deletion analysis identified the modules responsible for expression in the <b>embryonic</b> <b>shield,</b> the hypothalamus and the zli and confirmed the activities of previously identified notochord and floor plate enhancers. We detected a strong synergism between regulatory regions. The degree of synergy varied over time in the hypothalamus suggesting different mechanisms for initiation and maintenance of expression. Our data show that the pattern of shh expression in the embryonic central nervous system involves an intricate crosstalk of at least 4 different regulatory regions. When compared to the enhancer activities of the mouse Shh gene, we observed a remarkable divergence of function of structurally conserved enhancer sequences. The activating region ar-C (61 % identical to SFPE 2 in mouse Shh), for example, mediates floor plate expression in the mouse embryo while it directs expression in the forebrain and the notochord and only weakly in the floor plate in the zebrafish embryo. This raises doubts on the predictive power of phylogenetic footprinting and indicates a stunning divergence of function of structurally conserved regulatory modules during vertebrate evolution...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFibroblast {{growth factors}} (Fgfs) play {{important}} roles in the pattern formation of early vertebrate embryos. We have identified a zebrafish ortholog of human FGF 17, named fgf 17 b. The first phase of fgf 17 b expression occurs in the blastodermal margin of late blastulae and in the <b>embryonic</b> <b>shield</b> of early gastrulae. The second phase starts after the onset of segmentation, mainly in the presomitic mesoderm and newly formed somites. Injection of fgf 17 b mRNA into one-cell embryos induces expression of the mesodermal marker no tail (ntl) and rescues ntl expression suppressed by overexpression of lefty 1 (lft 1). Overexpression of fgf 17 b dorsalizes zebrafish gastrulae by enhancing expression of chordin (chd), which is an antagonist of the ventralizing signals BMPs. In addition, overexpression of fgf 17 b posteriorizes the neuroectoderm. Simultaneous knockdown of fgf 17 b and fgf 8 with antisense morpholinos results in reduction of chd and ntl. Knockdown of fgf 17 b can alleviate inhibitory effect of ectopic expression of fgf 3 on otx 1. These data together suggest that Fgf 17 b {{plays a role in}} early embryonic patterning. We also demonstrate that fgf 17 b and fgf 8 have stronger mesoderm inducting activity than fgf 3, whereas fgf 17 b and fgf 3 have stronger activity in posteriorizing the neuroectoderm than fgf 8. Like fgf 8, activation of fgf 17 b expression depends on Nodal signaling...|$|E
40|$|Ichabod is a {{zebrafish}} (danio rerio) recessive {{maternal effect}} mutant, which exhibits severe anterior and dorsal deficits. Mutant embryos fail {{to form a}} morphologically normal <b>embryonic</b> <b>shield</b> or to develop head and notochord and exhibit an increase in ventrally derived structures such as ventral tail fin tissue and blood. The first molecular defect identified in ichabod mutants is the failure of β-catenin protein to enter the YSL nuclei on the dorsal side of the mid-blastula embryo. This observation is correlated {{with a lack of}} expression of bozozok and squint, early markers of the dorsal YSL. During gastrulation, embryos exhibit marked deficits in the expression of markers of organizer and axial mesoderm while showing expansion of markers of ventral fates, indicating a dramatic reassignment of dorsoventral identity. Complete rescue of the ichabod phenotype was achieved by injection of RNAs encoding β-catenin and presumptive downstream protein in the β-catenin pathway. However, no measurable amelioration of the ichabod defect was obtained with RNAs encoding upstream Wnt pathway components or by proteins that affect the activity of GSK- 3, suggesting that the ichabod mutation effects a step in dorsal determination independent of the regulation of β-catenin stability by GSK- 3. The genetic map position of the ichabod locus was determined using SSLP markers, allowing potential candidates to be evaluated. This work demonstrates that a maternally active gene, required for β-catenin nuclear localization, is necessary for signaling from the YSL resulting {{in the formation of the}} dorsal organizer in zebrafish. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{identified}} a zebrafish homologue of Dickkopf- 1 (Dkk 1), which was previously identified in Xenopus as a Wnt inhibitor with potent head-inducing activity. Zebrafish dkk 1 {{is expressed in}} the dorsal marginal blastoderm {{and also in the}} dorsal yolk syncytial layer after mid-blastula transition. At later blastula stages, the expression expands to the entire blastoderm margin. During gastrulation, dkk 1 -expressing cells are confined to the <b>embryonic</b> <b>shield</b> and later to the anterior axial mesendoderm, prospective prechordal plate. Embryos, in which dkk 1 was ectopically expressed, exhibited enlarged forebrain, eyes, and axial mesendoderm such as prechordal plate and notochord. dkk 1 expression in the dorso-anterior mesendoderm during gastrulation was prominently reduced in zebrafish mutants bozozok (boz), squint (sqt), and one-eyed pinhead (oep), which all display abnormalities in the formation and function of the Spemann organizer and axial mesendoderm. dkk 1 expression was normal in these embryos during the blastula period, indicating that zygotic functions of these genes are required for maintenance but not establishment of dkk 1 expression. Overexpression of dkk 1 suppressed defects in the development of forebrain, eyes, and notochord in boz mutants. Overexpression of dkk 1 promoted anterior neuroectoderm development in the embryos injected with antivin RNA, which lack most of the mesoderm and endoderm, suggesting that Dkk 1 can affect regionalization of neuroectoderm independently of dorso-anterior mesendoderm. These data indicate that Dkk 1, expressed in dorsal mesendoderm, functions in the formation of both the anterior nervous system and the axial mesendoderm in zebrafish...|$|E

Together with those in model vertebrates, the comparison suggested that a gnathostome ancestor would have utilized all of Otx 1, Otx 2 and Otx 5 paralogues in organizer and anterior mesendoderm for head development. In this animal, Otx 1 and Otx 2 would have also functioned in specification of the anterior neuroectoderm at presomite stage and subsequent development of forebrain/midbrain at somite stage, while Otx 5 expression would have already been specialized in epiphysis and eyes. Otx 1 and Otx 2 functions in anterior neuroectoderm and brain of the gnathostome ancestor would have been differentially maintained by Otx 1 in a basal actinopterygian and by Otx 2 in a basal sarcopterygian. Otx 5 expression in head organizer and anterior mesendoderm {{seems to have been}} lost in the teleost lineage after divergence of bichir, and also from the amniotes after divergence of amphibians as independent events. Otx 1 expression was lost from the organizer in the tetrapod lineage. In contrast, in a teleost ancestor prior to whole genome duplication, Otx 1 and Otx 2 would have both been expressed in the dorsal margin of blastoderm, <b>embryonic</b> <b>shield,</b> anterior mesendoderm, anterior neuroectoderm and forebrain/midbrain, at respective stages of head development. Subsequent whole genome duplication and the following genome changes would have caused different Otx paralogue usages in each teleost lineage.

Expression ofconnexin 43. 4 was induced in the early gastrula, coincident with the first definitive assignments of axial cell fate and the onset of the cell movements comprising convergence and extension in zebrafish. In situhybridization and immunohistochemistry revealed that during gastrulationconnexin 43. 4 mRNA and protein were progressively enriched in the germ ring and in the notochord primordia on the dorsal side of the embryo.

MATERIAL AND METHODS The pregnant animals (6 - 6 £ days ' post-coitum) were handled according to the methods previously described (Lutwak-Mann, 1954). In most cases the doe was anaesthetized by intravenous injection of nembutal, and the uterus removed and slit open. The blastocysts were picked out with a small stainless steel spoon and then quickly rinsed in physiological saline and fixed in absolute methanol for 1 hour or longer. The saline rinse is essential, since if it is omitted the acellu-lar outer membrane curls after the vesicle is torn and thus prevents mounting; apparently some substance that shrinks strongly on drying is rinsed off. Ethanol, Bouin's fluid, and Mayer's picro-nitric fixative with added osmic acid, which Hartmann (1916) used for opossum blastocysts, all caused crumpling of the trophoblast.

40|$|Abstract Background Primordial {{germ cells}} (PGCs) {{give rise to}} gametes that are {{responsible}} {{for the development of a}} new organism in the next generation. Two modes of germ line specification have been described: the inheritance of asymmetrically-localized maternally provided cytoplasmic determinants and the induction of the PGC fate by other cell types. PGCs specification in zebrafish appears to depend on inheritance of germ plasm in which several RNA molecules such as vasa and nanos reside. Whether the specification mode of PGCs found in zebrafish is general for other fish species was brought into question upon analysis of olvas expression – the vasa homologue in another teleost, medaka (Oryzias latipes). Here, in contrast to the findings in zebrafish, the PGCs are found in a predictable position relative to a somatic structure, the <b>embryonic</b> <b>shield.</b> This finding, coupled with the fact that vasa mRNA, which is localized to the germ plasm of zebrafish but does not label a similar structure in medaka opened the possibility of fundamentally different mechanisms governing PGC specification in these two fish species. Results In this study we addressed the question concerning the mode of PGC specification in medaka using embryological experiments, analysis of RNA stability in the PGCs and electron microscopy observations. Dramatic alterations in the somatic environment, i. e. induction of a secondary axis or mesoderm formation alteration, did not affect the PGC number. Furthermore, the PGCs of medaka are capable of protecting specific RNA molecules from degradation and could therefore exhibit a specific mRNA expression pattern controlled by posttrancriptional mechanisms. Subsequent analysis of 4 -cell stage medaka embryos using electron microscopy revealed germ plasm-like structures located at a region corresponding to that of zebrafish germ plasm. Conclusion Taken together, these results are consistent with the idea that in medaka the inheritance of maternally provided asymmetrically-localized cytoplasmic determinants directs cells to assume the germ line fate similar to zebrafish PGCs. </p...|$|E

The fish had been collected only from Misaki, Kanagawa Pref. and Onahama, Fukushima Pref. in Japan. The authors examined over one hundred specimens newly collected from Hayama in Kanagawa Pref., Tsuyazaki in Fukuoka Pref., Meshima Island and Nomozaki both in Nagasaki Pref. At the rocky shore of Akase, a small reef situated in the coast near the Fisheries Experimental Station of Nagasaki University in Nomozaki (Lat. 32 ° 35. 3 'N, Long. 129 ° 45. 5 'E), the fish was found concealing itself in sand and gravel sedimented under stones or pebbles laying the intertidal zone, and feeding on gammarus, copepods and larvae of shells. In May and August, 1971 three egg masses of this fish attaching to the under sides of stones {{and a piece of}} a roof tile laying in the habitat were collected. In two cases of the spawnings each egg mass was guared by a male parent staying under the stone or roof tile. The egg mass rather dense in one layer, and the eggs numbered 79 and 102 in the two cases. The eggs are club-shaped being 1. 90 to 2. 10 mm in long axis and 0. 62 to 0. 68 mm in short axis, and each provided with a shallow depression encircling at the distal end and a bundle of adhesive filaments at the basal end.

The newly hatched larva is 3. 43 mm in total length and it is provided with the large eyes, a remnant of yolk, 44 (23 + 21) myomeres, and the anus opening in the posterior part of the body. The melanophores and xanthophores in the dorsal mid line are characteristic in disposition. Fifty individuals of the newly hatched planktonic larvae were reared in a 30 liter plastic aquarium, and six of them grew up to the juveniles over 15 mm in total length entered into the bottom life in 32 days. They were fed with trocophore larvae of the oyster, Crassostrea gigas in the first feeding stage and with the rotifer, Brachionus plicatilis, nauplii of brine shrimp, Artemia salina and planktonic copepods from sea in the next stage. Along with the larval development, the larva became more slender and cylindrical in body form, and the eyes and pectoral fins relatively reduced in size. The rudiment of the air bladder moved from the anterior part to the posterior part of the peritoneal cavity. But the rudiment of the ventral fin did not appear throughout the larval development.
