500|$|On 16 December, {{the first}} request was sent from South Africa for {{auxiliary}} troops, {{and a commitment}} was made to send a [...] "considerable force of militia and picked yeomanry and volunteers". In early January, the reinforcements to be sent out included one service company of volunteers for each regular battalion, one complete volunteer battalion, and seven militia battalions. A large number of battalions of the Militia, which had volunteered for overseas service, were eventually sent {{out of the country}} during the war; sixty, with around 46,000 men, went to South Africa, whilst eight more served in colonial garrisons. They were employed mainly on lines of communication, and regarded as second-line troops of low quality; this was unsurprising, as they were strongly deficient in officers and heavily composed of men of 18 and 19, who would have been regarded as too young by the regular Army. The deficiencies of the militia were increased by {{the fact that many of}} its best and most experienced men had volunteered for the Militia Reserve: Of the 30,000-strong militia reserve, 13,000 were stripped from their battalions and sent overseas as drafts for regular units, while some of the 10,000 who had already travelled to South Africa with the militia were subsequently transferred to regular units while overseas. Sir Ian Hamilton commented that [...] "the men from the Militia Reserve who were in regular battalions were quite excellent... Every commanding officer <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> them said they were first class men. The Militia battalions that had come out, had lost many of their officers, who had gone to regular battalions to replace losses in the earlier part of the war. They had also been somewhat short of officers to start with... that [...] was what they were best suited for under the circumstances." ...|$|E
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> {{his home}} in Maryland; of his journey to the Ohio River, and, finally, how he felt while bound to the stake.|$|E
60|$|At {{the far end}} of {{the house}} Dick {{conducted}} me to a little room, very satisfactory indeed to me. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> bunk-houses for the cowboys, and he said they were full to overflowing.|$|E
60|$|A waiter whom I knew came up {{to greet}} us. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him <b>about</b> Louis. He held out his hands.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> her <b>about</b> it {{yesterday}} {{she said she}} was not quite sure, it would be better not to speak till she knew." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> will <b>ask</b> <b>about</b> his collegian extraction. Such a {{question}} {{never occurred to}} me. Apollo taught him under the laurels, while all the Muses looked through the boughs.|$|R
6000|$|First, Howells and I had a chat together. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> Mrs. H. He {{said she}} was fine, still {{steadily}} improving, and nearly back to her old best health. I asked (as if I didn't know): ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh dear, no, sir. I {{felt a bit}} anxious, Benson is so forgetful, and it was me {{who sent}} him after you, for I {{happened}} to see you go out, so I felt responsible. Being marked that way, I {{thought it might be}} important so <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E
60|$|Altogether <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> fifty {{people that}} day about gas, {{and they all}} {{said that it was}} {{absolutely}} nothing. When I said that I was to take it to-morrow, they showed no concern whatever. I looked in their faces for traces of anxiety. There weren't any. They all said that it wouldn't hurt me, that it was nothing.|$|E
2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{my father}} <b>about</b> Ali and Muawiyah. He (Ahmad Ibn Hanbal) ...|$|R
60|$|When Sullivan {{appeared}} in the morning, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him <b>about</b> my mare, which he informed me was doing well. I then bade him bring me hot shaving-water, in a loud dignified tone.|$|R
6000|$|... “I don’t {{think he}} knows her. She knows him—which is very different. When <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> him <b>about</b> her he merely tells me she’s fascinating. She is fascinating,” said her ladyship with inimitable dryness.|$|R
6000|$|I said to {{the more}} {{powerful}} of the two sorcerers--"What would happen if one of your spirits had overpowered me?" [...] "You would go out of this room," [...] he answered, [...] "with his character added to your own." [...] <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> the origin of his sorcery, but got little of importance, except that he had learned it from his father. He would not tell me more, for he had, it appeared, taken a vow of secrecy.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I saw the {{envelope}} was to Mr. Danvers, sir, {{and you had}} told me about him. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> the post, {{and they said that}} it was going out that day, and as you had written before you went out I was sure that you wanted the letter to go by it, so I made a shift to write a line at the bottom to say that you could not finish it because you had got hurt, and then fastened it up and posted it. I hope that was right, sir.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's right," [...] said Steve. [...] "That's it in a nutshell. Say, it {{was this}} way. It seemed to me that, having no kid of his own age to play around with, his nibs was apt to get lonesome, so <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> and {{found that there was}} a guy of the name of Whiting living near here who had a kid of the same age or thereabouts. Maybe you {{remember}} him? He used to fight at the feather-weight limit some time back. Called himself Young O'Brien. He was a pretty good scrapper in his time, and now he's up here looking after some gent's prize dogs.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That one can't go {{on without}} it. Miss Charlecote said {{she thought it was}} all {{constitution}} whether one is stout or not, and that nothing made much difference, when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> her <b>about</b> German wines.' ...|$|R
60|$|It touches me to {{read what}} you write of your poor mother. But, of course, at her age, each winter counts heavily. Do give her my love, and tell her that <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> you <b>about</b> her.|$|R
60|$|Here <b>I</b> {{would have}} <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> this {{grandson}} and the tomb, but having no time, held my peace.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ned writes good, gossipy letters I {{taught him}} how and he tells me all that 's going on. When he 'd spoken of this girl several times (they board with her mother, you know), <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> her, quite carelessly, {{and he told me}} she was pretty, good, and well educated, and he thought Tom was rather smitten. That was a blow, for you see, Fan, since Trix broke the engagement, and it was n't wrong to think of Tom, I let myself hope, just a little, and was so happy! Now I must give it up, and now I see how much I hoped, and what a dreadful loss it 's going to be." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> buses. Then the responsible-looking, tired-eyed youth {{told me he}} was the bus-driver. He {{had come}} from Oristano, on the main line, that day. It is a {{distance}} of some forty miles. Next morning he was going on over the mountains to Nuoro--about the same distance again. The youth with the little black moustache and the Greek, large eyes, was his mate, the conductor. This was their run, from Oristano to Nuoro--a course of ninety miles or more. And every day on, on, on. No wonder he looked nerve-tired. Yet he had that kind of dignity, the wistful seriousness and pride of a man in machine control: the only god-like ones today, those who pull the iron levers and are the gods in the machine.|$|E
6000|$|Foreigner of a {{different}} cast,--Count Olonym (Olonyne--that's it), son of the President of the Royal Society and a captain in the Imperial Guards. He is mean-looking and sickly, but has much sense, candour, and general information. There was at Abbotsford, and is here, for education just now, a young Count Davidoff, with a tutor Mr. Collyer. He is a nephew of the famous Orloffs. It is quite surprising how much sense and sound thinking this youth has at the early age of sixteen, without the least self-conceit or forwardness. On the contrary, he seems kind, modest, and ingenuous.[30] To questions which <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> the state of Russia he answered with the precision and accuracy of twice his years. I should be sorry the saying were verified in him-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't. You mustn't think I {{object to}} people when <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>about</b> them. All that I wished {{was that you}} should think {{yourself}} what sort of influence he was. I think he's a very good influence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{century before}} the last? Thank you!" [...] Strether laughed. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>about</b> {{some of the}} ladies it can't be then that I may hope, as such a {{specimen}} of the rococo, to please them." ...|$|R
40|$|Early years {{education}} {{is now a}} global activity, as school systems expand and diverse programmes become established in countries throughout the world. We inherit a rich legacy of theories, methodologies and evidence, from the vision of early childhood pioneers to the latest empirical research. I want to step back from particular initiatives and research evaluations to consider the underlying images of the child that inform early childhood research and practice. What would be an appropriate child development paradigm for promoting quality early years education in a global context? I question the adequacy of much theory and research to encompass global childhoods, especially the dangers inherent in current knowledge-imbalances. <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>about</b> the way child development is conceptualised within early childhood work, and the potential of a sociocultural perspective. Finally, <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>about</b> the status of young children themselves within early education research and practice; whether they are viewed as subjects in a child development project, as participants in a process or as consumers of a service. For each theme, I will argue that we are witnessing a paradigm shift which takes us beyond idealisations about normal development, children's nature and their needs. An alternative paradigm emphasises the plurality of pathways through childhood, the respects in which early development and {{education is}} a sociocultural process, {{and the status of}} children as active participants, with their own perspective on issues in their lives...|$|R
6000|$|The cabin-boy Ransome (from whom I {{had first}} heard of these atrocities) {{came in at}} times from the round-house, where he berthed and served, now nursing a bruised limb in silent agony, now raving against the cruelty of Mr. Shuan. It made my heart bleed; but the men had a great respect for the chief mate, who was, as they said, [...] "the only seaman of the whole jing-bang, and none such a bad man when he was sober." [...] Indeed, I found there was a strange {{peculiarity}} about our two mates: that Mr. Riach was sullen, unkind, and harsh when he was sober, and Mr. Shuan would not hurt a fly except when he was drinking. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> the captain; but I was told drink made no difference upon that man of iron.|$|E
6000|$|... "The engine {{bell was}} ringing, {{and the train}} {{starting}} off slow. I goes up to the kid and places him under arrest, and takes away his gun. But the first thing I knew that caballard of capitalists makes a break for the train. One of 'em hesitates {{in front of me}} for a second, and kind of smiles and shoves his hand up against my chin, and I sort of laid down on the platform and took a nap. I never was afraid of guns; but I don't want any person except a barber to take liberties like that with my face again. When I woke up, the whole outfit--train, boy, and all--was gone. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> Pedro, and they told me the doctor said he would recover provided his wounds didn't turn out to be fatal.|$|E
6000|$|... "That isn't {{so easy to}} say. As to {{his natural}} history, {{he lives with his}} mother in a tumbledown, {{unpainted}} wooden house in the deepest fastness of Willoughby Pastures. Lucy and I used to drive by it and wonder what kind of people inhabited that solitude. There were milk- cans scattered round the door-yard, and the Monday we were there a poverty-stricken wash flapped across it. The thought of the place preyed upon me till one day <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> it at the post-office, and the postmistress told me that the boy was quite a literary character, and read everything he could lay his hands on, and 'sat up nights' writing poetry. It seemed to me a very clear case of genius, and the postmistress's facts rankled in my mind till I couldn't stand it any longer. Then I went to see him. I suppose Lucy has told you the rest?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] {{said his}} sister, [...] "I {{strongly}} suspect something {{wrong about the}} boys. Fergus was very odd and silent last night when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him <b>about</b> Jem Horner's picnic, and he said something about that Harewood cousin being an unmitigated brute." ...|$|R
2500|$|It’s been a {{long time}} since that when I step out with someone <b>I</b> could <b>ask</b> <b>about</b> this kind of things, whether is or not the subject, I ask: Do you read La Razón? Have you noticed some {{articles}} signed by Rafael Barrett? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's what <b>I</b> might <b>ask</b> <b>about</b> you," [...] {{she said}} pertly, {{but with a}} slight touch of scorn; [...] "but I guess I {{know as well as}} I do about the others. I came here to see my father," [...] she added defiantly.|$|R
6000|$|I had to {{come away}} without that {{personal}} acquaintance with the great Manchester ship-canal which I almost equally desired. Coming or going, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> it, and was told, looking for it from the car window, there, there it was! but beyond a glimpse of something very long and very straight marking the landscape with lines no more convincing than those which science was once decided, and then undecided, to call canals on the planet Mars, I had no sight of it. I do not say this was not my fault; and I will not pretend that the canal, like the mills of Manchester, was not running. I dare say I {{was not in the}} right hands, but this was not for want of trying to get into them. In the local delusion that it was then summer, those whose kindness might have befriended the ignorance of the stranger were [...] "away on their holidays": that was exactly the phrase.|$|E
6000|$|May 16.--Breakfasted with Mr. Reynolds; a {{miscellaneous}} party. Wordsworth, right welcome unto me was there. I {{had also}} a sight of Godwin the philosopher, grown old and thin--of Douglas Kinnaird, whom <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> Byron's statue, {{which is going}} forward--of Luttrell, and others whom I knew not. I stayed an instant at Pickering's, a young publisher's, and bought some dramatic reprints. I love them very much, but I would [not] advise a young man to undertake them. They are of course dear, and as they have not the dignity of scarcity, the bibliomaniacs pass them by {{as if they were}} plated candlesticks. They may hold as good a light for all that as if they were real silver, and therefore I buy them when I can light on them. But here I am spending money when I have more need to make it. On Monday, the 26th, it shall be Northward ho! ...|$|E
6000|$|On {{our way to}} {{the upper}} regions I asked if there had been any {{visitors}} on the previous day. There had been only two visitors, friends of the lodgers--and Mrs. Crosscapel herself had let them both out. My next inquiry related to the lodgers themselves. On the ground floor there was Miss Mybus. On the first floor (occupying both rooms) Mr. Barfield, an old bachelor, employed in a merchant's office. On the second floor, in the front room, Mr. John Zebedee, the murdered man, and his wife. In the back room, Mr. Deluc; described as a cigar agent, and supposed to be a Creole gentleman from Martinique. In the front garret, Mr. and Mrs. Crosscapel. In the back garret, the cook and the housemaid. These were the inhabitants, regularly accounted for. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> the servants. [...] "Both excellent characters," [...] says the landlady, [...] "or they would not be in my service." ...|$|E
60|$|Oh, Dick, I'm {{so full of}} my own troubles, <b>I</b> {{forgot to}} <b>ask</b> <b>about</b> yours. I'm so {{sorry to hear that}} you're ill.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{calculated}} it--allowing {{the necessary}} margin--and I am {{sure of what}} I say. And I have done something else; <b>I</b> have <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> the Marriage License. I can easily find lodgings in the neighbourhood. We might be married at Harrow in a fortnight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'That's {{the kind}} of a canter,' says I. 'Shake the New York dust off your hoofs and be a real {{agreeable}} kind of a centaur. You broke the ice, you know, and we're getting better acquainted every minute. Seems to me <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> you <b>about</b> your family?' ...|$|R
