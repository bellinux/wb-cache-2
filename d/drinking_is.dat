5|$|A complex {{mixture of}} genetic and {{environmental}} factors influences {{the risk of the}} development of alcoholism. Genes that influence the metabolism of alcohol also influence the risk of alcoholism, and may be indicated by a family history of alcoholism. One paper has found that alcohol use at an early age may influence the expression of genes which increase the risk of alcohol dependence. Individuals who have a genetic disposition to alcoholism {{are also more likely to}} begin drinking at an earlier age than average. Also, a younger age of onset of <b>drinking</b> <b>is</b> associated with an increased risk of the development of alcoholism, and about 40 percent of alcoholics will drink excessively by their late adolescence. It is not entirely clear whether this association is causal, and some researchers have been known to disagree with this view.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the factors related to problem drinking in male workers according to occupational classes. Data were derived from the 2012 Korean National Survey on male workers. A total of 391 office workers, 707 manufacturing workers, and 309 service workers participated in this study. Data were analyzed using Rao-Scott Χ 2 -test, simple and multiple logistic regressions. Problem <b>drinking</b> <b>was</b> defined as ≥ 8 points in the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. The problem <b>drinking</b> rates <b>were</b> 45. 1 % in office workers, 39. 1 % in manufacturing, and 42. 3 % in service. In office workers, the factor related to problem <b>drinking</b> <b>was</b> only smoking. In manufacturing workers, the factors related to problem <b>drinking</b> <b>were</b> spouse, smoking and prevalence of Diabetes. In service workers, the factors related to problem <b>drinking</b> <b>were</b> age and smoking. Therefore, different intervention should be developed for each occupational class in order to manage the problem drinking in male workers...|$|R

25|$|Binge <b>drinking</b> <b>is</b> {{associated}} with a profound social harm, economic costs as well as increased disease burden. Binge <b>drinking</b> <b>is</b> more common in males, during adolescence and young adulthood. Heavy regular binge <b>drinking</b> <b>is</b> {{associated with}} adverse effects on neurologic, cardiac, gastrointestinal, hematologic, immune, musculoskeletal organ systems as well as increasing the risk of alcohol induced psychiatric disorders. A US-based {{review of the literature}} found that up to one-third of adolescents binge-drink, with six percent reaching the threshold of having an alcohol-related substance use disorder. Approximately one in 25 women binge-drinks during pregnancy, which can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Binge drinking during adolescence is associated with traffic accidents and other types of accidents, violent behavior as well as suicide. The more often a child or adolescent binge drinks and the younger they are the more likely that they will develop an alcohol use disorder including alcoholism. A large number of adolescents who binge-drink also consume other psychotropic substances.|$|E

40|$|In three experiments, interim water <b>drinking</b> <b>was</b> {{examined}} in rats {{exposed to a}} multiple schedule whose two components were extinction and a variable-time 30 -s schedule of food delivery. Two different <b>drinking</b> patterns <b>were</b> observed in Experiment 1. Pellet-induced drinking, characterized by high rates of postpellet drinking in the variable-time component, {{with little or no}} drinking in extinction, occurred when the acquisition of stable postpellet drinking preceded discrimination training. Stimulus-induced drinking, characterized by a burst of drinking at the onset of extinction, with no drinking during the variable-time schedule, occurred when discrimination training preceded all other experimental conditions. With extended training, stimulus-induced <b>drinking</b> eventually <b>was</b> accompanied by postpellet drinking. In Experiment 2, the rate of stimulus-induced drinking and the number of sessions during which it occurred without postpellet <b>drinking</b> <b>were</b> found to be inversely related to component duration. In Experiment 3, the rate of schedule-induced <b>drinking</b> <b>was</b> found to vary directly with component duration...|$|R

40|$|To {{examine whether}} the {{frequency}} and amount of alcohol consumed in binge drinking sessions, total annual volume of alcohol consumed, problem drinking and abstaining from alcohol are associated with depressive symptoms in Eastern Europe. Cross-sectional data from a total of 24, 381 participants from general population samples of the Czech Republic (N = 7, 601), Russia (N = 6, 908) and Poland (N = 9, 872) aged 45 - 69 years in 2002 - 2005. Depressive symptoms were defined as ≥ 16 points on the Centre for Epidemiological Studies - Depression (CES-D) scale. Several alcohol related measures were derived using responses from the graduated frequency questionnaire. Binge <b>drinking</b> <b>was</b> defined at several sex-specific thresholds (ranging from 60 + to 140 + g of ethanol) and two frequencies (at least monthly or weekly). Total annual alcohol intake in grams was also extracted. Problem <b>drinking</b> <b>was</b> defined as ≥ 2 positive answers on the CAGE questionnaire. Problem <b>drinking</b> <b>was</b> consistently associated with approximately a 2 -fold increase in odds of depressive symptoms across all countries and in both sexes. Abstaining from alcohol was typically associated with increased odds of depressive symptoms. Analyses separating lifelong abstainers and former drinkers in the Russian cohort revealed that this increased odds was driven by former drinkers. Amongst men, heavy frequent binge <b>drinking</b> <b>was</b> associated with increased odds of depressive symptoms in the Czech Republic and Poland. In women, heavy infrequent binge <b>drinking</b> <b>was</b> associated with increased odds of depressive symptoms in Russia and Poland. Only in Polish men was higher annual volume of alcohol intake associated with increased odds of depressive symptoms. Abstaining from alcohol and problem <b>drinking</b> <b>were</b> associated with increased odds of depressive symptoms in these Eastern European populations. Annual volume of alcohol intake as well as frequency and amount of alcohol consumed in a binge <b>drinking</b> session <b>were</b> less consistently associated with depressive symptoms...|$|R

40|$|Background:  Heavy {{drinking}} and smoking during pregnancy {{are known to have}} a negative impact on the unborn child. However, the impact of low-to-moderate alcohol consumption and binge <b>drinking</b> has <b>been</b> debated recently. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship of moderate prenatal {{drinking and}} binge drinking with birthweight, being small for gestational age (SGA) at birth, preterm birth, and neonatal asphyxia. Methods:  Moderate alcohol drinking, binge drinking, and several possible confounders were assessed in 1, 258 pregnant women; information on neonatal health was obtained at birth. Results:  Results indicate that 30. 8 % of the women drank at low levels ( 6. 35  mmol and/or Apgar score < 7 at 5  minutes). When controlling for maternal age, citizenship, occupational status, parity, smoking, use of prescription/over-the-counter drugs, illicit drug use, and child gender moderate <b>drinking</b> <b>was</b> related to lower birthweight (p <  0. 01), and moderate drinking and binge <b>drinking</b> <b>were</b> associated with neonatal asphyxia at trend level (p =  0. 06 and p =  0. 09). Moderate drinking and binge <b>drinking</b> <b>were</b> not related to length of gestation. Conclusions:  In contrast to recent reviews in the field, our results assume that moderate drinking and binge <b>drinking</b> <b>are</b> risk factors for neonatal health...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to investigate the association between various occupational stressors and heavy drinking among male Japanese workers in different age groups. Using the Generic Job Stress Questionnaire, 13 occupational stressors and 2 workplace support indicators were assessed. The questionnaire survey was conducted of 25, 104 workers, and the present study analyzed the data from 17, 501 male workers. Heavy <b>drinking</b> <b>was</b> defined as weekly alcohol consumption of> 275 g, and a total of 1, 131 men (6. 5 %) were classified as heavy drinkers. After adjusting for shift work, occupational class, marital status and smoking, heavy <b>drinking</b> <b>was</b> related to “support from supervisor ” for the 18 – 29 and 50 – 72 yr-old groups. For the 30 – 39 yr-old group, heavy <b>drinking</b> <b>was</b> related to “intragroup conflict”, “job control ” and “cognitive demands. ” For the 40 – 49 yr-old group, heavy <b>drinking</b> <b>was</b> related to “physical environment”, “quantitative workload ” and “underutilization of abilities. ” The present study clarified that certain occupational stressors relate to heavy drinking, and that this association varies among different age groups...|$|R

25|$|Impairments in impulse {{control in}} binge drinkers, {{which is more}} {{prominent}} in female binge drinkers, is due to dysfunction of the frontal lobe. The findings in humans have been largely concordant with animal studies. Such animal studies find that heavy and regular binge drinking causes neurodegeneration in corticolimbic brain regions areas {{that are involved in}} learning and spatial memory, such as the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, perirhinal cortex, entorhinal cortex, and the hippocampal dentate gyrus. A study in rats found that a heavy 2-day drinking binge caused extensive neurodegeneration in the entorhinal cortex with resultant learning deficits. While brain damage from binge <b>drinking</b> <b>is</b> known to occur as a result of binge drinking patterns, it is unclear how long drinking sessions last and how regular binge <b>drinking</b> <b>is</b> done to cause brain damage in humans. One study found that humans who drank at least 100 drinks (male) or 80 drinks (female) per month (concentrated to 21 occasions or less per month) throughout a 3-year period had impaired decision making skills compared to non-binge drinkers. Repeated acute withdrawal from alcohol, which occurs in heavy binge drinkers, has been shown in several studies to be associated with cognitive deficits as a result of neural kindling; neural kindling due to repeated withdrawals {{is believed to be the}} mechanism of cognitive damage in both binge drinkers and alcoholics. Neuronal kindling also leads to each subsequent acute withdrawal episode being more severe than previous withdrawal episodes.|$|E
