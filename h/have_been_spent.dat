5|$|On release, Halo 2 was {{the most}} popular video game on Xbox Live, holding that rank until the release of Gears of War for the Xbox 360 nearly two years later. By June 20, 2006, more than 500 million games of Halo 2 had been played and more than 710 million hours <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>spent</b> playing it on Xbox Live; by May 9, 2007, the number of unique players had risen to over five million. Halo 2 is the best-selling first-generation Xbox game with at least 6.3 million copies sold in the United States alone. The game {{received}} critical acclaim, with most publications lauding the strong multiplayer component. The campaign however, was the focus of criticism for its cliffhanger ending.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{congestion}} charge introduction in 2003, over £1.2 billion has been invested in transport through December 2013, including £960 million on {{improvements to the}} bus network; £102 million on roads and bridges; £70 million on road safety; £51 million on local transport/borough plans; and £36 million on sustainable transport and the environment. There has been criticism because during the first ten years since the scheme was implemented, gross revenue reached about £2.6 billion, but only £1.2 billion has been invested, meaning that 54% of gross revenues <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>spent</b> in operating the system and administrative expenses.|$|E
5|$|Spreckels and his {{partners}} William G. Irwin and F. F. Low formed the Spreckels & Company Bank in Hawaii in 1884, for the specific purpose of circulating the silver coins. The first Hawaiian silver coin known to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>spent,</b> a half dollar, was found among the receipts at the Honolulu Music Hall on January 10, 1884. It {{was placed in a}} pendant and given to the leading lady. The new coinage went into general circulation on January 14, with coins available at the Hawaiian Treasury and at Spreckels' new bank in Honolulu. There was considerable demand, and the coins (all of which were received by June 1884) displaced American quarter dollars and half dollars in circulation, something taken (depending on political position) to mean that they were accepted, or that Gresham's Law (bad money drives out good) was in operation. The Hawaiian Treasury had been almost out of cash before receiving the coins, and they entered commerce as the government paid for goods and services, increasing the money supply and risking inflation. Within six months of issue, the coins traded against American currency at a discount of 2 percent.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} was controversial in Lillehammer, both amongst {{the general public}} and politicians. The chief of administration had doubted whether he should recommend construction. The original plans had called for both a large and normal hill, but lack of funding meant that the normal hill was never built, meaning that the number of competitions in the hill would be severely limited. The cost overruns were largely created by errors in the plans, which estimated too little earthwork to fill the hillside, and not enough blasting. To cut costs, a floodlighting system was taken out of the plans, so the venue could not be used during the evenings, limiting the amount of time the venue could be used. It was also a concern that very few locals were able to jump on such a large hill. Many politicians stated in 1972 that the money should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>spent</b> instead on an indoor hall for handball. The first trial jump was made by Helge Nordstrand, while Jan Stenbekk is credited with the first hill record, at 110.5meters.|$|E
25|$|The lack of {{affordable}} housing in urban areas means that money that could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>spent</b> on food is spent on housing expenses. Housing is generally considered affordable when it costs 30% or less of total household income; rising housing costs have made this ideal difficult to attain.|$|E

The contract was highly criticized, because it tied up valuable payroll space that could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>spent</b> to improve other areas, such as pitching.|$|E
