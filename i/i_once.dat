5|$|After her commissioning, Karlsruhe was {{assigned}} to overseas duties in the Caribbean. She arrived {{in the area in}} July 1914, days before the outbreak of World War <b>I.</b> <b>Once</b> the war began, she armed the passenger liner , but while the ships were transferring equipment, British ships located them and pursued Karlsruhe. Her superior speed allowed her to escape, after which she operated off the northeastern coast of Brazil. Here, she captured or sank sixteen ships. While en route to attack the shipping lanes to Barbados on 4 November 1914, a spontaneous internal explosion destroyed the ship and killed the majority of the crew. The survivors used one of Karlsruhes colliers to return to Germany in December 1914.|$|E

One by one they passed in front of me, teachers, friends, others, all those I had been afraid of, all those <b>I</b> <b>once</b> could have laughed at, all those I had lived with over the years. They went by, fallen, dragging their packs, dragging their lives, deserting their homes, the years of their childhood, cringing like beaten dogs.|$|E
5|$|In 1513 James IV {{launched}} {{an invasion of}} England, attempting {{to take advantage of}} the absence of the English King Henry VIII. His forces met with disaster at Flodden Field; the King, many senior noblemen, and hundreds of soldiers were killed. As his son and successor, James V, was an infant, the government was again taken over by regents. James V led another disastrous war with the English in 1542, and his death in the same year left the Crown in the hands of his six-day-old daughter, Mary <b>I.</b> <b>Once</b> again, a regency was established.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} between the various extant manuscripts is complex, and a definitive scheme of how the various manuscripts {{relate to each other}} cannot be made. Blake, in his edition of the Liber, suggests that Book <b>I</b> <b>once</b> existed as a stand-alone work, which influenced the B manuscript. A separate Book II, with parts of Book III, was then written and combined with the stand-alone Book I, into either manuscript E or an earlier version of that manuscript. Book II was then revised, combined with parts of G, Book I, and parts of E to make manuscript F.|$|E
5|$|With Goya we do {{not think}} of the studio or even of the artist at work. We think only of the event.

5|$|Despite the {{restoration}} to Byzantine rule, relations between Thessalonica and Constantinople remained troubled, with Thessalonica's local aristocracy jealously guarding their extensive privileges, which apparently amounted to virtual autonomy. This {{was part of}} a wider phenomenon for several cities during the last century of Byzantine history, as the state's central authority weakened. In Thessalonica's case, a tendency of independence from the imperial capital had been evident at least since the Zealot movement of the mid-14th century, and had been reinforced by Manuel II's autonomous regime in 1382–1387. Thus, Thessalonica and the surrounding region were given as an autonomous appanage to John VII Palaiologos. After his death in 1408, he was succeeded by Manuel's third son, the Despot Andronikos Palaiologos, who was supervised by Demetrios Leontares until 1415. During this time, Thessalonica enjoyed a period of relative peace and prosperity, as the Turks were preoccupied with their own civil war, but was attacked by the rival Ottoman pretenders in 1412 (by Musa Çelebi) and 1416 (during the uprising of Mustafa Çelebi against Mehmed <b>I).</b> <b>Once</b> the Ottoman civil war ended, the Turkish pressure on the city began to increase again. Just as during the 1383–1387 siege, this led to a sharp division of opinion within the city between factions supporting resistance, if necessary with Western help, or submission to the Ottomans.|$|E

25|$|Nimzovich {{suffered}} from the delusion that he was unappreciated and that the reason was malice. All it took to make him blossom, as I later learned, was a little praise. His paranoia was most evident when he dined in company. He always thought he was served much smaller portions than everyone else. He didn't care about the actual amount but only about the imagined affront. <b>I</b> <b>once</b> suggested that he and I order what the other actually wanted and, when the food was served, exchange plates. After we had done so, {{he shook his head}} in disbelief, still thinking that he had received the smaller portion.|$|E
25|$|Self-reducibility {{describes}} the phenomenon that, {{if we can}} quickly test whether a SAT instance is solvable, we can almost as quickly find an explicit solution to the instance. To {{find a solution to}} an instance s, choose one of the Boolean variables x that is input to s, and make two smaller instances s0 and s1 where s'i denotes the formula formed by replacing x with the constant <b>i.</b> <b>Once</b> these two smaller instances have been constructed, apply the test for solvability to each of them. If one of these two tests returns that the smaller instance is satisfiable, continue solving that instance until a complete solution has been derived.|$|E

25|$|I {{believe that}} poor and {{vulnerable}} families will fare much better under the Labour Party {{than they would}} under a Cameron-led Conservative Party. Gordon Brown has consistently prioritised and introduced measures that will save as many children as possible from a life lacking in opportunity or choice. The Labour government has reversed the long-term trend in child poverty, {{and is one of}} the leading EU countries in combating child poverty. David Cameron's promise of tax perks for the married, on the other hand, is reminiscent of the Conservative government I experienced as a lone parent. It sends the message that the Conservatives still believe a childless, dual-income, but married couple is more deserving of a financial pat on the head than those struggling, as <b>I</b> <b>once</b> was, to keep their families afloat in difficult times.|$|E
25|$|In 1160, Malcolm {{returned}} to Scotland having spent months campaigning {{in the service}} of the English on the Continent. After successfully dealing with a considerable number of disaffected magnates at Perth, the Chronicle of Holyrood and the twelfththirteenth-century Chronicle of Melrose reveal that he launched three military expeditions into Galloway. The circumstances surrounding these invasions is unclear, although what is clear is that Fergus submitted to the Scots before the end of the year. Specifically, according to Gesta Annalia <b>I,</b> <b>once</b> the Scots subdued the Gallovidians, the conquerors forced Fergus to retire to the abbey of Holyrood, and hand over his son, Uhtred, as a royal hostage. The Chronicle of Holyrood and the fifteenth-century Ordinale of Holyrood corroborate Fergus' monastic retirement, with the former source further recording Fergus' grant of the lands of Dunrod to the abbey.|$|E
25|$|Phinehas is said {{never to}} have {{accepted}} {{an invitation to a}} meal and, after he had attained his majority, to have refused to eat at the table of his father. The reason given by him for this course of conduct was that {{there are two kinds of}} people: (1) those who are willing to be hospitable, but can not afford to be so, and (2) those who have the means but are not willing to extend hospitality to others (Hul. 7b). Judah <b>I</b> <b>once</b> invited him to a meal, and exceptionally he decided to accept the invitation; but on arriving at the house of the patriarch he noticed in the yard mules of a certain kind the use of which was forbidden by local custom on account of the danger in handling them.

25|$|The gold {{standard}} was suspended twice during World War <b>I,</b> <b>once</b> fully {{and then for}} foreign exchange. At {{the onset of the}} war, U.S. corporations had large debts payable to European entities, who began liquidating their debts in gold. With debts looming to Europe, the dollar to British pound exchange rate reached as high as $6.75, far above the (gold) parity of $4.8665. This caused large gold outflows until July 31, 1914, when the New York Stock Exchange closed and the {{gold standard}} was temporarily suspended. In order to defend the exchange value of the dollar, the US Treasury Department authorized state and nationally chartered banks to issue emergency currency under the Aldrich-Vreeland Act, and the newly created Federal Reserve organized a fund to assure debts to foreign creditors. These efforts were largely successful, and the Aldrich-Vreeland notes were retired starting in November and the gold standard was restored when the New York Stock Exchange re-opened in December 1914.|$|E
