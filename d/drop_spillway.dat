50|$|The Boulder Canyon Project Act in 1928 would signal {{change for}} the Yuma Project. The Act {{authorized}} {{the construction of the}} Hoover Dam which curtailed flooding on the Colorado River but it also authorized the All-American Canal and the Imperial Dam. The Imperial Dam would serve as the lower Colorado's diversion dam and would also supply the Yuma Project with water. The dam was completed in 1938 and in 1941, the Bureau of Reclamation sealed off the Yuma Main Canal from the Laguna Diversion Dam. All outlets from the Laguna Dam were sealed on June 23, 1948 allowing for full supply from the Imperial Dam. Becoming obsolete, the Bureau decommissioned the power plant at the Siphon <b>Drop</b> <b>Spillway</b> in 1972.|$|E
50|$|Construction on the Yuma Canal which {{branched}} off the California {{side of the}} Laguna Dam {{began in}} 1909. One and half miles from the dam, at Indian Heading, the Yuma Canal splits into the Reservation Main Canal and the Yuma Main Canal. The Yuma Main Canal continues 10.5 mi southwest until it reaches the 9.9 ft Siphon <b>Drop</b> <b>Spillway</b> where a power plant was later built in 1926. After another 3.5 mi, it reaches the Colorado River Siphon which siphons the water under the Colorado River. After it reaches Yuma, it split into the East and West Main canals {{to pass through the}} Valley Division and to the Mexican border. The Yuma Main Canal along with the East Main Canal and part of the West Main Canal were complete by 1912. The rest of the West Main Canal started again in 1913 and was completed in 1915.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contains}} sufficient {{information to}} permit the complete hydraulic design of a box inlet <b>drop</b> <b>spillway</b> and explains briefly the various factors that influence the design. Its four major sections deal with the free flow capacity, the outlet design, the submerged flow capacity, and the utilization of the preceding information {{in the design of}} box inlet drop spillways. The box inlet <b>drop</b> <b>spillway</b> may be described as a rectangular box open at the top and at the downstream end. The spillway is shown in the Frontispiece and in Figure 1. Storm runoff is directed to the box by dikes and headwalls, enters over the upstream end and two sides, and leaves through the open downstream end. An outlet structure is attached to the downstream end of the box. The long crest of the box inlet permits large flows to pass over it with relatively low heads, yet the width of the spillway need be no greater than that of the exit channel...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} the generalized design rules for a new stilling basin for use with the straight <b>drop</b> <b>spillway.</b> This generalized stilling basin design was developed because experience in the field had shown that there was no satisfactory stilling basin for the straight <b>drop</b> <b>spillway.</b> However, limited field experience indicates that this new design will adequately protect the downstream channel from scour. Water falling over the spillway crest falls onto a flat apron. The nappe is broken up by floor blocks, which also prevent damaging scour of the downstream channel banks. Scour of the downstream channel bed is prevented by an end still. Flaring wingwalls, triangular in elevation, prevent erosion of the dam fill. For proper operation of the stilling basin, the contraction of the flow at the ends of the spillway opening must be partially suppressed. The stilling basin can be used {{for a wide range of}} discharge, head on the crest, crest length, height of drop, and downstream tailwater level. An important finding is that the stilling basin length computed for the minimum tailwater levels. Dangerous scour of the downstream channel may occur if the nappe is supported sufficiently by high tailwater so that it lands beyond the end of the stilling basin. A method of computing the stilling basin length for all tailwater levels is presented. The design rules developed as a result of the laboratory tests were carefully checked an verified. An example shows how these rules are applied to the design of field structure.

40|$|The baffle type energy {{dissipator}} {{described in this}} paper was developed through laboratory experimentation for use in soil conservation work. It is designed to reduce the energy in high velocity pipe flow so that the water may be discharged safely into an erodible channel. This structure {{can be adapted to}} meet the many field conditions encountered in erosion control work in agriculture and elsewhere, such as at pipe outlets draining terraces or ditches, highway culverts, and <b>drop</b> inlet <b>spillway</b> outlets. Pipe sizes commonly used in such applications range from 10 to 48 in in diameter and have flows from 10 to 250 cfs discharging into channels of various widths...|$|R
40|$|The box inlet <b>drop</b> <b>spillway</b> {{is defined}} as a {{rectangular}} box open at the top and at the downstream end. The spillway is shown in Figure 1. Storm runoff is directed to the box by dikes and headwalls, enters over the upstream end and two sides, and leaves through the open downstream end. An outlet structure is attached to the downstream end of the box. The long crest of the box inlet permits large flows to pass over it with relatively low heads, yet the width of the spillway need be no greater than that of the exit channel. the <b>drop</b> <b>spillway</b> has been extensively used as a gully control structure where it is necessary to drop water from as short a distance as 2 feet to as much as 12 feet. In more recent years it has also been used in drainage ditches where it functions as a title outlet and means of dropping excess surface water into the ditch. For the sake of economy, auxiliary vegetated spillways are sometimes provided to pass part of the runoff from the larger storms and to permit the use of smaller mechanical spillway. In order to prevent scour of the drainage ditch banks the elevations of the vegetated spillways are adjusted so no water will pass over them until the downstream drainage ditch flows back full. In other words, the mechanical spillway must have sufficient capacity to fill the ditch completely before any flow passes over the vegetated spillway. Under these conditions the high downstream water level will likely submerge the spillway and reduce its flow. After the vegetated spillways come into operation, the downstream level rises still further and submergence of the mechanical spillway becomes greater. Spillways designed in this manner are known as the "island dam" type because they can be completely surrounded by water during flood periods. The necessity for these studies to determine the capacity of box inlet drop spillways under submerged flow conditions thus becomes apparent...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Abrupt {{changes of}} the channel bed {{elevation}} in hydraulic systems, e. g. in chutes, <b>drops</b> and steeped <b>spillways,</b> results to create a sever flow kinematic energy. This excess energy, can tend to different phenomena, such as tremendous forces, scouring and degrading the channel bed, resulting to destruction of the downstream hydraulic structures. The most important source to cause this phenomena is the the existence of sequent vertical drops along the the channel. In this study, the energy dissipation efficiency was increased by installing {{a new type of}} dissipaters namely netting dissipater on the crest of the vertical drops based on model experimtation. Also, the features of hydraulic jump, created in the stilling basin, were compared to those of a simple vertical drop. By assembling the above mentioned structure {{to the top of the}} stilling basin, the jet flow direction is changed, the degree of turbulence is increased and as the results, the kinematic energy loss increases and the length of the hydraulic jump decreses. The enhanced efficiency of the proposed structure was quantified based on the achieved experimental data...|$|R
