500|$|Producers {{created a}} new storyline in October 2015 when Les Coker (Roger Sloman) was {{revealed}} to the audience as a crossdresser, going {{by the name of}} Christine. Les's wife, Pam Coker (Lin Blakley), struggles with this and ends their marriage. In one of several attempts to win Pam back, Les burns all of Christine's belongings. Babe witnesses this and steals a half-burnt photograph of Christine. Badland said that Babe is [...] "quite Dickensian in the way that she finds things and slips them <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>pocket</b> to use against people!" [...] The storyline was revisited in May 2016 when Babe begins anonymously blackmailing Les and Pam in exchange for her silence. Of Babe's motivation to blackmail the Cokers, Badland said that [...] "Babe hasn't got any respect for Pam and Les and she's using them to get money. It's as simple as that really." [...] She also said that she [...] "resents seeing [...] and Pam together as a unit" [...] after he rejects her romantic advances, because she has [...] "never had what they have".|$|E

5000|$|In 1943, she {{was moved}} to the Santo Tomas Internment Camp in Manila. It was there that she and several other imprisoned nurses earned the title [...] "Angels in Fatigues" [...] from fellow captives. For the next several months, she {{provided}} medical help to the prisoners and sought to feed starving children by shoving food <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>pockets</b> whenever she could, often going hungry herself. As she lost weight, she used the room in her uniform for smuggling surgical equipment into the prisoner-of-war camp. At the camp she assisted in 230 operations and helped to deliver 13 children.|$|R
6000|$|I saw the indignation {{rising in}} the old woman's face. She was insulted. This boy was making fun of her. That was her thought. She thrust <b>her</b> hands <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>pockets</b> and {{straightened}} up {{to give him a}} piece of her mind. Her temper was all up, and hot. Her mouth came open and let out three words of a bitter sentence,... then it fell silent, and the anger in her face turned to surprise or wonder or fear, or something, and she slowly brought out her hands from <b>her</b> <b>pockets</b> and opened them and held them so. In one was my piece of money, in the other lay four silver groschen. She gazed a little while, perhaps to see if the groschen would vanish away; then she said, fervently: ...|$|R
60|$|On that eventful evening Rebecca {{went to bed}} rather {{earlier than}} usual. Kate retired to her room, and having made her final {{preparations}} and stuffed her few articles of jewelry <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>pockets,</b> to serve in place of money, she lay down upon her bed, and trembled {{at the thought of}} what was in front of her. Down below she could hear her guardian's shuffling step as he moved about the refectory. Then came the creaking of the rusty lock as he secured the door, and shortly afterwards he passed upstairs to his room. Mrs. Jorrocks had also gone to bed, and all was quiet in the house.|$|R
60|$|Amy {{held her}} tongue, but used her eyes, and saw Meg slip a fan <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>pocket.</b>|$|E

60|$|Sylvia took a rapid {{glance at}} the hundred-pound-note, and {{twisting}} it <b>into</b> <b>her</b> little <b>pocket</b> with apparent sangfroid, though she held it with a tight grasp, murmured that it was quite unnecessary, and then offered to give her new lodger an acknowledgment of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{one thing}} to say she's an impostor behind her back, and another thing to prove it to her face," [...] remarked the nurse. She put her hand as she spoke <b>into</b> <b>her</b> apron <b>pocket,</b> and, with a {{significant}} look at her mistress, silently produced a second letter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Prettyman told me I {{was to come}} to her," [...] said Grace, who {{had already}} taken some small sum from the schoolmistress, which at once had gone <b>into</b> <b>her</b> mother's <b>pocket,</b> and <b>into</b> {{household}} purposes. [...] "She said I should be sure to go to Allington, and that of course I should go to her, as I must pass through Silverbridge." ...|$|R

5000|$|After a {{four-year}} hiatus, in 2003 Winans release Bringing It All Together which featured [...] "Shake Yourself Loose", written and produced by her son, Mario. Leaving nothing to chance, she dipped deep <b>into</b> <b>her</b> own <b>pockets</b> {{to create a}} marketing strategy that most gospel labels would never spend on a project. She spent well over $200,000 creating five music videos, hiring independent radio teams, promotional marketing teams and creating a 50 city-promotional concert tour to launch the CD.|$|R
2500|$|Just {{like she}} did before on her {{previous}} projects Sugar & Spice and Beauty & the Streets Vol. 1, Harrison served as executive producer for K.I.S.S which entailed her scouting the producers, songwriters, arranging the album track listing, and {{keeping track of the}} accounting. Her fifth studio album Sugar & Spice was catered more to Japan's distinct sound and market, but approaching K.I.S.S., she wanted to make a classic Mýa album even if it meant digging deeper <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>pockets.</b> K.I.S.S. has a balance of mid-tempos, up-tempos, slow jams and great production. [...] "As fun as this album is, there's also lots of substance to be discovered lyrically, without getting bored or depressed", she described. In an interview with 4Eight Media, she said, [...] "The creative process was a combination of including songs that I had in my archive for years in addition to travelling across the U.S. and Jamaica to work with different producers and artists. She chose the songs that best worked together sonically & arranged the track listing of the album accordingly." [...] Harrison used a few songs on the album that have existed in her archive {{for a couple of years}} that finally found the appropriate place to reside. The entire album with the new material took her about 5 months to assemble & complete. Between October 2010 & February 2011.|$|R
60|$|To {{return to}} Fairview. Victoria, after sharing her five o'clock luncheon with her dogs, went to seek her father, {{for the purpose}} (if it must be told) of asking him for a cheque. Mr. Flint was at Fairview on the average of two days out of the week during the summer, {{and then he was}} nearly always closeted with a {{secretary}} and two stenographers and a long-distance telephone in two plain little rooms {{at the back of the}} house. And Mr. Hilary Vane was often in consultation with him, as he was on the present occasion when Victoria flung open the door. At sight of Mr. Vane she halted suddenly on the threshold, and a gleam of mischief came <b>into</b> <b>her</b> eye as she thrust <b>her</b> hand <b>into</b> <b>her</b> coat <b>pocket.</b> The two regarded her with the detached air of men whose thread of thought has been broken.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a little}} more to the same purpose, and when she slipped the letter <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>pocket</b> Hetty Torrance smiled.|$|E

50|$|In 2012, {{a student}} at University of California at Berkeley sued the {{sorority}} after experiencing hazing so bad that {{she was forced to}} drop out of school. She was told by members of the sorority that prospective members are not hazed, however she eventually learned that was a lie. In her lawsuit, she stated she had <b>her</b> head slammed <b>into</b> a wall, <b>her</b> <b>pockets</b> ripped from <b>her</b> jeans, she was beat over the head while being forced to recite the sorority's history, forced to clean up juice with only her back, and was subject to other illegal hazing activities.|$|R
60|$|Gerty had an idea, one of love's little ruses. She {{slipped a}} hand <b>into</b> <b>her</b> kerchief <b>pocket</b> {{and took out}} the wadding and waved in reply of course without letting him and then slipped it back. Wonder if he's too far to. She rose. Was it goodbye? No. She had to go but they would meet again, there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her dream of yester eve. She drew herself up to her full height. Their souls met in a last {{lingering}} glance and the eyes that reached her heart, full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face. She half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a smile that verged on tears, and then they parted.|$|R

Afterwards, they walk together {{to get around the}} [...] "discuss no past" [...] ground rules, and Lizzie tells the stranger about Frankie's deafness—a [...] "present from his daddy"—and her reason for leaving her husband. She explains that the letters from Frankie are so important to her because this is how she [...] "hears" [...] her son. The stranger tells her she is a great mother for protecting Frankie.

6000|$|... "Thanks," [...] said Elinor, indifferently, {{putting the}} note <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>pocket.</b> She liked Marian's letters, and kept {{them to read}} in her hours of solitude.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, the money," [...] {{said the}} Egyptian scornfully. She {{put her hand}} <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>pocket</b> confidently, as if used to well-filled purses, but could only draw out two silver pieces.|$|E
500|$|Jim is left feeling {{uncertain}} {{about the fate}} of his special present for Pam—which is eventually claimed by Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson)—while the staff competes for the iPod.

60|$|The {{old lady}} began to rummage in <b>her</b> <b>pocket</b> for <b>her</b> spectacles. But Oliver's {{patience}} was not proof against this new trial; and yielding {{to his first}} impulse, he sprang <b>into</b> <b>her</b> arms.|$|R
60|$|He {{slipped a}} {{crumpled}} note <b>into</b> <b>her</b> fingers, so quietly and unostentatiously {{that it was}} there and in <b>her</b> <b>pocket</b> before any one had time to notice it. She went out murmuring to herself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{how did you}} know?" [...] said Cordy, blushing, as she bounced out of her luxurious {{seat and}} whisked <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>pocket</b> the paper of {{chocolate}} creams she was seldom without.|$|E
6000|$|... "Police!" [...] said Miss Pilbeam, in {{a thrilling}} whisper. The skipper {{stepped into the}} {{cupboard}} without further parley, and the girl, turning the key, slipped it <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>pocket</b> and sped downstairs.|$|E
60|$|Her fingers {{disclosed}} {{the little}} ornament she was carrying--a tiny pistol. She slipped it back <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>pocket.</b> The man {{was wondering how}} {{such a thing as}} this came to be his daughter.|$|E
25|$|Rossakoff {{arrives at}} Poirot's flat. She happily confesses to Poirot that {{she put the}} jewels in the professor's pocket as she had found them in her own bag when the raid started, and {{so she had to}} get rid of them as quickly as she could. It was Varesco who planted them on her and she admits that he is the true owner of the premises. Poirot takes <b>her</b> <b>into</b> the next room where Higgs and Cerberus are waiting. Higgs can handle any dog and took the {{otherwise}} fierce animal out during the raid. Poirot asks Rossakoff to order the obedient dog to drop what it is holding in its mouth and it does so. A small sealed packet of cocaine drops to the ground. A shocked Rossakoff loudly proclaims her innocence and Poirot says he believes her – the true criminal is Alice who is in league with Verasco. She carried the drugs in <b>her</b> large skirt <b>pockets</b> and dropped them <b>into</b> <b>her</b> clients' <b>pockets</b> on the dance floor. When the raid occurred and the lights went out temporarily, Poirot was waiting by Cerberus and heard her put the packet in the dog's mouth – and Poirot took the opportunity to cut off a sample of cloth from her sleeve as proof.|$|R
50|$|Kate and Juliet {{continue}} to the barracks; however, the monster returns. They take off running, and come upon the pylons. Kate jerks Juliet {{to a stop}} and says they cannot go through them. Juliet reaches <b>into</b> <b>her</b> back <b>pocket,</b> takes out a key, and unlocks the cuffs. She then runs to a pylon, enters an access code on a key pad, and they run across the barrier. Juliet jams the setting into the red zone. The monster zooms in and bounces off the barrier. It roils and rises, making awful noises, and is unable to pass through the fence. Then it quickly shoots away. Juliet admits that they do not know what it is, but they do know it does not like their fence. Kate asks about the key. Juliet says she was left behind, too, and by people she knew and trusted. She hoped that if Kate thought they were in it together, Kate would not leave her behind in the jungle like they did. Kate unlocks her cuff, and they continue on.|$|R
