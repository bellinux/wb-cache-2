500|$|During 1897, Dunne {{sometimes}} set {{his sights}} overseas, discussing Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. Dooley noted that while the sun never set on her domains, the original owners did not get to [...] "set" [...] there either, [...] "bein' kept movin' be the polis [...] ". Late that year, Dunne moved to the Chicago Journal as managing editor and Mr. Dooley began to comment at his new venue in early 1898. Dunne had been limited at his old position by Kohlsaat's insistence that his papers support President McKinley's efforts to settle differences with Spain over Cuba short of war. [...] At the Journal, where the journalism was yellow and shrill appeals for war the norm, Dunne labored under no such inhibitions. He had always turned away praise of the Dooley pieces from those aware of his authorship, wishing {{to be known as}} a serious writer. Because of the dialect, the Dooley columns were more difficult for him than writing editorials and columns <b>in</b> <b>plain</b> <b>English.</b> He had ended his last Dooley piece at the Post with the barkeeper bidding farewell, locking the saloon door (as Dunne put it) [...] "perhaps for the last time", possibly meaning that Dooley was done. Dooley had been depicted as in favor of war against Spain in the Post, and Dunne favored military intervention to free Cuba. [...] On February 19, 1898, four days after the USS Maine sank in Havana harbor, Dunne restored Dooley to his arsenal against the Spanish. [...] Fanning wrote of Mr. Dooley's subsequent howls for war: [...] "bandoning his usual stance as a cool and neutral ironist, Mr. Dooley becomes one more loud, irrational voice expressing cruelly simplified hatred of Spain and anger at President McKinley. These new pieces mark the low point in the Dooley canon, for in them Dunne shatters the persona that he has built up s had moderated his position, even if the Journal had not. [...] On April 16, Dunne had Dooley paint a mocking portrait of Fitzhugh Lee, the U.S. consul in Havana whose belligerent reports were fueling the drive to war, in a column printed while the Journal editorial page was praising Lee. But the real breakthrough was after the Battle of Manila Bay on May 1. That a battle had taken place was known, but as the American commander, Admiral George Dewey, was believed to have severed the cable lines, no word came to the United States, and the nation waited in suspense, fearing defeat. [...] Then, news that Dewey had destroyed the dilapidated Spanish fleet arrived, but the details, and the fate of Dewey and his ships and men, were unknown. Before word came from Dewey that he had not lost a ship or man appeared the May 7 Mr. Dooley piece, [...] "On His Cousin George", that is the admiral, for [...] "Dewey or Dooley, 'tis all th' same". Dooley predicted that [...] "he'll write home and say he's got the islands; and he'll turn them over to the government and go back to his ship, and Mark Hanna'll organize the Philippine Islands Jute and Cider Company, and the revolutionists'll wish they hadn't. That's what'll happen. Mark my word." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{conclusion}} of a Cochrane Database Systematic Review, which included these two studies and five others, was that combining ACEi treatment with ARB was not effective in reducing total mortality RR 0.98 [...] or cardiovascular mortality RR 0.93 [...] when compared with single therapy of an ACEi. Combined therapy did reduce HF-related hospital admissions with an absolute risk reduction of 4.4% but also increased discontinuation of medication due to adverse effects with an absolute risk increase of 3.7%. <b>In</b> <b>plain</b> <b>English,</b> 23 people {{would need to be}} treated to reduce one hospitalisation for HF while treating 27 people would harm one person with adverse effects. Thus, combined therapy does not improve mortality and may slightly increase morbidity.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the years}} that followed, the {{interests}} of the Jackson Heights community and the Queensboro Corporation were closely intertwined. [...] The local newspaper sometimes sounded like the voice of the corporation. [...] The corporation encouraged development of the commercial area that surrounded the 82nd Street subway station, and assisted in setting up a community board to ensure the growth of civic institutions. MacDougall also donated land for churches. Part of the model in the early years, which broke down with the Great Depression of the 1930s, was [...] "a policy of reasonable restriction in accepting tenants thus bringing together tenants having ideals and living standards in common." [...] <b>In</b> <b>plain</b> <b>English,</b> this meant that Jews, Blacks, and perhaps Greeks and Italians were excluded from the community. Only white Anglo-Saxon Protestants were welcome.|$|E

2500|$|In 1984, Gerhard Frey {{noticed an}} {{apparent}} link {{between these two}} previously unrelated and unsolved problems. An outline suggesting this could be proved was given by Frey. The full proof that the two problems were closely linked, was accomplished in 1986 by Ken Ribet building on a partial proof by Jean-Pierre Serre who proved all but one part known as the [...] "epsilon conjecture" [...] (see: Ribet's Theorem and Frey curve). <b>In</b> <b>plain</b> <b>English,</b> these papers by Frey, Serre and Ribet showed that if the Modularity Theorem could be proven {{for at least the}} semi-stable class of elliptic curves, a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem would also follow automatically. The connection is described below: any solution that could contradict Fermat's Last Theorem could also be used to contradict the Modularity Theorem. So if the modularity theorem were found to be true, then by definition no solution contradicting Fermat's Last Theorem could exist, which would therefore have to be true as well.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to its predecessors, very few [...] "source" [...] tracks {{are used in}} the film. Aside from Don Davis' score, again collaborating with Juno Reactor, only one external track (by Pale 3) is used. Although Davis rarely focuses on strong melodies, familiar leitmotifs from earlier in the series reappear. For example, Neo and Trinity's love theme—which briefly surfaces in the two preceding films—is finally fully expanded into [...] "Trinity Definitely"; the theme from the Zion docks in Reloaded returns as [...] "Men in Metal", and the energetic drumming from the Reloaded tea house fight between Neo and Seraph opens [...] "Tetsujin", as Seraph, Trinity and Morpheus fight off Club Hel's three doormen. The climactic battle theme, named [...] "Neodämmerung" [...] (in reference to Wagner's Götterdämmerung), features a choir singing extracts (shlokas) from the Upanishads. The chorus can be roughly translated from Sanskrit as follows: [...] "lead us from untruth to truth, lead us from darkness to light, lead us from death to immortality, peace peace peace". The extracts were brought to Davis by the Wachowskis when he informed them that it would be wasteful for such a large choir to be singing simple [...] "ooh"s and [...] "aah"s (according to the DVD commentary, Davis felt that the dramatic impact of the piece would be lost if the choir was to sing 'This is the one, see what he can do' <b>in</b> <b>plain</b> <b>English).</b> These extracts return in the film's denouement, and in Navras, the track that plays over the closing credits (which may be considered a loose remix of [...] "Neodämmerung").|$|E
