40|$|Roll {{compaction}} is {{a continuous}} process {{commonly used in}} the pharmaceutical industry for dry granulation of moisture and heat sensitive powder blends. It is intended to increase bulk density and improve flowability. Roll compaction is a complex process that depends on many factors, such as feed powder properties, processing conditions and system layout. Some of the variability in the process remains unexplained. Accordingly, modeling tools are needed to understand the properties and the interrelations between raw materials, process parameters {{and the quality of}} the product. It is important to look at the whole manufacturing chain from raw materials to tablet properties. The main objective of this thesis was to investigate the impact of raw materials, process parameters and system design variations on the quality of intermediate and final roll compaction products, as well as their interrelations. In order to do so, we have conducted a series of systematic experimental studies and utilized chemometric tools, such as design of experiments, latent variable models (i. e. PCA, OPLS and O 2 PLS) as well as mechanistic models based on the rolling theory of granular solids developed by Johanson (1965). More specifically, we have developed a modeling approach to elucidate the influence of different brittle filler qualities of mannitol and dicalcium phosphate and their physical properties (i. e. flowability, particle size and compactability) on intermediate and final product quality. This approach allows the possibility of introducing new fillers without additional experiments, provided that they are within the previously mapped design space. Additionally, this approach is generic and could be extended beyond fillers. Furthermore, in contrast to many other materials, the results revealed that some qualities of the investigated fillers demonstrated improved compactability following roll compaction. In one study, we identified the design space for a roll compaction process using a risk-based approach. The influence of process parameters (i. e. roll force, roll speed, roll gap and milling screen size) on different ribbon, granule and tablet properties was evaluated. In another study, we demonstrated the significant added value of the combination of near-infrared chemical imaging, texture analysis and multivariate methods in the quality assessment of the intermediate and final roll compaction products. Finally, we have also studied the roll compaction of an intermediate drug load formulation at different scales and using roll compactors with different feed screw mechanisms (i. e. horizontal and vertical). The horizontal feed screw roll compactor was also equipped with an instrumented roll technology allowing the measurement of normal stress on ribbon. Ribbon porosity was primarily found to be a function of normal stress, exhibiting a quadratic relationship. A similar quadratic relationship was also observed between roll force and ribbon porosity of the vertically <b>fed</b> <b>roll</b> compactor. A combination of design of experiments, latent variable and mechanistic models led to a better understanding of the critical process parameters and showed that scale up/transfer between equipment is feasible...|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the following study were to compare a recently developed low lignin- high fat oat with regular oat as an energy source for use in diets fed to growing-finishing pigs and to compare hammer milling and roller milling as methods of processing oats. A total of 40 crossbred grower pigs (20 barrows and 20 gilts) were {{assigned to one of}} five dietary treatments in a factorial design experiment. The control diet was formulated using barley and soybean meal while four experimental diets were formulated in which 40 % of either normal or low lignin-high fat oat was substituted for barley. The oats were either ground or rolled. Particle size analysis indicated that the average particle size of the grower diets was 884, 1037, 1420, 1031 and 1501 m while for the finisher diets, the average particle size was 800, 869, 1250, 854 and 1098 m for the barley, ground normal oat, rolled normal oat, ground low lignin-high fat oat and rolled low lignin-high fat oat diets respectively. Digestibility coefficients for pigs fed ground oats were significantly (p 0. 05) in nutrient digestibility between pigs fed normal and low lignin-high fat oat. During the growing period (35. 1 to 71. 4 kg) as well as over the entire experiment (35. 1 to 112. 5 kg), there were no differences (p> 0. 05) in daily gain, feed intake or feed conversion between pigs fed normal or low lignin-high fat oat or between pigs <b>fed</b> ground or <b>rolled</b> oat diets. During the finishing period (71. 4 to 112. 5 kg), feed intake and feed conversion were poorer (p< 0. 05) for pigs fed the low lignin-high fat oat compared with the barley diet. There were no differences in carcass traits between pigs fed normal and low lignin-high fat oat or between pigs <b>fed</b> <b>rolled</b> and ground oats. The overall results of this experiment indicate that both normal and low lignin-high fat oat can substitute for barley at levels as high as 40 % of the diet without hindering pig performance. Since the average yield of oat can be equal or higher than barley with lower input costs, a re-examination of feeding recommendations regarding oat in swine rations seems warranted. In addition, since pig performance and carcass traits were not affected by processing method and roller mills have been shown to have lower-energy requirements, lower maintenance costs, quieter operation, and more exact control of particle size than hammer mills, there may be some advantage for pig producers to consider roller mills rather than hammer mills for use in processing pig feeds...|$|R

We quantified the behavior of lacewing larvae on crested wheatgrass plants bearing either D. noxia alone or an equal mixture of D. noxia and R. padi.

60|$|But we {{must return}} to our more {{immediate}} subject. I am convinced that Forbes's view may be largely extended. In Europe we meet with the plainest evidence of the Glacial period, from the western shores of Britain to the Ural range, and southward to the Pyrenees. We may infer from the frozen mammals {{and nature of the}} mountain vegetation, that Siberia was similarly affected. In the Lebanon, according to Dr. Hooker, perpetual snow formerly covered the central axis, and <b>fed</b> glaciers which <b>rolled</b> 4,000 feet down the valleys. The same observer has recently found great moraines at a low level on the Atlas range in North Africa. Along the Himalaya, at points 900 miles apart, glaciers have left the marks of their former low descent; and in Sikkim, Dr. Hooker saw maize growing on ancient and gigantic moraines. Southward of the Asiatic continent, {{on the opposite side of}} the equator, we know, from the excellent researches of Dr. J. Haast and Dr. Hector, that in New Zealand immense glaciers formerly descended to a low level; and the same plants, found by Dr. Hooker on widely separated mountains in this island tell the same story of a former cold period. From facts communicated to me by the Rev. W.B. Clarke, it appears also that there are traces of former glacial action on the mountains of the south-eastern corner of Australia.|$|R
40|$|A bit of {{background}} information is helpful {{in setting the}} stage for the story of these die proofs. The events up through 1919 have been documented previously and are summarized here. 1, 2, 3, 4 The demand for postage stamps in Sweden had doubled between 1910 and 1917. Jacob Bagge’s Banknote Printing Works held the stamp printing contract with the Swedish post office during this period. The increased demand, plus the fact they were unable to replace their aging presses due to World War I, resulted in Bagge’s being unable to handle the printing effectively. As a result, they canceled their contract with the Swedish post office effective at the end of 1917. The post office decided they would take over the printing task themselves, and was able to secure an extension of the contract with Bagge’s until the end of 1919. This would give them time to purchase a printing press and make the other necessary arrangements. Julius Juhlin, head of the Swedish Postal Administration, had heard of a new type of press being used by the United States Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) to print some U. S. stamps. Early in 1919 he traveled to the U. S. to investigate this press which had been designed by Benjamin R. Stickney, an employee of the BEP. Known as the Stickney press, this rotary press printed from plates {{in the form of a}} rotating cylinder onto paper <b>fed</b> from <b>rolls,</b> an innovation in stamp printing. Impressed by the speed of this press, Juhlin signed a contract on March 13, 1919, for the purchase of one machine at a cost of $ 56, 809. Since the Swedish post office did not have experience with the type of printing plates required by the Stickney press, Mr. Stickney recommended that they contract with the British American Bank Note Company (BABN) in Ottawa, Canada, which had a half-century experience in this field, to engrave the necessary dies and produce the initial set of plates. The need for all new plates presented the opportunity to redesign and replace the King Gustaf V in Medallion series of definitive (regular issue) stamps, which had been in use since 1910. Four designs, consisting of 10 denominations, were chosen: Small Coat of Arms, 1 and 3 öre; Standing Lion, 5, 25 and 3...|$|R
40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} elucidate the effects of ruminal acidosis on rumen and pancreatic tissue function, and to determine if feeding wet corn gluten feed would alleviate acidosis. An additional experiment was conducted to determine if glucose absorption was a limiting factor of starch digestion in the small intestine in ruminants. ^ In Experiment 1, increasing severity of ruminal acidosis resulted in a decrease in ruminal pH, {{and an increase in}} ruminal concentrations of D($-$) and L(+) lactate. Concentration of total organic acids in the rumen increased with increasing severity of acidosis. Blood pH decreased and plasma concentration of D($-$) lactate increased with increasing severity of ruminal acidosis. However, plasma concentrations of L(+) lactate were unchanged. Plasma activities of amylase and lipase were not influenced by increasing severity of acidosis indicating pancreatic tissue damage did not occur. Fractional rates of acetate, propionate and butyrate absorption and liquid passage rate were numerically lower in acutely acidotic lambs versus control lambs for up to 6 months following the acidosis insult. ^ Steers fed wet corn gluten feed had lower dry matter intake variation than steers <b>fed</b> dry <b>rolled</b> corn during days 19 to 24. Over a 132 -day feeding period, steers fed 86. 5 or 94. 5 % wet corn gluten feed had lower intakes and daily gains than steers fed dry-rolled corn or 35 % wet corn gluten feed, although feed efficiency was not different among treatments. In a metabolism experiment, area below ruminal pH 6. 0 was greater over a 24 -h period for steers dosed with 100 % dry-rolled corn compared with steers dosed with 50 % dry-rolled corn: 50 % wet corn gluten feed, or 100 % wet corn gluten feed. In addition, more ruminal VFA accumulated over 24 h for steers dosed with 100 % dry-rolled corn. ^ In steers with chronic indwelling catheters, glucose concentration in ileal fluid was greater when glucose was infused into the midjejunum and increased as glucose infusion in both duodenum and midjejunum increased from 0 to 18 g/h. Portal minus arterial concentration difference and net portal flux of glucose were greater when glucose was infused duodenally. When increasing concentrations of glucose were infused duodenally, net portal glucose absorption accounted for 100 % of small intestinal glucose disappearance. However, when increasing glucose was infused into the midjejunum, decreasing net portal utilization of glucose was observed and no net portal absorption occurred. ...|$|R

In Trial 1 steers (n = 20; 688 lb BW) were <b>fed</b> diets containing <b>rolled</b> full-fat soybeans (SOY) or tallow (TALLOW). In Trial 2, steers (n= 18; 780 lb BW) were fed diets containing TALLOW, flaxseed (FLAX), or a micro-algae (ALGAE) top-dressed to the TALLOW diet. Both FLAX and ALGAE were sources of omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. In both trials, diets were fed for a 14 -day acclimation period prior to intravenous injection of a bacterial lipopolysaccharide(LPS) endotoxin. Injection of LPS in Trial 1 resulted in higher rectal temperatures for animals fed TALLOW {{compared to those}} fed SOY. In contrast, plasma concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) were higher for animals fed SOY. Haptoglobin and fibrinogen increased and total {{white blood cell count}} decreased in response to LPS, but these measures were not different (P> 0. 1) between SOY and TALLOW. In Trial 2, rectal temperature was higher for TALLOW (P< 0. 05) than for FLAX at 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours after the initial injection of LPS.

50|$|In {{the most}} common method of high-volume, {{continuous}} thermoforming of thin-gauge products, plastic sheet is <b>fed</b> from a <b>roll</b> or from an extruder into a set of indexing chains that incorporate pins, or spikes, that pierce the sheet and transport it through an oven for heating to forming temperature. The heated sheet then indexes into a form station where a mating mold and pressure-box close on the sheet, with vacuum then applied to remove trapped air and to pull the material into or onto the mold along with pressurized air to form the plastic to the detailed shape of the mold. (Plug-assists are typically used in addition to vacuum {{in the case of}} taller, deeper-draw formed parts in order to provide the needed material distribution and thicknesses in the finished parts.) After a short form cycle, a burst of reverse air pressure is actuated from the vacuum side of the mold as the form tooling opens, commonly referred to as air-eject, to break the vacuum and assist the formed parts off of, or out of, the mold. A stripper plate may also be utilized on the mold as it opens for ejection of more detailed parts or those with negative-draft, undercut areas. The sheet containing the formed parts then indexes into a trim station on the same machine, where a die cuts the parts from the remaining sheet web, or indexes into a separate trim press where the formed parts are trimmed. The sheet web remaining after the formed parts are trimmed is typically wound onto a take-up reel or fed into an inline granulator for recycling.|$|R
40|$|Although Twin Roll Casting (TRC) {{process has}} been used for almost 60 years in the {{aluminum}} industry, TRC of magnesium is relatively new. In TRC, molten metal is <b>fed</b> onto water-cooled <b>rolls,</b> where it solidifies and is then rolled. Solidification of the molten metal starts at the point of first metal-roll contact and is completed before the kissing point (point of least roll separation) of the two rolls. The unique thermo-physical properties inherent to magnesium and its alloys, such as lower specific heat and latent heat of fusion and larger freezing ranges (in comparison with aluminum and steel) make it challenging for TRC of this alloy. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the process and the interaction between the casting conditions and strip final quality is imperative to guarantee high quality twin roll cast strip production. A powerful tool to achieve such knowledge is to develop a mathematical model of the process. In this thesis, a 2 D mathematical model for TRC of AZ 31 magnesium alloy has been developed and validated based on the TRC facility located at the Natural Resources Canada Government Materials Laboratory (CanmetMATERIALS) in Hamilton, ON, Canada. The validation was performed by comparing the predicted exit strip temperature and secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) through the strip thickness with those measured and obtained by experiments. The model was developed in two stages, first a thermal-fluid model was developed followed by validation and then a thermal-fluid-stress model was developed. This is the first time a comprehensive thermal-fluid-stress model has been developed to simulate the TRC process for magnesium alloys. The work has led to new knowledge about the TRC process and its effects on magnesium strip quality including the following: 1) 	Using ALSIM and ANSYS® CFX® commercial packages a 2 D mathematical model of thermal-fluid-stress behavior of the magnesium sheet during TRC was successfully developed and validated. 2) 	An average value of 11 kW/m 2 °C for the Heat Transfer Coefficient (HTC) was found to best represent the heat transfer between the roll and the strip during TRC casting of AZ 31 using the CanmetMATERIALS facility. 3) 	Modeling results showed that increasing casting speed, casting thicker strips and applying higher HTCs led to less uniform microstructure through thickness in terms of SDAS. 4) 	Simulations showed the importance of casting parameters such as casting speed and set-back distance on the thermal history and stress development in the sheet during TRC; higher casting speeds led to deeper sumps and higher exit temperatures as well as lower overall rolling loads and lower total strains experienced during TRC. 5) 	The effect of roll diameter on the thermal history and stress development in the strip was also studied and indicated how larger roll diameters increased the surface normal stress and rolling loads but had little effect on the mushy zone thickness. 6) 	The correlation between the mechanisms of center-line and inverse segregation formation and thermo-mechanical behavior of the strip was performed. The modeling results suggested that increasing the set-back distance decreases the risk of both defects. Moreover, increasing the roll diameter reduces the propensity to inverse segregation but has a minor effect for center-line segregation formation...|$|R
