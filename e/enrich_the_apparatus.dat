40|$|Abstract We derive a {{probabilistic}} {{account of}} the vagueness and context-sensitivity of scalar adjectives from a Bayesian approach to communication and interpretation. We describe an iterated-reasoning architecture for pragmatic interpretation and illustrate it with a simple scalar implicature example. We then show how to <b>enrich</b> <b>the</b> <b>apparatus</b> to handle pragmatic reasoning about the values of free variables, explore its predictions about the interpretation of scalar adjectives, and show how this model implements Edgington’s (1992; 1997) {{account of the}} sorites paradox, with variations. The Bayesian approach {{has a number of}} explanatory virtues: in particular, it does not require any special-purpose machinery for handling vagueness, and it is integrated with a promising new approach to pragmatics and other areas of cognitive science. Edgington (1992, 1997) proposes an attractive unified approach to the Sorites, Lottery, and Preface paradoxes. According to Edgington, these puzzles are all explained by a generalization of classical logic which has the formal structure of the probability calculus, with an accompanying generalized notion of valid reasoning. She gives a number of strong arguments to the effect that a degree-based theory of vagueness with the formal structure of probabilities is preferable to one with the structure of classical fuzzy logic. However, she explicitly disavows the idea that the degree...|$|E

For example, the envelope proteins of viruses such as HIV, influenza, dengue fever and several filoviruses including ebola and marburg virus must be cleaved by furin or furin-like proteases to become fully functional. Anthrax toxin, pseudomonas exotoxin, and papillomaviruses must be processed by furin during their initial entry into host cells. Inhibitors of furin are under consideration as therapeutic agents for treating anthrax infection.|$|R

40|$|Among {{the most}} provocative propositions inaugurated by Bachelard’s work one cannot miss his {{reflection}} {{on the question of}} imagination as “a major force of human nature” (The Poetics of Space), anticipating thus the premise that the productivity of imagination does not reside—as was usually thought—in its capacity for creating images derived from reality but in “the faculty of forming images which would surpass reality” (Water and Dreams). In pursuing these ideas, Bachelard—apart from <b>enriching</b> <b>the</b> hermeneutical <b>apparatus</b> around <b>the</b> elucidation of literary works—was able to take his writing {{at the center of the}} becoming of the imagination as well as into the transcendental phenomena of the poetic vision. His understanding of the experience of imagination as a becoming would make possible the internalization of the flow of the imagining as an organic entity which could not possibly be ascribed to pragmatic fields of representation nor to chronological or linear dimensions. My essay reflects on the above referred principles which are essential to Bachelard’s construction of his poetics of imagination. Additionally, I contextualize these ideas with an analyses of the imaginative processes found in Pedro Prado’s work Alsino, a poetic novel that can be situated in the antipodes of rationality since its drive for the construct of the ascensional pertain to both the realm of the oneiric, and the plane of an enduring psychical energy. </p...|$|R
40|$|The article {{outlines}} the key {{stages in the}} development of modern theory of migration following the historical sequence and continuity of its basic conceptual constructs’ formation. Although the author refers to the twentieth century as a chronological framework of the text, the narrative begins from the works of E. Ravenstein published {{at the end of the}} XIX century, for they laid the foundation for future theoretical studies on migration issues. In particular, many well-known scientists still use concepts “laws of migration” and “attracting and push factors of migration” proposed by Ravenstein claiming their timeless validity or, on the contrary, criticizing them for the loss of relevance in the new social and cultural realities. The author considers as milestones of the modern theory of migration the works of the representatives of Chicago school of sociology that <b>enriched</b> <b>the</b> conceptual <b>apparatus</b> of <b>the</b> analysis of migration processes and the typology of driving causes of migration; the works of S. Stouffer, G. Zipf, E. Lee and W. Lewis, W. Zelinsky and D. Massey. Finally, the article summarizes the objective trends in today’s global development that force scientists to introduce new accents in the study of migration processes, although upon closer inspection it turns out that all “new” ideas had already been formulated in early migration studies and just got a new sound in another historical period...|$|R
40|$|As the {{popularity}} of ‘law and economics’ is rapidly increasing, this essay is an invitation to pause and reflect on its methodology. Mainstream law and economics is generally associated with a paradigm that embraces rational choice theory as the theoretical grid that best understands human behaviour and efficiency as the primary goal to be achieved by legal rules. This essay contends that the mainstream paradigm is inadequate because it cannot deal {{with a series of}} issues relevant for the understanding of legal-economic questions. The limits of rational choice theory employed as an exclusionary mode of analysis and of efficiency, considered to be the ultimate and only goal for policymakers, are thereby identified. Notably, the critiques formulated do not imply a rejection of rational choice theory altogether; rather, it is suggested that other theories may well <b>enrich</b> <b>the</b> analytical <b>apparatus</b> of L&E. It is further argued that an approach labelled ‘eclecticism’ is most desirable where eclecticism is understood to mean a paradigm open to different methodologies, doctrines, and styles. Before concluding that eclecticism is a better approach, the criticisms that such an approach may attract are considered. Drawing on {{the meaning of the word}} ‘eclectic’, it is concluded that this approach is suitable for an economic analysis of law. Finally, it is shown that law and economics scholars to a certain extent already practise eclecticism; hence, the real issue may be more a question of acknowledging its endorsement rather than advocating for it...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} the subcellular distribution and functions of LIMK 1 in developing neurons. Confocal microscopy, subcellular fractionation, and expression of several epitope-tagged LIMK 1 constructs revealed that LIMK 1 is <b>enriched</b> in <b>the</b> Golgi <b>apparatus</b> and growth cones, with the LIM domain required for Golgi localization and the PDZ domain for its presence at neuritic tips. Overexpression of wild-type LIMK 1 suppresses the formation of trans-Golgi derived tubules, and prevents cytochalasin D-induced Golgi fragmentation, whereas that of a kinase-defective mutant has the opposite effect. Transfection of wild-type LIMK 1 accelerates axon formation and enhances the accumulation of Par 3 /Par 6, insulin-like growth factor (IGF) 1 receptors, and neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) at growth cones, while inhibiting the Golgi export of synaptophysin-containing vesicles. These effects were dependent on the Golgi localization of LIMK 1, paralleled {{by an increase in}} cofilin phosphorylation and phalloidin staining in the region of <b>the</b> Golgi <b>apparatus,</b> and prevented by coexpression of constitutive active cofilin. The long-term overexpression of LIMK 1 produces growth cone collapse and axon retraction, an effect that is dependent on its growth cone localization. Together, our results suggest an important role for LIMK 1 in axon formation that is related with its ability to regulate Golgi dynamics, membrane traffic, and actin cytoskeletal organization...|$|R

5000|$|That {{mutations}} are unpredictable, faithfully replicated, {{and that}} natural selection operates only upon {{the products of}} chance is repeated {{at the start of}} chapter seven entitled [...] "Evolution". Monod states that the decisive factor in natural selection is not the [...] "struggle for life" [...] but is the differential rate of reproduction and the only mutations [...] "acceptable" [...] to an organism are those that [...] "do not lessen the coherence of <b>the</b> teleonomic <b>apparatus,</b> but rather, further strengthen it in its already assumed orientation" [...] (Monod, 119). Monod explains that the teleonomic performance is judged through natural selection and this system retains only a very small fraction of mutations that will perfect and <b>enrich</b> <b>the</b> teleonomic <b>apparatus.</b> Monod gives <b>the</b> example of antibody development to show how chance combinations can give a well defined solution. He states that the source of information for the antibodies associative structure is not the antigen itself but is instead the result of many random recombinations of part of the antibody gene. The antibody that is able to bind to the antigen is multiplied. This remarkable example shows chance as the basis {{for one of the most}} precise adaptation phenomena. Monod makes the point that selection of a mutation is due to the environmental surroundings of the organism and the teleonomic performances. He then gives some examples to show the interconnection of specific performances/behaviors and anatomical adaptations. The author spends the rest of the chapter discussing linguistic and physical human evolutionary development. Language is an utterly different from the various auditory, tactile, and visual forms of communication in that it allows the communication of an original personal association to another individual. Monod hypothesizes that language was not merely the product but one of the driving forces for the evolution of our central nervous system. He believes that rudimentary symbolic communication appeared early on and created a new selective pressure that favored development of linguistic ability and hence the brain. He then talks about the evolution of our ancestors including the development of upright posture which allowed them to become hunters. Monod lastly points out the evidence to suggest the development of the cognitive function of language in children depends upon postnatal growth of the cortex.|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Endothelial von Willebrand factor (VWF) mediates {{platelet}} adhesion and {{acts as a}} protective chaperone to clotting factor VIII. Rapid release of highly multimerized VWF is particularly effective in promoting hemostasis. To produce this protein, an elaborate biogenesis is required, culminating at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) in storage within secretory granules called Weibel-Palade bodies (WPB). Failure to correctly form these organelles can lead to uncontrolled secretion of low-molecular-weight multimers of VWF. The TGN-associated adaptor AP- 1 and its interactors clathrin, aftiphilin and γ-synergin are essential to initial WPB formation at <b>the</b> Golgi <b>apparatus,</b> and thus to VWF storage and secretion. OBJECTIVES: To identify new proteins implicated in VWF storage and/or secretion. METHODS: A genomewide RNA interference (RNAi) screen was performed in the Nematode C. elegans to identify new AP- 1 genetic interactors. RESULTS: The small GTPase Rab 10 was found to genetically interact with a partial loss of function of AP- 1 in C. elegans. We investigated Rab 10 in human primary umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We report that Rab 10 is <b>enriched</b> at <b>the</b> Golgi <b>apparatus,</b> where WPB are formed, and that in cells where Rab 10 expression has been suppressed by siRNA, VWF secretion is altered: the amount of rapidly released VWF was significantly reduced. We also found that Rab 8 A has a similar function. CONCLUSION: Rab 10 and Rab 8 A are new cytoplasmic factors implicated in WPB biogenesis that {{play a role in}} generating granules that can rapidly respond to secretagogue...|$|R

40|$|Enveloped viruses of eukaryotes obtain their {{membrane}} by budding {{through a}} cellular membrane. Therefore, most frequently the lipid {{composition of the}} virion envelope reflects that of the membrane where budding took place. In the case of herpes simplex viruses, nucleocapsids assemble in the nucleus and bud through the inner nuclear membrane. The pathway from the perinuclear space to the extracellular medium is as yet poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that the phospholipid composition of extracellular herpes simplex virions {{differs from that of}} nuclei isolated from the infected cells. The viral membrane contains threefold higher concentrations of sphingomyelin and phosphatidylserine. These lipids are typically <b>enriched</b> in <b>the</b> Golgi <b>apparatus</b> and plasma membrane. The data are in agreement with a model in which herpes simplex virus, after budding through the inner nuclear membrane, loses its envelope by fusing with the outer nuclear membrane and obtains a new membrane by budding into a compartment late in the exocytotic pathway, very likely <b>the</b> Golgi <b>apparatus</b> or membranes derived from it. Alternatively, because the perinuclear space is continuous with the ER lumen, the virus after its first budding may be transported through the exocytotic pathway without ever leaving the lumen of the subsequent compartments. In that case, either the virions, while budding through the nuclear membrane select for sphingomyelin and phosphatidylserine, or the original lipids of the viral envelope are exchanged for lipids of an exocytotic membrane, most likely by a transient membrane continuity between the virion and the vesicle by which it is surrounded. Light particles, virus-like particles that lack capsid and DNA but contain tegument and envelope proteins, displayed the same lipid composition as complete herpes simplex virions, suggesting that they also acquired their envelope from a Golgi membrane...|$|R

40|$|Poland, {{as a young}} {{conservative}} democracy, is witnessing {{an unprecedented}} amount of public debate where ‘gender’ and ‘sexuality’ figure prominently. Both, however, tend {{to be perceived as}} foreign imports and thus fiercely contested. Consequently, the role of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) materials as well as teachers as potential mediators of markedly different Anglophone socio-politics is of paramount importance. What is more, the only Polish research examining the portrayal of women in EFL materials is that by Jaworski (1986), who exposed the abundance of sexism in EFL textbooks available in Poland at that time. Regrettably, ‘sexuality’ as a culturally (but not linguistically) important identity category was not addressed or recognised in the broad Polish educational context until 2012 (Świerszcz 2012). This chapter reports on two studies conducted as part of the research project entitled “Investigating Gender and Sexuality in the ESL classroom: Raising publishers', teachers' and students' awareness”. The aim of the first study was to qualitatively scrutinize the discursive and multimodal construction of gender, gender relations, and sexuality in two leading illustrated Primary School EFL textbooks in Poland, along with the accompanying workbooks and teacher’s books. To this end the analytical methods of Feminist Critical Discourse Analysis (Fairclough 1989; Lazar 2005, 2014), Multimodal Discourse Analysis (see e. g. Giaschi 2000; Guo 2004; O’Halloran 2004; Kress and Van Leeuwen 2006) and the concept of critical heteronormativity (Motschenbacher 2010, 2011) were utilized. The analyses focused on the representation of the social roles of men and women, boys and girls in EFL materials. They also demonstrated different textual manifestations of heteronormativity. ‘Gender critical points’ (Sunderland et al. 2002) – identified in the first study - were drawn on in the second study. We also extended Sunderland et al. ’s (2002) concept by introducing the notion of ‘gender-emerging points’, which we believe <b>enriches</b> <b>the</b> analytical <b>apparatus</b> by highlighting <b>the</b> dynamic character of classroom interactions and thus the central role of teachers. Here we used audio-recorded primary school classroom interactions to demonstrate how the identified ‘gender critical points’ are addressed and how ‘gender-emerging points’ surface and/or are made (ir-) relevant in the classroom setting. Thus the analysis focused on gendered ‘talk around the text’ emerging in teacher-student interactions to explore negotiation, challenge and/or rejection and ‘uptake’ of gender roles and discourse. To this end methods and insights from critical linguistic analysis were used along with Sunderland’s (this volume) agenda for future research on gender representation in foreign language textbooks...|$|R
