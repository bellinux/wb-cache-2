5|$|As the War of the Fourth Coalition {{broke out}} in September 1806, Emperor Napoleon <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> Grande Armée {{into the heart of}} Germany in a memorable {{campaign}} against Prussia. Comprising the same regiments as the year before (1st and 2nd Carabiniers-à-Cheval, 2nd, 3rd, 9th and 12th cuirassiers), Nansouty's 1st heavy cavalry division was again a part of Joachim Murat's cavalry reserve. At first, due to the extraordinary speed of Napoleon's operations, the 1st heavy cavalry division and one of the two cuirassier brigades of d'Hautpoul's 2nd heavy cavalry division did not arrive at the front line in time to participate in the Battle of Jena. Beginning with the evening of 14 October, Nansouty's cavalry pursued the routed Prussian army, following an enemy corps of 10,000 infantrymen and 3 cavalry regiments into the streets of Erfurt on 15 October. With the enemy trapped in the city, Colonel Préval of the 3rd cuirassiers negotiated the capitulation of Erfurt by nightfall, which resulted in the capture of 12,000 prisoners of war (including 6,000 wounded) and 65 cannons.|$|E

2500|$|Despite strong resistance, the Ottomans {{seized a}} number of {{important}} towns and fortresses in 1388, and five years later they captured Tarnovo after a three-month siege. Ivan Shishman died in 1395 when the Ottomans, led by Bayezid <b>I,</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> last fortress Nikopol. In 1396, Ivan Sratsimir joined the Crusade of the Hungarian king Sigismund, but after the Christian army was defeated in the battle of Nicopolis the Ottomans immediately marched on Vidin and seized it, bringing an end to the medieval Bulgarian state. Resistance continued under Constantine and Fruzhin until 1422. The former was referred to by king Sigismund as the [...] "distinguished Constantine, glorious Emperor of Bulgaria".|$|E

60|$|I {{could see}} he was not at ease, so <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> poor old {{wrinkled}} hand in mine and asked him to speak fully.|$|E
