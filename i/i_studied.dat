Religion, however, played an increasingly insignificant role in his life. He would later remark that his continued studies in theology drew him closer to atheism: [...] "I had a very clear feeling that I didn't believe in God and that I had in fact received a certificate in materialist uncertainty; the more <b>I</b> <b>studied</b> religious subjects, the less I believed in God."

Not only a mother figure to him, she was often observed in rehearsal as an accomplished performer. He said: [...] "I got to know her well. She taught me so much.

In an interview to TOI, the actress said: [...] "We feel sympathetic towards them, but we never employ them. We are scared because we have not grown up with them. While these people might be visually impaired, their other senses are very strong. So they can effectively give foot and back massages and treatments like reflexology. It's important to understand that you are not doing a favour on them but they are doing a favour on you".|$|E

If he can hear that, I'm okay. If he can't hear it, I'm not an authentic jazz voice", she added. Inspiration for singing came from jazz singer Amy Winehouse, who died in July 2011; Gaga added [...] "I thought of her almost {{every day in the}} studio. I wish she was still here.

The songs were recorded live with the band, and during the recording process Gaga asked for carpets to be placed on the studio floor, so that it looked like a film set and it could be photographed.|$|E

500|$|The novel Miracle at St. Anna {{was written}} by James McBride [...] {{originating}} from his late uncle's experiences as a World War II soldier. [...] Upon writing the novel, McBride conducted his own research and learned of the 92nd Infantry Division, which consisted of 15,000 African-American soldiers, who served in Italy during World War II from August 1944 to November 1945. McBride interviewed several remaining members of the 92nd Division. [...] "I studied Italian at The New School in New York City," [...] he explained. [...] "I moved to Italy with my family for six months. I interviewed dozens of Italians—Partisans and Fascists. I interviewed dozens of African-American soldiers who fought in the war, most who have since passed away. I must have read at least 20 books. I went to the Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. <b>I</b> <b>studied</b> the whole business of what the 92nd did in Italy during the war, {{to try to get}} an idea of what really transpired."

500|$|One of Bridget's first {{high-profile}} storylines was {{coping with}} a disability, after Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) hit Bridget with her car. She had been paralysed {{on one side of}} her body, the storyline saw her trying to regain the complete use of her body. Mignon explained during an interview with media reporting website Last Broadcast, the research that had been carried out and the effects on the character stating: [...] "Bridget suffers extreme physical difficulties as a result, because she's such a sporty tomboy, to be incapacitated suddenly poses emotional problems for her. To make sure that I could understand better what Bridget's going through, <b>I</b> <b>studied</b> medical notes on paralysis and disability on the internet." [...] The storyline also explored self-image issues that come with disabilities, in one episode Bridget was doing physiotherapy exercises and became in danger of drowning until Declan Napier (James Sorensen) saved her. He tried to kiss her but she fended off his advances, of this Mignon said: [...] "Bridget pushes him off, she fears he'll see her differently due to her disability." ...|$|E

500|$|Another {{explanation}} is that the attacks were an angry response by Bajrang Dal over the allegations that the New Life Fellowship Trust were indulging in forceful religious conversion of Hindus and distribution of vulgar literature slandering Hindu gods and goddesses. Bajrang Dal claimed that nearly 15,000 people had been forced to adopt Christianity as their religion in Mangalore alone in the past year after monitoring the situation. In the book Satyadarshini, written by Andhra Pradesh Pastor Paravastu Suryanarayana Rao, it was also reported that the New Life Fellowship Trust had denigrated and defamed Hindu gods, causing anger amongst the Bajrang Dal. Hindu activists also alleged that excerpts from Rao's book had been published in pamphlets to spread its influence. Mahila Parishat leader Asha Jagadish believed that the attacks were solely motivated by religious conversion by New Life and claimed that her neighbour was forcefully converted into Christianity to marry a Christian girl, further stating, [...] "The Holy Saint School in Bangalore, where <b>I</b> <b>studied</b> up to fifth standard, did not allow me to wear kumkum or bangles according to Hindu tradition." [...] Fr. Francis Serrao, rector of St. Aloysius College, stated that he believed the attacks were not due to conversion, but was rather a reflection of the struggle between Christianity and Brahmanism and theorised that Christian ideology and Brahmin ideology can never coexist as [...] "Christianity propagates love and Brahmanism propagates hate." ...|$|E
