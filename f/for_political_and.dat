5|$|A {{changing}} legal imperative (transatlantic {{slave trade}} outlawed by Britain in 1807) and economic imperative (a desire <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> social stability) led most European powers to support widespread cultivation of agricultural products, {{such as the}} palm, for use in European industry.|$|E
5|$|The Nazis also {{targeted}} {{religious groups}} <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> ideological reasons. Thousands of Christian clergy were killed, including some with a Jewish background (Edith Stein, for example). The Nazis considered Jews a racial group; secular people {{and those of}} other religions who had Jewish ancestry were, therefore, Jews (a belief shared by some Jews).|$|E
5|$|Although up to 200,000 {{people were}} {{executed}} during the Spanish Civil War and its immediate aftermath, 48 people were executed {{in the period}} from 1948 {{to the time of}} the 1975 executions. Of those, 17 were executed by firing squad and 31 by garrotting. Historically, the garrote had been the preferred execution method in Spain, with firing squads used <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> military prisoners.|$|E

However, later that year Edward {{revealed}} his desire to marry divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson. British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin advised Edward that <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> religious reasons he could not marry a divorced woman and remain king. Edward abdicated to marry Simpson, and George ascended the throne as the third monarch of the House of Windsor.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert was knighted on 15 July 1907 in {{recognition}} of his contributions to drama. Sullivan had been knighted for his contributions to music {{almost a quarter of}} a century earlier, in 1883. Gilbert was, however, the first British writer ever to receive a knighthood for his plays alone—earlier dramatist knights, such as Sir William Davenant and Sir John Vanbrugh, were knighted <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> other services.|$|E
5|$|While East Timor's {{decision}} {{to form a}} military has been criticised by some commentators, the East Timorese government has consistently believed that the force is necessary <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> security reasons. Critics of the F-FDTL's establishment argue that as East Timor does not face any external threats the government's limited resources would be better spent on strengthening the PNTL. While East Timor's political leadership recognises that the country does not currently face an external threat, they {{believe that it is}} necessary to maintain a military capacity to deter future aggression. The establishment of the F-FDTL was also seen as an effective means of integrating FALINTIL into an independent East Timor.|$|E

5|$|Zakuani {{was born}} in Kinshasa, Zaire—now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. When he was four, his father, Mao Zakuani, moved his family to London <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> {{professional}} reasons after receiving a job offer as a translator. The family switched homes often and lived with extended family for long periods. They later settled in a north London neighborhood with other African families, where Zakuani attended White Hart Lane School.|$|E
5|$|At {{about the}} same time that Villa and Orozco were marching on Ciudad Juárez, the Zapatista revolt {{gathered}} strength and spread to the states of Puebla, Tlaxcala, Mexico, Michoacán and Guerrero. On April 14, Madero had Emiliano Zapata officially designated as his representative in the region. However, Zapata was worried that if he did not fully control all the major towns in Morelos by the time that Madero concluded negotiations with Díaz, the demands of his agrarian movement and the issue of the autonomy of Morelos would be ignored or sidelined. Zapata's first military action was to take the town of Chinameca where he obtained essential supplies. Subsequently, Zapata, <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> strategic reasons, decided to attack the city of Cuautla. In order to mislead his opponents however, he initially attacked and captured the towns of Izúcar de Matamoros (which was subsequently retaken by federal forces) and Chietla. From there he made a wide circle around Cuautla and captured Yautepec and Jonacatepec where he gathered more supplies, munitions and soldiers. By May, out of all the major urban centers in the region, only Cuautla and the capital of Morelos, Cuernavaca, remained outside of his control.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the commons}} and King Richard II were {{enthusiastic}} about the launch of a crusade to Flanders, <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> economic reasons: revenues from the English wool staple (that had ceased following the advance of the French) could be resumed; sending the bishop and not the king or his uncles to Flanders would enable John of Gaunt's unpopular plans for a royal crusade to Castille to be abandoned; French forces would be drawn away from the Iberian peninsula; and Anglo-Flemish relations would be strengthened. Another advantage in approving a crusade was that its cost would be borne by the Church and not by means of government levies: ever since the Peasants' Revolt, the government was fearful {{of the consequences of}} imposing a tax to pay for a new war against the French.|$|E

5|$|From 1878 to 1890, the Anti-Socialist Laws forbade all socialist trade unions. Only small local organizations, which communicated via {{intermediaries}} such as stewards, {{who worked}} illegally or semi-legally, survived. This form of organization {{was easier to}} protect against state repression. After the laws were sunset in 1890, the General Commission of the Trade Unions of Germany was founded on November 17 {{at a conference in}} Berlin to centralize the socialist labor movement. In 1892, the Trade Union Congress of Halberstadt was held to organize the many local unions under the committee. The localists, 31,000 of whom were represented at the congress, wanted to retain many of the changes that had been adopted during the repressive period. For example, they opposed separate organizations <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> economic matters, such as the party and the trade union. They especially wanted to keep their grassroots democratic structures. They also advocated local trade unions being networked by delegates rather than ruled centrally, and were wary of bureaucratic structures. The localists' proposals were rejected at the Halberstadt congress, so they refused to join the centralized trade unions, which became known as the Free Trade Unions. They did not renounce social democracy, but rather considered themselves to be an avant-garde within the social democratic movement in Germany.|$|E
5|$|In a {{statement}} on Egyptian state television, Suleiman announced the formation of two independent committees <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> constitutional reforms, both starting work immediately. One committee would carry out constitutional and legislative amendments to enable a shift of power. The other would monitor the implementation of all proposed reforms. Suleiman also stressed that demonstrators would not be prosecuted and that a separate independent fact-finding committee would be established to probe the violence of 2February. He said that wider press freedoms were under consideration {{and that he would}} produce a list of what was needed to hold free elections. He also said that plans were underway to organize a peaceful transfer of power. Suleiman reiterated his view that Egypt was not ready for democracy, while warning of a possible coup d'état unless demonstrators agreed to enter negotiations.|$|E
5|$|On {{the grand}} {{strategic}} level Marlborough had a rare {{grasp of the}} broad issues involved, and was able {{from the start of}} the Spanish Succession war to see the conflict in its entirety. He was one of the few influences working towards genuine unity within the Grand Alliance, but the extension of the war aims to include the replacement of PhilipV as King of Spain was a fatal mistake. Marlborough stands accused – possibly <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> diplomatic reasons – of not pressing his private doubts about reinforcing failure. Spain proved a continuous drain of men and resources, and ultimately hampered his chances of complete success in Flanders, the war's main theatre. The Allies did come close to a complete victory on several occasions, but the increasingly severe conditions imposed upon LouisXIV forestalled an early end to hostilities. Although the Duke lost his political influence in the latter stages of the war he still possessed vast prestige abroad, yet his failure to communicate his innermost convictions to his allies or political masters means he must bear some responsibility for the continuance of the war beyond its logical conclusion.|$|E
