50|$|Teriparatide is {{a portion}} of human {{parathyroid}} hormone (PTH), amino acid sequence 1 through 34, of the complete molecule (containing 84 amino acids). Endogenous PTH is the primary regulator of calcium and phosphate metabolism in bone and kidney. PTH increases serum calcium, partially accomplishing this by increasing bone resorption. Thus, chronically elevated PTH will deplete bone stores. However, <b>intermittent</b> <b>exposure</b> to PTH will activate osteoblasts more than osteoclasts. Thus, once-daily injections of teriparatide have a net effect of stimulating new bone formation leading to increased bone mineral density.|$|E
50|$|Photosynthesis {{converts}} {{light energy}} into chemical {{energy in the}} form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This occurs in the chloroplasts of plants cells. Light photons interact with various intermebrane proteins of the cholorplast to accomplish this. However, these proteins can become saturated with photons, making them unable to function until the saturation is alleviated. This is known as the Kautsky effect and is a cause of inefficiency on the ATP production mechanism. Cytoplasmic streaming in Chara corallina, however, enables chloroplasts to move around the stem of the plant. Thus, the chloroplasts move into lighted regions and shaded regions. This <b>intermittent</b> <b>exposure</b> to photons due to cytoplasmic streaming actually increases the photosynthetic efficiency of chloroplasts. Photosynthetic activity is generally assessed using chlorophyll fluorescence analysis.|$|E
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{revision of}} the literature was conducted in order to undertake a comprehensive meta-analysis of all published observational studies on melanoma. An extensive analysis of the inconsistencies and variability in the estimates was performed to provide some clues about its Epidemiology. Following a systematic literature search, relative risks (RRs) for sun exposure were extracted from 57 studies published before September 2002. <b>Intermittent</b> sun <b>exposure</b> and sunburn history were shown to play considerable roles as risk factors for melanoma, whereas a high occupational sun exposure seemed to be inversely associated to melanoma. The country of study and adjustment of the estimates adjuste for phenotype and photo-type {{were significantly associated with}} the variability of the <b>intermittent</b> sun <b>exposure</b> estimates (P = 0. 024, 0. 003 and 0. 030, respectively). For chronic sun exposure, inclusion of controls with dermatological diseases and latitude resulted in significantly different data (P = 0. 05 and 0. 031, respectively). Latitude was also shown to be important (P = 0. 031) for a history of sunburn; studies conducted at higher latitudes presented higher risks for a history of sunburns. Role of country, inclusion of controls with dermatological diseases and other study features seemed to suggest that "well conducted" studies supported the <b>intermittent</b> sun <b>exposure</b> hypothesis: a positive association for <b>intermittent</b> sun <b>exposure</b> and an inverse association with a high continuous pattern of sun exposure.

40|$|Brown {{adipose tissue}} (BAT) {{is the most}} {{essential}} thermogenic organ in homeotherms. In mice, brown adipocytes like cells (beige adipocytes) appear in subcutaneous fat depot after prolonged cold exposure. Fully-functioning BAT and beige adipocytes in subcutaneous fat depot drive {{a sharp increase in}} energy expenditure. In fact, cold-elicited BAT activation and beige cell recruitment in subcutaneous adipose tissue have shown anti -obesity effect, making them a promising target for obesity treatment. Due to the practice reasons, <b>intermittent</b> cold <b>exposure</b> may be an effective approach to activate BAT and to treat obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, cold exposure is known to induce various physiological changes and therefore warrants a comprehensive study looking at the effects of cold exposure on the whole body energy homeostasis. We found that <b>intermittent</b> cold <b>exposure</b> (ICE) leads to mild adaptive hyperphagia and fat accumulation in mice. Fat accumulation was mostly observed in subcutaneous adipose tissue with increased lipogenesis genes expression. ICE also increased fat accumulation in liver.

Here, we ex-pand on these findings to test whether ethosuximide can reduce the sensitivity to pentylenetetra-zole-induced seizures during ethanol withdrawal. Methods: We used an <b>intermittent</b> ethanol <b>exposure</b> model to produce withdrawal-induced hyper-excitability in DBA/ 2 J mice. Results: Ethosuximide (250 mg/kg) reduced seizure severity in mice undergoing ethanol withdrawal with concurrent PTZ treatment (20 mg/kg). Importantly, ethosuximide did not produce rebound ex-citability and protected against ethanol withdrawal-induced mortality produced by concurrent PTZ treatment (40 mg/kg).

40|$|Healthy male rats were acclimatized {{by being}} placed in a {{decompression}} chamber at a simulated altitude of 18 000 feet (5486 m) for three hours daily for 84 days.

40|$|A {{history of}} <b>intermittent</b> <b>exposures</b> to drugs of abuse can cause {{long-term}} changes in acute behavioural {{responses to a}} subsequent drug exposure. In drug-naive rats, morphine can elicit intermittent cataleptic postures followed by sustained increases in locomotor activity. Chronic intermittent morphine treatment can reduce catalepsy and increase locomotor behaviour and stereotypy induced by morphine, even after prolonged periods of abstinence. The nucleus accumbens and limbic basal ganglia circuitry are implicated in the expression of various morphine-induced motor behaviours and catalepsy. We examined the effect of <b>intermittent</b> morphine <b>exposure</b> {{on the distribution of}} Fos proteins in the basal ganglia following a subsequent morphine challenge administered after a period of drug abstinence. We found that such exposures increased c-Fos induced by a morphine challenge in accumbens core regions that were immunoreactive for the μ-opioid receptor, and this correlated with the frequency of stereotypic behaviours displayed by the rats. We also found that a history of morphine exposures increased c-Fos in the ventrolateral striatum in response to a morphine challenge following 14 d but not 24 h of drug abstinence. In contrast, such a history induced acute Fras in the nucleus accumbens in response to a morphine challenge following 24 h but not 14 d of morphine abstinence. These data provide further confirmation that psychomotor sensitisation induced by repetitive morphine exposure involves long-term neuroadaptations in basal ganglia circuitry particularly {{at the level of the}} nucleus accumbens...|$|R
40|$|Aquatic organisms {{experience}} <b>intermittent</b> <b>exposure</b> to contaminants. The hazard {{from such}} discontinuous exposure may {{not simply be}} predicted from existing continuous exposure. Little {{is known about the}} bioaccumulation responses of shellfish to metals during intermittent compared to the continuous exposure counterparts. This study was designed to compare the bioaccumulation responses of two metals (Cd and Hg) singly (Chapters 3 and 4) or mixtures (Chapters 5 and 6) during continuous and <b>intermittent</b> <b>exposure.</b> Responses were examined using a multi-assay approach in areas of oxidative stress, osmoregulation, haematology and organ pathology. Tissue metal concentrations were highest in the gill and digestive gland for both metals. The linear or curvilinear pattern of accumulation was observed in the continuous exposure. While an alternating temporal uptake and clearance corresponding with the exposure was observed in the gill (Hg alone) and haemolymph (Cd alone) in intermittent profile. At the end, the study shows that accumulation of Hg or Cd was less in the intermittent compared to the continuous exposure for most tissue. Sub-lethal responses during Hg or Cd alone were similar in both regime apart from the severe pathology in the gill (continuous exposure) and inflammation in the digestive gland (<b>intermittent</b> <b>exposure)</b> observed in the Hg alone treatment (Chapter 4). For Hg plus Cd mixture, the additive effect in accumulation was observed in both exposures. Sub-lethal responses during mixtures were not affected in the intermittent. However, an antagonistic interaction was observed in the TBARS during continuous exposures for all tissues apart from the digestive gland. In terms of risk assessment, regulations for the single metals in continuous exposure will be protective for intermittent events at least for adult M. galloprovincialis.
