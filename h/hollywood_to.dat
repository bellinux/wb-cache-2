5|$|In October 1927, Warner Bros. {{released}} The Jazz Singer, {{the first}} feature-length talking picture. Its success prompted <b>Hollywood</b> <b>to</b> convert from silent to sound film production en masse. The Radio Corporation of America (RCA) controlled an advanced optical sound-on-film system, RCA Photophone, recently developed by General Electric. However, its hopes of {{joining in the}} anticipated boom in sound movies faced a major hurdle: Warner Bros. and Fox, Hollywood's other vanguard sound studios, were already financially and technologically aligned with ERPI, a subsidiary of AT's Western Electric division. The industry's two largest major studios, Paramount and Loew's/MGM, with two other studios Universal and First National, were poised to contract with ERPI for sound conversion as well.|$|E

5|$|The film {{suffered}} setbacks {{in development}} in December 2002. Rudin left Unfortunate Events over budget concerns. While Sonnenfeld and Carrey remained, Sonnenfeld admitted he was skeptical of Paramount's $100million budget. The studio decided that changing the shoot from <b>Hollywood</b> <b>to</b> Wilmington, North Carolina {{would be less}} expensive. The April 2003 start date was also pushed back. Paramount eventually settled the situation in January 2003 by enlisting help from DreamWorks to co-finance the film, but Sonnenfeld vacated the director's position. Rudin and Sonnenfeld had no involvement with the film afterward, but were credited as executive producers. Carrey remained with approval over the hiring of the next director.|$|E
5|$|Disney {{moved to}} Hollywood in July 1923. Although New York {{was the center}} of the cartoon industry, he was {{attracted}} to Los Angeles because his brother Roy was convalescing from tuberculosis there. Disney's efforts to sell Alice's Wonderland were in vain until he heard from New York film distributor Margaret J. Winkler. She was losing the rights to both the Out of the Inkwell and Felix the Cat cartoons, and needed a new series. In October they signed a contract for six Alice comedies, with an option for two further series of six episodes each. Disney and his brother Roy formed the Disney Brothers Studiowhich later became The Walt Disney Companyto produce the films; they persuaded Davis and her family to relocate to <b>Hollywood</b> <b>to</b> continue production, with Davis on contract at $100 a month. In July 1924 Disney also hired Iwerks, persuading him to relocate to Hollywood from Kansas City.|$|E
5|$|During their suspension, Mulder and Scully {{venture to}} <b>Hollywood</b> <b>to</b> view the {{production}} of Federman's film.

After filming is done, Mulder and Scully attend a screening of the film with Skinner, but are thoroughly disgusted at how their case, and they, are portrayed on the big screen. Mulder and Scully leave the set holding hands, presumably {{on their way to}} dinner with the FBI credit card Skinner gave them after watching the movie, hinting at the continued romantic relationship between Mulder and Scully that has been suggested in the last few episodes. As the agents leave, the dead who were resting underneath the film set are revived and begin to dance passionately, reinforcing a theory Mulder made earlier in the episode.|$|E

5|$|Following {{this decline}} in her career, Hepburn took action to create her own {{comeback}} vehicle. She left <b>Hollywood</b> <b>to</b> {{look for a}} stage project, and signed on to star in Philip Barry's new play, The Philadelphia Story. It was tailored to showcase the actress, with the character of socialite Tracy Lord incorporating a mixture of humor, aggression, nervousness, and vulnerability. Howard Hughes, Hepburn's partner at the time, sensed that the play could be her ticket back to Hollywood stardom and bought her the film rights before it even debuted on stage. The Philadelphia Story first toured the United States, to positive reviews, and then opened in New York at the Schubert Theatre on March 28, 1939. It was a big hit, critically and financially, running for 417 performances and then going on a second successful tour.|$|E
5|$|In August 1942 Briskin's duties at Columbia {{were divided}} between Harry Cohn and Sydney Buchman, in {{anticipation}} of his being called up to active duty in the army. Briskin was called to active duty by September, with Buchman resigning his position as President of the Screen Writers Guild to handle Briskin's responsibilities at Columbia. While on active duty, Columbia continued to keep Briskin under contract, although at a reduced salary of $300 per week. One of Briskin's roles in the Army Signal Corps was recruiting industry personnel to serve as cameramen and photographers for the army. In a report lamenting the loss of talent from <b>Hollywood</b> <b>to</b> the armed services, Briskin {{was one of four}} producers cited, along with Darryl Zanuck, Hal Roach, and John Hay Whitney. In late March 1943 Briskin suffered a heart attack while on active military service. Briskin received a medical discharge from the Army Signal Corps in May 1944. During his military service, Briskin was awarded the Legion of Merit. In July 1944, Briskin returned to Columbia, detaching from the army with the rank of lieutenant colonel. Shortly after his return to civilian life, Briskin parted ways with Columbia in September 1944.|$|E
5|$|In September 1945, {{after he}} was {{released}} by the army, he returned to Piers Court with his family (another daughter, Harriet, had been born at Pixton in 1944) but {{spent much of the}} next seven years either in London, or travelling. In March 1946, he visited the Nuremberg trials, and later that year, he was in Spain for a celebration of the 400th anniversary of the death of Francisco de Vitoria, said to be the founder of international law. Waugh wrote up his experiences of the frustrations of postwar European travel in a novella, Scott-King's Modern Europe. In February 1947, he made the first of several trips to the United States, in the first instance to discuss filming of Brideshead. The project collapsed, but Waugh used his time in <b>Hollywood</b> <b>to</b> visit the Forest Lawn cemetery, which provided the basis for his satire of American perspectives on death, The Loved One. In 1951 he visited the Holy Land with his future biographer, Christopher Sykes, and in 1953, he travelled to Goa to witness the final exhibition before burial of the remains of the 16th century Jesuit missionary-priest Francis Xavier.|$|E

5|$|Riefenstahl {{produced}} and directed {{her own work}} called Das Blaue Licht ("The Blue Light") in 1932, co-written by Carl Mayer and BÃ©la BalÃ¡zs. This film won the Silver Medal at the Venice Film Festival, but was not universally well-received, for which Riefenstahl blamed the critics, {{many of whom were}} Jewish. Upon its 1938 re-release, the names of BalÃ¡zs and Sokal, both Jewish, were removed from the credits; some reports claim this was at Riefenstahl's behest. In the film, Riefenstahl played an innocent peasant girl who is hated by the villagers because they think she is diabolic and cast out. She is protected by a glowing mountain grotto. According to herself, Riefenstahl received invitations to travel to <b>Hollywood</b> <b>to</b> create films, but she refused them in favour of remaining in Germany with a boyfriend. The film attracted the attention of Hitler, who believed she epitomized the perfect German female. He saw talent in Riefenstahl and arranged a meeting.|$|E
