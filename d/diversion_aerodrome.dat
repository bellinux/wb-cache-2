Manchester Airport {{was to be}} adapted to accept Airbus A380 aircraft, {{as part of the}} larger expansion at the airport and would be certified as a <b>diversion</b> <b>aerodrome</b> for A380 flights.|$|E

By September 1947 the Station was under the command of Group Captain Edward Laine, however following the disbandment of No. 11 Air Gunnery School in October, the future of RAF Jurby became uncertain. One suggestion was that the Station would become a venue for ATC training.In 1948 various fixtures of the Station were sold off by tender, these included 9 Blister hangars and 20 Nissen huts. In the immediate post-war period the Station had also been used as a <b>diversion</b> <b>aerodrome</b> for Ronaldsway Airport - much as had Hall Caine Airport before the war - and this availability continued following the Station's placement on care and maintenance. Numerous diversions continued due to Ronaldsway's susceptibility to advection fog, however due to the down grading of the airfield facilities at Jurby approach options were limited and it afforded no ability for night operations.This use as a diversionary airport for Ronaldsway continued through 1949 and into the 1950s. An agreement was made with the Air Ministry to enable the use of the Station and ground staff from Ronaldsway would be transported to Jurby in order to support the operation.|$|E
