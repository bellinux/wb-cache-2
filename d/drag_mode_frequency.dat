40|$|We {{study the}} {{breathing}} <b>mode</b> <b>frequencies</b> of a rotating Fermi gas {{trapped in a}} harmonic plus radial quartic potential. We find that as the radial anharmonicity increases, the lowest order radial <b>mode</b> <b>frequency</b> increases while the next lowest order radial <b>mode</b> <b>frequency</b> decreases. Then at a critical anharmonicity, these two modes merge and beyond this merge the cloud is unstable against the oscillations. The critical anharmonicity depends on both rotational frequency and the chemical potential. As {{a result of the}} large chemical potential in the BCS regime, even with a weak anharmonicity the lowest order <b>mode</b> <b>frequency</b> increases with decreasing the attractive interaction.

If the exciting forces frequency is near by the resonance frequency of room structure or the sound <b>mode</b> <b>frequency</b> of the room, the pressure level of coupled interior sound fields will be enhanced.

40|$|Whirl flutter is a {{specific}} type of flutter instability, relevant for turboprop aircraft, caused by the effect of rotating parts as a propeller or a gas-turbine engine rotor. The proposed optimisation-based analytical procedure is used to determine the critical values of the engine attachment stiffness parameters for the preselected flutter speed. For the half-span model, two design variables are used. The objective function is defined as the minimization of the engine vibration <b>mode</b> <b>frequency</b> sum. Design constraints keep the engine frequency ratio and the flutter stability at the selected velocity. However, application of a full-span model is necessary in some cases. In this case, special models of both symmetric and antisymmetric engine vibrations and four design variables must be used. Design constraints maintain the pitch <b>mode</b> <b>frequency</b> ratio, the yaw <b>mode</b> <b>frequency</b> ratio and the critical <b>mode</b> <b>frequency</b> ratio. Critical <b>modes</b> are dependent on the relation between the rotational direction of both propellers (identical or inverse). A flutter design constraint is applied as well.

Free oscillation freguencies of the heterogeneous earth were computed by the xyz algorithm. Further we derived an analytic expression of partial derivatives of eigenfrequency with respect to the expansion coefficients, and performed a numerical test to verify {{whether or not it is}} possible to estimate the heterogeneity of the earth's structure by the inversion of noemal <b>mode</b> <b>frequencies.</b> When the earth is assumed to be elastically isotropic spheroid with short polar and long equatorial radii, frequency spectra affected by longitudinal heterogeneity terms, Pιm(cosθ) (sinmΦ, cosmΦ) (m≠ 0), for given values of ι and m coincide with each other, because these two terms describe the same heterogeneity when the earth is rotated by π/ 2 m around rotation axis. In such a case, we cannot determine accurately the expansion coefficients of tha two heterogeneity terms by inversion of normal <b>mode</b> <b>frequencies,</b> whereas the coefficients of the latitudinal heterogeneity Pι 0 (cosθ) can be precisely determined.
