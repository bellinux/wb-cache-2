50|$|Fashions in the 1850s through 1880s accented large crinolines, {{cumbersome}} bustles {{and padded}} busts with tiny waists laced into ‘steam-moulded corsetry’. ‘Tight-lacing’ formed {{two sides of}} the argument around dress reform: for dress reformists, corsets were a dangerous moral ‘evil’, promoting promiscuous views of female bodies and superficial dalliance into fashion whims. The obvious health risks, including damaged and rearranged internal organs, compromised fertility; weakness and general depletion of health were also blamed on excessive corsetry. Eventually, the reformers' critique of the corset joined a throng of voices clamoring against tightlacing, which became gradually more common and extreme as the 19th century progressed. Preachers inveighed against tightlacing, <b>doctors</b> <b>counseled</b> patients against it and journalists wrote articles condemning the vanity and frivolity of women who would sacrifice their health for the sake of fashion.

Design: A cross-sectional questionnaire based survey. Method: Resident Doctors attending a national update course in obstetrics and gynaecology. Results: Most of the doctors had good knowledge of Vasectomy. More than four-fifth of the doctors were convinced that the average Nigerian male will not ac-cept vasectomy when indicated while more than three-fifth consider BTL a more appropriate option for per-manent contraception in our setting. Forty one point three percent of the doctors will opt for vasectomy or urge their husbands to. Reasons for opposition to vas-ectomy were socio-cultural (21. 3 %), religious (13. 1 %) and psychological (41. 0 %), 24. 6 % had no specific rea-sons. While 89. 4 % of the <b>doctors</b> <b>counselled</b> often for BTL only 5. 8 % did for vasectomy. Conclusion: The Doctors showed good knowledge of vasectomy but most were poorly disposed towards use of vasectomy.

60|$|One summer, a {{few years}} later, the water on Lake Huron sank lower than it had ever been known to sink before. It was a very dry season in the back country, and the rivers brought down very diminished streams into the great basins. Foot by foot, {{the level of the}} lake fell slowly, till many of the wharves were left high and dry, and the vessels could only come {{alongside}} in very few deep places. Captain Pierpoint had suffered much from sleeplessness, combined with Canadian ague, for some years past, but this particular summer his mind was very evidently much troubled. For some unaccountable reason, he watched the falling of the river with the intensest anxiety, and after it had passed a certain point, his interest in the question became painfully keen. Though the fever and the ague gained upon him from day to day, and his <b>doctor</b> <b>counselled</b> perfect quiet, he was perpetually consulting charts, and making measurements of the configuration which the coast had now reached, especially at the upper end of Lake Huron. At last, his mind seemed almost to give way, and weak and feverish as he was, he insisted, the first time for many seasons, that he must take a trip upon the water. Remonstrance was quite useless; he would go on the lake again, he said, if it killed him. So he hired one of the little steam pleasure yachts which are always to let in numbers at Detroit, and started with his wife and her brother, a young surgeon, for a month's cruise into Lake Superior.|$|R

This study investigated the experience of humour of people with Asperger’s syndrome. It aimed to explore the lived experience of this phenomenon. A literature review was undertaken which revealed that people with Asperger’s syndrome are thought not {{to have a sense of}} humour and a number of theories are proposed to explain the difficulties that may be experienced in regard to humour. In order to gain insight into the lived experience a qualitative approach was adopted using semi structured research interviews with eight, adult, male participants. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was then used to illuminate the “insider perspective”. The analysis highlighted four main themes, the experience of difference, the experience of learning, what I find amusing and how I use humour. It was suggested that people with Asperger’s syndrome do have a sense of humour but they may need to put in extra effort to develop it. The importance of individuality and acceptance of differences was also recognised. The report highlighted a number of clinical implications such as the role humour plays in social interactions and the importance of asking questions rather than making assumptions when working with people with Asperger’s syndrome...|$|R
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} of the University of Wolverhampton for the degree of <b>Doctor</b> of <b>Counselling</b> PsychologyUntil recently, research into dreaming followed the reductionist paradigm within a Freudian framework. This line of enquiry has failed to date to provide a meaningful relationship between neuropsychology and dreaming. As a result, theory development has halted, original therapeutic approaches outside the analytic tradition are scarce, and practitioners are disempowered when confronted with dream material. However, in recent years the concept of consciousness is back on the scientific agenda and the study of the subjective experience of dreaming is once again possible. Eight coinquirers employed Heron’s (1996) co-operative inquiry. We collaboratively explored our experience of dreaming holding seven meetings over six months. Paradoxically, we found that our experiences and understandings were similar and conflicting, mirroring the current debates in dream research. Our findings indicate strong links with waking consciousness, and that dreams are a source of entertainment, insight, problem solving and angst. Our study also highlighted that directing our awareness altered the nature of our dreams and our perceptions. Implications for Counselling Psychology theory, practice and research are discussed. It is argued that intentionality is a key concept and should be incorporated in Counselling Psychology research, theory and practice...|$|R

The aim was to find out more information about the different types of Indian indigenous interventions that may currently be used by these professionals. The study also bridges the gap in the literature about the lack of research on the practical uses and applications of Indian indigenous counselling skills in the UK. The study reports data from six face-to-face open-ended semi-structured interviews with Indian counsellors who have been trained in Western psychotherapeutic approaches and have knowledge of Indian psychotherapeutic approaches. The research was analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Firstly, the analysis concluded the use of several Indian indigenous interventions used by the participants, such as Prekshadhyan which can be used for psychosomatic pain relief, Jain virtue of forgiveness which can be useful for working with sexual abuse, use of spirituality and cultural beliefs for bereavement, and so on. Secondly, the analysis identified some of the most common barriers to therapy (e. g. stigmas and taboos) experienced by Indian clients in the UK, and it provided suggestions on how to overcome these. Finally, the analysis suggested factors that therapists should pay attention to (e. g. client context and use of Indian languages) in order to maximise Indian clients’ engagement in therapy and to minimise their exclusion from it...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: (1) To {{investigate}} patients' {{experience of}} changes in their blood pressure (BP) in an every day setting and the accuracy of patients' predictions; and (2) to examine what influences patients' belief that they can tell when their BP is up. Subjects: A total of 102 hypertensive patients were recruited sequentially as they presented for routine BP checks. The setting was an inner city general practice. Design: Patients attended for BP checks on a weekly basis. Before each check they were asked whether they thought their BP was higher, lower or the same as usual. Subjects were classified as predictors if {{they thought they could}} tell when their BP was up. On completing their series of BP checks each subject completed symptom and Hospital Anxiety and Depression questionnaires. Main outcome measures: Accuracy of BP predictions, BP levels and variability, number of symptoms reported and anxiety level. Results: One hundred and two hypertensive patients entered the study of whom 51 patients were predictors. The majority (86 %) of predictors could not accurately predict their BP. There {{were no significant differences in}} either BP or variability between predictors and non-predictors. Predictors were significantly more anxious and reported more symptoms than non-predictors. Conclusions: For the majority of predictors there is no significant relationship between predictions of BP and clinical measurements. Predictor status is associated with the reporting of more symptoms and higher levels of anxiety. <b>Doctors</b> should <b>counsel</b> patients against using subjective BP assessments to guide their use of antihypertensive medication...|$|R
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} of the University of Wolverhampton for the degree of <b>Doctor</b> in <b>Counselling</b> Psychology. Internet-based therapies are growing in number and popularity and cover a diverse range of practices for both individuals and groups. In concordance with the hyperpersonal theory and online disinhibition effect, people more readily disclose personal information when conducted via the internet. Due to technological constraints and social interactions, a non-standard language developed and has widely been termed “netspeak” (Crystal, 2006). Emotional words are processed differently to non-emotional words. Further, people do not connect with abbreviations on the same emotional level as they do when the words are written in full. Three studies were conducted: the first focused on assessing if a short emotionally evocative mini-biography had an emotional impact on participants. This material was then used in a second study which was a mass-testing of 62 young people on whether netspeak can change the impact on mood. The study used 3 conditions whereby participants re-wrote the mini-biography into either full English, using Netspeak or in their own words. A new vignette was created from the Netspeak condition to use as material for a third study. This final study was conducted via email into how much a psychological therapist understood what had been written in the Netspeak vignette. No differences were seen from re-writing an emotional biography in netspeak to English. Although psychological therapists demonstrated some understanding of the netspeak vignette, there was evidence of misinterpretation, presumption and misunderstanding suggesting that there may be some barrier to communication in internet therapy. The clinical implications of this research suggest that psychological therapists need to reflect on their practice in order {{to be aware of the}} level of assumption that can be made during therapy...|$|R
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} of the University of Wolverhampton for the degree of <b>Doctor</b> of <b>Counselling</b> Psychology. Objectives: Inclusion of sociopolitical context in therapeutic interventions is under-researched, largely limited to practitioners’ addressing diversity issues in therapy. Relevant studies have shown both trainees and qualified practitioners experience anxiety and discomfort associated with uncertainties about effectively incorporating diversity and sociopolitical context. Although various models exist to aid systematic case conceptualisation incorporating sociopolitical factors, these are not widely used. The majority of relevant literature continues to concentrate on idiosyncratic conceptual models specific to theoretical approaches. This study aimed to discover how qualified practitioners currently conceptualise and incorporate diversity and sociopolitical factors into practice. Design: Given the lack of research available to inform the area, a grounded theory study was conducted as an exploratory exercise. The qualitative approach was adopted to investigate practitioners’ subjective experiences of their current practice. Constructivist assumptions underpinned the approach to the data, leading to use of Charmaz’s (2006) version of the grounded theory approach. Method: Theoretical sampling was used to recruit the 13 participants. Two focus groups and 8 individual interviews were conducted. Analysis: Two models emerged, representing the processes practitioners engaged in to “find a comfortable fit”, and the range of contexts within which the processes took place. Personal and professional dissonance emerged as a central feature of practitioner development. Discussion: The study highlighted the contribution of dissonance and the situated nature of the practitioner as major contributors affecting how sociopolitical issues are conceptualised and addressed in therapy. Further research is needed to clarify how these factors may most usefully contribute to best practice. However, multiple ecological contexts cited as levels of influence add a degree of complexity that will require operationalizing by those wishing to investigate this area in the future...|$|R

The literature review produced for this thesis systematically analysed qualitative studies of cognitive therapy using a methodology checklist and a meta-synthesis technique. Ten papers which used qualitative analysis to look at clients’ experiences of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) met the selection criteria. Seven themes emerged. Three were linked to a therapeutic relationships theme; the trusted listener, power and authority and others like me. Four were linked to the impact of cognitive therapy theme; empowering information, analysing the problem, thinking differently and doing things differently. It was concluded that future research should focus on the components of cognitive therapy and that differences in technique between CBT and Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy (REBT) should be explored via a qualitative study of clients’ experiences of REBT. A qualitative approach was taken to look at clients’ experiences of REBT. Seven participants were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide and the resulting transcripts were analysed using interpretive phenomenological analysis. Three themes emerged: one which looked at {{what it was like to}} have mental health problems; a second, which looked at clients’ expectations and experiences of the more technical aspects of therapy, and a third which examined the therapeutic relationship. All of the participants appeared to value therapy. However, the extent to which they knew about and used the theory and philosophy of REBT varied greatly. These results suggest that further research needs to be carried out which looks at how people benefit from therapy as clients views may differ from those of therapists. A critical appraisal of the research process was written using the REBT model to reflect the experience of producing the thesis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{percentage}} of women giving birth {{after the age of}} 35 increased in many western countries. The number of women remaining childless also increased, mostly due to aging oocytes. The method of oocyte donation offers the possibility for infertile older women to become pregnant. Gestation after oocyte-donation-IVF, however, is not without risks for the mother, especially at advanced age. Case presentation An infertile woman went abroad for oocyte-donation-IVF, since this treatment is not offered in The Netherlands after the age of 45. The first oocyte donation treatment resulted in multiple gestation, but was ended by induced abortion: the woman could not cope with the idea of being pregnant with twins. During the second pregnancy after oocyte donation, at the age of 50, she was mentally more stable. The pregnancy, again a multiple gestation, was uneventful until delivery. Immediately after delivery the woman had hypertension with nausea and vomiting. A few hours later she had an eclamptic fit. HELLP-syndrome was diagnosed. She died due to cerebral haemorrhage. Conclusion In The Netherlands, the age limit for women receiving donor oocytes is 45 years and commercial oocyte donation is forbidden by law. In other countries there is no age limit, the reason why some women are going abroad to receive the treatment of their choice. Advanced age, IVF and twin pregnancy are all risk factors for pre-eclampsia, the leading cause of maternal death in The Netherlands. Patient autonomy is an important ethical principle, but doctors are also bound to the principle of 'not doing harm', and do have the right to refuse medical treatment such as IVF-treatment. The discussion whether women above 50 should have children is still not closed. If the decision is made to offer this treatment to a woman at advanced age, the <b>doctor</b> should <b>counsel</b> her intensively about the risks before treatment is started. </p...|$|R

The findings showed that <b>doctors</b> encouraged and <b>counselled</b> patients regarding weight-loss, mainly giving dietary advice, but did not routinely weigh them. Patients accepted responsibility for losing weight, trusted their doctors, valued their advice highly and did not want referrals to gymnasiums or dieticians. They expected doctors to advise them practically about exercise, diet and weight-loss goals, weigh them regularly and communicate effectively. They believed that doctor-patient relationships and interaction are important in weight-loss management, patients should be treated on an individual basis and the process should be empowering. Medical intervention costs were not problematic for this group. Generally patients were satisfied with their doctors but there were areas concerning patients’ expectations that primary care doctors should take cognisance of...|$|R
60|$|Miss Martineau is at some {{pains to}} assure us on several {{occasions}} {{that it was the}} need of utterance now and always that drove her to write, and that money, although welcome when it came, was never her motive. This perhaps a little savours of affectation. Nobody would dream of suspecting Miss Martineau of writing anything that she did not believe to be true or useful merely for the sake of money. But there is plenty of evidence that the prospect of payment stirred her to true and useful work, as it does many other authors by profession, and as it does the followers of all professions whatever. She puts the case fairly enough in another place (i. 422):--'Every author is in a manner an adventurer; and no one was ever more decidedly so than myself; but the difference between one kind of adventurer and another is, I believe, simply this--that the one has something to say which presses for utterance, and is uttered at length without a view to future fortunes; while the other has a sort of general inclination towards literature, without any specific need of utterance, and a very definite desire for the honours and rewards of the literary career.' Even in the latter case, however, honest journeyman's work enough is done in literature by men and women who seek nothing higher than a reputable source of income. Miss Martineau did, no doubt, seek objects far higher and more generous than income, but she lived on the income which literature brought to her; and there seems a certain failure of her usually admirable common sense in making any ado about so simple a matter. When <b>doctors</b> and <b>counsel</b> refuse their guineas, and the parson declines a stipend, it will be quite soon enough for the author to be especially anxious to show that he has a right to regard money much {{as the rest of the}} human race regard it.|$|R
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} of the University of Wolverhampton for the degree of <b>Doctor</b> of <b>Counselling</b> PsychologySome seven percent of children in the general population are affected by Specific Language Impairment and/or Pragmatic Language Impairment with numerous cases undiagnosed. It is known that difficulty in communication affects psychosocial functioning and {{is likely to be a}} source of mental distress but the data on people’s access to and benefit from psychological intervention are limited. There is also limited understanding of psychologists’ capacity to meet these clients’ needs although their problems continue into adulthood. This research questions the population of counselling and clinical psychologists about their knowledge and experience of these disorders using an electronic questionnaire. Qualitative methods were then adopted with three participants with SLI/PLI and four psychologist practitioners familiar with such clients; this involved semi-structured interviews analysed using IPA and TA respectively. The purpose was to interpret and develop the clients' lived experiences into themes which were then used to look for possible connecting themes in the psychologists’ transcripts. This process was termed "interconnection" and was intended to reveal the coincidence and convergence of the two sides of the client/psychologist dyad. Results showed that whereas findings demonstrated the young men possessed a spectrum of coping and defence strategies as constituent parts of resilience, including self-esteem, self-identity and self-efficacy, the psychologists did not see the client as a congruent whole, addressing either their impairment or their mental health problem. Client resiliencies were not used in therapy and psychosocial difficulties were not recognised as a focus of distress although they did endeavour to modify their therapeutic approaches. Finally, consideration is given to whether the research aim is met, the implications for counselling psychology and possible future research. It is proposed that this methodology of interconnection has the potential to provide a novel approach to inform any future research and service development for this and other client groups in the way it takes patients/clients into account and connects them with professional working...|$|R
40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} of the University of Wolverhampton for the degree of <b>Doctor</b> of <b>Counselling</b> Psychology“Prison self-injury rate accelerates at four times the rise in population” (The Howard League for Penal Reform; 2008 a) The rise in self-harm figures in forensic settings in 2003 may largely be due to the improvement in the reporting of self-harm levels in prisons in December 2002. However it does not account for the continued rise in self-harm figures during the years that followed. Despite the increase, there have been few interventions to support prisoners who self-harm, particularly in remand settings. For this purpose the Carousel programme was designed by a counselling psychologist specifically {{to meet the demands of}} the female remand population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of Carousel. Forty women who had a history of deliberate self-harm entered and completed the programme through means of self-referral. The study employed both a quantitative and qualitative methodology to evaluate the programme. Participants were interviewed and assessed both at the start and completion of Carousel. This included monitoring levels of self-harm incidents, levels of anxiety and depression using the 14 -item Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (Zigmond & Snaith, 1983), and coping levels using the 60 -item Coping Styles Questionnaire (CSQ) (Roger, Jarvis & Najarian, 1993). Results showed a significant decrease in depression and anxiety, a reduction in self-harm levels and a change of coping styles in the desired direction. Qualitative methodology using content analysis was employed to ascertain the components of the programme which were deemed most helpful or unhelpful to the participants. Findings suggest that the most useful components within the programme are coping strategies, management of self-harm behaviours, antecedent, behaviour and consequence (ABC) sessions and the understanding of the brain and associated emotions with self-harm behaviours. Implications for counselling psychology and clinical practice are highlighted and limitations of the current study and directions for future research suggested within the report...|$|R
40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} of the University of Wolverhampton for the degree of <b>Doctor</b> of <b>Counselling</b> PsychologyThis thesis comprises three main sections: a literature review, research report, and a critical appraisal of the research process. The literature reviewed is the existing research relating to trust as a construct. An attempt is made to clarify the conceptual confusion that exists in the area, by suggesting a comprehensive definition of what is meant by the term trust for the purposes of both the current study and future research. The importance of trust in relation to mental health and therapeutic relationships is discussed. Current measures of the construct are critically examined, and the ‘scientist’ versus ‘humanist’ divide is explored. It is concluded that a new multidimensional trust measure is required to further research efforts in the area. The aim of the research project was to develop a trust measure to form a part of a larger endeavour to operationalise the concept of mental health via key set of basic human emotions and responses. The research reported in Section 2 consists of a Pilot Test, Main Study, and follow up validation study of a new multidimensional measure of trust. Three bases of trust were hypothesised and tested. These were: self trust, interpersonal trust, and environmental trust (that is, trust in wider social, cultural, or political context). A new measure was constructed and validity tested using an inductive approach, and the relationship between trust and trait anxiety was also examined. The results supported the hypothesis that trust is a multidimensional construct, and demonstrated a strong relationship between trust and trait anxiety. It is hoped that this work will rekindle research interest in this important area. The final section is the researcher’s critical appraisal of the research process based on her personal research diary. It is a reflective piece that examines the impact of the research on the researcher (and vice versa) and the critical events in the research process...|$|R
40|$|Rob Brandenburg is the {{recipient}} of an AACC Research Grant awarded at the AACC’s April 2006 Conference. He has recently completed his doctoral thesis on the influence of personality type on the male experience of midlife within the <b>Doctor</b> of <b>Counselling</b> program at the University of South Australia. Dr Kurt Lushington is Rob’s supervisor in his research. This article focuses on career issues faced by men at the midpoint of their lives and is an edited version of the literature review. Lifespan developmental theory suggests that midlife is an important stage where men typically re-evaluate major areas of their life including career/work. Midlife can be looked at from several perspectives including Jung’s theory of personality type which has since been interpreted and extended by Katherine Briggs and Isabel Myers to form the basis of the Myers-Briggs Type Inventory®. This literature review examines the influence of Jungian/Myers-Briggs personality type on the male midlife experience of career and work. It can be concluded that personality type does impact on the male midlife experience and thus has implications for career practitioners counselling men in midlife. Jung, Myers and Briggs Jung (1960) was one of the earlier social scientists to describe a midlife transition but despite his many ideas on adult development, he did not attract many disciples among other developmental theorists. Staude (1981), in his book The Adult Development of C. G. Jung contends that this was probably because Jung’s basic world view and philosophical assumptions differed radically from those of mainstream psychology. An example of an alternative approach to the traditional developmental psychology view of lifespan development is evident in the Jungian use of metaphor and archetypal terms to describe the inner journey of self-discovery. One metaphor sometimes used is that of the “heroic journey ” – the “calling ” to adventure, an acceptance of the call, the struggle to overcome major ordeals and the successfu...|$|R
40|$|Background: Physical {{inactivity}} and sedentary behaviour {{are common}} amongst breast cancer survivors. These behaviours {{are associated with}} an increased risk of comorbidities such as heart disease, diabetes and other cancers. Commercially available, wearable activity trackers (WATs) have potential utility as behavioural interventions to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour within this population. Purpose: The purpose of the study is to explore the acceptability and usability of consumer WAT amongst postmenopausal breast cancer survivors. Methods: Fourteen participants tested two to three randomly assigned trackers from six available models (Fitbit One, Jawbone Up 24, Garmin Vivofit 2, Garmin Vivosmart, Garmin Vivoactive and Polar A 300). Participants wore each device for 2  weeks, followed by a 1 -week washout period before wearing the next device. Four focus groups employing a semi-structured interview guide explored user perceptions and experiences. We used a thematic analysis approach to analyse focus group transcripts. Results: Five themes emerged from our data: (1) trackers’ increased self-awareness and motivation, (2) breast cancer survivors’ confidence and comfort with wearable technology, (3) preferred and disliked features of WAT, (4) concerns related to the disease and (5) peer support and doctor monitoring were possible strategies for WAT application. Conclusions: WATs are perceived as useful and acceptable interventions by postmenopausal breast cancer survivors. Effective WAT interventions may benefit from taking advantage of the simple features of the trackers paired with other behavioural change techniques, such as specialist <b>counselling,</b> <b>doctor</b> monitoring and peer support, along with simple manual instructions...|$|R
