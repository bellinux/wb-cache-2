40|$|Background: Perennial Ryegrass is a {{major cause}} of {{rhinitis}} in spring and early summer. Bahia grass, Paspalum notatum, flowers late into summer and could account for allergic rhinitis at this time. We determined the frequency of serum immunoglobulin (Ig) E reactivity with Bahia grass in Ryegrass pollen allergic patients and investigated IgE cross-reactivity between Bahia and Ryegrass. Methods: Serum from 33 Ryegrass pollen allergic patients and 12 nonatopic donors were tested for IgE reactivity with Bahia and Ryegrass pollen extracts (PE) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), western blotting and inhibition ELISA. Allergen-specific antibodies from a pool of sera from allergic donors were affinity purified and tested for IgE cross-reactivity. Results: Seventy-eight per cent of the sera had IgE reactivity with Bahia grass, but more weakly than with Ryegrass. Antibodies eluted from the major Ryegrass pollen allergens, Lol p 1 and Lol p 5, showed IgE reactivity with allergens of Ryegrass and Canary but not Bahia or Bermuda grasses. Timothy, Canary and Ryegrass inhibited IgE reactivity with Ryegrass and Bahia <b>grass,</b> whereas Bahia, <b>Johnson</b> and Bermuda <b>grass</b> did not inhibit IgE reactivity with Ryegrass. Conclusions: The majority of Ryegrass allergic patients also showed serum IgE reactivity with Bahia grass PE. However, Bahia grass and Ryegrass had only limited IgE cross-reactivity indicating that Bahia grass should be considered in diagnosis and treatment of patients with hay fever late in' the grass pollen season...|$|R

5000|$|There are 15 aphid {{species that}} can non-persistently {{transmit}} MDMV. [...] The aphids are mainly {{members of the}} Poaceae family. MDMV overwinters in alternate hosts. These hosts range is sorghum, maize, and <b>Johnson</b> <b>grass.</b> Symptoms appear six weeks after aphids feed and transmit the virus. The aphid acquires the virus within seconds of feeding on an infected plant, either maize, <b>Johnson</b> <b>grass,</b> or sorghum. There is no latent period for transmission to new host plants. After acquiring MDMV an aphid is able to transmit the virus within 15-30 minutes. Aphids do not retain MDMV after molting.|$|E

50|$|The rat {{has been}} shown in a study that {{analyzed}} cheek pouch contents of several individuals to eat leaves of grasses and some perennials, stems, and seeds. Seeds of <b>Johnson</b> <b>grass</b> and cultivated oats make up the largest part of their diet. Breeding has not been studied extensively but generally they have a promiscuous mating system, mature early, mate all year with peaks in spring and summer, and have about 3 young per brood.|$|E
50|$|MDMV prefers warm {{to average}} temperatures. <b>Johnson</b> <b>grass</b> {{infected}} with MDMV {{in the surrounding}} environment can increase the disease on maize. MDMV is a cultivated virus that mainly occurs in the United States and Australia. MDMV does not overwinter in Minnesota and Wisconsin, which makes the source of inoculum in these northern states unclear. During infection after periods of cool night temperatures, about 60 °F, the plants may exhibit signs of the disease such as blotches or streaks of red.|$|E
50|$|The virus {{can also}} be spread through the seed or {{mechanically}} by leaf rubbing of <b>Johnson</b> <b>grass</b> and sorghum. MDMV {{in the field is}} not typically transmitted by seed or mechanically, it is more prevalent in greenhouses. Depending on the hybrid, most maize plants will show higher rates of disease when infected earlier in the growing stage. The pathogen itself is a flexuous, rod-shaped virus measuring 12 x 750 nm. There are antiserum kits that can confirm the viruses identity.|$|E

50|$|The ligule {{is part of}} {{the leaf}} that is found at the {{junction}} of the blade and sheath of the leaf. It may take several forms, but it is commonly some form of translucent membrane or a fringe of hairs. The membranous ligule can be very short 1 - 2 mm (Kentucky bluegrass, Poa pratensis) to very long 10 - 20 mm (<b>Johnson</b> <b>grass,</b> Sorghum halepense), it can also be smooth on the edge or very ragged. Some grasses do not have a ligule, for example barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli).|$|E
50|$|Maize Dwarf Mosaic Virus can {{be managed}} in several ways. One way is {{the removal of the}} local {{population}} of <b>Johnson</b> <b>grass</b> as this can harbor the disease. It is best if all producers (farmers) in the area participate in this practice or the disease can remain in sporadic plant populations and be spread in the ways described above (Lipps & Mills, n.d.). Another way to help avoid MDMV is by selecting corn varieties that are tolerant of the virus and by planting corn crops earlier in the season to help seedlings avoid key aphid population times (Lipps & Mills, n.d.).|$|E
50|$|Respiratory allergies are an {{occupational}} disease that develop in food service workers. Previous studies detected 40 allergens from wheat; some cross-reacted with rye proteins and a few cross-reacted with grass pollens. A later study showed that baker's allergy extend over {{a broad range of}} cereal grasses (wheat, durum wheat, triticale, cereal rye, barley, rye grass, oats, canary grass, rice, maize, sorghum and <b>Johnson</b> <b>grass)</b> though the greatest similarities were seen between wheat and rye, and that these allergies show cross reactivity between seed proteins and pollen proteins, including a prominent crossreactivity between the common environment rye pollen and wheat gluten.|$|E
50|$|Maize Dwarf Mosaic Virus {{is spread}} by seed, by {{infected}} leaves rubbing on non-infected leaves {{and perhaps most}} commonly, via aphids (Lipps & Mills, n.d.). These aphids become carriers after they feed on plants such as <b>Johnson</b> <b>grass,</b> corn or sorghum, or other grass species that are infected with MDMV. Broadleaf plants do not become infected with MDMV (The CIMMYT Maize Program). Aphids transmit Maize Dwarf Mosaic Virus disease effectively fifteen to thirty minutes after feeding on infected plants when by spreading the virus to the susceptible plants after they have flown or are blown onto a nearby corn crop and will start to feed (“Maize Dwarf Mosaic Virus,” n.d.).|$|E
50|$|The rice stink bug is a {{significant}} pest of rice crops in the southern U.S., including Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas (the Rice Belt). This agricultural pest is known to attack cereal crops with small seeds, particularly wheat, sorghum, and rice. The insect also lives in wild grasses such as <b>Johnson</b> <b>grass,</b> barnyard grass, and sedge, making control of cash crops difficult. They are occasionally found on other crops in which grasses are prevalent between the rows, even though the insect may ignore the field crop. The insect is extremely mobile and is known to travel en masse {{in and out of}} fields quickly in search of more favorable foods.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} {{cultural}} controls are effective against sorghum downy mildew. In areas where oospores {{are the principal}} source of inoculum, {{such as in the}} United States, crop rotation is an effective strategy, as oospores will be stimulated to germinate by both host and non-host crops, but {{will not be able to}} infect plants apart from corn, sorghum, and <b>Johnson</b> <b>grass.</b> Flax (Linum usitatissimum) is an example of a trap crop that is used to reduce the amount of oospore inoculum in the soil, before planting a susceptible crop like sorghum or maize. Deep tillage also reduces the amount of oospores surviving in the soil and therefore the incidence of the disease.|$|E
50|$|The main {{threat to}} the species is the loss and {{degradation}} of its habitat, caused {{in part by the}} invasion of non-native plant species and the overgrowth of native plants. The worst invasive species is <b>Johnson</b> <b>grass</b> (Sorghum halepense). The orchid grows naturally next to various species of horse-tail and other marsh plants, and when these plants become too dense the orchid cannot penetrate the layers of vegetation. Horse-tails also outcompete the orchid. It is likely that fire suppression is a threat, as fires naturally thin competing vegetation. Grazing of cattle and other livestock is a threat, though grazing has been eliminated in the most sensitive cienega sites in most locations. Changes in the hydrology of these wetland sites is a {{threat to the}} habitat, which is still recovering from draining operations initiated over a century ago. Pumping of groundwater reduces available water in the habitat.|$|E
