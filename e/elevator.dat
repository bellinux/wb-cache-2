5|$|During {{the initial}} investigation, police had noted {{undisturbed}} human excrement in the <b>elevator</b> shaft, which Conley {{said he had}} left there before the murder. Use of the <b>elevator</b> on the Monday after the murder crushed the excrement, which Slaton concluded was {{an indication that the}} <b>elevator</b> could not have been used as described by Conley, casting doubt on his testimony.|$|E
5|$|The <b>elevator</b> is {{also very}} narrow in chord like the rudder, and the B-52 suffers from limited <b>elevator</b> control authority. For long term pitch trim and {{airspeed}} changes the aircraft uses an all-moving tail with the <b>elevator</b> used for small adjustments within a stabilizer setting. The stabilizer is adjustable through 13 degrees of movement (nine up, four down) and is crucial to operations during {{take off and landing}} due to large pitch changes induced by flap application.|$|E
5|$|The <b>elevator</b> to the {{commuter}} rail platform was also temporarily {{out of service}} for maintenance during the same period; a shuttle bus ran between Harvard, Porter and Waltham. The Red Line <b>elevator</b> was returned to service on June 22, 2012, and {{the commuter}} rail <b>elevator</b> returned to service on July 30, 2012.|$|E
50|$|The <b>elevators</b> {{in each of}} the {{residence}} halls are divided based on a low rise and high rise system. In Morrill, the low rise <b>elevators</b> go to floors 1, 3-14 and the high rise <b>elevators</b> goes to floors 1,3, 15-23. Only authorized officials can access floor 2 using the <b>elevators.</b> In Lincoln, low rise <b>elevators</b> reach floors 1-14, while high rise <b>elevators</b> reach floors 1,2, and 15-23. Each side of the building has 3 <b>elevators.</b>|$|R
50|$|As of January 2008, Spain is {{the nation}} with the most <b>elevators</b> {{installed}} in the world, with 950,000 <b>elevators</b> installed that run {{more than one hundred}} million lifts every day, followed by United States with 700,000 <b>elevators</b> installed and China with 610,000 <b>elevators</b> installed since 1949. In Brazil, it is estimated that there are approximately 300,000 <b>elevators</b> currently in operation. The world's largest market for <b>elevators</b> is Italy, with more than 1,629 million euros of sales and 1,224 million euros of internal market.|$|R
50|$|In 1918, P&H bought 10 <b>elevators</b> from Louis Strong and Frederick Dowler, {{who were}} Calgary grain brokers. After buying more <b>elevators,</b> by 1920, P&H had 20 <b>elevators.</b>|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of a 2006 {{settlement}} of a lawsuit filed by the Boston Center for Independent Living and a group of individuals, the MBTA installed additional elevators at Porter and four other busy MBTA subway stations. The <b>elevator</b> to the Red Line was out of service for 15 months beginning in March 2011 for car replacement and the installation of a second, redundant, <b>elevator.</b> An accessible shuttle bus ran between Porter and Davis.|$|E

5|$|Hōshō {{was fitted}} with a net used as a crash barrier aft of the forward <b>elevator</b> between 10 March and 2 July 1925. The barrier was {{intended}} to prevent landing aircraft from colliding with aircraft preparing to take off, and stop them from falling into the open <b>elevator</b> well. The barrier was hydraulically operated and could be erected in three seconds.|$|E
50|$|On {{aircraft}} carriers, <b>elevators</b> carry aircraft {{between the}} flight deck and the hangar deck for operations or repairs. These <b>elevators</b> are designed for much greater capacity than other <b>elevators,</b> up to 200000 lb of aircraft and equipment. Smaller <b>elevators</b> lift munitions to {{the flight deck}} from magazines deep inside the ship.|$|R
50|$|The {{technology}} used in new installations {{depends on a}} variety of factors. Hydraulic <b>elevators</b> are cheaper, but installing cylinders greater than a certain length becomes impractical for very-high lift hoistways. For buildings of much over seven floors, traction <b>elevators</b> must be employed instead. Hydraulic <b>elevators</b> are usually slower than traction <b>elevators.</b>|$|R
50|$|Architecturally, this is important, as {{double-deck}} <b>elevators</b> occupy less building {{core space}} than traditional single-deck <b>elevators</b> {{do for the}} same level of traffic. In skyscrapers, this allows for much more efficient use of space, as the floor area required by <b>elevators</b> tends to be quite significant. The other main technique is shared-shaft <b>elevators,</b> where multiple <b>elevators</b> use different sections of the same shaft to serve different floors, with skylobbies separating the sections.|$|R
5|$|In 1999, Indiana farmer Vernon Hugh Bowman bought soybean crop {{seeds from}} a local grain <b>elevator</b> for his second crop of the season. He then saved seeds from his second crop to replant {{additional}} crops in later years. Bowman purchased these soybean seeds from the same <b>elevator</b> to which he and neighbors sold their soybean crops, {{many of which were}} transgenic, and the <b>elevator</b> sold these soybeans as commodities, not as seeds for planting. He tested the new seeds, and found that, as he had expected, some were transgenic and thus were resistant to glyphosate. He replanted seeds from the original second harvest in subsequent years for his second seasonal planting, supplementing them with more soybeans he bought at the <b>elevator.</b> He informed Monsanto of his activities.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{broaching}} is more involved. The {{process begins}} by clamping the workpiece into a special holding fixture, called a workholder, which mounts in the broaching machine. The broaching machine <b>elevator,</b> {{which is the}} part of the machine that moves the broach above the workholder, then lowers the broach through the workpiece. Once through, the broaching machine's puller, essentially a hook, grabs the pilot of the broach. The <b>elevator</b> then releases the top of the pilot and the puller pulls the broach through the workpiece completely. The workpiece is then removed from the machine and the broach is raised back up to reengage with the <b>elevator.</b> The broach usually only moves linearly, but sometimes it is also rotated to create a spiral spline or gun-barrel rifling.|$|E

5|$|SimTower {{allows the}} player {{to build and}} manage the {{operations}} of a modern, multi-use skyscraper. They must plan where to place facilities in the tower that include restaurants, condominiums, offices, hotel rooms, retail stores and elevators. To prevent tenants from vacating their properties, the player must keep their stress low by fulfilling their demands for medical centers, parking lots, recycling facilities, clean hotel rooms {{with the help of}} housekeepers, and an efficient transportation system, which involves managing <b>elevator</b> traffic. SimTower, which was built around an <b>elevator</b> simulation program, places a strong emphasis on good <b>elevator</b> management.|$|E

5|$|The {{monument}} {{is filled}} with ironwork, consisting of its stairs, <b>elevator</b> columns and associated tie beams, none of which supports {{the weight of the}} stonework. It was redesigned in 1958 to reduce congestion and improve the flow of visitors. Originally, visitors entered and exited {{the west side of the}} <b>elevator</b> on the observation floor, causing congestion. So the large landing at the 490-foot level was expanded to a full floor and the original spiral stair in the northeast corner between the 490- and 500-foot levels was replaced by two spiral stairs in the northeast and southeast corners. Now visitors exit the <b>elevator</b> on the observation floor, then walk down either spiral stair before reboarding the <b>elevator</b> for their trip back down.|$|E
50|$|The Guangzhou CTF Finance Centre has 95 <b>elevators,</b> {{including}} two <b>elevators</b> that {{are among the}} world's fastest. In 2014, manufacturer Hitachi announced that those two <b>elevators</b> {{would be able to}} reach 1,200 m/min. (44.7 mph) and would carry passengers through the 1,450 ft long shaft from the first to the 95th floor in approximately 43 seconds. These two <b>elevators</b> are used to bring hotel guests from the entrance to the lobby. In May 2016, the <b>elevators</b> were first tested and reached the promised maximum speed.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} short {{distance}} <b>elevators</b> located throughout the building. For example, four small capacity <b>elevators</b> exist that provide service only between floors two through eight. Two more <b>elevators</b> exist for service only between floors 38 - 41.|$|R

25|$|In 1910, Scott {{appointed}} another royal commission, the Magill Commission, {{to study}} the issue of grain <b>elevators.</b> In October, the commission rejected proposals to create government-owned <b>elevators,</b> opting instead for a system of <b>elevators</b> owned and operated co-operatively by farmers.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} way in which <b>elevators</b> {{movement}} produces work perturbing noises. The studies were made on two types of buildings: a modern building, with noiseless <b>elevators</b> and another one with old <b>elevators.</b> Also, the measurements took place during 900 - 1700, highlighting {{the way in}} which the noise level increases over the period when the <b>elevators</b> are most used: at the beginning and at the end of the work shift and at lunch break. This noise can be soften by using absorbent materials along with the replacing of the old <b>elevators</b> with new and performing ones. 1...|$|R

5|$|Agent Fox Mulder {{arrives at}} the civic center after {{what looks like a}} massacre; bodies lie on the {{sidewalk}} and in the foyer. Sheriff Spencer (John Cygan) explains that the suspect murdered four people from the <b>elevator</b> with his bare hands. His rampage ended when he was shot by a security guard. Spencer notes that seven other individuals have murdered twenty-two people in Franklin in the past six months. Mulder discovers that the LED display in the <b>elevator</b> has been damaged, and that the dead suspect has a green residue on his fingertips.|$|E
5|$|Ascending the {{staircase}} are bronze railings with mahogany banisters. The railings {{are decorated with}} the swastika symbol which, whilst mostly associated with Nazi Germany, has been traced {{back as far as}} the 3rd millennium B.C.E. in Asia. The stairway's newel posts, on the landing between the second and third floors, are a pair of bronze ram's heads, identical newel posts grace {{the bottom of the stairs}} as well. The second floor landing offers a view of the stained glass windows, all original, which were fully restored during the 1980s renovation. <b>Elevator</b> access is also located on the second floor landing, the <b>elevator</b> was a 1950s addition to the courthouse. Originally, to access the third floor, the only option was one of two staircases. Both staircases rose from the second floor landing to the third floor, one staircase was located to either side of the stairwell leading to the landing. When the <b>elevator</b> was installed {{the staircase}} on the left-hand side of the landing was removed.|$|E
