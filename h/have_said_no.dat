2500|$|The December 20, 2010 {{airing of}} Democracy Now! {{featured}} a segment titled [...] "Naomi Wolf vs. Jaclyn Friedman: Feminists Debate the Sexual Allegations Against Julian Assange" [...] in which Jaclyn Friedman argues the sexual assault allegations against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange shouldn't be dismissed {{just because they}} may be politically motivated. Wolf argues that the alleged victims should <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>no,</b> that they consented to having sex with Assange, that the charges are politically motivated and demean the cause of legitimate rape victims. The discussion took place shortly after the leaking of the Swedish police report on the incident.|$|E
2500|$|For {{three and}} a half years I dodged the war as much as I could - and I regret not having had the courage shown by the great Karl Liebknecht to say No and refuse to serve in the military. Of this I am ashamed. I used many means not to get shot and not to shoot [...] not once the worst means. But I would have used all means, all without exception, [...] had I been forced to do so: I wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>no</b> to bribery or any other {{punishable}} acts. Many did just the same.|$|E
2500|$|On December 2, it was {{announced}} that Harper's plan was to ask the Governor General to prorogue parliament, delaying a confidence vote until the new year. The coalition leadership sent a letter to Jean—who, at the time, was abroad conducting state visits to various European countries—informing her of the events, upon the receipt of which, Jean announced that she would cut her trip short and return to Ottawa [...] "in light of the current political situation in Canada." [...] Harper visited the Governor General at Rideau Hall, at approximately 9:30 am ET, on December 4. After consulting with the Prime Minister and other advisors for more than two hours, Jean granted Harper's request and parliament was prorogued until January 26, 2009, with the Conservatives scheduled to announce the budget the following day. Near the end of her tenure as vicereine, Jean revealed to the Canadian Press that the two-hour delay in giving her decision was partly to [...] "send a message—and for people to understand that this warranted reflection." [...] She later stated in an interview on The Hour that [...] "I was in a position where I could <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>no...</b> And the decision had really to, in my mind, to be in the best interests, really, of the country, looking at all of the circumstances. And I have no regrets." ...|$|E

60|$|Philammon, not {{understanding}} {{the language in}} which he was addressed, could only shake his head--though if he had known what its import was, he could hardly in honesty <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> <b>No.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "Mr. Sowerby has betrayed him," [...] said Mrs. Robarts, {{wiping the}} tears from her eyes. Hitherto she <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>no</b> word against Sowerby, {{but now it was}} {{necessary}} to defend her husband.|$|R
6000|$|Kate was splendid, and {{it would}} have been clear for Milly now, had the further {{presumption}} been needed, that she <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>no</b> word to Mrs. Stringham. [...] "You mean you've been absurd?" ...|$|R
60|$|Jack looked up, with an impish {{expression}} of mischief in his eyes. A {{man with a}} modest opinion of himself would have taken warning, and would <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>no</b> more. The lawyer persisted.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>no</b> such thing. I am only {{resolved}} {{to act in}} that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to you, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If you {{had asked}} me when I first came here, I should <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>no.</b> I must say now - even at the hazard of {{appearing}} to make a pretence, and of justly awakening your incredulity - yes.' ...|$|E

60|$|Nigel <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>no</b> word {{since he}} had entered the room, but his look had never lost its set purpose, nor had his {{brooding}} eyes ever wandered from the sneering face of the deformed master of Shalford. Now he turned with swift decision to Mary and to the priest.|$|R
60|$|Trejago knew far {{too much}} about these things, as I <b>have</b> <b>said.</b> <b>No</b> Englishman {{should be able to}} {{translate}} object-letters. But Trejago spread all the trifles on the lid of his office-box and began to puzzle them out.|$|E

5000|$|Goldsmith {{claimed to}} have {{resigned}} in 2004 largely because {{he felt he had}} lost the confidence of administration leaders.
