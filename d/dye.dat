50|$|Cross <b>dyeing</b> is “a {{method of}} <b>dyeing</b> blend or {{combination}} fabrics {{to two or}} more shades {{by the use of}} <b>dyes</b> with different affinities for the different fibers”. The cross <b>dyeing</b> process can be used to create heather effects, and plaid, check, or striped fabrics. Cross <b>dyed</b> fabrics may be mistaken for fiber or yarn <b>dyed</b> materials as the fabric is not a solid color, a characteristic considered typical of piece <b>dyed</b> fabrics. It is not possible to visually differentiate between cross <b>dyed</b> fabrics and those <b>dyed</b> at the fiber or yarn stage.

5|$|Optical properties, {{including}} the PL efficiency, {{can be modified}} by encapsulating organic dyes (carotene, lycopene, etc.) inside the tubes. Efficient energy transfer occurs between the encapsulated <b>dye</b> and nanotube — light is efficiently absorbed by the <b>dye</b> and without significant loss is transferred to the SWCNT. Thus potentially, optical properties of a carbon nanotube can be controlled by encapsulating certain molecule inside it. Besides, encapsulation allows isolation and characterization of organic molecules which are unstable under ambient conditions. For example, Raman spectra are extremely difficult to measure from dyes because of their strong PL (efficiency close to 100%). However, encapsulation of <b>dye</b> molecules inside SWCNTs completely quenches <b>dye</b> PL, thus allowing measurement and analysis of their Raman spectra.|$|E
