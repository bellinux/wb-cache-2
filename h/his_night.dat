5|$|Islamic {{reverence for}} the site {{is derived from the}} belief that the prophet Mohammed tied his miraculous steed Buraq nearby during <b>his</b> <b>night</b> journey to Jerusalem. Various places have been {{suggested}} for the exact spot where Buraq was tethered, but for several centuries the preferred location has been the al-Buraq mosque, which is just inside the wall {{at the south end of}} the present Western Wall plaza. The mosque is located above an ancient passageway, which once came out through the long-sealed Barclay's Gate whose huge lintel is still visible directly below the Maghrebi gate.|$|E
5|$|Max {{leaves the}} house when Ray reappears and Tim accuses Ray of ruining <b>his</b> <b>night.</b> Lee and Ben {{make their way to}} the beach and share a kiss. Tim returns to the {{backyard}} and uncovers a ring and what appears to be a human hand before he decides to stop digging. He throws everything he has found back into the hole he has dug before starting to fill it in. He walks back up to the house and, finding Lee waiting for him, kisses her. The next morning, they pack up their belongings and go to pick up Jude.|$|E

5|$|Mulder {{contacts}} Frohike and Byers, who {{say that}} Fairfield {{is known for its}} animal disappearances and UFO sightings. They also mention Ambrose's gorilla, who is known to communicate using American Sign Language. Meanwhile, Scully follows one of Lang's activists as he sneaks into the zoo, running into Meecham inside. The activist attempts to free a tiger, but after a flash of light, the tiger seemingly disappears. The activist is promptly mauled to death, with the killing captured on <b>his</b> <b>night</b> vision camera. When questioned, Lang denies any responsibility for the death. Ambrose introduces the agents to the gorilla, Sophie, who has been cowering in her cage and expresses an apparent fear of light.|$|E
5|$|On 29 March 1949, Zaim {{launched}} a coup d'état, overthrowing Quwatli. Zaim's troops entered Damascus and raided Quwatli's home. They disarmed his guard and confronted Quwatli in <b>his</b> <b>night</b> clothes before army officer Ibrahim al-Husseini arrested him. After {{being allowed to}} change his clothes, Quwatli {{was taken by the}} authorities to the city's Mezzeh Prison. Prime Minister al-Azm was also arrested. The coup had been backed and allegedly co-planned with the US Central Intelligence Agency. The US was the first country to recognize Zaim's government, followed by the UK, France, and the Hashemite kingdoms of Iraq and Jordan.|$|E
5|$|On {{their return}} to Martlesham, Dowding {{outlined}} his concerns about night interceptions and {{the characteristics of a}} proper night fighter. Since the interceptions were long affairs, the aircraft needed to have long endurance. To ensure that friendly fire was not an issue, pilots would be required to identify all targets visually. This meant a separate radar operator would be needed, so the pilot would not lose <b>his</b> <b>night</b> vision by looking at the CRTs. And finally, since the time needed to arrange an interception was so long, the aircraft required armament that could guarantee destruction of a bomber in a single pass—there was little chance a second interception could be arranged.|$|E

5|$|In their mobility, Khalid's {{troops had}} no match until the Mongol hordes of the 13th century. In fact {{the tactics of}} the desert Arabs and steppe Mongols were {{somewhat}} identical. Entire troops of Khalid would ride on camels while on march, whereas the Mongols used horses, with the difference that the Arabs did not make use of mounted archers. His most commonly used maneuver was surprise attack, such as <b>his</b> <b>night</b> attacks from three different sides on Persian camps at Zumail, Muzayyah and Saniyy, his highly mobile army successfully maneuvering in a 100km area, quickly destroying encampments of the Persians and their Arab allies. The Battle of Maraj-al-Debaj being no exception, where once again his highly mobile army maneuvered around a Byzantine army, appearing from four directions and opening several fronts at a time, a maneuver which later in 13th century {{became one of the}} Mongol armies' principal maneuvers.|$|E
5|$|Taraki {{was born}} on 15 July 1917 to a Ghilzai Pashtun peasant family in Nawa District of Ghazni Province, Afghanistan. He was the oldest of three {{children}} and attended a village school in Nawa before leaving in 1932, {{at the age of}} 15, to work in the port city of Bombay, India. There he met a Kandahari merchant family who employed him as a clerk for the Pashtun Trading Company. Taraki's first encounter with communism was during <b>his</b> <b>night</b> courses, where he met several Communist Party of India members who impressed him with their discussions on social justice and communist values. Another important event was his encounter with Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, a Pashtun nationalist and leader of the Red Shirt Movement in neighboring India, who was an admirer of the works of Vladimir Lenin.|$|E
5|$|The first Pe-3s {{were issued}} to the 95th High-Speed Bomber Regiment in the Moscow Military District and the Regiment's {{experiences}} with the aircraft revealed other problems. Firing the guns at night dazzled the pilot and destroyed <b>his</b> <b>night</b> vision and the glare from searchlights through the glazing on the lower nose also blinded the pilot. Crews complained bitterly {{that the lack of}} frontal armor made them vulnerable to defensive fire from German bombers. Flash hiders installed on the guns and curtains covering the windows cured the first problems, but the lack of armor could not be rectified immediately. Many aircraft were also fitted with launchers for four to six RS-82 and RS-132 rockets for ground-attack missions. Another common addition was a launcher for DAG-10 aerial grenades mounted in the tail.|$|E

5|$|The {{inventor}} Nicéphore Niépce {{produced the}} first permanent photograph on a polished pewter plate in Paris in 1825, and then developed the process with Louis Daguerre. The work of Étienne-Jules Marey in the 1880s contributed considerably {{to the development}} of modern photography. Photography came to occupy a central role in Parisian Surrealist activity, in the works of Man Ray and Maurice Tabard. Numerous photographers achieved renown for their photography of Paris, including Eugène Atget, noted for his depictions of street scenes, Robert Doisneau, noted for his playful pictures of people and market scenes (among which Le baiser de l'hôtel de ville has become iconic of the romantic vision of Paris), Marcel Bovis, noted for <b>his</b> <b>night</b> scenes, and others such as Jacques-Henri Lartigue and Cartier-Bresson. Poster art also became an important art form in Paris in the late nineteenth century, through the work of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Jules Chéret, Eugène Grasset, Adolphe Willette, Pierre Bonnard, Georges de Feure, Henri-Gabriel Ibels, Gavarni, and Alphonse Mucha.|$|E

25|$|In a wider sense, he was {{influential}} in three respects. Firstly <b>his</b> <b>night</b> scenes were highly original. His lighting effects in general were very subtle, and {{very different from}} those of Caravaggio. He often uses as many as five different sources of light, and graduates the light relatively gently, with the less well-lit parts of the composition often containing important parts of it.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, after {{hosting a}} trailer for a BBC {{programme}} on VD on <b>his</b> <b>Night</b> Ride programme, Peel received significant media attention because he divulged on air {{that he had}} suffered from a sexually transmitted disease earlier that year. This admission was later used {{in an attempt to}} discredit him when he appeared as a defence witness in the 1971 Oz obscenity trial.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of the first {{production}} of Boris Godunov in February 1874, Mussorgsky had taken part in the ill-fated Mlada project (in the course of which he had made a choral version of <b>his</b> <b>Night</b> on Bald Mountain) and had begun Khovanshchina. Though far from being a critical success – and in spite of receiving only a dozen or so performances – the popular reaction in favour of Boris made this the peak of Mussorgsky's career.|$|E

The next morning Staphylus gives Dionysus splendid presents and encourages him to fight. While Dionysus is busy filling Assyria with his vine, Staphylus suddenly dies and his palace is filled with mourning voices. Dionysus returns to the palace only to find his friend dead.|$|E

No soundtrack was ever released, but the theme was released in two different versions: the original TV mix and edit appeared on TVT Records' compilation Television's Greatest Hits, Vol. 3: 70s & 80s, and Grusin recorded a full-length version for inclusion on <b>his</b> <b>Night</b> Lines album, released in 1983.|$|E
