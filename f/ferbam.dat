50|$|<b>Ferbam</b> is a fungicide.|$|E
50|$|People can {{be exposed}} to <b>ferbam</b> in the {{workplace}} by breathing it in, skin absorption, swallowing it, and eye contact. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for <b>ferbam</b> exposure in the workplace as 15 mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 1 mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 800 mg/m3, <b>ferbam</b> is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E
40|$|A simple, {{sensitive}} and rapid flame atomic absorption spectrometric (FAAS) method for the indirect determination of zinc ethylenebisdithiocarbamate (zineb) and ferric dimethyldithiocarbamate (<b>ferbam)</b> was described. Metals liberated upon decomposition of the fungicides {{were determined by}} FAAS and the zineb and <b>ferbam</b> content was calculated by using stoichiometric relationship between the metal and corresponding fungicide. The method was successfully applied {{to the analysis of}} water, tomato and wheat grain for the determination of zineb and <b>ferbam.</b> The fungicides were determined with relative standard deviation and relative error less than 5 %...|$|E
40|$|DNOC, <b>Ferbam</b> and Imidan {{were tested}} in (C 3 H X C 57 BL/ 6) F 1 mice to assess their {{potential}} testicular toxicity. Chemicals were administered i. p. and per os at different doses for 5 consecutive days. After 35 days the testicular was toxicity was evaluated by measuring the testicular weights, the sperm counts {{and the percentage of}} abnormal sperm. DNOC and Imidan failed to induce teratospermia in mice treated by both routes of administration. Conversely <b>Ferbam</b> induced a statistically significant increase in teratospermia only following per os administration to mice at a dose of 1000 mg/kg b. w. /day. These data indicate that per os administration of <b>Ferbam</b> succeeded in producing active metabolites able to interfere with the differentiation process of spermatogenic cells...|$|E
40|$|This report {{compares the}} antifertility {{activities}} in laying hens of various dithiocarbamates including the fungicides thiram, ziram, zineb, maneb and <b>ferbam,</b> and the alcohol deterrent anta-buse. Ziram at 200 ppm {{in the diet}} or thiram at 125 ppm stopped egg production within 2 days and caused marked ovarian atrophy after 7 days. <b>Ferbam</b> at levels between 200 and 600 ppm and antabuse at levels between 125 and 500 ppm reduced but did not eliminate egg production and caused only slight ovarian regression. In contrast, zineb and maneb were without effect when tested at 600 ppm. The antifertility effects of thiram were fully reversible, since hens treated with 250 ppm for either 10 or 14 days resumed egg production after treatment, and within 5 weeks exceeded their rate of production prior to treatment. Additionally {{it was found that}} daily injec-tions of porcine FSH could reverse the antigonadal effect of thiram, and a single injection of LIIRII could overcome its anovulatory effect. Reversal by LHRH suggests that thiram might block fertility by an action within the central nervous system...|$|E
40|$|Dithiocarbamates {{are widely}} used as {{fungicides}} because of their efficacy against {{a broad spectrum of}} fungi and their associated plant diseases. Dithiocarbamates are also used in industry as slimicides in water-cooling systems, in sugar, pulp, and paper manufacturing, and as vulcanization accelerators and antioxidants in rubber. Because of their chelating properties, they are also used as scavengers in waste-water treatment. Dithiocarbamates can be divided into two groups: the ethylenebisdithiocarbamates (EBDC), such as maneb, zineb, and mancozeb, and the dimethyldithiocarbamates (DMDC), including <b>ferbam,</b> ziram, and thiram...|$|E
40|$|Two ladybeetles, Cycloneda sanguinea and Harmonia axyridis, {{were exposed}} in the {{laboratory}} to eight fungicide formulations commonly used in citrus production in Florida. Both benomyl and the combination of copper and petroleum oil proved toxic to larvae of C. sanguinea that were exposed to concentrations corresponding to recommended field rates, either as leaf residues or in topical spray applications. Larvae of C. sanguinea also suffered significant mortality when exposed to neem oil as a leaf residue, but not after topical application. Larvae of H. axyridis exposed to these compounds completed development with the same success as control larvae in all trials. However, H. axyridis larvae exhibited slower development following exposure to leaf residues of <b>ferbam</b> applied at twice the recommended rate. Exposure to azoxystrobin as a leaf residue at twice the recommended concentration resulted in accelerated larval development in both species. No compounds appeared repellent to adult beetles of either species. Adult beetles of both species were observed resting on portions of filter paper treated with fosetyl-Al more often than on untreated, control portions. Azoxystrobin, <b>ferbam</b> and mefenoxam similarly arrested the movement of adult C. sanguinea, whereas benomyl and the copper and petroleum oil combination arrested the movement of adult H. axyridis. The differential sensitivity of the two coccinellid species is discussed {{in the context of}} the potential displacement of the indigenous C. sanguinea by the invasive H. axyridis...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work {{was to develop a}} {{reliable}} method for the micro determination of dithiocarbamates (Mancozeb, Maneb, Propineb, Nabam, Na(CH 3) 2 DTC, Zineb, Ziram, <b>Ferbam</b> and Thiram) in pesticide formulations for agriculture using adsorptive stripping voltammetry (AdSV). The accuracy of analytical method was valued by analyzing simulates formulation samples prepared by us with known amounts of active ingredients. In addition, the applicability of the AdSV procedure for the analysis of DTCs and EBDTCs in micro samples was evaluated by estimating its recoveries from spiked commercial formulate samples. The accuracy, valuated as recovery percentage ranged between 85...|$|E
40|$|During 1962. {{efficiency}} {{tests of}} some fungicides against Peronospora tabacina Adam {{were carried out}} by tbe Institute for Plant Protection of Zagreb {{in cooperation with the}} Institute of Tobacco in Mostar Tests were carried out in hot-houses, sprout-beds and in fields. Besides these efficiency tests the toxicity of these fungicides was also examined. Their chemical bases were: zineb, maneb, <b>ferbam,</b> ziram and tiram as well as some new preparations still under a chiffre. Zineb based preparations with 65 % a. t. in suspension formulation save very good resglts without any phytotoxicity in 0, 3 % concentrations. Zineb based powders with 7, 5 - 10 % a. t. give good, results if 4 - 5 grammes a square metre are applied. Maneb based powders with 7 - 15 % a. t. cause a slight phytotoxicity in tobacco plantations if 3 - 4 grammes/m² are applied. However, if applied in dosages of higher quantities, they produce severe phytotoxicity in tobacco plantatioins. Maneb based sprayings with 65 % a. t. in 0, 05 - 0, 06 % concentrations produced mild phytotoxicities of a passing character. Both formulation had a very high percentage of efficiency. <b>Ferbam</b> based preparations in 0, 3 - 0, 4 % concentrations proved to be very suitable for safeguarding tobacco plantations by creating a very good protection without any phytotoxicity. Tiram based preparations protected well with the 0, 4 % concentration. Tiram based preparations in 0, 2 - 0, 4 % concentrations failed to create protection against tobacco peronospora in plantations...|$|E
40|$|The toxicities of six dithiocarbamates: bis(dimethyl thiocarbamoyl) {{disulfide}} (thiram), zinc dimethyldithiocarbamate (ziram), ferric dimethyldithiocarbamate (<b>ferbam),</b> bis(dimethyl thiocarbamoyl) ethylene bis(dithiocarbamate) (triaram), sodium diethyl dithiocarbamate (NaDEDC), {{and sodium}} ethylene bis(dithiocarbamate) (nabam) were determined in the chick embryo. The substances were dissolved in propylene glycol and injected {{in the air}} chamber prior to incubation. Injection in the yolk sac on any day of development or in the air chamber after the first day was unsuitable {{for the assessment of}} an LD 50. With the exception of nabam, the dithiocarbamates were extremely toxic for the early chick embryo. Cysteine injected simultaneously in the air chamber protected the embryos from the toxic effect of thiram or ziram but not from the action of triaram. It is suggested that the former two dithiocarbamates are reduced by cysteine to less toxic compounds...|$|E
40|$|A {{derivative}} spectrophotometric {{procedure was}} developed for the determination of zinc(II) ethylenebisdithiocarbamate, Zineb, after formation of its blue colored complex with sodium molybdate in acidic medium. The Beer's law is obeyed up to 40 µg mL- 1 of Zineb at 956 nm. The detection limit was 0. 006 µg mL- 1 for Zineb when S/N ratio is 3 taking into account various parameters, such as the effect of acid concentration. The interference {{of a large number}} of ions on the determination of Zineb was evaluated. Most of the alkaline metals and metal salts did not interfere. The procedure presented proper sensitivity and it was applied for determining Zineb in food stuffs and commercial samples of Dithane Z 78 and Hexathane 75 % W. P [...] Results were compared with earlier reported methods. Zineb was successfully determined without any interferences in the presence of other dithiocarbamates like ziram, thiram, <b>ferbam</b> etc...|$|E
40|$|The {{fungicide}} Maneb, applied {{seven times}} during the growing season, was significantly more effective than four other fungicides in controlling white pine foliage disease during the 1973 growing season at the Piedmont Forest Tree Nursery near Salem, S. C. Other fungicides tested at the same application rate were Daconil, Topsin M, <b>Ferbam</b> and Bordeaux mixture. Although Maneb was the most effective of the five treatments tested, it did not give the degree of control required by most nurserymen. Computed disease ratings for the other four materials tested {{were not significantly different}} from the computed disease ratings for non-treated seedlings in the sampled isolation strips. Heavy rainfall during the 30 -day period prior to initiation of disease symptoms undoubtedly contributed to significantly increased disease spread and severity. Therefore, more frequent fungicide applications may be required during periods of excessive rainfall to adequately control the disease...|$|E
40|$|Alternaria brown spot, {{caused by}} Alternaria alternata, causes yield losses and fruit {{blemishes}} on many tangerines and their hybrids in most citrus {{areas of the}} world where susceptible cultivars are grown. Although the conditions affecting infection and disease severity are known, little information is available on inoculum production on infected tissue. We found that sporulation on leaves began about 10 days after symptoms developed, was abundant from 20 to 40 days, and declined thereafter. Conidial production was far greater on leaf than on fruit or twig lesions. Spore production per unit area of leaf lesion was greater on the more susceptible hybrids, Minneola and Orlando tangelos, than on the less susceptible Murcott tangor. At 74 % relative humidity, conidial production on leaf lesions was low, but it was abundant at 85, 92. 5, 96, and 100 %. Application of Q(o) I or copper fungicides, but not <b>ferbam,</b> suppressed sporulation on leaf lesions for about 14 to 21 days after application. Additional applications {{did not appear to be}} more effective than a single spray in reducing inoculum production...|$|E
40|$|Eight of 24 female rats fed 66. 9 mg/kg-day of thiram {{developed}} neurotoxicity. The neurotoxic {{effects were}} characterized by ataxia and paralysis of the hind legs. There were demyelination, degeneration of the axis cylinders, and presence of macrophages in the nerve bundle of the sciatic nerve. Degeneration in the ventral horn of the lower lumbar region of the spinal cord was evidenced by chromatolysis of motorneurons, pyknosis, and satellitosis. During a second experiment, 4 of 24 females fed 65. 8 mg/kg [...] day also developed ataxia and paralysis. An additional 9 females showed clasping of the hind feet when {{picked up by the}} tail. Nerve conduction could not be measured for one severely ataxic rat and the electromyogram indicated a loss of motor unit function. Histopathology of this rat, along with the others, suggests the peripheral nerve as the primary site of the lesion. Thiram also caused behavioral changes in apparently normal rats. The walking pattern of the hind legs was altered with decreases in stride width and the angle between contralateral steps. These rats required significantly more shock-motivations and cleared a lower height in a jump/climb ability test. An open-field study indicated that thiram caused hyperactivity in the nonataxic rats of both sexes. Three of 24 rats fed 95. 8 mg/kg-day of <b>ferbam</b> also developed ataxia or paralysis...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{enhanced}} Raman spectroscopy (SERS) {{has been}} widely applied for rapid and sensitive detection of various chemical and biological targets. Here, we incorporated a syringe filter system into the SERS method to detect pesticides, protein toxins and bacteria in water. For the detection of chemical and protein targets, silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were aggregated by sodium chloride (NaCl) to form nanoclusters that could be trapped in the pores of the filter membrane to from the SERS-active membrane. Then a coating of capture (e. g. aptamer) was integrated on the nanoparticle substrate if needed. Then samples were filtered through the membrane. After capturing the target, the membrane was taken out and air dried before measuring by a Raman instrument. The developed filter SERS method was able to detect fungicide <b>ferbam</b> as low as 2. 5 ppb level and had a good quantitative capability, which could also be carried out on site using a portable Raman instrument. The aptamer integrated filter SERS was able to detect ricin b chain in water at 100 ppb level. The filter membrane was then applied to detect bacteria E. Coli with the integration of 4 -mpba as a capture and indicator. With SERS mapping, we can detect E. Coli down to 101 CFU/ml and the viability of bacteria on the membrane could be confirmed by incubating the membrane on TS agar down to 102 CFU/ml. This study shows the filter based SERS methods improve the detection capability in water samples, with a great versatility for various types of assays...|$|E
