DATA SOURCES: The literature on <b>health</b> <b>plan</b> competition was reviewed. Possible data sources to study <b>health</b> <b>plan</b> competition were evaluated. Experts {{in the field of}} <b>health</b> <b>plan</b> competition were contacted about their knowledge of existing data sources. Principal Findings. There is much more quantitative data available on HMO plans than on other types of <b>health</b> <b>plans</b> that are growing in popularity, such as PPOs. A key source for <b>health</b> <b>plan</b> data, state <b>health</b> insurance filings, lacks information on beneficiaries in non-HMO <b>plans.</b> Data on <b>health</b> <b>plan</b> quality is growing. In addition, case studies of particular markets is providing useful qualitative information on the dynamics of the <b>health</b> <b>plan</b> industry. CONCLUSIONS: The fragmentation of the health care market and the hesitancy of governments and private organizations to provide detailed information across markets and providers creates serious obstacles to the study of <b>health</b> <b>plan</b> competition...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Many {{countries}} have introduced elements of managed competition in their healthcare {{system with the}} aim to accomplish more efficient and demand-driven health care. Simultaneously, generating and reporting of comparative healthcare information has become an important quality-improvement instrument. We examined whether the introduction of managed competition in the Dutch healthcare system along with public reporting of quality information was associated with performance improvement in <b>health</b> <b>plans.</b> Methods Experiences of consumers with their <b>health</b> <b>plan</b> were measured in four consecutive years (2005 - 2008) using the CQI Â® <b>health</b> <b>plan</b> instrument 'Experiences with Healthcare and Health Insurer'. Data were available of 13, 819 respondents (response = 45 %) of 30 <b>health</b> <b>plans</b> in 2005, of 8, 266 respondents (response = 39 %) of 32 <b>health</b> <b>plans</b> in 2006, of 8, 088 respondents (response = 34 %) of 32 <b>health</b> <b>plans</b> in 2007, and of 7, 183 respondents (response = 31 %) of 32 <b>health</b> <b>plans</b> in 2008. We performed multilevel regression analyses with three levels: respondent, <b>health</b> <b>plan</b> and year of measurement. Per year and per quality aspect, we estimated <b>health</b> <b>plan</b> means while adjusting for consumers' age, education and self-reported health status. We tested for linear and quadratic time effects using chi-squares. Results The overall performance of <b>health</b> <b>plans</b> increased significantly from 2005 to 2008 on four quality aspects. For three other aspects, {{we found that the}} overall performance first declined and then increased from 2006 to 2008, but the performance in 2008 was not better than in 2005. The overall performance of <b>health</b> <b>plans</b> did not improve more often for quality aspects that were identified as important areas of improvement {{in the first year of}} measurement. On six out of seven aspects, the performance of <b>health</b> <b>plans</b> that scored below average in 2005 increased more than the performance of <b>health</b> <b>plans</b> that scored average and/or above average in that year. Conclusion We found mixed results concerning the effects of managed competition on the performance of <b>health</b> <b>plans.</b> To determine whether managed competition in the healthcare system leads to quality improvement in <b>health</b> <b>plans,</b> it is important to examine whether and for what reasons <b>health</b> <b>plans</b> initiate improvement efforts. </p...|$|R
