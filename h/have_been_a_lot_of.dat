ITmedia Gamez noted that players should be attentive to all the details in the story as the twists will surprise the player in many different ways. It was also suggested to the player that the characters' voices be left turned on as the voice acting is very good. The review did caution that players who have played through the demo and who did not enjoy the atmosphere of the game were not likely to find the rest of the game interesting. Steins;Gate has also been praised by Square Enix producer Tomoya Asano, who described it as having [...] "appealing and likable characters and a scenario that surprised players"; this led to Steins;Gate writer Naotaka Hayashi writing the plot and characters for the role-playing video game [...] In 2011, Steins;Gate was voted #6 in Famitsus poll of [...] "most tear-inducing games" [...] of all time.|$|E
500|$|Bryan Singer {{first read}} Apt Pupil {{when he was}} 19 years old, and {{when he became a}} director, he wanted to adapt the novella into a film. In 1995, Singer asked his friend and screenwriter Brandon Boyce to write a spec script {{adapting}} the novella. [...] Boyce recalled the writing process, [...] "I {{thought it was a great}} stageplay, actually... two people, pretty much in a house talking. [...] My script was completely on spec, so, if it didn't work out, at least I'd have a writing sample." [...] When the original option to the novella expired in 1995, Stephen King sued to get the rights back. Singer and Boyce then provided to King a first draft of their script and a copy of Singer's film The Usual Suspects (1995), which had yet to be publicly released. Impressed with Singer, King optioned the rights to the director for $1, arranging to be compensated when the film was released. Singer said of King's ultimate response to the film, despite some changes made to the source material, [...] "Stephen loved it. He seemed to think I captured the mood of the piece." [...] The director appreciated being able to make a Stephen King horror film but with less supernatural terror and more character-driven terror. Singer spoke of his goal: [...] "There <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> fun horror movies like Nightmare on Elm Street and Scream, and I Know What You Did Last Summer. But I miss movies like The Shining, The Exorcist, and The Innocents by Jack Clayton, so this is a movie sort of in the spirit of the real horror movie." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{film has}} also been {{described}} as pro-choice because of its portrayal of abortion.

[...] Several critics praised the film's balanced treatment of abortion: Ty Burr of The Boston Globe wrote that it was [...] "neither minimized nor built up into a Major Statement", while the Financial Times Danny Leigh appreciated that [...] "the sad gravity of the premise is not underplayed". The Independent critic Geoffrey McNab found it [...] "heartening to see a film that tackles unintended pregnancy and abortion in a humorous and sensitive way".|$|E

2500|$|After facing intense {{international}} {{reaction and}} promises from Western nations to cut {{financial aid to}} Uganda, Uganda's Minister [...] Buturo said on 9 December 2009 that Uganda will revise the bill to drop {{the death penalty and}} substitute life imprisonment for gay people with multiple offences. Initially, however, Buturo stated that the government was determined to pass the bill [...] "even if meant withdrawing from international treaties and conventions such as the UN's Universal Declaration on Human Rights, and forgoing donor funding", according to an interview in The Guardian. Bahati, the bill's sponsor, subsequently and repeatedly denied those reports. On 23 December, however, Reuters reported that Buturo again said that the death penalty would be dropped from the bill. He claimed, however, that protests from western nations did not affect this decision. He stated, [...] "There <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> discussions in government ... regarding the proposed law, but we now think a life sentence could be better because it gives room for offenders to be rehabilitated.

2500|$|Originally, the {{developers}} {{had intended to}} do a straight adaptation of the film. However, they quickly concluded that doing so presented two inherent problems; the original screenplay was so good, they felt it couldn't be replicated in a gaming environment, and because Montana dies at the end, they felt players {{would not want to}} invest in developing a character that they knew was doomed from the beginning. As such, they decided the game would tell an original story, set after the film. Jason Bone, combat designer on the game, explained [...] "We didn't want to rehash the movie because we feel that to make a good game, {{there needs to be a}} compelling storyline with good characters that drive you through it. There <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> games that have been made based on movies, and when they follow the exact storyline of the movie, you lose a little bit of interest if you know where things are going. We felt that a fresh start would allow us to have the freedom to do new and interesting things to keep the player motivated and engaged." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{appearing}} as oil tycoon Adam Steiffel in 1980's The Formula, which was poorly received critically, Brando {{announced his retirement}} from acting. However, he returned in 1989 in A Dry White Season, based on André Brink's 1979 anti-apartheid novel. Brando agreed to do the film for free, but fell out with director Euzhan Palcy over how the film was edited; he even made a rare television appearance {{in an interview with}} Connie Chung to voice his disapproval. In his memoir, he maintained that Palcy [...] "had cut the picture so poorly, I thought, that the inherent drama of this conflict was vague at best." [...] Brando received praise for his performance, earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor and winning the Best Actor Award at the Tokyo Film Festival. Brando also scored enthusiastic reviews for his caricature of his Vito Corleone role as Carmine Sabatini in 1990's The Freshman. In his original review, Roger Ebert wrote, [...] "There <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> movies where stars have repeated the triumphs of their parts—but has any star ever done it more triumphantly than Marlon Brando does in The Freshman?" [...] Variety also praised Brando's performance as Sabatini and noted, [...] "Marlon Brando's sublime comedy performance elevates The Freshman from screwball comedy to a quirky niche in film history." [...] Brando also starred alongside his friend Johnny Depp in the box office hit Don Juan DeMarco (1995) and in Depp's controversial The Brave (1997), which was never released in the United States. Later performances, such as his appearance in [...] (1992) (for which he won a Raspberry as [...] "Worst Supporting Actor"), The Island of Dr. Moreau (in which he was nominated for another [...] "Worst Actor" [...] Raspberry) (1996), and his barely recognizable appearance in Free Money (1998), resulted in some of the worst reviews of his career. However, his last completed film, The Score (2001), was received generally positively. In the film, in which he portrays a fence, he starred with Robert De Niro, who had portrayed Vito Corleone in The Godfather Part II.|$|E

Even then we did not talk much to other people about them, for there would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> talk, and inquiry, and questions, and you know fellows hate that sort of thing.

[...] "All {{the country as}} far as that was {{declared}} to be forfeited; but in point of fact the Kaffirs remained in possession of their lands on condition that they declared their allegiance to the Crown, and that each chief was made responsible for any cattle or other robberies, the spoor of which could be traced to his kraal. Of course they agreed to this, as, in fact, they would agree to anything, resolving, naturally, to break the conditions as soon as it suited them. Local magistrates and commissioners are scattered about among them, and there <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> schools and missionary stations started. They say that they are having great success. Well, we shall see about that. In the last war the so-called Christian natives {{were among the first to}} turn against us, and I expect it will be the same here, for it's just the laziest and worst of the natives who pretend to become Christians. They get patches of land given them, and help in building their huts, and all sorts of privileges. By about half-a-day's work each week they can raise enough food to live upon, and all that is really required of them is to attend services on a Sunday. The business exactly suits them, but as a rule there are a great many more Hottentots than Kaffirs among the converts. I can give you a specimen of the sort of men they are. Not long since a gentleman was coming down with a waggon and a lot of bullocks from King Williamstown. The drivers all took it into their head to desert one day--it's a way these fellows have, one of them thinks he will go, and then the whole lot go, and a settler wakes up in the morning and finds that there isn't a single hand left on his place, and he has perhaps four or five hundred cows to be milked, and twice as many oxen and horses to look after. Well, this happened within a mile or so of the missionary station, so the gentleman rode over there and asked if some of the men would go with him down to Beaufort, a couple of days' march. Nobody would go; he raised his offers, and at last offered five times the usual rate of pay, but not one of the lazy brutes would move, and he had at last to drive the whole lot down himself, with the aid of a native or two he picked up on the way. However, there has been pretty good order along the frontier for the last two years, partly due to the chiefs having to pay for all cattle traced to their kraals, partly to the fact that we have got four hundred Kaffir police--and an uncommon smart lot of fellows they are--scattered all along the frontier, instead of being, like us, kept principally in towns. You see, we are considered more as a military body. Of course, we have a much easier time of it than if we were knocking about in small parties among the border settlements; but there is a lot more excitement in that sort of life, and I hope that if there is trouble they will send us out to protect the settlements." ...|$|E
