25|$|When {{the patient}} is {{unsatisfied}} with {{the outcome of the}} augmentation mammoplasty; or when technical or medical complications occur; or because of the breast implants’ limited product life, it is likely she might require replacing the breast implants. Common revision surgery indications include major and minor medical complications, capsular contracture, shell rupture, and device deflation. Revision incidence rates were greater for breast reconstruction patients, because of the post-mastectomy changes to the soft-tissues and to the skin envelope of the breast, and to the anatomical borders of the breast, especially in women who received adjuvant <b>external</b> <b>radiation</b> therapy. Moreover, besides breast reconstruction, breast cancer patients usually undergo revision surgery of the nipple-areola complex (NAC), and symmetry procedures upon the opposite breast, to create a bust of natural appearance, size, form, and feel. Carefully matching the type and size of the breast implants to the patient’s pectoral soft-tissue characteristics reduces the incidence of revision surgery. Appropriate tissue matching, implant selection, and proper implantation technique, the re-operation rate was 3.0 per cent at the 7-year-mark, compared with the re-operation rate of 20 per cent at the 3-year-mark, as reported by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.|$|E

40|$|Objectives The {{utility of}} {{adjuvant}} <b>external</b> beam <b>radiation</b> therapy after surgery for pancreatic adenocarcinoma remains controversial. Our {{aim was to}} identify subsets of patients who may benefit from adjuvant <b>external</b> beam <b>radiation</b> therapy. Methods 6114 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with oncologic surgery between 2004 and 2010 were extracted from the SEER database. Demographic and treatment information was obtained for these patients, including whether or not patients received adjuvant <b>external</b> beam <b>radiation</b> therapy. A Cox multivariable analysis was performed to provide an adjusted hazard ratio of dying from pancreatic cancer. Results The adjusted hazard ratio of dying from pancreatic cancer favored the adjuvant <b>external</b> beam <b>radiation</b> therapy arm (HRDPC= 0. 75, 95 % CI 0. 70 - 0. 79, p< 0. 0001). Unfortunately, {{it was not possible}} to elucidate subsets of patients who may or may not share the benefit of adjuvant <b>external</b> beam <b>radiation</b> therapy based on prognostic factors or treatment approaches. Interestingly, the hazard ratio of dying from pancreatic cancer for the overall population was statistically significantly improved in 2009 and 2010 as compared to 2004. The hazard ratio of dying from pancreatic cancer did not significantly improve in the adjuvant <b>external</b> beam <b>radiation</b> therapy population with time.

Fukushima has also highlighted earlier research showing a much greater risk of radiation-induced cancer for women and children. [...] The women say the government should evacuate children from areas with consistently elevated radiation levels. Hundreds of women, from Fukushima and elsewhere, organized a sit-in protest at the Ministry of Economy headquarters from October 30-November 5. Women have helped to follow through on the September 19 Tokyo protest that where 60,000 marched. Some women have long participated in protest against the Fukushima TEPCO nuclear plants and there are also many newcomers. Now, in the wake of March 11, 2011, they are airing their views nationwide.

The <b>external</b> electromagnetic <b>radiation</b> of Lévy noise leads to the mode transition of the electrical activities and spatial phase, such as from the rest state to the firing state, from the spiking state to the spiking state with more spikes, and from the spiking state to the bursting state.

Also the stationary probability distribution functions of the membrane potential of the neuron induced by the <b>external</b> electromagnetic <b>radiation</b> of Lévy noise with different intensity, stability index and skewness papremeters are analyzed. Moreover, through the positive largest Lyapunov exponent, the parameter regions of chaotic electrical mode of the neuron induced by the <b>external</b> electromagnetic <b>radiation</b> of Lévy noise distribution are detected...|$|R
