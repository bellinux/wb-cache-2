40|$|Background: The theta <b>activity</b> from <b>frontal</b> {{electrodes}} in electroencephalography (EEG) {{is discussed}} to originate from the anterior cingulate cortex, an important brain area for executive functions and {{the processing of}} sensory information. Several EEG-studies have linked higher <b>frontal</b> theta <b>activity</b> to more focused attention and superior performance in goal directed precision tasks. Purpose: The primary {{purpose of this study}} was to compare <b>frontal</b> theta <b>activity</b> between biathletes and cross-country skiers during shooting, thereby comparing <b>frontal</b> theta <b>activity</b> between experts and novices. The secondary purpose was to examine the effects of vigorous exercise on the possible differences in <b>frontal</b> theta <b>activity</b> between the groups. Methods: EEG frontal theta (4. 01 - 6. 2 Hertz) activity was compared between nine biathletes and eight cross-country skiers who fired 100 shots on a 5 m indoor shooting range both before and after high intensity roller skiing intervals on a treadmill. Results: There was a highly significant group difference in performance in both conditions (p < 0. 01). Biathletes had on average 6 % higher <b>frontal</b> theta <b>activity</b> during shooting as compared to cross-country skiers (F 1, 15 = 4. 82, p = 0. 044), but no significant effect of vigorous exercise on <b>frontal</b> theta <b>activity</b> in either of the two groups were found (F 1, 15 = 0. 14, p = 0. 72).

50|$|The ways {{in which}} memory changes over the adult {{lifespan}} is also a source for Craik’s latest research. In this case, age is looked at as a factor that alters and degrades memory efficiency and abilities over time.

However, verbal or visual stimuli can be recognized {{at the same level}} of efficiency {{over the course of a}} lifetime. Craik and his colleagues found physiological evidence for this cognitive degradation through their research into the brains of elderly participants. Specifically, they discovered that there is a reduction in <b>frontal</b> <b>activity.</b> Still, there is an increased level of activity in the left prefrontal cortex when older adults undergo some nonverbal tasks of retrieval when compared to younger individuals. Moreover, the presence of increased left prefrontal cortex activity is only found in tasks revolving retrieval but there is still a reduction when performing encoding tasks.|$|E

[...] Positron emission tomography (PET) was utilized to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) in musicians possessing AP and musicians lacking AP.

In total 17 ADHD boys and 17 matched controls were recruited to undergo rfMRI scan on a 3. 0 T MRI system.

Functional images were processed in AFNI for calculation of ALFF and then group comparison was performed using voxel-based t-test. With a corrected threshold of p < 0. 05 determined by AlphaSim, we found that in comparison with controls, ADHD patients demonstrated higher ALFF values in the left superior frontal gyrus and sensorimotor cortex (SMC), and lower ALFF values in the bilateral anterior, middle cingulate and the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG). Significant correlations were found between patients' WSCT measures and the peak ALFF located in the right MFG (r = 0. 69, p = 0. 02), and the left SMC (r = 0. 65, p = 0. 03).

The present study aimed at examining whether frontal theta activity—an electrophysiological measure of rACC activity—could be a reliable EEG correlate of mood-related emotional processing in individuals with dysphoria. To this end, the EEG was recorded in 27 individuals with dysphoria and 29 individuals without dysphoria during an emotional imagery task, including pleasant, neutral and unpleasant scripts. Self-reported valence, arousal and vividness, and changes in <b>frontal</b> theta <b>activity</b> were measured during the task. <b>Frontal</b> theta <b>activity</b> was more reduced from baseline to the imagery of pleasant relative to unpleasant scripts in the group with dysphoria, whereas the opposite pattern of reduction was noted in the group without dysphoria.

No differences between groups in subjective ratings were noted. Consistent with the key role of rACC activity in depressionrelated emotional dysregulation, these findings suggest that <b>frontal</b> theta <b>activity</b> may be an EEG correlate of moodrelated emotional processing in dysphoria.

40|$|Seasonal thermal fronts {{associated}} with wind-driven coastal downwelling/upwelling {{in the northern}} South China Sea are investigated using satellite measurements and three repeated fine-resolution mapping surveys in winter, spring, and summer. The results show that vigorous thermal fronts develop over the broad shelf with variable widths and intensities in different seasons, {{which tend to be}} approximately aligned with the 20 - 100 m isobaths. Driven by the prevailing winter/summer monsoon, the band-shaped fronts were observed with a magnitude exceeding 0. 1 degrees C/km in the subsurface, and accompanied by energetic coastal downwelling/upwelling due to shoreward/offshore Ekman transport. The downward/upward tilting of seasonal thermoclines across the shelf exceeds 20 m, significantly contributing to the development of thermal fronts over the shelf. In addition, the diagnostic analysis of Potential Vorticity (PV) suggests that the summer <b>frontal</b> <b>activities</b> induced by the coastal upwelling are more stable to convection and symmetric instabilities in comparison to the winter fronts {{associated with}} downwelling-favorable monsoon forcing. This is primarily due to their essential differences in the upper ocean stratification and horizontal buoyancy gradients arising from wind forcing.

40|$|The {{hopelessness}} {{theory of}} depression proposes {{that individuals with}} a depressogenic cognitive style {{are more likely to}} become hopeless and experience depression following negative life events. Although the neurophysiological underpinnings of cognitive style remain speculative, research indicates that decreased relative left <b>frontal</b> brain electrical <b>activity</b> holds promise as a traitlike marker of depression. This begs the question: Do measures of depressogenic cognitive style and resting frontal brain asymmetry index a common vulnerability? The present study provides preliminary support for this hypothesis. At baseline assessment, increased cognitive vulnerability to depression was associated with decreased relative left <b>frontal</b> brain <b>activity</b> at rest in individuals with no prior history of, or current, depression. Following baseline assessment, participants were followed prospectively an average of 3 years with structured diagnostic interviews at 4 -month intervals. Both cognitive vulnerability and asymmetric <b>frontal</b> cortical <b>activity</b> prospectively predicted onset of first depressive episode in separate univariate analyses. Fur-thermore, multivariate analyses indicated that cognitive vulnerability and frontal asymmetry represente...|$|R
