5|$|Manuscripts 1eap and 1rK Erasmus {{borrowed}} from Johannes Reuchlin. The {{rest of the}} manuscripts he {{borrowed from}} Dominicans. It is significant {{that he did not}} use the Codex Basilensis, which was held at the Basel University Library, and was available for him. Erasmus had three manuscripts of the Gospels and Acts, four manuscripts of the Pauline epistles, but only one manuscript with the Book of Revelation. In every book of the New Testament he compared three or four manuscripts, except the last book, Book of Revelation. Unfortunately, this manuscript was not complete, it lacked the final leaf, which contained the last six verses of the book. Instead of delaying the publication, on account of the search for another manuscript, he decided to translate the missing verses from the Latin Vulgate into Greek. He used an inferior manuscript of Vulgate with textual variant libro vitae (book of life) instead ligno vitae (tree of life) in Rev 22:19. Even {{in other parts of the}} Book of Revelation and other books of the New Testament Erasmus occasionally introduced self-created Greek text material taken from the Vulgate. F. H. A. Scrivener remarked, that in Rev 17:4 he created a new Greek word: ἀκαθαρτητος (instead τὰ ἀκάθαρτα). There is no such word in Greek language as ακαθαρτητος. In Rev 17:8 he used καιπερ εστιν (and yet is) instead of και παρεσται (and shall come). In Acts 9:6 the question that Paul asks at the time of his conversion on the Damascus road, Τρέμων τε καὶ θαμβὣν εἲπεν κύριε τί μέ θέλεις ποιῆσαι ("And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what will you <b>have</b> <b>me</b> to do?") was incorporated from the Vulgate.|$|E

500|$|Veronica Mars was one {{of roughly}} five series being {{considered}} for cancellation by the network in 2007. At The CW's upfront conference, critic Michael Ausiello asked Ostroff {{about the fate of}} the show. She responded that Thomas and Bell could work together on another show for the network, but she thought that this possibility was unlikely. She said that [...] "it could come back in some form, but I don't know what form that would be". Thomas responded, [...] "I assume that anything Dawn would be talking about in the realm of a Rob–Kristen project would involve a new from-scratch pilot as they don't <b>have</b> <b>me</b> in a deal, and they'll lose Kristen in a couple of weeks." ...|$|E
500|$|In Moonwalk (1988), Jackson {{said his}} {{relationship}} with Shields was [...] "romantically serious for a while." [...] Shields said that while never formally proposing, he would speak about the two marrying and raising adoptive children together. The suggestions were met with disapproval from Shields, who felt {{such a move would}} have [...] "divided [...] life too much". She recalled: [...] "There were times when he would ask me to marry him, and I would say, 'You <b>have</b> <b>me</b> {{for the rest of your}} life, you don’t need to marry me, I’m going to go on...have my own marriage and my own kids, and you’ll always have me.' I think it made him relax. He didn’t want to lose things that meant something to him." ...|$|E
500|$|On 4 October 2006, it was {{announced}} that actress Nadine Lewington had been cast in the role of Maddy. Lewington had made a previous appearance in series 20, episode 22 of Holby City sister show Casualty. Lewington recalls of her role: [...] "I was a young married mum of one with another on the way. I loved my little bump. My reckless hubbie had had a motorbike accident, in which a baby was injured, after promising to give the bikes up. I threatened to leave him, Charlie Fairhead gave him what for and told him how lucky he was to <b>have</b> <b>me</b> and he promised to be model father after all. Happily ever after. It was a really sweet little story actually. Very touching".|$|E

500|$|During the {{production}} of X2, producer Lauren Shuler Donner had discussed {{the idea of a}} film focusing on the young X-Men with the crew, which was met with approval; the concept was revived during {{the production}} of [...] One of The Last Stands writers, Zak Penn, was hired to write and direct this spin-off, but this idea later fell through. Penn explained in 2007 that [...] "the original idea was to <b>have</b> <b>me</b> do a young X-Men spin-off, a spin-off of the young X-Men characters. But someone came up with a pretty interesting idea [...] it was this guy who worked with me named Mike Chamoy, he worked a lot with me on X3. He came up with how to do a young X-Men movie which is not what you'd expect." ...|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from being}} Carey's second highest {{worldwide}} seller, Daydream served as her most personal and directly influenced album at the time. During the album's recording, Carey grew as an artist, {{as well as}} a writer. For {{the first time in her}} career, Carey was able to make music that she truly related to, R and hip hop. While Columbia allowed Carey more leniency with the music she recorded, they became hesitant when she featured Ol' Dirty Bastard in the remix for [...] "Fantasy". They feared the sudden change was completely left field for her music, and worried it would jeopardize the album's success. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Carey openly spoke of her issues with Columbia: [...] "Everybody was like 'What, are you crazy?' They're nervous about breaking the formula. It works to <b>have</b> <b>me</b> sing a ballad on stage in a long dress with my hair up." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2010, it was {{announced}} that actor Matt Damon would guest star on 30 Rock. He made his debut in the fourth season finale episode [...] "I Do Do" [...] as Carol, an airline pilot and love interest for Fey's character, Liz Lemon, and reprised the role in [...] "The Fabian Strategy". In December 2009, prior to the confirmation of his first guest appearance, Entertainment Weekly informed Damon that he {{was at the top of}} Fey's guest star wish list for the show. A fan of the series, Damon replied [...] "I would do [...] in a heartbeat if they asked me to come on. She should call my people—or even better me. Or I could call her. Let's make this happen." [...] A day after the airing of [...] "I Do Do" [...] he was asked if he would reprise his role as Carol in the upcoming season and responded [...] "If they'll <b>have</b> <b>me,</b> I would love to pop in and see the gang again. I had a great time doing it." [...] In August 2010, Fey confirmed Damon's return saying that he would play her boyfriend once the new season began.|$|E

500|$|In March 2010, it was {{confirmed}} that actor Matt Damon would guest star on 30 Rock, {{and in this}} season finale episode, he played Carol, an airline pilot and love interest for Fey's character, Liz Lemon. In December 2009, Entertainment Weekly informed Damon that he {{was at the top of}} Fey's guest star wish list for the show. When told about this, Damon, a fan of the show, responded [...] "I would do [...] in a heartbeat if they asked me to come on. She should call my people– or even better me. Or I could call her. Let's make this happen." [...] Damon has worked with Alec Baldwin, the latter who plays Jack Donaghy, in the 2006 feature films The Departed and The Good Shepherd. Damon's role on the show made it his second prime-time television appearance following his guest spot on Will & Grace—a series that previously aired on NBC—in 2002. When asked if he would return as Carol in the show's fifth season, Damon said [...] "If they'll <b>have</b> <b>me,</b> I would love to pop in and see the gang again.

500|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Music began in January 2000 at Sarm West Studios, Notting Hill, London. The first song that Madonna and Ahmadzaï worked on was [...] "Impressive Instant", {{since it was}} the most complete among all the demos that he had sent to the singer. The song was an instrumental and was not supposed to be included in Ahmadzaï's own album, Production. But Madonna had different ideas for the track and its lyrics, which she explained to the producer. Feeling that Madonna's vision about the song's composition would be difficult to create in Sarm West, Ahmadzaï wanted to return to Paris and work there on his own computer. [...] "There are a lot of chopped vocal tracks on 'Impressive Instant'...That was impossible to do in the studio. It doesn't make sense to rent a place like Sarm just to <b>have</b> <b>me</b> work on ten seconds of music all day, using only the one computer," [...] he added. Within the first ten days, they had recorded the backing vocals, acoustic guitars etc. on a Sony 48-track and transferred it to Logic Audio workstation, using the converters of the TC Electronic Finalizer; Ahmadzaï then went back to Paris with the recordings.|$|E
500|$|A pre-taped {{performance}} of Brown performing {{a medley of}} [...] "Beautiful People" [...] and [...] "Forever" [...] was shown on the American version of Dancing with the Stars on March 29, 2011. For the performance Brown wore {{a black and white}} suit, and was accompanied by a group of robotic dancers dressed in all-white suits adorned with LED lighting for a futuristic Tron-like affect. Prior to the performance some of the show's cast were unhappy that Brown was going to perform because of the domestic violence assault that occurred with his then-girlfriend Rihanna in 2009. Brown was sentenced to five years of probation, ordered to complete more than 1,400 hours of community service and was given a restraining order which required him to stay away from Rihanna. Professional dancer Cheryl Burke told Extra, [...] "As a victim of domestic violence, I don't agree with him coming on the show, but it's out of my control", while host Tom Bergeron told the On Air with Ryan Seacrest radio show that, [...] "I did tell the producers it may be to their advantage to not <b>have</b> <b>me</b> interview him, because my natural tendency would be to say something. So don't put me in a position where you are asking me to not say something, because I really won't do that." ...|$|E

It <b>has</b> taken <b>me</b> to places that {{otherwise}} I would not have seen. It <b>has</b> given <b>me</b> the world and great happiness. It <b>has</b> brought <b>me</b> friends and good companionship, camaraderie and brotherliness. It <b>has</b> thought <b>me</b> self-discipline and given me the retentive eye of an observer. It <b>has</b> enabled <b>me</b> love my fellow men. It <b>has</b> clothed <b>me,</b> watered me, fed me, kept me away from a bowler and a nine-till-five desk. It <b>has</b> given <b>me</b> cars, houses and holidays, bright days and cloudy ones. It <b>has</b> introduced <b>me</b> to kings and queens, presidents and princes. It has no barriers; it has no class. Whatever your background, if it decides to embrace and take you to its heart, it will hurl you up there amongst the gods. It will change your wooden clogs overnight {{and replace them with}} glass slippers.|$|R

500|$|A pre-taped {{performance}} of Brown performing [...] "Yeah 3x" [...] and {{a medley of}} [...] "Beautiful People" [...] and [...] "Forever" [...] was shown on the American version of Dancing with the Stars on March 29, 2011. For the performance, Brown wore a tomato red tuxedo and a black shirt and bow tie. The performance started off with a young boy doing break dancing moves and announcing, 'Here is Chris Brown'. Brown then appeared doing flips and somersaults, as he lip-synced most of the song. The performance earned him a standing ovation from the judges {{and members of the}} crowd. Prior to the performance, some of the show's cast were unhappy that Brown was going to perform because of the domestic violence assault that occurred with his then-girlfriend Rihanna in 2009. Brown was sentenced to five years of probation, ordered to complete more than 1,400 hours of community service and was given a restraining order which required him to stay away from Rihanna.

500|$|On December 8, 2011, Minaj tweeted {{that she}} was on set with Madonna filming the music video for [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin". She also said that Madonna kissed her on the lips, as a gift for her birthday. M.I.A. then tweeted about filming the video with Madonna, saying, [...] "Madonna killed it! A legend! said she'd <b>have</b> <b>me,</b> I said ill have her too". Directed by the team Megaforce—which {{consists}} of Léo Berne, Charles Brisgand, Raphaël Rodriguez and Clément Gallet—the video has a football and cheerleader theme, inspired by her then-upcoming Super Bowl halftime performance. Rodriguez explained to MTV News that they discussed the song with Solveig and understood that the video should be [...] "about happiness and something really sunny". The whole look was also dictated by the fact that Megaforce had never collaborated with Madonna, Minaj and M.I.A., feeling that it was a [...] "different universe" [...] for them. The video was shot for over two days in New York, with very strict timings which Megaforce found as challenging. Describing the process as like working with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Megaforce told Swedish newspaper 20 minutes that the set was surrounded by police patrol and security guards and mobile phones were not allowed. A total budget of US$1.5 million was allotted for the video. Some of the sequences in the video was Madonna's idea like one scene featuring her dancing in front of a wall, which Megaforce felt would not go with the main narrative. However, the singer insisted on keeping it and by the second day of filming she wrapped up early and left.|$|E

2500|$|Fator {{left the}} band and did a solo act {{combining}} comedy and ventriloquism but for many years had little success. [...] "Fairs would stick me on a little stage {{in the back of}} fair and <b>have</b> <b>me</b> do three shows in the hottest part of the afternoon," [...] related Fator. [...] "I had heat stroke a couple of times, almost passed out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Further {{evidence}} for the reported text theory is provided in how other plays are used throughout The Contention. For example, Marlowe's The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus is quoted in the witchcraft scene ("Now Faustus, what wouldst thou <b>have</b> <b>me</b> do?" [...] (1.3.36) is reproduced as [...] "Now Bolingbroke, what wouldst thou <b>have</b> <b>me</b> do?"), and Marlowe's Edward II is paraphrased in Act 3, Scene 1 (Marlowe's [...] "The wild O'Neill, with swarms of Irish kerns,/Lives uncontrolled within the English pale" [...] (2.2.163–164) becomes [...] "The wild O'Neill, my lords, is up in arms,/With troops of Irish kerns that uncontrolled/Doth plant themselves within the English pale"). Even a line from 3 Henry VI is used in Act 3, Scene 1 ("If our King Henry had shook hands with death" [...] (1.4.103)), all of which seems to suggest that, as is so often {{the case in the}} bad quartos, the reporter was filling in blanks (i.e. passages he couldn't remember) with extracts from other plays.|$|E
2500|$|She said, [...] "It is {{one thing}} for me to come before a public magistracy and there to speak what they would <b>have</b> <b>me</b> speak and another when a man comes to me in a way of {{friendship}} privately."

[...] The court, however, did not make any distinction between public and private statements.|$|E

Stands were analysed in the forest areasof Bohinj (Forest management region Bled) and Pohorje (FMR Maribor) with a total area of 29, 95 0 hectares. Analyses of silvicultural units were carried out on a systematically selected sample, amounting to 9 % and 10 % of forest area at the Bohinj and Pohorje sites, respectively. The average area of delineated stands at the Bohinj site was 1. 04 <b>ha</b> (<b>Me</b> = 0. 5 3 ha) and 2. 30 <b>ha</b> (<b>Me</b> = 1. 33 ha) in the Pohorje site.
