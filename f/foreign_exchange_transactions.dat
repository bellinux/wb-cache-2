This is the first empirical study to focus on the limitations when modelling <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> rate <b>transaction</b> exposure in emerging insurance markets. This work is based on the cash flow methodology proposed by Martin and Mauer (2003, 2005) in reference to banks, and employed by Li et al. (2009) when assessing US insurance companies. Some econometric methodological innovations have been introduced to study the limitations of modelling <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> rate <b>transaction</b> exposure in emerging insurance markets. An extensive literature review is followed by a quantitative investigation, to answer the following research questions. 1) Is the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>transaction</b> exposure, as measured by a fundamental (economic) method of modelling the interplay of <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> rates with other economic variables, significant, for all Egyptian insurance companies? 2) Is the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>transaction</b> exposure, as measured by a technical (statistical) way of modelling the interplay of <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> rates with other economic variables, significant for all Egyptian insurance companies? 3) Is the <b>exchange</b> <b>transaction</b> exposure for the Egyptian insurance industry, as a whole, significant? Although the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> rate <b>transaction</b> exposure for the Egyptian insurance industry, as a whole, is insignificant (question 3), the percentage of Egyptian insurers affected by <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> rate <b>transaction</b> exposure in US dollars, estimated at the individual firm level, was found to be 22...|$|R

Foreign exchange allocations to banks, ministries, and enterprises were all approved by the State Administration of Exchange Control. The Bank of China, the foreign exchange arm of the People's Bank of China, lost its monopoly on all <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>transactions</b> in 1984 when the Agricultural Bank, People's Construction Bank, China Industrial and Commercial Bank, and China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) were permitted to deal in foreign currency. The Bank of China remained China's principal foreign exchange bank and provided loans for production and commercial transactions related to exports, set up branches overseas, maintained correspondent relations with foreign banks, and did research on international monetary trends. The Bank of China also was active in international financial markets through such activities as loan syndication and issuing of foreign bonds. CITIC, formed in 1979 to facilitate foreign investment in China, also borrowed and lent internationally and issued foreign bonds in addition to encouraging and participating in joint ventures, importing foreign technology and equipment, and making overseas investments. In 1986 CITIC was renamed CITIC Group and shifted its emphasis to power, metallurgical, and raw materials industries, which had trouble attracting investments. In late 1986 the CITIC Group had set up 47 joint ventures, invested in 114 domestic companies, and issued US$550 million in foreign bonds. The China Investment Bank was established in 1981 as a channel for medium- and long-term loans from international financial {{institutions such as the}} World Bank.|$|E
