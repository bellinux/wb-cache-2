50|$|Type 032-1 is the unarmed {{prototype}} of the Type 032 series, and eventually, {{it is also the}} only one completed among the series. Political upheaval has caused numerous problems in that the subsystems could not be ready because many subsystems delivered was in such poor quality that they were rejected immediately upon <b>inspection.</b> <b>Type</b> 032 is powered by lead batteries used by railway cargo carts. Construction was finally completed in November 1958 at Jiangnan Shipyard, but sea trials had to be conducted at Lushunkou. The reason to select Lushunkou as the test site is because water depth averages only 70 meters in Lushunkou, much shallower than that of Shanghai region, so if accident occurs during sea trials, {{it would be easier to}} carry out rescue missions. In addition, Lushunkou is also the only base in China at the time where Chinese submarine fleet is stationed, and the commander of the base at the time, Major general Liu Huaqing provided great support to the program. In order to make the trip, Type 032-1 had to be first loaded on a barge at Jiangnan Shipyard to be shipped to the Shanghai railway station in the north via Huangpu River. The midget sub was then loaded on a flatbed railway cart to be transported to Lushunkou. Crew to conduct sea trials also traveled by the same cargo train, with a temporary hut built on one of the flatbed carts of the same train. After three days travel by railway, the midget sub reached its destination and was transferred to a pier at the base, with sea trials immediate followed.|$|E

40|$|Wind turbine {{maintenance}} {{is emerging as}} an unexpectedly high component of turbine operating cost, {{and there is an}} increasing interest in managing this cost. This thesis presents an alternative view of maintenance as a value-driver, and develops an optimization algorithm to evaluate the value delivered by different maintenance techniques. I view maintenance as an operation that moves the turbine to an improved state in which it can generate more power and, thus, earn more revenue. To implement this approach, I model the stochastic deterioration of the turbine in two dimensions: the deterioration rate, and the extent of deterioration, and then use maintenance to improve the state of the turbine. The value of the turbine is the difference between the revenue from to the power generation and the costs incurred in operation and maintenance. With a focus on blade deterioration, I evaluate the value delivered by implementing two different maintenance schemes, predictive maintenance and scheduled maintenance. An example of predictive maintenance technique is the use of Condition Monitoring Systems to precisely detect deterioration. I model Condition Monitoring System (CMS) of different degrees of fidelity, where a higher fidelity CMS would allow the blade state to be determined with a higher precision. The same model is then applied for the scheduled maintenance technique. The improved state information obtained from these techniques is then used to derive an optimal maintenance strategy. The difference between the value of the turbine with and without the <b>inspection</b> <b>type</b> can be interpreted as the value of the inspection. The results indicate that a higher fidelity (and more expensive) inspection method does not necessarily yield the highest value, and, that there is an optimal level of fidelity that results in maximum value. The results also aim to inform the operator of the impact of regional parameters such as wind speed, variance and maintenance costs to the optimal maintenance strategy. The contributions of this work are twofold. First, I present a practical approach to wind turbine valuation that takes operating and market conditions into account. This work should therefore be useful to wind farm operators, investors and decision makers. Second, I show how the value of a maintenance scheme can be explicitly assessed for different conditions. ...|$|E

40|$|Efficient {{production}} quality {{control is a}} major issue to manufacturers. After all, cost-efficiently {{improving the quality of}} products, processes and services is -in the present global business environment- a key focus point of many organizations in their struggle to improve their profitability, market share and competitiveness. The achievement of quality involves many different aspects, yielding different fields of study: designing quality, manufacturing quality, servicing quality and managing quality. In this thesis, focus is on a specific tool for achieving high manufacturing quality: quality inspections. Quality inspections are used to evaluate the quality characteristics of a product, possibly at several phases in its production process. If an inspected product (or product part) is found to be of a (too) low quality, it can either be reworked or rejected. The domain of quality economics studies the costs and benefits related to these efforts for achieving manufacturing or service quality. Most production processes consist of a sequence of production stages. Each stage (but the last) produces input for the next production stage. As the production processes at each stage are generally stochastic in nature, deviations from expected product specifications occur, which, without intervention, will accumulate {{in the course of the}} production process. Quality inspection only at the last stage could therefore result in a large number of faulty products and high rework and scrap costs. An optimal inspection strategy for a so-called serial multistage production system (MSPS) therefore has to decide on (i) the number and location of inspection stations, (ii) the size of the production fraction subject to inspection (sample size) and (iii) the rigor of the inspections (acceptance limits) at each inspection station, in order to minimize total expected inspection costs. Simplified, more and tighter inspection will normally induce a higher product quality [...] in terms of meeting product specifications [...] but will also result in higher costs of inspection, scrap and rework. Quantifying this trade-off and thus establishing ways of finding an economic optimum is at the heart of this research. To our best of knowledge, this dissertation contains the first method for jointly optimizing the number and location of inspection stations, their <b>inspection</b> <b>type,</b> inspection limits and inspection sampling parameters. Thereto, the dissertation is organized as follows: in Chapter 1 a sketch of the general domain of quality economics is drawn, in order to situate the thesis project in its research environment. The actual subject of this thesis, economic design of quality inspection strategies for multistage processes, builds on the techniques presented in this introductory Chapter. The MSPS inspection optimization problem itself, with the problem-specific issues and the literature on it, are discussed separately, in Chapter 2. A variety of theoretical work has been published on the subject of optimal inspection allocation for multistage process chains, i. e. on the decision of where to place inspection stations in multistage processes. Some of the seminal papers that are discussed date back to the 60 's. Tolerancing, or the separate optimization of inspection limits, has also received a lot of attention in the literature, as has the economic design of sampling schemes and control charts. However, the literature review reveals a void where jointly looking into all aspects of inspection policy setting for MSPS'es is concerned. Chapter 3 investigates analytical solutions to the MSPS inspection optimization problem. First, the MSPS modeling framework used in this thesis, is introduced. Thereupon, analytical calculations for some examples cases are proposed, with an eye to gain an insight into the possibilities of tackling the MSPS inspection optimization problem analytically. Finally, some light is shed on the limitations of an analytical approach. The metaheuristic solution method for the MSPS inspection optimization proposed in this thesis, is presented in Chapter 4. Thereto, the Chapter starts with an introduction to, preliminaries for, and an overview of mathematical optimization. An overview of methods based on systematic or deterministic search techniques is introduced. Subsequently, an overview of methods based on random or stochastic search techniques is proposed. One of these techniques, namely evolutionary algorithms, is the basis for the suggested solution method. The solution technique essentially consists of combining an evolutionary algorithm with simulation. Simulation is used to model the MSPS subject to inspection and to calculate the resulting inspection costs, an evolutionary algorithm is proposed to optimize the inspection strategies. The solution approach is outlined and examples are computed, indicating the potential of the metaheuristic for optimizing quality inspection. Subsequently, the influence of the (exogenous) cost parameters on the outcome of the MSPS inspection optimization problem is illustrated. The Chapter also contains two Appendices. The first is concerned with reviewing some of the other frequently used metaheuristics; and it is discussed why preference was given to an EA to tackle the MSPS inspection optimization problem. The second Appendix is devoted to a discussion on statistical analysis (reliability and confidence intervals) of simulation output. In Chapter 5, a case study is built to explore the characteristics, possibilities and limitations of the proposed metaheuristic solution technique. First the cases are presented; 26 different -yet comparable- cases were selected, each with distinct process and cost characteristics, in order to gain insight in the possibilities of the metaheuristic in various situations. Consecutively, the computational results are discussed. Concluding comments, and suggestions for further research are presented in Chapter 6...|$|E
