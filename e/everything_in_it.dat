Alain de Lille, c.1195, accused the Cathars of believing in two gods - one of light, one of darkness. Durand de Huesca, responding to a Cathar tract c.1220 indicates that they regarded the physical world as the creation of Satan.

25|$|In Book 2, {{electricity}} and gravity {{are described as}} fundamental forces of the will.

The fundamental nature of the universe and <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> is seen as this will. Schopenhauer presents a pessimistic picture on which unfulfilled desires are painful, and pleasure is merely the sensation experienced at the instant one such pain is removed. However, most desires are never fulfilled, and those that are fulfilled are instantly replaced by more unfulfilled ones.|$|E

In the Changsega, Mireuk makes the world and <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> while in the Chogamje, Dosu Munjang makes only the world, the suns, and the moons. Throughout Korea, myths tell of Mireuk (Northern Korea), the Humun brothers (Central Korea), or Daebyeol (Southern Korea), who destroyed {{each of the two}} suns and moons.

Using the Thor machine once again, the team arrives in the new period where they meet a ninja named Suzu who accompanies them (except in the original release). After meeting with a group of elves, Cress obtains the legendary Eternal Sword, {{the only thing that can}} stop Dhaos from moving through time, and travel to his invisible fortress for the final confrontation. After finally defeating him, the party learns from a tree spirit named Martel that he is a visitor from a dying planet called Derris Karran, whose world was slowly withering due to the death of its world tree, the source of all mana and lifeblood of <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> Attempting to obtain a seed from this planet's world tree, Yggdrasil, Dhaos instead found that its power was fading as well due to the humans' constant misuse of mana-based technology, and decided to wipe them out to save it. As the party members realize that by saving their world they have doomed his, Martel takes pity on their plight and sends a mana seed into space in an attempt to rejuvenate Derris-Kharlan's tree as Cress and his team return to their proper times.|$|E

[...] An estimated 11,000species of seed-bearing plants and 400species of land or water vertebrates live in the Everglades, but slight variations in water levels affect many organisms and reshape land formations. The health and productivity of any ecosystem relies on the number of species present: the loss of one species weakens the entire ecosystem.|$|E

500|$|Most New Age groups {{believe in}} an Ultimate Source {{from which all}} things originate, which is usually conflated with the divine. Various {{creation}} myths have been articulated in New Age publications outlining how this Ultimate Source created the universe and <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> In contrast, some New Agers emphasise {{the idea of a}} universal inter-relatedness that is not always emanating from a single source. The New Age worldview emphasises holism and the idea that everything in existence is intricately connected as part of a single whole, in doing so rejecting both the dualism of Judeo-Christian thought and the reductionism of Cartesian science. A number of New Agers have linked this holistic interpretation of the universe to the Gaia hypothesis of James Lovelock. The idea of holistic divinity results in a common New Age belief that humans themselves are divine in essence, a concept described using such terms as [...] "droplet of divinity", [...] "inner Godhead", and [...] "divine self". Influenced by Theosophical and Anthroposophical ideas regarding 'subtle bodies', a common New Age idea holds to the existence of a [...] "Higher Self" [...] which {{is a part of the}} human but which connects with the divine essence of the universe, and which can advise the human mind through intuition.|$|E
