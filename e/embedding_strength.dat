30|$|The <b>embedding</b> <b>strength</b> of wood {{increased}} {{in proportion to}} an increase in the wood density, and decreased with an increase in the diameter of the fastener [5, 7, 9, 10]. The regression line of the <b>embedding</b> <b>strength</b> in relation to both the wood density and fastener diameter has been investigated to estimate the <b>embedding</b> <b>strength</b> for design. When the fastener diameter was in the range of 8 – 30  mm, the <b>embedding</b> <b>strength</b> or <b>embedding</b> <b>strength</b> divided by the density linearly decreased as the fastener diameter increased [7, 9, 11]. This tendency was observed in the embedding strengths parallel and perpendicular to the grain, and the difference between the <b>embedding</b> <b>strength</b> parallel to the grain and that perpendicular to the grain decreased as the fastener diameter decreased [7, 12]. Another factor that changes the <b>embedding</b> <b>strength</b> is the moisture content (MC). The relationship between the MC and the ratio of the <b>embedding</b> <b>strength</b> at a given MC to that at an MC of 12  % was obtained from the data in the reports [13, 14]. When the MC was less than the fiber saturation point, the ratio of the <b>embedding</b> <b>strength</b> parallel to the grain changed by an average of about 3.4  % per 1  % of MC, whereas that perpendicular to the grain changed by an average of about 3.2  % per 1  % of MC.|$|E

Dowel diameters were 8, 12, 16, and 20 mm. <b>Embedding</b> <b>strength</b> was evaluated by the 5 % off-set method and a maximum load up to 5 mm displacement according to EN 383. The <b>embedding</b> <b>strength</b> parallel to the grain evaluated by the former method showed values close to those obtained with the latter method, but they showed a significant difference in tests conducted {{perpendicular to the}} grain.

30|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for blind audio watermarking. The proposed scheme utilizes the flexibility of discrete wavelet packet transformation (DWPT) to approximate the critical bands and adaptively determines suitable <b>embedding</b> <b>strengths</b> for carrying out quantization index modulation (QIM). The singular value decomposition (SVD) is employed to analyze the matrix formed by the DWPT coefficients and embed watermark bits by manipulating singular values subject to perceptual criteria. To achieve even better performance, two auxiliary enhancement measures {{are attached to the}} developed scheme. Performance evaluation and comparison are demonstrated with the presence of common digital signal processing attacks. Experimental results confirm that the combination of the DWPT, SVD, and adaptive QIM achieves imperceptible data hiding with satisfying robustness and payload capacity. Moreover, the inclusion of self-synchronization capability allows the developed watermarking system to withstand time-shifting and cropping attacks.|$|R
30|$|At present, {{the main}} {{contents}} of information hiding algorithm research include {{the relationship between}} the <b>embedded</b> <b>strength</b> of information [21, 22], hidden capacity [23, 24], and imperceptibility. In order to find hidden algorithms that meet the invisibility and large capacity of the carrier image at the same time, some scholars use genetic algorithms to optimize the embedded parameters and find the optimal solution, thus opening up a new research approach. Genetic algorithm is an optimized search algorithm with strong robustness. It can quickly and efficiently calculate complex nonlinear multidimensional data. It is good at solving global optimization problems. Genetic algorithms have two distinct characteristics, namely global search characteristics and parallelism. At present, the research of genetic algorithm in information hiding is mainly applied in some digital watermarking technologies [25]. The goal of using genetic algorithm to optimize is mainly to search for appropriate embedded parameters and embedded positions, and genetic algorithms are used to optimize the objective function consisting of invisibility and robustness.|$|R

It is {{stated that}} Diamond saw blades requires high <b>embedding</b> <b>strength</b> of the diamond, while diamond drill bits do not. It {{is necessary to}} improve the <b>embedding</b> <b>strength</b> of diamond in diamond saw blades, {{rather than in the}} diamond drilling bits. It is recommended to count the number of diamond particles on the matrix surface and get the <b>embedding</b> <b>strength</b> of diamond by calculation. Another recommendation is to use the compound powder of cobalt and tungsten carbide for pelletizing in order to improve the <b>embedding</b> <b>strength</b> of diamond and lower the cost of matrix. There are people studying how to raise <b>embedding</b> <b>strength</b> of diamond, for both diamond saw blades and diamond drilling bit. However, the requirements for <b>embedding</b> <b>strength</b> of diamond saw blades and diamond drilling bit are different. The following parts include the analysis for this problem. Requirement of <b>embedding</b> <b>strength</b> for diamond drilling bit As shown in Figure 1, there are two counter forces on the surface diamond drill bit matrix. Force n is upwards, which won’t causes the diamond to fall off. The only possibility is Force t. Force t forms a very small torque, which can hardly pull the diamond down, especially in the presence of Force n. Only when the matrix has worn away heavily, the diamond might fall down...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Based {{on energy}} {{distribution}} analysis of orthogonal FRIT coefficients, a novel digital image watermark embedding and blind detecting algorithm in ridgelet domain is proposed in this paper. Since the ridgelet transform has directional sensitivity and anisotropy, {{the image is}} first partitioned into small pieces and the orthogonal FRIT is applied for each piece to obtain a sparse representation of the image, especially for straight edge singularity. Through analyzing texture distribution in ridgelet coefficients of each piece, these image pieces are classified into frat regions and texture regions by Fuzzy C-Mean (FCM) clustering algorithm. The texture regions used for watermark embedding also classified into two regions, strong texture regions and week texture regions for different <b>embedding</b> <b>strengths</b> based on the features of luminance masking and texture masking. And the watermarks can be blindly detected without the original image and watermark information.

40|$|Increasing {{transmission}} of medical images across multiple user systems raises concerns for image security. Hiding watermark information in medical image data files is one solution for enhancing {{security and privacy protection}} of data. Medical image watermarking however {{is not a}} widely studied area, due partially to speculations on loss in viewer performance caused by degradation of image information. Such concerns are addressed if the amount of information lost due to watermarking can be kept at minimal levels and below visual perception thresholds. This paper describes experiments where three alternative visual quality metrics were used to assess the degradation caused by watermarking medical images. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT) medical images were watermarked using different methods: Block based Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) with various <b>embedding</b> <b>strengths.</b> The visual degradation of each watermarking parameter setting was assessed using Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Measure (SSIM) and Steerable Visual Difference Predictor (SVDP) numerical metrics.

M-band decomposition {{of the host}} image offers advantages of better scale-space tiling and good energy compactness.

First, a single bit watermark embedding algorithm is developed using independent and identically distributed (i. i. d) Gaussian watermark. This is further modified to design a high payload system for binary watermark image using a set of binary spreading code patterns. Watermark decoding performance is improved by multiple stage detection through cancelation of multiple bit interference (MBI) effect.
