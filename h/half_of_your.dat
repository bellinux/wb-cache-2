500|$|On January 8, 2002 Smith learned via a {{phone call}} he had been elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame on his first ballot by {{receiving}} 91.7% of the votes cast. As it happened, the Olympic torch was passing through St. Louis {{on its way to}} Salt Lake City for the 2002 Winter Olympics, and Smith served as a torchbearer in a ceremony with St. Louis Rams' quarterback Kurt Warner that evening. Smith was inducted into the Hall of Fame during ceremonies on July 28, 2002. During his speech, he compared his baseball experiences with the characters from the novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, after which his son Dustin presented his Hall of Fame plaque. Days later on August 11, Smith was back at Busch Memorial Stadium for the unveiling of a statue in his likeness made by sculptor Harry Weber. Weber chose to emphasize Smith's defensive skills by showing Smith stretched horizontal to the ground while fielding a baseball. At the ceremony Weber told Smith, [...] "You spent <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> career up in the air. That makes it difficult for a sculptor to do something with it." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} generally negative {{reviews from}} film critics. LaRue Cook of Entertainment Weekly graded the film with a [...] "D" [...] and wrote, [...] "what {{was once a}} fresh slice of teen comedy has become a slab of stale crudeness." [...] Scott Weinberg of Moviefone, in his negative review, found the film [...] "slightly more amusing to sit through than the two previous entries", in particular praising the Star Trek sexual roleplay scene as [...] "extremely effective." [...] DVD Talk's Jeffrey Robinson writes that [...] "if anything, it will bore you and leave you wondering why you wasted {{an hour and a}} <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> life." [...] Writing in JoBlo.com, Adam Quigley poked fun at the film's themes, declaring that [...] "if there's a lesson to be taken from these films, it's that women are objects, and should always be treated as such." [...] IGNs Hock Teh gave the film 5/10, writing that it [...] "stays very close to the American Pie formula," [...] while criticizing the story as [...] "devoid of anything remotely semi-compelling or even noteworthy." [...] Peter Hammond of Maxim describes American Pie Presents: Beta House as [...] "loaded with sex, laughs and raunchy fun," [...] writing that it [...] "may be the most outrageous slice of pie yet!" ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the main}} aspects of the series that critics point out, either {{positively}} or negatively, is that the series [...] "never strays from its classic roots." [...] Unlike other modern, complex RPGs, Dragon Quest on the DS retains the simple gameplay from the first game that many critics find refreshing and nostalgic. Points of contention are its battle system, comparatively simplistic storylines, general lack of character development, simplistic primitive-looking graphics (in earlier titles), and the overall difficulty of the game. These arguments are countered by noting its strength in episodic storytelling with the various non-player characters the party meets. The stories avoid melodrama and feature relatively more simplistic characters than Final Fantasys Squall Leonhart or Tidus, a source of contention. There are exceptions, however, such as Dragon Quest V, which has been praised for its unique, emotional storytelling. Battles are also simple and finish quickly. As for difficulty, Yuji Horii is noted as a gambler. The lack of save points and the general difficulty of the battles were included {{with the intention of}} adding a sense of tension. Because of this added difficulty, the punishment for the party's death was toned down compared to other games by simply going back to where you had last saved, with <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> gold on hand. When asked about criticism of Dragon Quest games, Horii says he does not mind, it means the critics played the game and he would rather know their concerns than remain ignorant.|$|E

6000|$|... "Cospetto! {{you might}} as well ask me, Signore, what induces these {{republicans}} to do a thousand other out-of-the-way things. What has made them behead Louis XVI?
