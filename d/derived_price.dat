40|$|This report uses a {{model that}} {{considers}} the effect of both factor and output prices on marketed surplus. To derive input demand and output supply elasticities, the normalized quadratic profit function and demand equations were estimated jointly with the seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR) estimation technique using farm level panel data. The data confirm the theoretical framework. The <b>derived</b> <b>price</b> elasticities of input demand, output supply, and marketed surplus have been simulated to examine alternative price policies for securing different levels of marketed surplus. At the observed price structure, the marketed surplus of wheat will increase almost equal to population growth, but in case of paddy it will grow at a very low rate. The study further reveals that besides price adjustment, technological improvement and non-price factors are also of critical importance for increasing output supply and, hence, marketed surplus.

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} basic results of Houck’s insight for derived demand elasticities {{for the case}} of joint {{products}} by allowing {{for the possibility of}} the joint and raw products being traded. Theoretical relationships between individual demands for a set of jointly-produced commodities that are traded and composite demand for the raw product from which the joint products originate are derived. It is shown that while the <b>derived</b> <b>price</b> elasticity of domestic demand retains the same form as Houck’s original formula, the relevant price elasticities of demand to include in the formula are elasticities of total demand instead of domestic demand elasticities. Using the USA soybean industry as an example, this generalised formula that takes into account trade is implemented to calculate the elasticity of total demand for USA soybeans. The usefulness of this formula for policy-makers to trace out the impacts of changes in market conditions and trade policy in the joint-products, and how it will impact the price elasticity of domestic and total demand for the raw product, is demonstrated.

40|$|Graduation date: 1988 The overall {{objective}} of the research reported here is to empirically measure the ability of farmers to mitigate the impact of rising electricity prices by substituting relatively inexpensive alternative inputs. A dual cost methodology is employed because it allows theoretically consistent derivation of own price and factor substitution elasticities, conditional upon exogenously determined environmental, economic and technological constraints. Furthermore, the framework allows for {{an assessment of the}} appropriateness of producer cost minimization behavior, which has been assumed but not explicitly tested in earlier studies. A secondary objective is to analyze possible implications of future irrigation electricity price changes on producer, regional economic and electric utility company welfare. The most notable finding is that the demand for irrigation electricity is quite price elastic. This indicates that, historically, when the price of electricity has been relatively high, producers have found ways to use less of this input. The <b>derived</b> <b>price</b> elasticity of demand for irrigation electricity (- 1. 45) confirms results of other researchers. Gardener and Young; Whittlesey; and Maddigan, Chern and Rizy all estimated price elasticity for irrigation in the range from - 1 to - 2. Tests of the conditions necessary to maintain the assumption of cost minimization, do not confirm that this assumption is strictly justified in the present study...|$|E
30|$|While most {{previous}} {{studies on the}} price elasticity of electricity demand have focused on residential electricity use, {{little attention has been}} given to the price elasticity of industrial and commercial electricity demand. For instance, Pindyck (1979) examined industrial and commercial electricity demand using 1959 – 1973 data from 10 developed countries to estimate price elasticity in each country and found that the price elasticity of the demand was significantly low (from − 0.07 to − 0.16). Similarly, Bohi and Zimmerman (1984) reviewed several {{previous studies}} conducted in the USA and found low price elasticity for industrial electricity demand in the short run (between − 0.10 and − 0.27) {{as well as in the}} long run (between − 0.61 and − 3.55). However, for commercial electricity demand, they found low price elasticity in the short run (− 0.27) but high elasticity in the long run (between − 1.05 and − 4.56). Hisnanick and Kyer (1995) and Kamershen and Porter (2004) adopted time-series data from the USA. Hisnanick and Kyer (1995) used manufacturing industry data for 1958 – 1985 and found a low price elasticity value of − 0.19. Using industrial and commercial sector data for 1973 – 1998, Kamershen and Porter (2004) <b>derived</b> <b>price</b> elasticity values ranging between − 0.34 and − 0.55 for industrial and commercial electricity demand.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{numerical}} procedure for the pricing of financial contracts whose contingent claims {{are exposed to}} two sources of risk: the stock price and the short interest rate. More precisely, in our pricing framework {{we assume that the}} stock price dynamics is described by the Cox, Ross Rubinstein (CRR, 1979) binomial model under a stochastic risk free rate, whose dynamics evolves over time accordingly to the Black, Derman and Toy (BDT, 1990) one-factor model. To this aim, we set the hypothesis that the instantaneous correlation between the trajectories of the future stock price (conditional on the current value of the short rate) and of the future short rate is zero and we therefore show that the hypothesis of absence of instantaneous correlation between the two mentioned risk factors does not necessarily imply that also their terminal correlation is zero. We then apply the resulting stock price dynamics to evaluate the price of a simple contract, i. e. of a stock option. Finally, we compare the <b>derived</b> <b>price</b> to the price of the same option under different pricing models, as the traditional Black and Scholes (1973) model. We expect that, the difference in the two prices is not sensibly large. We conclude showing in which cases it should be helpful to adopt the described model for pricing purposes...|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: pages 98 - 101. This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} demand for illuminating Paraffin (IP) and Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) in South Africa, and also tests the energy transition theory. The energy transition process outlines the substitution of fuels that occurs with rural-urban migration. Data on income, IP and LPG prices, demographic trends and IP and LPG volumes are incorporated in models to test the energy transition theory: National and regional projections of demand are derived. Income and price elasticities are derived for testing the energy transition theory, where Engel's Law is applied. The <b>derived</b> <b>price</b> and income elasticities for the regional IP models largely confirm the energy transition process where poorer areas are price inelastic. The models of the urban electrified areas and the predominantly rural areas, produce negative income elasticities which reduce the forecasts and suggest that IP is an inferior good due to the availability of superior electricity or free wood respectively. Electrification will {{play a role in}} reducing consumption of IP and LPG. However, it can be concluded that due to the predominant price and income inelasticity of demand, the smooth and exclusive transition from wood to IP and LPG and finally electricity suggested by (Viljoen, 1990) is perhaps misleading. It is more likely that tardiness in substituting one fuel for another will impede the complete transition among fuels and that the use of a range of fuels, even if electricity becomes available, will be maintained for some time as the newly urbanised household moves up the modernisation index. The forecasts for IP and LPG for the period 1992 to 1995, emanating from the econometric models developed here, forecast lower growth in consumption as compared with the recent past. The national forecasts for 1992 to 1995 are half those achieved in the last upturn of 1986 to 1989. LPG forecasts are similarly about 50 % lower than the historic period. However, the growth in both products is still forecast to be double the projected GDP growth. The regional IP forecasts show most of the growth occurring in the urban areas and the "homelands" closer to the metropoles. High growth is particularly forecast for the large PWV complex with its dense concentration of population and high rate of immigration. In summary, the transitional fuels will remain important energy sources for some time to come. The variables such as population growth, income and IP and LPG prices are significant in determining demand. In spite of Eskom's ambitious plans to provide "electricity for all" a significant proportion of the population will remain without electricity. It is therefore important for policy-makers to ensure that the prices of IP and LPG paid by the consumer are within income constraints as energy is a basic need...|$|E
