In Slovenia, the participation of adults in education is relatively high, but there are great differences regarding age and education. In some EU countries (Finland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Austria and Belgium) adults may receive material incentives of different types for participation in education (free tuition, scholarships, financial supplements, loans for education, tax reliefs, individual learning accounts, vouchers, cheques for education).

40|$|Background: The {{paper is}} aimed at {{indicating}} {{the similarities and differences}} in use of benefits supporting work–life balance (WLB) between women and men working in Polish small/medium and large enterprises. Material and Methods: The sample included 556 workers (311 women, 245 men), aged 20 – 68 years old employed on the basis of employment contracts {{for at least a year}} in Polish enterprises. The respondents completed a questionnaire on the use of benefits guaranteed by the Polish Labour Code, referring to their current workplaces. Results: Women took maternity leaves and returned to the same work position after using childcare leaves more often than men. Men took leaves on demand more often than women. Our results also showed that in comparison to women working in smaller enterprises, those working in large enterprises were more likely to use almost all the analyzed WLB benefits – paid days off to take care of others, <b>educational</b> <b>leaves,</b> leaves on demand, maternity leaves and return to the same work position after childcare leave, reduction of business trips when pregnant or having young children and breastfeeding breaks. The size of enterprise, however, did not differentiate the take-up of benefits among the studied men. Conclusions: Our analysis brought unexpected results on the lack of common availability of the WLB benefits guaranteed by the law in the case of employees who worked on the basis of employment contracts. We also found that women used most of child rearing benefits guaranteed by the law more often than men, which might reflect still a traditional division of child care responsibilities in Poland.

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the effect of}} Additional Career Assistance (ACA) on educational outcomes for students in Lower Track Secondary Schools (LTSS) for the area of Freiburg (Germany). The analysis uses individual data during the late 2000 's on grades in LTSS and <b>educational</b> outcomes after <b>leaving</b> LTSS. Compared to LTSS students in the surroundings of Freiburg, students in the City of Freiburg receive more intensive information, counselling, and mentoring regarding the school-to-work transition and vocational training (ACA). The goal of ACA is to foster {{the transition to the}} labor market. Many LTSS students with good grades participate in additional teaching during the last two years in LTSS, thus preparing themselves for a higher <b>educational</b> degree after <b>leaving</b> LTSS. We investigate the effect of ACA on grade development in LTSS and on <b>educational</b> upgrading after <b>leaving</b> LTSS. Our empirical analysis shows negligible effects of ACA on educational outcomes, which, however, mask quite heterogeneous effects. In fact, educational outcomes worsen (improve) for German students who (do not) participate in additional teaching. We find no significant effects for students with a migration background...|$|R

Gairdner remained on the fringe of this group until March 1893 “Where he experienced the overwhelming ‘embrace of Christ’, and responded in faith.” It was at the Congress of Unions at Oxford that brought Gairdner to this point and pushed him into a new passion for service and witness. Gairdner finished his time at Oxford in 1897 but that would not be the last time he would spend in diligent study.In 1910 after serving eleven years with the Church Missionary Society in Cairo, Egypt, Gairdner was granted a one-year leave of absence in order to study Arabic and Islam. Gairdner was gone for a total of eighteen months leaving at the end of May 1910 and returning to Cairo in November 1911. Gairdner made three major stops on this <b>educational</b> <b>leave,</b> the first being in Potsdam, Germany in order to study the German language and be able to read German literature of which there were many writings on Islamic topics.

50|$|There {{are many}} {{challenges}} facing business leaders on reservations.

The concentration of poverty and geographic isolation of many reservations severely limits the human capital from which business owners may draw to develop their business plans. The lack of disposable income of residents, furthermore, leaves reservation businesses with a limited customer base, while the shortcomings of telecommunications technologies can prevent expansion beyond reservation borders. In addition to material challenges facing economic development, some have criticized the ideological view of business ownership and development as solutions to reservation poverty. These critics have stated that conventional capitalist business plans run counter to many Native traditions, which stress community and interdependence rather than individualism and competition.|$|R
