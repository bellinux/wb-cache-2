40|$|This {{investigation}} first conducted field surveys about outdoor {{thermal comfort}} in Tianjin, China by monitoring microclimates and interviewing subjects in a park. Although the outdoor thermal environment varied greatly with air temperature from − 5. 0 to 34. 5 °C, {{a total of}} 83. 3 % of respondents considered the overall comfort to be “acceptable”. A “slightly warm” sensation was {{perceived to be the}} most comfortable during the cold season, “neutral” in the shoulder season, and “slightly cool” in the hot season. This study evaluated the three most widely used thermal comfort models in outdoor thermal comfort studies. The Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) overestimated the thermal sensation by 1. 3 times. The neutral Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) range found in this study was 11 – 24 °C, which was significantly different from the ranges found in Europe and Taiwan. The Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) provided a satisfactory prediction of thermal comfort within the scope of our study, but the UTCI thermal sensation range derived in our study differs from the range found in Mediterranean climates. These results indicate that these models are not accurate when predicting outdoor thermal comfort. ^ Previous thermal comfort models can only give a single value prediction of the occupant’s thermal comfort. However, due to great spatial and time variability of outdoor thermal environments, the thermal comfort for a group of people in an outdoor space has a wide distribution. To address this issue, this study applied the econometric and statistics method and developed an ordered probability model for outdoor thermal comfort by using the observations obtained from field surveys in Tianjin, China. This model can calculate the thermal sensation vote (TSV) distribution and can thus provide more information than traditional models. Air temperature (Ta), global solar radiation (G), wind speed (Va), the metabolic rate of occupants (MET), clothing (CLO), and the hot <b>day</b> <b>indicator</b> (HOT) were found to significantly affect the TSV distribution. The model performance test shows that the average difference between the predicted and sampled probability for different TSV categories was 2. 61 %. This model provides a new and more informative tool when studying outdoor thermal comfort. ^ The ordered probability model is developed based on statistical method and have no physical and physiological bearing. Thus, it is limited to the region where the data are obtained. To make the prediction of outdoor thermal comfort universally applicable, this study developed a multi-segment model based on heat transfer at various segments. This heat transfer included convection, radiation, and evaporation on bare skin and skin covered with clothing. The model accounts for non-uniform clothing insulation across different body segments with transient heat transfer in the clothing. The heat transfer between two body segments was estimated from blood circulation through counter-current heat exchange. The model allows calculation of complicated radiative heat transfer between the human body and the outdoor thermal environment. The developed model can be applied in a transient and non-uniform outdoor environment. The validity of the model was tested in various indoor and outdoor thermal environment. We conducted human subject tests in Tianjin, China and West Lafayette, United States to collect data for the outdoor validation. Using a total of 26 human subjects in 94 tests under these climatic conditions, this study measured outdoor thermal environmental parameters, monitored subjects’ skin temperature, and recorded subjects’ thermal sensation. Good agreement was observed between the measured and calculated mean skin temperature. However, the deviation between the predicted and measured local skin temperature under extreme cold condition can be as large as 6 K. ^ Finally, a dynamic outdoor thermal sensation model was developed by using the data collected from the human subject tests. Analysis of the test data showed that the thermal load, the mean skin temperature, and the change rate of the mean skin temperature of the subjects tested were the most important parameters affecting their thermal comfort in the outdoor spaces. These three parameters were integrated as predictor variables into a comfort model for predicting the outdoor thermal sensation. The model uses the thermal load to evaluate the thermal environment, and the mean skin temperature, and its change rate to consider dynamic changes in the thermal state of the human body. The validity of the model developed in one region was tested with the use of data obtained from the other region. ^ For the future work, to improve the performance of the human heat transfer model in predicting local skin temperatures, more accurate data on local segments’ properties should be acquired. Furthermore, a systematic framework of designing comfortable outdoor spaces should be developed. Designers could follow the framework to obtain the required inputs and use the inputs to evaluate the thermal comfort of designed outdoor spaces. (Abstract shortened by ProQuest.) ...|$|E

40|$|Travel {{time and}} travel time {{reliability}} are important performance measures for assessing traffic condition {{and extent of}} congestion on a roadway. This study first uses a floating car technique to assess travel time and travel time reliability {{on a number of}} Indiana highways. Then the study goes on to describe the use of Bluetooth technology to collect real travel time data on a freeway and applies it to obtain two weeks of data on Interstate 69 in Indianapolis. An autoregressive model, estimated based on the collected data, is then proposed to predict individual vehicle travel times on a freeway segment. This model includes speed, volume, time of <b>day</b> <b>indicators,</b> and previous vehicle travel times as independent variables. In addition to the autoregressive formulation, a duration model is estimated based on the same travel time data. The duration model of travel time provided insights into how one could predict the probability of a car’s duration of time on a roadway segment changed over time. Interestingly, the three duration models estimated (all hours, peak hour and night time models) showed that the point where the conditional probability of travel times becoming longer occurs roughly at the onset of level-of-service F conditions. Finally, a seemingly unrelated regression equation model to predict travel time and travel-time variability is estimated. This model predicts 15 -minute interval travel times and standard deviation of travel time based on speed, volume and time of <b>day</b> <b>indicators.</b> The model has a very good statistical fit and thus can be used in the field to compute real-time travel time using data available from remote traffic microwave sensors...|$|R

40|$|Travel {{time and}} travel time {{reliability}} are important performance measures for assessing traffic condition {{and extent of}} congestion on a roadway. Most commonly used methods to obtain travel time data either produce only estimates of travel times or too few travel time data points for meaningful analysis. This study focuses on using a new probe vehicle technique, the Bluetooth technology, to collect two weeks of travel time data on Interstate- 69 in Indianapolis. These data are then used to estimate econometric models, {{which can be used}} to predict freeway segment travel times. ^ First, an autoregressive model is estimated based on the collected data. Individual vehicle travel times on a freeway segment are expressed as a function of speed, volume, time of <b>day</b> <b>indicators,</b> and previous vehicle travel times. In addition to the autoregressive formulation, a duration model is estimated based on the same travel time data. The duration model enables calculation of the probability of the vehicle exiting the segment of the road at any point in time. The estimated models indicate that the rate of vehicles exiting the segment as a function of their travel time rises initially until the inflection point and then decreases. It is hypothesized that the inflection point occurs at the onset of congestion, when longer travel time may not result in a higher probability of exiting the freeway segment. Lastly, a seemingly unrelated regression equation model to predict travel time and intervehicle variability is proposed. This model predicts 15 -minute interval travel time and the standard deviation of travel time based on speed, volume and time of <b>day</b> <b>indicators.</b> The estimated model shows a good fit with the data. Furthermore, the results indicate that it is superior to the model based on point-speed estimates, which is commonly used in practice. Thus, the SURE model can be used to improve real-time travel time prediction. ...|$|R

40|$|Increased inputs of {{nutrients}} and acid anions to oligotrophic mountain lakes {{are contributing to}} ANC depression, elevated nitrate concentrations, shifts in nutrient limitation, {{and changes in the}} productivity and structure of aquatic communities. A need for stricter standards based on measurable ecological effects has been identified as an important step toward the long-term protection of mountain lakes. The objectives of this research were to link atmospheric deposition with acidification and eutrophication effects, develop critical loads and nutrient criteria, and assess status and trends of Sierra Nevada lakes. Investigation of multiple proxies of deposition, climate, acidification, and eutrophication indicated that early 20 th century ANC decline in a Sierra Nevada lake is attributed to atmospheric deposition and the subsequent recovery in the late 20 th century is attributed {{to the success of the}} Clean Air Act. Correlation analysis indicated ANC was correlated with atmospheric deposition indicators, but was not correlated with climate measures or productivity proxies. However, analyses looking more broadly across the landscape found a correlation with present <b>day</b> <b>indicators</b> of atmospheric deposition (SCPs) and ANC. These results indicate that not all lakes have fully recovered from acid deposition and stricter regulatory standards are needed. I aimed to link atmospheric deposition indicators with effects of eutrophication and acidification at a landscape scale and found that atmospheric deposition indicators were correlated with acidification, but not with eutrophication. Quantifying the relationship between nitrogen deposition and eutrophication across complex mountain landscapes is presently challenging, leading to the conclusion that critical loads based on acidification are a more robust approach. An acidification critical load was calculated based on 20 th century ANC and acid deposition patterns and is 73. 9 eq ha - 1 yr - 1 for acid anions, which translates to 0. 68 kg-N ha - 1 yr - 1 and 1. 2 kg-SO 4 ha - 1 yr- 1.

Valid accelerometer data was available for 5. 6 (SD= 1. 62) days in average, heart rate data for 6. 5 days, and GPS data was available for 6. 1 (2. 1) <b>days.</b> Spatio-behavioural <b>indicators</b> were shared between patients, parents, and practitioners to support counseling. Conclusion. Use of wearable sensors along with data treatment algorithms and visualisation tools allow to better measure and describe real-life environments, mobility, physical activity, and physiological responses. Increased specificity in lifestyle interventions opens new avenues for remote patient monitoring and intervention...|$|R
40|$|Free time, that is, {{the time}} that remains at one's own {{discretion}} after conducting daily work and personal care activities, has been previously recognized as a ‘primary good’ and an important welfare resource that provides opportunities for participation in social life and leisure. However, recent years have witnessed an increasing preoccupation with the phenomenon of time poverty, drawing attention to the distribution of free time {{and its relationship to}} structural and family circumstances. In this article we propose a novel approach to the measurement of time poverty and document its occurrence amongst British workers. In line with previous literature, a conceptualization of time poverty as a relative lack of free time resources vis-à-vis other members of the community is adopted. However, unlike previous empirical studies, we investigate the differential configuration of time poverty on weekdays and weekend <b>days,</b> alongside <b>indicators</b> of the quality of free time, taking into account insights from theoretical and empirical work within the field of the sociology of time. Our analysis of the 2000 UK Time Use Survey highlights class and gender inequalities that have been missed by previous measurement approaches and demonstrates that, overall, working women experience multiple and more severe free time constraints, which may constitute an additional barrier for their leisure and social participation...|$|R
