5|$|Fares are AR$7.50 per {{trip on the}} Subte, {{though these}} can be as low as AR$4.50 per trip {{depending}} on how many trips are made per month, while the Premetro has a flat rate of AR$1.50. While tokens {{have been used in}} the past, at present, riders use contactless cards called SUBE, which are rechargeable with multiple <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment.</b> Previously, single or multi-use paper cards with a magnetic strip (called Subtepass) were used, however, these were phased out of the system in May 2016, opting instead only to use the digital cards, with the exception of some retired, disabled and student cards. Trains run from 05:00 until 23:00, every 3–4minutes, for all lines except Line H which has a frequency of around 6minutes. Under modernisation plans commenced in 2013, service frequencies are set to increase to an average of one train every 2:20 by 2019.|$|E
25|$|In 675, the Third Council of Braga {{was held}} in Braga (Bracara), Hispania. This Catholic {{conclave}} promulgated eight decrees affecting ritual, the handling of sacred vessels, {{who may or may}} not live with a priest, unacceptable forms of punishment of clergy, and unacceptable <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> of clergy and rectors. In the same year, the Eleventh Council of Toledo was convened in November.|$|E
25|$|Plaintiffs {{allege that}} Visa, MasterCard, and major credit card issuers {{engaged in a}} {{conspiracy}} to fix interchange fees, also known as swipe fees, that are charged to merchants {{for the privilege of}} accepting payment cards at artificially high levels. In their complaint, the plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants unfairly interfere with merchants from encouraging customers to use less expensive <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> such as lower-cost cards, cash, and checks.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, {{the mark}} was {{replaced}} by the Euro; its coins and banknotes remained in circulation, defined in terms of euros, until the introduction of euro notes and coins in early 2002. The Deutsche Mark ceased to be legal tender immediately upon the introduction of the euro — in contrast to the other eurozone nations, where the euro and legacy currency circulated side by side for up to two months. Mark coins and banknotes continued to be accepted as valid <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> in Germany until 28 February 2002.|$|E
25|$|For merchants, {{a credit}} card {{transaction}} is often more secure than other <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment,</b> such as cheques, because the issuing bank commits to pay the merchant the moment the transaction is authorized, {{regardless of whether the}} consumer defaults on the credit card payment (except for legitimate disputes, which are discussed below, and can result in charges back to the merchant). In most cases, cards are even more secure than cash, because they discourage theft by the merchant's employees and reduce the amount of cash on the premises. Finally, credit cards reduce the back office expense of processing checks/cash and transporting them to the bank.|$|E
25|$|In 2012 Northern Bank {{adopted the}} name of its Copenhagen-based parent company Danske Bank Group and rebranded its retail banking operation. In June 2013 the bank issued {{a new series of}} £10 and £20 notes bearing the new brand name; {{at the same time it}} also {{announced}} that it would cease production of £50 and £100 notes. Older notes bearing the Northern Bank name will continue in circulation for some time as they are gradually withdrawn, and remain acceptable <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment.</b> In spite of the Danish name on the new notes, banknotes issued by Danske Bank are sterling notes and should not be confused with banknotes of the Danish krone issued by the Danmarks Nationalbank, Denmark's central bank.|$|E

25|$|At Costco {{stores and}} gas stations, until June 19, 2016, American Express {{was the only}} {{accepted}} credit card in Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, because Amex charged Costco very low interchange fees (a percentage of revenue from total sales made); as Costco's margins are low in comparison to other retailers'. Other <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> accepted at Canadian, United Kingdom, and U.S. Costco locations included cash, Costco Cash Cards, Costco credit cards, checks, EBT cards (both cash and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits), and PIN-based debit cards (Interac in Canada).

2500|$|Other {{courts have}} noted this {{distinction}} in upholding the taxation {{not only of}} wages, but also of personal gain derived from other sources, recognizing some limitation to the reach of income taxation. For example, in Conner v. United States, 303 F. Supp. 1187 (S.D. Tex. 1969), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 439 F.2d 974 (5th Cir. 1971), a couple had lost their home to a fire, and had received compensation for their loss from the insurance company, partly {{in the form of}} hotel costs reimbursed. The court acknowledged the authority of the IRS to assess taxes on all <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment,</b> but did not permit taxation on the compensation provided by the insurance company, because unlike a wage or a sale of goods at a profit, this was not a gain. As the Court noted, [...] "Congress has taxed income, not compensation".|$|E

50|$|Visa and MasterCard {{have created}} a {{specialized}} type <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> card used primarily by government agencies and businesses. Increasingly, corporations and government agencies are relying on this <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> to compensate their service providers and suppliers. Businesses benefit by receiving their funds quickly and by winning competitive bids and government contracts where purchasing cards are the required <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment.</b> The downside, however, is the increased costs associated with receiving these payments. These costs will usually be much higher than accepting a standard consumer credit card.|$|R
