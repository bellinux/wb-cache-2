2500|$|The 'AC Ace-Aigle' was an aerodynamically {{improved}} single-piece AC Ace Bristol based {{vehicle with}} the BEX289 chassis number {{designed specifically for}} the Le Mans 24-hour race in 1960. The inspiration came from the Swiss [...] AC [...] importer Hubert Patthey, {{as was the case}} with 'AC Ace Bristol Zagato' in 1958, but was conceptually much easier. The Aigle Aigle, which has been legally independent in its own right alongside the design studio and car body builder Ghia in Turin existed. In contrast to the standard vehicle, the 'Ace-Aigle' had a modified front and a fixed hardtop. The roof top had two unusual vaults to give the rider and co-driver plenty of headroom - actually the [...] "double bubble" [...] design, typical of Zagato, and implemented in its 1958 coupé. The normal, aerodynamically relatively unfavorable <b>front</b> <b>body</b> of radiator grille, front fenders and bonnet was replaced by a new front and made of lightweight polyester front. This was rounder, ran longer and flatter forward, and had a flat, oval cooling air intake, backlit headlights clad with plexiglas half shells. She remotely recalled the Jaguar E-Type. According to the same concept and with very similar lines, [...] Ghia Aigle [...] had already changed several Austin-Healey Sprite from 1958 to 1961 (albeit without hardtop).|$|E
