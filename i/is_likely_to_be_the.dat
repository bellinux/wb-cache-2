5|$|Based on an {{observed}} excess {{emission of}} infrared radiation, Vega {{appears to have}} a circumstellar disk of dust. This dust <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> result of collisions between objects in an orbiting debris disk, which is analogous to the Kuiper belt in the Solar System. Stars which display an infrared excess due to dust emission are termed Vega-like stars.|$|E

The present Dukes of Buccleuch, Richmond, Grafton and St Albans descend from Charles in unbroken male line. Diana, Princess of Wales, was descended from two of Charles's illegitimate sons: the Dukes of Grafton and Richmond. Diana's son, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, second in line to the British throne, <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first British monarch descended from Charles II.|$|E
25|$|Compared with GABAA, GABAC receptors have {{a higher}} {{affinity}} for GABA, they <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> longer-lasting in activity, and their responses <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> generated by lower GABA concentrations.|$|R

5|$|Killer whales {{have also}} been {{observed}} preying on terrestrial mammals, such as deer swimming between islands off the northwest coast of North America. Killer whale cannibalism has also been reported based on analysis of stomach contents, but this <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> result of scavenging remains dumped by whalers. One killer whale was also attacked by its companions after being shot. Although resident killer whales have never been observed to eat other marine mammals, they occasionally harass and kill porpoises and seals for no apparent reason.|$|E
5|$|The African species' {{breeding}} habitat {{consists of}} forested rivers with islands with sandy shores for breeding. The nesting {{grounds of the}} white-eyed river martin are unknown, but if the breeding habitat resembles that of its relative, it <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> forested valleys of large rivers, which can provide sandbars and islands for nesting, and woodland over which the birds can catch insect prey. The African river martin uses coastal savannah as its winter habitat. Based on its only known wintering site, the non-breeding habitat of the white-eyed {{is assumed to be}} in the vicinity of open fresh water for feeding, with reed-beds for the night-time roost.|$|E
5|$|The SSSI is {{economically}} {{important to}} the area because of the tourists it attracts for birdwatching and other outdoor activities, although sensitive wildlife sites are managed to avoid damage from {{the large numbers of}} visitors. Another threat is the encroachment of the sea on this soft coast. The Environment Agency considers that managed retreat <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> long-term solution, and is working with the Norfolk Wildlife Trust to create new reserves inland to compensate for the loss of scarce habitats at the coast.|$|E

5|$|The Swiss Ornithological Institute {{has set up}} a {{monitoring}} program to record breeding populations of woodland birds. This has shown that deadwood is an important habitat requirement for the black woodpecker, great spotted woodpecker, middle spotted woodpecker, lesser spotted woodpecker, European green woodpecker and Eurasian three-toed woodpecker. Populations of all these species increased by varying amounts in the period 1990 to 2008. During this period, the amount of deadwood in the forest increased and the range of the white-backed woodpecker enlarged as it extended eastwards. With the exception of the green and middle spotted woodpeckers, the increase in the amount of deadwood <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> major factor explaining the population increase of these species.|$|E
5|$|All of the {{discovered}} {{alkali metals}} occur in nature as their compounds: {{in order of}} abundance, sodium is the most abundant, followed by potassium, lithium, rubidium, caesium, and finally francium, which is very rare due to its extremely high radioactivity; francium occurs only in the minutest traces in nature as an intermediate step in some obscure side branches of the natural decay chains. Experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of ununennium (Uue), which <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> next member of the group, but they have all met with failure. However, ununennium {{may not be an}} alkali metal due to relativistic effects, which are predicted to have a large influence on the chemical properties of superheavy elements; even if it does turn out to be an alkali metal, it is predicted to have some differences in physical and chemical properties from its lighter homologues.|$|E
5|$|Progeny of {{two parents}} of {{different}} breeds are termed F1 hybrids, F1 crosses or first crosses. F1 hybrids generally have an extremely uniform phenotype {{and benefit from}} hybrid vigour. These advantages are observed in the breeding {{of a wide variety}} of animals and plants, and arise because progeny inherit one of each paired gene from each parent. When both parents are homozygous for different variants of genes (known as alleles), which <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> case when a breed has been developed and selected over several generations, progeny will inherit both gene variants present in the parents. The F1 hybrid progeny will then be heterozygous for each gene variant, which in turn increases the likelihood that the genes will code for an optimal protein or enzyme. This is the genetic basis of hybrid vigour. While many gene variants have effects that are of little consequence to beef production, a few, such as the myostatin variants found in different cattle breeds, have a major effect.|$|E

30|$|Assuming {{traditional}} gender roles, it thus {{follows that}} the combined effect of CLM and education will differ {{for men and}} women. More generally, Predictions 2 and 3 regarding education depend on whether {{men and women are}} predominantly WiHo workers or employers of WiHo. The more they <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on the employer side, the more the combined effect of education and CLM on couple formation <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> negative. The more they <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> WiHo workers, the less CLM <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> affect couple formation of the college-educated.|$|R

5|$|The {{physical}} {{distance between}} the two civilizations has also been {{used to assess the}} cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact. Historical examples show that the greater the distance, the less the contacted civilization perceives a threat to itself and its culture. Therefore, contact occurring within the Solar System, and especially in the immediate vicinity of Earth, <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most disruptive and negative for humanity. On a smaller scale, people close to the epicenter of contact would experience a greater effect than would those living farther away, and a contact having multiple epicenters would cause a greater shock than one with a single epicenter. Space scientists Martin Dominik and John Zarnecki state that {{in the absence of any}} data on the nature of extraterrestrial intelligence, one must predict the cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact on the basis of generalizations encompassing all life and of analogies with history.|$|E
