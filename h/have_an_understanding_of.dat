5|$|As a term, neo {{soul was}} coined by Kedar Massenburg of Motown Records {{in the late}} 1990s as a {{marketing}} category following the commercial breakthroughs of artists such as D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, and Maxwell. The success of D'Angelo's 1995 debut album Brown Sugar has been regarded by several writers and music critics as inspiration behind the term's origin. While some artists have ignored the label, others have received the designation with controversy because it may seem contrived to music audiences and imply that soul music had ended {{at some point in}} time. In a 2002 interview for Billboard, Massenburg said that genre classifications are often unpopular because they may be suggestive of a short-lived trend. However, although he said neo soul is still essentially soul music, Massenburg felt there was a need to market artists of the genre for listeners to <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> what they were buying.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, {{while most}} {{women in the}} United States {{apparently}} {{have a negative view}} of menopause as a time of deterioration or decline, some studies seem to indicate that women from some Asian cultures <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> menopause that focuses on a sense of liberation and celebrates the freedom from the risk of pregnancy. Postmenopausal Indian women can enter Hindu temples and participate in rituals, marking it as a celebration for reaching an age of wisdom and experience.|$|E
25|$|In European {{classical}} music and opera, voices are treated like musical instruments. Composers who write vocal music must <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the skills, talents, and vocal properties of singers. Voice classification {{is the process}} by which human singing voices are evaluated and are thereby designated into voice types. These qualities include {{but are not limited to}} vocal range, vocal weight, vocal tessitura, vocal timbre, and vocal transition points such as breaks and lifts within the voice. Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and vocal registration. The science behind voice classification developed within European {{classical music}} has been slow in adapting to more modern forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within opera to associate possible roles with potential voices. There are currently several different systems in use within classical music including the German Fach system and the choral music system among many others. No system is universally applied or accepted.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, as {{a result}} of social workers' {{training}} in counseling and their experience in helping their clients with accessing benefits such as unemployment insurance and disability benefits, they are particularly well-suited to help individuals and families learn how to become financially self-sufficient. That said, {{there is a need for}} additional training vis a vis social workers in the financial household management arena. Under some conditions, a raise may trigger reductions in several benefits; therefore, it would be beneficial for social workers to study a financial education curriculum tailored for social workers such as financial social work to fully understand and explain the possible ramifications to clients. In addition, social workers often work with low-income or low to middle-income people who are either unbanked (do not have a banking account) or underbanked (individuals who have a bank account but tend to rely on high cost non-bank providers for their financial transactions). Social workers who <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> financial institutions would be able to guide individuals and families to use mainstream financial institutions and thereby hold onto more of their income and spend less on high cost non-bank financial services.|$|E
25|$|A JAG Manual {{investigation}} commenced {{immediately after}} the fire, in accordance with Navy policy. The investigation determined that the initial explosion was caused by overheating of the Zuni rocket by the huffer exhaust. Investigators also determined that although concerns about the exhaust and placement of the huffer were raised by an airman who observed the exhaust, the personnel to whom the concerns were raised were involved in other tasks, and may not have completely understood {{what was being said}} due to the ambient noise on the flight deck; however, the investigators also noted that moving the unit may not have made a difference in whether the initial explosion occurred or not, due to the estimated temperature of the rocket by that time. The investigation also revealed that flight-deck personnel did not <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> ordnance cook-off times, and as a result may not have had an appreciation of the hazards posed by live ordnance on the flight deck. Among the items deemed to have had some sort of impact of firefighting operations were lack of redundancies in communication systems and firefighting system controls and components; lack of communication between the Air Boss, who was responsible for flight and hangar deck firefighting, and the Damage Control Assistant, who was responsible for all other firefighting operations; and overtasking of the fire-main system due to activation of multiple systems at once.|$|E
500|$|The 12-6 elbow {{has often}} been criticized for its brutality, however, the rules prohibiting them have also been criticized. In particular, {{it has been argued}} that the term [...] "downward elbow strikes" [...] is too strict, as it only applies to {{straight}} motions and does not make elbows on an arc illegal. Matt Hume, chief referee of the One Fighting Championship, explained that while 12-6 elbows were illegal, [...] "if you change the time to 11:59, it is no longer illegal." [...] Hume felt that the authors of the Unified Rules did not <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> MMA, with McCarthy affirming that view by stating that Lembo [...] "wasn't a big MMA guy at the time". Hume also argued that the rule meant that other elbow strikes that could gain more velocity than 12-6 elbows were legal yet were hitting with the same point of the elbow.|$|E

[...] In another interview he elaborated further, stating, [...] "It's funny because hits are usually sort of congruent, sort of an identifiable lyric idea, and that song pretty much had none. The chorus lyric is kind of beautiful and easy to remember. Other than that, I sure didn't <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> it after I wrote it.
