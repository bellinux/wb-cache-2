500|$|Bartley recounts {{a revelation}} that Erhard {{said he had}} {{experienced}} in March 1971 while driving into San Francisco, California to work at Grolier Society. Erhard described to Bartley what the revelation experience felt like: [...] "What happened had no form. It was timeless, unbounded, ineffable, beyond language." [...] He told Bartley that he realized: [...] "I had to 'clean up' my life. I had to acknowledge and correct the lies in my life. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lies that I told about others — my wanting my family, or Ellen (his second wife), or anyone else, {{to be different from}} the way that they are -- came from lies that I told about myself -- my wanting to be different from the way that I was." ...|$|E
2500|$|Corgan later {{admitted}} that they switched back to the album format because he [...] "...reached a point where <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> one-song-at-a-time idea had maxed itself out...I just saw we weren't getting the penetration in to everybody that I would have hoped." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "When I {{first heard}} of the [...] Wairau {{massacre}} ... I was exceedingly angry ... My first thought was to revenge the deaths of my friends, and the other Pākehā who had been killed, and for that purpose to bring many ships of war ... with many soldiers; and had I done so, {{you would have been}} sacrificed and your pa destroyed. But when I considered, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Pakeha had in the first instance been very much to blame; and I determined to come down and inquire into all the circumstances and see who was really in the wrong." ...|$|E

2500|$|From a New York Times {{interview}} in 1942: [...] "When the war started... {{felt that it}} was up to me to do something, and the only thing I know is show business. I went around during the last war and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> boys needed something besides chow and drills. I knew the same was true today, so I told the people in Washington that I would go anywhere and do an act for the Army." [...] Shortly after the war began, he wrote a letter to Steven Early, press secretary to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, volunteering [...] "to head a committee for the entertainment of soldiers and said that he [...] "would work without pay... would gladly assist in the organization to be set up for this purpose". A few weeks later, he received his first tour schedule from the newly formed United Services Organization (USO), [...] "the group his letter to Early had helped create".|$|E
2500|$|In his {{unpublished}} autobiography, I Always Had Shoes (portions {{of which}} were later incorporated by Jack's daughter, Joan Benny, into her memoir of her parents, Sunday Nights at Seven), Benny said that he, not NBC, {{made the decision to}} end his TV series in 1965. He said that while the ratings were still very good (he cited a figure of some 18 million viewers per week, although he qualified that figure by saying he never believed the ratings services were doing anything more than guessing, no matter what they promised), advertisers were complaining that commercial time on his show was costing nearly twice as much as what they paid for most other shows, and he had grown tired of what was called the [...] "rate race". Thus, after some three decades on radio and television in a weekly program, Jack Benny went out on top. In fairness, Benny himself shared Fred Allen's ambivalence about television, though not quite to Allen's extent. [...] "By my second year in television, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> camera was a man-eating monster... It gave a performer close-up exposure that, week after week, threatened his existence as an interesting entertainer." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{the king}} of the Franks [...] was on the hill with that band, they made a {{formidable}} charge against the Muslims facing them, so that they drove them back to my father [...] I looked towards him and he was overcome by grief and his complexion pale. He took hold of his beard and advanced, crying out [...] "Give the lie to the Devil!" [...] The Muslims rallied, returned to the fight and climbed the hill. When <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Franks withdrew, pursued by the Muslims, I shouted for joy, [...] "We have beaten them!" [...] But the Franks rallied and charged again like the first time and drove the Muslims back to my father. He acted as he had done on the first occasion and the Muslims turned upon the Franks and drove them back to the hill. I again shouted, [...] "We have beaten them!" [...] but my father rounded on me and said, [...] "Be quiet! We have not beaten them until that tent [...] falls." [...] As he was speaking to me, the tent fell. The sultan dismounted, prostrated himself in thanks to God Almighty and wept for joy.|$|E

60|$|However, {{by giving}} no heed {{to what he}} said, we brought the Avenger into position; but <b>I</b> soon <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tide was setting us away from the Britisher, and {{suggested}} that we let go the anchor.|$|R
60|$|But <b>I</b> soon <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> unless <b>the</b> wind changed, {{the steamer}} would {{probably}} pass within hailing distance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lord Trevorsham!" [...] cried a {{voice in}} great displeasure, and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Halsted, <b>the</b> nearest magistrate, was {{standing}} over us.|$|R

60|$|I protested my {{innocence of}} these things. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> under <b>the</b> mask of these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an {{insulated}} Quakerish Nantucketer, {{was full of}} his insular prejudices, and rather distrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vineyard.|$|R
60|$|Turning my {{eyes from}} this dreadful sight, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> on <b>the</b> {{opposite}} slope, {{where we had}} camped during our southern trek from Delagoa, still stood the huts and wagons of the Reverend Mr. Owen. I asked Kambula whether he and his people were also dead.|$|R
60|$|Now <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> King thought {{me to be}} a {{liar and}} the blood rose to my head.|$|E
60|$|With Pannell up, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Rube held {{in on his}} speed, or else he was tiring. Pannell hit {{the second}} slow ball for two bases. Vane sacrificed, and then the redoubtable Schultz came up. He {{appeared}} to be in no hurry to bat. Then <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> foxy Buffalo players were working to tire the Rube. They had the situation figured. But they were no wiser than old Spears.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{poor girl}} was much agitated, but, true to her Indian training, she laid {{powerful}} constraint on herself.|$|E
60|$|As I crept {{toward them}} {{cautiously}} that I might come {{as near as}} possible before being discovered, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> finally <b>the</b> men appeared to have reached {{some sort of a}} compromise, for with Phaidor's assistance they both set about dragging the resisting Dejah Thoris to the flier's deck.|$|R

60|$|Five {{days later}} he bought a huge, fat, red-backed account-book, and a glass inkstand. Thus <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> coolies had been getting into his debt, and that {{commerce}} was increasing on legitimate lines of credit. Also <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> one basket had grown into three, and that Naboth had backed and hacked into the shrubbery, and made himself a nice little clearing for the proper display of the basket, the blanket, the books, and the boy.|$|E

500|$|I was {{surprised}} I got that call 'cause of our {{differences in the}} audiences we hit, but I'm always up for challenges and trying something new ... She described what her album is about and then she sent me some CDs of what type of stuff's been inspiring her to make the record, and {{it happened to be}} a lot of stuff that I grew up on in the early '70s, 'cause I'm 40. Aretha Franklin, Etta James, Marvin Gaye, Esther Williams, all kinds of different things. Once <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that's</b> <b>the</b> vibe she wanted, I still had to make it sound like the way my beats thump and stuff but still give her the atmosphere she's trying to bring out on the singing side.|$|R
60|$|In {{about an}} hour I made {{out that it was}} {{something}} round, with something white raised above it, and then I discovered that it was a life-preserver, which supported a little stick, to which a white flag, probably a handkerchief, was attached.
