30|$|In particular, {{manganese}} dioxide (MnO 2)-based materials are {{of great interest}} for various applications, ranging from catalysts and batteries to energy-efficient devices and carbon-storage applications [4 – 7]. Mn atoms are multivalent, and thus form oxides with several different stoichiometries [8]. At room temperature and atmospheric pressure, the most stable phase is β-MnO 2, which crystalizes in a pyrolusite (or a rutile) crystal structure, but other metastable phases such as α and γ exist as well [3, 9 – 13]. Song et al. have demonstrated a TE generator that lit up a regular light-emitting diode by using β-MnO 2 powders [12]. He found a <b>giant</b> <b>S</b> coefficient {{in the range of}} 20 – 40  mV/K as a function of particle size and electrical resistance (i.e., 30 [*]−[*] 120  KΩ). This discovery ignited interest in using β-MnO 2 even as the core TE material in a thermopower wave source demonstrated by Ref. [14]. Although the semiconducting properties of MnO 2 are well known (Ref. [11]), not too much is known about the TE properties of this system. In the literature, there are six research groups that reported electrical conductivities and S coefficient values for MnO 2 powders (i.e., Refs. [9 – 14]). However, out of these works, only the Ref. [14] reported thermal conductivity values.|$|R

40|$|We have {{obtained}} spectra {{of the yellow}} <b>giant</b> <b>S</b> 1040 in the open cluster M 67 using the Goddard High-Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS) and the Faint Object Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. S 1040 is a single-lined spectroscopic binary with a 42. 8 d period that occupies a "red straggler" position in the M 67 color-magnitude diagram (CMD), 0. 2 mag blueward of the giant branch. A detection of S 1040 at 1620 A with the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope provided evidence that the secondary is a hot white dwarf, and thus that the anomalous location of S 1040 in the CMD is likely due to a prior episode of mass-transfer. Our GHRS spectrum shows a broad Ly alpha absorption profile that confirms the white dwarf identification of the S 1040 secondary. A model atmosphere fit to the GHRS spectrum yields Teff = 16, 160 K, log g = 6. 7, and a mass of 0. 22 Msun, for an assumed cluster distance of 820 pc and reddening of E(B-V) = 0. 02. The unusually low mass derived for the white dwarf implies {{that it must have}} a helium core, and that a mass-transfer episode must have begun while the progenitor was on the lower giant branch. We construct a plausible mass-transfer history for S 1040 in which it originated as a short (~ 2 d) period binary, and evolved through a blue straggler phase to reach its current state.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Ichthyosaurs were an {{important}} group of Mesozoic marine reptiles and existed from the Early Triassic {{to the early}} Late Cretaceous. Despite a great diversity in body shapes and feeding adaptations, all share greatly enlarged eyes, an elongated rostrum with numerous conical teeth, and a streamlined body. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Based on new material from China and the restudy of Shastasaurus pacificus, we here reinterpret the classical large-bodied Late Triassic ichthyosaur genus Shastasaurus to differ greatly from the standard ichthyosaurian body plan, indicating much greater morphological diversity and range of feeding adaptations in ichthyosaurs than previously recognized. Phylogenetic analysis indicates a monophyletic clade consisting of the giant Shonisaurus sikanniensis, Guanlingsaurus liangae, and Shastasaurus pacificus to which the genus name Shastasaurus is applied. Shastasaurus liangae comb. nov. is from the Late Triassic (Carnian) Xiaowa Formation of Guizhou Province, southwestern China. The species combines a diminutive head with an entirely toothless and greatly reduced snout. The species also has by far the highest vertebral count among ichthyosaurs (86 presacral vertebrae and > 110 caudal vertebrae), a count that is also very high for tetrapods in general. A reduced toothless snout and a diminutive head is also apparently present in the <b>giant</b> <b>S.</b> sikanniensis and presumably in S. pacificus. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In analogy to many modern odontocetes, Shastasaurus is interpreted as a specialized suction feeder on unshelled cephalopods and fish, suggesting a unique but widespread Late Triassic diversification of toothless, suction-feeding ichthyosaurs. Suction feeding has not been hypothesized {{for any of the}} other diverse marine reptiles of the Mesozoic before, but in Shastasaurus may be linked to the Late Triassic minimum in atmospheric oxygen...|$|R

Although several species have been implicated with animal kills and water fouling, a common offender was Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. Representative strains of A. flos-aquae bloom in New Hampshire intermittently, in both toxic (aphantoxins) and non-toxic forms. Research has focused on methods of: a) toxin accumulation from natural blooms and laboratory cultivation, b) toxin assay, using the mouse bioassay and a modified fluorometric technique developed for paralytic shellfish poisons, c) toxin characterization and purification, using solvent separation and molecular weight filters, and d) testing active extracts on nerve and muscle preparations to determine the specific sites and modes of action of aphantoxins. Aphantoxin samples were passed through molecular weight filters (10, 000 and 500 daltons), lyophilized and weighed, prior to physiological testing. Microgram quantities of toxin reversibly blocked compound action potentials in amphibian nerves as well as mechanical activity in skeletal muscle. No effect was measured on the transmembrane resting potential or on spontaneous miniature end-place potentials (mepps). Tests on lateral and medial <b>giant</b> <b>s</b> from crayfish gave similar salts. The Na+ dependence of the crayfish preparation was verified. The aphantoxins (4 μg/ml) reversibly blocked intracellular recordings of action potentials with no alteration of the resting potential. Amphibian and crustacean cardiac activity was blocked in diastolic arrest, while bivalve hearts were unaffected at increased dose levels.
