5000|$|It is {{sometimes}} desired to receive signals from transmitters {{which are not}} in the same direction. This can be achieved, for one station at a time, by using a rotator operated by an electric motor to turn the antenna as desired. Alternatively, two or more antennas, each pointing at a desired transmitter and coupled by appropriate circuitry, can be used. To prevent the antennas from interfering with each other, the vertical spacing between the booms must be at least half the wavelength of the lowest frequency to be received (Distance=λ/2). The wavelength of 54 MHz (Channel 2) is 5.5 meters (λ x f = c) so the antennas must be a minimum of 2.25 metres, or about 89 inches apart. It is also important that the cables connecting the antennas to the signal splitter/merger be exactly the same length, to prevent phasing issues, which cause ghosting with analog reception. That is, the antennas might both pick up the same station; the signal from the one with the shorter cable will reach the receiver slightly sooner, supplying the receiver with two pictures slightly offset. There may be phasing issues even with the same length of <b>down-lead</b> cable. Bandpass filters or [...] "signal traps" [...] may help to reduce this problem.|$|E

This sensor includes two interferometric transducers in a serial configuration (Fabry-Perot type for the pressure, including a deformable membrane, and birefringent type for the temperature) and uses spectral modulation encoding techniques to recover at large distances both informations without cross-talk and with a perfect <b>down-lead</b> insensitivity. 1...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{widespread}} {{expectation is}} that superconducting technologies {{will be one of}} the effective technologies to decrease energy loss and improve efficiency in energy grids. Especially, in recent circumstances, applications connecting with renewable energy receive attention. Yamaguchi et al successfully developed 200 m-class superconducting direct current transmission and distribution system (CASER- 2) in Chubu University and carried out the demonstration of this system. On this demonstration, “Peltier Current Lead (PCL) ” was employed, wherein Peltier device was used for the purpose of pumping up the heat through the <b>down-leads,</b> It was observed that PCL reduced heat leak into cryostat as compared to usual Cu current leads on this demonstration, but some issues to be solved remained, such as heat-cycle performance etc [...] In this paper, we designed a prototype PCL for the purpose of improvement of the mechanical strength and the durability for the heat cycle, and evaluated the performance...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{description}} of a new type of fiber optic magnetic field sensor based on spectral modulation encoding techniques. This device uses a Faraday magneto-optic element as transducer and converts the rotation of the plane of polarization of the light induced by the magnetic field into a small change in the large optical path difference provided by a birefringent coding plate. The use of a broadband source and of an interferometric detector, with an optical path difference matched to the sensor one, allows to reach high resolution and perfect <b>down-lead</b> insensitivity. A dual-wavelength arrangement is proposed to determine the temperature and magnetic fied values with the same probe. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Power {{transformer}} {{is the key}} {{equipment in}} power system. In view of {{the issues of the}} current bushing monitoring method, a new detection method of bushing insulation defects is proposed in this paper. According to the internal structure of bushing, the internal insulation defects are divided into three categories, including partial moisture, pollution, local insulation defects, the outer insulation of the bushing is equivalent to a resistance chain model. The entire bushing insulation is considered as a parallel between inner insulation and external insulation (inner Insulation is the main). This detection makes uses of the transient voltage measured from transformer bushing and the transient current measured from the end shield <b>down-lead</b> as the signal source. The reference data dynamically generated is used to diagnosis and distinguish Insulation defects of Transformer bushing, according to the monitoring data of the bushing and the maximum of the reference data, the type of the bushing insulation defect and the severity can be sentenced. A large number of simulation results initially confirmed the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method...|$|E
