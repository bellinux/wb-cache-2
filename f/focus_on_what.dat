5|$|From {{the start}} of his Cairo posting Clarke learned the art of {{deception}} by trial and error. From mistakes during Camilla he learned to <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> he wanted the enemy to do rather than on what he wanted them to think. From another early operation (K-Shell, the spreading of rumours about a new Allied super-shell which eventually petered out after the media picked up the story), he learned the value of conducting deception only when there was a clear objective, rather than because it was possible. From Bastion he discovered the difficulty of running a large deception on a short timescale. From these lessons Clarke evolved his principles of deception.|$|E

According to Turner, “he {{was one of the}} first names on the list. He's in a band that we all mutually respect and we felt like he was a person that understood what we were doing and could maintain a <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> we were trying to attain. But he also has some interesting facets of his own musical personality that we thought would blend well with our style.” Wavering Radiant, Isis' 2009 final album, features Adam Jones, also of Tool, as a guest musician.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} human {{security}} has developed {{out of the}} precepts put forth by the United Nations, wherein there has been critique of Human Security's <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> is deemed acceptable behaviors. Human security perspectives view practices such as child marriage and female genital mutilation {{as a threat to}} human (more specifically women) security and well-being in the Global North, while it is more common that these events occur predominately in the Global Southern states. Thus it is seen by states with a traditional human security outlook, to see it as their duty to intervene and perpetuate this eurocentric ideal of what human security looks like, and what is best to protect the familiar concept of women. This can be seen as an infringement on the traditional practices found within some sovereign states of the Global South, and a threat to ways of life and processes of development.|$|E

25|$|In 2011, Counseling at the Crossroads: The {{perspectives}} and promise {{of school counselors}} in American education, the largest survey {{of high school and}} middle school counselors in the United States (over 5,300 interviews), was released by the College Board's National Office for School Counselor Advocacy, the National Association of Secondary School Principals, and the American School Counselor Association. The study shared school counselors' views on educational policies, practices, and reform, and how many of them, especially in urban and rural school settings, are not given the chance to <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> they were trained to do, especially career and college access counseling and readiness for all students, in part due to high caseloads and inappropriate tasks that take up too much of their time. School counselors made strong suggestions about their crucial role in accountability and success for all students and how school systems need to change so that school counselors can be key players in student success. Implications for public policy and district and school-wide change are addressed. The National Center for Transforming School Counseling at The Education Trust released a brief, Poised to Lead: How School Counselors Can Drive Career and College Readiness, challenging all schools to utilize school counselors for equity and access for rigorous courses for all students and ensuring college and career access skills and competencies be a major focus of the work of school counselors K-12.|$|E

[...] Jack also explained that they aspired to invoke an innocent childishness without any intention of irony or humor. Spin magazine commented that [...] "his songs—about getting married in cathedrals, walking to kindergarten, and guileless companionship—are performed with an almost naive certitude." [...] Other affectations included Jack using two microphones onstage.|$|E
500|$|Before Eastman finishes, however, he enumerates {{several things}} that Hazlitt did {{formulate}} in an original manner. Besides such memorable expressions as [...] "It is we who are Hamlet", Hazlitt, like no critic before him, was supremely attentive to [...] "the whole interrelationship {{of one person}} with another, one mind with other minds—presences both physical and psychological upon a stage." [...] With this <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> Hazlitt {{had to say about}} Shakespeare's stagecraft and the way his plays were acted, Eastman thus rescued him from the opprobrium of being associated, in the most superficial way, with the [...] "character" [...] critics. Differing from his contemporaries Lamb and Coleridge, [...] "Hazlitt [...] brings to Shakespeare both a drama critic's sense of the plays as theatre and a closet critic's sense that the theatre of the mind so far surpasses that of the stage that certain of the plays can only be acted there." ...|$|E

Slovak met future bandmates Anthony Kiedis, Flea, and Jack Irons while {{attending}} high school in Los Angeles. He joined the group Anthym along with Irons while attending Fairfax High School; Flea would later join the group, which later changed its name to What Is This?. [...] Slovak, Flea, Kiedis, and Irons started Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1982, which became popular in the Los Angeles area, playing various shows around the city. However, Slovak quit the band to <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>What</b> is This?, which had gotten a record deal, leaving the Red Hot Chili Peppers to record their debut album without him. He rejoined the Chili Peppers in 1985, and recorded the albums Freaky Styley and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan with the band.|$|E

In his opinion, the accompanying song should <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> a child wants—to be free—and be told from the first-person perspective instead of [...] "Kholo Kholos second person. When Khan took over as director, he opted to use [...] "Mera Jahan"—a song written by Gupte—and moved [...] "Kholo Kholo" [...] to the art fair. Viewers of test screenings were divided over the truancy scene. Half thoroughly enjoyed it but the rest complained {{that it was too}} long, did not make sense, and merely showed [...] "touristy" [...] visuals of Mumbai.

[...] According to Stylus Magazine reviewer Todd Burns, Taking Back Sunday [...] "smooth away all of the interesting bits and only <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> works immediately and viscerally," [...] providing [...] "cheap thrills and obvious answers." [...] Edna Gundersen of USA Today wrote that the group [...] "cobbled together a host of emo clichés" [...] to create a record that is [...] "miraculously, more winsome than generic." [...] Despite some [...] "bittersweet confessional" [...] songs which [...] "resort to tired teen-angst whines," [...] "an arresting tug-of-war between raw emotions and charged rhythms" [...] pushes the band beyond [...] "the everyday emo-rock ensemble." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{an almost}} four-month delay, Oblivion went gold on March 2, 2006 and was {{released}} for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 on March 21, 2006. Early rumors notwithstanding, Oblivion shipped on a single DVD-DL disc. One journalist voiced concern for the game's release date, as it was set in the same week as that of EA's [...] Hines dismissed the suggestion, saying, [...] "We tend to <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> we can control {{and not worry about}} what we can't control. Given the level of interest and the number of pre-orders and so forth, we had a pretty good idea we'd be just fine no matter what else was happening that week." [...] Oblivion was the first RPG title to be released for Microsoft's Xbox 360 console. In addition to the standard release version, a Collector's Edition was released for both Windows and Xbox 360 which includes the 112-page Pocket Guide to the Empire, a bonus DVD containing concept art, renders, and an approximately 45-minute-long documentary on the making of Oblivion, and a coin replica of the in-game currency of Tamriel. Its suggested release price of US$69.99 brought back [...] "memories of game prices circa the Nintendo 64" [...] for one Kotaku commentator. Some suggested that the included coin be used to create a [...] "garish piece of jewelry".|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of {{recording}} The Joshua Tree, the band twice paused to participate in benefit concerts. On 17 May 1986, U2 performed at Self Aid in Dublin. Intended to help alleviate Ireland's unemployment crisis by raising funds and job pledges, the event was harshly criticised in the media for taking pressure off the Irish government to resist Margaret Thatcher's economic policies. The band in particular were labelled hypocrites for their participation. Their appearance included a cover of Bob Dylan's [...] "Maggie's Farm", reinterpreted as a criticism of Thatcher. Hot Press Niall Stokes called their performance [...] "the blackest and most ferocious set of their entire career". In June 1986, U2 embarked on the six-show Conspiracy of Hope tour for Amnesty International, halting the album's recording sessions for about two months. Rather than distract the band, the tour invigourated their new music and provided extra <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> they wanted to say. For Clayton, the tour validated the [...] "rawness of content" [...] and their attempts to capture the [...] "bleakness and greed of America under Ronald Reagan". The band used soundchecks on the tour to test out various guitar compositions they had. Meegan believed that U2's time with the other artists on the tour affected their own sound: [...] "Their musical heroes were bleeding into the music and they weren't embarrassed by it, which gave {{them a lot of}} space to work in." ...|$|E
