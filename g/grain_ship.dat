2500|$|There {{was some}} initial {{resistance}} to the MAC concept, in particular through concerns about operating aircraft from short, relatively slow ships. [...] The Admiralty considered that a flight deck length of [...] was needed for safe take-offs and landings and a speed of 15kn. to provide a sufficient margin over convoy speeds and they were especially doubtful that tankers, with their low freeboards and volatile cargoes, could be utilised. [...] As the U-boat situation worsened, however, such concerns were out-weighed by the urgent need to provide convoy air support, and once it was accepted that the <b>grain</b> <b>ship</b> variant at least {{could be made to}} work, the Admiralty became more enthusiastic about the project.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{significant}} difference between the <b>grain</b> <b>ship</b> and tanker MACs was the provision of hangar space within the grain ships.

[...] An elevator platform could lift a fully loaded aircraft from hangar to deck level in less than a minute. [...] It was impracticable to fit tanker MACs with a hangar as this would have entailed very extensive structural alterations and a significant reduction in cargo capacity. [...] Although capable of operating four aircraft, tanker MACs normally embarked three, which all had to be kept on deck: [...] parked aircraft had to be moved to the forward end when other aircraft were landing on, and a collapsible safety barrier was fitted to prevent collisions.

25|$|The Carthaginians were blockading {{the harbor}} of Syracuse with {{a fleet of}} triremes which greatly outnumbered the sixty ships of Agathocles had manned.

Meanwhile, the <b>grain</b> <b>ships</b> entered the port and brought welcome relief to the city, were food was already becoming scarce. The Greek fleet was almost overtaken by the Carthaginians, but was saved when night set in, making further pursuit impossible.

2500|$|The new-build <b>grain</b> <b>ship</b> MACs {{were based}} on the Ministry of War Transport's {{standard}} tramp hull which could just accommodate the Admiralty's revised requirement for a flight deck of not less than [...] length and [...] breadth: they were eventually built with flight decks of between [...] [...] The standard design used for the new-build tankers enabled a longer flight deck of approximately [...] with minor variations between individual ships. [...] An important enhancement was specified for the MACs' machinery. [...] A standard diesel tramp engine developed [...] to give a service speed of 11kn. but to provide some margin for flying operations, all the new-build MACs were fitted with engines rated at [...] which, in the grain ships, produced a speed of about 12kn. [...] The new-build tankers with their higher displacements were still capable of 11kn. while the pre-existing 'Triple Twelves' had a service speed of about 10.5kn. [...] The most obvious modification was the flight deck and its supporting structure which was arranged in sections (three on the grain ships; four in the case of tankers) with expansion joints between each. [...] The flight deck was built at the level that would normally have been occupied by the wheelhouse and in the 'Triple Twelves' this entailed removal of the existing wheelhouse and the funnel. [...] The space immediately under the flight deck was utilised for the arrester gear mechanisms, four wires to each MAC with an additional unit fitted to the tankers to operate the trickle wire and safety barrier. [...] A small island structure contained the bridge and wheelhouse and, in the tanker MACs, a chartroom that {{could be used as a}} pilots' briefing room. Less apparent modifications included; accommodation for 107 crew (about 50 more than normal); improved internal subdivision; additional ventilation, including exhaust arrangements that could be adjusted to vent to the leeward side; changes to lifeboat positions; and magazines for the safe stowage of bombs, depth charges, ammunition and pyrotechnics. [...] There were minor variations between the types. [...] In the grain MACs, [...] the armament sponsons or 'zarebas' could not project outboard of the moulded line of the hull which necessitated them encroaching onto the flight deck area so that the ship would not be prevented from using commercial berths, but this constraint did not apply to the tankers whose zarebas were extended outboard of the side. [...] One centre cargo tank in each tanker was adapted for the carriage of aircraft fuel (or 'Avgas') but in the grain ships this necessitated a special compartment containing two pressurised fuel tanks, together with a control room and associated piping.|$|E

50|$|Merchant {{aircraft}} carriers or MAC ships superseded the CAM ships. Their role was defensive in {{protection of the}} convoys. Unlike the CAM ships, they carried a flight deck so the aircraft were able to land again. The merchant air carriers were adapted standard <b>grain</b> <b>ships</b> or oil tankers. The <b>grain</b> <b>ships</b> had a flight deck of 413 ft to 424 ft ft and a breadth of 62 ft. A hangar on the lower deck was equipped with a lift to the flight deck and accommodated four Fairey Swordfish aircraft. The oil tankers had longer flight decks - 461 ft - but no hangars. Three Swordfish reconnaissance planes were stowed at the aft end of the flight deck.|$|R

50|$|The Maldon grain riots {{took place}} in January 1629, {{in the midst of}} {{industrial}} depression and poor harvests. The English cloth trade had slumped in January, leading to more pressure on agriculture to satisfy export demand. Starvation and high food prices in Essex only exacerbated the strain on the agrarian economy. Discontent was thus harboured when those starving in Essex watched grain being loaded on to ships to be exported to Europe. In March of that year, a 100- to 140-strong group of rioters led by one “Captain” Ann Carter, the wife of a butcher, boarded a Flemish <b>grain</b> <b>ship.</b> There was a widespread belief at the time that women were beyond the law, since any prosecution could only be made against a male who might lie behind a crime; it was commonplace for a husband to be held legally accountable for the actions of his wife (refer to Legal rights of women in history).
