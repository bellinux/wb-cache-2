Methods: The researches were grounded on simulation of acoustic radiation energy at change <b>of</b> mechanically treated <b>composite</b> <b>material</b> properties dispersion for the mechanical model of its surface layer destruction. The data processing with definition of acoustic radiation statistical energy parameters was conducted. The analysis of acoustic emission energy parameters sensitivity to change <b>of</b> <b>composite</b> <b>material</b> properties dispersion, and as the analysis <b>of</b> influencing <b>of</b> <b>composite</b> <b>material</b> properties dispersion on AE amplitude and energy parameters was conducted. Results: Were obtained that at decreasing <b>of</b> <b>composite</b> <b>material</b> properties dispersion there is increasing an average level of acoustic radiation energy and value of its deviation. Is determined, that at decreasing <b>of</b> <b>composite</b> <b>material</b> properties dispersion the greatest increasing there is an acoustic emission energy average level dispersion.
