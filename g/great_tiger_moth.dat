50|$|After 1936, {{the gradual}} rate of {{acceleration}} of <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moth</b> manufacturing {{had reached the}} point where production capacity became finally able to exceed the demands from military customers alone. By the outbreak of the Second World War, a total of 1,424 <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moths</b> had been completed by both domestic and overseas manufacturing efforts. In 1941, de Havilland transferred principal manufacturing activity for the <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moth</b> from its Hatfield factory to Morris Motors Limited at their facility in Cowley, Oxford. In 1945, all activity on the British <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moth</b> production lines was terminated; by this point, Morris Motors had completed a total of 3,433 <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moths.</b>|$|R
50|$|One of the {{excursions}} {{involves a}} race between {{one or more}} steam locomotives and one or more de Havilland <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moth.</b> In 2010 a triple parallel of 3265, 3642 and 3526 was organised taking months of planning. The locomotives raced against three <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moths</b> and winner of the race was the oldest loco in the race, 3265. A <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moth</b> eventually won {{the race for the}} first time in 2012. In 2016, the race was between four train and four <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moths.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{agreeable}} <b>tiger</b> <b>moth</b> (Spilosoma congrua) is one {{of three}} species of white <b>tiger</b> <b>moth</b> which are common in the United States. It has pronounced black eyes, white abdomen, and orange [...] "bib" [...] which set it apart from its cousin the Virginia <b>tiger</b> <b>moth.</b> Like its cousin, it tents its wings when at rest.|$|R
50|$|The RAF ordered 35 dual-control <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moth</b> Is {{which had}} the company {{designation}} DH 82. A subsequent order was placed for 50 aircraft powered by the de Havilland Gipsy Major I engine (130 hp) which was the DH 82A or to the RAF <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moth</b> II. The <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moth</b> entered service at the RAF Central Flying School in February 1932. During the pre-war years increasing numbers of <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moths</b> were procured for the RAF and by overseas customers; by 1939, nearly 40 flying schools operating the type had been established, nine of which operated civil-registers models as well.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moth</b> {{had been}} {{often used as}} a {{stand-in}} for rarer aircraft in films, sometimes having been extensively modified to outwardly resemble the aircraft it was depicting. A trio of aircraft were converted by Croydon-based Film Aviation Services Ltd {{for use in the}} filming of the 1962 movie Lawrence of Arabia; one <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moth</b> became a replica of a Fokker D.VII while two aircraft resembled the Rumpler C.V to depict these types for the film. Several <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moth</b> were used in the crash scenes in The Great Waldo Pepper, standing in for the Curtiss JN-1. Due to the popularity of the design and the rising cost of flyable examples, a number of replicas (scale and full-size) have been designed for the homebuilder, including the Fisher R-80 <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moth</b> and the RagWing RW22 <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moth.</b>|$|R
5|$|The school began {{replacing}} its <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moths</b> with CAC Wackett Trainers in January 1942. No.11 EFTS absorbed No.3 EFTS's instructors, {{students and}} Wackett Trainers in April, {{shortly before the}} latter unit disbanded. The same month at Benalla, thirty-two United States Army Air Corps pilots undertook four weeks of flying in the Wacketts. On 5September 1942, one of the Wacketts crashed after apparently stalling on takeoff, killing the trainee and seriously injuring the pilot. The Wackett Trainers were taken out of service for upgrades in February 1943, and the school again began operating <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moths.</b> One pilot was killed and another seriously injured when their <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moths</b> collided shortly after takeoff on 15June. On 7July, one of the <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moths</b> crashed during a night-flying exercise just east of Benalla, killing both pilots. Another <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moth</b> and its pilot were lost in a crash west of Benalla on 20October 1943. On 14May 1944, a pilot was killed and a trainee seriously injured when their <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moth</b> spun out of control during an instrument test north of Benalla.|$|R

50|$|Hypercompe permaculata, the many-spotted <b>tiger</b> <b>moth,</b> is a <b>tiger</b> <b>moth</b> of {{the family}} Erebidae and {{one of more than}} 80 species of Hypercompe. It is native to the western United States and parts of {{northern}} Mexico.|$|R
5000|$|Numerous {{examples}} of the <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moth</b> are still flying today (an estimated 250). The number of airworthy <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moths</b> has increased as previously neglected aircraft (or those previously only used for static display in museums) have been restored.|$|R

5000|$|On 15 May 1977, {{during the}} annual International Air Fair, a Bell 206 {{helicopter}} {{was in a}} mid-air collision with a de Havilland <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moth</b> at the airport. The <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moth</b> landed but the Bell 206 crashed, killing all five on board.|$|R
50|$|Many <b>tiger</b> <b>moths</b> produce {{ultrasonic}} clicks {{in response}} to the echolocation calls bats use while attacking prey. For most species of <b>tiger</b> <b>moth</b> these clicks warn bats that the moths have toxic compounds that make them distasteful. However, the <b>tiger</b> <b>moth</b> Bertholdia trigona produces clicks at a very high rate (up to 4,500 per second) to jam bat echolocation. Jamming is the most effective defense against bats ever documented, with jamming causing a ten-fold decrease in bat capture success in the field.|$|R
40|$|Lepidopterism is {{a disease}} caused by the urticating scales and toxic fluids of adult moths, {{butterflies}} or its caterpillars. The resulting cutaneous eruptions and systemic problems progress to clinical complications sometimes leading to death. High incidence of fever epidemics were associated with massive outbreaks of <b>tiger</b> <b>moth</b> Asota caricae adult populations during monsoon in Kerala, India. A significant number of monsoon related fever characteristic to lepidopterism was erroneously treated as infectious fevers due to lookalike symptoms. To diagnose <b>tiger</b> <b>moth</b> lepidopterism, we conducted immunoblots for <b>tiger</b> <b>moth</b> specific IgE in fever patients' sera. We selected a cohort of patients (n = 155) with hallmark symptoms of infectious fevers but were tested negative to infectious fevers. In these cases, the total IgE was elevated and was detected positive (78. 6 %) for <b>tiger</b> <b>moth</b> specific IgE allergens. Chemical characterization of caterpillar and adult moth fluids was performed by HPLC and GC-MS analysis and structural identification of moth scales was performed by SEM analysis. The body fluids and chitinous scales {{were found to be}} highly toxic and inflammatory in nature. To replicate the disease in experimental model, wistar rats were exposed to live <b>tiger</b> <b>moths</b> in a dose dependant manner and observed similar clinico-pathological complications reported during the fever epidemics. Further, to link larval abundance and fever epidemics we conducted cointegration test for the period 2009 to 2012 and physical presence of the <b>tiger</b> <b>moths</b> were found to be cointegrated with fever epidemics. In conclusion, our experiments demonstrate that inhalation of aerosols containing <b>tiger</b> <b>moth</b> fluids, scales and hairs cause systemic reactions that can be fatal to human. All these evidences points to the possible involvement of <b>tiger</b> <b>moth</b> disease as a major cause to the massive and fatal fever epidemics observed in Kerala...|$|R

50|$|By 1952 {{there were}} 38 {{firms in the}} {{business}} in New Zealand, operating 149 aircraft, of which 138 were <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moths.</b> A smattering of higher powered de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beavers were the only modern types. By 1956 there were 182 aerial topdressing <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moths</b> but it was obvious the lightweight <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moths</b> {{would need to be}} replaced. At the beginning of the 1950s there were no specialist designs for even crop dusters, due to the proliferation of World War II surplus trainers. But for topdressing something larger and more robust was needed.|$|R
50|$|From 1937 onwards, the <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moth</b> {{was made}} {{available}} to general flying clubs, production having been previously occupied by military customers. The type was quickly used to replace older aircraft in the civil trainer capacity, such as the older de Havilland Cirrus Moth and Gipsy Moth. By {{the start of the}} Second World War, the RAF had around 500 <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moths</b> in service. In addition, nearly all civilian-opeated <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moths</b> throughout the Commonwealth were quickly impressed into their respective air forces {{in order to meet the}} strenuous wartime demand for trainer aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moth</b> {{might be}} {{confused}} {{at first glance}} with the Belgian-designed Stampe SV.4 aerobatic aircraft which had a very similar design layout; both aircraft made use of a similar main landing gear configuration, a slightly sweepback wing, and an alike engine/cowling design. Several <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moths</b> were converted during the 1950s to a Coupe standard, which involved the installation of a sliding canopy over both crew positions, not unlike the Canadian-built Fleet Finch biplane trainers which had worked beside the <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moth</b> in RCAF service as trainers in Canada during the type's wartime years.|$|R
50|$|The {{starting}} point for the <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moth</b> was in fact the successful Gypsy Tiger. Successively more capable engines had been developed and the company had produced a prototype to test the new de Havilland Gipsy III engine. This prototype, a low-wing monoplane was initially a modification of the standard Gypsy Tiger; it later became the first aircraft to be referred to as the <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moth.</b> Improvements made upon the <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moth</b> monoplane were first incorporated into a military trainer variant of the de Havilland DH.60 Moth, designated as the DH.60T Moth - in later parlance, the T came to stand for 'Tiger' in addition to 'Trainer'. According to aviation author A.J. Jackson, development of the standard <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moth</b> version from the monoplane prototype had proceeded relatively straightforward after this point.|$|R
