25|$|Turkish Air Force The Turkish Air Force has 6 MQ-1 Predators {{on order}} via the USA's Foreign Military Sales mechanism. The Turkish Air Force also {{operates}} 3 MQ-1 Predator systems on lease from the US as a stop gap measure as of 2011. The leased MQ-1s are under Turkish command (UAV Base <b>Group</b> <b>Command)</b> but {{operated by a}} joint Turkish-US unit.|$|E
25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the system was also influenced by personal and inter-group rivalries within the RAF command, particularly between 11 Group and 12 Groups whose commanders constantly bickered. Trafford Leigh-Mallory, commander of 12 Group, had originally been slated to take over 11 <b>Group</b> <b>command</b> but it went to Keith Park instead. Leigh-Mallory felt further slighted by Dowding because 12 Group had to defend 11 Group airfields while 11 Group attacked the Germans.|$|E
25|$|At 18:30 the {{sighting}} was {{relayed to}} {{the headquarters of}} Alfred Saalwächter, Commander-in-Chief of Kriegsmarine <b>Group</b> <b>Command</b> West. The information was then passed to Carl-Heinz Birnbacher, commander of 1. Schnellbootflottille (1st Fast Attack Boat Flotilla) in Cherbourg. S-20, S-21, S-25 and S-27 (commanded by Siegfried Wuppermann, Götz Freiherr von Mirbach, Bernd Klug and Hermann Büchting) were ordered to readiness. The British ordered four Motor Torpedo Boats (MTBs) from Dover Command eastwards, to reconnoitre German movements among the French Channel ports. The MTBs sighted the German boats but did not engage, considering their mission was one of reconnaissance. Birnbacher suspected a trap took a position off Beachy Head and Newhaven and at 02:00 on 8 August, the attack began.|$|E

25|$|The Eighth Army {{was formed}} from the Western Desert Force in September 1941, {{under the command}} of Lieutenant-General Sir Alan Cunningham. Over time the Eighth Army would be {{commanded}} by Neil Ritchie, Claude Auchinleck, Bernard Montgomery, Oliver Leese and Richard McCreery. In {{the early years of the}} war Eighth Army suffered from poor leadership and repeated reversals of fortune until the Second Battle of El Alamein when it advanced across Libya into Tunisia and joined the First Army in the 18th Army Group. The Eighth Army, under 15th Army <b>Group</b> <b>command,</b> later took part in the Allied invasion of Sicily, the Allied invasion of Italy and the Italian Campaign, where progress was slow and casualties were heavy.|$|E
25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War Gort was given command of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France, arriving on 19 September 1939. During this time he played a part in a political scandal, the Pillbox affair, that led to the dismissal of War Minister Leslie Hore-Belisha. Following the Phoney War, the 1940 German breakthrough in the Ardennes split the Allied forces and communications between the BEF and the French broke down, and on 25 May 1940 Gort took the unilateral decision to abandon his orders for a southward attack by his forces. Gort's command position was difficult, serving under French high theatre and army <b>group</b> <b>command,</b> while also being responsible to London. Withdrawing northwards, most of the BEF, together with many French and Belgian soldiers, were evacuated during the Battle of Dunkirk and the evacuation to England.|$|E
25|$|Rundstedt rose {{steadily}} {{in the small}} 100,000-man army (the Reichswehr) allowed to Germany by the Versailles Treaty. In May 1920 he was made {{chief of staff to}} the 3rd Cavalry Division, based in Weimar, thus achieving his early ambition of being a cavalry commander. He was promoted to lieutenant-colonel (Oberstleutnant) in 1920, and to full colonel in 1923, when he was transferred to Wehrkreis II, based in Stettin. In 1926 he was made chief of staff to <b>Group</b> <b>Command</b> (Gruppenkommando) 2, which covered the whole of western Germany and was based in Kassel, and promoted to major general (Generalmajor). In 1928 Rundstedt finally left staff positions behind him and was made commander of the 2nd Cavalry Division, based in Breslau. This was considered a front-line posting, given Germany's tense relations with Poland and the fact that Poland at this time had a much bigger army than Germany.|$|E

500|$|This {{information}} was simultaneously {{sent to the}} headquarters of each Group where it was cross-checked through a filter room before being sent through to another operations room, housed in an underground bunker. Because Group had tactical control of the battle, the operations room was different in layout from the main Headquarters at Bentley Priory. The main map on the plotting table represented the <b>Group</b> <b>command</b> area and its associated airfields. Extensive radio and telephone equipment transmitted and received a constant flow of information from the various sector airfields {{as well as the}} Observer Corps, AA Command and the navy. The [...] "Duty fighter controller" [...] was the Group GOC's personal representative and was tasked with controlling how and when each raid would be intercepted.

500|$|From 1921 to 1939 in Transylvania Inspectorate General of Army no. 3 had {{subordinate}} the 6th and 7th Army Corps. By 1 April 1921, when he disbanded Forces Western Command, {{to order}} 6th Army Corps (and earlier structures) have been generals Prezan Constantin, Constantin Christescu Traian Mosoiu, Mardarescu George, Nicholas and Arthur Văitoianu et al. After 1 April 1921 to 23 March 1939, C. 6 A. {{was commissioned by}} General Nicholas Petal, Danila Pop Hanzu Alexander, John Prodan, Motas Dumitru Gheorghe Florescu and Christie Doe, prominent military leaders, whom Octavian Goga wrote that [...] "in the interwar period, in Cluj in Transylvania, commanders have made a large-scale opera and unanimous praise. [...] " [...] Three divisions were part of 6th Army Corps: 16th (Dej), 17th (Oradea) and 20th Infantry Divisions (Targu-Mureş). With rapid and marked worsening international situation, especially in neighboring Romania, on 22 September 1939, the 4th Army, recently founded, became Army <b>Group</b> <b>Command</b> no. 1 of Transylvania.|$|E
500|$|An {{hour after}} the Swordfish attack, Lütjens {{transmitted}} the following signal to Naval <b>Group</b> <b>Command</b> West: [...] "Ship unable to manoeuvre. We will fight to the last shell. Long live the Führer." [...] At 08:47 the following morning, the battleship [...] opened fire, followed directly by [...] Bismarck replied three minutes later, though at 09:02 a 16inch shell from Rodney destroyed the forward turrets. Half an hour later, Bismarcks rear turrets were silenced as well. At around 10:15, both British battleships had ceased fire, their target a burning wreck. The British were running dangerously low on fuel, but Bismarck {{had not yet been}} sunk. The cruiser [...] fired several torpedoes into the crippled ship, which then took on a severe list to port. At approximately the same time as Dorsetshires attack, engine room crew detonated scuttling charges in the engine rooms. There is still significant debate as to the direct cause of Bismarcks sinking. Only 110 men were rescued by the British before reports of U-boats forced them from the scene. A further five men were rescued by German vessels.|$|E

By mid-September, the 6th Army Group, advancing from the south, {{came into contact with}} Bradley's formations advancing from the west and overall control of Devers' force passed from AFHQ in the Mediterranean so that all three army groups came under Eisenhower's central command at SHAEF (Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Forces).|$|R

She carried US Army troops and equipment from Naples, Italy, and unloaded them on the beach near Cape Lardier. Shortly afterward the LST joined Training <b>Group</b> <b>Command,</b> Atlantic Fleet, and operated along the east and gulf coasts until early in 1945. On 10 February 1945, she departed Gulfport, Mississippi, for the Canal Zone en route to duty with the Pacific Fleet. Steaming via Pearl Harbor and Eniwetok, she arrived Saipan 25 April. For the next four months the ship carried men and equipment between Saipan and Okinawa, making occasional calls at Tinian and Guam.

His command lasted from August 30, 1943 until November 3, 1944, when {{he was promoted to}} Air Officer. This change moved him out of the air group and into the ship's complement of officers.

2500|$|Dowding {{transferred}} to No. 6 Squadron in October 1914 and then, {{after two weeks}} as a staff officer in France, became a Flight Commander, first with No. 9 Squadron and then with No. 6 Squadron. He became commanding officer of the Wireless Experimental Establishment at Brooklands in March 1915 {{and went on to}} be commanding officer of No. 16 Squadron in July 1915. After the Battle of the Somme, Dowding clashed with General Hugh Trenchard, the commander of the RFC, over the need to rest pilots exhausted by non-stop duty. In September 1915 the author Duncan Grinnell-Milne joined No 16 squadron as a junior pilot. Years later he published an account of his time in the squadron, in which he criticises Dowding as [...] being [...] "too reserved and aloof from his juniors", although efficient. Promoted to major on 30 December 1915, Dowding was recalled to England in January 1916, and, having been promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel on 1 February 1916 was given command of 7 Wing at Farnborough later that month. He {{transferred to}} the command of 9 wing at Fienvillers in June 1916. Returning to England, he was promoted to temporary colonel on 1 January 1917 on appointment as commander of the Southern <b>Group</b> <b>Command</b> and promoted to temporary brigadier-general on 23 June 1917 before being given command of the southern training brigade in August 1917.
