500|$|The {{election}} {{took place}} on 13 December 2011 and comprised a secret ballot of the thirty-four Labour caucus members, meaning a candidate had to receive the support of eighteen MPs to win. Shearer was elected the party leader, Robertson the deputy leader, Chris Hipkins the senior whip and Darien Fenton the junior whip. Upon election, Shearer stated, [...] "I am a fresh face for Labour and <b>I</b> <b>represent</b> a fresh start for New Zealand." [...] Espiner reported that Shearer received about twenty-two of the thirty-four votes for the leadership position, and a 3 News source claimed a similar number; however, Coatsworth stipulated that the election was secret {{and that she was}} the only person who had access to the ballot papers, which were destroyed.

500|$|Milk's most {{successful}} opponent was the quiet and thoughtful lawyer Rick Stokes, who {{was backed by}} the Alice B. Toklas Memorial Democratic Club. Stokes had been open about his homosexuality long before Milk had, and had experienced more severe treatment, once hospitalized and forced to endure electroshock therapy to 'cure' him. Milk, however, was more expressive {{about the role of}} gay people and their issues in San Francisco politics. Stokes was quoted saying, [...] "I'm just a businessman who happens to be gay," [...] and expressed the view that any normal person could also be homosexual. Milk's contrasting populist philosophy was relayed to The New York Times: [...] "We don't want sympathetic liberals, we want gays to represent gays... <b>I</b> <b>represent</b> the gay street people—the 14-year-old runaway from San Antonio. We have to make up for hundreds of years of persecution. We have to give hope to that poor runaway kid from San Antonio. They go to the bars because churches are hostile. They need hope!

After the game, she stated via Twitter, [...] "When you chant racial slurs, taunt me and talk about my family don't be mad when I shush you and show pride in what <b>I</b> <b>represent.</b> #america." [...] The U.S. Soccer Federation announced that Leroux had [...] "endured abuse both verbally and in social media" [...] since switching to the U.S. national soccer team in 2008; however, Leroux later clarified that no such incidents took place at BMO Field. [...] "My tweet from this morning wasn't in response to anything from yesterday's match at BMO Field. In fact, the atmosphere at the stadium was a positive step forward for women's soccer. Unfortunately, the type of abuse I have received in the past and via social media for my decision to play for the United States is a step backwards.

2500|$|At {{a meeting}} with the French Premier Édouard Herriot on 24 June 1932 during the Lausanne conference, Papen offered him a {{military}} alliance, an [...] "economic union" [...] between their nations and a [...] "consultative pact" [...] where both France and Germany would not take action in foreign policy without consulting each other first; in return Papen wanted an end to reparations, the right to [...] "revise" [...] the border with Poland, an Anschluss with Austria, {{and the end of the}} military restrictions imposed by Versailles. Herriot was cool to this offer, not the least of which was because Papen took an ultra-nationalist line when addressing German audiences, which led him to doubt Papen's sincerity. Papen leaked his offer to Herriot to a French journalist, which was followed by him saying: [...] "France need have no fear about Germany's good faith because unlike Brüning, <b>I</b> <b>represent</b> all of the national [...] forces of Germany". A number of German conservative newspapers in editorials vigorously denied that Papen spoke for them in making an offer of alliance with France.|$|E

Miller opposed the bill and argued {{that the state of}} Michigan should opt out of the National Flood Insurance Program entirely and urged the governor to do so. According to Miller, Michigan residents subsidize other, more flood prone parts of the country, by paying higher premiums than they should. Miller accused insurance premiums of being decides by politics rather than actuarial costs. She said that [...] "too many Americans across this nation are paying rates far below what actual risk would dictate in the marketplace while others, including many who <b>I</b> <b>represent,</b> are being forced to pay into a program that they do not need or want to help subsidize lower rates for other favored groups whose risk is far greater." ...|$|E
