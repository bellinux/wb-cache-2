40|$|Forward osmosis (FO) and {{pressure}} retarded osmosis (PRO) are concentration-driven membrane processes. While {{they can be}} potentially used in water, wastewater, and energy applications, these processes suffer from the concentration polarization inside the porous membrane support resulting in severe flux decrease, a phenomenon known as internal concentration polarization (ICP). Researchers have investigated the effect of ICP both in theoretical and experimental studies. The current study extends the existing ICP model to include the effect of draw solution dilution by membrane permeate flow in a spiral wound FO module (SWFO). FO and PRO experiments were performed using a Hydrowell® SWFO under both submerged and cross-flow conditions. The effect of draw solution concentration, draw solution flow rate, <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> rate, and membrane orientation on FO and PRO water flux performance was systematically investigated. Permeate flow increased with greater draw solution concentration in both FO and PRO modes. ICP was found to drastically limit the available membrane flux in the concentration-driven membrane processes, and its adverse effect was more severe at greater draw solution concentration. Membrane flux was also affected by the dilution of draw solution when the permeate flow rate was comparable or greater than the draw solution flow rate. The submerged FO configuration performed nearly {{as good as the}} cross-flow configuration with feed water circulating outside of the membrane envelope (shorter flow path). In this case, the <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> rate only had limited effect on membrane flux likely due to its low mass transfer resistance. In contrary, the membrane flux can be adversely affected at low <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> rate when it was circulated inside of the membrane envelope (longer flow path). © 2009 Elsevier B.

The Second-Generation PFB Combustion Plant conceptual design prepared in 1987 is being updated to reflect the benefit of pilot plant test data and the latest advances in gas turbine technology. The updated plant is being designed to operate with 95 percent sulfur capture and a single Siemens Westinghouse (SW) 501 G gas turbine. Using carbonizer and gas turbine data generated by Foster Wheeler (FW) and SW respectively, Parsons Infrastructure & Technology prepared preliminary plant heat and material balances based on carbonizer operating temperatures of 1700 and 1800 F and found the former to yield the higher plant efficiency. As a result, 1700 F has been selected as the preferred operating condition for the carbonizer. The 501 G gas turbine has an air compressor discharge temperature of 811 EF and an exhaust temperature of 1140 F. Both of these streams represent high sources of heat and must be cooled, the air to 600 F to be compatible with a 650 F PCFB pressure vessel design temperature and the exhaust for a 275 F stack gas temperature. Because of their relatively high temperature, {{they can be used}} for feed water heating, steam generation and/or steam superheating and reheating. As a result, the plant could have one boiler (the PCFB boiler), or as many as three boilers if their cooling is used to generate steam. If the two streams are used to heat feed water, the <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> must be increased to absorb this heat while staying below the boiling point, and the steam turbine output increases; this decreases both the gas turbine to steam turbine power ratio and plant efficiency.

In this research, a lab scale plate-and-frame permeate gap membrane distillation (PGMD) module with internal heat recovery characteristic is designed. The developed PGMD module performance is experimentally investigated for fresh and saline water feed {{in terms of}} permeate water flux rate, specific thermal energy consumption (STEC) and gained output ratio (GOR). The experimental results show that for a feed sample with 130 (g/kg: ppt) concentration (nearly four times seawater salinity), increasing the feed flow rate from approximately 0. 4 to 1 L/min, led to increasing the distillate flux from 3 to 5 kg/m 2 h.

40|$|The {{operation}} of {{power plants and}} chemical processes requires process measurements for optimal operations. Process measurements are essential for plant performance optimization, process monitoring and process control. It is vital to have reliable and accurate process data to achieve process optimization. However, process measurements are inevitably subject to measurement errors. These measurement errors are classified as random and gross errors. Data reconciliation technique is an effective data treatment method that is used in chemical processes to {{enhance the quality of}} process data. The purpose of data reconciliation is to reduce random errors to achieve measurements which are as accurate and reliable as possible. Data reconciliation technique uses available process measurements to produce consistent and accurate estimates, so close to the true values that they satisfy model constraints. Further, data reconciliation technique depends on measurement redundancy to perform reconciliation and produce reliable estimates. In addition, data reconciliation can also provide estimates of unmeasured observable variables. Process data reconciliation is not complete without a gross error detection strategy that can effectively detect and eliminate gross errors in measurements. Data reconciliation is applied to linear and nonlinear steady state processes with measured and partially measured variables. Heat exchanger and steam generator models with nonlinear mass and energy constraints are used.

Higher water flux rates were achieved by using NF membrane for both types of osmotic agents with changing osmotic agent concentration rates. The best result was obtained through the combination of NF membrane and glucose at lower concentrations and with sucrose at higher concentrations. The NF membrane-sucrose system showed better results for all parameters when changing <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> rate at lower temperatures while the NF-glucose system showed better performance when increasing temperature of the solution. Specific energy consumption increased in all the combinations of membrane-osmotic agent with increasing osmotic agent concentration rates. However, the lowest energy requirements were noted for the combination of NF membrane - glucose as an osmotic agent. Overall, both NF and RO membranes showed better results at different osmotic agent flow rates, but glucose proved to be the superior osmotic agent. For the binary systems, higher FO process efficacy across almost all parameters was noted for the systems with deionised water (DW). However, systems also used more energy; because such systems also used more energy they are not necessarily superior to other systems. Water recovery rate and water flux were considerably higher in a ternary system involving sucrose + NaCl + DW compared to the ternary system using brackish water as feed solution in FO process. Overall, FO efficiency for a ternary mixture of glucose osmotic agent + NaCl salt + BW was higher in water recovery and water flux than the other ternary mixtures with DW as feed solution. Based on the study results, a number of recommendations for future work are provided. Manipulated Osmosis Desalination (MOD) is a promising desalination approach that should be further investigated by analysing the factors affecting the process’ efficacy. Such factors are likely to include various membrane parameters (thickness, porosity and different pore diameters) and draw solutions as well as the process parameters including temperature, flow rates and osmotic agent concentrations. Further investigations should be conducted for binary and especially ternary systems involving different types of membranes and solutes for refining and optimising the process of selection. The Close loop circulation system needs to be replaced by the no-circulation systems for better FO performance in future studies. Importantly, the experimental results should be compared with the developed mathematical models to further validate the results. Finally, future MOD studies should focus on identifying optimal regeneration approaches. The selection of osmotic agents based on their regeneration economics along with other important FO parameters could be undertaken in future research...|$|E
3000|$|Coal-based {{electric}} power generation remains the basic source of obtaining energy. With increasing pressure to reduce CO 2 emissions, improving power unit efficiency has become an issue of utmost significance. Surely, one of the possibilities to improve the efficiency of new power units is raising the steam parameters. With improved power plant efficiency, there is a lower demand for power of almost all auxiliary equipment except the boiler feed pump. The {{reason for this is}} that the power needed to drive the feed pump is an almost linear function of the steam pressure. This means that, even though the steam mass flow (and, consequently, the <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> mass <b>flow)</b> is reduced and the efficiency of feed pumps is improved, their power increases. For this reason, it is very important to find the optimum drive of the boiler feed pump. The main aim of the conducted analysis was to compare various drive options of the boiler feed pump for a conceptual ultra-supercritical 900 -MW steam power unit. The following drive configurations of the boiler feed pump were presented and compared: [...]...|$|R

The water thin film falls on the inner tube and is subjected to a constant heat flux density, whereas the outer cylinder {{is assumed to be}} insulated and dry. An imposed air flow circulates within the gap between the two concentric tubes. The objective of this work is to understand the evaporation phenomenon in order to improve the average evaporated mass flux density and heat and mass transfer. Conservative equations governing the gas phase are solved numerically using the finite volume method. In the liquid phase, a method based on local heat and mass balances on each level is used. Thus, the following liquid film parameters, <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> mass <b>flow,</b> <b>feed</b> temperature and heat flux density, are taken into account. The obtained results are analyzed to emphasize and evaluate the influence of the previous operating parameters and the annulus curvature on the effective evaporation surface and on the mass flux density of evaporated water...|$|R
