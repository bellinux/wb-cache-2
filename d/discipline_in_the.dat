5|$|Under Justinian, {{there were}} eight {{teachers}} in the law schools of the Byzantine Empire, presumably four in each of Beirut and Constantinople's schools. Justinian mandated the supervision and enforcement of <b>discipline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> school of Beirut to the teachers, the city's bishop and the governor of Phoenicia Maritima.|$|E

In March 2007, Neuner won the pursuit and mass start races at Holmenkollen in Oslo, Norway, and she won the sprint and pursuit events at the season final in Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia, giving her seven career World Cup wins. She ended her first complete season fourth in the Overall World Cup standings and finished second in the pursuit <b>discipline.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> course of three months, Neuner had emerged from anonymity to become one of Germany's most popular female athletes. At the end of 2007, she had earned an estimated 1.3million euros through sponsorship and endorsement deals.|$|E
5|$|In early 1940, No. 605 (County of Warwick) Squadron {{moved to}} RAF Drem, as they {{converted}} to Hurricanes. McKellar {{was transferred to}} No. 605 and promoted to flight lieutenant, assuming the responsibilities of a flight leader on 21 June 1940. McKellar imposed strict discipline, both in standard of dress {{on the ground and}} in tactical <b>discipline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air. Despite his strict methods McKellar was held in high regard. His popularity arose from his desire to help mould his unit into a well-disciplined fighting team.|$|E

5|$|On November 19, the British {{flotilla}} was captured, but Carleton narrowly escaped {{and made}} his way to Quebec City. Montgomery's kind treatment toward the captured British prisoners caused several officers to express their concern. Montgomery saw this as a challenge to his authority and this, along with the lack of <b>discipline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> army, caused Montgomery to threaten resignation. Letters from Washington in which Washington also expressed his troubles with the discipline of troops convinced Montgomery to continue his command.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecological}} succession concept, pioneered in the 1900s and 1910s by Henry Chandler Cowles and Frederic Clements, {{was important in}} early plant ecology. Alfred Lotka's predator-prey equations, G. Evelyn Hutchinson's studies of the biogeography and biogeochemical structure of lakes and rivers (limnology) and Charles Elton's studies of animal food chains were pioneers among the succession of quantitative methods that colonized the developing ecological specialties. Ecology became an independent <b>discipline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1940s and 1950s after Eugene P. Odum synthesized many of the concepts of ecosystem ecology, placing relationships between groups of organisms (especially material and energy relationships) {{at the center of}} the field.|$|E
5|$|In 1530 Vermigli was {{appointed}} vicar {{of the monastery}} at San Giovanni in Monte, Bologna. There he learned Hebrew from a local Jewish doctor so he could read the Old Testament scriptures in their original language. Even among those who sought deeper biblical study, it was uncommon for clergy to learn Hebrew, though not unheard of. In 1533 the chapter-general elected Vermigli abbot of the two Lateran monasteries in Spoleto. At this post he was also responsible for two convents. The <b>discipline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> monastic houses in Vermigli's care had been lax before his arrival, and they had {{become a source of}} scandal in Spoleto. There was also a history of power struggle between the Bishop of Spoleto, Francesco Eroli, and the Spoletan abbacy, {{to the point that the}} bishop had excommunicated Vermigli's predecessor, only to be overturned by Rome. Vermigli brought order to his houses and mended the relationship with the bishop.|$|E

5|$|In 1903, Hutton, now General Officer Commanding Australian Military Forces, sent Chauvel to South Australia to organise {{the light}} horse regiments there. On {{returning}} to Queensland in 1904, he became acting Chief Staff Officer Queensland, based in Brisbane. He {{was promoted to}} the substantive rank of lieutenant colonel in December 1909, but his ambition to become the Australian representative on the Imperial General Staff in London was blocked by Hutton's successor Major General Charles Hoad. Based on his experiences in South Africa, Chauvel propounded ideas {{on the nature of}} mounted infantry. He recommended that Australian troops improve their <b>discipline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field, called for stronger leadership from officers, and emphasised the need for better organisation for supply and for timely and efficient medical evacuation.|$|E
5|$|In around 1270, Peckham {{returned}} to England, where he {{taught at the}} University of Oxford, and was elected the provincial minister of England (Minoriten) in 1275. After a brief stint in Rome, he was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury in 1279. His time as archbishop was marked by efforts to improve <b>discipline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> clergy as well as reorganize the estates of his see. Pluralism, or holding more than one clerical benefice, {{was one of the}} abuses that Peckham combatted. He served King Edward I of England in Wales, where he formed a low opinion of the Welsh people and laws. Before and during his time as archbishop, he wrote a number of works on optics, philosophy, and theology, as well as writing hymns. Numerous manuscripts of his works survive. On his death, his body was buried in Canterbury Cathedral, but his heart was given to the Franciscans for burial.|$|E
5|$|Mallory {{was placed}} on the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs. His {{assignment}} became significant when President Millard Fillmore in his Message to Congress of December 13, 1851, recommended Congressional action on two issues. First was the problem {{of what to do with}} ineffective officers in the Navy. At the time, promotion was based solely on seniority, and no policy existed for removing officers who could not or would not fulfill their duties. Second was the issue of <b>discipline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> enlisted rates. The practice of flogging had been outlawed in the previous Congress, and many of the old captains believed discipline on their warships was deteriorating; they wanted a return to the old ways, or at least a reasonable substitute that would enable them to exert their authority.|$|E

5|$|Prison {{films of}} the pre-Code era often {{involved}} {{men and women who}} were unjustly incarcerated, and films set in prisons of the north tended to portray them as a bastion of solidarity against the crumbling social system of the Great Depression. Sparked by the real-life Ohio penitentiary fire on April 21, 1930, in which guards refused to release prisoners from their cells, causing 300 deaths, the films depicted the inhumane conditions inside prisons in the early 1930s. The genre was composed of two archetypes: the prison film and the chain gang film. In the prison film, large hordes of men move about in identical uniforms, resigned to their fate, they live by a well defined code. In the chain gang film, Southern prisoners were subjected to a draconian system of <b>discipline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blazing outdoor heat, where they were treated terribly by their ruthless captors.|$|E
5|$|During Troglita's {{absence from}} Africa, the {{situation}} had been turbulent. Germanus had remained in the province until 539, and succeeded in restoring <b>discipline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> army and pacifying the core territories of Africa Proconsularis and Byzacena. He was succeeded by Solomon, who began his second tenure with great success, defeating the Moors of the Aurès Mountains and establishing control over Numidia and Mauretania Sitifensis. However, the Moorish revolt flared up again in 543 and Solomon {{was killed in the}} Battle of Cillium in 544. His successor, his nephew Sergius, was incompetent. He was defeated by the Moors, recalled and replaced with the senator Areobindus, who was murdered in spring 546 in another military revolt led by the general Guntharic. The latter intended to declare himself independent of Constantinople, but was soon murdered by the Armenian Artabanes. The need for a new and capable leader in Africa was apparent to Constantinople. After a truce was signed with Persia in 546, Emperor Justinian, perhaps, as Corippus implies, acting on Urbicius's advice, recalled Troglita from the East. After having him report on the situation there in Constantinople, the Emperor placed him {{at the head of a}} new army and sent him to Africa as the new magister militum per Africam in late summer 546.|$|E
5|$|Klein was {{appointed}} general of division in 1799 {{and crossed the}} Rhine at Kehl in Jean-Baptiste Jourdans Army of the Danube. He commanded the right flank of the Advance Guard, under command of François Joseph Lefebvre. His command included the 4th and 5th Hussar Regiments, the 17th Dragoons, the 1st Chasseurs à cheval, a light horse regiment, two companies of horse artillery, two of foot artillery, and a company of sappers. At the Battle of Ostrach, Klein's cavalry helped to secure the village of Hosskirch, a strategically important forward post, prior to the general engagement. After the French losses at Ostrach and the subsequent Battle of Stockach, Jourdan ordered a general withdrawal to the Black Forest. The reserve cavalry and most of Klein's division crossed the mountains and quartered near Offenburg, where their horses could find better forage. Despite the organized withdrawal and the relatively secure positions {{on the western side}} of the Black Forest, the army was in shambles. Jourdan placed his chief of staff Jean Augustin Ernouf in provisional command and went to Paris to complain about the state of his army, its equipment and its provisions. <b>Discipline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ranks disintegrated. Most of the divisional generals left their posts, except for Pierre Marie Barthélemy Ferino, Joseph Souham, Dominique Vandamme and Klein. In May, Andre Massena received overall command of both the Army of the Danube and the Army of Helvetia; Klein's column joined Massena near Zurich.|$|E

5|$|Robert's Sententiae, or Summa Theologica, {{was well}} known in his time, and has been {{considered}} a key connection in theology between Robert's own teachers' works and the works of Peter Lombard. Robert is the first commentator on St Paul to say that resistance to a tyrant might be vindicated by the Bible. Robert also opined that a king might be excommunicated if royal actions harmed the church. Robert used Gratian's works as sources for his own, citing the Decretum Gratiani. Although he used this work, which dealt with church law, he {{does not appear to}} have been considered a lawyer, and his training was that of a theologian. Furthermore, his years as a student predated the establishment of canon law as a distinct <b>discipline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> European schools. Robert's views of the glossators, and their main work Glossa Ordinaria was that they had shortened their glosses to such a point that they made them unintelligible. Robert was also known as a logician, and John of Salisbury named him one of the leading disputatores, or a person who used rhetoric and logic to debate in public.|$|E
