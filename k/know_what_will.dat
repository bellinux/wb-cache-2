A debriefing is typically done at the experiment's conclusion in order to reveal any deceptions used and generally make sure that the participants are unharmed by the procedures. Today, most research in social psychology involves no more risk of harm than can be expected from routine psychological testing or normal daily activities.|$|E

25|$|Imperatives {{are either}} {{hypothetical}} or categorical. Hypothetical imperatives provide the rules an agent must follow when she adopts a contingent end (an end based on desire or inclination). So, for example, if I want ice cream, I {{should go to}} the ice cream shop or make myself some ice cream. But notice that this imperative only applies if I want ice cream. If I have no interest in ice cream, the imperative does not apply to me. Kant thinks that {{there are two types of}} hypothetical imperative—rules of skill and counsels of prudence. Rules of skill are determined by the particular ends we set and tell us what is necessary to achieve those particular ends. However, Kant observes that there is one end that we all share, namely our own happiness. Unfortunately, it is difficult, if not impossible, to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>will</b> make us happy or how to achieve the things that will make us happy. Therefore, Kant argues, we can at best have counsels of prudence, as opposed to outright rules.|$|E

500|$|P.T.s ceaselessly looping hallway {{has been}} a source of {{critical}} discussion. Rob Crossley of GameSpot wrote that it induced [...] "mild claustrophobia" [...] and [...] "a familiarity with your surroundings". He remarked that while the length of the first part of the corridor worked to create tension, the design of the second part intentionally prevented the player from being able to keep everything in view, causing the player to feel vulnerable. David Houghton of GamesRadar described the looping corridor as [...] "the conduit for everything that it builds", along with saying that [...] "it fills that structure with an unbroken feedback loop of 'horror' ... every time you leave is a monumental relief, and every simultaneous instance of returning is a moment of primal foreboding at how things might, and almost certainly will, escalate, compounded by the knowledge of the seemingly countless iterations before." [...] Houghton felt that the game understood how to evoke horror by working [...] "within the realm of psychology". Polygon quoted a game player who said that [...] "P.T.s greatest asset is its looping hallway", elaborating that it not only invokes fear, but also [...] "curiosity, or a desire to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>will</b> happen next". Matulef said that the claustrophobic and repetitive environment displayed in the game can hypnotize the player into a sense of vulnerability.|$|E

500|$|In 1982 Sheldon Jaffery and Roy Torgeson {{met with}} Weinberg to propose taking over as licensees, but Weinberg {{decided not to}} pursue the offer. [...] The {{following}} year, Brian Forbes approached Weinberg with another offer. Forbes' company, the Bellerophon Network, was an imprint of a Los Angeles company named The Wizard. [...] Ashley reports that Weinberg was only able to contact Forbes by phone, and even that was not always reliable, so negotiations were slow. [...] Forbes' editorial director was Gordon Garb and the fiction editor was Gil Lamont; Forrest Ackerman also assisted, mainly by obtaining material to include. [...] There {{was a good deal}} of confusion between the various participants in the project: according to Locus, a science fiction trade journal, [...] "Ackerman says he has had no contact with publisher Forbes, does not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>will</b> happen to the material he put together, and is as much in the dark as everybody else. [...] Lamont says that he is still renegotiating his contract and is not sure where he stands". The original plan was for the first issue to appear in August 1984, dated July/August, but before it appeared the decision was taken to change the contents, and a new, completely reset issue finally appeared {{at the end of the}} year, dated Fall 1984. [...] Even with this delay a final agreement had not yet been reached with Weinberg over licensing. [...] Only 12,500 copies were printed; these were sent to two distributors who both went into bankruptcy. [...] As a result, few copies were sold, and Forbes was not paid by the distributors. [...] Despite the financial setback, Forbes attempted to continue, and a second issue eventually appeared. [...] Its cover date was Winter 1985 but it was not published until June 1986. [...] Few copies were printed; reports vary between 1,500 and 2,300 in total. [...] Mark Monsolo was the fiction editor, but Garb continued as editorial director; Lamont was no longer involved with the magazine.|$|E

She has a rather ditsy personality, and her large bust size is often used as a comical element in the story. She is close friends with Rika Minami, who works as a sniper on the prefectural police Special Assault Team, and she even house-sits for her. The group uses Rika's apartment to rest after they escape the high school. Although she is the oldest of the group at age 27, she is emotionally fragile and does not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>will</b> become of her life. She reveals to Takashi Komuro that she is just a temporary school nurse, and that she is still taking classes and training. Despite this, Marikawa has put her knowledge to good use, and even brings Kohta Hirano to his senses after he had mercy-killed Asami Nakaoka. As the only adult in the group, she drives the bus out of the school, and then Rika's military-grade Humvee.|$|E
