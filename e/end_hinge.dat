40|$|This Essay explores an {{entanglement}} of {{ends and}} means between two seem-ingly disparate {{parts of the}} Constitution: the Fourth Amendment and the separation of powers. Not only do these two elements of the Constitution share a common ambition; they are also intertwined in practical operation. The vindication of Fourth Amendment interests, however defined, depends on a measure of institutional differentiation between the branches of government. That predicate, however, has eroded over time. In its absence, difficult questions arise about how Fourth Amendment values are best implemented and whether their realization will in the <b>end</b> <b>hinge</b> on private rather than on state action...|$|E

50|$|Built in 1992, {{the bridge}} was the first {{cable-stayed}} road bridge in Greece. A technical challenge during the design and the construction phase was the extremely slender (L/480) longitudinally and transversally pre-stressed concrete deck with only 45 cm constant thickness, providing sufficient stiffness to abandon any longitudinal girder. The multi-strand stay-cables therefore have a closer spacing of app.5 m with a minimum inclination of 23 degrees and were directly used to support the free cantilever formworks during deck construction. For purpose of higher seismic performance, the concrete deck is monolithically connected with the towers. Constrained reaction due to temperature rise can be handled well due to the slender towers and the soft superstructure. At the transition piers at the bridge <b>ends</b> <b>hinged</b> tension pendulum members are used to transfer uplift forces into the substructure.|$|R

The main body tub was bolted to the chassis and the whole front <b>end</b> <b>hinged</b> forward to allow access to the engine. Every panel - including the sills and roof - could be unbolted from the car so that different body styles could be easily built on the same chassis. As an addition to the original coupé and saloon models, a convertible was introduced in 1960.|$|R

In {{order to}} explore micro-beam {{relaxation}} dynamics of MEMS, the beam deflection relaxation expression considering air slide-film damping effect was educed based on Euler–Bernoulli equation with boundary conditions of two <b>hinged</b> <b>ends.</b> The beam deflection relaxation process under over damping, critical damping and under damping was calculated used Maple.

40|$|Experiments and {{numerical}} simulations {{were conducted}} to investigate the dynamic response in a pipe-on-pipe impact event, in which a missile (swinging) pipe with one <b>end</b> <b>hinged</b> and the other end free impinges on an orthogonal simply-supported/clamped target pipe at its centre. This study focuses {{on the effects of}} the impact location on the missile pipe and the wall thickness of the pipes. The experiments were carried out by using a spring-powered catapult impact setup, the specimens used were made of seamless steel pipes of two different thicknesses, 1 mm and 3 mm respectively, and the target pipes were clamped. Seven tests were carried out using the catapult. Numerical simulations using the explicit finite element code LS-DYNA were performed on an HPC 360 workstation for each of the seven test cases. The results of the experiments and numerical simulations were compared, showing good agreement. Having confirmed the validity of the numerical model, numerical simulations were applied to the cases of a simply-supported target pipe, and the partitioning of the energy dissipation was calculated. As the response mode depends significantly on the initial impact position, the evolution of the response mode was examined numerically as the point of impact on the missile pipe was moved from the <b>hinged</b> <b>end</b> to the free end. it was found that there is a particular impact location for which the target pipe was most seriously damaged using the same impact speed.

Two banks of resonator tubes are laid into grooves in the frame so that they straddle the damper bar. The resonators are not firmly fastened to the frame. The ends of the shafts that gang the disks are attached to the drive of the motor via a drive belt similar to an O-ring.|$|R
50|$|The hinged design {{allows the}} trap to fold up flat into {{something}} only {{the width of}} one side panel. This makes it compact for storage and easy to transport to field locations (e.g. in a back pack). Both <b>ends</b> are <b>hinged,</b> but in normal operation the rear end is closed and the front folds inwards and latches the treadle, trigger plate, in place. When an animal enters far enough to be clear of the front door, their weight releases the latch and the door closes behind them.|$|R
40|$|When a flat elastic strip is {{compressed}} {{along its}} axis, it is bent {{in one of}} two possible directions via spontaneous symmetry breaking and forms a cylindrical arc, a phenomenon well known as Euler buckling. When this cylindrical section is pushed in the other direction, the bending direction can suddenly reverse. This instability is called snap-through buckling {{and is one of the}} elementary shape transitions in a prestressed thin structure. Combining experiments and theory, we study snap-buckling of an elastic strip with one <b>end</b> <b>hinged</b> and the other end clamped. These asymmetric boundary constraints break the intrinsic symmetry of the strip, generating rich exotic mechanical behaviors including largely hysteretic but reproducible force responses and switch-like discontinuous shape changes. We establish the set of exact analytical solutions that fully explain all of our major experimental and numerical findings. Asymmetric boundary conditions arise naturally in diverse situations when a thin object is in contact with a solid surface at one end, but their profound consequences for the buckling mechanics have been largely overlooked to date. The idea of introducing asymmetry through boundary conditions would yield new insight into complex and programmable functionalities in material and industrial design.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the dynamic {{non-linear}} behaviour of concentrically braced steel moment-resisting frames under severe earthquake conditions. The {{first part of the}} paper is devoted to the description of a non-linear beam element which has been developed starting from the classical one-component formulation, having concentrated inelastic <b>hinges</b> at the <b>ends.</b> The hysteretic behaviour of the <b>end</b> <b>hinges</b> is calibrated {{on the basis of a}} set of experimental tests previously performed at Politecnico di Milano. The non-linear brace element used to model the diagonal bars and the procedure for step-by-step dynamic analysis are then briefly summarized. In the second part of the paper two examples of application are presented; the first one concerns a six-storey MRF designed in accordance with Eurocode 8, in which concentric braces are introduced only to satisfy the serviceability limit state requirements (interstory drifts) but are not taken into account in the ultimate conditions. The numerically computed seismic behaviour of the system is analysed and compared to that of the unbraced frame. The second example is a six-storey CBF designed according to the Eurocode 8 specifications; the non-linear behaviour under seismic loading is studied especially to the aim of analysing the effect of the columns flexural stiffness and resistance, which was not considered in the design, on the CBF response...|$|R

40|$|A curved {{nonlinear}} {{finite element}} is developed {{in this work}} to observe the behavior of slender arches which undergo large deformations. The derivation of the strain equation {{is based upon the}} assumption that cross sections of the undeformed state remain undeformed and plane, but not necessarily normal to the centroidal axis during deformation. It is also assumed that the strain will be small and the rotations will be finite. The in-plane bending and the buckling modes for arches with fixed <b>end</b> and <b>hinged</b> <b>end</b> supports are analyzed. Deep circular arches and deep arches with arbitrary geometry of the centroidal axis are studied. Vertical concentrated loads, uniformly distributed loads, a combination of concentrated and distributed loads, and nonsymmetrical loads are considered. The governing differential equations are differentiated with respect to time to give a system of rate equations. Using these equations, the original nonlinear differential equations are solved using the Runge-Kutta scheme with Simpson's coefficients. If the solution drifts, a Newton-Raphson iteration scheme is used to return the solution to the equilibrium path...|$|R

40|$|We {{establish}} new existence {{results for}} multiple positive solutions of fourth-order nonlinear equations which model deflections of an elastic beam. We consider the widely studied boundary conditions corresponding to clamped and <b>hinged</b> <b>ends</b> and many non-local boundary conditions, with a unified approach. Our {{method is to}} show that each boundary-value problem can be written as the same type of perturbed integral equation, in the space C[0, 1], involving a linear functional α[u] but, although we seek positive solutions, the functional is not assumed to be positive for all positive u. The results are new even for the classic boundary conditions of clamped or <b>hinged</b> <b>ends</b> when α[u]= 0, because we obtain sharp results for the existence of one positive solution; for multiple solutions we seek optimal values of some of the constants that occur in the theory, which allows us to impose weaker assumptions on the nonlinear term than in previous works. Our non-local boundary conditions contain multi-point problems as special cases and, {{for the first time in}} fourth-order problems, we allow coefficients of both signs...|$|R

40|$|The natural {{frequencies}} and mode shapes of planar shear undeformable beams around their curved pre- stressed post-buckling configurations are investigated neglecting rotary inertia effects. Two mechanical models are considered {{depending on the}} assumed boundary conditions in the buckling and post-buckling phases. With the first model, the beam is considered inextensible because it is <b>hinged</b> at one <b>end</b> and is acted upon by an axial compressive force on the other <b>end,</b> a sliding <b>hinge.</b> In the second case, the beam is assumed inextensible in the pre-stressed phase (same boundary conditions as above), whereas it is extensible in the subsequent free linear dynamic phase because the sliding hinged boundary is changed into a stationary <b>hinged</b> <b>end.</b> Linear vibrations are governed by partial-differential equations with non-constant coefficients and the solutions for the frequencies and mode shapes are found employing two approximate approaches: a fully numerical method based on a finite element formulation and a semi-analytical method based on a weak formulation (Galerkin method). The main results are compared and a close agreement in the outcomes is found. The leading mechanical differences in the linear normal modes of the two pre- stressed curved beam models are discussed...|$|R
