40|$|Under the United States Constitution, a {{defendant}} {{has the right}} to a trial by jury composed of his or her peers. The intent is for the chosen jurors to be representative of the defendant‟s community. This study examined whether the <b>jury</b> <b>panels</b> in State Court in Hamilton County, Tennessee are representative of the community. A sample of 375 citizens who appeared for jury duty were given a questionnaire that measures the same demographic characteristics that appear in the United States 2010 Census. The results show that compared with the Census, the <b>jury</b> <b>panels</b> are not representative of the citizens who live in Hamilton County. Namely, the <b>jury</b> <b>panels</b> consist of a higher percentage of Whites, males, and citizens with higher levels of education and income. Similar results were found in a sample collected nearly a decade ago when compared with the U. S. Census. The findings from the present study indicate that <b>jury</b> <b>panels</b> may not be demographically representative, and therefore, not composed of a fair cross section of the community. This is the first known study to examine the representativeness of juries. The legal implications and suggestions for future research will be discussed...|$|R

2500|$|Since {{there is}} always the {{possibility}} of jurors not completing a trial for health or other reasons, often one or more alternate jurors are selected.

[...] In Connecticut, alternate jurors are dismissed before the panel of sworn jurors begin deliberation. [...] Connecticut General Statutes 51-243(e) and 54-82h do not allow alternate jurors to be segregated from the regular sworn jurors. In civil cases in Connecticut, C.G.S. 51-243(e) provides that alternate jurors [...] "shall be dismissed."

2500|$|Court {{hearings}} {{began in}} spring 2006. The accused {{maintained that the}} assassination was staged by Chubais himself.

He agreed to slander defendants after his kidnappers threatened to imprison his wife and showed him a forged protocol of the search in his apartment illegal ammunition and narcotics had been found. He provided audio recordings of some of his conversations with militia officers pressuring him, but the judge refused to make an examination of this tape and to file it to the case. Right away after that Karvatko's statement the <b>jury</b> <b>panel</b> was dismissed {{at the request of the}} prosecutor who stated the jury could no longer remain unbiased when they heard how Karvatko's testimony had been obtained. Only the initial of Karvatko's testimonies had been considered valid by court. While the lawyers of the plaintiff insisted that Karvatko was pressured by the suspects and their friends, Tatiana Mironova, mother of another suspect, Ivan Mironov, publicly accused investigators in torturing Karvatko. In December 2006 the court was restarted with the a new jury. As of December 2007, jury had been dismissed again, and hearings continued with the third jury. Pro-Kremlin liberal media pleaded for [...] "tough sentences," [...] to cool [...] "folk avengers" [...] and finally, after three years of imprisonment Kvachkov, Naydenov and Yashin were acquitted by the court on 5 June 2008. After the acquittal of Kvachkov, Chubais made statement saying that he has no doubts that Kvachkov was responsible for the assassination, and that it was Kvachkov who personally tried to shoot him in March 2005. On the other hand, he believes that acquittal of the guilty is better than sentencing of innocent Kvachkov, in retaliation, called the attack on Chubais the [...] "first act of armed resistance in the national liberation war", Around the same time, Kvachkov said [...] "now I have a chance to finish what I started", meaning his doctoral thesis, but some media quoted it out of context. Still he maintained that he did not participate in the assassination and that it was staged by Chubais himself to divert attention from his business problems The case returned to court again after the prosecution's appeal. The new trial started on 29 September 2008. The next court session was postponed until 13 October because only 6 out of 500 potential jurors arrived to court on the day the jury selection was scheduled to begin. On 13 October 2008 the case was sent by court back to the prosecution after the judge received Kvachkov's case and Ivan Mironov's case as two separate cases. The judge sent both cases back to the prosecutor so that they could be merged into one case. The trial on a new merged case began on 23 November 2009.
