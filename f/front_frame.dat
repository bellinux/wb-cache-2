25|$|Constructed on site, {{the main}} {{parabolic}} frames of St Paul's Church were of laminated timber, {{with the exception}} of the <b>front</b> <b>frame</b> which was made of pre-cast concrete. The first two laminated arches constructed were used as the basis for the formwork of the front concrete arch. The unusual form of the nave with its exposed internal structure led to it being compared to World War II igloos. With their large curved trusses made from small pieces of timber, igloos were a familiar building type to Oribin who had worked in the Allison Overhaul Assembly Plant igloos at Albion during World War II.|$|E
500|$|The {{equations}} {{show that}} the bicycle is like an inverted pendulum with the lateral position of its support controlled by terms representing roll acceleration, roll velocity and roll displacement to steering torque feedback. The roll acceleration term is normally of the wrong sign for self-stabilization and {{can be expected to}} be important mainly in respect of wobble oscillations. The roll velocity feedback is of the correct sign, is gyroscopic in nature, being proportional to speed, and is dominated by the front wheel contribution. The roll displacement term is the most important one and is mainly controlled by trail, steering rake and the offset of the <b>front</b> <b>frame</b> mass center from the steering axis. All the terms involve complex combinations of bicycle design parameters and sometimes the speed. The limitations of the benchmark bicycle are considered and extensions to the treatments of tires, frames and riders ...|$|E
