25|$|From the MAX system's opening until 2012, riding {{was free}} in Fareless Square (known as the <b>Free</b> <b>Rail</b> Zone from 2010 to 2012), which {{included}} all of downtown and, starting in 2001, {{part of the}} Lloyd District. The 37-year-old fare-free zone was discontinued on September 1, 2012, as part of systemwide cost-cutting measures. As {{part of the same}} budget cuts, TriMet discontinued its zonal fares, moving to a flat fare system. Zones had been in place since 1986, with higher fares for longer rides, and three fare zones (five until 1988).|$|E

Originally the city's internal bus network was run by Ulsterbus, which still provides the city's connections with other towns in Northern Ireland. The city's buses are now run by Ulsterbus Foyle, just as Translink Metro now provides the bus service in Belfast. The Ulsterbus Foyle network offers 13 routes across the city into the suburban areas, excluding an Easibus link which connects to the Waterside and Drumahoe, and a <b>free</b> <b>Rail</b> Link Bus runs from the Waterside Railway Station to the city centre.

25|$|During the Victorian era Canvey {{became a}} very fashionable place to visit, and its air was {{promoted}} as having healing properties. This started in 1899, after the Black Monday floods, when an entrepreneur called Frederick Hester bought Leigh Beck Farm, and started {{what was to}} be called Southview Park estate. The properties sold very quickly so Frederick bought more plots of land, selling them as dream homes for London's Eastenders. Hester wanted to create Canvey as a great seaside resort for Londoners, and so built the first promenade, a pier and a magnificent winter garden & palace, of which he planned to cover six miles (but only covered a mile), as well as a mono rail system (initially horse drawn then later electric). Hester marketed Canvey as Ye Old Dutch Island giving many of the new roads Dutch sounding names, and enticing potential buyers with <b>free</b> <b>rail</b> tickets. The project started well with thousands of plots sold, however by 1905 the scheme had fallen apart due to materials not being delivered and issues with land ownership with the laying of the mono rail. Hester was declared bankrupt and everything was sold off at an auction held at Chimney's Farm.|$|E
2500|$|Ridership {{continued}} {{to expand rapidly}} on the Green Line. In the first workweek of the year, more than 8,000 riders a day boarded at the three stations (more than 5,000 of them at Anacostia), exceeding Metro's estimates. Although nearly 10,000 riders were boarding each day at the three stations by {{the third week of}} January, Metro nonetheless handed out <b>free</b> <b>rail</b> passes (the first <b>free</b> <b>rail</b> pass giveaway in the transit agency's history) to customers at the three stations to encourage ridership. By March 1992, the number of weekday riders had risen to nearly 11,000 per day at Anacostia station alone.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{arrival in}} the UK, the {{released}} AIF prisoners of war were either sent to a hospital if they required medical attention or proceeded directly to the AIF Transit Camp at Eastbourne. Hospitalised soldiers were also posted to Eastbourne upon release. Upon arrival at Eastbourne, the soldiers were provided with a meal, accommodation, a uniform and an advance on their pay, {{as well as a}} [...] "welcome" [...] package from the Red Cross. They were also allowed to send a cable to Australia free of charge. The soldiers also received medical checks and more than double the usual rations. Shortly after arriving at Eastbourne the former POWs were granted 14 days leave and given <b>free</b> <b>rail</b> passes. At the conclusion of this leave they were allocated to a reception camp, generally with soldiers from their own state. The men in these camps were provided with entertainment, and many also undertook education.|$|E

2500|$|Out of Europe's {{five major}} {{football}} leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Ligue 1, and Serie A [...] ), the Bundesliga {{has the lowest}} ticket prices and the highest average attendance. Many club stadia have large terraced areas for standing fans (by comparison, stadia in the English Premier League are all-seaters due to the Taylor Report). Teams {{limit the number of}} season tickets to ensure everyone has a chance to see the games live, and the away club has the right to 10% of the available capacity. Match tickets often double as <b>free</b> <b>rail</b> passes which encourages supporters to travel and celebrate in a relaxed atmosphere. According to Bundesliga chief executive Christian Seifert, tickets are inexpensive (especially for standing room) as [...] "It is not in the clubs' culture so much [...] They are very fan orientated". Uli Hoeneß, former president of Bayern Munich, was quoted as saying [...] "We do not think the fans are like cows to be milked. Football has got to be for everybody." ...|$|E
2500|$|Effective in 2011, {{the service}} was heavily reduced, {{as a result of}} {{budgetary}} constraints caused by the recession's impact on TriMet's finances, from about 30–35 dates per year in recent years to just seven dates. [...] Although the 2011 schedule included Vintage Trolley service on every Sunday during the peak holiday shopping season, in the last weeks of the year, otherwise the only scheduled operating dates of the entire year were the three Sundays nearest to Memorial Day, Independence Day and Labor Day specifically May 29, July 3 and September 4, 2011. [...] The route, frequency and hours of operation (on days of operation) remained unchanged. [...] The schedule of operating dates followed the same pattern in subsequent years, and the scheduled dates of operation in 2013 were May 26, July 7, September 1, and four consecutive Sundays from December 1 through December 22. [...] Even after TriMet discontinued Fareless Square (latterly known as the <b>Free</b> <b>Rail</b> Zone), in downtown, rides on Vintage Trolley remained free, but donations were welcomed.|$|E
2500|$|Passengers {{not already}} in {{possession}} of a valid fare when boarding are required to purchase tickets from ticket vending machines on board each streetcar. Each vehicle also carries a ticket validator machine, for stamping [...] "unvalidated" [...] TriMet tickets purchased in advance. TriMet and Portland Streetcar have agreed to honor one another's fares, which means that TriMet passes, tickets and bus transfer receipts are accepted on the streetcar, and tickets purchased or validated on a streetcar are valid for travel on TriMet services (bus, MAX or WES Commuter Rail). To facilitate this, the ticket machines on board the streetcars and at streetcar stops sell TriMet tickets – covering both the streetcar fare and any TriMet rides the purchaser makes within the ticket's period of validity (2 hours or all day) – as well as streetcar-only tickets. For the same reason, prior to September 2012, the streetcar ticket machines offered all-zone (three-zone) and two-zone tickets, {{despite the fact that the}} streetcar system was located entirely within TriMet's Zone 1. TriMet tickets and transfers were valid all-day on the streetcar prior to that change, which also coincided with TriMet's elimination of the <b>Free</b> <b>Rail</b> Zone (Fareless Square). Since September 1, 2012, TriMet and Portland Streetcar tickets have an identical period of validity, of two hours (except for all-day tickets).|$|E

50|$|Fareless Square was an area within central Portland, Oregon, {{where all}} rides on TriMet buses and light rail and the Portland Streetcar were free.

It existed from January 1975 through August 2012, but was briefly renamed the <b>Free</b> <b>Rail</b> Zone in January 2010 after its coverage became limited to light rail and streetcar service, with bus rides no longer being free. The TriMet board decided in June 2012 to discontinue the <b>Free</b> <b>Rail</b> Zone primarily to help fill a large shortfall in the agency's budget, and the action was one component of a package of extensive budget cuts which also included service reductions and fare increases.
