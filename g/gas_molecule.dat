25|$|Thermoacoustic {{devices are}} very {{different}} from Stirling devices, although the individual path travelled by each working <b>gas</b> <b>molecule</b> does follow a real Stirling cycle. These devices include the thermoacoustic engine and thermoacoustic refrigerator. High-amplitude acoustic standing waves cause compression and expansion analogous to a Stirling power piston, while out-of-phase acoustic travelling waves cause displacement along a temperature gradient, analogous to a Stirling displacer piston. Thus a thermoacoustic device typically does not have a displacer, as found in a beta or gamma Stirling.|$|E
25|$|Solubility of {{permanent}} gases usually decreases with increasing temperature at around room temperature. However, for aqueous solutions, the Henry's law solubility constant for many species {{goes through a}} minimum. For most permanent gases, the minimum is below 120°C. Often, the smaller the <b>gas</b> <b>molecule</b> (and the lower the gas solubility in water), the lower {{the temperature of the}} maximum of the Henry's law constant. Thus, the maximum is at about 30°C for helium, 92 to 93°C for argon, nitrogen and oxygen, and 114°C for xenon.|$|E
25|$|This {{equation}} is correct {{to a much}} wider temperature range, but still depends on the approximation of heat capacity ratio being independent of temperature, {{and for this reason}} will fail, particularly at higher temperatures. It gives good predictions in relatively dry, cold, low pressure conditions, such as the Earth's stratosphere. The equation fails at extremely low pressures and short wavelengths, due to dependence {{on the assumption that the}} wavelength of the sound in the gas is much longer than the average mean free path between <b>gas</b> <b>molecule</b> collisions. A derivation of these equations will be given in the following section.|$|E

If the pore diameter is smaller than the mean free path of the diffusing <b>gas</b> <b>molecules</b> and {{the density of the}} gas is low, the <b>gas</b> <b>molecules</b> collide with the pore walls more frequently than with each other.

25|$|Since {{it is at}} {{the limit}} of (or beyond) current {{technology}} to observe individual gas particles (atoms or molecules), only theoretical calculations give suggestions about how they move, but their motion is different from Brownian motion because Brownian motion involves a smooth drag due to the frictional force of many gas molecules, punctuated by violent collisions of an individual (or several) gas molecule(s) with the particle. The particle (generally consisting of millions or billions of atoms) thus moves in a jagged course, yet not so jagged as would be expected if an individual <b>gas</b> <b>molecule</b> were examined.|$|E
25|$|Le Sage's own theory {{became a}} subject of re-newed {{interest}} {{in the latter part}} of the 19th century following a paper published by Kelvin in 1873. Unlike Leray, who treated the heat problem imprecisely, Kelvin stated that the absorbed energy represents a very high heat, sufficient to vaporize any object in a fraction of a second. So Kelvin re-iterated an idea that Fatio had originally proposed in the 1690s for attempting to deal with the thermodynamic problem inherent in Le Sage's theory. He proposed that the excess heat might be absorbed by internal energy modes of the particles themselves, based on his proposal of the vortex-nature of matter. In other words, the original translational kinetic energy of the particles is transferred to internal energy modes, chiefly vibrational or rotational, of the particles. Appealing to Clausius's proposition that the energy in any particular mode of a <b>gas</b> <b>molecule</b> tends toward a fixed ratio of the total energy, Kelvin went on to suggest that the energized but slower moving particles would subsequently be restored to their original condition due to collisions (on the cosmological scale) with other particles. Kelvin also asserted that it would be possible to extract limitless amounts of free energy from the ultramundane flux, and described a perpetual motion machine to accomplish this.|$|E

The scattering of <b>gas</b> <b>molecules</b> on quartz surfaces covered with VA-SWNTs is investigated by the molecular beam technique. The energy accommodation coefficients of helium, which tend to be small even for rough surfaces because of the large mass mismatch between helium and surface atoms, are close to unity on the modified surfaces.
