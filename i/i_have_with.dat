In a 2006 interview, Gillan said of Blackmore's final 1993 departure from Deep Purple, [...] "he {{turned into a}} really weird guy, and the day {{he walked out of}} the tour was the day the clouds disappeared and the day the sunshine came out and we haven't looked back since." [...] He added that [...] "there are certain personal issues that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> Ritchie, which means that I will never speak to him again. Nothing I'm going to discuss publicly, but deeply personal stuff." ...|$|E
500|$|London's {{initially}} cool {{reception of}} Messiah led Handel {{to reduce the}} season's planned six performances to three, and not to present the work at all in 1744—to the considerable annoyance of Jennens, whose relations with the composer temporarily soured. [...] At Jennens's request, Handel made several changes in the music for the 1745 revival: [...] "Their sound is gone out" [...] became a choral piece, the soprano song [...] "Rejoice greatly" [...] was recomposed in shortened form, and the transpositions for Cibber's voice were restored to their original soprano range. Jennens wrote to Holdsworth on 30 August 1745: [...] " [...] has made a fine Entertainment of it, though not near so good as he might & ought to have done. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> great difficulty made him correct some of the grosser faults in the composition..." [...] Handel directed two performances at Covent Garden in 1745, on 9 and 11 April, and then set the work aside for four years.|$|E
500|$|On 25 July 2014, Chelsea {{announced}} on their official website that Drogba completed {{his return to}} the club on a free transfer, and signed a one-year contract. Speaking on his move back to the club, Drogba said: [...] "It was an easy decision. I couldn't turn down the opportunity to work with José Mourinho again. Everyone knows the special relationship <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> this club and it has always felt like home to me." [...] Mourinho also commented on the transfer, saying: [...] "He's coming because he's one of the best strikers in Europe. I know his personality very well and I know if he comes back he's not protected by history or what he's done for this club previously. He is coming with the mentality to make more history." [...] On 28 July 2014, Chelsea announced that Drogba would wear the number 15 shirt which he wore when he first signed for the club in 2004. Mohamed Salah, who wore the number during the 2013–14 season, took over the number 17 shirt vacated by Eden Hazard. On 15 August, however, it was announced that Drogba had been given back the number 11 shirt he previously wore at the club, with its previous occupant Oscar taking over the number 8 jersey vacated by Frank Lampard.|$|E

500|$|Several {{elements}} of the episode were highlighted for their implausibility. The arrival of New Directions in New York without having their songs already prepared received widespread condemnation, including from VanDerWerff and the Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson, and led Brown to write, [...] "there is absolutely no universe in which that makes sense. At all. It was so logically unsound that it was distracting." [...] The notion that Rachel would not know that Cats had closed eleven years before was derided by Brown and Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times, while Rachel and Kurt's encounter with [...] "the only friendly security guard in New York City" [...] was mocked by Anthony Benigno of The Faster Times and Entertainment Weekly Sandra Gonzalez. Several critics were disappointed that Quinn's ominous mention of plans for New York in [...] "Funeral" [...] came to nothing, including Benigno, who called her actual idea a [...] "cockamamie sabotage plot", though he credited Agron's scene as a [...] "great, wasted job in a great, wasted character", sentiments echoed by VanDerWerff and James Poniewozik of Time. Terron R. Moore of Ology.com gave the episode a [...] "C+", and likened Quinn's dropped plot to Will leaving for Broadway and Rachel disowning her love for Finn: [...] "the fact {{that none of this}} happened—and the fact that we know none of it would ever happen—is just another issue <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> the show. I hope that next season, it actually grows a pair." ...|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast, [...] "Homer's Night Out" [...] finished fourteenth {{place in the}} weekly ratings for the week of March 19–25, 1990, with a Nielsen rating of 16.9. It was the second highest rated show on the Fox network that week. [...] "Homer's Night Out" [...] received generally positive reviews from critics. In a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck gave the episode a rating of 4/5 and named it one of his two favorite episodes of the season. He added that it [...] "allows us to see that Homer really does love Marge a lot without having to blatantly stamp sentimentality all over it. The episode is strange, goofy and fun." [...] Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said that [...] "the concept of Marge’s anger at Homer got old, but this episode managed to offer a reasonably entertaining affair. It was fun to see Homer treated like a party god, and this offered a few nice moments. The overall level of quality remained good throughout the show, but it didn’t rise to any great heights." [...] David Packard at DVD Verdict said {{in a review of}} The Simpsons [...] "Gone Wild" [...] DVD that [...] "this episode sports some of the awkward animation and voice work that is prevalent in episodes from the first season. That aspect isn't an issue to me; in fact, I quite enjoy season one as it shows the early efforts of the series getting its legs in making the transition from its origin on The Tracey Ullman Show. The problem <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> this episode is that it's not particularly funny. I chuckled a few times, but the episode doesn't have the rollicking gags and sly humor of the two episodes to follow." ...|$|E

The multiple ending factor also helps." [...] Quandary's Rosemary Young scored it 3.5 out of 5, pointing out [...] "though some aspects of Blade Runner aren't all that sophisticated, it is worth considering for fans of 'hard-edged' crime/science fiction." [...] In a 2006 review for Adventure Gamers, Chris Pickering scored the game 4.5 out of 5, praising it for its [...] "glorious aesthetics, intriguing storyline, and well implemented controls." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, {{one reason}} Florida never {{became a part}} of Georgia might be found in the vagaries of the wind. [...] May 13, 1777 was the date picked for Elbert and Baker to combine their forces and drive back the British. [...] Many {{problems}} prevented Elbert’s sea expedition from reaching its destination on time. [...] While on the boats, the men were stricken by disease, which combined with supply problems and head winds, slowed their progress considerably. [...] In addition, the waters in this area are relatively low in the spring, making navigation somewhat difficult. [...] On May 30, Elbert {{wrote in a letter to}} his brother in law, Colonel Joseph Habersham, [...] "could we have got the Galleys into St. John’s river, I would, with the men <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> me, made the whole province of East Florida tumble." ...|$|E
2500|$|IGN's Chris Roper {{scored the}} PlayStation 3 version 7.5 out of 10, calling it [...] "certainly the best {{version of the}} bunch." [...] Of the controls, he wrote [...] "it doesn't feel as {{rewarding}} or [...] "realistic" [...] as EA would have liked. Really, it just feels like you're suggesting what should happen and then hoping it does." [...] He was also critical of the graphics; [...] "its visuals are simply poor for a next-generation title. Other than the high-definition output, it doesn't look like anything has been noticeably changed. Texture resolution is pretty bad, some of the effects are very last-gen {{and it really does}} look like you're playing a PS2 game in HD." [...] He concluded [...] "the game is a strong and rather noticeable improvement over the original release, though much of it does feel outdated on the PlayStation 3. EA has done a great job of expanding nearly every facet of the game, [...] with last-gen visuals, a frustrating city layout and other issues that plagued the original release, it's still far from perfect." [...] Game Informers Matt Helgeson also scored it 7.5 out of 10, writing [...] "it still doesn't solve the problems <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> the game as a whole, which remain largely the same." [...] He concluded [...] "The Godfathers uninspired craftsmanship falls short of being a truly compelling game experience." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{reducing}} Buemi's lead by 22 {{points in}} the preceding New York City ePrix, di Grassi stated that his team had to improve vastly in gaining any hope of winning the championship in Montreal and was feeling more confident that he previously been: [...] "With the experience that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> Formula E, {{you know that it}} can go from hell to heaven any weekend, any race. We just have to do our best, try and win both races and see how it goes." [...] Buemi, the pre-title favourite, missed the New York City races because of a World Endurance Championship commitment at the Nürburgring, but stated he would prepare for the Montreal events the same way as he would with any other ePrix: [...] "We will try to do the best possible. I hope we can finish this season in style and look forward to it." [...] He created controversy when he raised the issue of his crash with di Grassi at the 2016 London ePrix, saying: [...] "If [...] happens once more like this, what do you think people will think then? It will be very hard to explain for him. He can’t afford anything like that again for his reputation, can he?" [...] Di Grassi responded by noting Buemi lost the first season championship through a driver error and said Buemi had more pressure and another mistake would prevent him from reclaiming the championship: [...] "Everyone feels pressure in a different way of course. He has pressure big time this weekend, much more than me, this is because everyone will be waiting to see if those mistakes come again in Montreal." ...|$|E
