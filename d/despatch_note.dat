50|$|A {{bulletin}} d'expédition, sometimes {{known as}} a parcel card, is a parcel <b>despatch</b> <b>note.</b> Bulletin d'expédition {{have been widely used}} across the world. They may travel with the parcel and be delivered at the same time, or they may indicate to the recipient that a parcel is ready to be collected from their local post office. The cards were introduced after the establishment of the international parcel service by the Universal Postal Union on 1 October 1881 (Great Britain, India, The Netherlands and Persia, 1 April 1882), following the Paris agreement of 1880.|$|E

6000|$|These points {{then being}} {{arranged}} {{to the poor}} fellow's satisfaction, {{what does he do}} but send out for half a quire of pink note-paper, and in a filagree envelope <b>despatch</b> a <b>note</b> of invitation to the ladies at the [...] "Bootjack":-- ...|$|R
6000|$|He <b>despatched</b> the <b>note</b> on Easter Eve, {{and there}} seemed a {{finality}} in their decisions. But other forces and laws than theirs were in operation. On Easter Monday morning {{he received a}} message from the Widow Edlin, whom he had directed to telegraph if anything serious happened: ...|$|R
6000|$|Having <b>despatched</b> this <b>note</b> {{by special}} messenger, she serenely {{set to work}} on less {{important}} matters, and met him in modish street dress--trim and neat and very far from the meretricious glitter of The Baroness. He was glad of this; he would have disliked her in négligée, no matter how [...] "artistic." ...|$|R
60|$|The Empress at once <b>despatched</b> a <b>note</b> {{requesting}} Don Carlos {{to present}} himself without {{delay in the}} private drawing-room of the Palace. The happy lover and ambassador flew to her side, and {{for half an hour}} the pair enjoyed the delicious Paradise of a mutual attachment. At the end of that period Don Pedro presented himself at the door.|$|R
60|$|Imogene <b>despatched</b> a <b>note,</b> which Colville got {{the next}} morning, {{to tell him}} of his crime, and apprise him of his punishment, and of the sweet compunction that had pleaded {{for him in the}} breast of the child. If he did not think he could help play the comedy through, he must come {{prepared}} to offer Effie some sort of atonement.|$|R
5000|$|Captain Rowe, Company A, 2nd Cavalry, California Volunteers, <b>despatched</b> a <b>note</b> to Colonel Evans at Camp Independence {{stating that}} he and Mr. Wasson, the Indian Agent, had talked to Indian leaders {{in the area and}} made a treaty with them. A {{temporary}} peace was made for the summer with the Owens Valley Indian leaders, in anticipation of a permanent arrangement to follow. - On July 7, 1862.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If I {{had thought}} of it, Amy,' said Mr Dorrit, with a {{patronage}} as magnificent as that of Lord Decimus himself, 'you should have <b>despatched</b> a <b>note</b> to them, asking them to dine to-day. Some of our people could have--ha--fetched them, and taken them home. We could have spared a--hum--gondola for that purpose. I am sorry to have forgotten this. Pray remind me of them to-morrow.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was reading}} a story--one of the Nosegay Novelettes; I {{do not know if}} you are {{familiar}} with the series, sir?--in which much the same situation occurred. It was entitled 'Cupid or Mammon!' The heroine, Lady Blanche Trefusis, forced by her parents to wed a wealthy suitor, <b>despatches</b> a <b>note</b> to her humble lover, informing him it cannot be. I believe it often happens like that, sir." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well!" [...] cried Lapham, helplessly submitting. He {{took out}} his watch, and {{saw that he had}} forty minutes to catch the four o'clock train. He hurried back to his office, and put {{together}} some papers preparatory to going, and <b>despatched</b> a <b>note</b> by his boy to Mrs. Lapham saying that he was starting for New York, and did not know just when he should get back.|$|R
6000|$|... [3] [Scott is here far too harsh. [...] "Euphues" [...] {{is not a}} book to be <b>despatched</b> in a <b>note,</b> but {{the reader}} may be {{requested}} to suspend his judgment until he has read it.--ED.] ...|$|R
6000|$|He enjoined Doctor and Mrs. Portman to {{say nothing}} about the {{business}} at Fairoaks; whither he contented himself with <b>despatching</b> the <b>note</b> we have before mentioned. And then {{he returned to his}} hotel, where he vented his wrath upon Mr. Morgan his valet, [...] "dammin and cussin upstairs and downstairs," [...] as that gentleman observed to Mr. Foker's man, in whose company he partook of dinner in the servants' room of the George.|$|R
60|$|At {{hearing the}} very merciful {{nature of the}} punishment, Picotee sighed without replying; and Ethelberta <b>despatched</b> her <b>note.</b> The hour of {{appointment}} drew near, and Ethelberta showed symptoms of unrest. Six o'clock struck and passed. She walked here and there for nothing, and it was plain that a dread was filling her: her letter might accidentally have had, {{in addition to the}} moral effect which she had intended, the practical effect which she did not intend, by arriving before, instead of after, his purposed visit to her, thereby stopping him in spite of all her care.|$|R
60|$|When he had <b>despatched</b> the <b>note</b> by a boy {{he regretted}} {{that in his}} hurry he should have {{suggested}} to her to meet him out of doors, when he might have said he would call upon her. It was, in fact, the country custom to meet thus, and nothing else had occurred to him. Arabella had been met in the same way, unfortunately, and it might not seem respectable to a dear girl like Sue. However, {{it could not be}} helped now, and he moved towards the point a few minutes before the hour, under the glimmer of the newly lighted lamps.|$|R
6000|$|He {{travelled}} {{night and}} day, until {{he arrived in}} the vicinity of Mr. Cleveland's abode. What was he to do now? After some deliberation, he <b>despatched</b> a <b>note</b> to Mr. Cleveland, informing him [...] "that he (Mr. Grey) was the bearer to Mr. Cleveland of a 'communication of importance.' Under the circumstances of the case, he observed that he had declined bringing any letters of introduction. He was quite aware, therefore, that he should have no right to complain if he had to travel back three hundred miles without having the honour of an interview; but he trusted that this necessary breach of etiquette would be overlooked." ...|$|R
60|$|He nodded. “That will do.” And sitting still, {{with his}} hat pushed off his forehead, {{he thought that}} it was just like Heat’s confounded cheek to carry off quietly the only piece of {{material}} evidence. But he thought this without animosity. Old and valued servants will take liberties. The piece of overcoat with the address sewn on was certainly not a thing to leave about. Dismissing from his mind this manifestation of Chief Inspector Heat’s mistrust, he wrote and <b>despatched</b> a <b>note</b> to his wife, charging her to make his apologies to Michaelis’ great lady, with whom they were engaged to dine that evening.|$|R
60|$|That evening Mr Sudberry, {{having spent}} the day in a {{somewhat}} excited state--having swept everything around him, wherever he moved, with his coat-tails, as with the besom of destruction--having <b>despatched</b> a <b>note</b> to the nearest constabulary station, and having examined the bolts and fastenings of {{the windows of the}} White House--sat down after supper to read the newspaper, and fell fast asleep, with his head hanging over the back of his chair, his nose turned up to the ceiling, and his mouth wide open. His loving family--minus Tilly and Jacky, who were abed-- encircled the table, variously employed; and George stood at his elbow, fastening up a pair of bookshelves of primitive construction, coupled together by means of green cord.|$|R
6000|$|I {{have been}} going to write {{to you for a}} long time, but have always had in my mind that you might come here with Lotty any day. As Lotty has come without you, however (witness a {{tremendous}} rampaging and ravaging now going on upstairs!), I <b>despatch</b> this <b>note</b> to say that I suppose you have seen the announcement of [...] "the" [...] new weekly thing, and that if you would ever write anything for it, you would please me better than I can tell you. We hope to do some solid good, and we mean to be as cheery and pleasant as we can. (And, putting our hands in our breeches pockets, we say complacently, that our money is as good as Blackwood's any day in the week.) ...|$|R
6000|$|Lucilla {{hurried back}} to fulfil the mission of Nemesis to the Charterises, which she called justice to Edna, and by the nine o'clock post <b>despatched</b> three <b>notes.</b> One {{containing}} the notice for the Times--'On the 17th instant, at 8, Little Whittington-street, St. Wulstan's, Edna, the beloved wife of Owen Charteris Sandbrook, Esq.;' another was to order a complete array of mourning from her dressmaker; and the third was to the Reverend Peter Prendergast, in the most simple manner requesting him to arrange for the burial of her sister-in-law, at 5 P.M. on the ensuing Saturday, indicating the labourers who should act as bearers, and ending with, 'You will be relieved by hearing that she was no other than our dear Edna, married on the 14th of July, last year.' ...|$|R
60|$|THE fête at 'the Pavilion,' {{such was}} {{the title of the}} Twickenham Villa, though the subject of {{universal}} interest, was anticipated by no one with more eager anxiety than by Sir Lucius Grafton; for that day, he determined, should decide the fate of the Duke of St. James. He was sanguine as to the result, nor without reason. For the last month he had, by his dark machinery, played desperately upon the feelings of Lady Aphrodite; and more than once had she <b>despatched</b> rapid <b>notes</b> to her admirer for counsel and for consolation. The Duke was more skilful in soothing her griefs than in devising expedients for their removal. He treated the threatened as a distant evil! and wiped away her tears in a manner which is almost an encouragement to weep.|$|R
60|$|As he was {{returning}} to Ennis Neville was so far removed from immediate distress as {{to be able to}} look forward without fear to his meeting with the two ladies at Ardkill. He could as yet take his Kate in his arms without any hard load upon his heart, such as would be there if he knew that it was incumbent upon him at once to explain his difficulties. His uncle was still living, but was old and still ill. He would naturally make the most of the old man's age and infirmities. There was every reason why they should wait, and no reason why such waiting should bring reproaches upon his head. On the night of his arrival at his quarters he <b>despatched</b> a <b>note</b> to his Kate.|$|R
60|$|When {{the demise}} took place, {{her husband was}} in London {{attending}} {{to some of his}} innumerable schemes, and busy with his endless lawyers. He had found time, nevertheless, to call often in Park Lane, and to <b>despatch</b> many <b>notes</b> to Rebecca, entreating her, enjoining her, commanding her to return to her young pupils in the country, who were now utterly without companionship during their mother's illness. But Miss Crawley would not hear of her departure; for though there was no lady of fashion in London who would desert her friends more complacently as soon as she was tired of their society, and though few tired of them sooner, yet as long as her engoument lasted her attachment was prodigious, and she clung still with the greatest energy to Rebecca.|$|R
60|$|During {{the whole}} of the next day the matter troubled Sir Thomas. What if Ralph should go at once to the breeches-maker's daughter,--the thought of whom made Sir Thomas very sick,--and commit himself before an answer should be {{received}} from Mr. Newton? It was only on Sunday that an idea struck him that he might still do something further to avoid the evil;--and with this object he <b>despatched</b> a <b>note</b> to Ralph, imploring him to wait for a few days before he would take any steps towards the desperate remedy of matrimony. Then he begged Ralph to call upon him again on the Wednesday morning. This note Ralph did not get till he went home on the Sunday evening;--at which time, as the reader knows, he had not as yet committed himself to the desperate remedy.|$|R
6000|$|So Mr. Taplow knew in {{five minutes}} that his guest was a brother of Sir Brian, their member; and saw the <b>note</b> <b>despatched</b> by an ostler to [...] "Mrs. Sarah Mason, Jubilee Row," [...] announcing that the Colonel had arrived, and would be with her after his dinner. Mr. Taplow did not think fit to tell his guest that the house Sir Brian used--the Blue house--was the Roebuck, not the King's Arms. Might not the gentlemen be of {{different}} politics? Mr. Taplow's wine knew none.|$|R

6000|$|At {{the hour}} named I {{appeared}} in Mrs. Makely's drawing-room {{in all the}} formality that I knew her invitation, to come very informally, really meant. I found myself the first, as I nearly always do, but I had only time for {{a word or two}} with my hostess before the others began to come. She hastily explained that as soon as she knew Mrs. Strange was in New York she had <b>despatched</b> a <b>note</b> telling her that I was still here; and that as she could not get settled in time to dine at home, she must come and take Thanksgiving dinner with her. [...] "She will have to go out with Mr. Makely; but I am going to put you next to her at table, for I want you both to have a good time. But don't you forget {{that you are going to}} take me out." ...|$|R
5000|$|It was {{estimated}} that $300,000,000 {{would be needed}} to carry the plan through. The deal collapsed in part because of financing problems on the U.S. side, and in part because it called for the development of rail into the Basra province, which did not come under Turkish control (Basra became part of the British mandate), [...] and the British-controlled Turkish Petroleum Company. The French Foreign Office, on behalf of nationals with whose claims the Chester grant conflicted, <b>despatched</b> a <b>note</b> to the Ankara government in which it characterized the whole procedure as being deliberately unfriendly. In 1923, the Ankara Assembly abruptly declared that the concession had lapsed, owing to failure of the concessionaires to fulfill in the allotted time certain conditions of the grant; but Mr Clayton Kennedy, as the representative of the syndicate, went to Ankara in person and, it was reported in 1924, succeeded in reopening the question.|$|R
6000|$|Ludwig {{took one}} of the kind broken-hearted man's hands, the hermit seized the other, and began (but on account of his great age, with a {{prolixity}} which we shall not endeavor to imitate) to narrate the events which we have already described. Let the dear reader fancy, while his Reverence speaks, the glazed eyes of the Margrave gradually lighting up with attention; the flush of joy which mantles in his countenance--the start--the throb--the almost delirious outburst of hysteric exultation with which, when the whole truth was made known, he clasped the two messengers of glad tidings to his breast, with an energy that almost choked the aged recluse! [...] "Ride, ride this instant to the Margravine--say I have wronged her, that it is all right, that she may come back--that I forgive her--that I apologize if you will"--and a secretary forthwith <b>despatched</b> a <b>note</b> to that effect, which was carried off by a fleet messenger.|$|R
6000|$|To this Lee rejoined, in a note, misdated 28th June: [...] "Sir, you cannot afford me greater {{pleasure}} than {{in giving}} me the opportunity of showing to America the sufficiency of her respective servants. I trust that temporary power of office, and the tinsel dignity attending it, will not be able, by all the mists they can raise, to obfuscate the bright rays of truth. In the meantime, your Excellency can {{have no objection to}} my retiring from the army," [...] etc. Shortly after <b>despatching</b> this <b>note,</b> Lee addressed another to Washington. [...] "I have reflected on both your situation and mine," [...] writes he, [...] "and beg leave to observe, that it will be for our mutual convenience that a court of inquiry should be immediately ordered.... I must entreat, therefore, from your love of justice, that you will immediately exhibit your charge, and that on the first halt I may be brought to a trial." ...|$|R
6000|$|One {{night we}} stayed at Reading, whence I <b>despatched</b> a <b>note</b> to my agent at Gray's Inn, saying I {{would be with}} him during the day, and begging him to procure me a lodging, and to hasten the {{preparations}} for the loan. My Lady and I agreed that {{we would go to}} France, and wait there for better times; and that night, over our supper, formed a score of plans both for pleasure and retrenchment. You would have thought it was Darby and Joan together over their supper. O woman! woman! when I recollect Lady Lyndon's smiles and blandishments--how happy she seemed to be on that night! what an air of innocent confidence appeared in her behaviour, and what affectionate names she called me!--I am lost in wonder at the depth of her hypocrisy. Who can be surprised that an unsuspecting person like myself should have been a victim to such a consummate deceiver! ...|$|R
60|$|Notwithstanding his brave threats made behind Angela's back, about {{forcing her}} to marry him in the teeth of any {{opposition}} that she could offer, George reached home that night very much disheartened about the whole business. How was he to bow the neck of this proud woman to his yoke, and break the strong cord of her allegiance to her absent lover. With many girls it might have been possible to find a way, but Angela was not an ordinary girl. He had tried, and Lady Bellamy had tried, and they had both failed, and as for Philip he would take no active part in the matter. What more could be done? Only one thing that he could think of, he could force Lady Bellamy to search her finer brains for a fresh expedient. Acting upon this idea, he at once <b>despatched</b> a <b>note</b> to her, requesting her to come and see him at Isleworth on the following morning.|$|R
6000|$|The {{next time}} I {{went to the}} house--I confess it wasn't very soon--I {{encountered}} his successor, a personage who evidently enjoyed {{the good fortune of}} never having quitted his natural level. Could any be higher? he seemed to ask--over the heads of three footmen and even of some visitors. He made me feel as if Brooksmith were dead; but I didn't dare to inquire--I couldn't have borne his [...] "I haven't the least idea, sir." [...] I <b>despatched</b> a <b>note</b> to the address that worthy had given me after Mr. Offord's death, but I received no answer. Six months later however I was favoured with a visit from an elderly dreary dingy person who introduced herself to me as Mr. Brooksmith's aunt and from whom I learned that he was out of place and out of health and had allowed her to come and say to me that if I could spare half an hour to look in at him he would take it as a rare honour.|$|R
60|$|Lawrence was a {{long time}} in coming to these conclusions, and {{it was late in the}} {{afternoon}} when he <b>despatched</b> his <b>note.</b> Having now given up his North Carolina trip--one object of which had been still another visit to Midbranch on his return--he was obliged to wait until the next day for a train to the North; and, consequently, he had another evening to devote to reflections. These, after a time, became unsatisfactory. He had told the exact truth in his note to Roberta, for he felt that it was necessary for him to leave that part of the country in order to make impossible an interview for which he believed the proper time had not arrived. He was consulting his best interests, and also, no doubt, those of the lady. And yet, in spite of this reasoning, he was not satisfied with himself. He felt that his note was not entirely honest and true. There was subterfuge about it, and something of duplicity. This he believed was foreign to his nature, and he did not like it.|$|R
6000|$|This <b>note,</b> <b>despatched</b> by {{the same}} {{messenger}} who had carried the invitation to Chopper on the previous day, alarmed the worthy clerk not a little. It was inclosed to him, and {{as he opened the}} letter he trembled lest the dinner should be put off on which he was calculating. His mind was inexpressibly relieved when he found that the envelope was only a reminder for himself. ("I shall expect you at half-past five," [...] Captain Dobbin wrote.) He was very much interested about his employer's family; but, que voulez-vous? a grand dinner was of more concern to him than the affairs of any other mortal.|$|R
60|$|Morgan's master was {{sincerely}} vexed at {{hearing of}} Arthur's calamity. He {{would have gone}} to him, but what good could it do Arthur that he, the Major, should catch a fever? His own ailments rendered it absolutely impossible that he should attend to anybody but himself. But the young man must have advice--the best advice; and Morgan was straightway <b>despatched</b> with a <b>note</b> from Major Pendennis to his friend Doctor Goodenough, who by good luck happened to be in London and at home, and who quitted his dinner instantly, and whose carriage was in half an hour in Upper Temple Lane, near Pen's chambers.|$|R
