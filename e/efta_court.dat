40|$|This book {{collects}} a {{large number}} of essays written in honour of Professor Ernst-Ulrich Petersmann by his friends, colleagues and former students. The respective contributions cover the fields of International Economic Law, International Constitutional Law/Transnational Constitutionalism, EU Law and Human Rights. The broad thematic scope of this book mirrors the extremely large field of interests of the jubilarian. Paying tribute to a particular trait of Professor Petersmann´s character who was always both a dogmatic thinker and a curious researcher, the authors try to cover both structural issues of law as well as most recent developments, in particular in the field of International Economic Law. “Construing” the constitution of International Economic Law, in both senses of this activity, was an aim throughout Professor Petersmann´s academic career and this goal stands also {{at the heart of this}} book.

5000|$|According to Article 108(2) of the EEA Agreement of 2 May 1992, the EFTA States {{taking part}} in the EEA Agreement shall {{establish}} a court of justice. That obligation was complied with by the conclusion of the [...] "Surveillance and Court Agreement" [...] (SCA), cf. Art. 27. The <b>EFTA</b> <b>Court</b> was originally designed for the then seven EFTA States Austria, Finland, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. On 1 January 1994, upon the entry into force of the EEA Agreement, the <b>EFTA</b> <b>Court</b> took up its functions with five judges nominated by Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. Switzerland was unable to ratify the EEA Agreement due to a negative referendum. Liechtenstein postponed membership until 1 May 1995. In 1995, Austria, Finland and Sweden left EFTA and joined the EU. Since September 1995, the <b>EFTA</b> <b>Court</b> has consisted of three judges and six ad hoc judges nominated by the three actual EEA/EFTA States Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway and appointed by their Governments through common accord.|$|E
5000|$|In Case E-2/03 Ásgeirsson'''', {{one of the}} {{defendants}} in the national proceedings had alleged that the reference of {{the case to the}} <b>EFTA</b> <b>Court</b> prolonged the duration of the proceedings and thereby infringed Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The <b>EFTA</b> <b>Court</b> held that provisions of the EEA Agreement as well as procedural provisions of the SCA are to be interpreted in the light of fundamental rights and that the provisions of the European Convention of Human Rights and the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights are important sources for determining the scope of these rights. With regard to the right to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time granted by Article 6(1) ECHR, the <b>EFTA</b> <b>Court</b> observed that the European Court of Human Rights held in a case concerning a delay of two years and seven months due to a reference by a national court to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling, that this period of time could not be taken into consideration in the assessment of the length of a particular set of proceedings. To take it into account would adversely affect the system instituted by what is now Article 267 TFEU and work against the aim pursued in substance in that Article, as seen in Case Pafitis. The <b>EFTA</b> <b>Court</b> held that the same must apply with regard to the procedure established under Article 34 of the SCA which, as a means of inter-court cooperation, contributes to the proper functioning of the EEA Agreement to the benefit of individuals and economic operators. The <b>EFTA</b> <b>Court</b> added that, the time period from the registration of the request to the delivery of judgment amounted to a little more than five months.|$|E

50|$|The <b>EFTA</b> <b>Court</b> has {{consistently}} {{held that the}} provisions of the EEA Agreement are intended for the benefit of individuals and economic operators throughout the European Economic Area and that the proper functioning of the EEA Agreement is dependent on those individuals and economic operators being able to rely on the rights before the national courts of EEA/EFTA States.|$|E
50|$|The EEA {{is based}} in a two pillar structure, the EU constituting one pillar and the three {{participating}} EFTA States the other. In substance, the EEA Agreement has extended the EU single market to the participating EFTA States. EEA law is therefore largely identical to EU law. In order to secure {{a level playing field}} for individuals and economic operators in both pillars, special homogeneity provisions have been laid down in the EEA Agreement and in the Surveillance and Court Agreement. Under these rules, the <b>EFTA</b> <b>Court</b> shall follow the relevant case law of the ECJ on provisions of Union law that are identical in substance to provisions of EEA law rendered prior to the date of signature of the EEA Agreement (2 May 1992) and shall pay due account to the principles laid down by the European Court of Justice's relevant case law rendered after that date. The EFTA Court’s jurisprudence is in fact based on the case law of the European Court of Justice (ECJ). The politically important distinction between old and new ECJ case law has largely been qualified in practice. The <b>EFTA</b> <b>Court</b> also refers to the case law of the General Court of the European Union (EGC). All three EEA courts (ECJ, EGC, <b>EFTA</b> <b>Court)</b> have not only emphasized the need for a uniform interpretation of EU and EEA law, but have actively seen to it that homogeneity is preserved.|$|E
50|$|By contrast, {{judgments}} or advisory opinions {{under the}} original {{jurisdiction of the}} Court are published in a single judgment of the court once the majority of judges have reached a conclusion after final deliberation.
