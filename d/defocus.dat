The {{presence of these}} two opposing factors implies {{a point at which}} the combined blur spot is minimized (Gibson 1975, 64); at that point, the f-number is optimal for image sharpness, for this given depth of field– a wider aperture (lower f-number) causes more <b>defocus,</b> while a narrower aperture (higher f-number) causes more diffraction.|$|E

30|$|An image <b>defocusing</b> {{technique}} {{has been used}} in <b>Defocusing</b> Digital Particle Image Velocimetry (DDPIV) for 3 D particle tracking and 3 D flow measurement [5, 6]. This imaging {{technique has}} been extended to microflow applications such as the micro image <b>defocusing</b> technique [7.8. 9.10]. Within this field, several authors have described the effects of fluid RI in the image <b>defocusing</b> for the purpose of z-compensation for fluid RIs when using (μ−) DDPIV [6, 9, 10]. It is therefore plausible that the image <b>defocusing</b> technique might be applied to the measurement of RI using a simple optical layout. A micro-refractometer that used micro image <b>defocusing</b> and a microfluidic device was reported previously [11] but the authors gave no details of its optical configuration; however, they demonstrated the use of the image <b>defocusing</b> technique for RI measurement.|$|R

25|$|Analysis of {{diffraction}} patterns beyond point-position can be complex, as {{the image}} is sensitive {{to a number of}} factors such as specimen thickness and orientation, objective lens <b>defocus,</b> spherical and chromatic aberration. Although quantitative interpretation of the contrast shown in lattice images is possible, it is inherently complicated and can require extensive computer simulation and analysis, such as electron multislice analysis.|$|E
25|$|An {{extension}} of the two-bar case to a grating consisting of many horizontal lines shows similar sensitivity to <b>defocus.</b> It is manifest in the CD difference between {{the top and bottom}} edge lines of the set of 11 horizontal lines. The table below lists the CD difference over 100 nm focus range under quasar illumination (quasar illumination will be described in the section on optimum illumination vs. pitch).|$|E
25|$|If {{the camera}} {{position}} and image framing (i.e., angle of view) have been chosen, {{the only means}} of controlling DOF is the lens aperture. Most DOF formulas imply that any arbitrary DOF can be achieved by using a sufficiently large f-number. Because of diffraction, however, this isn't really true. Once a lens is stopped down to where most aberrations are well corrected, stopping down further will decrease sharpness in the plane of focus. At the DOF limits, however, further stopping down decreases the size of the <b>defocus</b> blur spot, and the overall sharpness may still increase. Eventually, the <b>defocus</b> blur spot becomes negligibly small, and further stopping down serves only to decrease sharpness even at DOF limits (Gibson 1975, 64). There is thus a tradeoff between sharpness in the POF and sharpness at the DOF limits. But the sharpness in the POF is always greater than that at the DOF limits; if the blur at the DOF limits is imperceptible, the blur in the POF is imperceptible as well.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} paper, we study the <b>defocusing</b> complex short pulse (CSP) {{equations}} both geometrically and algebraically. From the geometric point of view, we establish a link {{of the complex}} coupled dispersionless (CCD) system with the motion of space curves in Minkowski space R^ 2, 1, then with the <b>defocusing</b> CSP equation via a hodograph (reciprocal) transformation, the Lax pair is constructed naturally for the <b>defocusing</b> CSP equation. We also show that the CCD system of both the focusing and <b>defocusing</b> types {{can be derived from}} the fundamental forms of surfaces such that their curve flows are formulated. In {{the second part of the}} paper, we derive the the <b>defocusing</b> CSP equation from the single-component extended KP hierarchy by the reduction method. As a by-product, the N-dark soliton solution for the <b>defocusing</b> CSP equation in the form of determinants for these equations is provided. Comment: 27 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|Focusing and <b>defocusing</b> {{of laser}} light has been {{observed}} for many years. Kerr type materials exhibit this effect but only for high intensities. We show experimental evidence that photorefractive materials can also produce dramatic focusing and <b>defocusing.</b> Whereas Kerr materials produce this effect for high intensities, photorefractive materials produce these effects independent of intensity indicating that this effect would be ideal for an optical limiter. We compare the characteristics of Kerr and photorefractive materials, discuss the physical models for both materials and present experimental evidence for photorefractive <b>defocusing.</b> Self-focusing and <b>defocusing</b> was observed for any incident polarization although the effect was more pronounced using extraordinary polarized light. In addition, self-focusing or <b>defocusing</b> could be observed depending on {{the direction of the}} applied electric field. When the applied field was {{in the same direction as}} the crystal spontaneous polarization, focusing was observed. When the applied field was opposite the material spontaneous polarization, the incident laser light was dramatically <b>defocused...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{anterior}} median eyes (AME) {{have very}} good vision. This pair of eyes is built like a telescopic tube with a corneal lens {{in the front and}} a second lens in the back that focus images onto a four-layered retina, a narrow boomerang-shaped strip oriented vertically. Physiological experiments have shown they may have up to four different kinds of receptor cells, with different absorption spectra, giving them the possibility of up to tetrachromatic color vision, with sensitivity extending into the ultraviolet range. As the eyes are too close together to allow depth perception, and the animals do not make use of motion parallax, they have evolved a method called image <b>defocus</b> instead. Of the four photoreceptor layers in the retina, the first two closest to the surface contain ultraviolet-sensitive pigments while the two deepest contain green-sensitive pigments. The incoming green light is only focused on the deepest layer, while the other one receives defocused or fuzzy images. By measuring the amount of <b>defocus</b> from the fuzzy layer, it is possible to calculate the distance to the objects in front of them. In addition to receptor cells, also red filters have been detected, located in front of the cells that normally register green light. It seems that all salticids, regardless of whether they have two, three, or four kinds of color receptors, are highly sensitive to UV light. Some species (for example, Cosmophasis umbratica) are highly dimorphic in the UV spectrum, suggesting a role in sexual signaling (Lim & Li, 2005). Color discrimination has been demonstrated in behavioral experiments.|$|E
25|$|Hansma (1996) and Peterson (1996) have {{discussed}} determining the combined effects of <b>defocus</b> and diffraction using a root-square {{combination of the}} individual blur spots. Hansma's approach determines the f-number that will give the maximum possible sharpness; Peterson's approach determines the minimum f-number that will give the desired sharpness in the final image, and yields a maximum focus spread for which the desired sharpness can be achieved.-number, though such an expression obtains from simple algebraic manipulation of his Equation3. In combination, the two methods {{can be regarded as}} giving a maximum and minimum f-number for a given situation, with the photographer free to choose any value within the range, as conditions (e.g., potential motion blur) permit. Gibson (1975), 64) gives a similar discussion, additionally considering blurring effects of camera lens aberrations, enlarging lens diffraction and aberrations, the negative emulsion, and the printing paper. Couzin (1982) gave a formula essentially the same as Hansma's for optimal f-number, but did not discuss its derivation.|$|E
25|$|Different imaging methods {{therefore}} {{attempt to}} modify the electron waves exiting the sample {{in a way that}} provides information about the sample, or the beam itself. From the previous equation, it can be deduced that the observed image depends not only on the amplitude of beam, but also on the phase of the electrons, although phase effects may often be ignored at lower magnifications. Higher resolution imaging requires thinner samples and higher energies of incident electrons, which means that the sample can no longer be considered to be absorbing electrons (i.e., via a Beer's law effect). Instead, the sample can be modeled as an object that does not change the amplitude of the incoming electron wave function, but instead modifies the phase of the incoming wave; in this model, the sample is known as a pure phase object. For sufficiently thin specimens, phase effects dominate the image, complicating analysis of the observed intensities. To improve the contrast in the image, the TEM may be operated at a slight <b>defocus</b> to enhance contrast, owing to convolution by the contrast transfer function of the TEM, which would normally decrease contrast if the sample was not a weak phase object.|$|E
30|$|Optimized {{dithering}} {{fringe pattern}} is a promising method for high-speed, high-accuracy three-dimensional shape measurement. The recently proposed dithering optimization technology optimizes the fringe quality in either phase domain or intensity domain {{according to their}} objective functions. Phase-based optimization is direct and effective, but it is sensitive to projector <b>defocusing</b> levels. Intensity-based optimization is robust to projector <b>defocusing</b> levels, {{but it does not}} fully improve the phase quality. In practice, it is difficult to control <b>defocusing</b> levels so it is still a challenge to get high quality fringe patterns which affects the measurement quality under different <b>defocusing</b> levels.|$|R
30|$|The {{proposed}} method can {{get high}} quality binary dithered patterns under different <b>defocusing</b> levels by combining global similarity and local structure similarity. The proposed method {{can improve the}} robustness to the amounts of <b>defocusing.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Defocused</b> spot {{parameters}} of an optical system were {{measured by a}} testing system with CCD microscopic imaging quantitatively, and an evaluating method for the <b>defocused</b> spot parameters was designed. Firstly, the definitions of the <b>defocused</b> spot parameters including the diameter and the roundness were given. The connected region shaped by the energy contour of the <b>defocused</b> spots was analyzed, and the diameter equal to the area which is 80 % of the total energy of the <b>defocused</b> spots was calculated. Then, the boundary of the region was fitted as an ellipse and the roundness of <b>defocused</b> spot was obtained. The method introduces the ellipse fit into the <b>defocused</b> spot roundness measurement through analysis of the energy distribution of star point image on image plane, so {{that the effects of}} CCD noise and stray light in test environment on the measuring results are reduced and the confidence of the test results is improved. The experimental results show that the repeatability of the diameter is 0. 18 μm and that of the roundness is 1. 65 %. The method meets the needs of the optical systems in space projects for the imaging quality control. ©, 2015, Chinese Academy of Sciences. All right reserved...|$|R
500|$|The {{cathode-ray}} tube {{amusement device}} {{consists of a}} cathode ray tube connected to an oscilloscope {{with a set of}} knobs and switches. The device uses purely analog electronics and does not use any digital computer or memory device or execute a program. The CRT projects a spot on the oscilloscope display screen, which traces a parabolic arc across the screen when a switch is activated by the player. This beam spot represents the trajectory of an artillery shell. Overlaid on the screen are transparent plastic targets representing objects such as airplanes. At the end of the spot's trajectory, the beam defocuses, resulting in the spot expanding and blurring. This represents the shell exploding as if detonated by a time fuze. The goal of the game is to have the beam <b>defocus</b> when it is within the bounds of a target. Prior to the beam spot beginning its arc, the player can turn the control knobs to direct the beam spot's trajectory and adjust the delay of the shell burst. The machine can be set to fire a [...] "shell" [...] either once or at a regular interval, which is adjustable by the player. This gives the player the goal of hitting one of the overlay targets with the shell burst within a time limit. The player was recommended to make the trajectory far removed from a straight line [...] "so as to require an increased amount of skill and care".|$|E
2500|$|The {{off-axis}} illumination of the reticle {{is also the}} cause of non-telecentricity in wafer <b>defocus,</b> which consumes most of the 1.4 nm overlay budget of the NXE:3400 EUV scanner even for design rules as loose as 100nm pitch. In particular, the worst uncorrectable pattern placement error for a 24 nm line was about 1.1 nm, relative to an adjacent 72 nm power line, per 80 nm wafer focus position shift at a single slit position; when across-slit performance is included, the worst error is over 1.5 nm in the wafer <b>defocus</b> window ...|$|E
2500|$|The use of {{reflection}} causes wafer exposure {{position to be}} extremely sensitive to the reticle flatness and the reticle clamp. Reticle clamp cleanliness is therefore required to be maintained. Small (mrad-scale) deviations in mask flatness in the local slope, coupled with wafer <b>defocus.</b> More significantly, mask <b>defocus</b> {{has been found to}} result in large overlay errors. [...] In particular, for a 10nm node metal 1 layer (including 48 nm, 64 nm, 70 nm pitches, isolated, and power lines), the uncorrectable pattern placement error was 1 nm for 40 nm mask z-position shift. This is a global pattern shift of the layer with respect to previously defined layers. However, features at different locations will also shift differently due to different local deviations from mask flatness, e.g., from defects buried under the multilayer. It can be estimated that the contribution of mask non-flatness to overlay error is roughly 1/40 times the peak-to-valley thickness variation. With the blank thickness variation up to 80 nm being possible, ~2 nm image placement error is possible.|$|E
30|$|Moving object {{tracking}} and imaging {{is an important}} problem in a wide-range of radar systems and applications including emerging systems such as radars with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components or software-defined radio (SDR)-based radars, which have attracted interest in recent years. Imaging of moving objects is a challenging problem for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) as an imaging radar. Moving objects in the scene cause phase errors in the SAR data and subsequently <b>defocusing</b> in images reconstructed based on a stationary scene assumption. The <b>defocusing</b> caused by moving objects exhibits space-variant characteristics, i.e., the <b>defocusing</b> arises only in {{the parts of the}} image containing the moving objects, whereas the stationary background is not <b>defocused.</b> This type of <b>defocusing</b> can be removed by estimating two sets of unknowns, which are the locations of the moving objects in the scene and the velocities of the objects or the corresponding phase errors.|$|R
30|$|These {{results also}} clearly show that phase-based {{optimization}} technology can improve phase quality under a certain condition {{but it is}} sensitive {{to the amount of}} <b>defocusing.</b> The intensity-based optimization technology is able to improve the fringe quality with the <b>defocusing</b> levels increasing, but it can not reduce phase errors efficiently. The proposed technique has the same tendency with intensity-based optimization but it can increase the phase quality under different <b>defocusing</b> levels. The results are consistent with the simulation analysis.|$|R

2500|$|Image {{sharpness}} {{is related}} to f/number through two different optical effects: aberration, due to imperfect lens design, [...] and diffraction {{which is due to}} the wave nature of light. The blur optimal f-stop varies with the lens design. For modern standard lenses having 6 or 7 elements, the sharpest image is often obtained around 5.6–8, while for older standard lenses having only 4 elements (Tessar formula) stopping to 11 will give the sharpest image. The larger number of elements in modern lenses allow the designer to compensate for aberrations, allowing the lens to give better pictures at lower f-numbers. Even if aberration is minimized by using the best lenses, diffraction creates some spreading of the rays causing <b>defocus.</b> To offset that use the largest lens opening diameter possible (not the f/ number itself).|$|E
2500|$|Ocular aberrations are distortions in the {{wavefront}} {{passing through}} the pupil of the eye. These optical aberrations diminish {{the quality of the}} image formed on the retina, sometimes necessitating the wearing of spectacles or contact lenses. In the case of retinal imaging, light passing out of the eye carries similar wavefront distortions, leading to an inability to resolve the microscopic structure (cells and capillaries) of the retina. Spectacles and contact lenses correct [...] "low-order aberrations", such as <b>defocus</b> and astigmatism, which tend to be stable in humans {{for long periods of time}} (months or years). While correction of these is sufficient for normal visual functioning, it is generally insufficient to achieve microscopic resolution. Additionally, [...] "high-order aberrations", such as coma, spherical aberration, and trefoil, must also be corrected in order to achieve microscopic resolution. High-order aberrations, unlike low-order, are not stable over time, and may change over time scales of 0.1s to 0.01s. The correction of these aberrations requires continuous, high-frequency measurement and compensation.|$|E
2500|$|Precise {{focus is}} {{possible}} at only one distance; at that distance, a point object {{will produce a}} point image. At any other distance, a point object is defocused, and will produce a blur spot shaped like the aperture, which {{for the purpose of}} analysis is usually assumed to be circular. When this circular spot is sufficiently small, it is indistinguishable from a point, and appears to be in focus; it is rendered as [...] "acceptably sharp". The diameter of the circle increases with distance from the point of focus; the largest circle that is indistinguishable from a point is known as the acceptable circle of confusion, or informally, simply as the circle of confusion. The acceptable circle of confusion is influenced by visual acuity, viewing conditions, and the amount by which the image is enlarged (Ray 2000, 52–53). The increase of the circle diameter with <b>defocus</b> is gradual, so the limits of depth of field are not hard boundaries between sharp and unsharp.|$|E
40|$|Neutral atoms {{entering}} {{an electric}} field experience a <b>defocusing</b> {{force in the}} dipole field direction, which {{is proportional to the}} field gradient. If an experiment, such as the search for a permanent electron electric dipole moment (eEDM), requires a very strong electric field (13. 5 [*][*]MV/m), then this end-field <b>defocusing</b> results in beam blowup and much reduced phase-space acceptance. In this paper we discuss how these <b>defocusing</b> fields arise from the longitudinal changes in the electric dipole field and their dependence on the electrode shape and spacing between lenses. We find that the end-field <b>defocusing</b> comes from strong impulse forces, whose <b>defocusing</b> power was calculated for simple electrodes with rounded ends. To compensate for this end-field <b>defocusing,</b> a triplet of transverse-focusing lenses was added to the pure dipole field plates in the generic eEDM cesium fountain experiment used to study the neutral beam optics. Envelope equations, which calculated the beam sizes of the atom bunch for the linear forces, are used to obtain a set of lens parameters that give a well focused beam in the fountain. Atom trajectory equations allow us to calculate the phase-space acceptance of the lens system with the nonlinear force terms included...|$|R

However, the syntactic nature of English object omission {{does not seem to be}} explained properly by his parameter. In this paper, it will be proposed that object omission involves movement to the edge of vP, in parallel with p-movement, another <b>defocusing</b> phenomenon. The Phase Theory constrains <b>defocusing.</b> In addition, <b>defocused</b> DPs are optionally assigned null Case which makes them invisible to phonology. Null-Case assignment is parameterized.
