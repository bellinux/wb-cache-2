40|$|AbstractThe TRAPP vesicle-tethering complex {{consists}} {{of more than}} 10 distinct polypeptides and is involved in protein transport. Using the C 2 subunit as bait we identified SPATA 4, a spermatocyte-specific protein of unknown function, as an interacting partner in a yeast two hybrid screen. Further studies indicate SPATA 4 <b>interacts</b> <b>with</b> the C 2 portion of the TRAPP complex. SPATA 4 fractionates with both cytosolic and nuclear fractions suggesting it may have several distinct functions. SPATA 4 {{is one of only}} three human proteins that contain a DUF 1042 domain and we show that C 2 does not <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> another one of the DUF 1042 domain-containing proteins. Our results suggest a role for SPATA 4 in membrane traffic and a specialized function for TRAPP in spermatocytes.

5|$|Hurricane Humberto was {{a minimal}} {{hurricane}} that formed and intensified {{faster than any}} other North Atlantic tropical cyclone on record before landfall. Developing on September 12, 2007, in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, the tropical cyclone rapidly strengthened and struck High Island, Texas, with winds of about 90mph (150km/h) early on September 13.

5|$|Hurricane Iris was {{the ninth}} named storm and fifth {{hurricane}} of the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season. Iris {{was the first}} of three tropical cyclones to affect the Lesser Antilles in a three-week period, preceding the more destructive hurricanes Luis and Marilyn. It developed from a tropical wave to the east of the Lesser Antilles on August22 and attained hurricane status within 30hours. The hurricane weakened to a tropical storm before crossing the islands of the eastern Caribbean from August26 through August28. During that time, Iris became one of four active tropical storms in the Atlantic basin. Earlier it had <b>interacted</b> <b>with</b> Hurricane Humberto, and beginning on August30, Iris <b>interacted</b> <b>with</b> Tropical Storm Karen. Iris re-intensified into a hurricane and attained peak sustained winds of 110mph (175km/h) while moving slowly across the central Atlantic. The hurricane accelerated to the north and absorbed a dissipating Tropical Depression Karen on September3. Iris weakened to a tropical storm and became extratropical on September4, though its remnants reattained hurricane-force winds before affecting western Europe on September7.|$|E

40|$|AbstractNel-like protein 1 (NELL- 1) is an osteoinductive {{molecule}} {{associated with}} premature calvarial suture closure. Here we identified apoptosis related protein 3 (APR 3), a membrane protein {{known as a}} proliferation suppressor, as a binding protein of NELL- 1 by biopanning. NELL- 1 and APR 3 colocalized on the nuclear envelope of human osteoblasts. NELL- 1 significantly inhibited proliferation of osteoblasts co-transfected with APR 3 through further down-regulation of Cyclin D 1. The co-expression of NELL- 1 and APR 3 enhanced Ocn and Bsp expression and mineralization. RNAi of APR 3 significantly reduced the differentiation effect of NELL- 1. These {{findings suggest that the}} effects of NELL- 1 on osteoblastic differentiation and proliferation are partly through binding to APR 3.
