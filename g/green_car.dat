25|$|Holden {{announced}} on December 22, 2008 that its Elizabeth, South Australia production line would be split to commence local {{production of the}} Cruze sedan and the Australian-developed hatchback. Production was originally scheduled to start by September 2010. However, it was confirmed in January 2010 that production would in fact begin in March 2011. The announcement to assemble the car came {{as a response to}} the slowing sales of the larger, locally produced Holden Commodore range. The Australian Government committed 149million to the program from its $6.2billion <b>Green</b> <b>Car</b> Innovation Fund, with a further $30million given by the State Government of South Australia. GM Holden matched both amounts, but the then chairman and managing director Mark Reuss would not reveal Holden's total investment. Reuss announced his firm would be considering the utilization of liquid petroleum gas (LPG), compressed natural gas (CNG), ethanol (E85) flexible-fuel and petrol/electric hybrid start-stop system powertrain technologies. These technologies, if materialized, would supplement the four-cylinder petrol and diesel powertrain offerings already confirmed by Holden at the time of the announcement.|$|E
