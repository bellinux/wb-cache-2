5|$|With {{the fuel}} price {{increases}} of the 2000s, the EPA and many companies {{have sought to}} increase diesel truck fuel economy. One such example is the hydraulic <b>hybrid</b> <b>vehicle,</b> which stores energy in hydraulic tanks and hydraulic motors (as opposed to the electric <b>hybrid</b> <b>vehicle</b> which uses batteries and regenerative brakes). Electric hybrid vehicles are another option, with savings of 35 to 60 percent over traditional vehicles. Drivers themselves may improve fuel efficiency by using a method called progressive shifting, in which the driver shifts through the gears (typical trucks may have between 10 and 18 gears) {{in such a manner}} as to optimize the power range of the engine.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of {{increased}} sales of hybrid electric vehicles in several countries, {{some members of the}} blind community have raised concerns about the noise reduction when those vehicles operate in all-electric mode, as blind people or the visually impaired consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets and feel quiet hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard. Although a 2009 study found no statistically significant difference in pedestrian crashes involving quiet hybrid vehicles when compared to noisier vehicles when both types of vehicles were travelling in a straight line, it found a doubling of <b>hybrid</b> <b>vehicle</b> pedestrian crashes when reversing or parking etc. at slow speeds.|$|E

The act does not stipulate a specific speed for the simulated noise but requires the U.S. Department of Transportation to study and establish a motor vehicle safety standard that would set requirements for an alert sound that allows blind and other pedestrians to reasonably detect a nearby electric or <b>hybrid</b> <b>vehicle,</b> and the ruling must be finalized within eighteen months. The bill was signed into law by President Barack Obama on January 4, 2011.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of the Lexus brand in the Japanese {{domestic}} market in 2005, Lexus sanctioned the entry of four SC 430 coupes in the Super GT series of the All Japan Grand Touring Car Championship in the GT500 class. In the first race of the 2006 series, an SC 430 took the chequered flag, and drivers André Lotterer and Juichi Wakisaka raced the SC 430 to capture the GT500 championship for that year. In 2007, another SC 430 won the GT500 opening round race. In 2006, Lexus raced a <b>hybrid</b> <b>vehicle</b> for the first time, entering a GS 450h performance hybrid sedan in partnership with Sigma Advanced Racing Development at the 24 Hours of Tokachi race in Hokkaido, Japan. Lexus Canada also entered the GS 450h in 2007's Targa Newfoundland event. In 2009, Lexus Super GT Team SC 430 and IS 350 racers won the GT500 and GT300 championships, respectively.|$|E

40|$|Electric or <b>hybrid</b> <b>vehicles</b> are {{becoming}} increasingly common on roads. While electric vehicles are still more or less intended for city traffic, <b>hybrid</b> <b>vehicles</b> allow normal use due to wider driving range. The use of internal combustion engines in hybrid drives is still an inspiration to find the {{way to reduce the}} produc-tion of emissions. Numbers of alternative energy resources were studied as a substitution of conventional fuels for <b>hybrid</b> <b>vehicles</b> drives worldwide. The paper deals with the possibility of using alternative fuels as CNG, LPG and LNG in combination with hybrid drive of a midibus with the capacity of 20 passengers. Various aspects and techniques of <b>hybrid</b> <b>vehicles</b> from energy management system, propulsion system and using of various alternative fuels are explored in this paper.
