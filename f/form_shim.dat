40|$|Purpose of this diploma {{thesis is}} a {{design of a}} {{compound}} tool for manufacturing the <b>form</b> <b>shim.</b> The <b>form</b> <b>shim</b> is made by shearing and bending technology from steel sheet 11 343. 1. Thickness is 2 mm. On {{the basis of a}} literary study and design calculations was designed the compound tool, which will manufacture this component by 4 actions on the automated line containing rewinder, feeding levelling machine and eccentric press with designed compound tool. Economic calculations show that the designed manufacturing is profitable...|$|E
50|$|The {{distinction}} that Sharp makes is: What makes a polyfill {{different from the}} techniques we have already, like a shim, is this: if you removed the polyfill script, your code would continue to work, without any changes required {{in spite of the}} polyfill being removed. This distinction is not drawn by other authors. At times various other distinctions are drawn between shims, polyfills, and fallbacks, but there are no generally accepted distinctions: most consider polyfills a <b>form</b> of <b>shim.</b> The term polyfiller is also occasionally found.|$|R
40|$|In the work, a {{mathematical}} model of a shim valve, used in monotube shock absorbers, designed to determine the deformations of the <b>shims</b> which <b>form</b> during the exploitation of the shock absorbers, is presented. The characteristic of the damping force formed by the shock absorber depends on the deformations. In the designed model, the amount, geometric dimensions, arrangement and the material properties of the shims are evaluated, and the contact forces, which <b>form</b> between the <b>shims,</b> are determined. The described model of the shim valve {{is presented in the}} environment of the software package MATLAB/Simulink, the analysis of the designed model is done using the software package ANSYS 15. 0...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the fact}} that much of the field of the quadrupoles was outside the iron (in {{particular}} with the wide quadrupoles) and that thus the fields of quadrupoles and bending magnets interacted, the lattice properties of the AA could not be predicted with the required accuracy. After a first running period in 1980, during which detailed measurements were made with proton test beams, corrections to the quadrupoles were made in 1981, in the <b>form</b> of laminated <b>shims</b> at the ends of the poles, and with steel washers. With the latter ones, further refinements were made in an iterative procedure with measurements on the circulating beam. This eventually resulted, amongst other things, in a very low chromaticity, with the Q-values being constant to within +- 0. 001 over the total momentum range of 6 %. Here we see the shims and washers on a narrow qudrupole (QFN, QDN). See also 8103203, 8103204, 8103205, 8103206...|$|R
40|$|Parallel {{radiofrequency}} (RF) transmission, {{either in}} the <b>form</b> of RF <b>shimming</b> or pulse design, has been proposed {{as a solution to}} the View the MathML sourceB 1 + inhomogeneity problem in ultra high field magnetic resonance imaging. As a prerequisite, accurate View the MathML sourceB 1 + maps from each of the available transmit channels are required. In this work, four different encoding methods for View the MathML sourceB 1 + mapping, namely 1 -channel-on, all-channels-on-except- 1, all-channels-on- 1 -inverted and Fourier phase encoding, were evaluated using dual refocusing acquisition mode (DREAM) at 9. 4 T. Fourier phase encoding was demonstrated in both phantom and in vivo to be the least susceptible to artefacts caused by destructive RF interference at 9. 4 T. Unlike the other two interferometric encoding schemes, Fourier phase encoding showed negligible dependency on the initial RF phase setting and therefore no prior View the MathML sourceB 1 + knowledge is required. Fourier phase encoding also provides a flexible way {{to increase the number of}} measurements to increase SNR, and to allow further reduction of artefacts by weighted decoding. These advantages of Fourier phase encoding suggest that it is a good choice for View the MathML sourceB 1 + mapping in parallel transmit systems at ultra high field...|$|R
40|$|The basic {{results on}} {{modeling}} the magnetic {{system of the}} cyclotron CYTREC in the scale 1 : 2. 5 are presented. The model of the magnetic system of the cyclotron CYTREC is designed and produced for a choice of the <b>form</b> of sector <b>shims,</b> which <b>form</b> a required average magnetic field. The cyclotron is made for acceleration of heavy mass ions with the relation of weight to the charge A/Z approx = 5 up to the energy W= 2. 4 MeV/nucleon. The extracted beam (approx 10 sup 1 sup 1 sec sup - sup 1) is intended for manufacture of track membranes. For the cyclotron a sh-shape electromagnet with the diameter of poles 1600 mm and gap between them delta= 100 mm is used. The variation of the magnetic field is created by a system of 4 pairs of sector shims fixed on poles in axial symmetry, forming the radial-sector structure of a field such as Thomas shape with the periodicity N= 4. The minimal gap between the shims is accepted equal to h sub 1 = 40 mm, and their height makes b= 30 mm. The chosen parameters of the sector shims provide axial stability of the accelerated particles 0 <Q sub z < 0. 5...|$|R
