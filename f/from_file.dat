25|$|The {{commands}} themselves could {{sometimes be}} obscure. For instance, the command to duplicate files was named PIP (Peripheral-Interchange-Program), {{the name of}} the old DEC utility used for that purpose. The format of parameters given to a program was not standardized, so that there was no single option character that differentiated options <b>from</b> <b>file</b> names. Different programs could and did use different characters.|$|E

25|$|Windows Search uses {{property}} handlers {{to handle}} metadata <b>from</b> <b>file</b> formats. A property handler needs a property description and a schema {{for the property}} for Windows Search to index the metadata. Protocol handlers are used for indexing specific data stores. For example, files are accessed using File System Protocol Handler, Microsoft Office Outlook data stores using the Outlook Protocol Handler and Internet Explorer cache using the IE History/Cache Protocol Handler.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{solid-state}} memory, {{hard drives}} {{are susceptible to}} damage by shock (e.g., a short fall) and vibration, have limitations on use at high altitude, and although they are shielded by their casings, they are vulnerable when exposed to strong magnetic fields. In terms of overall mass, hard drives are usually larger and heavier than flash drives; however, hard disks sometimes weigh less per unit of storage. Like flash drives, hard disks also suffer <b>from</b> <b>file</b> fragmentation, which can reduce access speed.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{method that}} can detect {{rootkits}} compares [...] "trusted" [...] raw data with [...] "tainted" [...] content returned by an API. For example, binaries present on disk {{can be compared}} with their copies within operating memory (in some operating systems, the in-memory image should be identical to the on-disk image), or the results returned <b>from</b> <b>file</b> system or Windows Registry APIs can be checked against raw structures on the underlying physical disks—however, {{in the case of}} the former, some valid differences can be introduced by operating system mechanisms like memory relocation or shimming. A rootkit may detect the presence of a such difference-based scanner or virtual machine (the latter being commonly used to perform forensic analysis), and adjust its behaviour so that no differences can be detected. Difference-based detection was used by Russinovich's RootkitRevealer tool to find the Sony DRM rootkit.|$|E
