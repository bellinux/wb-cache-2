5|$|This {{provides}} a definition {{for the moment}} of <b>inertia,</b> which is the rotational equivalent for mass. In more advanced treatments of mechanics, where the rotation over a time interval is described, the moment of <b>inertia</b> must be substituted by the tensor that, when properly analyzed, fully determines the characteristics of rotations including precession and nutation.|$|E
5|$|Of {{concern to}} breeders is the {{condition}} known as uterine <b>inertia,</b> {{an inability to}} expel the foetus due to weak muscles. This condition was present {{in one of the}} foundation cats and appears in some Singapura females today. Individuals with uterine <b>inertia</b> may require deliveries to be made by Caesarean section. Another issue that affects the breed is Pyruvate kinase deficiency, which leads to hemolytic anemia. Typical symptoms includes lethargy, diarrhea, lack of appetite, poor coat quality, weight loss and jaundice.|$|E
5|$|Turning {{forces are}} {{generated}} during maneuvers for balancing {{in addition to}} just changing direction of travel. These may be interpreted as centrifugal forces in the accelerating reference frame of the bike and rider; or simply as <b>inertia</b> in a stationary, inertial reference frame and not forces at all. Gyroscopic forces acting on rotating parts such as wheels, engine, transmission, etc., are also due to the <b>inertia</b> of those rotating parts. They are discussed further in the section on gyroscopic effects below.|$|E

40|$|Camera robots are {{high-speed}} redundantly cable-driven parallel manipulators that {{realize the}} aerial panoramic photographing. When long-span cables and high maneuverability are involved, {{the effects of}} cable sags and <b>inertias</b> on the dynamics must be carefully dealt with. This paper {{is devoted to the}} optimal cable tension distribution (OCTD for short) of the camera robots. Firstly, each fast varying-length cable is discretized into some nodes for computing the cable <b>inertias.</b> Secondly, the dynamic equation integrated with the cable <b>inertias</b> is set up regarding the large-span cables as catenaries. Thirdly, an iterative optimization algorithm is introduced for the cable tension distribution by using the dynamic equation and sag-to-span ratios as constraint conditions. Finally, numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effects of cable sags and <b>inertias</b> on determining tensions. The results justify the convergence and effectiveness of the algorithm. In addition, the results show {{that it is necessary to}} take the cable sags and <b>inertias</b> into consideration for the large-span manipulators...|$|R

5|$|For {{a sample}} {{motorcycle}} moving at 22m/s (50mph) {{that has a}} front wheel with a moment of <b>inertia</b> of 0.6kg·m2, turning the front wheel one degree in half a second generates a roll moment of 3.5N·m. In comparison, the lateral force on the front tire as it tracks {{out from under the}} motorcycle reaches a maximum of 50N. This, acting on the 0.6m (2ft) height of the center of mass, generates a roll moment of 30N·m.|$|E
5|$|Ida's {{rotation}} period is 4.63 hours, {{making it one}} of the fastest rotating asteroids yet discovered. The calculated maximum moment of <b>inertia</b> of a uniformly dense object the same shape as Ida coincides with the spin axis of the asteroid. This suggests that there are no major variations of density within the asteroid. Ida's axis of rotation precesses with a period of 77 thousand years, due to the gravity of the Sun acting upon the nonspherical shape of the asteroid.|$|E

Preliminary {{analysis of the data}} covering Amazonis Planitia show that local features have anomalous thermal <b>inertias</b> but the ignimbrites as a whole do not consistently have significantly different thermal <b>inertias</b> from their surroundings. Preliminary photogeologic and IRTM studies of the large and small highland paterae have also begun. The purpose of IRTM studies of postulated Martian explosive volcanic deposits is to determine the physical properties of the proposed ignimbrites.

5|$|If {{the bike}} and rider are {{considered}} to be a single system, the forces that act on that system and its components can be roughly divided into two groups: internal and external.

The cause of the difficulty is rotational <b>inertia,</b> since much of Tyrannosaurus’ mass was some distance from its center of gravity, like a human carrying a heavy timber.|$|E

5|$|The {{affair with}} Sejanus {{and the final}} years of treason trials {{permanently}} damaged Tiberius' image and reputation.

The spontaneous fission lifetimes are evaluated employing different schemes for the collective <b>inertias</b> and vibrational energy corrections. This allows to explore the sensitivity of the lifetimes to those quantities together with the collective ground state energy along the superheavy landscape. We computed neutron induced stellar reaction rates relevant for r-process nucleosynthesis using the statistical approach and study the impact of collective <b>inertias.</b> The competition between different reaction channels including neutron induced rates, spontaneous fission and alpha decay is discussed for typical r-process conditions.

5|$|Dynamic {{balance is}} {{provided}} through the three semicircular canals. These three canals are orthogonal (at right angles) to each other. At {{the end of}} each canal is a slight enlargement, known as the ampulla, which contains numerous cells with filaments in a central area called the cupula. The fluid in these canals rotates according to the momentum of the head. When a person changes acceleration, the <b>inertia</b> of the fluid changes. This affects the pressure on the cupula, and results in the opening of ion channels. This causes depolarisation, which is passed as a signal to the brain along the vestibulocochlear nerve. Dynamic balance also helps maintain eye tracking when moving, via the vestibulo–ocular reflex.|$|E
