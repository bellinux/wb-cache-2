The purpose of this dissertation was to examine the connections between supportive parenting, self-esteem, and obesity over time. This dissertation includes two related studies that both utilize a Family Systems Theory to guide the research. Utilizing the Family Transitions Project (FTP), a longitudinal study that examines adolescents and their families over 23 years, this study extends the current literature by examining how maternal supportive parenting during early <b>adolescence</b> influences obesity <b>in</b> late <b>adolescence</b> and ultimately how both of these influence the individual 2 ̆ 7 s parent-child relationships with their own children in adulthood. This study also considers the possible effects of self-esteem on the aforementioned relationships.

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} whether executive functioning (EF) <b>in</b> early <b>adolescence</b> predicted alcohol use disorder (AUD) <b>in</b> late <b>adolescence</b> and whether adolescents with AUD differed in maturation of EF from controls without a diagnosis. Methods: We used the data from the Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS), a cohort of 2230 Dutch adolescents. Working memory, inhibition, and attention were measured at ages 11 and 19. At age 19, lifetime DSM-IV diagnoses were determined, resulting in a control group (n = 1111) and two AUD groups, i. e., alcohol abusers (n = 381) and alcohol dependents (n = 51). Regression analyses assessed whether EF at age 11 predicted the transition to AUD <b>in</b> late <b>adolescence</b> and whether AUD affected maturation of EF from age 11 to 19. Results: EF <b>in</b> early <b>adolescence</b> did not predict AUD <b>in</b> late <b>adolescence.</b> A significant interaction effect emerged between gender and alcohol dependence for shift attention (beta =. 0. 12, SE= 0. 36), with girls showing smaller maturational rates. This effect remained significant after controlling for alcohol intake (ages 16 and 19) and comorbid psychiatric disorders. Discussion: Our results do not replicate the finding that EF <b>in</b> early <b>adolescence</b> is a significant predictor of AUD <b>in</b> late <b>adolescence.</b> Furthermore, for the majority of tasks, adolescents with AUD do not differ in EF maturation over the course of adolescence. Alcohol dependent girls however, show less maturation of shift attention. This is independent of the quantity of alcohol intake, which could suggest that non normative maturation of EF is associated with the behavioural components of AUD. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract — Aims: We tested {{whether an}} {{exposure}} to alcohol <b>in</b> late <b>adolescence,</b> {{an age of}} rapid increase in neuroactive steroid precursors, would increase voluntary alcohol consumption in adult rats and whether this effect would be modulated by finasteride, an inhibitor of neuroactive steroid synthesis. Methods: In Experiment 1, we exposed male Wistar rats to 8 % alcohol during the dark cycle for 1 week during late adolescence [postnatal days (PNDs) 51 – 58], and then measured voluntary alcohol consumption 1 month later in adulthood (PNDs 91 – 104). In Experiment 2, finasteride was administered during the forced alcohol exposure <b>in</b> late <b>adolescence</b> and, <b>in</b> Experiment 3, during voluntary alcohol consumption in adulthood. Plasma was collected {{at the end of}} each finasteride treatment to confirm the reduction of plasma neuroactive steroid levels. Results: We found that a daily 12 -h exposure to alcohol for 7 days <b>in</b> late <b>adolescence</b> significantly increased voluntary alcohol consumption (4 -fold) a month later during adulthood. Finasteride administration <b>in</b> late <b>adolescence</b> increased group alcohol intake <b>in</b> late <b>adolescence</b> but did not block the effect of ado-lescent alcohol exposure on increasing alcohol preference in adulthood. There was no effect of finasteride treatment in adulthood on alcohol preference. Conclusions: A daily 12 -h exposure to alcohol for 7 days <b>in</b> late <b>adolescence</b> was sufficient to induce chronically increased alcohol preference in adulthood, indicating that this age may be sensitive to the effects of alcohol...|$|R
40|$|Extant {{research}} suggests that negative family processes during adolescence may be detrimental to health over time. Informed by family systems theory and the biopsychosocial perspective, {{this study examined the}} association of negative family processes <b>in</b> early <b>adolescence</b> and health status and body mass index <b>in</b> late <b>adolescence</b> and early adulthood. Data from U. S. males and females in two-parent households from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 were examined over a ten year period from early adolescence to early adulthood. Results from logistic regressions and multiple regressions suggest that negative parent-child processes (NPCP) and negative inter-parental processes (NIPP) are associated with elevated risk for poorer health status but are not associated with body mass index. Logistic regressions estimated the association between NPCP and NIPP and youth's risk of very good, good and poor health status, respectively, as compared to excellent health status. Specifically, there is a step function for the association between NPCP and risk for poorer health status <b>in</b> late <b>adolescence</b> and early adulthood, between NIPP and risk for poorer health status <b>in</b> late <b>adolescence</b> and between NIPP and risk for the poorest health status category in early adulthood. Mental health, unhealthy behaviors (tobacco use, marijuana use and alcohol use), and healthy behaviors (i. e. physical activity) partially mediated the association between NPCP and NIPP, respectively, and health status <b>in</b> late <b>adolescence,</b> and mental health and tobacco use (only for NPCP) partially mediated the association with health status in early adulthood. All analyses are independent of race, gender, maternal education, health status <b>in</b> early <b>adolescence,</b> BMI <b>in</b> early <b>adolescence,</b> parental health status, and parental BMI.
