A {{collection}} of the strips was published by Northwest Press in 2011, followed {{by a series of}} new material beginning in 2014. The strip is about an anthropomorphic rabbit named Rick (a stand-in for the creator) and his friends and associates, which include Truckstop (a sexually adventurous fox), Prester (an alcoholic teddy bear), Rickets (an amnesiac robot), and Capitalist Pig (a piggy bank). The series also depicts realistic human characters, including Rick's boyfriends, and fictionalized versions of cartoonists Bill Watterson and Jim Davis.|$|R

A polyglot, Raiba, learned Urdu as a child at school, soon composing couplets, and then translating the poetry of Allama Iqbal into English. He graduated from Sir JJ School of art in 1946, and was active alongside the Progressive Artists Group, especially friendly with Hussain and Ara, working at jobs they found between them - at the storied furniture shop and cinema studios that are a part of the art history of this period. He left for Kashmir on the suggestion of Walter Langhammer, the Times of India art director, returning to Bombay after five years.|$|R
40|$|Electronics is an {{important}} industry in the UK, as there are many home-grown manufacturing companies {{in the areas of}} optics, electronics and micro-systems. As a consequence of the growth in this industry, there has been an increase in the discharges from manufacturing. A process that could reclaim the metals contained in these wastes is desirable because of the increasing costs of raw materials and environmental compliance. The aim of this project was to develop a systematic method to determine the feasibility of metal recovery from aqueous solutions. <b>Waste</b> tin <b>stripping</b> solution was chosen as a case study. This waste arises from a stage in the manufacture of printed circuit boards when a protective tin layer is stripped from the copper pattern. The solution is mainly nitric acid, but also contains suspension agents, ferric salts and inhibitors. After use it also contains suspended tin oxide and dissolved copper. It has been suggested that the tin and copper could be recovered from this waste by electrodeposition. Initially the thermodynamics of the system were studied, followed by experiments to verify the theoretical work. Pourbaix diagrams were constructed to determine when the metals would be in the solid or liquid phase depending on the concentration of metal and anion, pH and system potential. This information was then compared to separation processes to determine or confirm the recovery route. This study showed that the dissolved copper and suspended tin oxide could be separated by filtration if the pH was maintained between - 0. 4 and 2. 4. The dissolved copper could then be removed by electrodeposition. After the metal recovery route has been established, the individual stages are studied in more detail. In this project the feasibility of copper recovery from the <b>stripping</b> <b>waste</b> was examined. Copper deposition occurs concurrently with nitrate, ferric and hydrogen reductions. Using a parallel plate electrochemical reactor, the copper concentration was reduced by approximately 30 %, at a current efficiency of 70 %.

40|$|We have {{developed}} two significant modifications to conventional airstripping of MTBE from contaminated groundwater. The first modification involves application of thermodynamic principles to improve {{by at least}} a factor of three the overall mass transfer efficiency, obtaining very high removal efficiencies, {{using a combination of}} higher operating temperatures (40 - 60 o C) and vacuum pressures (from 0. 3 to 0. 6 atm) in the system. Higher temperatures and lower operating pressures increase the stripping factor by increasing both Henry's constant and the mass transfer coefficient. These process improvements allow the removal of much less volatile compounds like polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB), or more soluble compounds like methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) from contaminated water, increasing the operational range of the <b>stripping</b> unit. <b>Waste</b> heat from an internal combustion engine is used to increase water temperature. The engine supplies the vacuum and uses the gas-phase pollutants as supplementary fuel...|$|R
40|$|Large {{quantities}} of industrial wastes are being generated worldwide due to rapid urbanization and industrialization. The {{disposal of wastes}} in landfills or open areas is not an environment friendly solution. Utilization of the industrial wastes in geotechnical applications is likely to provide an acceptable solution. Keeping this in view, an experimental study was carried out to demonstrate the potential application of three industrial wastes, namely fly ash, stone dust, and waste recycled product (WRP) generated after recycling of blast furnace slag from steel plant, in pavements after reinforcing them randomly with high density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic <b>waste</b> <b>strips.</b> Three different sizes of <b>waste</b> plastic <b>strips</b> were used in this study. The effects of strip content (0 · 25 - 4 % by weight) and aspect ratio (strip length to width ratio) on the California bearing ratio (CBR), peak piston load ratio (PPLR) at 12 · 5 mm penetration, and subgrade modulus of plastic strip-reinforced specimens were investigated. The study has revealed that the addition of <b>waste</b> plastic <b>strips</b> to industrial <b>wastes</b> results in an appreciable increase in CBR and subgrade modulus (ks). Based on the CBR value, the layer thickness reduction (LTR) of reinforced specimens were also determined. It {{was found that the}} proposed reinforced waste materials can be used in flexible pavement construction leading to safe and economical disposal of the wastes...|$|R

The light {{laughter}} and frivolous adieux of the departing guests seemed to have melted away into a world somewhere beyond the pale of the unseasonable fog. The little <b>strip</b> of <b>waste</b> ground adjoining was wrapped in gloom and silence. The exterior of the bare and deserted chapel, long since unconsecrate, was dull and lifeless. Inside, however, began the march of strange things. First of all, the pinprick of light of a tiny electric torch seemed {{as though it had}} risen from the floor, and Hassan, pushing back a trap-door, stepped into the bare, dusty conventicle.

Afterwards he passed between the row of dilapidated benches and paused at the entrance door. He stooped down, examined the keyless lock, shook it gently, gazed upwards and downwards as though in vain search of bolts that were never there. His white teeth gleamed for a moment in the darkness.

40|$|The {{production}} of integrated circuits involves {{a number of}} discrete steps that utilize hazardous or regulated solvents. Environmental, safety and health considerations associated with these chemicals have prompted a search for alternative, more environmentally benign, solvent systems. An emerging technology for conventional solvent replacement {{is the use of}} supercritical fluids based on carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2 }). Supercritical CO{sub 2 } (SCCO{sub 2 }) is an excellent choice for IC manufacturing processes since it is non-toxic, non-flammable, inexpensive, and is compatible with all substrate and metallizations systems. Also, conditions of temperature and pressure needed to achieve the supercritical state are easily achievable with existing process equipment. The authors first describe the general properties of supercritical fluids, with particular emphasis on their application as alternative solvents. Next, they review some of the work which has been published involving the use of supercritical fluids, and particularly CO{sub 2 }, as they may be applied to the various steps of IC manufacture, including wafer cleaning, thin film deposition, etching, photoresist <b>stripping,</b> and <b>waste</b> treatment. Next, they describe the research work conducted at Los Alamos, on behalf of Hewlett-Packard, on the use of SCCO{sub 2 } in a specific step of the IC manufacturing process: the stripping of hard-baked photoresist...|$|R
40|$|In open-cut <b>strip</b> mining, <b>waste</b> {{material}} is placed in-pit to minimise operational mine costs. Slope failures in these spoil piles pose a significant safety risk to personnel, {{along with a}} financial risk from loss of equipment and scheduling delays. It has been observed that most spoil pile failures occur when the pit has been previously filled with water and then subsequently dewatered. The failures are often initiated {{at the base of}} spoil piles where the material can undergo significant slaking (disintegration) over time due to overburden pressure and water saturation. It is important to understand how the mechanical properties of base spoil material are affected by slaking when designing safe spoil pile slope angles, heights, and dewatering rates. In this study, fresh spoil material collected from a coal mine in Brown Basin Coalfield of Queensland, Australia was subjected to high overburden pressure (0 – 900 kPa) under saturated condition and maintained {{over a period of time}} (0 – 6 months) allowing the material to slake. To create the above conditions, laboratory designed pressure chambers were used. Once a spoil sample was slaked under certain overburden pressure over a period of time, it was tested for classification, permeability, and strength properties. Results of this testing program suggested that the slaking of saturated coal mine spoil increase with overburden pressure and the time duration over which the overburden pressure was maintained. Further, it was observed that shear strength and permeability of spoil decreased with increase in spoil slaking...|$|R
5000|$|Confusingly, the printmaking {{technique}} used in steel engravings is, after the earliest {{years in the}} 1820s, normally a combination of etching and true engraving, with etching becoming dominant in later examples, after the technique became popular in the 1830s. Engraving is done with a burin, which is a small bar of hardened steel with a sharp point. It is pushed along the plate to produce thin furrowed lines, leaving [...] "burr" [...] or <b>strips</b> of <b>waste</b> metal to the side. This {{is followed by the}} use of a scraper to remove any burs, since they would be an impediment during the subsequent inking process. Steel plates are very hard for this technique, which is normally used on softer copper plates. So steel engraving also used etching (q.v.), where acid creates the lines in the plates in the pattern made by selectively removing a thin coating of acid-resistant ground by tools. This is much less effort. As well as etching needles, the etched part of steel engravings made great use of roulettes, small wheels mounted in handles which have regular sharp projections which produce broken lines of dots and dashes when rolled across the plate. Roulettes of different types were used together with the burin and needle to create densely packed marks which appear as tonal to the eye, and allow a great variety of textures and effects. True burin engraving was generally used to finish the etched image.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} four years Potgietersrust Platinums (PPRust) has {{successfully}} implemented new geotechnical strategy and tactics to reduce risk, improving safety but also maximising profitability. A large database of core logging, face mapping and rock testing has been assembled and used in the slope design process. The data has also been used for optimising blast designs on a daily basis {{through the use of a}} geotechnical block model. This greatly improves blast fragmentation and therefore loading and milling efficiencies. Slope management includes a limit blasting programme, daily visual inspections, and state-of-the-art slope monitoring equipment, namely GroundProbe radar, Riegl lasers and GeoMoS automated prism monitoring. Slope optimisation incorporates all the field data, operational controls, cost of failure, full economic analysis of various slope angles and fault tree analysis. Savings on <b>waste</b> <b>stripping</b> of hundreds of millions of Rands were gained from the optimisation as slope angles could be increased due to improved geotechnical knowledge and management.

40|$|Cities in the {{developing}} countries have multiple modes of human and animal waste treatment and disposal that finally decide the overall impact on the urban ecosystem, and these have been studied {{for the city of}} Bangalore. Four modes are found, namely underground sewage systems, decentralized soak pits and septic tanks, open defecation and a miniscule effort at composting. The extent of N released per unit area is high, ranging between 0. 44 and 1. 4 t $ha^{- 1 }$ of the urban landscape. In this study the N release and outflow have been estimated. The N entering or flowing in the lithosphere,hydrosphere and in wastewater streams forms the major component. The pool size has first been determined. The size and movement through these pools were estimated with a view to determine the state of the N cycle {{and if there is a}} cause for alarm in similar cities in other developing countries. N contribution from human waste (excreta and urine) forms the singlelargest influx and sewage flowing out of the city forms the single largest efflux of N pool. Owing to a seemingly large use of soak pits and open conveyance of sewage in some parts of the city, coliforms and $NO_ 3 $–N have seeped into shallow and deep-ground aquifers and show up in ground- and sub-soil waters in the city. The level of N in these waters at a few places is slightly higher than the permissible limits. This suggests that there is a need to find alternatives to modes like the ubiquitous soak pit, such that pollution of shallow and deep aquifers is avoided in the future. Currently,there is little effort in <b>stripping</b> the <b>waste</b> water off N. Also, there is no significant effort in recovery and reuse of nutrients, and this is required to increase the sustainability levels...|$|R

The High Horseman asked a series of set questions of his fellows at which they responded with a series of set answers. Turning to the initiate, who I made to kneel and has his blindfold removed, the High Horseman then commanded the newcomer to provide vows to keep to the group's secrets.

40|$|With rapid {{urban and}} {{industrial}} developments, {{large quantities of}} wastes are being generated worldwide. The disposal of these wastes in landfills is not a sustainable solution for countries like India due to availability of limited land space. Waste management and waste reduction can be achieved through recycling or re-use. Utilization of industrial wastes in geotechnical applications is likely to provide viable, environmentally friendly, and sustainable solutions. In view of these requirements, an experimental study was carried out to demonstrate the potential of using two industrial wastes, namely fly ash and waste recycled product (WRP) generated after recycling of blast furnace slag from steel plant, reinforced separately with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic <b>waste</b> <b>strips.</b> Three different sizes of <b>waste</b> plastic <b>strips</b> were used in this study.

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Waste</b> <b>stripping</b> {{involves}} the most costly processes {{for any given}} open cut coal mining operation, As such, it is fundamentally important to optimise material scheduling and the sequences involved in excavating and hauling waste material. In situations constrained by fleet capacity and productivity. The only viable option to potentially yield further cost gains is to modify current mining methods. In the case of many Australian coal mines, truck-shovel systems excavate the initial overlying waste, known as pre-strip, down to a predetermined level known as the pre-strip horizon. This paper provides and analyses a simulation model to derive the optimal strip width for pre-strip activities. Case study data obtained from an established leading coal producer in the Bowen Basin was implemented into a pit simulation model to assess the effect of pre-strip width on the overall pit economics. Pre-strip widths of 60 to 120 m in 10 m increments were assessed whilst keeping dragline and coal stripping widths constant at 60 m. The simulation revealed the potential for cost reductions to be significant when a 90 m pre-strip case is adopted {{as opposed to the}} base case of 60 m. The paper presents the simulation findings for each case and discusses the key drivers behind the cost variations for each case...|$|R

The Kosovo basin {{has so far been}} the main basin used for mining. Lignite exploitation in Kosovo was first recorded in 1922, in the Kosovo basin, when mining began. Kosovo Basin has a surface area of 274 km2. The Dukagjini basin has a surface area of 49 km2. Other basins encompass a surface area of 5.1 km2.The lignite in Kosovo is low in sulfur content and has a good lime concentration which means it can absorb sulfur during combustion.Overall, the lignite mines in Kosovo have among the most favorable characteristics in Europe.

The effect of the ISO 105 C 09 oxidative-bleach fading test on the azo and anthraquinone chromophoric species was established by both surface chemical and colorimetric analyses.

40|$|Calcine was {{generated}} at the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant over several {{decades as a}} method of solidifying numerous raffinates and wastes from spent nuclear fuel reprocessing for convenient interim storage. Unfortunately, the bulk of the calcine is inert, with radionuclides comprising less than 1 weight percent of the total calcine mass. The bulk of the calcine currently stored at the ICPP was produced from wastes generated during reprocessing of zirconium clad fuels. Consequently, this material contains varying, but large quantities of zirconium oxide. Currently, separations options are being considered for acidic solutions of dissolved ICPP calcines to minimize high level waste volumes and economic penalties perceived for final disposal of these wastes. The actinide separation process being emphasized for the dissolved calcine solutions is the TRUEX process.

40|$|During Modular Caustic-Side Solvent Extraction (CSSX) Unit (MCU) operations, Cs- 137 {{concentrations}} in product streams will {{vary depending on}} the location in the process and on the recent process conditions. Calculations of cesium concentrations under a variety of operating conditions reveal the following: (1) Under nominal operations with salt solution feed containing 1. 1 Ci Cs- 137 per gallon, the maximum Cs- 137 concentration in the process will occur in the strip effluent (SE) and equal 15 - 16. 5 Ci/gal. (2) Under these conditions, the majority of the solvent will contain 0. 005 to 0. 01 Ci/gal, with a limited portion of the solvent in the contactor stages containing {approx} 4 Ci/gal. (3) When operating conditions yield product near 0. 1 Ci Cs- 137 /gal in the decontaminated salt solution (DSS), the SE cesium concentration will be the same or lower than in nominal operations, but majority of the stripped solvent will increase to {approx} 2 - 3 Ci/gal. (4) Deviations in <b>strip</b> and <b>waste</b> stream flow rates cause the largest variations in cesium content: (a) If strip flow rates deviate by - 30 % of nominal, the SE will contain {approx} 23 Ci/gal, although the cesium content of the solvent will increase to only 0. 03 Ci/gal; (b) If strip flow rate deviates by - 77 % (i. e., 23 % of nominal), the SE will contain 54 Ci/gal and solvent will contain 1. 65 Ci/gal. At this point, the product DSS will just reach the limit of 0. 1 Ci/gal, causing the DSS gamma monitors to alarm; and (c) Moderate (+ 10 to + 30 %) deviations in waste flow rate cause approximately proportional increases in the SE and solvent cesium concentrations. Recovery from a process failure due to poor cesium stripping can achieve any low cesium concentration required. Passing the solvent back through the contactors while recycling DSS product will produce a {approx} 70 % reduction during one pass through the contactors (assuming the stripping D value is no worse than 0. 36). If the solvent is returned to the solvent hold tank (containing additional, unstripped solvent), 3. 3 tank turnovers will reduce the cesium content by an order of magnitude.

The flowsheet consisted of ten stages of extraction, two stages of scrub, six stages of strip, and six stages of solvent wash. With this testing, removal efficiencies of 99. 4 %, 99. 995 %, and 99. 96 % were obtained for 137 Cs, 90 Sr, and total alpha, respectively. This is sufficient to reduce the activities of 137 Cs, 90 Sr, and the actinides in a grout waste form to below NRC Class A LLW requirements. Significant amounts of the Ba (99 %), Pb (98. 6 %), Zr (84 %), Mo (32 %), K (28 %), and Fe (8 %), were also removed from the feed with the universal solvent extraction flowsheet. Approximately 0. 1 % of the Na and Al were extracted and exited with the high-activity <b>waste</b> <b>strip</b> product. Operational problems such as flooding or precipitate formation were not observed during testing...|$|R
40|$|When slope angles are {{designed}} during open pit optimisation, {{there is a}} risk factor applied to steepen the slopes. The steepening of slope angles has implications on the safety and economics of the mining operation. The steeper the slope angles, the greater the probability of slope failure and also the higher the benefit of cost saving during <b>waste</b> <b>stripping.</b> The challenge facing the mining engineers involved in open pit design is to maximize the economic benefits of the project without putting the mine workers and the mining equipment at the risk of rock falls. This challenge is addressed by striking a balance between safety of the operation and the cost savings. The ideal situation is to have a slope monitoring system that will predict slope failure by detecting any ground movement before the actual failure occurs. This will allow for the application of the risk factor {{with a high degree of}} confidence knowing that the risk will be adequately mitigated with a slope monitoring system. The objective of this research report is to provide guidelines on how to design an optimal survey slope monitoring system. It is the author’s view that for a survey monitoring system to yield desirable results, it should adhere to survey principles such as working from the whole to part and cross checking always. The research report covers all aspects of the survey monitoring systems such as survey control network design, beacon construction, equipment selection, data management, procedures and personnel involved in slope monitoring. The report was compiled with guidance from published papers by various authors and discussions with mine surveyors and geotechnical engineers involved in slope stability monitoring. The findings used for analysis are from Jwaneng Mine. The design strategy outlined in this report can be used as a guideline for setting up a new slope monitoring system or to optimise an existing monitoring setup...|$|R
40|$|TRUEX {{is being}} {{evaluated}} at Idaho Chemical Processing Plant (ICPP) for separating actinides from acidic radioactive waste stored at ICPP; efforts have {{culminated in a}} recent demonstration with actual tank waste. A continuous countercurrent flowsheet test was successfully completed at ICPP using waste from tank WM- 183. This demonstration was performed using 24 states of 2 -cm dia centrifugal contactors in the shielded hot cell at the ICPP Remote Analytical Laboratory. The flowsheet had 8 extraction stages, 5 scrub stages, 6 strip stages, 3 solvent wash stages, and 2 acid rinse stages. A centrifugal contactor stage in the scrub section was not working during testing, and the scrub feed (aqueous) solution followed the solvent into the strip section, eliminating the scrub section in the flowsheet. An overall removal efficiency of 99. 97 % was obtained for the actinides, reducing the activity from 457 nCi/g in the feed to 0. 12 nCi/g in the aqueous raffinate, well below the NRC Class A LLW requirement of 10 nCi/g for non-TRU waste. The 0. 04 M HEDPA strip section back-extracted 99. 9998 % of the actinide from the TRUEX solvent. Removal efficiencies of > 99. 90, 99. 96, 99. 98, > 98. 89, 93. 3, and 89 % were obtained for {sup 241 }Am, {sup 238 }Pu, {sup 239 }Pu, {sup 235 }U, {sup 238 }U, and {sup 99 }Tc. Fe was partially extracted by the TRUEX solvent, resulting in 23 % of the Fe exiting in the strip product. Hg was also extracted by the TRUEX solvent (73 %) and stripped from the solvent in the 0. 25 M Na 2 CO 3 wash section. Only 1. 4 % of the Hg exited with the high activity <b>waste</b> <b>strip</b> product...|$|R
40|$|Diabetes, {{a disease}} {{in which the}} body does not produce or {{properly}} use insulin, can lead to serious damage {{to many of the}} body's systems, including the nerves, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and heart. It is also a leading cause of death in the United States; 7 th most common cause in 2006 (CDC). It has been shown through two NIH studies* over 22 years that tight control of blood glucose levels, requiring multiple glucose tests each day, significantly reduces the risk of eye disease (76 %), kidney disease (50 %), nerve disease (60 %) and heart attack and stroke (57 %). Current monitoring technology (glucometers) require drawing blood for each glucose level measurement, which is painful, expensive (up to $ 800 /year for supplies to complete recommended 4 - 5 measurements per day), and inconvenient (each test requires a new alcohol swab, lancet and test strip). As a result, most diabetics do not test as often as recommended by their doctors. Researchers at UM-St. Louis have developed technology for a non-invasive blood glucose detector. The new portable optical device will allow for pain-free, inexpensive detection of glucose levels in capillaries of the finger with no <b>waste</b> (<b>strips,</b> lancets, etc.). Unlike other non-invasive monitors in development, this technology provides for detection in ~ 1 second based on a pulsatile approach, eliminating the potential problems of finger movement, temperature change, light power drift, and optical interference from finger components such as fat, muscle, bone, skin, nail and interstitial fluid.

40|$|Venetia Mine is {{situated}} {{south of the}} confluence of the Shashi and Limpopo rivers, 80 km West of Musina and 36 km North-east of Alldays in South Africa. Venetia is an open pit, truck and shovel operation which commenced full production in 1993. Mining began on the Cut 4 design in 2006 with a final planned open pit depth of approximately 500 m below surface at a maximum <b>waste</b> <b>stripping</b> rate of approximately 50 million tonnes per annum. The country rock assemblages at Venetia are part of the Limpopo Mobile Belt and mainly consist of metamorphic and intrusive igneous rocks. The stability of the pit is structurally controlled and the structure can be divided into two main components, ductile structure (foliation) and brittle structures (major structures and joints). A dominant metamorphic foliation cross cuts all the geology which results in an anisotropic rock mass strength. The interaction between the brittle jointing and foliation also locally impacts on bench stability and subsequent bench performance. The slope design is therefore highly dependent on the orientation of the pit slopes relative to structural features. Up to 2009 Venetia mine employed high energy blasting techniques, mainly focused on achieving high production rates and optimum fragmentation, to develop the final walls of the pit. Excavating the highwalls with conventional production blasting techniques resulted in extremely poor highwall conditions. In 2009 this practice was ceased and the mine started experimenting with limit blasting techniques on the final pit limits. The benefit of the limit blasting was however not quantified. That same year a revision and optimisation of the business plan was undertaken of which one aspect was the review of the slope angles and design sectors. The acceptance criteria, as recommended by the Guidelines for Open Pit Slope Design (Read and Stacey, 2009) were used by De Beers to determine the acceptable level of risk for the optimisation programme. Rigorous reviews of actual pit slope performance were conducted for the North and Southern slopes. This indicated that the bench performance in the Southern slopes can be isolated to distinct areas. The South-western portion of the slope had the highest incidence of complete bench failures (43...|$|R
