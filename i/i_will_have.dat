25|$|When I {{raise my}} hand to take the oath on Swearing In Day, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> the Bible in my other hand. I do not {{subscribe}} to using the Koran in any way. The Muslim Representative from Minnesota was elected by the voters of that district and if American citizens don't wake up and adopt the Virgil Goode position on immigration there will likely be many more Muslims elected to office and demanding {{the use of the}} Koran.|$|E

25|$|When {{the angels}} heard Lilith's words, they insisted she go back. But she swore {{to them by}} the name of the living and eternal God: 'Whenever I see you or your names or your forms in an amulet, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> no power over that infant.' She also agreed to have one hundred of her {{children}} die every day. Accordingly, every day one hundred demons perish, and for the same reason, we write the angels' names on the amulets of young children. When Lilith sees their names, she remembers her oath, and the child recovers.|$|E
25|$|These tenses (except for present perfect) {{correspond}} roughly to equivalent English perfect tenses (I {{had read}} / <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> read). They {{are used in}} various contexts for very different meanings, but they usually indicate an action that happened before another action said with another verb, noun or similar: Tos knygos neėmiau, nes jau ją buvau skaitęs – I didn’t take that book because I had already read it; Po kelionės vaikai bus labai pasiilgę tėvų – After the trip the children will have badly missed their parents.|$|E
500|$|Kinsler, {{who would}} have been {{eligible}} to play for Israel in the 2013 World Baseball Classic because of his Jewish heritage, said: [...] "Wow, I would be happy to play for Team Israel.... The truth is that if a proposal comes from Team USA to play for them, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> a very difficult decision to make. Youk , Braun , and I could make a fantastic team. I am sure that I'll talk it over with Youk – we always laugh about things like this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some other course must be found," [...] {{cried the}} King, rousing himself. [...] "It must be found, do you hear? <b>I</b> <b>will</b> not <b>have</b> you touch {{the life of}} my friend the Admiral. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> not <b>have</b> it--by the Blood!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{had lots}} of things like Fan, <b>I</b> <b>'d</b> <b>have</b> an auction and get all I could for them. Why don't you?" [...] asked Maud, {{beginning}} on her third bonnet.|$|R

500|$|Timberlake was outspoken {{during his}} time in the limelight about the {{importance}} of his Christian faith. [...] Timberlake taught Sunday school in Ann Arbor while attending the University of Michigan and said he intended to become a Presbyterian minister. [...] At a speech in Mansfield, Ohio, shortly after winning the Rose Bowl in January 1965, Timberlake said, [...] "I couldn't have played football if it hadn't been for Jesus Christ." [...] He continued, [...] "God changed my life. [...] He promises the abundant life, which he has given me, and eternal life, which if I die I'm sure <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have.</b> [...] There's peace associated with being a Christian." ...|$|E
500|$|In a Playboy {{interview}} with David Sheff {{shortly before his}} death, Lennon said, [...] "Sean was a planned child, {{and therein lies the}} difference. I don't love Julian any less as a child. He's still my son, whether he came from a bottle of whiskey or because they didn't have pills in those days. He's here, he belongs to me, and he always will." [...] He said he was trying to re-establish a connection with the then 17-year-old, and confidently predicted, [...] "Julian and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> a relationship in the future." [...] After his death it was revealed that he had left Julian very little in his will.|$|E
500|$|According to its chairman, by 2014, {{the club}} would be further renamed [...] "Hull Tigers," [...] because, as he claimed, [...] "in marketing, the shorter the name the more {{powerful}} ," [...] while [...] "Association Football Club" [...] made the name too long. Allam stated he dislikes the word [...] "City", as it is too [...] "common" [...] and a [...] "lousy identity", since it is associated also with other clubs, such as Leicester City, Bristol City and Manchester City. He told David Conn of The Guardian that [...] "in a few years many clubs will follow and change their names to something more interesting and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> proved I am a leader," [...] adding {{that if he were}} the owner of Manchester City, he would change their name to [...] "Manchester Hunter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That 's my wig, sir!" [...] said Johnny Sprigg, [...] "and {{you shall}} pay for it, or <b>I</b> <b>'ll</b> <b>have</b> {{the law on}} you. Are you the man who shot the duck here {{yesterday}} morning?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{have you}} come, Edith? But I need not ask, <b>I</b> know. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> not <b>have</b> it, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> not <b>have</b> it! <b>I</b> {{have told you}} so before. Why is our {{happiness}} to be sacrificed? I have given my work and my life to England, but <b>I</b> <b>will</b> not give my happiness too, nor <b>will</b> <b>I</b> sacrifice yours." ...|$|R
25|$|Henceforth <b>I</b> <b>will</b> not <b>have</b> {{to do with}} pity.|$|R
500|$|Editing and {{post-production}} work took roughly {{seven months}} to complete. Colby Parker Jr. served as editor, having previously worked with Berg on editing Battleship. Parker {{spent six months}} editing the film at the Lantana Entertainment Media Campus in Santa Monica, California. The editorial department used four Avid Media Composer systems to edit the film. Parker edited the film during principal photography, but was not on location. [...] "I like to blast through the footage {{to keep up with}} the camera. This way I can let [...] know if any extra coverage is needed", he explained. [...] "Often I’ll get word to the 1st [...] and he’ll sneak in extra shots if the schedule permits. Although <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> a first assembly when the production wraps, Peter will never sit though a complete viewing of that. He works in a very linear manner, so as we start to view a scene, if there's something that bothers him, we’ll stop and address it." ...|$|E
500|$|At the Sunday Times, Murdoch moved Giles {{to the new}} {{position}} of [...] "editor emeritus". When Giles asked what the title meant, Murdoch informed him that [...] "It's Latin, Frank; the e means you're out and the meritus means you deserved it." [...] Murdoch later said that [...] "circulation went up and it stayed up. We didn't lose money or anything like that", referring to the 20,000 new readers the paper retained after the scandal broke, {{and the fact that}} Stern returned all the money paid to it by the Sunday Times. In April 2012, during the Leveson Inquiry, he acknowledged his role in publishing the diaries, and took the blame for making the decision, saying [...] "It was a massive mistake I made and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> to live with {{it for the rest of}} my life." [...] Trevor-Roper died in 2003. Despite a long and respected career as a historian, according to Richard Davenport-Hines, his biographer, Trevor-Roper's role in the scandal left his reputation [...] "permanently besmirched". In January 1984 Broyles resigned as editor of Newsweek, to [...] "pursue new entrepreneurial ventures".|$|E
500|$|Euler's {{eyesight}} worsened {{throughout his}} mathematical career. In 1738, {{three years after}} nearly expiring from fever, he became almost blind in his right eye, but Euler rather blamed the painstaking work on cartography he performed for the St. Petersburg Academy for his condition. Euler's vision in that eye worsened throughout his stay in Germany, {{to the extent that}} Frederick referred to him as [...] "Cyclops". Euler later developed a cataract in his left eye, which was discovered in 1766. Just a few weeks after its discovery, he was rendered almost totally blind. However, his condition appeared to have little effect on his productivity, as he compensated for it with his mental calculation skills and exceptional memory. Upon losing the sight in both eyes, Euler remarked, [...] "Now <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> fewer distractions". For example, Euler could repeat the Aeneid of Virgil from beginning to end without hesitation, and for every page in the edition he could indicate which line was the first and which the last. With the aid of his scribes, Euler's productivity on many areas of study actually increased. He produced, on average, one mathematical paper every week in the year 1775. The Eulers bore a double name, Euler-Schölpi, the latter of which derives from schelb and schief, signifying squint-eyed, cross-eyed, or crooked. This suggests that the Eulers may have had a susceptibility to eye problems.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes; <b>I</b> <b>'d</b> <b>have</b> {{a little}} sweetheart, dear, it 's so cunning," [...] {{answered}} Mrs. Shaw. And Maud announced {{soon after that}} she was engaged to [...] "Fweddy, 'cause Hawry slapped her" [...] when she proposed the match.|$|R
6000|$|... "How curious you are!" [...] said I. [...] "I am almost {{ashamed to}} tell you, but <b>I</b> <b>will.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been {{thinking}} about my old looks--such as they were." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{first single}} from {{the album was}} [...] "Gone to Stay", {{released}} on May 14, 2007. One of the songs on the album, <b>I</b> <b>Will,</b> <b>has</b> been written by Pink for Natalia. The album turned platinum after one day of sales.|$|R
500|$|The King had a mixed {{relationship}} with Lord Melbourne. Melbourne's government mooted more ideas to introduce greater democracy, {{such as the}} devolution of powers to the Legislative Council of Lower Canada, which greatly alarmed the King, who feared it would eventually lead {{to the loss of}} the colony. At first, the King bitterly opposed these proposals. William exclaimed to Lord Gosford, Governor General-designate of Canada: [...] "Mind what you are about in Canada... mind me, my Lord, the Cabinet is not my Cabinet; they had better take care or by God, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> them impeached." [...] When William's son Augustus FitzClarence enquired of his father whether the King would be entertaining during Ascot week, William gloomily replied, [...] "I cannot give any dinners without inviting the ministers, and I would rather see the devil than any one of them in my house." [...] Nevertheless, William approved the Cabinet's recommendations for reform. Despite his disagreements with Lord Melbourne, the King wrote warmly to congratulate the Prime Minister when he triumphed in the adultery case brought against him concerning Lady Caroline Norton—he had refused to permit Melbourne to resign when the case was first brought. The King and Prime Minister eventually found a modus vivendi; Melbourne applying tact and firmness when called for; while William realised that his First Minister was far less radical in his politics than the King had feared.|$|E
2500|$|Romans 9:15–16: [...] "For he saith to Moses, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> {{mercy on}} whom <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> mercy, and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> {{compassion}} on whom <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> compassion. So {{then it is}} not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Elrond and Círdan, Gil-galad's lieutenants, urged Isildur {{to destroy}} the Ring by casting it into Mount Doom, but he refused and kept it for his own: [...] "This <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> as weregild for my father's death, and my brother's. Was it not I that dealt the Enemy his death-blow?" ...|$|E
60|$|JACK. It {{was pure}} sport. I don't know how I got the thing. Of course <b>I</b> <b>'d</b> <b>had</b> {{a bit of}} a row--I did n't know what I was doing--I was--I Was--well, you know--I suppose I must have pulled the bag out of her hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "'I 'm {{afraid you}} 'll slip and get hurt.'" [...] 'Don't care if <b>I</b> do; <b>I</b> <b>'ll</b> <b>have</b> those plums if I break my neck doing it,' and half sliding, half walking I {{went down the}} sloping roof, till the boughs of the tree were within my reach.|$|R

2500|$|Any {{intention}} Ayodele Awojobi {{ever had}} of entering partisan politics, was {{revealed by the}} man himself when he spoke on national television, saying: [...] "At the age of 65, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> built the infrastructure. There would be very few illiterates in Nigeria when I mount the soapbox. Then, I will go into proper politics".|$|E
2500|$|In February 2006, Mbeki {{told the}} SABC {{that he and}} the ANC had no {{intention}} to change the Constitution of the country to permit him a third term in office. He stated, [...] "By the end of 2009, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> been in a senior position in government for 15 years. I think that's too long." ...|$|E
2500|$|During his {{campaign}} Peretz declared that [...] "within {{two years of}} taking office <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> eradicated child poverty in Israel". Notwithstanding, he has reiterated his commitment to a market economy. For his movement in latter years towards [...] "third way" [...] positions, {{as well as for}} his earthy and warm personality, Peretz has been compared to Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> not <b>have</b> his money--not {{more than}} enough to keep me from being a scandal to his family. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> not <b>have</b> it.

What right have I to all that money, because--because--because--" [...] She could not finish her sentence, but turned away from them, and walked by herself to the window.|$|R
6000|$|... "That 's all right, that 's all right," [...] the gang-leader interrupted. [...] "I 'd {{just as soon}} {{show you}} the way out as not. I ain't got nothin' 'gainst you. Come on an' follow me, an' don't step to the side, an' <b>I</b> <b>'ll</b> <b>have</b> you out in no time." ...|$|R
