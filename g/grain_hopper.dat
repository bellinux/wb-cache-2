50|$|A <b>grain</b> <b>hopper</b> trailer {{is used in}} {{conjunction}} with various other pieces of agricultural machinery to complete the harvest of a field. Combine harvesters or similar unload the harvest into grain carts, which in turn unload their load into a <b>grain</b> <b>hopper</b> trailer, for long distance transportation. The trailers are then unloaded into low-profile grain augers for transportation to, and long-term storage in, grain bins, also known as silo's.|$|E

50|$|With traffic growing Freight Victoria {{decided to}} replace the prime movers in number of the G class, {{increasing}} the power output to 3,800 hp. The older X class diesels also saw a more extensive power upgrade program, being stripped to the frame and rebuilt as the XR class. The company only purchased a single new locomotive, V544 which was built new in 2002 to replace two written off G class locomotives. Additional rollingstock was also acquired, including new 100 tonne capacity <b>grain</b> <b>hoppers</b> built by Alstom at the Ballarat North Workshops, second hand <b>grain</b> <b>hoppers</b> from FreightCorp, and the conversion of surplus vans into log and container flats.|$|R

50|$|<b>Grain</b> <b>hopper</b> {{trailers}} typically {{feature a}} rolling tarp {{on the top}} of the trailer, to enable easy loading of the product to be transported, and also offer protection during transport. They utilize two hoppers on the base of the trailer to unload to product, one servicing the rear half of the trailer, the other the front half. The output of these hoppers is usually controlled by a sliding plate on the base of the hopper, controlled by a user-operated crank handle.|$|E
50|$|Increase in {{wheel loads}} has {{important}} implications for the rail infrastructure needed to accommodate future <b>grain</b> <b>hopper</b> car shipments. The weight of the car is transmitted to the rails and the underlying track structure through these wheel loads. As wheel loads increase, track maintenance expenses increase and the ability of a given rail weight, ballast depth, and tie configuration to handle prolonged rail traffic decreases. Moreover, the ability of a given bridge to handle prolonged rail traffic also decreases as wheel loads increase.|$|E
50|$|In 1974, Bandeen {{returned}} to Montreal {{where he was}} appointed president of CN, replacing the retiring Norman J. MacMillan. As president, Bandeen moved to reorganize CN into distinct profit centres focused on the core freight rail business. Bandeen moved to sell non-core businesses such as CN Hotels and trucking subsidiaries. He also moved to organize operations requiring government subsidies into separate entities, including CN Marine, Via Rail, and Terra Transport. Under Bandeen's leadership, CN refused to build new freight cars for grain shipments in Western Canada, citing {{the economics of the}} Crow Rate. A subsequent government inquiry determined that the Crow Rate was in fact costing CN and CP millions and a new law was passed by the Parliament of Canada in 1983 that allowed grain transportation rates to increase while railway losses would be covered by a federal government subsidy; the federal government also committed to building a new fleet of <b>grain</b> <b>hopper</b> cars. Bandeen retired as President and Chief Executive Officer of CN in 1982.|$|E
5|$|The {{last four}} wheeled open wagons {{were built in}} 1958, but were not {{scrapped}} in large numbers until the 1980s when new bogie wagons replaced them.

Motor cars were loaded through doors in the ends of 'Asmo', 'Damo' and 'Mogo' vans (G24-G32, G43), also the bogie 'Bocar' (G33-G38, G44, G45).|$|R
50|$|Further {{conversions}} {{occurred in}} 2001-2003, when Freight Australia contracted ANI Bradken (Mittagong, NSW) to rebuild 22 of the VHEF class and 20 of the VHGF class {{to achieve a}} 100 LT capacity; the former were rebuilt into VHNY-class 100 LT grain wagons, becoming 1000-1021, while the latter kept their numbers (in the 230-296 range) but were reclassed to VHLY. The modifications were achieved by adding pneumatic roof hatches and discharge doors, strengthened side sills, a higher roof and stronger bogies. Around the same time, for comparison purposes, Alstom was contracted to new-build nine 100 LT <b>grain</b> <b>hoppers</b> at its Ballarat North Workshops; these became VHKY 1151-1159.|$|R

Realising that the Lady Hakai is the one responsible for her kidnapping, Leela challenges her to a duel, but the Lady is too rich and powerful to take her at all seriously, and indeed seems to regard her as a plaything.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} tested the hypothesis that initial key pecks in the autoshaping procedure are generalized pecks at the illuminated <b>grain</b> <b>hopper.</b> Experiment I found that autoshaping readily occurred when the chamber was continuously illuminated by a house-light. In Experiment II, pigeons given magazine training and autoshaping with an unlighted <b>grain</b> <b>hopper</b> failed to autoshape in 200 trials. Acquisition of autoshaped key pecking was retarded in Experiment III when stimulus control by the magazine light was reduced. In the fourth study, pigeons were given magazine training with either a red or white magazine light and then given autoshaping with concurrently presented red and white keys. For all pigeons in this experiment, the first key peck occurred on the key of {{the same color as}} that pigeon's magazine light. The results of these experiments were interpreted as supporting an account of autoshaping that identifies initial key pecks as arising due to generalization of pecking at the lighted <b>grain</b> <b>hopper</b> to pecking at the lighted key...|$|E

A response to the green key that was previously white was reinforced with three-second access to gain, a response to any other key resulted in a three-second blackout and {{the start of a new}} trial. Five of six subjects responded to the correct green key more often than chance at an interstimulus interval of 1. 5 seconds, and they displayed maximal performance at different intertrial interval values ranging from 15 to 60 seconds.

For both locations, foliar treatments were applied using a backpack sprayer and TeeJet (Springfield, IL) twinjet nozzles (TJ 11002) with 20 gpa at 40 lb psi. Soybean aphids were counted on randomly selected whole plants within each plot. To estimate the total exposure of soybean plants to soybean aphid, we calculated cumulative aphid days (CAD) {{based on the number of}} aphids per plant counted on each sampling date. Yields (bushels/acre) were determined by weighing grain with a <b>grain</b> <b>hopper</b> and corrected to 13 % moisture.

40|$|In Experiment I, keylight was {{paired with}} {{inaccessible}} grain delivery (under two conditions of keylight intensity) {{to determine if}} autoshaping would occur {{in the absence of}} primary reinforcement. In Experiment II, the procedure was repeated with accessible grain, for comparison. In Experiment III, the procedures were repeated with explicitly unpaired presentations of keylight and either inaccessible or accessible grain. The results indicated that key pecking occurred as quickly in the presence of keylight pairings with inaccessible grain as with accessible grain, though (except for one bird) key pecking was not maintained with inaccessible grain. Furthermore, compared to the dim keylight, the bright keylight greatly suppressed key pecking when paired with inaccessible grain, and reduced the rate of key pecking when paired with accessible grain. Little key pecking occurred in groups exposed to explicitly unpaired presentations of keylight (whether bright or dim) and grain (whether accessible or inaccessible). When the birds in Experiment III were retested with explicitly paired presentations of keylight and grain, little key pecking was observed, suggesting suppressive effects of prior explicitly unpaired presentations. It is suggested that the effects of key-brightness manipulation were produced by the association of grain with cues other than the response key, or by distraction produced by partial illumination of the <b>grain</b> <b>hopper...</b>|$|E

40|$|When {{darkness}} {{falls and}} {{the din of}} the workday recedes, there are sounds that characterize the night in La Crosse, Wisconsin. They are sounds that are familiar to me. After moving from a northeastern Wisconsin Ojibwe community, Mole Lake, my family rented a small one-story pink house on the city’s northside. Only blocks from the Burlington Northern and Soo Line’s railroad freight yards, we would hear the sounds of countless trains passing through our neighborhood every night. Couplers clanking, bells clanging, horns blowing, and the thunderous crash of empty boxcars and <b>grain</b> <b>hoppers</b> being shunted together into new trains, were all commonplace. Indeed, so commonplace I began to no longer hear them. Like {{the din of the}} workday, for me, they faded into the night. Many of La Crosse’s railroads have faded into history.

These early wagons were of all wood construction, but later types had wooden bodies on steel underframes, then followed by all steel wagons.

40|$|PACS. 83. 50 Tq – Wave propagation, shocks, fracture, {{and crack}} healing. Abstract. – The flow of {{granular}} matter such as sand is often {{characterized by the}} motion of a thin superficial layer near the free surface, while {{the bulk of the}} solid remains immobile. A pair of equations called the BCRE equations (Bouchaud J-P., Cates M. E., Ravi Prakash J. and Edwards S. F. J. Phys. 4 (1994) 1383) have been proposed to model these flows and account for the dynamic exchange of mass between moving and stationary grains using the simplest kinematic considerations. We uncover a new conservation law for the BCRE equations and its variants that unifies a variety of recent special solutions and show that these equations support simple waves, and are capable of finite time singularities that correspond to propagating erosion fronts. The flow of sand in a hourglass, the ripples on a beach and the clogging of a <b>grain</b> <b>hopper</b> are commonplace examples of our experience with particulate matter. The study of these materials cuts across the traditional boundaries of solids, fluids and gases; the finite angle of repose of a mound of sand is like that of a solid that preserves its shape, a snow avalanche is reminiscent of a flowing fluid, and the motion of a sediment suspension is like that of a dilute gas.

40|$|Abstract. The {{main issue}} in the joint {{operation}} of a grain harvester and a transport vehicle is determining {{the moment when the}} vehicle has to start travelling to the harvester, so that it will arrive at it when the hopper is full. The result of the incorrect determining of that moment is that the productivity of the transport vehicle is not efficiently used and in the case when the hopper is unloaded at a harvester stantstill position, the harvester productivity is also reduced due to more frequent stops. The article proposes a method for determining the part of the grain harvester hopper volume after the filling of which the signalling shall be switched on indicating to the vehicle driver when to start moving toward the harvester. The results of real measurements are shown on different farms of the time of movement of the vehicle to the harvester for unloading. An analysis of the results has been {{made on the basis of}} the developed method as well and recommendations have been made to regulate the time of switching on the signalling. A nomogram has been proposed for determining the part of the <b>grain</b> <b>hopper</b> volume after the filling of which the signalling is to be switched on depending on the ratio between the time for moving of the vehicle and the time for filling the grain harvester hopper to the top...|$|E

This document is disseminated under the sponsorship of the Department of Transportation, University Transportation Centers Program, in the interest of information exchange. The U. S. government assumes no liability for the contents or use thereof. North Dakota’s grain producers rely on an efficient rail system to move their products to export and domestic markets. In the 1999 - 2000 crop year, approximately 69 percent of all North Dakota grains and oilseeds transported to export and domestic markets were transported by rail. A recent shift to larger <b>grain</b> <b>hopper</b> cars may threaten the viability of the state’s light-density branch line network. The old industry standard of 263, 000 -pound cars capable of hauling 100 tons of grain is being replaced with 286, 000 -pound cars capable of hauling 111 tons of grain. Many light-density branch lines can not handle these larger cars, as they have light rail in place, shallow or poor ballast, and/or deferred tie maintenance. Although it is possible to load the larger rail cars at lighter weights or operate at lower speeds on such lines, railroads operating over such lines eventually will face a decision between upgrading and abandoning lines that cannot handle the 286, 000 pound cars at ful...|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of transportation in Alberta has been crucial to its historical economic development.
