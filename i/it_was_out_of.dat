5|$|David Bell, the Home Office negotiator, kept contradicting himself, {{as if in}} a bid {{to prolong}} the negotiations. He would agree to our terms, then he would try and tell us <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his hands, and go back on his word. If <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Home Officer's hands—then whose hands was it in? I think the final stages were messed around by the Home Office so that our protest could help to divert the public's {{attention}} from the Poll Tax revolt that was going on throughout the country. As Alan Lord was snatched after being asked to negotiate on behalf of us all, this made us all more defiant about ending the protest.|$|E

5|$|Jared's silence {{leads to}} the {{breakdown}} of his relationships with both Rachel and his mother Diane.

He is unsure why he did nothing though he believes <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> loyalty to the boys who were his mates. Ricko left Jared a suicide note giving him his van, though Jared asks Cherie to dump the keys to the van in the ocean when she goes out surfing.|$|E

5|$|Part of {{the problem}} was that Bordeaux may not have {{appeared}} a plausible Allied target because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> range of fighter aircraft cover from the United Kingdom. Historian Terry Crowdy's analysis is that Ironside may have suffered simply from lack of resources. In common with other, higher-impact, Bodyguard deceptions it preyed on a concern that the Allies knew Hitler and the German High Command had discussed. Crowdy suggests that with physical deception, and more effort, Ironside could have succeeded {{in the same way as}} deceptions aimed against Calais, Normandy and the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|With {{modifications}} {{that were}} aimed at improving the ships endurance by including a diesel generator, it was launched as Velebit (P-01) in 1996. A few years later <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> service {{because of the need}} to acquire a new set of batteries, which in turn, never happened. After unsuccessful attempts of selling it to a foreign buyer, it was offered to various museums in Croatia with a final destination still pending.|$|E
5|$|As the British destroyers {{completed}} their second attack, {{they were engaged}} by three more German destroyers. The British destroyers attempted to withdraw to the west, but were pursued by the German ships. Two additional German destroyers crossed the T of the British ships and quickly knocked out Hardys forward guns. More hits to the ship's bridge and superstructure set her on fire, mortally wounded Captain Warburton-Lee and killed or wounded {{all of the other}} officers on the bridge except Paymaster Lieutenant G.H. Stanning, the Captain's Secretary. Although badly wounded, he took command and after several more hits disabled her boilers ordered her run aground at Vidrek. The First Lieutenant, who had not been present on the bridge, assumed command and ordered the ship abandoned. Some of the crew delayed doing so until the last torpedo was fruitlessly fired at a German ship and No. 4 gun fired until <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> ammunition.|$|E

5|$|Currently, Wales {{play all}} their home matches at the 74,500 {{capacity}} Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, {{which is also}} Wales' national stadium. The Millennium Stadium was first conceived in 1994, when a group redevelopment committee was set up. It was decided to replace the National Stadium at Cardiff Arms Park after a review found <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> date; new legislation also required stadia to be all seated. Construction began in September 1997, and was completed by June 1999, {{in time for the}} Rugby World Cup. The construction cost the WRU £126million, which was funded by private investment, £46million of public funds from the National Lottery, the sale of debentures to supporters (which offered guaranteed tickets in exchange for an interest-free loan), and loans. While the new ground was being built, Wales used the old Wembley Stadium for their home matchesa deal reciprocated during construction of the new Wembley, when FA Cup finals were held at the Millennium Stadium.|$|E
5|$|In September 1183, {{construction}} of the Cairo Citadel began under Saladin's orders. According to al-Maqrizi, Saladin chose the Muqattam Hills to build the citadel because the air there was fresher {{than anywhere else in}} the city, but its construction was not so much determined by the salubrious atmosphere; rather <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> defensive necessity and example of existing fortresses and citadels in Syria. The walls and towers of the northern section of the citadel are largely the works of Saladin and al-Kamil. Two of Saladin's towers were totally encased by semi-circular units. Al-Kamil completed the citadel; he strengthened and enlarged some of the existing towers, and also added a number of square towers which served as self-contained keeps. According to Richard Yeomans, the most impressive of al-Kamil's structures was the series of massive rectangular keeps which straddled the walls of the northern enclosure. All of al-Kamil's fortifications can be identified by their embossed, rusticated masonry, whereas Saladin's towers have smooth dressed stones. This heavier rustic style became a common feature in other Ayyubid fortifications, and can be seen in the Citadel of Damascus and that of Bosra in Syria.|$|E
5|$|Poling took severe {{punishment}} {{from very}} accurate bombing. Since Ventnor radar station had been knocked out already, this attack demonstrated that {{an attack on}} Fighter Command's command, communication and control system was possible. Emergency equipment had been installed on the site {{in case of a}} breakdown, but the information and reading of the radar was significantly less reliable. In fact, Poling was so badly damaged <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> action for the rest of August. Fortunately, the CH chain had a mobile radar station at the Isle of Wight to fill in for it. Another was due to be set up near Poling anyway, so the chain remained unaffected. The damage done to Kenley and Poling were no more than inconveniences to Park and Dowding. Only one WAAF member, Avis Parsons, was studying the plots at Poling up until the attack. She was awarded the Military Medal for her actions on 5 September 1940.|$|E

5|$|That night Jones and {{the eight}} men with him {{stayed in the}} ravine just under the crest. Without his radio he could not {{communicate}} {{with the rest of}} the company which he thought had been destroyed or driven off the hill. The next day when American fighter planes strafed the hilltop it confirmed his belief that no D Company men were there. Some of the men in the advanced squad made their way back to US lines, but North Koreans captured Jones and the eight men with him near the bottom of Ka-san on September 10 as they were trying to make their way through the North Korean lines. This account of the 3rd Platoon explains why, except for the 3d Squad which rejoined D Company that evening, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the action and off the crest almost as soon as it arrived on top, unknown to Kennedy and the rest of the company at the time.|$|E
5|$|In May the {{battalion}} was {{withdrawn from the}} front line for re-organisation and training. It did not return until the Third Battle of Ypres in September and October 1917, when they were committed to the fighting first at Menin Road. The 7th Battalion had 57 men killed in this phase, and then later at Broodseinde another 98 were killed. Following these battles, the 7th Battalion was withdrawn from the front line once more in December. In March 1918, however, following {{the start of the}} German Spring Offensive, {{the battalion}} was called back to help stem the tide of the German advance. As the German offensive ran out of momentum, the battalion kept up the pressure on the German line through a series of peaceful penetrations, before subsequently taking part in the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, which was launched near Amiens on 8 August 1918. As a part of this offensive, the battalion fought major actions at Lihons on 9–11 August where they captured a number of German mortars and Herleville Woods on 23 August. They continued operations until late September 1918 when they were withdrawn with a strength of just 410 men and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the line when the armistice came into effect in November. Shortly afterwards the demobilisation process began and as the battalion's numbers fell as men were repatriated back to Australia, it was amalgamated with 6th Battalion. This battalion was amalgamated with another, formed from the 5th and 8th Battalions, to form the 2nd Brigade Battalion.|$|E

25|$|Bouchard {{met with}} his {{officers}} to design the attack plan. Sir Peter Corney knew the bay from two previous visits to Monterey.

Once <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> range, Bouchard sent captain Sheppard to the Santa Rosa, leading two hundred soldiers, carrying firearms and lances.|$|E

However, the Turkish president's office said that Erdoğan was not advocating a Hitler-style government when he called for a state system with a strong executive.

25|$|After {{the success}} of Bublé's self-titled debut, DRG Records belatedly {{released}} the soundtrack from the 2001 film, Totally Blonde {{in which he had}} a co-starring role as a nightclub singer and club owner. DRG ignored the music's connection to the film by altering the title and putting a shot of Bublé on the cover, making it appear as if this was a proper Michael Bublé release.
