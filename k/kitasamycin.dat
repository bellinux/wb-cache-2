40|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of <b>kitasamycin</b> in Streptomyces kitasatoensis B- 896 {{was profoundly}} {{influenced by the}} addition of precursors to complex and defined media: l-valine and l-leucine directed biosynthesis towards the pairs A 4 /A 5 (R 2 = butyryl) and A 1 /A 3 (R 2 = isovaleryl), respectively, and total <b>kitasamycin</b> titers were doubled and quadrupled, respectively. S. kitasatoensis B- 896 was very resistant (> 20 mg/ml) to α-aminobutyric acid, an analog of l-valine, but very susceptible to l-leucine analogs 5 ′, 5 ′, 5 ′-trifluoroleucine and 4 -azaleucine (5 to 10 μg/ml). The inhibition by 4 -azaleucine could be reversed by l-leucine, but by none of the other amino acids of the pyruvate family or the amino acids of the aspartate pathway. 4 -Azaleucine-resistant mutants were isolated which {{in the absence of any}} precursors overproduced l-leucine and a <b>kitasamycin</b> complex mainly consisting of the pair A 1 /A 3. These 4 -azaleucine-resistant mutants are presumed to be regulatory mutants in which α-isopropylmalate synthase, the first enzyme of the l-leucine pathway, has become either derepressed or desensitized to leucine feedback inhibition. l-Leucine-regulatory mutants have economic value: in the absence of expensive precursors, they produce a <b>kitasamycin</b> complex in which the most potent pair A 1 /A 3 is dominant and the least active components are absent...|$|E
40|$|The {{commercial}} production of antibiotics today uses the solvent extraction method in {{the extraction of}} antibiotics. Selection of solvent in any solvent extraction process is crucial due to technical and economic reasons. In order to get better understanding {{on the effect of}} solvent on the partitioning behaviour antibiotics, selected antibiotics such as <b>kitasamycin,</b> penicillin G, rifampicin and teicoplanin from aqueous buffer solution were studied using various groups of organic solvents such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, aliphatic hydrocarbons, kerosene and paraffin, as well as with addition of various extractants in kerosene system in order to enhance solute partitioning. The effects of solvent polarity, pH, antibiotic types and extractant addition on the partitioning behaviour of antibiotics were investigated. The polarity of solvents, in general, increases with an increase in solubility parameter and dielectric constant; and with a decrease in log P. Different groups of organic solvents exhibit different solvent polarity scales. Among them, alcohols are the most favourable solvent group for the partition of antibiotics, followed by aldehydes and ketones. Meanwhile antibiotic types such as <b>kitasamycin</b> and rifampicin displayed a very high degree of partitioning especially for solvent groups of alcohol, aldehyde and ketone over the pH range. On the other hand, addition of the extractant, TOMAC in kerosene displayed excellent partitioning efficiency for all the antibiotics used except <b>kitasamycin</b> whereas AOT was the next superb extractant in kerosene system for all except penicillin G...|$|E
40|$|Fifty {{strains of}} Mycoplasma pneumoniae in L cells were tested for {{susceptibility}} to macrolide antibiotics. Rokitamycin, a new macrolide antibiotic, was most active against these organisms, with an MIC for 90 % of strains of 0. 007 microgram/ml. The MICs of erythromycin, josamycin, and <b>kitasamycin</b> for 90 % of strains were 0. 03, 0. 03, and {{greater than or}} equal to 0. 06 microgram/ml, respectively. Based on these results, rokitamycin is a promising antibiotic for the treatment of mycoplasmal infections, and further clinical investigations are needed...|$|E
40|$|The {{macrolide}} {{class of}} antimicrobials {{is characterized by}} a multi-membered lactone ring with one or more amino sugars attached. 1 Macrolides are grouped according to the number of atoms comprising the lactone ring, i. e. 12 -, 14 -, 15 - or 16 -membered-rings (Table I), each of which may have further differentiating characteristics, both chemical and biological. 2 The 14 -membered-ring group is composed of compounds of natural origin (e. g. erythro-mycin, oleandomycin) and semi-synthetic derivatives (e. g. roxithromycin, dirithromycin, clarithromycin). The 16 -membered-ring group also contains both compounds of natural origin (e. g. josamycin, spiramycin, <b>kitasamycin,</b> tylosin, midecamycin) and semi-synthetic derivatives (e. g. rokitamycin, miocamycin, tilmicosin).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the susceptibility of various strains of Mycoplasma bovis, Mycoplasma dispar, and Ureaplasma diversum, which are prevalent causes of pneumonia in calves, to 16 antimicrobial agents in vitro. The MICs of the antimicrobial agents were determined by a serial broth dilution method for 16 field strains and the type strain of M. bovis, for 19 field strains and the type strain of M. dispar, and for 17 field strains of U. diversum. Final MICs for M. bovis and M. dispar were read after 7 days and final MICs for U. diversum after 1 to 2 days. All strains tested were susceptible to tylosin, <b>kitasamycin,</b> and tiamulin but were resistant to nifuroquine and streptomycin. Most strains of U. diversum were intermediately susceptible to oxytetracycline but fully susceptible to chlortetracycline; most strains of M. bovis and M. dispar, however, were resistant to both agents. Strains of M. dispar and U. diversum were susceptible to doxycycline and minocycline, but strains of M. bovis were only intermediately susceptible. Susceptibility or resistance to chloramphenicol, spiramycin, spectinomycin, lincomycin, or enrofloxacin depended on the species but was not equal for the three species. The type strains of M. bovis and M. dispar were more susceptible to various antimicrobial agents, including tetracyclines, than the field strains. This finding might indicate that M. bovis and M. dispar strains are becoming resistant to these agents. Antimicrobial agents that are effective in vitro against all three mycoplasma species can be considered for treating mycoplasma infections in pneumonic calves. Therefore, tylosin, <b>kitasamycin,</b> and tiamulin may be preferred over oxytetracycline and chlortetracycline...|$|E

The application of various thin-layer chromatography, paper chromatography, gas chromatography, {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} and capillary zone electrophoresis procedures for their analysis are described. These techniques have been applied to the separation and quantitative analysis of the macrolides in fermentation media, purity assessment of raw materials, assay of pharmaceutical dosage forms and the measurement of clinically useful macrolide antibiotics in biological samples such as blood, plasma, serum, urine and tissues.

40|$|A high {{performance}} liquid chromatography method coupled to coulometric detection {{has been applied}} for the determination, in a single run, of up to eight macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin (ERY), tylosin (TYL), tilmicosin (TILM), spiramycin 2 (SPI 2), spiramycin 3 (SPI 3), josamycin (JOS), <b>kitasamycin</b> (KIT), and rosamicin (ROS)) in spiked porcine and bovine urine. Quantification was performed using matrix- matched calibration with roxithromycin (ROX) as the internal standard. The detection limits for each drug were below 3. 5 ng injected (equivalent to an initial concentration below 0. 07 mg L- 1) for porcine urine and below 5 ng injected (equivalent to an initial concentration below 0. 10 mg L- 1) for bovine urine. Recoveries from urine samples spiked at three different concentrations within the linear range were not significantly dependent on concentration. The entire procedure provides average macrolide recoveries ranging from 69. 7 to 96. 6 % for bovine urine and from 75. 5 and 96. 1 % for porcine urine. JRC. D. 8 -Food safety and qualit...|$|E
40|$|The MICs of 18 {{antimicrobial}} agents used against strains of three porcine Mycoplasma species {{were determined by}} a serial broth dilution method. Twenty field strains of M. hyorhinis, ten field strains of M. hyopneumoniae, six field strains of M. flocculare, and the type strains of these species were tested. Twelve field strains and the type strain of M. hyorhinis were also tested by an agar dilution method. Tests were read at various time points. When the broth dilution method was used, the final MIC had to be read 2 days after color changes had stopped. MICs of tetracycline, oxytetracycline, doxycycline, and minocycline were low for the three Mycoplasma species tested. MICs of chlortetracycline were 8 to 16 times higher than MICs of the other tetracyclines. Spiramycin, tylosin, <b>kitasamycin,</b> spectinomycin, tiamulin, lincomycin, and clindamycin were effective against all strains of M. hyorhinis and M. hyopneumoniae. The quinolones were highly effective against M. hyopneumoniae but less effective against M. hyorhinis. The susceptibility patterns for M. hyopneumoniae and M. flocculare were similar...|$|E
40|$|The erm {{family of}} 23 S rRNA adenine-N 6 -methyltransferases confers {{resistance}} to all macrolide-lincosamide-streptograminB (MLS) antibiotics, {{but not all}} MLS antibiotics induce synthesis of Erm methyltransferase with equal efficiency in a given organism. The induction efficiency of a test panel of MLS antibiotics was studied by using two translational attenuator-lac reporter gene fusion constructs, one based on ermSV from Streptomyces viridochromogenes NRRL 2860 and the other based on ermC from Staphylococcus aureus RN 2442. Four types of responses which were correlated with the macrolide ring size were seen, as follows: group 1, both ermSV and ermC were induced by the 14 -membered-ring macrolides erythromycin, lankamycin, and matromycin, {{as well as by}} the lincosamide celesticetin; group 2, neither ermSV nor ermC was induced by the 12 -membered-ring macrolide methymycin or by the lincosamide lincomycin or the streptogramin type B antibiotic ostreogrycin B; group 3, ermSV was selectively induced over ermC by the 16 -membered-ring macrolides carbomycin, chalco-mycin, cirramycin, <b>kitasamycin,</b> maridomycin, and tylosin; and group 4, ermC was selectively induced over ermSV by the 14 -membered-ring macrolide megalomicin. These data suggest that the leader peptide determines the specificity of induction by different classes of MLS antibiotics and that for a given attenuator, a major factor which determines whether a given macrolide induces resistance is its size. The erm family of rRNA methylases is one of the majo...|$|E
40|$|A {{novel and}} {{suitable}} clean-up method that allows, {{for the first}} time, the simultaneous determination of a rather large number of macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin, rosamicin, spiramycin, tylosin, <b>kitasamycin</b> and josamycin in feedingstuffs by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD) is presented in this work. The effectiveness of the developed clean-up method allows the quantification of the target macrolides in poultry feed using standard calibration curves instead of matrix matched standards, which overcomes the general problem of finding representative blanks. Furthermore an additional back extraction included in the sample preparation procedure allows the determination of an additional macrolide (oleandomycin) with detection limits, expressed as apparent concentration in poultry feed, ranging from 0. 04 to 0. 22 mg kg- 1 and relative standard deviation values ranging from 3. 6 to 10. 1 % depending on the target analyte. Moreover, this additional step has been proven to enlarge {{the scope of the}} method by the extension of its applicability, at the target level of concentration, to other animal feedingstuffs such as pig and cattle. The analysis of real feedingstuffs containing macrolides demonstrated the fitness for purpose of the whole analytical procedure as well as a good fitting between real and spiked samples. The proposed methods appeared therefore as a sound alternative in the frame of control (e. g. for post-screening purposes) and/or monitoring surveillance programmes at the target level of 1. 0 mg kg- 1 established according to the reported lowest dosage of additive needed to lead a growth promoting effect.

40|$|Early-life {{antibiotic}} interventions {{can change}} the predisposition to disease by disturbing the gut microbiota. However, the impact of antibiotics on gut microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract is not completely understood, although antibiotic-induced alterations in the distal gut have been reported. Here, employing a piglet model, the microbial composition was analyzed by high-throughput 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and PICRUSt predictions of metagenome function. The present study showed clear spatial variation of microbial communities in the stomach and intestine, {{and found that the}} administration of antibiotics (a mixture of olaquindox, oxytetracycline calcium, <b>kitasamycin)</b> in early life caused markedly differential alterations in the compartmentalized microbiota, with major alterations in their spatial variation in the lumen of the stomach and small intestine. In piglets fed an antibiotic-free diet, most of the variation in microbial communities was concentrated in gut segments and niches (lumen/mucosa). The microbial diversity was higher in the lumen of stomach and duodenum than that in ileum. The early-life antibiotic intervention decreased the abundance of some Lactobacillus species and increased the abundance of potentially pathogenic Streptococcus suis in the lumen of the stomach and small intestine. Interestingly, the intervention increased the abundance of Treponema only in the colonic lumen and that of Faecalibacterium only in the ileal mucosa. Furthermore, the antibiotic intervention exerted location-specific effects on the functional potential involved in the phosphotransferase system (decreased sucrose phosphotransferase in the stomach) and antibiotic-resistance genes (increased in the colon). These results point to an early-life antibiotic-induced dramatic and location-specific shift in the gut microbiota, with profound impact in the foregut and less impact in the hindgut. Collectively, these findings provide new insights into the membership of the microbiota along the gastrointestinal tract of piglets and highlight the importance of considering the foregut microbiota in health management of piglets at early life. </p...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of sub-MICs of erythromycin (EM) and other macrolide antibiotics on the serum sensitivity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa S- 6 grown for 36 and 48 h on agar with 10 micrograms of EM per ml (1 / 10 th the MIC) showed significantly increased sensitivity to human serum bactericidal activity compared with those of bacteria grown on agar without EM (P < 0. 05). No changes in serum sensitivity were observed in bacteria grown for less than 24 h. This increased sensitivity was apparent even at a concentration of 1. 5 micrograms of EM per ml (1 / 67 th the MIC) in bacteria grown for 48 h (P < 0. 01). Among the other macrolide antibiotics tested, clarithromycin also enhanced sensitivity to serum, but there were no changes in the sensitivities of bacteria grown on agar with <b>kitasamycin,</b> josamycin, rokitamycin, or oleandomycin even at a concentration of 12 micrograms/ml (1 / 16 th, 1 / 16 th, 1 / 8 th, and 1 / 33 rd the MICs, respectively). P. aeruginosa S- 6 grown on agar with subinhibitory concentrations of EM showed decreased cell surface hydrophobicity in a dose-dependent manner, whereas oleandomycin and rokitamycin, even at a concentration of 12 micrograms/ml, induced a slight decrease in hydrophobicity which was approximately equivalent to that of 1. 5 micrograms of EM per ml. Among six other strains of the nonmucoid phenotype, three strains became more sensitive to serum by exposure to 10 micrograms of EM per ml for 48 h. In contrast, no evident correlation between EM treatment and a change in serum sensitivity was observed in six strains of the mucoid phenotype, as judged by the results of experiments with both 2 and 0. 4 % serum. These results show that EM at subinhibitory concentrations enhances the serum sensitivity of some P. aeruginosa strains. Since induced serum sensitivity was accompanied by a decrease in bacterial cell surface hydrophobicity, EM may render P. aeruginosa more serum sensitive by changing the cell surface structure(s) of this organism...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of adding essential oils to the diet of weaned pigs on performance, nutrient utilization, immune response and intestinal health. A total of 96 weaning pigs (8. 37 ± 1. 58 kg) were allotted to one of three dietary treatments. The treatments consisted of an unsupplemented basal diet (negative control, NC) or similar diets supplemented with 0. 01 % of an essential oil product which contained 18 % thymol and cinnamaldehyde (EOD) as well as a diet supplemented with 0. 19 % of an antibiotic mixture which provided 150 ppm chlortetracycline, 80 ppm colistin sulfate and 50 ppm <b>kitasamycin</b> (positive control, PC). Each treatment was provided to eight pens of pigs with four pigs per pen. Over the entire 35 d experiment, ADG and fecal score were improved (p< 0. 05) for pigs fed the PC and EOD compared with the NC. Dry matter and crude protein digestibility as well as lymphocyte proliferation for pigs fed the PC and EOD diets were increased significantly compared with NC (p< 0. 05). IGF-I levels in plasma were significantly increased (p< 0. 05) in pigs fed the PC diet compared with pigs fed the NC diet. Interleukin- 6 concentration was lower (p< 0. 05) and the tumor necrosis factor-α level was higher (p< 0. 05) in the plasma of pigs fed the EOD diet than the NC diet. Plasma total antioxidant capacity level increased (p< 0. 05) in pigs fed the EOD diet compared with pigs fed the NC. Villus height to crypt depth ratio in the jejunum was greater (p< 0. 05) in pigs fed the PC and EOD diets than the NC. The numbers of E. coli in the cecum, colon and rectum were reduced (p< 0. 05) in pigs fed the PC and EOD diets compared with the control. In the colon, the ratio of Lactobacilli to E. coli was increased (p< 0. 05) in pigs fed the EOD diet compared with NC diet. Total aerobe numbers in the rectum were decreased (p< 0. 05) in pigs fed the PC and EOD diets compared with the control. Collectively, these results indicate that blends of essential oils could be a candidate for use as an alternative to traditional antibiotics in weaning pig diets...|$|E
