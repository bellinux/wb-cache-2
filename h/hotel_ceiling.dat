50|$|After the renovations, the {{building}} was reopened in 1902 as the Hyde Park Hotel, London’s newest and grandest <b>hotel.</b> The <b>ceilings</b> and marble floors had survived, and period fireplaces {{in the style of}} Louis XV and XVI were installed, while the furnishings echoed the 18th century style of Sheraton and Hepplewhite.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: One of {{the roof}} designs. The <b>hotel</b> has seven <b>ceiling</b> murals by Evans & Brown, a {{decorative}} painting studio based in San Francisco, California.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} of the <b>hotel</b> has painted <b>ceilings</b> and a monumental fireplace, designed by Nicolas Bachelier. The interior decor of the Gaston Virebent manufacture completes the interior decoration.|$|R
2500|$|The Great Southern Hotel–described by Jack Shank, a local historian, as [...] "the hotel"–was five stories {{tall and}} {{contained}} 150 rooms. Costing $175,000 (today $) and taking up half a city block at 6th Street and 23rd Avenue, {{the building was}} {{the largest and most}} expensive in the city. A restaurant was located on the roof, and a number of social events were held in second-floor parlors. Luxuries standard in the <b>hotel</b> included <b>ceiling</b> fans and reading lamps in every room, ornate oak woodwork throughout the building, and a public stenographer to assist patrons.|$|R
50|$|Another project Le Brun {{worked on}} was <b>Hôtel</b> Lambert. The <b>ceiling</b> {{in the gallery}} of Hercules was painted by him. Le Brun started work on the project in 1650, shortly after his return from Italy. The {{decoration}} continued intermittently over twelve years or so, as it was interrupted by the renovation of Vaux le Vicomte.|$|R
50|$|Australian painter Hugh Sawrey {{spent many}} years in the Kogan area. He often painted murals on local {{buildings}} to pay his bills. He first visited the town after he returned from military service in World War II, seeking work on cattle stations. He painted murals for the lounge of the Kogan <b>Hotel</b> and the <b>ceiling</b> of the Kogan post office.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of an architect's {{concept of}} the Ballroom No. 2 at the Los Angeles Statler Hotel. "Los Angeles Statler [...] the second largest of the four Ballrooms on the {{function}} floor of the new <b>hotel.</b> Drawing shows <b>ceiling</b> lighting design and windows through which guests can get {{a view of the}} Gardens and Swimming Pool" [...] typed note attached to verso. Verso dated, "February 22, 1951 "...|$|R
5000|$|The {{interior}} was gutted and the exterior was cleaned and repaired {{in the late}} 1980s. The only internal remnant of the <b>hotel</b> is the <b>ceiling</b> of the big entrance lobby. This lobby has a huge chandelier taken from the Monte Carlo casino. The shopping area is organized around four large courts, hence the French name [...] "Les Cours". Under the main skylight there are six bird-human sculptures by the Inuit artist David Ruben Piqtoukun.|$|R
50|$|Many of Sawrey's {{works were}} {{in the small town}} of Kogan on the Darling Downs as he often painted murals on local {{buildings}} to pay his bills. He first visited the town after he returned from World War II, seeking work on cattle stations. In Kogan, he found encouragement for this art as well as inspiration from the rural area. He painted murals for the lounge of the Kogan <b>Hotel</b> and the <b>ceiling</b> of the Kogan post office.|$|R
50|$|A {{documentary}} film, Last Call at the Gladstone Hotel, {{was created}} by Last Call Productions as {{a portrait of the}} effects of urban renewal on the poor, as the Gladstone was being converted from a skid row flophouse to arts and music hotspot. It was shot over a span of five years, showing that the developers' plan for a gradual restoration with staff and residents remaining upstairs, while downstairs the bar served designer drinks to new, affluent clientele didn't work. City inspectors demanded a complete rewiring, the boiler blew up leaving the <b>hotel</b> without heat, <b>ceilings</b> leaked, walls crumbled and management had to cope with this reality.|$|R
5000|$|Germain Brice, in Description {{nouvelle}} de la ville de Paris (1707) gave an admiring {{description of}} the furnishing of the <b>Hôtel</b> de Condé:"The <b>ceiling</b> of the bedchamber and of the cabinet of Mme la Princesse have been painted by de Sève... As for furniture, {{it is difficult to}} see any in any other palace richer or in greater quantity. One finds here as well pictures by masters of the first rank, among others a Baptism of Our Lord by Albano... extraordinary tapestries and hardstone carvings more than in any other place. A numerous library is conserved here as well, composed of curious books and the rarest of hand-drawn maps." ...|$|R
50|$|The watchtower was {{the last}} of the series of Mary Colter-designed visitor {{concession}} structures at the Grand Canyon until her renovation of the Bright Angel Lodge in 1935. The tower was designed to resemble an Ancient Pueblo Peoples watchtower, but its size dwarfs any known Pueblan-built tower. The closest prototypes for such a structure may be found at Hovenweep National Monument. The structure is composed of a circular coursed masonry tower rising from a rubble base. The base was intentionally designed to convey a partly ruinous appearance, perhaps of an older structure on which the watchtower was later built. The base is arranged within a large circle with the tower to the north. Tiny windows are irregularly disposed, some of which are themselves irregular in shape. The main space is the Kiva Room in the base structure, apparently roofed with logs that were salvaged from the old Grandview <b>Hotel.</b> The <b>ceiling</b> is a false structure concealing the roof structure that supports an observation deck. The Kiva Room features a fireplace with a large picture window directly above where the chimney would ordinarily go. Smoke is drawn away through an offset, concealed flue. The room still contains its original furnishings, which are part of the historic designation. A separate, apparently ruinous structure was actually built in that form to provide a storage place for firewood.|$|R
5000|$|The {{hotel was}} the most luxurious in Los Angeles {{for a number of}} years until the {{construction}} of the Biltmore Hotel three blocks west in 1923. The Ambassador Hotels System sold the hotel in 1927, and it was sold again in 1930, before going bankrupt and closing in 1932. The <b>hotel's</b> gold leaf <b>ceilings,</b> furniture, chandeliers and other fittings were sold in 1934 to pay off debts. The hotel was sold again in 1937, to film producer Phil Goldstone, who renovated and reopened it. At this point, the original two-story lobby was cut into two rooms, a mezzanine ballroom with the decorative ceiling from the original lobby and a modern art deco lobby below. The hotel changed hands multiple times after World War II. It was acquired by real estate developer S. Jon Kreedman in 1961, who renovated it in 1970 in a faux-Victorian style.|$|R
