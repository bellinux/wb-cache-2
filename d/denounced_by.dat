5|$|Lon Nol saw Cambodia's {{population}} of 400,000 ethnic Vietnamese as possible hostages to prevent PAVN attacks and ordered their roundup and internment. Cambodian soldiers and civilians then unleashed a reign of terror, murdering thousands of Vietnamese civilians. On 15 April for example, 800 Vietnamese {{men had been}} rounded up at the village of Churi Changwar, tied together, executed, and their bodies dumped into the Mekong River. They then floated downstream into South Vietnam. Cambodia's actions were <b>denounced</b> <b>by</b> both the North and South Vietnamese governments.|$|E
5|$|On {{a similar}} note, both {{countries}} {{would continue to}} conceal any war crimes committed by the other side {{for the remainder of}} the war. The Holocaust was systematically concealed by the leadership in Tokyo, just as Japanese war crimes, e.g. the situation in China, were kept secret from the German public. An example would be the atrocities committed by the Japanese Army in Nanking in 1937, which were <b>denounced</b> <b>by</b> German industrialist John Rabe. Subsequently, the German leadership ordered Rabe back to Berlin, confiscating all his reports and prohibiting any further discussion of the topic.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish anarcho-syndicalists, {{who opposed}} the war out of doctrinaire cynicism and a belief that neither faction were on the workers' side, angrily repudiated their former idols (including Kropotkin, Malato and Grave) after {{discovering}} they had authored the manifesto. A small number of anarchists in Galicia and Asturias dissented and were heatedly <b>denounced</b> <b>by</b> the majority of Catalan anarcho-syndicalists (who prevailed in the anarchist union Confederación Nacional del Trabajo).|$|E

5|$|By {{contrast}} Yoshiaki Itakura {{adopted an}} even stricter standard than Hata, advocating that only Chinese soldiers captured in uniform and then killed be included as massacre victims. He argued that Chinese {{soldiers who had}} thrown away their uniforms were legally executed because {{the laws of war}} at the time did not apply to them, though this line of reasoning is hotly disputed by other historians. Most Japanese ultranationalists who deny the Nanking Massacre admit that the Japanese Army killed a large number of Chinese POWs, though they consider these to be legal executions, an argument <b>denounced</b> <b>by</b> mainstream historians.|$|E

Carmon's column was <b>denounced</b> <b>by</b> Munn and the Daily Show female writers, producers, and correspondents, 32 of whom posted a rebuttal {{on the show}}'s website in which they asserted that {{the description of the}} Daily Show office given by the Jezebel piece was not accurate.

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the Russian westward {{offensive}} of 1918–1919 and of a series of escalating battles which resulted in the Poles advancing eastward, on 21 April 1920, Marshal Piłsudski (as his rank had been since March 1920) signed a military alliance (the Treaty of Warsaw) with Ukrainian leader Symon Petliura to conduct joint operations against Soviet Russia. The goal of the Polish-Ukrainian treaty was to establish an independent Ukraine and independent Poland in alliance, resembling that once existing within Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth In return, Petliura gave up Ukrainian claims to western lands of Galicia being a historical part of the Crown of Poland, for which he was <b>denounced</b> <b>by</b> Ukrainian nationalist leaders.|$|E

5|$|Ravalomanana's {{announcement}} sparked retaliatory {{actions by}} the Ratsiraka administration, resulting in frequent defamatory attacks {{in the press and}} a court judgment fining him 300 billion Malagasy francs (55.6 million Euros) in unpaid back taxes, and two other lawsuits in relation to his management of Tiko, which were later settled out of court. These attacks were <b>denounced</b> <b>by</b> spokesmen for Ravalomanana's campaign support network, Tiako iMadagasikara (TIM), and in speeches the candidate delivered in urban and rural areas across the island, with travel made possible by his considerable personal wealth and the airplane and seven distribution helicopters registered to Tiko.

5|$|The Jacquard loom was {{immediately}} <b>denounced</b> <b>by</b> workers, who accused it of causing unemployment, but soon {{it had become}} vital to the industry. The loom was declared public property in 1806, and Jacquard was rewarded with a pension and a royalty on each machine. In 1834 there were a total of 2885 Jacquard looms in Lyon alone. The Canut revolt in 1831 foreshadowed many of the larger worker uprisings of the Industrial Revolution. The canuts occupied the city of Lyon, and would not relinquish it until a bloody repression by the army, led by Marshal Soult. A second revolt, similar to the first, took place in 1834.|$|E

5|$|After {{coming of}} age, the Avatar is sent by Garon to inspect a Hoshidan {{fortress}} above the Bottomless Canyon. However, one of Garon's men, Hans, provokes {{a battle with}} the Hoshidans and throws the Avatar's mentor Gunter into the Canyon. The Avatar is found and captured by Hoshidan soldiers, who recognize them as a long-lost member of the Hoshidan royal family. The Avatar is brought to meet their blood relatives and Azura at the capital city. However, soldiers attack the city and a hooded assassin attempts to kill the Avatar. Mikoto shields them {{at the cost of}} her life. In the aftermath, the Avatar comes into possession of a legendary sword called Yato, said to belong to the one who will save the world. In the opening battle between the two kingdoms, the Avatar's two families meet, and the Avatar is forced to choose between siding with Hoshido and Nohr. In the Birthright and Conquest routes, the Avatar chooses either their biological or adopted family, respectively. This causes them to be <b>denounced</b> <b>by</b> the other side, and they are gradually forced to fight them.|$|E

When Sati and her soldiers {{are on the verge}} of losing against the lions, a group of Naga soldiers led by a man and a woman arrive and assist them in killing the lions. The Naga woman reveals herself to be Kali, Sati's twin sister. She was <b>denounced</b> <b>by</b> their father Daksha since she was born with deformities, including two extra, functioning hands. The man reveals himself as Ganesh, Sati's first child, whom she believed to have died at child birth. Since Ganesh was also born with deformities, which led to his face resembling that of an elephant’s, Daksha denounced him and lied to Sati. Both Kali and Ganesh are brought back to Kashi by Sati and they wait for Shiva's arrival.|$|E
5|$|Deflated by his situation, Nguyễn Ánh asked Pigneau {{to appeal}} for French aid, and allowed Pigneau {{to take his}} son Nguyễn Phúc Cảnh with him {{as a sign of}} good faith. This came about after Nguyễn Ánh had {{considered}} enlisting English, Dutch, Portuguese and Spanish assistance. Pigneau advised against Nguyễn Ánh's original plan to seek Dutch aid from Batavia, fearing that the support of the Protestant Dutch would hinder the advancement of Catholicism. Pigneau left Vietnam in December, arriving in Pondicherry, India in February 1785 with Nguyễn Ánh's royal seal. Nguyễn Ánh had authorized him to make concessions to France in return for military assistance. The French administration in Pondicherry, led by acting governor Coutenceau des Algrains, was conservative in outlook and resolutely opposed intervention in southern Vietnam. To compound the already complex situation, Pigneau was <b>denounced</b> <b>by</b> Spanish Franciscans in the Vatican, and he sought to transfer his political mandate to Portuguese forces. The Portuguese had earlier offered Nguyễn Ánh 56 ships to use against the Tây Sơn.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Katanga secession, {{political}} negotiations {{began to}} reconcile the disparate political factions. The negotiations coincided with the formation of an émigré political group, the Conseil National de Libération (CNL), by dissident Lumumbists and others in neighbouring Congo-Brazzaville. The negotiations culminated {{in the creation of a}} new, revised constitution, known as the Luluabourg Constitution, after the city in which it was written, to create a compromise balance of power. The new constitution increased the power of the presidency, ending the system of joint consultation between President and Prime Minister, and appeased federalists by increasing the number of provinces from six to 21 while increasing their autonomy. The constitution also changed the name of the state from the Republic of the Congo to Democratic Republic of the Congo. The constitution was passed in a constitutional referendum in June 1964 and Parliament was dissolved to await new elections. Kasa-Vubu appointed Tshombe, the exiled Katangese leader, as interim Prime Minister. Although personally capable, and supported as an anti-communist by Western powers, Tshombe was <b>denounced</b> <b>by</b> other African leaders such as King Hassan II of Morocco as an imperialist puppet for his role in the Katangese secession.|$|E
5|$|It {{took four}} years until they reunited, {{when she and}} Agrippa came to Rome in 75. The reasons for this long absence are unclear, but {{have been linked to}} {{possible}} opposition to her presence by Gaius Licinius Mucianus, a political ally of emperor Vespasian who died sometime between 72 and 78. Agrippa was given the rank of praetor, while Berenice resumed her relationship with Titus, living with him at the palace and reportedly acting in every respect as his wife. The ancient historian Cassius Dio writes that Berenice was at the height of her power during this time, and if it can be any indication as to how influential she was, Quintilian records an anecdote in his Institutio Oratoria where, to his astonishment, he found himself pleading a case on Berenice's behalf where she herself presided as the judge. The Roman populace however perceived the Eastern Queen as an intrusive outsider, and when the pair was publicly <b>denounced</b> <b>by</b> Cynics in the theatre, Titus caved in to the pressure and sent her away.|$|E
5|$|After Euro 2008, {{defensive}} stalwart Lilian Thuram {{retired from}} the team. To mitigate his absence, Domenech moved Abidal into the centre-back position, allowing Evra to take over as starting left back. In the team's first competitive match since Euro 2008, against Austria, Evra provided the assist for France's only goal scored by Sidney Govou in a surprising 3–1 defeat. During the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign, Evra participated in ten of the team's 12 matches, which included both legs in the team's playoff round win over the Republic of Ireland. On 26 May 2010, Evra captained the national team {{for the first time}} in a friendly match against Costa Rica; France won the match 2–1. He was subsequently named the captain for the 2010 World Cup ahead of Thierry Henry, who was relegated to the bench for the tournament. Evra wore the armband in the team's first two matches, a 0–0 draw with Uruguay and a 2–0 loss to Mexico. On 19 June, striker Nicolas Anelka was dismissed from the squad after reportedly having a dispute, in which obscenities were passed, with Domenech during half-time of the team's loss to Mexico. The resulting disagreement over Anelka's exclusion between the players, the coaching staff and France Football Federation (FFF) officials resulted in Evra leading a player protest against the decision on 20 June, in which the players refused to train. Prior to leading the revolt, Evra had got into a verbal argument with national team fitness coach Robert Duverne. The strike was <b>denounced</b> <b>by</b> the FFF as well as French government officials. The following day, the players returned to training without incident. As a result of the mutiny, Evra was stripped of the captaincy and benched for the team's final group stage match against hosts South Africa. France lost 2–1 and were eliminated from the competition.|$|E
