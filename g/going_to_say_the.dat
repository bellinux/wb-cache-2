However, on July 6, 2009, Ryan Ross and Jon Walker announced via the band's official website {{that the two}} were leaving the band. In an interview following the split, Ross explained that he first brought the idea to Smith in late June 2009 over lunch: [...] "Spencer and I had lunch and caught up for a while, and then the big question came up, like, 'Well, {{what do you want}} to do?' and I said, 'Well, I think it might be best if we kind of do our own thing for a while,' and he said, 'I'm glad you said that, because I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> same thing,'" [...] Ross recalled. [...] "And there was really no argument, which is really the best way that could've worked out." [...] Ross said the split was largely due to creative differences between him and Urie. Urie wanted the band to explore a more polished pop sound, while Ross – and, by extension, Walker – was interested in making retro-inspired rock.|$|E

The statement, in part, read: [...] "Ryan Ross and Jon Walker will be leaving Panic at the Disco {{to embark on a}} musical excursion of their own. Though the four of us have made music together in the past, we’ve creatively evolved in different directions which has compromised what each of us want to personally achieve. Over the years, we have remained close and honest with each other, which helped us to realize that our goals were different and that parting ways is truly what is best for each of us."

2500|$|Douglas found Stern's next job, hosting mornings at album-oriented rock station WWDC in Washington, D.C. Stern was {{cautious}} about the offer at first {{as the general}} manager [...] "was not really aware of what I did", but accepted the offer and started on March 2, 1981. During his time relocating from Detroit, Stern spent several weeks planning out a new show, determined to become more successful as the station presented a good chance for him to work in New York City, his career goal. He was determined to [...] "kill my competition. I {{was going to say}} whatever the fuck I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> ... <b>The</b> first step was to put my team together". He sought a co-host {{with a sense of humor}} to riff with on news and current events. The station then paired Stern with Robin Quivers, a former nurse in the air force and news reporter at WFBR in Baltimore. Quivers was sent a tape of Stern interviewing a prostitute on the air, and accepted the job without meeting him. She assumed she [...] "would come in and do the news ... but it wasn't that way". Despite several issues management had over content, which led to the installation of a seven-second delay to censor questionable moments, Stern [...] "kept chipping away at management's archaic approach and we began to assemble the program I had envisioned", which included the addition of Norris as his writer and producer. In one incident, Stern revealed his wife's miscarriage on the air. In January 1982, Stern had the second highest rated morning show in the city.|$|E
60|$|And let me <b>say</b> that <b>the</b> man of {{our days}} whose {{writings}} exemplify most thoroughly what I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> is <b>the</b> justly revered Mr. Thomas Carlyle.|$|R

6000|$|... "No--be quiet! You {{know what}} I mean. What were we talking about? Oh! I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that <b>the</b> most {{fascinating}} thing about you always was that ironical way of yours." ...|$|R
60|$|Then Harringay rose {{after the}} manner of the debater who is {{conscious}} that he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> popular thing.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, it wouldn't," [...] {{said the}} old trader, with the air and {{decision}} of--we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> great Mogul, but {{perhaps it would be}} more emphatic and appropriate to say--The MacFearsome.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>the</b> king is {{generally}} {{dressed in a}} London hat only, or a Manchester pair of braces, or one epaulette, or an uniform coat with his legs in the sleeves, or something of that kind.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You would not, Mr. Derriman. But, as you was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> next, <b>the</b> fire in yer veins won't let ye do that. You are valiant; very good: {{you don't}} want to husband yer valiance at home. The arg'ment is plain.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Maybe he has been," [...] replied Mr. Crewe. [...] "I told Waters to keep {{everybody}} out to-night because I {{want to know}} exactly what I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> on <b>the</b> floor tomorrow. I don't want 'em to give me trouble. Did you bring some of those papers with you?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well," [...] I went on smoothly, and I {{hoped to}} render what I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> means of enlightening him without offence {{concerning}} the little mistake {{he had just}} made with the waitress, [...] "of course we don't take that in its closest literality." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye, very true, my dear," [...] {{cried the}} latter, though Jane {{had not spoken}} a word--"I was just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> same thing.

60|$|The {{door was}} opened {{cautiously}} enough; and out looked, to {{the shame of}} knighthood, be it said, two or three knights who had taken shelter in the bower with the ladies. Whatever they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> ladies forestalled, for, rushing out across the prostrate bear, they overwhelmed Hereward with praises, thanks, and, after the straightforward custom of those days, with substantial kisses.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, Miss Claxon," [...] Fane answered, {{with the}} sorrowful respect which he always showed Clementina, now, [...] "I'll be right there." [...] But he waited a moment, either in {{expression}} {{of his personal}} independence, or from curiosity to know what <b>the</b> shoeman was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> of <b>the</b> bronze slippers.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I think,' said Mary, leaning forward, and {{speaking}} low, 'that {{he did not}} mean it to be explained away.

60|$|The school, or the {{remnants}} of it, waited impatiently while the prefect whose turn it was to read stammered nervously through the lesson.

6000|$|... "Of course I do," [...] {{she told}} him, quietly enough and yet very convincingly. [...] "If I {{did not care}} I should not be here. If I did not care, I should not be <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> things to you which I am going to say now.

6000|$|He gave me {{a little}} shock. I thought he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> [...] "son of the poet" [...] as usual; but his mind was not running on such vanities now. His unspoken thought must have gone on [...] "and uncle of my girls." [...] I suspect {{that he had been}} roughly handled by Captain Anthony up there, and the resentment gave a {{tremendous}} fillip to the slow play of his wits. Those men of sober fancy, when anything rouses their imaginative faculty, are very thorough. [...] "Just think!" [...] he cried. [...] "The three of them crowded into a four-wheeler, and Anthony sitting deferentially opposite that astonished old jail-bird!" ...|$|E
60|$|Now, {{the most}} {{important}} object of all educational schemes is to catch these exceptional people, and turn them {{to account for the}} good of society. No man can say where they will crop up; like their opposites, the fools and knaves, they appear sometimes in the palace, and sometimes in the hovel; but the great thing to be aimed at, I was almost <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> most important end of all social arrangements, is to keep these glorious sports of Nature from being either corrupted by luxury or starved by poverty, and to put them into the position in which they can do the work for which they are especially fitted.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't wish {{to waste}} your time, sir," [...] he answered. [...] "If {{you are not}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{anything}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> others before then I will go away." ...|$|R

40|$|Pritchard's {{right about}} {{something}} {{that most of his}} critics will get wrong. 1 It doesn't make sense <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that <b>the</b> skeptic is wrong about the scope of our knowledge if we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that <b>the</b> way things really are has no bearing on what reasons we have for our beliefs.

6000|$|It is {{difficult}} to set everything down in due order; so I must revert here to what happened {{a week or two}} before. The medical officer of the port had come on board my ship {{to have a look at}} one of my crew who was ailing, and naturally enough he was asked to step into the cabin. A fellow-shipmaster of mine was there too; and in the conversation, somehow or other, the name of Jacobus came to be mentioned. It was pronounced with no particular reverence by the other man, I believe. I don't remember now what I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>The</b> doctor--a pleasant, cultivated fellow, with an assured manner--prevented me by striking in, in a sour tone: ...|$|E
60|$|The ocean beach of Apemama was {{our daily}} resort. The coast is broken by shallow bays. The reef is detached, elevated, and {{includes}} a lagoon about knee-deep, the unrestful spending-basin of the surf. The beach is now of fine sand, now of broken coral. The trend of the coast being convex, scarce {{a quarter of a}} mile of it is to be seen at once; the land being so low, the horizon appears within a stone-cast; and the narrow prospect enhances the sense of privacy. Man avoids the place--even his footprints are uncommon; but a great number of birds hover and pipe there fishing, and leave crooked tracks upon the sand. Apart from these, the only sound (and I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> only society) is that of the breakers on the reef.|$|E
6000|$|I {{remember}} my mother only in some few situations, {{one of which}} was her pinning a nosegay to my breast when I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> catechism in the church, as was customary before Easter.[17] I remember also telling her on one week day that I had been at church, for our school stood in the churchyard, and we had frequent opportunities of seeing what was going on there. The occasion was, a woman doing penance in the church in a white sheet. My mother commended my having been present, expressing a hope that I should remember the circumstance {{for the rest of my}} life. 'But,' said I, 'Mama, they did not give me a penny, as I had been told they would.' 'Oh,' said she, recanting her praises, 'if that was your motive, you were very properly disappointed.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are many of {{the ladies}} about here so inquisitive, and the young gentlemen so?"--"decided" [...] she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> but changed <b>the</b> word to [...] "kind"--asked Stella of Morris as they walked homeward.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{should have}} been some touch of chivalry if not of love {{to make you feel}} that a second passion {{should have been}} {{postponed}} for a year or two. You could wait without growing old. You might have allowed yourself a little space <b>to</b> dwell--I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> on <b>the</b> sweetness of your memories.

5000|$|Csank is {{recognizable}} for {{his dark}} humor. At half-time in the losing match against the Yugoslavian team, {{when a reporter}} asked him what he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> players, he replied: [...] "Surely not, keep it up!". At {{the end of this}} match, at the interview he said that the major cause of the loss was, [...] "I didn't know, that some of my players are so lame." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly, my dear," [...] {{replied the}} Woman of the World; [...] "there is a {{deal of the}} animal in man; but--well, I was myself expressing that same {{particular}} view of him, the brute, to a very old lady with whom I was spending a winter in Brussels, many years ago now, when I was quite a girl. She had been {{a friend of my}} father's, {{and was one of the}} sweetest and kindest--I was almost <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> most perfect woman I have ever met; though as a celebrated beauty, stories, dating from the early Victorian era, were told about her. But myself I never believed them. Her calm, gentle, passionless face, crowned with its soft, silver hair--I remember my first sight of the Matterhorn on a summer's evening; somehow it at once reminded me of her." ...|$|E
60|$|The Rev. Augustus Cracklethorpe climbed {{slowly up}} the pulpit steps without an idea {{in his head}} {{of what he was}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>The</b> {{sunlight}} fell upon the upturned faces of a crowd that filled every corner of the church. So happy, so buoyant a congregation the eyes of the Rev. Augustus Cracklethorpe had never till that day looked down upon. The feeling came to him {{that he did not want}} to leave them. That they did not wish him to go, could he doubt? Only by regarding them as a collection of the most shameless hypocrites ever gathered together under one roof. The Rev. Augustus Cracklethorpe dismissed the passing suspicion as a suggestion of the Evil One, folded the neatly-written manuscript that lay before him on the desk, and put it aside. He had no need of a farewell sermon. The arrangements made could easily be altered. The Rev. Augustus Cracklethorpe spoke from his pulpit for the first time an impromptu.|$|E
60|$|Yet the {{children}} of this world are wise in their generation; and both the politician and the priest are justified by results. The living voice has an influence over human action altogether independent of the intellectual worth of that which it utters. Many years ago, I was a guest at a great City dinner. A famous orator, endowed with a voice of rare flexibility and power; a born actor, ranging with ease through every part, from refined comedy to tragic unction, was called upon to reply to a toast. The orator was a very busy man, a charming conversationalist and by no means despised a good dinner; and, I imagine, rose without having given a thought {{to what he was}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>The</b> rhythmic roll of sound was admirable, the gestures perfect, the earnestness impressive; nothing was lacking save sense and, occasionally, grammar. When the speaker sat down the applause was terrific and one of my neighbours was especially enthusiastic. So when he had quieted down, I asked him what the orator had said. And he could not tell me.|$|E
