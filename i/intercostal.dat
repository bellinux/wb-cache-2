5|$|Spinal polio, {{the most}} common form of paralytic poliomyelitis, results from viral {{invasion}} of the motor neurons of the anterior horn cells, or the ventral (front) grey matter section in the spinal column, which are responsible for movement of the muscles, including those of the trunk, limbs, and the <b>intercostal</b> muscles. Virus invasion causes inflammation of the nerve cells, leading to damage or destruction of motor neuron ganglia. When spinal neurons die, Wallerian degeneration takes place, leading to weakness of those muscles formerly innervated by the now-dead neurons. With the destruction of nerve cells, the muscles no longer receive signals from the brain or spinal cord; without nerve stimulation, the muscles atrophy, becoming weak, floppy and poorly controlled, and finally completely paralyzed. Maximum paralysis progresses rapidly (two to four days), and usually involves fever and muscle pain. Deep tendon reflexes are also affected, and are typically absent or diminished; sensation (the ability to feel) in the paralyzed limbs, however, is not affected.|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{advantages of}} the external and internal <b>intercostals</b> depend partly on {{the orientation of the}} muscle but mostly on interspace number and the position of the muscle within each interspace. Thus the external <b>intercostals</b> in the dorsal portion of the rostral interspaces have a large inspiratory mechanical advantage, but this advantage decreases ventrally and caudally such that in the ventral portion of the caudal interspaces, it is reversed into an expiratory mechanical advantage. The internal interosseous <b>intercostals</b> in the caudal interspaces also have a large expiratory mechanical advantage, but this advantage decreases cranially and, for the upper interspaces, ventrally as well. The intercartilaginous portion of the internal <b>intercostals</b> (the so-called parasternal <b>intercostals),</b> therefore, has an inspiratory mechanical advantage, whereas the triangularis sterni has a large expiratory mechanical advantage. These rostrocaudal gradients result from the nonuniform coupling between rib displacement and lung expansion, and the dorsoventral gradients result from the three-dimensional configuration of the rib cage. Such topographic differences in mechanical advantage imply that the functions of the muscles during breathing are largely determined by the topographic distributions of neural drive. The distributions of inspiratory and expiratory activity among the muscles are strikingly similar to the distributions of inspiratory and expiratory mechanical advantages, respectively. As a result, the external <b>intercostals</b> and the parasternal <b>intercostals</b> have an inspiratory function during breathing, whereas the internal interosseous <b>intercostals</b> and the triangularis sterni have an expiratory function...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the mechanics of the}} muscles that drive expansion or contraction of the chest wall during breathing. The diaphragm is the main inspiratory muscle. When its muscle fibers are activated in isolation, they shorten, the dome of the diaphragm descends, pleural pressure (P(pl)) falls, and abdominal pressure (P(ab)) rises. As a result, the ventral abdominal wall expands, but a large fraction of the rib cage contracts. Expansion of the rib cage during inspiration is produced by the external <b>intercostals</b> in the dorsal portion of the rostral interspaces, the intercartilaginous portion of the internal <b>intercostals</b> (the so-called parasternal <b>intercostals),</b> and, in humans, the scalenes. By elevating the ribs and causing an additional fall in P(pl), these muscles not only help the diaphragm expand the chest wall and the lung, but they also increase the load on the diaphragm and reduce the shortening of the diaphragmatic muscle fibers. The capacity of the diaphragm to generate pressure is therefore enhanced. In contrast, during expiratory efforts, activation of the abdominal muscles produces a rise in P(ab) that leads to a cranial displacement of the diaphragm into the pleural cavity and a rise in P(pl). Concomitant activation of the internal interosseous <b>intercostals</b> in the caudal interspaces and the triangularis sterni during such efforts contracts the rib cage and helps the abdominal muscles deflate the lung.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the action of}} the inspiratory <b>intercostals,</b> we studied the patterns of rib cage and abdominal motion during tidal breathing in eight dogs before and after bilateral phrenicotomy. Hooks screwed into the sternum and the ribs were used to monitor the anteroposterior and transverse diameters of the rib cage and the axial displacements of the sternum and the ribs. In all animals, we found that during tidal inspirations performed with the inspiratory <b>intercostals</b> alone, 1) the rib cage moved outward while the abdomen moved inward; 2) the rib cage was displaced near its relaxation curve (defined by a plot of its transverse vs. anteroposterior diameter) but expanded more in its transverse than in its anteroposterior dimension; and 3) the ribs in the midaxillary line moved cephalad, whereas the sternum was displaced caudally. Additional experiments performed on four dogs demonstrated that contraction of the parasternal <b>intercostals</b> was responsible for the inspiratory caudal displacement of the sternum. These findings indicate that in the dog, 1) the inspiratory <b>intercostals</b> act essentially on the lateral walls of the rib cage, and 2) those of the parasternal area produce a caudal displacement of the sternum. In addition, they suggest strongly that the axial displacement of the sternum constitutes an additional degree of freedom of motion of the rib cage and that contraction of the neck accessory muscles is mandatory for the sternum to be displaced in a cephalad direction during inspiration.

25|$|The {{diaphragm}} is {{the main}} muscle of respiration and functions in breathing. During inhalation, the diaphragm contracts and moves in the inferior direction, enlarging {{the volume of the}} thoracic cavity and reducing intra-thoracic pressure (the external <b>intercostal</b> muscles also participate in this enlargement), forcing the lungs to expand. In other words, the diaphragm's movement downwards creates a partial vacuum in the thoracic cavity, which forces the lungs to expand to fill the void, drawing air in the process.|$|E
25|$|As the {{diaphragm}} contracts, the rib cage is simultaneously enlarged by the ribs being pulled upwards by the <b>intercostal</b> muscles {{as shown in}} Fig.4.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present studies was to assess the {{functional}} coupling between the parasternal <b>intercostals</b> and the triangularis sterni (transversus thoracis) muscles during resting breathing, and we measured the electrical activity and the respiratory changes in length of these two muscles in 13 supine anesthetized dogs. The changes in muscle length were defined relative to their respective in situ relaxation length (Lr). During inspiration, the parasternal <b>intercostals</b> were active and shortened below Lr, causing the triangularis sterni to be passively stretched above Lr. Shortly after the cessation of parasternal contraction, the triangularis sterni became active and shortened below Lr, and in nine animals this active shortening was associated with a forcible distension of the parasternal <b>intercostals</b> above Lr. Deactivation of the triangularis sterni at end expiration caused both muscles to return to their respective Lr. This pattern was essentially unchanged after supplemental anesthesia and bilateral phrenicotomy.
