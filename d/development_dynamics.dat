The latter has big potential in energy and the Slovak Republic can provide high added value - {{we went through a}} similar development phase and we have expertise and technology.“ [...] For this reason Parízek usually brings with him a delegation of Slovak business people on his official visits abroad.

His studies are reported to have widened {{our understanding of the}} <b>development,</b> <b>dynamics</b> and disruption of natural ecosystems and assisted in developing scientific methodologies for their protection, management and conservation. He is credited with the compilation of comprehensive data on different ecosystems and he is known to have proposed new eco-management strategies and resource study protocols. His researches have been documented by way of 405 articles, ResearchGate, an online repository of scientific articles has listed 300 of them. Besides, he has published five books viz. Tropical Ecosystems: Ecology and Management, Grassland vegetation: its structure, function, utilization and management, Forests of Himalaya: Structure, Functioning, and Impact of Man, Research Methods in Plant Ecology. and Science and Rural Development in Mountains., Ecology, environmental Science and conservation (author1=J S Singh, author 2+S P Singh, author 3+ S R Gupta ( [...] publisher= S.

Plädoyer für Dissoziation" [...] (World Economic Order and Development Policy. Plea for Dissociation), Senghaas {{attempts}} to make visible the structural dependency of the periphery on the metropolises, or stated more simply, the dependence of the developing countries (or areas) on the political and economic power centers in the age of world economy. Senghaas sees a solution to the impediments to development, created externally (pressure of the industrial countries) and internally (interests of the power elite in keeping the existing societal structures), in a decoupling (not severance!) at times from the world market. In this decoupling phase, the concentration should be upon the development of the economic form of the developing countries, which should be the satisfaction of the local population, if possible exploiting local resources (with which Senghaas does not mean striving for economic self-sufficiency). With this way of looking at things, Senghaas also simultaneously rejected the idea prevalent at that time that simply integrating the Third World into the existing world economic order could solve the development problems of the Third World. As of the middle of the 1970s, Senghaas attempted to strengthen his theory by analysing the developing socialist countries of Albania, the People's Republic of China, North Korea and Cuba. For Senghaas, socialism did not represent a post-capitalist production system. Much more (independently of the intentions of the respective leader or regime), socialism could accomplish an economic development, which {{would not have been possible}} in that way under capitalistic conditions. In his analysis, Senghaas came to the conclusion that the development of states proceeded positively in the beginning, but then came increasingly to a standstill due to the absence of reforms, a more and more complex system of business and society and an increasingly inflexible political order (results in the middle of the 1980s). From the results of the analysis, several country monographs and an article on the status of socialism regarding historical development were created in cooperations with Frankfurt graduate students. Dieter Senghaas decisively left his mark on the discussion of theoretical development within international relations in Germany with his works about the possibilities of independent development processes in dependency of the given international conditions (economic and political).|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the {{knowledge}} dimensions grounding regional <b>development</b> <b>dynamics.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The paper first provides a knowledge-based interpretation of regional development and afterwards the knowledge assets categories at the basis of value creation dynamics at regional level are discussed. The aim is to define a conceptual framework addressing the knowledge assets categories affecting the <b>development</b> <b>dynamics</b> of regions and territories. To support these arguments, the paper integrates the conceptual framework with the analysis of a case study of an Italian region. The paper provides the case example of Basilicata region, which has planned and implemented policies aimed to activate and support regional strategic development by focusing on knowledge assets dimensions. The paper combines a deductive approach with an inductive one. The knowledge assets dimensions grounding regional <b>development</b> <b>dynamics</b> are identified through a review of the literature. Then, the conceptual framework is integrated by the analysis of a case study aimed to enrich the proposed conceptual arguments with empirical evidences. Findings – The paper highlights the strategic relevance of knowledge capital in sustaining and driving regional <b>development</b> <b>dynamics.</b> The knowledge assets dimensions grounding regional development are discussed, providing insights for both research and practice. Originality/value – This paper contributes to further develop the knowledge-based view of the regional <b>development</b> <b>dynamics.</b> The paper provides implications for future research and useful insights for policy making...|$|E

40|$|Clusters of {{cultural}} and creative industries are rather widespread in and surrounding inner cities. The <b>development</b> and <b>dynamics</b> of these clusters are objects of study of various conceptual approaches: some aim at their role and significance for urban development, others at their <b>development</b> and <b>dynamics</b> as such. These latter approaches focus primarily on producers or consumers {{of cultural}} or creative goods. By contrast, this paper explores {{the role of a}} particular type of secondary or ancillary activity - the business incubator - in the development of these clusters. The paper is explorative and draws no explicit conclusions. Nevertheless, the incubator appears to be an ancillary activity that contributes in various manners to sustainable cluster development, i. e. not only by their output of young, trained entrepreneurs in possession of up-to-date knowledge and skills, but also by means of, for instance, their buildings and social networks. </p...|$|R
