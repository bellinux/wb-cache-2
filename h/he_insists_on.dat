5|$|As {{the son of}} {{the filmmaker}} Rakesh, Roshan faced the media {{spotlight}} from a young age. Discussing nepotism in Bollywood, Shama Rana views him as one of several actors who managed film careers with the help of family relations in the industry. On the other hand, Roshan is acknowledged in the media {{as one of the most}} talented Indian actors of his generation, for his devotion to his work and for his ability to commit heavily to each role. <b>He</b> <b>insists</b> <b>on</b> learning any necessary skills and performing stunts himself, and is particularly known for his professionalism. The director Ashutosh Gowariker praised Roshan when he continued filming Mohenjo Daro despite several injuries and being in a troubled state of mind.

5|$|It is {{revealed}} that Leon's superior officer, Raccoon City police chief Brian Irons, had been bribed by Umbrella to hide {{evidence of the}} company's experiments in {{the outskirts of the}} city. He also concealed their development of the new G-virus, an agent capable of mutating a human into the ultimate bioweapon. Leon has multiple encounters with a Tyrant monster air-dropped into the Raccoon Police Department by Umbrella to seek the G-virus. Irons tries to murder Claire but is killed by a G-virus mutant in the police department. Thereupon, Claire and Sherry escape through the sewers and become separated. After splitting up with Leon, Ada comes upon Sherry and picks up a golden pendant the girl loses while running away. Further into the sewers, Ada reluctantly teams up with Leon again, after <b>he</b> <b>insists</b> <b>on</b> his duty to protect her. They encounter a middle-aged woman who fires at Ada, but Leon dives between them and takes a bullet himself. Ada ignores the unconscious Leon and follows the woman, who reveals herself to be Sherry's mother Annette and the wife of William Birkin, the Umbrella scientist who created the G-virus. In an attempt to protect his life's work from special agents sent by the Umbrella headquarters, he injected himself with the virus, which turned him into the malformed creature that is now chasing Sherry. Annette recognizes her daughter's pendant and attempts to take it from Ada. A fight ensues, during which Annette is thrown over a railing. Ada learns that the golden locket contains a sample of the G-virus, and later– taken over by her emotions– returns to Leon, tending to his bullet wound.|$|E

25|$|In addition, war {{narratives}} {{were transformed}} into literature by (among others) the publishing houses, which distorted the perception {{and treatment of}} captivity. Nicolas Beaupré cites the letter of one of Éditions Berger-Levrault’s directors in which <b>he</b> <b>insists</b> <b>on</b> giving a direction to the publication of war stories, more for vainglory than a depiction of events: “Currently we, {{more than any other}} publishing house, are editing, as much at Nancy as in Paris, with very restrained means. If we can hold on and publish only good publications on the war, the House will emerge from the conflict in more of a starring role than before”. Still, sales for war stories quickly dropped as popular demand shifted elsewhere.|$|E

[...] Bachchan, on his part, agreed to do the film without a script narration. Karan mentioned that he was initially scared to direct a star of the stature of Bachchan, but the latter [...] "soon became an actor instead of a superstar".|$|E

He eventually relents, but it is revealed that due to a mix-up Terry, not Mr. Khoo, is the suitable donor. Despite protests from his parents, <b>he</b> <b>insists</b> <b>on</b> undergoing the operation, which is a success. A grateful Mr. Liu offers to help Mr. Khoo's business with his proposal.

The [...] "greatest thing in the world," [...] then, is the individual's little win in the face of ostensibly mightier forces.|$|E
