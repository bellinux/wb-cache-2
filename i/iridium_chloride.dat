The most prominent fractions of iridium were retained in kidney and spleen; smaller amounts were found in lungs, liver and brain. Iridium brain levels were lower than those observed in other tissues but this finding can support the hypothesis of iridium capability to cross the blood brain barrier. The iridium kidney levels rose significantly with the administered dose. At the highest dose, important amounts of the metal were found in serum, urine and feces. Iridium was predominantly excreted via feces with a significant linear correlation with the ingest- ed dose, which is likely due to low intestinal absorption of the metal. However, at the higher doses iridium was also eliminated through urine. These findings may be useful to help in the understanding of the adverse health effects, particularly on the immune system, of iridium dispersed in the environment as well as in identifying appropriate biological indices of iridium exposure...|$|R

40|$|A {{product of}} the high {{temperature}} and pressure carbonylation of ruthenium pentafluoride is shown by X-ray crystallographic techniques to have a molecular structure based on a tetrameric unit, (Ru (CO) 3 F 2) 4, having bridging fluorine atoms. The crystal structure is disordered and {{a model for the}} disorder is proposed. The physical and chemical properties of the compound are discussed in relation to the known, dimeric dihalogenotricarbonyl- ruthenium compounds, Ru 2 (CO) 6 X 4. The fluorination of dodecacarbonyltriruthenium using fluorine or xenon difluoride, at room temperature in chlorofluorocarbon solvents, gives an involatile, moisture- sensitive solid. Spectroscopic, magnetic, and analytical evidence suggests a possible formulation Ru (CO) 3 F 3 for the solid. Polymeric and ionic structures for such a species are discussed. Fluorination of dodecacarbonyltriosmium, using xenon difluoride, in chlorofluorocarbon solvents gives an involatile, moisture-sensitive solid of composition Os(CO) 3 F 2. Mass and infrared spectroscopic and chemical evidence suggests a polymeric formulation for this compound, (Os(CO) 3 F 2) n. A fluorine-bridged polymeric structure is proposed for (Os(CO) 3 F 2) n. Both the product formulated as Ru (CO) 3 F 3 and (Os(CO) 3 F 2) n are soluble in anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. Dodecacarbonyltetrarhodium and hexadecacarbonylhexarhodium react with xenon difluoride to give similar moisture- sensitive solid products of uncertain composition. Chemical and spectroscopic evidence suggests that the product is not a single phase and that one component is possibly a carbonyl-bridged, polynuclear rhodium carbonyl fluoride species. A synthesis of dodecacarbonyltetrairidium in up to 50 % yield is reported. Two <b>iridium</b> carbonyl <b>chloride</b> species, (Ir (CO) 2 (H 2 O) Cl 2) 2. 2 H 2 O and (Ir (CO) 2 Cl 2) -, are reduced, by carbon monoxide at atmospheric pressure and room temperature in alcoholic solvents and in the presence of sodium bicarbonate or lithium acetate, to give Ir 4 (CO) 12. Dodecacarbonyltetrairidium reacts readily with chlorine, bromine, and iodine but not with xenon difluoride. The moisture-sensitive chlorination and bromination products react with triphenyl- phosphine to give the known, substituted Ir (III) carbonyl halides, IrX 3 (CO) (Ph 3 P) 2 and IrHX 2 (CO) (Ph 3 P) 2; (X = Cl,Br).

We report {{the synthesis of}} two sterically diverse ligands and how their backbones can influence reactivity and coordination geometries. Phosphinothiol ligand 2 -(diphenylphosphino) cyclohexanethiol (L 1 !!) has been successfully synthesised using commercially available cyclohexene sulphide and fully characterised. A second chiral bidentate phosphinothiolate ligand 9, 10 -ethanoanthracene- 2 -diphenylphosphino- 1 -ethanethiol, 9 - 10 -dihydro, (L 2 H) has been synthesised via a seven step process derived from anthracene. A series of phosphinothioether ligands have been synthesised using the phosphinothiolate LJLi and L 2 K precursors. The series includes thioether moieties containing benzyl (L*Bn, L 2 Bn), 1 -methyl naphthalene (Ll-MN, L 21 -MN) and 9 -methyl anthracene (L-MAN, L 29 -MAN). L/H reacts with divalent nickel and palladium to form complexes of general formula MCL 1) : (7, M=Ni), (8, M=Pd), M(L 1) C 1 2 (9. M=Ni) and MCLMCb (11, M=Pd). We also report {{the formation of a}} novel dimer complex using the well researched 2 -(diphenylphosphino) ethanethiol (dppet) ligand, M(dppet) Cl 2 (10, M=Pd). We report the first structural characterisation of a nickel phosphinothiolate bis-chelate and dimer complexes. L 2 H reacts with divalent palladium to produce a number of polymeric complexes M(L 2) 2 (12, M=Pd), M(L 2 S 02) 2 (13, M=Pd) M (L 2) C 1 2 (14, M=Pd) MCl 2 Pd(L 2) 2 M(H 20) Cl 2 2 (15, M=Pd) M (L 1) C 1 3 (16. M=Pd). Complexes are structurally analysed via their crystallographic data and compared. Complexation of phosphinothioether ligands using divalent nickel and palladium yield the following dihalide complexes M(L 1 Bn) Br 2 (17, M=Ni). (18, M=Pd), MCl/BiCh (19, M=Ni), (20, M=Pd), MOl-MNlo (21, M=Pd), M(1 -MNL 11 - MN) C 12 (22, M=Pd), M(L 19 -MAN) C 12 (23, M=Pd). The resulting complexes are structurally compared to similar complexes reported in the literature. We report a similar series of phosphinothioether ligands as previously described using the phosphinothiolate precursor L 2 K. Complexation of these ligands with divalent palladium resulted in the corresponding dichloride complexes Pd(L 2 Bn) Cl 2 (24), Pd(L 2 l-MN) Cl 2 (26) and Pd(L 29 -MAN) Cl 2 (28).

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} new techniques and new approaches for studying the kinetics and mechanisms of reactions which occur at the interface between two immiscible liquids. New approaches for studying the kinetics of transfer processes at the air/water interface are also described. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) is employed in the equilibrium perturbation (BP) mode for studying reversible transfer processes at liquid/liquid and air/water interfaces. In this application, an ultramicroelectrode (UME) located in an aqueous phase, at micro metre distances from the interface of interest, is employed to drive a transfer process, initially at equilibrium, {{in the direction of the}} aqueous phase by depleting the local aqueous concentration of a target species by electrolysis. The UME current flow depends on the transfer kinetics at the interface. The development of a submarine UME allows SECM to be conducted at the air/water interface, or at a liquid/liquid interface with the electrode in the more dense phase. The kinetics of the extraction/stripping reactions of aqueous copper (II) with an oxime ligand (Acorga PSO) in 1, 2 -dichloroethane (DCE) and heptane are first investigated. Subsequently, measurements of the kinetics of oxygen transfer across a condensed monolayer of l-octadecanol, as a function of surface area, demonstrate that the accessible free area of the interface primarily governs the rate of oxygen transfer. SECM double potential step chronoamperometry is developed to study irreversible transfer processes at interfaces. Theoretical modelling is applied and tested through experimental measurements on model interfaces. Subsequently, the rate of transfer of bromine from aqueous solutions to DCE and to air is shown to be above the upper limit measurable by the technique, however, a lower limit on the first order transfer rate constant ofO. S cm S-l is assigned. A new technique, termed microelectrochemical measurements at expanding droplets (MEMED) is developed for studying spontaneous reactions at liquid/liquid interfaces. In MEMED, the two liquids are contacted by flowing one (feeder) through a capillary submerged in the second (receptor), resulting in the growth of drops at the capillary tip. The interfacial reaction generates a product or reactant concentration profile, which extends into the receptor phase. This is probed directly using a UME positioned opposite the capillary in the solution, operated in either a potentiometric or an amperometric mode, as a local concentration probe. A numerical model for mass transport in this configuration is developed, and the technique and model are assessed by measuring both bromine transfer from aqueous sulfuric acid solutions to drops of DCE, and bimolecular electron transfer between <b>iridium</b> (IV) <b>chloride</b> in the aqueous solution and ferrocene in the organic phase, which exhibit transport-controlled transfer rates under the conditions employed. The MEMED technique is applied to measure the kinetics of the hydrolysis of triphenylmethyl chloride (TPMCl), at the DCE/water interface, through potentiometric measurement of the chloride ion concentration profile. The reaction is shown to be first-order in TPMCI, occurring interfacially, with a rate constant of 6. 5 x 10 - 5 cm s". Subsequently, the oxidation of methylanisole (MA) (feeder) by aqueous solutions of cerium (IV) (Ce(IV» (receptor), is probed. Under the conditions of this study, the reaction at the interface dominates, with a negligible contribution from the aqueous phase reaction between dissolved MA and Ce(IV) ...|$|R
40|$|Please {{refer to}} {{dissertation}} for diagrams. Part I describes the silicon-hydrogen bond activation (SiHA) of silanes with both electron-deficient <b>iridium</b> porphyrin carbonyl <b>chloride</b> (Ir(ttp) Cl(CO)) and electron-rich iridium porphyrin methyl (Ir(ttp) Me) to give iridium(III) porphyrin silyls (Ir(ttp) SiR 3). Firstly, Ir(ttp) SiR 3 were synthesized in moderate to good yields conveniently from {{the reactions of}} Ir(ttp) Cl(CO) and Ir(ttp) Me with silanes, via SiHA in solvent-free conditions and non-polar solvents at 200 °C. Base facilitated the SiHA reaction even at lower temperature of 140 °C. Specifically, K 3 PO 4 accelerated the SiHA with Ir(ttp) Cl(CO), while KOAc promoted the SiHA by Ir(ttp) Me. Mechanistic experiments suggest that Ir(ttp) Cl(CO) initially forms iridium porphyin cation (Ir(ttp) +), which then reacts with silanes likely via heterolysis to give iridium porphyrin hydride (Ir(ttp) H). Ir(ttp) H further reacts with silanes to yield Ir(ttp) SiR 3. On the other hand, Ir(ttp) Me and Ir(ttp) SiR 3 undergo either oxidative addition (OA) or sigma-bond metathesis (SBM) to form the products. In the presence of base, a penta-coordinated silicon hydride species likely forms and reacts with Ir(ttp) Me to form iridium porphyrin anion (Ir(ttp) -) that can further react with silane to yield Ir(ttp) H after protonation. Ir(ttp) H finally reacts with excess silane to give Ir(ttp) SiR 3. *Part II describes successful base promoted aromatic carbon-fluorine (C-F) and carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond activation of fluorobenzenes in neat conditions to give the corresponding iridium(III) porphyrin aryls (Ir(ttp) Ar) at 200 °C in up to 95 % yield. Mechanistic studies suggested that Ir(ttp) SiEt 3 is firstly converted to Ir(ttp) - {{in the presence of}} KOH. Ir(ttp) - cleaves the aromatic C-F bond via an S NAr process. As the reaction proceeds, a hydroxide anion can coordinate to the iridium center of Ir(ttp) Ar to form an iridium porphyrin trans aryl hydroxyl anion (trans-[ArIr(ttp) OH]-). In the presence of water, trans-[ArIr(ttp) OH]- can give Ir(ttp) OH and ArH. Ir(ttp) OH then undergoes aromatic C-H bond activation reaction to give Ir(ttp) Ar'. Furthermore, the aromatic C-F bond activation products were found as the kinetic products, and aromatic C-H bond activation products were the thermodynamic ones. *Part III describes the successful C(C=O) -C(alpha) bond activation of acetophenones by high-valent iridium porphyrin complexes (Ir(ttp) X, X = Cl(CO), (BF 4) (CO), Me) in solvent-free conditions at 200 °C to give the corresponding iridium porphyrin benzoyls (Ir(ttp) COAr) in up to 92 % yield. Mechanistic studies suggest that Ir(ttp) X reacts with acetophenones to give alpha-CHA product as the primary product, which can re-convert back to the active intermediate Ir(ttp) OH or Ir(ttp) H in the presence of water formed from the concurrent iridium-catalyzed aldol condensation of acetophenones. Then Ir(ttp) OH cleaves the aromatic C-H bonds to produce the aromatic CHA products, which are more thermally stable than the alpha-CHA product. Both Ir(ttp) H and Ir(ttp) OH were the possible intermediates to cleave the C(C=O) -C(alpha) bond to give thermodynamic products of Ir(ttp) COAr. On the other hand, only Ir(ttp) (BF 4) (CO) can react with the aliphatic ketones, likely due to the stronger Lewis acidity and the HBF 4 generated in catalyzing the aldol condensation of aliphatic ketones to facilitate the formation of Ir(ttp) OH and Ir(ttp) H. *The objectives of the research focus on the bond activation chemistry by iridium porphyrin complexes with three organic substrates, (1) hydrosilanes (HSiR 3), (2) fluorobenzenes (C 6 HnF 6 -n, n = 0 [...] 6), and (3) aromatic or aliphatic ketones (RCOR, R = alkyl or aryl).

The molecule lies across an inversion center. Each octahedron can be envisioned as being comprised of four chloride ligands in the equatorial plane with methanol ligands in the axial positions.

40|$|Hydrogen is {{expected}} {{to play an important}} role as a crosslinking technology between power generation on one hand and transport and industry on the other hand. It can directly replace fossil fuels in transport and industry when produced by water electrolysis renewable energies such as solar or wind, which are converted with low efficiencies. The relevant technologies are either the mature alkaline electrolysis or the newer proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. For PEM electrolysis in particular, key components that determine the stack cost are the titanium-based contact elements, such as the bipolar plates (BPP) and the current collectors (CC), and the high iridium loading of electrocatalyst for the OER in state of art membrane electrode assemblies (MEA). However, the cost structure depends on the specific design of the electrolyser. This paper will discuss strategies for cost reduction by synthesizing unsupported and supported IrOx and IrRuOx electrocatalyst with the aim of lowering the high loading. Our synthesis procedure consists of producing nano-sized iridium particles by reducing <b>iridium</b> <b>chloride</b> (IrCl 3) with conventional sodium borohydride at room temperature and in water-free environment. This concept can also be applied to supported and alloy electrocatalysts. The supports need to be highly stable and exhibit sufficient electronic conductivity. The enhancement of activity achieved with improved electrocatalyst reaches a factor of about 15 with respect to the best commercially available electrocatalyst. Additionally, the cost reduction achieved by a titanium coating for stainless steel BPPs or CCs for PEM electrolysis will be discussed. We use vacuum plasma spraying (VPS) to coat either dense coatings for corrosion protection of stainless steel components or build up titanium diffusion layers with defined porosity as contact elements for the MEA. The conductivity of the titanium coating can be improved by well-known Pt or Au additions; however, we have also developed promising non-noble conductivity enhancement elements. Furthermore, the VPS coating and production procedure is adaptable to large-scale industrial production...|$|E
