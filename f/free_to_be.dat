5|$|Grammar is {{the study}} of how {{meaningful}} elements called morphemes within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be free or bound. If they are <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> moved around within an utterance, they are usually called words, and if they are bound to other words or morphemes, they are called affixes. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The rules for the internal structure of words are called morphology. The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are called syntax.|$|E

25|$|Discussing ethical issues, Ruse {{distinguishes between}} {{involuntary}} inclination and willful behavior, arguing that while a homosexual orientation is morally blameless, {{this is not}} necessarily true of homosexual behavior. Ruse finds no justification for homosexual or heterosexual promiscuity, but nevertheless maintains on utilitarian grounds that people should be <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> promiscuous. He criticizes ethical arguments that appeal to scientific claims about the naturalness or unnaturalness of homosexuality, for example the views of the Greek philosopher Plato, according to whom homosexual behavior did not occur in animals. Ruse finds this claim to be mistaken, and dismisses the idea that homosexuality is unnatural. Ruse argues that both neo-Kantian and utilitarian theories of the just state must affirm the moral worth of homosexual relationships and support equal rights for homosexuals and heterosexuals.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{parties of}} Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats were {{in favour of}} the treaty, but the other government party, the Green Party, was divided on the issue. At a special convention on 19 January 2008, {{the leadership of the}} Green Party failed to secure a two-thirds majority required to make support for the referendum official party policy. The result of the vote was 63% in favour. As a result, the Green Party itself did not participate in the referendum debate, although individual members were <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> involved in whatever side they chose; all Green Party members of the Oireachtas supported the Treaty. The main opposition parties of Fine Gael and the Labour Party were also in favour. Only one party represented in the Oireachtas, Sinn Féin, was opposed to the treaty, while minor parties opposed to it included the Socialist Party, the Workers' Party and the Socialist Workers Party. Independent TD's Tony Gregory and Finian McGrath, Independent MEP Kathy Sinnott, and Independent members of the Seanad from the universities David Norris, Shane Ross and Rónán Mullen advocated a No vote as well.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{commented on}} the {{differences}} between Free and Office of Strategic Influence. Rosenberg described Free as [...] "heavier, darker, more experimental {{and a lot more}} consistent" [...] than the first album. Stewart Mason of Allmusic described the album as [...] "downright commercial in a way that none of the duo's previous projects have been". He regarded the album as less like the [...] "standard-issue epic metal" [...] of the first album and more like [...] "Evanescence's gothy metal-pop crossed with late-era Radiohead's fondness for electronic interference". He considered the songwriting as [...] "catchy enough that it's not unthinkable that unadventurous rock radio programmers could take a shine to the title track or 'Go'", although noted that [...] "Fates Warning and Dream Theater fans might be less impressed". Rosenberg considers Free as musically [...] "a more progressive version of Nine Inch Nails. Instead of creating their darkness with angst and depression, OSI creates their darkness with sheer indifference." [...] Begrand compared the album to Head Control System, [...] "in that it tends to stray from the typical metal template in an attempt at something a little more electronic influenced". Although not considering <b>Free</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> as [...] "enthralling" [...] as Head Control System, he noted that the album [...] "still has its moments".|$|E

They are soon divorced, and she moves on with Phillip [...] "Chance" [...] Chancellor IV (John Driscoll), Jill's grandson through Phillip Chancellor III (Thom Bierdz).

2500|$|In this sense, {{some have}} read Nietzsche as an anti-political thinker.

In [...] "Nietzsche and Fascists," [...] he argued against such instrumentalization, by the left or the right, declaring that Nietzsche's aim was to by-pass the short timespan of modern politics, and its inherent lies and simplifications, for a greater historical timespan.|$|E
