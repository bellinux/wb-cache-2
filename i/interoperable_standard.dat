40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{a number}} of issues currently facing the access, delivery and use of geospatial information (GI) via the World Wide Web (WWW, Web). Taking a practical, rather than conceptual approach, particular focus has been placed on the need for the identification and application of existing geospatial <b>interoperable</b> <b>standards</b> in addressing some of these issues. Therefore a range of solutions have been developed around the provision of land information and administration within Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. As widely as possible existing geospatial <b>interoperable</b> <b>standards,</b> protocols and technologies have been used to develop solutions to the problems discussed in this paper. The research also highlights some of the problems encountered in implementing current geospatial standards. Background and Motivation There are {{a number of}} GIS used in organisations to manage, maintain and distribute their data.

50|$|Magnetic tape {{data storage}} {{has been used}} for over 50 years, but {{typically}} did not hold file metadata in a form easy to access or modify independent of the file content data. Often external databases were used to maintain file metadata (file names, timestamps, directory hierarchy) to hold this data but these external databases were generally not designed for interoperability and tapes might or might not contain an index of their content. In Unix-like systems, there is the tar <b>interoperable</b> <b>standard,</b> but this is not well-suited to allow modification of file metadata independent of modifying file content data - and does not maintain a central index of files nor provide a filesystem interface or characteristics.|$|E

40|$|The current {{proliferation}} of the World Wide Web (WWW) {{and the growing}} popularity of the Java language[1] for programming such environments has fueled a need for Web browsers to provide access to the variety of information sources and services now available on the Internet.

In this paper, we present the tools we have developed that provide powerful mechanisms for accessing any service based upon the interoperable CORBA standards from the popular WWW browsers.

40|$|A {{use case}} {{involving}} integrating results from search engines illustrates how the meta-metadata language facilitates interoperable metadata semantics. Formal semantics {{can be hard}} to obtain directly. For example, search engines may only present results through web pages; even if they do provide web services, they don’t provide them according to a mutually <b>interoperable</b> <b>standard.</b> We show how to use the open source meta-metadata language to define a common base class for search results, and how to extend the base class to create polymorphic variants that include engine-specific fields. We develop wrappers to extract data from HTML search results from engines including Google, Bing, Delicious, and Slashdot. We write a short meta-search program for integratingthesearch results, reranking them, and providing formatted HTML output. This provides an extensible formal and functional semantics for search. Meta-metadata also directly enables representing the same integrated search results as XML or JSON. This research can profoundly transform the derivation and representation of interoperable metadata semantics from a multitude of heterogeneous wild web sources...|$|E

40|$|Over recent years, network-based attacks {{evolved to}} the top {{concerns}} responsible for network infrastructure and service outages. To counteract such attacks, an approach is to move mitigation from the target network to the networks of Internet Service Providers (ISP).

However, exchanging threat information is currently done on an ad-hoc basis via email or telephone, and there is still no <b>interoperable</b> <b>standard</b> to exchange threat information among trusted partners.
