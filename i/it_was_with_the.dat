The book was written solely for men, as women did not normally ice skate in the late 18th century. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> publication of this manual that ice skating split into its two main disciplines, speed skating and figure skating.|$|E

They decided to reinvestigate the motion of γ Draconis with a telescope constructed by George Graham (1675–1751), a celebrated instrument-maker.

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Expos that Martínez {{developed}} {{into one of}} the top pitchers in baseball. Despite possessing a live fastball, he had difficulty maintaining control. It was during a bullpen session that manager Felipe Alou encouraged him to modify his primary grip on the fastball from two fingers to four. The transformation was dramatic: the fastball − already among the fastest in the game − now was thrown with near-impeccable control and break that routinely overwhelmed hitters. On April 13, 1994, Martínez took a perfect game through 7 innings until throwing a brushback pitch at Reggie Sanders that led Sanders to immediately charge the mound, starting a bench-clearing brawl. Martínez ended up with a no-decision in the game, which the Expos eventually won 3–2.|$|E
