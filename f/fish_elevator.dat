50|$|A <b>fish</b> <b>elevator</b> or fish lift, as {{its name}} implies, breaks with the ladder design by {{providing}} a sort of elevator to carry fish over a barrier. It is well suited to tall barriers. With a <b>fish</b> <b>elevator,</b> fish swim into a collection area {{at the base of}} the obstruction. When enough fish accumulate in the collection area, they are nudged into a hopper that carries them into a flume that empties into the river above the barrier.|$|E

40|$|The author {{outlines}} in {{this paper}} the functional features and design parameters used for the different fish facilities (Denil and pool <b>fish</b> passes, <b>fish</b> <b>elevators).</b> Emphasis {{is placed on the}} importance of conceiving, as far as possible, self-cleaning facilities which do not require any control with upstream or downstream water level fluctuations. Based on statistical analysis of experiments on fish transit through hydraulic turbines, models for predicting potential fish mortalities are formulated for FRANCIS and KAPLAN runners. Most recent experiments on downstream migration problems concern the use of surface gates to bypass juveniles around powerhouse intakes. Lights have been tested to try to improve the efficiency of such bypasses...|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} species of {{anadromous}} and catadromous fish, including brook trout, winter flounder, blueback herring, alewife, rainbow trout, large brown trout, American shad (Alosa sapidissima), hickory shad, smallmouth bass, Atlantic sturgeon, striped bass (Morone saxatilis), carp, catfish, American eel, sea lamprey, and endangered shortnose sturgeon and dwarf wedgemussels. Additionally, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service has repopulated the river with another species of migratory fish, the Atlantic salmon, which for more than 200 years had been extinct from the river due to damming. Several fish ladders and <b>fish</b> <b>elevators</b> have been built to allow fish to resume their natural migration upriver each spring.|$|R

40|$|Blood {{lactic acid}} levels and {{immediate}} fishlift induced mortality were monitored in 1974 and 1975 {{to determine the}} stress incurred by American shad (Alosa sapidissima) in a <b>fish</b> <b>elevator</b> system, and to evaluate improvements made to this system. In 1974 mean blood lactic acid levels of shad increased three-fold during passage through the system. By 1975, improvements were complete, and mean lactic acid levels did not significantly increase during passage. Females had significantly higher levels in both years. Immediate fishlift mortality was 3. 89 % and 1, 40 % of all shad lifted in 1974 and 1975 respectively. The lower lactic acid levels and fishlift mortality in 1975 appeared to result from less handling of shad in the improved fishlift...|$|E
40|$|None supplied. From introduction: The {{purpose of}} this series of reports is to provide {{guidelines}} and engineering design parameters for fish passage facilities required to pass substantial numbers of anadromous fish over dams on the Merrimack River Basin. American shad and Atlantic salmon are the main species considered for restoration. Upstream migrant facilities considered for use at the various dams on the Merrimack River Basin include fishways, atmospheric <b>fish</b> locks, <b>fish</b> <b>elevators,</b> and barrier dams. The size, type, and location of fish passage facilities proposed in this report are for guideline purposes only. Those facilities used in the final design {{will be based on}} detailed engineering and cost studies made by the respective dam owners and their design engineers working in cooperation with the Technical Committee for Fisheries Management of the Merrimack River Basin...|$|R
40|$|Over 450 dams {{have been}} {{constructed}} in the upper Paraná River basin in Brazil during the past 40 years. River regulation by these dams is considered a primary factor in the reduction of fish diversity and depletion of migratory species. In contrast to the upper Paraná Basin, only two large dams (both with upstream fish passage) {{have been constructed}} in the lower La Plata River basin. Fishery managers in the lower basin are concerned that existing and planned dams will further deplete populations of migratory fish species that constitute important recreational and commercial fisheries as {{has occurred in the}} upper basin. We assessed the sustainability of fisheries in the lower basin in the face of increased river regulation by using literature information to describe the efficiency of the fish passage systems used to mitigate river regulation impacts on fisheries. Our analysis shows that fish passage systems at both lower basin dams, Yacyreta and Salto Grande, fail to transfer sufficient numbers of upstream migrants to sustain populations of migratory species. Fish passage efficiency of target species in the <b>fish</b> <b>elevators</b> at Yacyreta is less than 2 %. Fish diversity in the <b>fish</b> <b>elevators</b> is low because about 85 % of the fish belong to only three non-migratory species (Pimelodus maculatus, Oxydoras kneri and Rhinodoras dorbignyi). Large migratory species targeted for passage rarely comprise even 5 % of the fish number in the passage system. The two Borland locks at Salto Grande Dam cannot dependably pass large numbers of migratory species because passage efficiency is dependent upon interactions of powerhouse and spillway operation with tailrace elevations. Most species in the Borland system were either a small catfish (Parapimelodus valenciennis) or a engraulid (Lycengraulis grossidens). Again, the targeted migratory species were not abundant in the passage system. We conclude that existing fish passage technology in the lower basin is inadequate and that improved fish passage designs are required to conserve migratory species. These designs must be based on integrated information from geomorphology (habitat), natural fish behavior, fish swimming capabilities, and detailed population studies...|$|R

Mais de 450 barragens foram construídas no alto rio Paraná, Brasil, nos últimos 40 anos. A regulação dos rios por barragens é considerada um dos fatores primários de redução da diversidade de peixes e depleção de espécies migratórias. Em contraste, somente duas grandes barragens foram construídas nos trechos mais inferiores da bacia do rio da Prata. No momento, há uma grande preocupação acerca do impacto dos represamentos sobre espécies que se constituem a base da pesca comercial e esportiva na bacia. Este artigo aborda o desempenho das passagens de peixes das barragens de Yacyreta e Salto Grande, monstrando que as mesmas falham na transferência de grandes quantidades de espécies migratórias para os trechos a montante. A barragem de Yacyreta tem dois elevadores com problemas importantes de projeto. Como resultado, a eficiência na passagem das espécies-alvo é menor do que 2 %. A diversidade das espécies transferidas é baixa, uma vez que 85 % dos espécimes dominantes nos elevadores foram representadas por uma espécie de Pimelodidae (Pimelodus maculatus) e duas de Doradidae (Oxydoras kneri e Rhinodoras dorbignyi). A passagem de grandes espécies alvo migratórias raramente compreende até 5 % do número de peixes no sistema de passagem. A barragem de Salto Grande tem duas passagens do tipo eclusas de Borland linstaladas, cuja performance varia consideravelmente dependendo da operação da casa de força e dos vertedouros, bem como da elevação de nível no canal de fuga. A maioria dos espécimes que passam pertencem a uma pequena espécie de Pimelodidae (Parapimelodus valenciennis) e a uma espécie de Engraulidae (Lycengraulis grossidens). Um novo direcionamento no desenho de passagens de peixes é necessário para a preservação das espécies migratórias em rios Sul Americanos. Informações integradas de geomorfologia (habitat), atratores de natureza hidrodinâmica detectável pelos peixes para selecionar as rotas de migração ascendentes e descendentes, capacidade natatória dos peixes e estudos detalhados de populações são necessárias...|$|R
40|$|Lake {{sturgeon}} {{have been}} identified as a species of concern in the Great Lakes and their tributaries. As a result, the need for upstream and downstream fish passage at existing hydroelectric facilities has been identified as a measure to reduce habitat fragmentation and restore access to spawning and rearing habitat. The Menominee River has been identified as a key river in restoring lake sturgeon habitat. The Menominee River forms the border between northeaster Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The Menominee River is formed at the confluence of the Brule and Michigamme rivers and flows in the southerly direction for 118 miles before joining the waters of Green Bay. The Menominee/Park Mill Hydroelectric Complex consists of the Park Mill Dam and the Menominee Dam which are the first two barriers to upstream passage on the Menominee River. Design of the fish passage facilities at these projects is underway and Kleinschmidt Associates has been retained to perform the final design of Phase II of the project, a new state-of-the-art <b>fish</b> <b>elevator</b> with a trap and transport facility. The new lift will be located in an unused turbine bay and will lift fish from the tailrace of the Menominee project into a sorting tank located {{on the first floor of}} the powerhouse. Fish will be sorted by biologists from the state and federal fishery resource agencies to remove invasive species such as sea lamprey, or held for screening and collection of sturgeon gametes. The desired fish will then be transported upstream of the Park Mill project. This presentation will focus on the conceptual design process, agency negotiations, the final design of the new <b>fish</b> <b>elevator,</b> and will discuss the layout of the new trap and transport facility...|$|E
40|$|None supplied. Introduction: In {{order for}} adult American shad {{to reach the}} Holyoke Pool {{spawning}} grounds in the upper Connecticut River, they must first be lifted over Holyoke Dam. Spillway and tailrace fish elevators have been constructed at Holyoke Dam for this purpose. The spillway lift {{is located at the}} base of the dam alongside the powerhouse for the Hadley Falls Station Unit No. 1 Hydroelectric Station. The tailrace elevator entrance is located alongside Hadley Falls Station. For this reason, fish seeking passage upriver have access to only one elevator at a time, depending on their course of travel, the tailrace or mainstream river route. The fish elevators at Holyoke Dam have lifted approximately 380, 000 American shad over the dam in each of the last two years (Krska and Kynard, 1982). While the spillway <b>fish</b> <b>elevator</b> lifts approximately 88...|$|E
40|$|Before flow {{patterns}} were modified at an Ice Harbor style fish ladder in the Connecticut River, counts of American shad (Alosa sapidissima) successfully negotiating the entire Turners Falls, Massachusetts powerhouse fishway were only 687 in 1980 and 219 in 1981, compared with 367, 000 and 377, 000 {{for the same}} years at Holyoke, a mechanical elevator 36 miles downstream. Before the 1983 run, a zigzag flow pattern was established and ikncluded a change from plunging to streaming flow over the weir crests. American shad passage in 1983 was 26, 697, of 528, 000 that passed the downstream <b>fish</b> <b>elevator.</b> Peak daily passage was 4, 540 and the maximum hourly rate was 780. A second Ice Harbor style ladder without flow modifications passed only 263 shad during the 1983 season, but passed 4, 563 in 1984 following similar changes...|$|E
40|$|The American Fisheries Society herein {{provides}} {{a list of}} depleted Pacific salmon, steelhead, and sea-run cutthroat stocks from California, Oregon, Idaho, and Washington, to accompany the list of rare inland fishes reported by Williams et al. (1989). The list includes 214 native naturally-spawning stocks: 101 {{at high risk of}} extinction, 58 at moderate risk of extinction, 54 of special concern, and one classified as threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and as endangered by the state of California. The decline in native salmon, steelhead, and sea-run cutthroat populations has resulted from habitat loss and damage, and inadequate passage and flows caused by hydropower, agriculture, logging, and other developments; overfishing, primarily of weaker stocks in mixed-stock fisheries; and negative interactions with other fishes, including nonnative hatchery salmon and steelhead. While some attempts at remedying these threats have been made, they have not been enough to prevent the broad decline of stocks along the West Coast. A new paradigm that advances habitat restoration and ecosystem function rather than hatchery production is needed for many of these stocks to survive and prosper into the next century. That part of the industry dependent on the Columbia River salmon run has expressed alarm at the possibility of disas-trous effects upon the fish through the erection of the tre-mendous dams at Bonneville and the Grand Coulee [...] Aside from the <b>fish</b> ladders and <b>elevators</b> contemplated, there is a program for artificial propagation set up which may be put into effect if the fish-passing devices fail to meet expec-tations. No possibilities, either biological or engineering, have been overlooked in devising a means to assure perpetuation of the Columbia River salmon...|$|R
