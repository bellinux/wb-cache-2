500|$|The pygmy slow loris can {{conceive}} by 18 {{months and}} {{give birth to}} its first offspring by two years of age. Studbook records show that the youngest male to sire offspring was around 18 months of age, and the youngest female conceived at 16 months. <b>Gestation</b> <b>length</b> is 184–200 days, and the lactation period lasts 123–146 days. Offspring are weaned at about 24 weeks of age. The pygmy slow loris is monoestrous, experiencing a single four- to five-day period of reproductive activity between late July and early October in captivity, with births occurring from early February to mid-March. As a result, opportunities for mating are rare, and females rely heavily on scent to assess mate quality. Females show a strong preference for familiar-smelling males over novel-smelling males. Research {{on the process of}} sexual selection in primates suggests that the exclusive presence of one male's scent in the area is a reliable cue that he is capable of defending the area and/or preventing rival males from marking. Pygmy slow lorises usually have a litter size of one or two; separate studies have reported frequencies of twinning as either 50% or 100% of births. Data collected from a seven-year captive breeding program indicates that they have a skewed birth sex ratio of 1 female to 1.68 males. Because they must divide time equally between offspring, mothers of twins spend less time engaging in social grooming and play with their young, which may lead to a lower infant survival rate. Mothers will [...] "park" [...] their young at one week of age while foraging, and the young begin following their mothers at about two weeks. The life span of the pygmy slow loris is about 20 years.|$|E

5000|$|Given {{that these}} <b>gestation</b> <b>lengths</b> are only {{estimates}} of an average, {{it is helpful}} to consider gestation time as a range of dates rather than as a single [...] "due date". The median is merely a guideline for the day at which half of all births occur earlier, and half of all births occur later. Births rarely occur on a due date, but they are clustered around due dates. For instance, a standard deviation of 13 days means that 90% of babies will be born within three weeks of their EDD, and 21% will be born within three days of it. Only 4% of births will occur on the EDD, but this is similar to most other days around the EDD; each day within a week of the EDD has a 3 to 4% probability of being the day that birth will occur. However, any given day two weeks away from the EDD has a less than 2% chance of being the day that birth will occur. If gestational age has been determined by ultrasound, it is typically accurate within seven days. This means that fewer than 5 percent of births occur on the day of being 40 weeks of gestational age; 50 percent of births are within a week of this duration, and about 80 percent are within 2 weeks.|$|R

50|$|For bats, energy {{demands are}} {{particularly}} high during pregnancy or lactation. One way many bats {{are able to}} save energy is {{through the use of}} torpor, which is a controlled, substantial drop in metabolic rate and body temperature (metabolism). In addition to hibernation (prolonged torpor) during winter, temperate zone bats, such as Histiotus, often become torpid during periods of cold weather in summer (daily torpor) to save energy. By reducing metabolic rate, torpor prolongs <b>gestation</b> <b>length</b> and impairs lactation. This results in late births and slow juvenile growth rates. This reduces the probability for juveniles to survive their first winter, because not enough time has passed to store proper amounts of fat prior to hibernation. This is why females of most temperate zone bats, such as Histiotus, form maternity colonies during summer to communally raise pups. These colonies allow individuals to reduce heat loss by forming a cluster and therefore by their behavior they are able to improve insulation and this results in the conservation of energy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The income-capital {{breeding}} {{model was}} developed to explain birth seasonality and reproductive strategies in female animals {{in relation to the}} abundance of food energy in the environment. An income breeder uses currently available energy and acts so as to maximize either maternal survival or weanling survival, depending on the relationship between timing of births and abundance of food energy. A capital breeder stores energy reserves for future reproductive use. Here we examined energetic influences on reproductive seasonality in a population of female white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus) living in a seasonal dry forest in Costa Rica. Our objectives were to determine: 1) the degree of fruiting seasonality in capuchin food trees and 2) the temporal relationship between capuchin births/ conceptions and fruit abundance. Our sample included 25 yr of birth data (N= 100 births), 4 yr of capuchin fruit tree phenology data, and 18 mo of ovarian hormone data, which we used to calculate <b>gestation</b> <b>lengths</b> and estimate conception dates. Using circular statistics, we found that the mean peak in fruit abundance occurs in June, and that this population of capuchins reproduces seasonally, with 44 % of births occurring within a 3 -mo period (May to July, mean month=May). We propose that white-faced capuchins can be generally classified as income breeders that maximize maternal survival instead of weanling survival and that they time infant births such that the most energy expensive period of reproduction, mid-to-late lactation, occurs during the mean peak in fruit abundance...|$|R

50|$|Though New Zealand lacked its own native {{population}} of deer, European settlers had introduced a numerous {{number of species}} of deer into the land {{for the use of}} farming and hunting. Some of these deer species had crossbred in the wild, creating hybrids, which in turn were then utilized in deer farms based on their apparent genetic improvements. Alongside this discovery, deer farms began the practice of inciting hybridization in order to encourage genetic advancement. This includes a hybrid between Père David's deer and Red deer. These F1 hybrids are unique for several reasons. To begin with, both male and female offspring of this hybrid remain fertile, a rare prospect especially for species that have such a genetic distance. Both species differ in seasonal behaviors, <b>gestation</b> <b>length,</b> behavioral traits, morphology, maturity size, and disease resistance. Père David's deer is also unique in that its antlers are unlike any other deer in the world. However, due to having different seasonal behavior each species would enter their mating season at different intervals, thus preventing natural mating from occurring. In response, artificial insemination was employed on Red deer hinds with the semen from Père David's deer. These F1 hybrids did not share similar mating seasons with Père David's deer and as such were able to successfully mate with other red deer naturally. Three F1 hybrid stags successfully mated naturally in a period from 1989 to 1991 with 144 hinds and semen had been used to artificially inseminate 114 other Red deer hinds producing over 300 backcross hybrids.|$|E

Moreover, in CCR 2 -deficient mice, this labor-associated increase in Itgam and Emr 1 was not seen, consistent with the monocyte-trafficking defects that exist in these animals.
