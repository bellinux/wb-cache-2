Once the investigations are complete, {{the family will}} be told to attend a coroner's inquiry at the Subordinate Courts. Only after that will they be able to claim the body.|$|E
5|$|Availability of {{substitute}} goods: The {{more and}} closer the substitutes available, {{the higher the}} elasticity is likely to be, as people can easily switch from one good to another <b>if</b> <b>an</b> even minor price change is made; There is a strong substitution effect.

5|$|Because each {{configuration}} {{has only}} a bounded number of predecessors, the evolution of Rule 90 preserves the entropy of any configuration.

It is also important to closely monitor fluids and electrolytes.|$|E
5|$|<b>If</b> <b>an</b> {{employee}} {{does make}} such a disclosure, Section 2 inserts a new Section 47B, providing that the employee shall suffer no detriment in their employment as a result. This includes both negative actions {{and the absence of}} action, and as such covers discipline, dismissal, or failing to gain a pay rise or access to facilities which would otherwise have been provided. <b>If</b> <b>an</b> employee does suffer a detriment, he is permitted to make a complaint before an employment tribunal under Section 3. In front of an employment tribunal, the law is amended in Sections 4 and 5 to provide compensation, and to reverse the burden of proof; <b>if</b> <b>an</b> employee has been dismissed for making a protected disclosure, this dismissal is automatically considered unfair. Similarly, under Section 6, an employee cannot be given priority when discussing redundancies simply because he made such a disclosure. These sections take into account Section 7, which notes that there is no requirement of age or length of employment before they come into effect.|$|E
