Samples were assessed {{in relation to}} a wide range of <b>industrial</b> <b>pollutants,</b> <b>including</b> metals, PAHs, PCBs, PBDEs and HBCDs. The data generated indicated that levels of pollutants were generally low and below commonly applied sediment quality guidelines (SQGs). However, naturally high background concentrations of certain metals present in sediment from the region may prohibit the direct assessment against some of the routinely applied SQGs.

40|$|The Saginaw River is {{contaminated}} {{with a number}} of <b>industrial</b> <b>pollutants</b> <b>including</b> polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Understanding of the risk posed by PCBs in the aquatic system requires measurement of the dissolved, bioavailable levels of PCBs. In this study, three means of assessing bioavailability were compared: sediments, caged fish, and semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs). Caged channel catfish and SPMDs were placed in the river for one month at five sites where sediments were also sampled. PCBs were analyzed by congener specific methods to determine PCB concentrations and patterns. Total PCB concentrations ranged 33 - 277 ng/g in sediments, 46 - 290 ng/g in caged fish, and 77 - 792 ng/g in SPMDs. SPMD and sediments provide complementary PCB information: sediments reflecting long term accumulation while SPMDs indicate what was present in the water at the site during the sampling period. Differences in PCB patterns in caged fish and SPMDs are due to lower chlorinated PCBs having reached steady state with the fish but not with the SPMD. Sediments were assumed to have reached equilibrium with PCBs in the water. Concentrations and patterns of dissolved PCB congeners were estimated from sediment data using an equilibrium model. The SPMD-based dissolved concentrations were estimated by using SPMD accumulation rates for 86 PCBs that were determined in an earlier SPMD calibration study. Steady-state bioconcentration factors for PCB congeners were used to estimate times required to reach steady state; congener concentrations in the fish were then normalized to steady state, and an equilibrium model was applied. The three methods indicated that similar patterns and concentrations of dissolved PCBs were present in the Saginaw River...|$|E

40|$|The Scheldt estuary (The Netherlands) {{consists}} of two tributaries, of which the western part is heavily polluted (i. e. domestic and <b>industrial</b> <b>pollutants,</b> <b>including</b> heavy metals) and the eastern is relatively clean. Pollutants generally follow downstream decreasing concentration gradients, thus opposing a natural occurring salinity gradient, which decreases upstream. Hence, the Scheldt estuary forms an interesting setting to investigate the effects of both anthropogenic and natural kind. The population genetic structure of the periwinkle, Littorina littorea, has already been studied in this estuary using esterases and RAPD markers. Both studies revealed an estuary based genetic structuring. This genetic patterning is unexpected since L. littorea has a planktonic larval development and thus little genetic differentiation is expected. However, radular myoglobin studies have shown intraspecific variation in L. littorea on a macrogeographical scale. In this contribution, myoglobin profiles of the radular muscle were phenotypically analysed along the Scheldt estuary, using isoelectric focusing. A total of 395 periwinkles, descending from four eastern estuarine, five western estuarine and one marine sampling site were collected and morphometrically characterized after which their individual Mb profile was determined. Four Mb bands could be identified {{and the distribution of}} each of these bands differed significantly between the western and eastern Scheldt estuary. In addition, eight different Mb phenotypes were detected of which the distribution differed between both estuaries as well, yielding a significantly higher phenotypic variability in the Western Scheldt. A Dice similarity distance based multidimensional scaling minimum spanning tree (MDS-MST) analysis revealed no clear differentiation between both estuaries. Likewise the MDS-MST analysis failed to detect phenotypic structuring along the pollution-salinity gradient of the Western Scheldt sampling sites. However, the only marine sampling site was clearly separated from the nine remaining estuarine locations in the MDS-MST plot. These preliminary data suggest, in the presence of intense gene flow, (1) a high level of phenotypic Mb variability and (2) a marine versus estuarine phenotypic Mb structuring...|$|E

Furthermore, {{a positive correlation between}} O 3 and CO in the plumes suggested that photochemical O 3 production occurred. A comparison of the model results with observations at JFJ revealed that the GEOS-Chem model tended to underestimate the O 3 concentrations (Guerova et al. 2006). Because the stratospheric contribution to the estimates based on the 7 Be/ 10 B ratio was shown to be reasonable (Zanis et al. 2003 b), Guerova et al. (2006) suggested that this discrepancy resulted from an underestimation of the European contribution. They found that a substantial North American contribution over Europe did not always result in O 3 enhancement in summer. Cui et al. (2009) estimated the contribution of stratospheric intrusion and intercontinental transport from the North American PBL to JFJ in 2005 by using FLEXPART and the Lagrangian analysis tool (LAGRANTO) trajectory model. They determined that JFJ was influenced by stratospheric intrusion during 19 and 18  % of the total annual time and by intercontinental transport from North American PBL during 13 and 12  % of the total annual time, as indicated by FLEXPART and LAGRANTO, respectively. At IZO, a good correlation between O 3 and CO in winter and spring was observed, suggesting long-range transport of photochemically generated O 3 from North America (Cuevas et al. 2013). Sholkovitz et al. (2009) estimated that from 12 to 30  % of the annual apportionment of the soluble aerosol Fe fluxes was contributed by anthropogenic aerosols. IZO has also been influenced by North African pollution. During the summer, IZO remains in the altitude of the Saharan Air Layer (SAL), which is exported westward at low tropical latitudes (< 15 ° N) in winter and at higher subtropical latitudes in summer (15 – 30 ° N; Rodríguez et al. 2011). Rodríguez et al. (2011) suggested that North African <b>industrial</b> <b>pollutants,</b> <b>including</b> emissions from crude oil refineries, the phosphate-based fertilizer industry, and power plants located at the Atlantic coast of Morocco, northern Algeria, eastern Algeria, and Tunisia might be mixed with desert dust and before being exported to the North Atlantic in the SAL.

40|$|Urbanization is {{considered}} a main indicator of regional economic development due to its positive effect on promoting industrial development; however, many regions, especially developing countries, have troubled in its negative effect—the aggravating environmental pollution. Many researchers have addressed that the rapid urbanization stimulated {{the expansion of the}} industrial production and increased the <b>industrial</b> <b>pollutant</b> emissions. However, this statement is exposed to a grave drawback in that urbanization not only expands industrial production but also improves labor productivity and changes industrial structure. To make up this drawback, we first decompose the influence of urbanization impacts on the <b>industrial</b> <b>pollutant</b> emissions into the scale effect, the intensive effect, and the structure effect by using the Kaya Identity and the LMDI Method; second, we perform an empirical study of the three effects by applying the spatial panel model {{on the basis of the}} data from 282 prefecture-level cities of China from 2003 to 2014. Our results indicate that (1) there are significant reverse U-shapes between China’s urbanization rate and the volume of industrial wastewater discharge, sulfur dioxide emissions and soot (dust) emissions; (2) the relationship between China’s urbanization and the <b>industrial</b> <b>pollutant</b> emissions depends on the scale effect, the intensive effect and the structure effect jointly. Specifically, the scale effect and the structure effect tend to aggravate the industrial wastewater discharge, the sulfur dioxide emissions and the soot (dust) emissions in China’s cities, while the intensive effect results in decreasing the three types of <b>industrial</b> <b>pollutant</b> emissions; (3) there are significant spatial autocorrelations of the <b>industrial</b> <b>pollutant</b> emissions among China’s cities, but the spatial spillover effect is non-existent or non-significant. We attempt to explain this contradiction due to the fact that the vast rural areas around China’s cities serve as sponge belts and absorb the spatial spillover of the <b>industrial</b> <b>pollutant</b> emissions from cities. According to the results, we argue the decomposition of the three effects is necessary and meaningful, it establishes a cornerstone in understanding the definite relationship between urbanization and <b>industrial</b> <b>pollutant</b> emissions, and effectively contributes to the relative policy making...|$|R

Yet, most human activities such as agriculture, domestic and industrial pollute water resources. Industries use water in different processes and if not well managed, they pollute water bodies. The study assessed the levels of <b>industrial</b> <b>pollutants</b> and their effects on water resources and livelihoods along Msimbazi sub catchment. Specifically, the study determined the types and abundance of pollutants discharged by industries, levels of <b>industrial</b> <b>pollutants</b> and their effects on water resources and livelihoods. It also reviewed relevant aspects of {{the implementation of the}} relevant aspect of Tanzania National Industrial Policy on cleaner production and how they relate with <b>industrial</b> <b>pollutants.</b> Primary and secondary methods of data collection were used. Primary methods of data collection such as in situ measurements, laboratory analysis of water samples, structured questionnaires, interview guides as well as observation. Secondary data were collected from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). Different documentations were reviewed to compare data collected through primary methods. Data were analyzed using both quantitative and qualitative methods. The quantitative techniques included descriptive statistics such as cross-tabulation, frequencies, percentages and means which was done using Statistical Packages for Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 18. 0 and Microsoft Excel 2007. Qualitative data was analyzed using Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis. The results show that the types and abundance of pollutants discharged by industries along the sub catchment were higher and to some points exceeding the World Health Organization (WHO) and Tanzania Bureau of Standards (TBS) standards. Pollutants such as COD was found to be the highest at Vingunguti with the COD of 2451. 57 mg/l and Tabata 1 recorded 879. 39 mg/l. Turbidity was higher at Vingunguti with 674 NTU and Kigogo 2 which had 357 NTU exceeded the TBS and WHO acceptable levels. DO was exceeding the standards in stations like Vingunguti and Kigogo 1 which had 0. 00 mg/l. DO was within the standards at upstream from the industries station. Chromium concentration was higher at Tabata 2 and Kigogo 2 and it was within the standards at the station upstream from the industries. Furthermore the results show that <b>industrial</b> <b>pollutants</b> was found to be affecting the water resources in terms of quality where the water quality parameters in some stations were exceeding the WHO and TBS permissible limits also livelihoods were found to be affected by the <b>industrial</b> <b>pollutants</b> in terms of health, agriculture and settlement.
