5|$|Goebel's and Beckham's {{challenges}} to the election results were received by the General Assembly on January 2. The following day, the Assembly appointed a contest committee to investigate the allegations contained in the challenges, voter fraud and illegal military intimidation of voters among them. The {{members of the committee}} were drawn at random, although the drawing was likely rigged—only one Republican joined ten <b>Democrats</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> committee. (Chance dictated that the committee should have contained four or five Republicans.) The joint committee on the rules recommended that the contest committee report at the pleasure of the General Assembly, that debate was limited once the findings were presented, and that the report be voted on in a joint session of the Assembly. The rules further provided that the speaker of the House would preside over this joint session instead of the lieutenant governor, as was customary. The Republican minority fought these provisions, but the Democratic majority passed them over their opposition.|$|E
5|$|Livingstone's {{relationship}} with Kate Allen ended in November 2001, although they remained friends. He then started a {{relationship with}} Emma Beal, together having two children, Thomas (born December 2002) and Mia (born March 2004). At a May 2002 party in Tufnell Park, Livingstone got into an argument with Beal's friend Robin Hedges, {{a reporter for the}} Evening Standard. Hedges subsequently fell off of a wall, bruised his ribs and ended up in hospital; the press claimed that Livingstone had pushed him, although he insisted that he did not. Liberal <b>Democrats</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> London Assembly referred the matter to the Standards Board for England, who ruled that there was no evidence for any wrongdoing on Livingstone's behalf.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{began to}} gain {{prominence}} in the small Democratic caucus by opposing Reconstruction measures. His delaying tactics against fellow Pennsylvanian Thaddeus Stevens's military Reconstruction bill in February 1867 kept the bill from being considered for two weeks—long enough {{to prevent it from}} being voted on until the next session. He likewise spoke against what would become the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Although he opposed the amendment, Randall did favor the idea behind part of it: section 4, which guarantees that Congress may not repudiate the federal debt, nor may it assume debts of the Confederacy, nor debt that the individual Confederate states incurred during the rebellion. Many Republicans claimed that if the Democrats were to regain power, they would do exactly that, repudiating federal debt and assuming that of the rebels. Despite disagreement on other facets of Reconstruction, Randall stood firmly with the Republicans (and most Northern <b>Democrats)</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> debt.|$|E

5|$|When the {{official}} tally was announced, Taylor had {{won by a}} vote of 193,714 to 191,331. Though the Board of Elections was thought to be controlled by Goebel allies, it voted 2–1 to certify the announced vote tally. The board's majority opinion claimed {{that they did not have}} any judicial power and were thus unable to hear proof or swear witnesses. Taylor was inaugurated on December 12, 1899. Goebel announced his decision to contest the board's decision to the General Assembly. The Assembly appointed a committee to investigate the allegations contained in the challenges. The members of the committee were drawn at random, though the drawing was likely rigged – only one Republican joined ten <b>Democrats</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> committee. (Chance dictated that the committee should have contained four or five Republicans.) Among the rules the General Assembly adopted for the contest committee were: that the committee report at the pleasure of the General Assembly, that debate be limited once the findings were presented, and that the report be voted on in a joint session of the Assembly. The rules further provided that the speaker of the House preside over the joint session instead of the lieutenant governor, as was customary. The Republican minority fought the provisions, but the Democratic majority passed them despite the opposition.|$|E
25|$|Also on September 13, 2016, all fifteen <b>Democrats</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> House Judiciary Committee sent {{a letter}} to Attorney General Loretta Lynch {{requesting}} that the Justice Department launch a criminal investigation of Trump in connection with his foundation’s $25,000 grant to Pam Bondi's campaign. The letter specifically cited possible violations of two anti-bribery laws.|$|E
25|$|Two {{months after}} being sworn in, Rizzo {{endorsed}} Richard Nixon, a Republican, for re-election as US president. In return for Rizzo's support, the victorious Nixon granted more federal funding to Philadelphia. But the action alienated many of Rizzo's supporters {{in his own}} party. The Democratic city committee, <b>Democrats</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> city council, and party chairman Peter Camiel viewed Rizzo's action as a betrayal.|$|E

25|$|Gabbard spoke against Trump's {{executive}} order banning refugees from seven predominantly Muslim countries, saying that thorough vetting was sufficient. She joined 20 <b>Democrats</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> House Foreign Affairs Committee urging Representative Ed Royce to call Michael Flynn {{to testify before}} them to investigate his and Trump's ties to Russia and whether American national security and intelligence operations have been compromised.|$|E
25|$|On September 22, 2005, {{during the}} hearing on Judge John Roberts's {{nomination}} for Chief Justice of the United States, Feingold {{was one of}} three <b>Democrats</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Senate Judiciary Committee to vote in favor of sending Roberts's nomination to the floor for a full vote. He also announced that he would vote to confirm Roberts. Feingold graduated from Harvard Law School the same year as Roberts, 1979. Feingold voted against Samuel Alito in committee and voted against cloture of debate regarding Alito's nomination on the Senate floor.|$|E
25|$|Alliance Party of Northern Ireland: the Alliance Party had one MP, Naomi Long, who {{had been}} elected {{for the first time}} in 2010. (Long lost her seat in 2015.) It was fifth in the 2010 {{election}} by vote share, fifth overall in 2011 and sixth in 2014. Alliance has a relationship with the Liberal Democrats in Great Britain: the party's former leader sits in the House of Lords as a Liberal Democrat, but Alliance's one MP elected in 2010 sat on the opposition benches in the Commons and not with the Liberal <b>Democrats</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> government benches. The party contested all 18 Northern Irish constituencies in 2015.|$|E

25|$|With most Republicans lukewarm about Beeson {{and some}} {{actually}} thinking of abstaining or voting against him, Eisenhower began lobbying conservative Southern Democrats {{to support the}} nomination. On January 29, Senators H. Alexander Smith (chair of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare) and Barry Goldwater then publicly questioned the truthfulness of Beeson's January 20 response about the newspaper article. The newspaper, the San Jose Mercury, said it stood by its story. Beeson then made the surprising request on January 30 to speak again before the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee. The request was granted. Democratic Senator James E. Murray said Beeson's integrity had been called into question, and all six <b>Democrats</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee said that new revelations that Farmer and Beeson had a pre-existing relationship indicated Beeson would not be independent of Farmer's influence. But during a six-hour hearing on February 2, Beeson admitted that the newspaper article was correct. When directly {{asked if he had}} submitted a letter of resignation, he said he had not but had given an oral resignation. He then admitted that he had not stopped making contributions to his company's pension plan, and implied he was really on a leave of absence. He also reversed his January 22 testimony and said Farmer had not recommended him to Eisenhower at all. His revelations led to an adjournment so that Paul L. Davies, president of Food Machinery & Chemical Corporation, could be brought in to testify.|$|E
500|$|The {{disintegration}} of Russia offered the Finns a historic opportunity to gain national independence, {{but after the}} October Revolution, {{the positions of the}} conservatives and the Social <b>Democrats</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sovereignty issue became reversed. The conservatives were eager for secession from Russia, in order to control the left and minimize the influence of the Bolsheviks. The socialists feared a loss of support among nationalistic workers, after promises of increasing liberty, through the [...] "Power Act". Both political factions supported Finland's sovereignty, despite strong disagreement on selection of the leadership.|$|E
500|$|On November 19, 1998, Starr {{testified before}} the House Judiciary Committee in {{connection}} with the impeachment of Bill Clinton over charges related to the Lewinsky scandal. [...] Here, for the first time, Starr exonerated President Clinton of complicity in the travel office affair, saying that while investigations were not complete, [...] "the president was not involved in our... investigation." [...] (Starr also chose this occasion to clear President Clinton in the Filegate matter, and to say he had not committed impeachable wrongdoing in the Whitewater matter; <b>Democrats</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> committee immediately criticized Starr for withholding all these findings until after the 1998Congressional elections.) ...|$|E

500|$|Theramenes ( [...] ; died 404 BC) was an Athenian statesman, {{prominent}} in the final decade of the Peloponnesian War. He was particularly active during the two periods of oligarchic government at Athens, {{as well as in}} the trial of the generals who had commanded at Arginusae in 406 BC. A moderate oligarch, he often found himself caught between the <b>democrats</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> one hand and the extremist oligarchs on the other. Successful in replacing a narrow oligarchy with a broader one in 411 BC, he failed to achieve the same end in 404 BC, and was executed by the extremists whose policies he had opposed.|$|E
500|$|Appearing {{before the}} Judiciary Committee on January 19, Baird apologized for having knowingly broken the law: [...] "In my {{hope to find}} {{appropriate}} child care for my son, I gave too little emphasis to what was described {{to me as a}} technical violation of law." [...] She added that, [...] "People are fairly questioning if there are classes of individuals who hold themselves above the law. I do not." [...] Baird's statement that her husband had handled many of the legal issues surrounding the Corderos' employment drew little support for her. Overall, the questioning of Baird was tougher from <b>Democrats</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> committee than Republicans, again reflecting the latter's support for Baird. At the close of the initial testimony, Baird's confirmation still seemed quite possible.|$|E
500|$|In an 1869 Congressional {{investigation}} into the gold panic, <b>Democrats</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> House investigation committee questioned why Julia Grant had received a package from the Adams Express Company containing money reported to be $25,000. Another source claims that the package was just $25.00, but nonetheless, it was highly unusual for a First Lady to receive cash in the mail. Corbin had bought gold at 33 margin and sold at 37, leaving Julia a profit of $27,000. [...] Neither Mrs. Grant nor Mrs. Corbin testified {{in front of the}} investigation committee. [...] In 1876 Secretary of State Hamilton Fish revealed to Grant in that Orville E. Babcock, another private secretary to the President, had also been involved in gold speculations in 1869.|$|E

500|$|On November 19, 1998, Independent Counsel Starr {{testified before}} the House Judiciary Committee in {{connection}} with the Impeachment of Bill Clinton over charges related to the Lewinsky scandal. [...] Here, for the first time, Starr exonerated both President Clinton and the First Lady of complicity in the FBI files matter, saying [...] "while there are outstanding issues that we are attempting to resolve with respect to one individual [...] found no evidence that anyone higher [...] was in any way involved in ordering the files from the FBI. Second, we have found no evidence that information contained in the files of former officials was used for an improper purpose." [...] (Starr also chose this occasion to clear President Clinton in the Travelgate matter, and to say that he had not committed impeachable wrongdoing in the Whitewater matter; <b>Democrats</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> committee immediately criticized Starr for withholding all these findings until after the 1998 Congressional elections.) ...|$|E
500|$|The Liberal Democrats {{opened their}} {{selection}} process on 8 June 2015. Applications were due by noon on 22 June 2015 and six potential nominees stood to be candidates. Four {{of these were}} not shortlisted: Brian Haley, a former Labour councillor in Haringey, who also [...] unsuccessfully stood for the Liberal Democrat candidacy in 2012; Teena Lashmore, a criminologist, community activist and Liberal Democrat candidate in Bethnal Green and Bow at the 2015 general election; Marisha Ray, a former councillor in Islington; and Paul Reynolds, former councillor. Of the remaining candidates, Duwayne Brooks OBE, former councillor in Lewisham, withdrew due to his commitments to a review of police stop and search powers. This left Caroline Pidgeon, leader of the Liberal <b>Democrats</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> London Assembly, as the only remaining candidate. She was selected, winning 90% of the 3669 votes on a 39% turnout, against the option to Re-Open Nominations, as announced on 17 September 2015.|$|E
500|$|The Treaty [...] "generously" [...] {{restored}} most of {{the colonies}} that had been lost to the British since 1795, except Ceylon, but including the Cape Colony. This now made the attempts in the Asiatic Council, which had replaced the Directorate of the VOC in 1799, to reform {{the management of the}} colonies, more urgent. Dirk van Hogendorp was commissioned to write a proposal, that met with considerable enthusiasm from the more progressive elements on the council, like Samuel Iperusz. Wiselius. He proposed to abolish all perquisites and sinecures; to permit private trade; to permit native subjects to own private property; to substitute the [...] "land levies" [...] by a regulated land tax; and the abolition of all seigneurial rights in the colonies. This met with overwhelming resistance from vested interests. When a new Charter for the colonies was promulgated, Hogendorp's proposals had been whittled down to insignificance The vestigial <b>democrats</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Council were now purged in favor of Orangist reactionaries like Hendrik Mollerus, and Hendrik Van Stralen. In any case, the Republic did not enjoy the possession of its colonies for long. After the resumption of hostilities in 1803 the returned colonies in most cases were soon reoccupied by the British. Java, however, held out till 1811.|$|E
