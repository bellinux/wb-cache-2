6000|$|Who are my winter visitors? The {{chief of}} them is the doctor. We have no doctor, of course, up here, and this one has to come twelve miles to us. He is rather melancholy when we send for him; but he wastes no time in coming, though he may not have had his clothes off for twenty-four hours, and is well aware that we cannot pay big fees. Several times he has had to remain with me all night, and once he was snowed up here for a week. At times, too, he drives so far on his way to us and then has to turn back because the gig sticks on the heavy roads. He is only a doctor in a small country town, but I am elated when I see him, for he can tell me whether the Government is still in power. Then I have the school {{inspector}} once a year. The school inspector is always threatening to change the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> to summer, but he takes the town from which the doctor comes in early spring, and finds it convenient to come from there to here. Early spring is often winter with us, so that the school inspector comes when there is usually snow on the ground or threatening. The school is a mile away at another [...] "clachan," [...] but the inspector dines with me, and so does the schoolmaster. On these occasions the schoolmaster is not such good company as at other times, for he is anxious about his passes, and explains (as I think) more than is necessary that regular attendance {{is out of the question}} in a place like this. The inspector's visit is the time of my great annual political debate, for the doctor calls politics [...] "fudge." [...] The inspector and I are on different sides, however, and we go at each other hammer and tongs, while the schoolmaster signs to me with his foot not to anger the inspector.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{frequent}} and dangerous failure modes in continuous welded rails is fatigue crack propagation terminated by brittle fracture. Due to the brittleness of the weld material and HAZ and the scatter in its mechanical properties, a statistical approach is necessary. The paper deals with surface cracks at the foot base of aluminothermic welded rails, developing a probabilistic methodology for determining the day by day prospective failure probability. The investigations presented here comprise weld material characterization, simulation of fatigue crack propagation and finally {{the determination of the}} failure probability using the Monte Carlo method. The effect of various parameters, such as axle weight, initial crack size, residual stresses, fatigue crack propagation threshold and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> were analyzed. The results show that, independent of the date of the last inspection, almost any failure event happens in wintertime. This is in accordance with practical experience. However, from the proposed analysis it is evident that the main parameter controlling rail fracture is not only the minimum local temperature, but the temperature range over the whole year. Finally, the results are compared to the standard rail classification method...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether the virulence of HIV- 1 has been changing since its introduction into Switzerland. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study of HIV- 1 infected individuals with well-characterized pre-therapy disease history. METHODS: To minimize the effect of recently imported viruses and ethnicity-associated host factors, the analysis was restricted to the white, north-west-European majority population of the cohort. Virulence was characterized by the decline slope of the CD 4 cell count (n = 817 patients), the decline slope of the CD 4 :CD 8 ratio (n = 815 patients) and the viral setpoint (n = 549 patients) in untreated patients with sufficient data points. Linear regression models were used to detect correlations between the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> diagnosis (ranging between 1984 and 2003) and the virulence markers, controlling for gender, exposure category, age and CD 4 cell count at entry. RESULTS: We found no correlation between any of the virulence markers and the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> diagnosis. <b>Inspection</b> <b>of</b> short-term trends confirmed that virulence has fluctuated around a stable level over time. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of long-term time trends in the virulence markers indicates that HIV- 1 is not evolving towards increasing or decreasing virulence at a perceptible rate. Both highly virulent and attenuated strains have apparently been unable to spread at the population level. This result suggests that either the evolution of virulence may be slow or inhibited due to evolutionary constraints, or HIV- 1 may have already evolved to optimal virulence in the human host...|$|R
