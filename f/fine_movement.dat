500|$|The {{cerebellum}} (Latin for [...] "little brain") is a {{major feature}} of the hindbrain of all vertebrates. [...] Although usually smaller than the cerebrum, in some animals such as the mormyrid fishes it may be as large as or even larger. In humans, the cerebellum {{plays an important role}} in motor control, and it may also be involved in some cognitive functions such as attention and language as well as in regulating fear and pleasure responses, but its movement-related functions are the most solidly established. The human cerebellum does not initiate movement, but contributes to coordination, precision, and accurate timing: it receives input from sensory systems of the spinal cord and from other parts of the brain, and integrates these inputs to fine-tune motor activity. Cerebellar damage produces disorders in <b>fine</b> <b>movement,</b> equilibrium, posture, and motor learning in humans.|$|E

6000|$|Even more {{important}} than the exposition of human knowledge was the exposition of the degrees by which it had been slowly reared. The Preliminary Discourse to the Encyclopædia, of which by far the greater and more valuable portion was written by D'Alembert, contains a fine survey of the progress of science, thought, and letters since the revival of learning. It is a generous canonisation of the great heroes of secular knowledge. It is rapid, but the contributions of Bacon, Descartes, Newton, Locke, Leibnitz are thrown into a series that penetrates the reader's mind with the idea of ordered growth and measured progress. This excited a vivid hopefulness of interest, which insensibly but most effectually pressed the sterile propositions of dogmatic theology into a dim and squalid background. Nor was this all. The Preliminary Discourse and the host of articles marshalled behind it, showed that the triumphs of knowledge and true opinion had all been gained on two conditions. The first of these conditions was a firm disregard of authority; the second was an abstention from the premature concoction of system. The reign of ignorance and prejudice was made inveterate by deference to tradition: the reign of truth was hindered by the artificial boundary-marks set mischievously deep by the authors of systems. As the whole spirit of theology is both essentially authoritative and essentially systematic, this disparagement was full of tolerably direct significance. It told in another way. The Sorbonne, the universities, the doctors, had identified orthodoxy with Cartesianism. [...] "It is hard to believe," [...] says D'Alembert in 1750, [...] "that it is only within the last thirty years that people have even begun to renounce Cartesianism." [...] He might have added {{that one of the most}} powerful of his contemporaries, Montesquieu himself, remained a rigid Cartesian to the end of his days. [...] "Our nation," [...] he says, [...] "singularly eager as it is for novelties in all matters of taste, is in matters of science extremely attached to old opinions." [...] This remark remains true of France to the present hour, and it would be an interesting digression, did time allow, to consider its significance. France can at all events count one master innovator, the founder of Cartesianism himself. D'Alembert points out that the disciples violate the first maxims of their chief. He describes the hypothesis of vortices and the doctrine of innate ideas as no longer tenable, and even as ridiculous; but do not let us forget, he says with a <b>fine</b> <b>movement</b> of candour, that it was Descartes who opened the way; he who set an example to men of intelligence, of shaking off the yoke of scholasticism, of opinion, of authority--in a word, of prejudices and barbarism. Those who remain faithful to his hypothetical system, while they abandon his method, may be the last of his partisans, but they would assuredly never have been the first of his disciples.|$|E
50|$|After {{patients}} are lesioned in {{some part of}} the pyramidal tracts, they are paralyzed on the corresponding side of the body. However, they can re-learn some crude, basic motions, just no fine movements.

5000|$|Gamma motor neurons {{assist in}} keeping the muscle spindle taut, thus {{adjusting}} sensitivity. Therefore, if proper gamma motor neuronal firing does not occur, muscle movement can be adversely affected. Fine motor skills such as movements with the fingers and eyes are affected most, since any lack of tautness within the muscle spindle hinders its ability to detect the amount of stretch through the sensory endings. This means that the muscle {{will not be able}} to precisely move accordingly. Lesions controlling descending pathways in lower motor neurons to the upper limbs, can cause a loss in patient's ability to have <b>fine</b> <b>movement</b> control.|$|E
5000|$|Three {{modalities}} are {{received by}} cerebellum, including proprioception, nociception, and somatic input, {{and all of}} these stimulate the dentate nucleus. The dentate nucleus is mostly responsible for planning and execution of <b>fine</b> <b>movement.</b> Since any motor function requires sensory information, it can be assumed that the dentate nucleus receives and modulates this sensory information, though the specific mechanism of this remains unclear. For example, the act of lifting an object requires sensory input, such as the size of the object and where it is located in space. While the primary role of the dentate nucleus is control of the movement, it does play a role in sensory processing as well.|$|E

40|$|Background and Aim: Normal & {{skillful}} {{function of}} hand {{is an essential}} part of activity of daily living. Analysis of the function of hand shows the major contribution of fine movements.   <b>Fine</b> <b>movement</b> is also important in motor development. In this regard, any deficiency in <b>fine</b> <b>movement</b> may cause various problems for children. Hence, assessment of <b>fine</b> <b>movement</b> in children, particularly in mental retardation disorders is a prerequisite of any rehabilitation protocol.   Material & Methods: 27 mental retarded children were participated in this cross sectional study.   Children were in the range of 7 - 10 Yrs (Mean & SD, 8 / 11 & 1 / 09 yrs, respectively). Parents were asked to sign the informed consent. Purdue Peg board test was used for the assessment of hand skill. After fifteen sessions of intervention including eye hand coordination activities, Purdue Peg board test were repeated. Results: Speed of movements (rates in 30 seconds) in dominant & recessive hand, coordination of both hands and hand skills were significantly differed (pre & post intervention, P≤ 0 / 05). It was also revealed that hand skills are directly related with speed movement of dominant hand. (P≤  0 / 05).   Furthermore, there was no difference in the eye hand coordination activities of male and female individuals. (P≤  0 / 05).   Conclusion: The results of this study showed that eye-hand coordination activities have positively affected the skill of hand movement in educable Mental retardation students in both sex. Simple skills such as speed of hand improved in shorter time in comparison with complicated skills (e. g. coordination of tow hand). Based on these evidences, a comprehensive rehabilitation program including eye hand coordination activities would be suggested for educable Mental retardation individual...|$|E
