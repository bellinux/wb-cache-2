5|$|What {{is today}} {{considered}} {{the front of}} the vessel depicts six masks surrounding an anclabris. The anclabris is depicted as if it were made out of marble, and two sphinxes—beings that serve as allegories for the secrets and mysteries of the Dionysian cult—are supporting the table. On the anclabris stands a small statue of Hermes, next to which <b>hangs</b> <b>a</b> mask with pipes. Above this mask may very well be the raven of Apollo. On {{the left side of the}} table, a goat is seen resting on the ground, surrounded by the symbols of the cult. Finally, a wicker basket can be found to the right of the table, out of which a snake emerges; this basket motif is often found in Dionysian artwork, and seemingly was an object of great importance to the religion.|$|E

25|$|The Tinney Family, of Cumberland, Rhode Island, bought Belcourt in 1956 for $25,000. In {{addition}} to changing the name from Belcourt to Belcourt Castle, the Tinneys filled the castle {{with their own}} collection of antiques and reproductions. Included are a coronation coach, which the Tinneys made, and a 1701 copy of a Hyacinthe Rigaud portrait of Louis XIV, which hung in the Green Room in the Palace of the Tuileries. The centerpiece of the Tinney additions was an enormous Imperial Russian-style chandelier, which holds 13,000 rock crystal prisms and 105 lights.

Near the entrance to its dining hall is a bronze casting, which depicts the symbol of an electrical transformer, and inside there <b>hangs</b> <b>a</b> portrait, both in Faraday's honour. An eight-story {{building at}} the University of Edinburgh's science & engineering campus is named for Faraday, as is a recently built hall of accommodation at Brunel University, the main engineering building at Swansea University, and the instructional and experimental physics building at Northern Illinois University.

25|$|The timber {{ceiling is}} in a concave form and {{is made up}} of three rows of six {{rectangular}} panels. All eighteen panels are rather simply ornamented, with a simple rectangular border and a ceiling rose at their centres. The ceiling roses in the centre row are larger and more elaborate than those in the side rows. From the centre of each circle <b>hangs</b> <b>a</b> lamp. The ceiling edge ends in deeply mouled plaster cornice that runs {{along the length of the}} cathedral. As the height of the east end has been raised at different times, the dimensions of the entablature no longer relate to the columns properly, as their bases have been raised. The Cathedral was once lit with victorian crystal chandeliers, but these have since been replaced with the simpler lamps one sees today.|$|E
25|$|The second room {{houses the}} Topkapı Dagger. The golden hilt is ornamented with three large emeralds, {{topped by a}} golden watch with an emerald lid. The golden {{scabbard}} is covered with diamonds and enamel. In 1747, the Sultan Mahmud I had this dagger made for Nader Shah of Persia, but the Shah was assassinated {{in connection with a}} revolt before the emissary had left the Ottoman Empire's boundaries. This dagger gained more fame as the object of the heist depicted of the film Topkapi. In the middle of the second room stands the walnut throne of Ahmed I, inlaid with nacre and tortoise shell, built by Sedekhar Mehmed Agha. Below the baldachin <b>hangs</b> <b>a</b> golden pendant with a large emerald. The next displays show the ostentatious aigrettes of the sultans and their horses, studded with diamonds, emeralds and rubies. A jade bowl, shaped like a vessel, was a present of Czar Nicholas II of Russia.|$|E

It {{is in the}} latter space that honours and awards ceremonies take place, members of the Cabinet are sworn in, ambassadors present their diplomatic credentials, and large-scale state dinners are held; as such, {{it is the second}} most photographed and televised room in Canada, preceded only by the House of Commons. A double-height space, it is lined with tall, arched windows between rectangular pilasters that are topped with gilt, acanthused capitals. Cable moulding trim surrounds most of the openings and, {{around the perimeter of the}} room, at the intersection of walls and ceiling, is a deep and ornate plaster crown moulding formed by a godroon textured frieze and a heavy dentiled bed-mould between layers of talon and gorge mouldings. Above this is the Victorian, lacunar, clear span vaulted ceiling, from the centre of which <b>hangs</b> <b>a</b> Waterford Crystal chandelier, presented by the British government on Victoria Day in 1951 as a token of gratitude for Canada's role in World War II. Also, in an alcove to the south of the ballroom's main door is a stained glass window that celebrates the excellence of Canadian performing artists and the establishment of the Governor General's Performing Arts Awards.|$|E
