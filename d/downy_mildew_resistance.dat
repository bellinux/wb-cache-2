40|$|<b>Downy</b> <b>mildew</b> {{disease is}} a major devastating disease caused by Sclerospora graminicola in pearl millet. Although disease {{management}} studies have indicated several biological as well as chemical control measures, the durability of resistance {{appears to be a}} major problem and has been attributed to the lack of understanding of pathogenic or resistance processes at molecular levels. Present study reveals the involvement of plasma membrane H+-ATPase in <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> disease <b>resistance</b> and offer H+-ATPase assay as a tool to evaluate <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> disease <b>resistance</b> in host cultivars resistant to all existing pathotypes, pathotypes 1 - 5. H+-ATPase was activated by fungal attack in all resistant cultivars but not in susceptible cultivars. The level of H+-ATPase was correlated with the degree of resistance as evaluated by field screening studies. Upregulation of H+-ATPase was specifically in the coleoptile region, which is the susceptible site for the attack by the <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> pathogen. The upregulated levels of H+-ATPase activity were also observed in resistant cell suspension and correlated with acidification of the extracellular medium. There was no change in either H+-ATPase activity or acidification in susceptible cell suspensions. Serological evidence for the upregulation of H+-ATPase activity only in resistant pearl millet has also been provided using a monoclonal antibody (MAb 46 E 5 B 11 F 6) against maize H+-ATPase by ELISA as well as immunoblot. A 100 -kDa band was specifically increased 3 -fold in the resistant cultivar. The results of the investigation suggest that plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity may be involved in the initial step of <b>resistance</b> to the <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> disease pathogen and the increase in activity could be due to activation by post translational modification as well as by upregulating the enzyme synthesis.

The study material comprised six generations (susceptible and resistant parents, F- 1, F- 2, BC 1 and BC 2) in three crosses. Seedlings from these generations were inoculated with the <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> pathogen Sclerospora graminicola and disease incidence was recorded. Analysis of constitutive levels of beta - 1, 3 -glucanase and peroxidase in the seedlings of different generations indicated that the resistant populations showed higher enzyme activities, while lower activities of the enzymes were recorded in the susceptible populations. In the generation-mean analysis, the significance of scaling tests revealed the existence of nonallelic interactions in the {{inheritance of}} <b>resistance</b> to <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> {{as well as with}} the enzymes. Among the gene effects, both additive and dominant effects were significant. All the non-allelic interaction effects were significant in the crosses.

40|$|A {{genetic linkage}} map was {{constructed}} using a pseudo-testcross strategy {{based on a}} cross between the seedless Vitis vinifera ?Crimson Seedless? and the complex hybrid ?Villard Blanc?, resistant to downy mildew. A total of 315 DNA markers, including 262 AFLP, 48 simple sequence repeats (SSR), 2 SCARs (sequence characterized amplified region) and 3 minisatellite markers were used to generate a map for each parent. For both parents, 19 linkage groups were obtained, covering 1, 111. 0 cM and 926. 0 cM for ?Villard Blanc? and ?Crimson Seedless?, respectively. The position of SSR loci in the obtained maps {{is consistent with the}} genomic sequence. Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) for seedlessness and resistance to downy mildew were investigated. Two major effect QTLs for <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> <b>resistance</b> and seedlessness were mapped on the same region of linkage group 18. These QTLs explain 25. 0 - 55. 7 % and 54. 0 - 62., 4 % of the total variance, respectively. The MIKCC-Type MADS box gene VvAG 3, whose orthologue is involved in Arabidopsis carpel and ovule development, and located in the confidence interval of the seedlessness QTL detected on the LG 18, could be considered as a candidate gene to control seed development in grape. Colocalizations were found in the same region, between the position of the Rpv 3 locus, which is very rich in TIR-NBS-LRR genes, and the main QTL identified for <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> <b>resistance.</b> Our results demonstrate that the same region of LG 18 contains important genetic determinants for seedlessness and <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> <b>resistance</b> in grapevine.

Following BABA treatment, sporulation of Plasmopara viticola was strongly reduced and the accumulation of stilbenes increased with time following infection. Induction of trans-piceide, trans-resveratrol and, more importantly, of trans-ɛ- and trans-δ-viniferin and trans-pterostilbene was observed in BABA-primed Chasselas. On the other hand, induction of trans-resveratrol, trans δ-viniferin and trans-pterostilbene was observed in BABA-primed Solaris. The accumulation of stilbenes in BABA-primed Solaris was much higher than that found in BABA-primed Chasselas. Furthermore, BABA-treatment of Solaris led to a rapid increase in transcript levels of three genes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway: phenylalanine ammonia lyase, cinnamate- 4 -hydroxylase and stilbene synthase. BABA-primed Chasselas showed increased transcript levels for cinnamate- 4 -hydroxylase and stilbene synthase. Here we show that pre-treatment of a susceptible grapevine cultivar with BABA prior to infection with P. viticola primed the accumulation of specific phytoalexins that are undetectable in non-BABA-primed plants.

Pathotypic variation amongst Hyaloperonospora brassicae isolates from Brassica oleracea has also been described; however, a standard set of B. oleracea lines that could enable reproducible classification of H. brassicae pathotypes was poorly developed.

Interaction phenotypes for each combination of isolate and host line were assessed following drop inoculation of cotyledons and a spectrum of seven phenotypes was observed based {{on the level of}} sporulation on cotyledons and visible host responses. Two host lines were resistant or moderately resistant to the entire collection of isolates, and another was universally susceptible. Five lines showed differential responses to the H. brassicae isolates. A minimum of six pathotypes and five major effect resistance genes are proposed to explain all of the observed interaction phenotypes. The B. oleracea lines from this study can be useful for monitoring pathotype frequencies in H. brassicae populations in the same or other vegetable growing regions, and to assess the potential durability of disease control from different combinations of the predicted <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> <b>resistance</b> genes...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Downy</b> <b>mildews</b> are {{the most}} speciose group of oomycetes and affect crops of great {{economic}} importance. So far, {{there is only a}} single deeply-sequenced <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> genome available, from Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis. Further genomic resources for <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> are required to study their evolution, including pathogenicity effector proteins, such as RxLR effectors. Plasmopara halstedii is a devastating pathogen of sunflower and a potential pathosystem model to study <b>downy</b> <b>mildews,</b> as several Avr-genes and R-genes have been predicted and unlike Arabidopsis <b>downy</b> <b>mildew,</b> large quantities of almost contamination-free material can be obtained easily. Results: Here a high-quality draft genome of Plasmopara halstedii is reported and analysed with respect to various aspects, including genome organisation, secondary metabolism, effector proteins and comparative genomics with other sequenced oomycetes. Interestingly, the present analyses revealed further variation of the RxLR motif, suggesting an important role of the conservation of the dEER-motif. Orthology analyses revealed the conservation of 28 RxLR-like core effectors among Phytophthora species. Only six putative RxLR-like effectors were shared by the two sequenced <b>downy</b> <b>mildews,</b> highlighting the fast and largely independent evolution of two of the three major <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> lineages. This is seemingly supported by phylogenomic results, in which <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> {{did not appear to be}} monophyletic. Conclusions: The genome resource will be useful for developing markers for monitoring the pathogen population and might provide the basis for new approaches to fight Phytophthora and <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> pathogens by targeting core pathogenicity effectors...|$|R
50|$|<b>Downy</b> <b>mildew</b> {{is another}} disease to which {{sunflowers}} are susceptible. Its susceptibility to <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> is particular high {{due to the}} sunflower's way of growth and development. Sunflower seeds are generally planted only an inch deep in the ground. When such shallow planting is done in moist and soaked earth or soil, it increases the chances of diseases such as <b>downy</b> <b>mildew.</b>|$|R
40|$|Pathogens {{belonging}} to the Oomycota, a group of heterokont, fungal-like organisms, are amongst the most notorious pathogens in agriculture. In particular, the obligate biotrophic <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> and the hemibiotrophic members of the genus Phytophthora are responsible for a huge variety of destructive diseases, including sudden oak death caused by P. ramorum, potato late blight caused by P. infestans, cucurbit <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> caused by Pseudoperonospora cubensis, and grape <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> caused by Plasmopara viticola. About 800 species of <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> and roughly 100 species of Phytophthora are currently accepted, and recent studies have revealed that these groups are closely related. However, {{the degree to which}} Phytophthora is paraphyletic and where exactly the <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> insert into this genus in relation to other clades could not be inferred with certainty to date. Here we present a molecular phylogeny encompassing all clades of Phytophthora as represented in a multi-locus dataset and two representatives of the monophyletic <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> from divergent genera. Our results demonstrate that Phytophthora is at least six times paraphyletic with respect to the <b>downy</b> <b>mildews.</b> The <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> representatives are consistently nested within clade 4 (contains Phytophthora palmivora), which is placed sister to clade 1 (contains Phytophthora infestans). This finding would either necessitate placing all <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> and Phytopthora species in a single genus, either under the oldest generic name Peronospora or by conservation the later name Phytophthora, or the description of at least six new genera within Phytophthora. The complications of both options are discussed, and it is concluded that the latter is preferable, as it warrants fewer name changes and is more practical...|$|R

40|$|The Amur grape (Vitis amurensis Rupr.) thrives {{naturally}} in cool climates of Northeast Asia. Resistance against the introduced pathogen Plasmopara viticola is common among wild ecotypes that were propagated from Manchuria into Chinese vineyards or collected by Soviet botanists in Siberia, {{and used for}} the introgression of resistance into wine grapes (Vitis vinifera L.). A QTL analysis revealed a dominant gene Rpv 12 that explained 79 % of the phenotypic variance for <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> <b>resistance</b> and was inherited independently of other resistance genes. A Mendelian component of resistance-a hypersensitive response in leaves challenged with P. viticola-was mapped in an interval of 0. 2 cM containing an array of coiled-coil NB-LRR genes on chromosome 14. We sequenced 10 -kb genic regions in the Rpv 12 (+) haplotype and identified polymorphisms in 12 varieties of V. vinifera using next-generation sequencing. The combination of two SNPs in single-copy genes flanking the NB-LRR cluster distinguished the resistant haplotype from all others found in 200 accessions of V. vinifera, V. amurensis, and V. amurensis x V. vinifera crosses. The Rpv 12 (+) haplotype is shared by 15 varieties, the most ancestral of which are the century-old 'Zarja severa' and 'Michurinets'. Before this knowledge, the chromosome segment around Rpv 12 (+) became introgressed, shortened, and pyramided with another <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> <b>resistance</b> gene from North American grapevines (Rpv 3) only by phenotypic selection. Rpv 12 (+) has an additive effect with Rpv 3 (+) to protect vines against natural infections, and confers foliar resistance to strains that are virulent on Rpv 3 (+) plants...|$|E
40|$|Downy mildew (Sclerospora graminicola (Sacc) Schroet.) of {{pearl millet}} [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br. ] is a devastating disease that has greatly led to grain yield loss in Nigeria. A field {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} in 2010 at Bakura (Zamfara State) and Zaria (Kaduna State) in North West Nigeria. The objective of this paper was to evaluate <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> <b>resistance</b> in some pearl millet using Complete Randomized Block Design. Four resistant male varieties (PEO 5532, SOSATC 88, P 1449 and DMR 15) and four susceptible female varieties (BDP 1, MOP 1, LCIC 9702 and PEO 5984 were used in this study. The resistant varieties were crossed with the susceptible varieties using North Carolina design 11 for the mating to form sixteen (F 1) hybrids. The F 1 hybrids were further evaluated along with their parents for <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> <b>resistance,</b> grain yield and other agronomic traits (such as: Plant height, panicle height, number of tillers per plant, panicle diameter and number panicles per plot). The resistant male parents were found to be susceptible while none of the hybrids was resistant to downy mildew. However, the degree of incidence and severity of downy mildew disease defer in the two locations. The hybrids exhibited tolerance to downy mildew disease and their yields were higher than their parents. The analysis of variance (one tale ANOVA or which one?) showed highly significant difference among parents and hybrids for all agronomic characters except disease severity and number of tillers per plant. Location × genotype interaction effects were only significant for grain yield and number of panicles per plot...|$|E
40|$|<b>Downy</b> <b>mildews</b> {{and root}} and foliar rots caused by Phytophthora {{are among the}} most {{destructive}} plant pathogens and therefore have attracted considerable attention during the past two decades. Although it has been realized that a close phylogenetic relationship exists, so far sharp distinction has been made between the obligate biotrophic <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> and the hemibiotrophic Phytophthora. In the study presented here, it is shown that a continuum of character states from hemibiotrophic Phytophthora species to obligate biotrophic <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> is present. Intermediate character states between <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> and Phytophthora species exist in several rare parasites of grasses, which are not embedded within the major clades of the <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> but are placed sister to these, with unresolved affinities to both these clades and to Phytophthora. They still have retained traits hitherto thought to be exclusive for Phytophthora. A careful review of previous research is presented and it is highlighted that uniquely for <b>downy</b> <b>mildews,</b> Poakatesthia may form an intracellular mycelium, growing through several host cells. In addition, scanning electron microscopy reveals that sporangiophore growth is not determinate in Viennotia and that outgrowth from sporangiophores is very similar to Phytophthora infestans. It is concluded that the sharp morphological distinction between <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> and Phytophthora species (that are often placed in separate families and even different orders), is rather artificial, since all features thought to be exclusive to Phytophthora or the <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> are united in the rare grass-parasitizing down mildew genera Viennotia and Poakatesthia and the enigmatic genus Sclerophthora. Therefore, several paradigms regarding the distinction between Phytophthora and the <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> need to be reconsidered...|$|R
50|$|<b>Downy</b> <b>mildew</b> left {{uncontrolled}} has {{the ability}} to reduce yields by up to 55% and infest up to 80% of plants. <b>Downy</b> <b>mildew</b> is primarily controlled through the use of several fungicides applied during midseason.

Farmers in Florida who regularly use fungicides have been shown to reduce yield losses due to <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> to as low as 2%.|$|R
40|$|Two {{formulations}} of the systemic fungicide metalaxyl {{were used as}} seed treatment for the control of pearl millet <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> in seven field experiments with <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> susceptible pearl millet hybrid NHB- 3.

Significant reduction in <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> was obtained with all fungicide treatments under severe <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> pressure. Storage temperatures for 7, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360 days did not affect seed germination. The plots sown w. ith metalaxyl 35 SD (2 g a. i. /kg) treated seeds stored at 12, 28 – 30 and 40 °C {{for a period of}} 7 days developed significantly less <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> than check plots.
