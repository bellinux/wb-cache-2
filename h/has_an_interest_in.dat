5|$|In Europe golden jackals are {{not listed}} under the 1973 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora nor the 1979 Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. Golden jackals in Europe fall under various {{international}} legal instruments. These include the 1979 Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity, and the 1992 European Union Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna and Flora. The Council Directive provides both guidance and limits on what participating governments can do when {{responding to the}} arrival of expanding jackals. These legislative instruments aim to contribute to conserving native wildlife; some governments argue that the golden jackal is not native wildlife but an invading species. The Golden Jackal informal study Group in Europe (GOJAGE) is an organization that is formed by researchers from across Europe to collect and share information on the golden jackal in Europe. The group also <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the golden jackal's relationship with its environment across Eurasia. Membership is open to anyone that <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> golden jackals.|$|E

5|$|In {{the event}} that a person lacks standing, there is a {{possibility}} that he or she may be able to ask the Attorney-General to allow him or her to bring a relator action. In this scenario, the Attorney-General would be the nominal plaintiff in the judicial review proceedings, but the case would actually be conducted by the individual. Bringing a relator action is one means of circumventing the requirement of standing on the part of the individual applicant, because the Attorney-General <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> upholding the law for the public benefit.|$|E

5|$|The {{characters}} of Sam and Max {{were created in}} Purcell's youth; Purcell's younger brother Dave originally came up with several comics around {{the idea of a}} dog and rabbit detective duo. Dave would often leave unfinished comics around the house. Deliberately making the characters mix up each other's names, shoot at each other and mock {{the way in which they}} had been drawn, Steve, in a case of sibling rivalry, would sometimes finish the stories in parodies of their original form. This developed from Steve mocking his brother's to the creation of his own stories with the characters. In the late 1970s, Dave Purcell gave Steve the rights to the characters; he signed them over in a contract on Steve's birthday and allowed him to develop the characters in his own way. Purcell believes that his younger brother has recovered and forgiven him from their earlier years. Having kept one as a pet in his youth, Purcell <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> rats, which are commonly featured in his artistic work.|$|E

25|$|The Air Scout Group traces {{its roots}} back to 1925, as the 2nd Canberra (formed 1925) and the 1st Yarralumla Groups merged in 1961 {{to create the}} LaTrobe Park Group, which later became the Air Scouts Group.

25|$|As theorists such as Ronald Coase {{have pointed}} out, all {{business}} organizations represent {{an attempt to}} avoid certain costs associated with doing business. Each is meant to facilitate the contribution of specific resources - investment capital, knowledge, relationships, and so forth - towards a venture which will prove profitable to all contributors. Except for the partnership, all business forms are designed to provide limited liability to both {{members of the organization}} and external investors. Business organizations originated with agency law, which permits an agent to act on behalf of a principal, in exchange for the principal assuming equal liability for the wrongful acts committed by the agent. For this reason, all partners in a typical general partnership may be held liable for the wrongs committed by one partner. Those forms that provide limited liability are able to do so because the state provides a mechanism by which businesses that follow certain guidelines will be able to escape the full liability imposed under agency law. The state provides these forms because it <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the strength of the companies that provide jobs and services therein, but also <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> monitoring and regulating their behavior.|$|E

25|$|In most situations, the {{management}} team {{does not have}} enough money to fund the equity needed for the acquisition (to be combined with bank debt to constitute the purchase price) so that management teams work together with financial sponsors to part-finance the acquisition. For {{the management}} team, the negotiation of the deal with the financial sponsor (i.e., who gets how many shares of the company) is a key value creation lever.

25|$|The {{interests}} objection {{claims that}} what makes murder wrong {{is not just}} the deprivation of a valuable future, but the deprivation of a future that one <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in.</b> The embryo has no conscious interest in its future, and so (the objection concludes) to kill it is not wrong. The defender of Marquis-style arguments may, however, give the counterexample of the suicidal teenager who takes no interest in his or her future, but killing whom is nonetheless wrong and murder. If the opponent responds that one can have an interest in one's future without taking an interest in it, then the defender of the Marquis-style argument can claim that this applies to the embryo. Similarly, if an opponent claims that what is crucial is having a valuable future which one would, under ideal conditions, desire to preserve (whether or not one does in fact desire to preserve it), then the defender may ask why the embryo would not, under ideal conditions, desire to preserve its future.|$|E
