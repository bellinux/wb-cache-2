40|$|OBJECTIVE: To <b>develop</b> <b>review</b> {{criteria}} {{to assess the}} quality of care for three major chronic diseases: adult asthma, stable angina, and non- insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Modified panel process based upon the RAND/UCLA (University College of Los Angeles) appropriateness method. Three multiprofessional panels made up of general practitioners, hospital specialists, and practice nurses. RESULTS: The RAND/UCLA appropriateness method of augmenting evidence with expert opinion was used to develop criteria for the care of the three conditions. Of those aspects of care which were rated as necessary by the panels, only 26 % (16 % asthma, 10 % non-insulin dependent diabetes, 40 % angina) were subsequently rated by the panels as being based on strong scientific evidence. CONCLUSION: The results show the importance of a systematic approach to combining evidence with expert opinion to <b>develop</b> <b>review</b> criteria for assessing the quality of three chronic diseases in general practice. The evidence base for the criteria was often incomplete, and explicit methods need to be used to combine evidence with expert opinion where evidence is not available...|$|E

40|$|While {{multinational}} enterprises (MNEs) {{engage in}} {{various types of}} strategic change, we have a poor understanding of the processes underpinning their decision-making. Using case studies of 9 China-based subsidiaries of MNEs, this paper explores how headquarters (HQ) top management driven subsidiary strategic change decisions in MNEs are made. We identified three decision-making stages for HQ initiated subsidiary strategic changes. In each stage of the decision-making process, HQ management teams' cognitive limitations constrained the effectiveness of decision-making. While headquarters relied on decision-making routines to identify problems and opportunities and to <b>develop,</b> <b>review</b> and sign-off on subsidiary strategic changes, these routines failed to adequately solicit and incorporate the knowledge, information and experience of subsidiary executives. One lesson is for HQ managers to incorporate subsidiary executives more effectively in the strategic change decision-making process for subsidiary level strategic changes...|$|E

40|$|Automation is {{ubiquitous}} in modern complex systems, and commercial nuclear- power plants are no exception. Automation {{is applied to}} a wide range of functions including monitoring and detection, situation assessment, response planning, and response implementation. Automation has become a 'team player' supporting personnel in nearly all aspects of system operation. In light of its increasing use and importance in new- and future-plants, guidance is needed to conduct safety reviews of the operator's interface with automation. The objective of this research was to develop such guidance. We first characterized the important HFE aspects of automation, including six dimensions: levels, functions, processes, modes, flexibility, and reliability. Next, we reviewed literature on the effects of all of these aspects of automation on human performance, and on the design of human-system interfaces (HSIs). Then, we used this technical basis established from the literature to identify general principles for human-automation interaction and to <b>develop</b> <b>review</b> guidelines. The guidelines consist of the following seven topics: automation displays, interaction and control, automation modes, automation levels, adaptive automation, error tolerance and failure management, and HSI integration. In addition, our study identified several topics for additional research...|$|E
40|$|Systematic review has {{developed}} as a specific methodology for searching for, appraising and synthesizing findings of primary studies, and has rapidly become a cornerstone of the evidence-based practice and policy movement. Qualitative research has traditionally been excluded from systematic reviews, and much effort is now being invested in resolving the daunting methodological and epistemological challenges associated with trying to move towards more inclusive forms of review. We describe our experiences, as a very diverse multidisciplinary group, in attempting to incorporate qualitative research in a systematic review of support for breastfeeding. We show how every stage of the review process, from asking the review question through to searching for and sampling the evidence, appraising the evidence and producing a synthesis, provoked profound questions about whether a review that includes qualitative research can remain consistent with the frame offered by current systematic review methodology. We conclude that more debate and dialogue between the different communities that wish to <b>develop</b> <b>review</b> methodology is needed, and that attempts to impose dominant views about the appropriate means of conducting reviews of qualitative research should be resisted so that innovation can be fostered.
