5|$|The Norman chapel in Durham Castle, {{built around}} 1078 by Saxon stonemasons, has what is {{probably}} the earliest surviving artistic depiction of a mermaid in England. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> on a south-facing capital above {{one of the original}} Norman stone pillars.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} k-type section, the image {{impedance}} of the m-type low-pass section is purely real below the cut-off frequency and purely imaginary above it. From the chart <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> {{that in the}} passband the closest impedance match to a constant pure resistance termination occurs at approximately m = 0.6.|$|E

5|$|In Iberia, {{the western}} Mediterranean and {{northwest}} Africa, the common starling may {{be confused with}} the closely related spotless starling, the plumage of which, as its name implies, has a more uniform colour. At close range <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> that the latter has longer throat feathers, a fact particularly noticeable when it sings.|$|E
5|$|According to {{measurements}} {{from the}} Hipparcos astrometric satellite, HD 28185 has a parallax of 23.62 milliarcseconds, which {{corresponds to a}} distance of 42 parsecs (138 light-years). Since the star is located further than 25 parsecs from Earth, it is not listed in the Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars. With an apparent magnitude of 7.81, the star is not visible with the naked eye, though <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> using binoculars.|$|E
5|$|Chaucer's Criseyde is {{swayed by}} Diomedes playing on her fear. Pandarus is now her uncle, more worldly-wise and {{more active in}} what happens and so Troilus is more passive. This {{passivity}} is given comic treatment when Troilus passes out in Criseyde's bedroom and is lifted into her bed by Pandarus. Troilus' repeated emotional paralysis is {{comparable to that of}} Hamlet who may have been based on him. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as driven by loyalty both to Criseyde and to his homeland, but has also been interpreted less kindly.|$|E

5|$|Insular art is {{the name}} given to the common style that {{developed}} in Britain and Ireland from the eighth century and which became highly influential in continental Europe {{and contributed to the}} development of Romanesque and Gothic styles. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> in elaborate jewellery, often making extensive use of semi-precious stones, in the heavily carved high crosses found particularly in the Highlands and Islands, but distributed across the country and particularly in the highly decorated illustrated manuscripts such as the Book of Kells, which may have been begun, or wholly created at the monastic centre of Iona.|$|E
5|$|Lightning is an {{electrical}} discharge {{that occurs in}} a thunderstorm. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> {{in the form of}} a bright streak (or bolt) from the sky. Lightning occurs when {{an electrical}} charge is built up within a cloud, due to static electricity generated by supercooled water droplets colliding with ice crystals near the freezing level. When a large enough charge is built up, a large discharge will occur and can be seen as lightning.|$|E
5|$|Oscar Hammerstein's {{commitment}} to idealizing and encouraging tolerance theatrically started with his libretto to Show Boat. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> {{in his later}} works, {{many of which were}} set to music by Richard Rodgers. Carmen Jones is an attempt to present a modern version of the classic French opera through the experiences of African Americans during wartime, and South Pacific explores interracial marriage and prejudice. Finally, The King andI deals with different cultures' preconceived notions regarding each other and the possibility for cultural inclusiveness in societies.|$|E

50|$|The Theatre of the Ridiculous {{became a}} strong {{influence}} on 1970s culture. Elements of <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> in glam rock, disco, and most directly in the Rocky Horror sub-culture. Since then, the genre has broken out into more mainstream theatrical productions, such as Bat Boy, Urinetown, and Reefer Madness.|$|R
5|$|The {{number of}} {{resonators}} in the expression {{corresponds to the}} number of passbands required. Lowpass and highpass filters can be viewed as special cases of the resonator expression with {{one or the other of}} the terms becoming zero as appropriate. Bandstop filters can be regarded as a combination of a lowpass and a highpass filter. Multiple bandstop filters can always be expressed in terms of a multiple bandpass filter. In this way <b>it,</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> that this transformation represents the general case for any bandform, and all the other transformations are to be viewed as special cases of it.|$|E
5|$|The poem {{is part of}} the Fair Youth {{sequence}} (which comprises sonnets 1–126 in {{the accepted}} numbering stemming from the first edition in 1609). It is also the first of the cycle after the opening sequence now described as the procreation sonnets. Some scholars, however, contend that it {{is part of the}} procreation sonnets, as it addresses the idea of reaching eternal life through the written word, a theme they find in sonnets 15–17. In this view, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as part of a transition to sonnet 20's time theme.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} {{prevalent}} in most woodland types in its range, {{and also in}} more open country with scattered trees. Eurasian sparrowhawks prefer to hunt the edges of wooded areas, but migrant birds {{can be seen in}} any habitat. The increased proportion of medium-aged stands of trees created by modern forestry techniques have benefited Accipiter nisus, according to a Norwegian study. Unlike its larger relative the northern goshawk, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> in gardens and in urban areas and will even breed in city parks.|$|E

5|$|Art in Medieval Scotland {{includes}} {{all forms of}} artistic production within the modern borders of Scotland, between the fifth century and {{the adoption of the}} Renaissance in the early sixteenth century. In the early Middle Ages, there were distinct material cultures evident in the different federations and kingdoms within what is now Scotland. Pictish art was the only uniquely Scottish Medieval style; <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> in the extensive survival of carved stones, particularly in the north and east of the country, which hold a variety of recurring images and patterns. It can also be seen in elaborate metal work that largely survives in buried hoards. Irish-Scots art from the kingdom of Dál Riata suggests {{that it was one of}} the places, as a crossroads between cultures, where the Insular style developed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the night}} sky, Betelgeuse {{is easy to}} spot {{with the naked eye}} owing to its {{distinctive}} orange-red color. In the Northern Hemisphere, beginning in January of each year, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> rising in the east just after sunset. By mid-September to mid-March (best in mid-December), it is visible to virtually every inhabited region of the globe, except for a few research stations in Antarctica at latitudes south of 82°. In May (moderate northern latitudes) or June (southern latitudes), the red supergiant can be seen briefly on the western horizon after sunset, reappearing again a few months later on the eastern horizon before sunrise. In the intermediate period (June–July) it is invisible to the naked eye (visible only with a telescope in daylight), unless around midday (when the Sun is below horizon) on Antarctic regions between 70° and 80° south latitude.|$|E
5|$|Manning {{attended}} Isidore Newman School in New Orleans, Louisiana, and led their {{football team}} to a 34–5 record during his three seasons as the starter. He was named Gatorade Circle of Champions National Player-of-the-Year and Columbus (Ohio) Touchdown Club National Offensive Player-of-the-Year in 1993. While at Newman, he began wearing the #18 jersey {{in honor of his}} older brother Cooper, who was forced to give up football due to spinal stenosis. Younger brother Eli also wore the number when he became starting quarterback. Newman has since retired the #18 jersey and <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> hanging in the school gym. Manning was among the most sought after high school players in the country and was recruited by about 60 colleges, led by Florida, Florida State, LSU, Michigan, Tennessee, Texas, Texas A, and his father's alma mater, Ole Miss.|$|E
