40|$|Most cells must grow {{before they}} can divide, {{but it is not}} known how cells {{determine}} when they have grown enough so they can commit to a new round of cell division. Several parameters affect the timing of initiation <b>of</b> division: cell <b>size</b> at birth, the size cells have to reach when they commit to division, and how fast they reach that size. We report that Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants in metabolic and biosynthetic pathways differ in these variables, controlling the timing of initiation of cell division in various ways. Some mutants affect the size at birth, <b>size</b> at initiation <b>of</b> division, the rate <b>of</b> increase in <b>size,</b> or any combination of the above.

In this study we investigate how the spatial separation of the two conflictive aggregation spots affect the cooperation behaviour. The swarms are controlled by the BEECLUST algorithm, which is a robot control algorithm inspired by honeybee behaviour. We found that the spatial separation of the optima {{does not affect the}} aggregation <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> swarm <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> 9 individuals or more. In contrast smaller cooperating swarms take advantage in their aggregation efficiency. Heterogeneous swarms are a big challenge in swarm robotics.

Then efficiency enhancement by cooperation and the exploitation of side effects are a successful recipe for developing swarm intelligent algorithms. ...|$|R
