40|$|Conservation areas, {{both public}} and private, are {{critical}} tools to protect biodiversity and deliver important ecosystem services (ES) to society. Although societal benefits from such ES are increasingly used to promote public support of conservation, the number <b>of</b> <b>beneficiaries,</b> their <b>identity,</b> and the magnitude of benefits are largely unknown {{for the vast majority}} of conservation areas in the United States public-private conservation network. The location of conservation areas in relation to people strongly influences the direction and magnitude of ES flows as well as the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>beneficiaries.</b> We analyzed benefit zones, the areas to which selected ES could be conveyed to beneficiaries, to assess who benefits from a typical conservation network. Better knowledge of ES flows and beneficiaries will help land conservationists make a stronger case for the broad collateral benefits of conservation and help to address issues of social-environmental justice. To evaluate who benefits the most from the current public-private conservation network, we delineated the benefit zones for local ES (within 16 km) that are conveyed along hydrological paths from public (federal and state) and private (easements) conservation lands in the states of North Carolina and Virginia, USA. We also discuss the challenges and demonstrate an approach for delineating nonhydrological benefits that are passively conveyed to beneficiaries. We mapped and compared the geographic distribution of benefit zones within and among conservation area types. We further compared beneficiary demographics across benefit zones of the conservation area types and found that hydrological benefit zones of federal protected areas encompass disproportionately fewer minority beneficiaries compared to statewide demographic patterns. In contrast, benefit zones of state protected areas and private easements encompassed a much greater proportion <b>of</b> minority <b>beneficiaries</b> (~ 22 - 25 %). Benefit zones associated with private conservation lands included <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>of</b> significantly greater household income than benefit zones of other types of conservation areas. Our analysis of ES flows revealed significant socioeconomic gaps in how the current public-private conservation network benefits the public. These gaps warrant consideration in regional conservation plans and suggest that private conservation initiatives may be best suited for responding to the equity challenge. Enhancing the ecosystem benefits and the equity of benefit delivery from private conservation networks could build public and political support for long-term conservation strategies and ultimately enhance conservation efficacy...|$|R
40|$|Scholarship on post-apartheid {{land reform}} {{includes}} research on land claims made to formal protected areas, such as {{national parks and}} state game reserves. Little attention has however, {{been paid to the}} question of land restitution claims on private lands, on which a range of nominally ‘conservation-friendly’ land-uses (including commercial hunting) have taken place. This article traces the emergence of the ‘community game farm’ as a product of land reform processes affecting freehold land in the midlands of KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa. Two groups <b>of</b> land <b>beneficiaries</b> who were granted title to former privately owned game farms used for leisure hunting are studied in detail. The article shows that a range of state and private actors, as well as traditional authorities, have worked to ensure the continuation of the land under conservation or game farming after transfer. The central argument is that in this process, a generic narrative is imposed which works to conflate or deny the distinct historical <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> the <b>beneficiary</b> groups. The article raises questions about the real efficacy of land restitution in this context, as well as the appropriateness of a community-based conservation narrative when applied in the context of small farms such as those considered here.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, both the health-care professions and the {{pharmaceutical}} industry have revised the codes governing their interaction. These adjustments were responses to changing public standards and to data demonstrating the adverse impact of such interactions on prescribing behaviour and on health spending. Now the relationships between health professions and industry are more tightly regulated than ever before. They’re characterised by a commitment to transparency and to processes that avoid conflicts of interest – more {{than at any time}} in the past. Perhaps the two most significant sets of guidelines governing interaction between doctors and {{the pharmaceutical industry}} - the Royal Australasian College of Physician’s “Guidelines for relationships between physicians and industry” and the “Code of Conduct” of Medicines Australia (the peak industry group for the pharmaceutical industry) – are currently under review. It’s clear that each body will likely introduce incremental changes to the way relationships are managed in the health sector. Sadly, incremental variations achieve little and what we need is fundamental change to the ways in which medicine and medical professionals interact with industry. And despite the progress to date, promotional activities continue, often under the guise of education. Marketing data remain generally aggregated, obscuring the <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> the <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>of</b> industry support. NHMR...|$|R

This {{paper is}} an {{investigation}} into the relative importance {{of a wide variety of}} factors in influencing whether members of the American public support or oppose the use of biotechnology in agriculture and food production. To accomplish this end, as well as to facilitate the examination of a large number of independent variables simultaneously, several statistical methods, including factor analyses, instrumental variables analysis, and probit and logistic regressions were performed. It was determined that people’s perceptions of risks and moral acceptability were important contributors to opinion formation in this regard. The effects of expected benefits, feelings of trust in information, and knowledge about biotechnology and genetics, were also investigated and found to exert varying levels of influence depending on the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> the expected <b>beneficiary</b> or information source, as well as the kind of knowledge under consideration.

40|$|We {{measure a}} {{specific}} form of other-regarding behavior, costly cooperation with an anonymous other, among 645 subjects at a trucker training {{program in the}} Midwestern US. Using subjects' second-mover strategy in a sequential form of the Prisoners' Dilemma, we categorize subjects as: Free Rider, Conditional Cooperator, and Unconditional Cooperator. We observe the subjects on the job {{for up to two}} years afterwards in two naturally-occurring choices 2 ̆ 013 whether to send two types of satellite uplink messages from their trucks. The first identifies trailers requiring repair, which benefits fellow drivers, while the second benefits the experimenters by giving them some follow-up data. Because of the specific nature of the technology and job conditions (which we carefully review) each of these otherwise situationally similar field decisions represents an act of costly cooperation towards an anonymous other in a setting that does not admit of repeated-game or reputation-effect explanations. We find that individual differences in costly cooperation observed in the lab do predict individual differences in the field in the first choice but not the second. We suggest that this difference is linked to the difference in the social <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> the <b>beneficiaries</b> (fellow drivers versus experimenters), and we conjecture that whether or not individual variations in pro-sociality generalize across settings (whether in the lab or field) may depend in part on this specific contextual factor: whether the social identities, and the relevant prescriptions (or norms) linked to them that are salient for subjects (as in Akerlof and Kranton (2000); (2010)), are appropriately parallel...|$|R

40|$|There {{is by now}} ample {{evidence}} from laboratory experiments that individuals exhibit "prosocial" or "other-regarding" preferences. However, a key {{question is whether the}} importance of other-regarding preferences documented in the laboratory can be readily generalized to draw conclusions about the importance of such preferences outside the laboratory, where markedly different conditions often apply (for instance, differences in stakes; differences in the level of anonymity and scrutiny; etc). In this paper we address this question by using a measure of costly cooperation elicited in a laboratory experiment to predict the cooperative behaviours that the same individuals exhibit in comparable, naturally-occurring, social situations outside the laboratory. In this Nottingham School of Economics working paper, Daniele Nosenzo and co-authors conducted laboratory experiments with 645 subjects at a trucker training program in the Midwestern US. The experiment use a version of the prisoner's dilemma game to measure subjects' preferences for cooperation. The authors observe the same subjects on the job for up to two years afterwards in two naturally-occurring choices - whether to send two types of satellite uplink messages from their trucks. The first identifies trailers requiring repair, which benefits fellow drivers, while the second benefits the experimenters by giving them some follow-up data.

To achieve this, a review of the existing literature was done to have an initial understanding <b>of</b> <b>beneficiary</b> involvement. During our literature review, we identified six progressive levels of involvement which include: information sharing, listening and learning, joint assessment, shared decision-making, collaboration and empowerment.  Based on this literature review, we suggested a framework for managing beneficiary involvement.   In addition, we conducted a multiple case study and collected data from five different cases through interviews. Our respondents were professionals with several years of experience in developing and implementing development projects which are aimed at improving the livelihood of vulnerable communities. Through the analysis of the empirical findings, we got new insights on how the process <b>of</b> <b>beneficiary</b> involvement is managed.
