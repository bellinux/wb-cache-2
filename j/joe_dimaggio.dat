5|$|A {{baseball}} field in Fresno named after Chance operated from 1935 to 1941. <b>Joe</b> <b>DiMaggio</b> {{played in the}} first-ever game at Frank Chance Field. Retired players participated in an exhibition game in Chance's honor in 1937. John McGraw, a contemporary and rival of Chance, considered Chance {{one of the greatest}} players he ever saw.|$|E
5|$|Several Yankees hold AL and MLB records. Ruth has MLB single-season {{records for}} extra-base hits and total bases, and holds four other AL single-season records. Outfielder <b>Joe</b> <b>DiMaggio</b> {{recorded}} hits in 56 consecutive {{games in the}} 1941 season, a total that remains an MLB record. Jack Chesbro holds three AL records that he set in 1904: games won, games started, and complete games.|$|E

5|$|The Yankees {{sought to}} develop their own players, rather than buying them from other teams, {{especially}} after the investment of $100,000 ($ in current dollar terms) in Lyn Lary and Jimmie Reese in 1927. However, Weiss and Bill Essick convinced Barrow to approve the purchase of <b>Joe</b> <b>DiMaggio</b> from the Pacific Coast League.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, {{he managed}} {{in the minor}} leagues for five seasons, {{retiring}} to Lincolnwood, Illinois in 1946. On January 26, 1955, Hartnett was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame along with <b>Joe</b> <b>DiMaggio,</b> Ted Lyons and Dazzy Vance. In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included Hartnett in their book The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time. In 1999, he was named as a finalist to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.|$|E
5|$|Monroe's troubled {{private life}} {{received}} much attention. She struggled with substance abuse, depression, and anxiety. She had two highly publicized marriages, to retired baseball star <b>Joe</b> <b>DiMaggio</b> and playwright Arthur Miller, {{both of which}} ended in divorce. On August 5, 1962, she died at age 36 from an overdose of barbiturates {{at her home in}} Los Angeles. Although Monroe's death was ruled a probable suicide, several conspiracy theories have been proposed in the decades following her death.|$|E

5|$|Stengel was {{introduced}} as Yankee manager on October 12, 1948, the 25th {{anniversary of his}} second World Series home run to beat the Yankees. <b>Joe</b> <b>DiMaggio</b> attended the press conference {{as a sign of}} team support. Stengel faced obstacles to being accepted—Harris had been popular with the press and public, and the businesslike Yankee corporate culture and successful tradition were thought to be ill matched with a manager who had the reputation of a clown and who had never had a major league team finish in {{the top half of the}} standings. Stengel's MLB involvement had been in the National League, and there were several American League parks in which he had neither managed nor played.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees won the World Series {{every year}} from 1936 to 1939 with a team that {{featured}} Gehrig and outfielder <b>Joe</b> <b>DiMaggio,</b> who recorded a record hitting streak during New York's 1941 championship season. New York set a major league record by winning five consecutive championships from 1949 to 1953, and appeared in the World Series nine times from 1955 to 1964. Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, and Whitey Ford were among the players fielded by the Yankees during the era. After the 1964 season, a lack of effective replacements for aging players caused the franchise to decline on the field, and the team became a money-loser for owners CBS while playing in an aging stadium.|$|E
5|$|An avid golfer {{and tennis}} player, Graham partnered with New York Yankees great <b>Joe</b> <b>DiMaggio</b> in {{numerous}} golf tournaments later in life. He retired {{to a house}} {{on a golf course}} in Florida. Graham overcame colon cancer in 1977, but was later plagued by heart ailments and other health problems. He was diagnosed as being {{in the early stages of}} Alzheimer's disease in 2001, and died of a heart aneurysm in Sarasota, Florida, on December 17, 2003. He had two sons and a daughter with his wife Beverly. In 2013, Northwestern's fundraising department created The Otto Graham Society to honor his achievements at the school and support its athletics programs. In 2014, a new gymnasium at Waterford Country School was dedicated to Otto Graham's memory.|$|E

5|$|Five Cardinals {{were named}} to the All-Star Game in 2003 while Pujols led the NL in votes. It {{was the first of}} eight {{straight}} seasons that Pujols would reach the All-Star Game. From July 12 to August 16, Pujols had a 30-game hitting streak, tied for the second-longest in Cardinals' history with Musial and behind only Rogers Hornsby's 33-game streak. On July 20, Pujols hit his 100th career home run, a game-winner in a 10–7 victory over the Dodgers. He became the fourth major leaguer to hit his 100th home run in his third season, along with Ralph Kiner, Eddie Mathews, and <b>Joe</b> <b>DiMaggio.</b> Pujols hit his 114th home run on September 20 in a game against the Astros, which tied him with Kiner for most home runs by a player in his first three seasons.|$|E
5|$|Monroe {{was next}} to star in a {{television}} adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's short story Rain for NBC, but the project fell through as the network {{did not want to}} hire her choice of director, Lee Strasberg. Instead of working, she spent {{the first six months of}} 1961 preoccupied by health problems. Monroe underwent surgery for her endometriosis, had a cholecystectomy, and spent four weeks in hospital care – including a brief stint in a mental ward – for depression. She was helped by her ex-husband <b>Joe</b> <b>DiMaggio,</b> with whom she now rekindled a friendship. In spring 1961, Monroe also moved back to California after six years on the East Coast. She dated Frank Sinatra for several months, and in early 1962 purchased a house in Brentwood, Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|The Indians hired Bill McKechnie as a {{pitching}} coach after the 1946 season. One {{of his first}} jobs was to work with Gromek during the offseason and improve his pitching due to his struggles the prior year, in particular against left-handed batters. The Indians talked with the Yankees during the offseason about making a trade for second baseman Joe Gordon. The teams settled on Gromek as the main piece originally, but <b>Joe</b> <b>DiMaggio</b> suggested the team trade for Reynolds instead. Gromek remained on the Indians for the 1947 season as a result, but {{was moved to the}} bullpen instead of remaining in the starting rotation. The highlight of his season came on July 1 in relief of Feller, who left the game due to injury. In the game against the Browns, he threw 7.2 innings and allowed two runs in a 9–3 victory in what was his longest appearance of the season at that time. For the year, Gromek pitched in 29 games, starting 7, and had a 2–5 record and a 3.74 ERA in 84.1 innings pitched, his first full season in which he pitched under 150 innings.|$|E
5000|$|Unitas was {{inducted}} into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1979 and his record 47-consecutive-game touchdown passes is a record compared to <b>Joe</b> <b>DiMaggio's</b> 56-game hitting streak. (Drew Brees broke the record in 2012.) ...|$|R
50|$|Daniel was {{official}} scorer {{for more}} than twenty games during <b>Joe</b> <b>DiMaggio's</b> 1941 hitting streak. His decisions are still criticized more than 60 years later, but Daniel maintained throughout his life that he called each play as he saw it.|$|R
5000|$|According to Star Trek: Voyager, in 2032 the New York Yankees {{will win}} the World Series in 6 games, beating an yet-to-be {{established}} team called the Kings. Also, <b>Joe</b> <b>DiMaggio's</b> 56-game hitting streak will be broken by a Kings hitter in Game 5.|$|R
5|$|In the 2010 NLCS against Philadelphia, Rentería {{reclaimed}} {{a starting}} role {{when he started}} four games (the Giants benched third baseman Pablo Sandoval and shifted Uribe to third base). He only had one hit in the series, but he scored the winning run in the Giants' 3–0 victory in Game 3, and he retained the starting job in the World Series. In Game 2 of the series, against the Texas Rangers, he broke a scoreless tie in the fifth inning when he homered off C. J. Wilson to give the Giants a 1–0 lead. He later added a two-run single {{in the eighth inning}} as the Giants won 9–0. Before Game 5, with the Giants leading the series 3–1, Rentería joked with teammate Andrés Torres {{that he was going to}} hit a home run. In the seventh inning, with runners at second and third, two outs, and no score, Rentería hit a three-run home run off Rangers' pitcher Cliff Lee that won the series for the Giants. The feat made him only the fourth player to have two series-winning hits in history, along with Yogi Berra, <b>Joe</b> <b>DiMaggio,</b> and Lou Gehrig. For his contributions, he was named the 2010 World Series Most Valuable Player, making him the first player from Colombia to achieve this feat. The Giants declined his option on November 5, but Rentería did announce that he planned to play in 2011. The Giants did offer him a one-year, one million dollar contract as a utility player, but Rentería declined.|$|E
25|$|Through 2011, Williams was one {{of seven}} major league players to {{have had at least}} four 30-home run and 100-RBI seasons in their first five years, along with Chuck Klein, <b>Joe</b> <b>DiMaggio,</b> Ralph Kiner, Mark Teixeira, Albert Pujols, and Ryan Braun.|$|E
25|$|The five-year {{waiting period}} was {{established}} in 1954 after an evolutionary process. In 1936 all players were eligible, including active ones. From the 1937 election until the 1945 election, there was no waiting period, so any retired player was eligible, but writers were discouraged from voting for current major leaguers. Since there was no formal rule preventing a writer from casting a ballot for an active player, the scribes did not always comply with the informal guideline; <b>Joe</b> <b>DiMaggio</b> received a vote in 1945, for example. From the 1946 election until the 1954 election, an official one-year waiting period was in effect. (DiMaggio, for example, retired after the 1951 season and was first eligible in the 1953 election.) The modern rule establishing a wait of five years was passed in 1954, although an exception was made for <b>Joe</b> <b>DiMaggio</b> because of his high level of previous support, thus permitting him to be elected within four years of his retirement.|$|E
5000|$|This {{year was}} noted for a [...] "changing of the guard" [...] for the Yankees, {{as it was}} <b>Joe</b> <b>DiMaggio's</b> final season and Mickey Mantle's first. The 1951 season also marked {{the first year of}} Bob Sheppard's long tenure as Yankee Stadium's public address announcer.|$|R
50|$|Preacher Roe {{pitched a}} six-hit shutout, getting the only run he needed early when Jackie Robinson doubled and Gil Hodges singled. Yankee Stadium came {{alive in the}} ninth with <b>Joe</b> <b>DiMaggio's</b> leadoff hit, but Roe retired the next three Yankees for the win, the second {{straight}} 1-0 result of the Series.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the wake}} of former New York Yankees player <b>Joe</b> <b>DiMaggio's</b> death on March8, 1999, Governor George Pataki {{proposed}} renaming the Deegan Expressway to the [...] "Joe DiMaggio Highway". However, New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani favored renaming the West Side Highway for DiMaggio instead. Pataki agreed to Giuliani's proposal one week later.|$|R
25|$|With Al Lang's support, {{the city}} {{replaced}} Coffee Pot Park with St. Petersburg Athletic Park (also known as Waterfront Park) {{on the present}} site of Al Lang Stadium in 1923. It served as the spring training home for Major League Baseball teams the Boston Braves and the New York Yankees until after World War II, hosting baseball greats such as Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, <b>Joe</b> <b>DiMaggio,</b> and Stan Musial.|$|E
25|$|The Giants {{went on to}} {{meet the}} New York Yankees in the 1951 World Series. In Game 1, Mays, Hank Thompson and Hall of Famer Monte Irvin {{comprised}} the first all-African-American outfield in major league history {{four years after the}} color line was broken. Mays hit poorly while the Giants lost the series 4-2. The six-game set was the only time that Mays and retiring Yankee ace <b>Joe</b> <b>DiMaggio</b> would compete against each other.|$|E
25|$|On August 18, 1945, {{when the}} war ended, Lt. Williams was sent to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. While in Pearl Harbor, Williams played {{baseball}} in the Army League. Also in that eight-team league were <b>Joe</b> <b>DiMaggio,</b> Joe Gordon, and Stan Musial. The Service World Series with the Army versus the Navy attracted crowds of 40,000 for each game. The players said it was even better than the actual World Series being played between the Detroit Tigers and Chicago Cubs that year.|$|E
50|$|In an eight-season career, Milnar {{posted a}} 57-58 record with 350 strikeouts and a 4.18 ERA in 1043 innings pitched, {{including}} 127 starts, 49 complete games, 10 shutouts and seven saves. Milnar is notable for {{giving up the}} single that extended <b>Joe</b> <b>DiMaggio's</b> hitting streak to 56 games at League Park in 1941.|$|R
