5|$|Vainio's friends Heikki Kauppinen and Reijo Tani quit {{drinking}} in 1972, {{and at first}} Vainio found their decision odd. When Vexi Salmi was hired by Fazer in 1970, Vainio and Salmi started drinking together often and sometimes <b>even</b> <b>came</b> to work with hangovers. On one occasion, Vainio forgot that {{he was supposed to}} have finished the text of an advertising tune. When the deadline arrived, Vainio was too hung over to finish the lyrics and eventually Salmi agreed to help by writing the lyrics for Vainio's composition. Vainio's alcohol use increased in the 1970s, and his parents watched without being able to do anything about it. It is reported that Vainio would not go to sleep at night unless he had liquor under his bed, and he always kept a bottle with him. Vainio began to realize that he could not live like this forever. By summer 1975 he decided that he needed to stop drinking altogether. He was especially helped in this decision through his meeting footballer Kai Pahlman, who told Vainio that he was surprised he was still alive. In late 1975, Vainio stayed sober for four months, but then caved in for a short time. In January 1976 he finally managed to {{quit drinking}} for good.|$|E

25|$|Stassen {{was later}} {{best known for}} being a {{perennial}} candidate for the Republican Party nomination for President of the United States, seeking it nine times between 1944 and 1992 (1944, 1948, 1952, 1964, 1968, 1980, 1984, 1988, and 1992). He never won the Republican nomination, much less the presidency; in fact, after 1952, he never <b>even</b> <b>came</b> close, but continued to campaign actively and seriously for President until just a year before his death.|$|E

25|$|Whoever he was, Abu Muslim built {{a secret}} network of pro-Abbasid {{sentiment}} based among the mixed Arab and Iranian military officers along the Silk Road garrison cities. Through this networking, Abu Muslim ensured armed {{support for the}} Abbasids from a multi-ethnic force years before the revolution <b>even</b> <b>came</b> out in the open. These networks proved essential, as the officers garrisoned along the Silk Road had spent years fighting the ferocious Turkic tribes of Central Asia and were experienced and respected tacticians and warriors.|$|E
25|$|The provincial riding of York South—Weston, which {{corresponds}} {{closely to}} {{the boundaries of the}} federal riding, {{at the time of the}} by-election was considered a Liberal stronghold.

After Rae resigned from the Legislature, the only NDP candidate that <b>even</b> <b>came</b> close to a victory was David Miller (currently Toronto's mayor, at the time a Metro councillor for Ward One), in the 1996 by-election.|$|E
25|$|In June, Burmese Days was {{published}} and Cyril Connolly's {{review in the}} New Statesman prompted Orwell (as he then became known) to re-establish contact with his old friend. In August, he moved into a flat in Kentish Town, which he shared with Michael Sayers and Rayner Heppenstall. The relationship was sometimes awkward and Orwell and Heppenstall <b>even</b> <b>came</b> to blows, though they remained friends and later worked together on BBC broadcasts. Orwell was now working on Keep the Aspidistra Flying, and also tried unsuccessfully to write a serial for the News Chronicle. By October 1935 his flatmates had moved out and he was struggling {{to pay the rent}} on his own. He remained until the end of January 1936, when he stopped working at Booklovers' Corner.|$|E

25|$|Hugh's {{power in}} Italy was damaged but not {{destroyed}} by these events. To strengthen {{his hand in}} the affairs of Milan, he tonsured his younger illegitimate son, Tebald, to groom him for the position of Archbishop of Milan; however, the ancient cleric, Arderic, whom he installed pro tem lived another twenty-two years. He continued to organise the fight against the Magyars and the Andalusian pirates based at Fraxinet in Provence. Active, if sometimes dubious, diplomacy paid off. He concluded a treaty with Rudolph in 933 by which Rudolf abandoned his claims to Italy in return for being handed Provence over the heads of Louis the Blind's heirs and the marriage of Rudolph's daughter Adelaide to Hugh's son Lothair. Friendly relations were maintained with the Byzantine Empire and, in 942, Hugh <b>even</b> <b>came</b> to terms with Alberic, who married one of Hugh's daughters.|$|E
25|$|In {{the tournament}} quarterfinals Royce and Sakuraba battled {{for an hour}} and a half (six 15 minute rounds). Gracie opened the fight aggressively, raining punches from Kazushi's back while the Japanese worked an armlock from standing, but Sakuraba kept calm, knowing Royce had no {{knockout}} power and expecting him to waste his energy; he <b>even</b> <b>came</b> to the point of smiling to the cameras during the attack (Sakuraba went on later to claim that he was actually greeting a cameraman who was a personal friend of his). Towards the end of the round, Sakuraba nearly ended the match with a kneebar, while Gracie came back with a guillotine choke at the second, but Kazushi again joked to show he was out of danger by simulating to pull down Royce's gi pants. Sakuraba switched to attack at the third round, dominating the stand up and making Royce lie repeatedly on the ground to avoid him. As the confrontation stretched on, the Gracie's own no time-limit rules began to work against Royce as Sakuraba's wrestling skills and balance nullified Royce's ability to score a takedown and—in some instances—even pull guard. Even Royce's ever-present jiu-jitsu gi became a weapon for the wrestler to use against him as Sakuraba used it to help him control Gracie on the instances the fight did come to the ground. However, with Sakuraba's control of the takedown, these instances of ground warfare became increasingly sporadic. After Kazushi landed a long series of punishing leg kicks at the fifth and sixth rounds, Royce's brother, Rorion threw in the towel.|$|E
500|$|The Nintendo DS {{is said to}} have {{influenced}} the Wii's design. Designer Ken'ichiro Ashida noted, [...] "We had the DS on our minds as we worked on the Wii.

[...] The idea was eventually rejected because of the notion that the two gaming systems would be identical. Miyamoto also stated, [...] " [...] if the DS had flopped, we might have taken the Wii back to the drawing board." [...] In June 2011 Nintendo unveiled the prototype of its successor to the Wii, to be known as Wii U.|$|E

There were rumors that Grant himself was {{involved}} with the ring and was diverting its profits to his 1872 re-election campaign. Grant needed to clear his own name as well as Babcock's. [...] Earlier, Grant had refused to believe Babcock was guilty even when Bristow and Wilson personally presented him with damaging evidence, such as two telegrams signed [...] "Sylph"; Babcock suggested that the signature was that of a woman giving the president [...] "a great deal of trouble", hoping that Wilson would back off for fear of igniting a presidential sex scandal, but Wilson was not bluffed.|$|E

The names were meant to be different, which Balliett considered [...] "fun for a child." [...] Balliett felt that she could capture the attention of reluctant readers if they related to characters who enjoyed writing and math. Calder and Petra's teacher, Ms. Hussey, was inspired by an old name on Nantucket Island and the old-fashioned word [...] Balliett compares herself to Ms. Hussey, stating that [...] " [...] think a lot alike."

[...] Reichel had one-timed a pass from Theoren Fleury on a 3-on-1 when McLean threw out both his pads to make the stop and preserve the series. [...] With McLean out of position and Reichel having had an open net to shoot at, the red light <b>even</b> <b>came</b> on at the Olympic Saddledome to signal a goal.

According to Keikavus, his host was [...] "a great king, a man firm and clever, [...] just, courageous, eloquent dialectician, of pure faith and far-sighted". This estimate was shared by the Byzantines, for Skylitzes likewise calls him [...] "as clever a strategist as anybody else, capable of thwarting the enemies' tactics and policies", while Münejjim Bashi writes that after his takeover of Ganja, [...] "Abu'l-Aswar [...] restored the name of the dynasty to life after it had nearly died out.

500|$|Falk soon {{proved himself}} to be a capable agent with many {{innovative}} marketing ideas. [...] He allowed Nike to establish Jordan's primary image, then began splitting it up among other advertisers, including Coca-Cola, Chevrolet, Gatorade, McDonald's, Ball Park Franks, Wilson Sporting Goods, Rayovac, Wheaties, Hanes, and MCI. [...] Falk's ideas stretched to all areas of the marketplace, including a fragrance (called simply [...] "Michael Jordan") made by the Beverly Hills designer Bijan, which was cited as the best-marketed product of 1996 by the American Marketing Association. [...] Falk <b>even</b> <b>came</b> {{up with the idea of}} teaming Bugs Bunny and Jordan together in a feature film, and then sold the concept to Warner Bros. in 1993. [...] The ensuing film, Space Jam, was executive produced by Falk and released in 1996. [...] Perhaps most importantly, Falk [...] "set a precedent by 'opting out' Jordan from the league's licensing program, in effect reclaiming Jordan's image for his own use." [...] Jordan himself was very grateful for his agent's remarkable negotiating and marketing abilities, even with Falk's penchant for making powerful enemies along the way.|$|E
