25|$|Heterojunction {{transistors}} {{have different}} semiconductors for {{the elements of}} the transistor. Usually the emitter is composed of a larger bandgap material than the base. The figure shows that this difference in bandgap allows the barrier for holes to inject backward from the base into the emitter, denoted in the figure as Δφp, to be made large, while the barrier for electrons to inject into the base Δφn is made low. This barrier arrangement helps reduce minority carrier injection from the base when the emitter-base junction is under <b>forward</b> <b>bias,</b> and thus reduces base current and increases emitter injection efficiency.|$|E

2500|$|However, if the {{polarity}} of {{the external}} voltage opposes the built-in potential, recombination can once again proceed, resulting in a substantial electric current through the p–n junction (i.e. substantial numbers of electrons and holes recombine at the junction). For silicon diodes, the built-in potential is approximately 0.7 V (0.3 V for germanium and 0.2 V for Schottky). Thus, if an external voltage greater than and opposite to the built-in voltage is applied, a current will flow and the diode {{is said to be}} [...] "turned on" [...] as it has been given an external <b>forward</b> <b>bias.</b> The diode is commonly said to have a forward [...] "threshold" [...] voltage, above which it conducts and below which conduction stops. However, this is only an approximation as the forward characteristic is according to the Shockley equation absolutely smooth (see graph below).|$|E
2500|$|All {{semiconductor}} detectors function rather inefficiently {{in crystal}} receivers, because the low voltage input to the detector {{is too low}} to result in much difference between forward better conduction direction, and the reverse weaker conduction. [...] To improve the sensitivity {{of some of the}} early crystal detectors, such as silicon carbide, a small <b>forward</b> <b>bias</b> voltage was applied across the detector by a battery and potentiometer. [...] The bias moves the diode's operating point higher on the detection curve producing more signal voltage at the expense of less signal current (higher impedance). There is a limit to the benefit that this produces, depending on the other impedances of the radio. [...] This improved sensitivity was caused by moving the DC operating point to a more desirable voltage-current operating point (impedance) on the junction's I-V curve. The battery did not power the radio, but only provided the biasing voltage which required little power.|$|E

This stance is becoming increasingly popular, and is the most resilient of the three. The feet do not actually have to be angled equally outwards to be considered duck stance. [...] The back foot simply has to be angled less than zero degrees. These angles give the rider a dominant front foot angle at all times which {{makes it easier for}} a rider to change the board direction mid-run. This change in board direction mid-run is called riding [...] "Switch" [...] or [...] "Fakie". Duck stance is also very popular for park riders because it gives them the versatility to move their board in all directions.
