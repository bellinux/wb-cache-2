2500|$|Henry Maudslay, {{who trained}} {{a school of}} machine tool makers early in the 19th century, was a {{mechanic}} with superior ability who had been employed at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich. He worked as an apprentice in the Royal Gun Foundry of Jan Verbruggen. In 1774 Jan Verbruggen had installed a <b>horizontal</b> <b>boring</b> <b>machine</b> in Woolwich {{which was the first}} industrial size Lathe in the UK. He was hired away by Joseph Bramah for the production of high security metal locks that required precision craftsmanship. [...] Bramah patented a lathe that had similarities to the slide rest lathe. [...] Maudslay perfected the slide rest lathe, which could cut machine screws of different thread pitches by using changeable gears between the spindle and the lead screw. [...] Before its invention screws could not be cut to any precision using various earlier lathe designs, some of which copied from a template. [...] The slide rest lathe was called one of history's most important inventions, although not entirely Maudslay's idea, he {{was the first person to}} build a functional lathe using a combination of known innovations of the lead screw, slide rest and change gears.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>{{horizontal}}</b> <b>boring</b> <b>machine</b> or horizontal {{boring mill}} is a machine tool which bores holes in a horizontal direction. There are three main types [...] - [...] table, planer and floor. [...] The table type {{is the most common}} and, as it is the most versatile, it is also known as the universal type.|$|E
5000|$|He {{developed}} {{a series of}} increasingly precise <b>horizontal</b> <b>boring</b> <b>machines</b> which culminated in the JIGMIL. This was so accurate {{that it did not}} require expensive jigs and was adopted extensively throughout industry, selling 4,500 units. [...] The first JIGMIL is now in the Henry Ford Museum and Charles DeVlieg has entered the Machine Tool Hall of Fame.|$|R
50|$|<b>Horizontal</b> <b>boring</b> <b>machines</b> {{are often}} {{heavy-duty}} industrial machines used for roughing out large components {{but there are}} high-precision models too. Modern machines use advanced CNC control systems and techniques. Charles DeVlieg entered the Machine Tool Hall of Fame for his work upon a highly precise model which he called a JIGMIL. The accuracy of this machine convinced the USAF to accept John Parson's idea for numerically controlled machine tools.|$|R

At the Royal Brass Foundry they {{introduced}} a <b>horizontal</b> <b>boring</b> <b>machine,</b> for guns cast solid (instead of vertically reaming guns cast round a core); this system had been adopted at The Hague in the 1750s. They also rebuilt the furnaces and casting pits, and used precast moulds for cascabels.|$|E

Products included Naval gun sights and the technically very demanding precision cast wheelhouse for the Rolls-Royce Merlin aero engine.

50|$|The first Master Founder, Andrew Schalch, {{served in}} post for 54 years before {{retiring}} in 1769 {{at the age of}} 78. In 1770 a revolutionary horse-powered <b>horizontal</b> <b>boring</b> <b>machine</b> was installed in the Foundry by his successor, Jan Verbruggen which inspired Henry Maudslay (who worked at the foundry from 1783) to his inventions improving the lathe. Remarkably, it remained in use until 1843 when a steam-powered equivalent replaced it.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>horizontal</b> <b>boring</b> <b>machine</b> has {{its work}} spindle {{parallel}} to the ground and work table. Typically there are three linear axes in which the tool head and part move. Convention dictates that the main axis that drives the part towards the work spindle is the Z axis, with a cross-traversing X axis and a vertically traversing Y axis. The work spindle {{is referred to as the}} C axis and, if a rotary table is incorporated, its centre line is the B axis.|$|E
5000|$|Maudslay {{began work}} {{at the age of}} 12 as a [...] "powder monkey", one of the boys {{employed}} in filling cartridges at the Arsenal. After two years, he was transferred to a carpenter’s shop followed by a blacksmith’s forge, where at the age of fifteen he began training as a blacksmith. He seems to have specialised in the lighter, more complex kind of forge work. During his time at the Arsenal, Maudslay also worked at the Royal Foundry, where Jan Verbruggen had installed an innovative <b>horizontal</b> <b>boring</b> <b>machine</b> in 1772.|$|E

50|$|The {{boring process}} can be {{executed}} on various machine tools, including (1) general-purpose or universal machines, such as lathes (/turning centers) or milling machines (/machining centers), and (2) machines designed to specialize in boring as a primary function, such as jig borers and <b>boring</b> <b>machines</b> or <b>boring</b> mills, which include vertical boring mills (workpiece rotates around a vertical axis while boring bar/head moves linearly; essentially a vertical lathe) and <b>horizontal</b> <b>boring</b> mills (workpiece sits on a table while the boring bar rotates around a horizontal axis; essentially a specialized horizontal milling machine).|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} early lathe in the UK was the <b>horizontal</b> <b>boring</b> <b>machine</b> {{that was}} installed in 1772 in the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich. It was horse-powered and allowed {{for the production of}} much more accurate and stronger cannon used with success in the American Revolutionary War in the late 18th century. One of the key characteristics of this machine was that the workpiece was turning as opposed to the tool, making it technically a lathe (see attached drawing). Henry Maudslay who later developed many improvements to the lathe worked at the Royal Arsenal from 1783 being exposed to this machine in the Verbruggen workshop.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origins of}} the {{cylindrical}} grinder, as with all other modern machine tools, stem from the experimentation and invention of John Wilkinson and later Henry Maudslay who built the first <b>horizontal</b> <b>boring</b> <b>machine</b> and the first engine lathe, respectively. The cylindrical grinder owes much of its development from {{the onset of the}} Industrial Revolution, particularly to the advent of reliable, inexpensive steel production and later the improvement of the grinding wheel. The basis for the modern day cylindrical grinder was first built in the 1830s by two men working independently, Jonathan Bridges and James Wheaton [...] It is unclear as to which man had first produced the machine but both are closely tied to the first historical appearance of the modern day tool. It took another 40 years before further improvement and refinement of the tool occurred.|$|E
50|$|In {{the home}} shop the {{radial arm saw}} is an {{alternative}} to the table saw. Both machines can rip, crosscut, do simple and compound miters, dado, mold or shape, make tenons, make open mortises, taper cut, and rabbet. The radial arm saw requires less clearance or space in the shop to handle long stock, since it only requires clearance on the sides, whereas a table saw needs clearance to the sides, in front and at the back. The radial saw is perfectly efficient backed up against a wall, whereas the table saw needs to be placed {{in the center of the}} shop to give all around clearance. With some accessories the former can be used as a shaper, a disk or drum sander, a grinder, a surface planer, a router, a <b>horizontal</b> <b>boring</b> <b>machine</b> and even as a power unit for a lathe; whereas a table saw's secondary uses are limited to shaper and disk sander. The major shortcoming of most current radial arm saws for home-use is that, most radial arm saws that have been built after the early 1960s are manufactured with stamped sheet metal parts and are machined to loose tolerances, hence they are not precise for doing accurate work without 'tuning'. A high-quality radial arm saw has carefully machined track arm ways and locking mechanisms, and a motor that runs very smoothly; under 'no-load' conditions most of the sound and vibration will originate from the whisper/whistling and the imbalance of the saw blade upon the arbor.|$|E
