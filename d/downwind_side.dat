5|$|This is {{the most}} common type of {{thunderstorm}} development. Mature thunderstorms are found near the center of the cluster, while dissipating thunderstorms exist on their <b>downwind</b> <b>side.</b> Multicell storms form as clusters of storms but may then evolve into one or more squall lines. While each cell of the cluster may only last 20minutes, the cluster itself may persist for hours at a time. They often arise from convective updrafts in or near mountain ranges and linear weather boundaries, such as strong cold fronts or troughs of low pressure. These type of storms are stronger than the single-cell storm, yet much weaker than the supercell storm. Hazards with the multicell cluster include moderate-sized hail, flash flooding, and weak tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|At about 3:30am on Thursday, 25 February, Gothenburg {{continued}} to heel over. The deck became so steep that {{passengers and crew}} had to climb over the rails to get on her side. At about 4:00am, the two remaining starboard lifeboats were lowered and were rushed by the passengers. One starboard lifeboat, crammed with women and children, capsized when others tried to board it. Some half dozen men righted her in the water, but, damaged and without oars, food or water, it quickly drifted away and was never found. The second starboard lifeboat also capsized when the sea crashed over, washing all the occupants into the sea. One passenger recalled the sea on the <b>downwind</b> <b>side</b> of the ship being covered with human heads bobbing {{up and down like}} corks. Five or six men and one woman climbed onto the upturned hull. The boat was still connected to its painter, but it was unable to be recovered from the heavy sea and wind which swept the woman off and drowned her. A passenger, John Cleland, swam to the connected, but upturned lifeboat and further secured it with a rope tied to Gothenburg. In less than fifteen minutes, nearly 100 people had drowned; washed away or trapped in their water-filled cabins. By this time, several sharks were circling the wreck.|$|E
40|$|International audienceComplex {{interactions}} between katabatic winds and the cryosphere {{may lead to}} the formation of sedimentation waves at the surface of ice sheets. These have been first described and named snow megadunes in Antarctica. Here we use topographic data, optical images, subsurface radar soundings and spectroscopic data acquired by Mars orbiters, to show that the surface of the Martian North Polar Cap displays two superimposed sets of sedimentation waves with differing wavelengths. These sedimentation waves have similarities with Antarctic snow megadunes regarding their surface morphology, texture, grain size asymmetry, and internal stratigraphic architecture. Both sets of Martian sedimentation waves present young ice and occasional sastrugi fields, indicative of net accumulation, on their shallow-dipping upwind sides, their tops and the intervening troughs. Old layers of dusty ice, indicative of net ablation, are exhumed on the steep-dipping <b>downwind</b> <b>sides</b> of the larger waves. Smooth surfaces of coarse-grained ice, indicative of reduced accumulation associated with sublimation metamorphism, cover the steep-dipping <b>downwind</b> <b>sides</b> of the smaller waves. These surface characteristics and the internal stratigraphy revealed by radar soundings are consistent with the interpretation that both sets of Martian sedimentation waves grow and migrate upwind in response to the development of periodic accumulation/ablation patterns controlled by katabatic winds. The recognition of these sedimentation waves provides the basis {{for the development of a}} common model of ice/wind interaction at the surface of Martian and terrestrial glaciers.

Besides the dolphin flight path for vertical screening of the boundary layer, a mapping flight path at 150 m above ground was employed. The meteorological conditions severely limited the interpretability of the data sets in many cases. We found those data that were gained during conditions with a stable boundary layer can not be utilized for emission flux computations or trend analyses. Also, in cases with a neutrally stratified or convective boundary layer, the data sets were of complex structure which hindered the application of parametric statistical tools. Therefore, any meaningful emission fluxes could not be decuded from data sets that were measured in short distance to the emission sources.

40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{performance of}} the low solidity curved-bladed Darrieus {{vertical axis wind turbine}} has been studied both theoretically and experimentally. Initial studies showed the need for an engineering prediction scheme sufficiently accurate to give blade forces as functions of rotational position which did not require excessive computational time. The scheme proposed here develops a suggestion first made by Lapin in 1975, to treat the turbine as two actuator discs, one upwind and the other down-wind. This suggestion, combined with a multiple streamtube approach, the momentum equations in the freestream direction and blade element theory enables the system of equations to be solved. A continuity argument connects the flow between the two discs. The theory does not rely on analytic formulations for aerofoil force coefficients and can therefore use data obtained from experiment, tabulated for a range of Reynolds numbers, thereby including the effects of stall and drag. Comparison with the power coefficients obtained from experiments, using a two-bladed wind tunnel turbine at a Reynolds number of 28, 000 (based on free wind speed and blade chord) shows that the theory is accurate enough to detect the effect of dynamic stall. It is also shown that the continuity argument is essential for improved power output predictions, over earlier single actuator disc theories. The new theory also indicates large differences between air speeds on the upwind and <b>downwind</b> <b>sides</b> of the turbine. These were also confirmed by experiment. Comparison of blade force predictions with those obtained using a computationally expensive time-marching discrete vortex theory shows that good estimates are obtained over the normal turbine operating range.

40|$|International audienceIn desert, complex {{patterns}} of dunes form. Under unidirectional wind, transverse rectilinear dunes or crescent shaped dunes called barchan dunes can appear, {{depending on the}} amount of sediment available. Most rectilinear transverse sand dunes are observed to fragment, for example at White Sands (New Mexico, United States of America) or Walvis Bay (Namibia). We develop a reduced complexity model to investigate the morphodynamics of sand dunes migrating over a non-erodible bed under unidirectional wind. The model is simply based on two physical ingredients, namely, the sand capture process at the slip face and the cross-wind sand transport. The efficiency of the sand capture process is taken to be dependent of the dune height and lateral diffusion is considered on both the windward and lee sides of the dune. In addition, the dune cross section is assumed to be scale invariant and is approximated by a triangular shape. In this framework, the dune dynamics is reduced to the motion of a string representing the dune crest line and is expressed as a set of two coupled nonlinear differential equations. This simple model reveals its ability to reproduce basic features of barchan and transverse dunes. Analytical predictions are drawn concerning dune equilibrium shape, stability and long-term dynamics. We derive, in particular, analytical solutions for barchan dunes, yielding explicit relationships between their shape and the lateral sand diffusion; and analytical predictions for the migration speed and equilibrium sand flux. A stability analysis of a rectilinear transverse dune allows us to predict analytically the wavelength emerging from fluctuations of the dune crest. We also determine the characteristic time needed for the rectilinear dune to fragment into a multitude of barchan dunes. These outcomes show that extremely simple ingredients can generate complex patterns for migrating dunes. From several dune field data, we are able to determine values of the model parameters and in particular the intensity of the lateral sand diffusion on upwind and <b>downwind</b> <b>sides</b> of the dune, bringing a new light on sediment transport processes...|$|R

High frequencies of elevated ozone are found in various remote, rural, and metropolitan districts of Hong Kong. Meteorological conditions related to synoptic-scale flow pattern, mesoscale weather phenomenon, and local micrometeorology have strong effects on the pollutant transport to South China and the occurrence of ozone episodes in Hong Kong. The transport processes and the source regions of ozone are analyzed with the combined use of surface pressure patterns, streamline charts and prevalent winds, and with representative episodes. The synoptic meteorological conditions can be classified into nine patterns. The patterns associated with winter monsoon and traveling cyclones {{are found to be}} most conducive to the occurrence of ozone episodes. Long-range transport of ozone with enhanced CO level from the aged continental air accompanying northeast monsoon contributes to substantial cases of episodes, which are especially noticeable in the upwind remote areas. These episodes feature consistently high ozone at night in the remote station and early morning peaks in the metropolitan stations. The possible source regions of this ozone may include Asian continent, the coastal areas of Mainland China, southern Japan, and Taiwan.

40|$|Abstract—Wind {{turbine blades}} are {{structurally}} composed {{of different types}} of materials. Some of which include; wood and/or steel used for constructing the main-spar and glass reinforced plastic (GRP) for building the <b>downwind</b> and upwind <b>sides</b> of the blade. During manufacture and over the operation lifetime of wind turbine blades, they are subject to defects and degradation which can result to deformation/fault occurrence (such as cracks) and subsequent failure. The wide-spread of materials used in their construction makes it difficult for predictions on lifetime health to be made, thus the importance of condition monitoring. Condition monitoring of wind turbines is an effective method for improving the maintenance and subsequent operation of wind turbine systems. In this paper, non-destructive evaluations were conducted using vibration/modal analysis, low-cost MEMS (Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems) accelerometers and signal processing techniques to detect defects and variations in the health of small wind turbine blades. A healthy (new) and an unhealthy (old) Rutland 913 Windcharger blade were tested in a small scale experiment and comparisons were made. Results showed that the presence of a crack and the overall deterioration in the structural health of the old blade increased its modal frequency from that of the new blade and an edge crack decreased the local stiffness of the wind turbine blade. Experiments were conducted on a 4. 5 m blade to show how the results extend to larger blades. In conclusion, these low-cost accelerometers have the ability to detect high and low blade resonance frequencies and have the potential to be integrated easily either retrofitted externally or embedded in blades at manufacture for condition monitoring at marginal cost.
