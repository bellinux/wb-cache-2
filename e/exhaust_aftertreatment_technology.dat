40|$|Due to {{the lower}} EURO 4 {{emission}} limits, exhaust aftertreatment systems for heavy- and light-duty vehicles will be necessary which are more efficient than the today 3 -way- or oxidation-type catalysts. Practicable exhaust aftertreatment systems are, for example, particle traps, SCR or NOx- adsorber catalysts, and combinations of these systems. Most of these exhaust control devices require fuels with sulphur contents below 10 ppm. Then the sulphate emissions from lubricants containing about 0. 5 % sulphur {{is in the same}} order of magnitude as sulphate emissions from low sulfur fuels. Measured data on the influence of sulphur from lubricating oils on future exhaust treatment systems are very limited. Conclusions have mostly been drawn from experimental results with low sulphur fuels. It cannot be ruled out, especially for NOx- adsorbers, that sulphur will adversely affect performance, thus making a reduction of sulphur levels in engine oils necessary. As far as diesel exhaust is concerned lubricants contribute approximately 20 - 26 % to total particulate matter and more than 50 % to the soluble organic fraction (SOF). Ash deposits derived from additives that contain zinc, calcium, sulphur, or phosphorous are likely to block the newly developed particle filter systems. Also for diesel technologies incorporating precious-metal catalysts (e. g. DOC, CDPF, CR-DPF, Urea- SCR) low sulphur levels are advantageous because the mass of sulphate particulate matter formed from fuel or lubricant sulphur is reduced. Conventional three-way catalysts are less sensitive, the light-off temperature being mainly affected. In summary, all available studies suggest that the lower the level of sulphur the lower emissions are. Furthermore phosphorous (associated with the antiwear additive ZDTP) was shown to limit catalyst life and, together with thermal degradation, is responsible for reduced catalyst efficiency over time. Although there is still a lack of quantitative technical information, it can be assumed that engine oil will make a significant contribution to EURO 4 limits of tail-pipe emissions, resulting mainly from secondary poisoning effects on catalyst and filter systems. Further research is thus necessary to make existing engine oil formulations and vehicle lubricant consumption compatible with the requirements of new <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>technology.</b> (orig.)

40|$|To {{meet the}} demand for heavy- and {{light-duty}} diesel vehicles on expansive markets while complying with current and future emission standards, {{it is necessary to}} reinsure the long-livety of the applied <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>technology.</b> Loss of catalytic performance may be associated with environmental as well as economical consequences. To aid the development of improved exhaust control components, such as the diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC), and optimise the use of raw materials, methods for accelerating the deactivation process are used. Catalysts can be aged in an engine-bench setup to simulate conditions in the field and thereby shorten the test procedure. The most resource efficient approach relies on using synthetic aging procedures to achieve such effect, which is the main focus of this thesis. 	To confirm a relevant effect of thermal and chemical deactivation, model DOCs were prepared and exposed to a variety of conditions, including atmospheres containing SO 2 and H 2 O, prior to characterisation of activity for CO oxidation, Pt dispersion, BET surface area, C 3 H 6 adsorption capacity (TPD) and surface composition (XPS). Hydrothermal treatment affected the HC trap function, critical for cold-start performance, and catalytic activity. Sulfur, adsorbed during low-temperature exposure, was the main cause for loss of Pt dispersion and activity for CO oxidation despite removal of the major part of SO 2 in succeeding heat treatment. A fresh commercial DOC (0 km) was subjected to different aging procedures and compared to samples dismantled from vehicles with different driving distance and sulfur content in the fuel. The deactivation of the vehicle-aged catalysts was confirmed by measuring emission levels in dynamometer tests and in lab reactor measurements. A similar degree of deactivation was observed, from flow reactor experiments and TEM analysis of Pt sintering, by using a 15 - 30 h rapid aging procedure combining poisoning at low temperature with (hydro) thermal treatment. The different sources of catalyst poisoning were studied with XPS. While S and Zn could be removed in reducing atmosphere at 700 ºC, results confirmed that P and Ca cause irreversible chemical deactivation of the vehicle-aged catalysts. The strong interaction of the sulfates with the washcoat, shown for both aging methods, highlights the importance of using low-sulfur diesel fuel. The described methods for rapid aging can be used for simulating catalyst poisoning in general terms, where accumulation of poisons during long-term exposure to diesel exhaust of low temperature is of concern. Hydrothermal treatment mimic periods of higher engine load and exotherms from regeneration processes...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to collect and {{evaluate}} environmentally relevant data on exhaust emissions from the combustion products of engine oils and their effects on the function of (next-generation) emission control systems. Due to the lower EURO 4 emission limits, exhaust aftertreatment systems for heavy- and light-duty vehicles will be necessary which are more efficient than the 3 -way- or oxidation-type catalysts common today. Practicable exhaust aftertreatment systems are, for example, particle traps, improved catalysts (including selective catalytic reduction, or fuel-borne catalysts), NO×-adsorbers, and combinations of these systems. Most of these exhaust control devices require fuels with sulphur contents below 10 ppm. In Germany, gasoline that meets this specification has recently been introduced on a small scale. However, the emissions generated by these low sulphur levels are almost in the same order of magnitude as the emissions of sulphur compounds derived from the consumption of lubricants that contain about 0. 5 % sulphur. As measurement data in this area is very limited, conclusions have mostly been drawn from experimental results with low sulphur fuels. It cannot be ruled out, expecially for NO×-adsorbers, that sulphur will adversely affect performance all the way down to concentrations of O ppm, thus making a reduction of sulphur levels in engine oils sem necessary. Diesel technologies incorporating precious-metal catalysts (e. g. DOC, CDPF, CR-DPF, UreaSCR) perform better with sulphur levels below 10 ppm because this reduces the mass of sulphate particulate matter formed from fuel or lubricant sulphur. Conventional three-way catalysts are less sensitive, which mainly affects the light-off temperature. In summary, all available studies suggest that the lower the level of sulphur the lower emissions are after passing over the catalyst. Enough evidence is now available to show that phosphorous (associated with the antiwear additive ZDTP) limits catalyst life and, together with thermal degradation, is responsible for reduced catalyst efficiency over time. Lubricants contribute approximately 20 - 26 % to total particulate matter from diesel exhaust (passenger cars) and often more than 50 % to the soluble organic fraction (SOF). Ash deposits derived from additives that contain zinc, calcium, magnesium, or phosphorous are likely to block the newly developed particle filter systems and cannot be removed through thermal regeneration processes. Although there is still a critical lack of available technical information, it can be assumed that engine oil will make a significant contribution to EURO 4 limits of tail-pipe emissions, resulting mainly from secondary poisoning effects on catalyst and filter systems.

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>technologies,</b> {{and the costs}} thereof, {{required}} to achieve future emissions legislation. Firstly, a brief summary {{of the types of}} systems is addressed with a cost of implementation implicitly attached to each system of choice. The three major routes considered to meet the various legislated limits are: a diesel particulate filter coupled with EGR (exhaust gas recirculation), a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system based on urea, and a combination of both a filter and SCR. The systems are reviewed with an emphasis on emissions reduction potential as well as possible diesel fuel savings where applicable. Secondly, the cost implications of using a secondary, water-based fuel (urea) on board diesel vehicles as a basis for NOx reduction via a simple discounted cash flow methodology are explored. By utilising the methodology described, various parameters such as fuel costs (both diesel and urea), annual mileage, fuel economy, and system cost can be varied and examined in detail. The ‘system’ costs are calculated throughout the vehicle life, within a practical framework, in order to assess the feasibility of implementing these advanced aftertreatment systems in the future. Other issues that are briefly considered include quantities of urea predicted {{to meet the needs of}} the systems, urea fuel storage and delivery aspects, and potential increase in urea production...|$|R
40|$|The {{automotive}} industry is currently struggling {{because of the}} increasingly stricter emissions standards that will take effect in the near future. Diesel engine emissions are of particular interest because they are still less understood than gasoline powered internal combustion engines. On the solid side of the exhaust emissions picture, particulates, or Soot and Ash, play the most important part. It {{has been found that}} ash is mostly a product of the fuel and oil composition. An oil consumption measuring system is then necessary if the relationship between oil consumption and ash increase in the sump oil and exhaust system is to be properly determined. This Thesis project consisted of experimentally measuring the variation of oil sump composition of a single-cylinder diesel generator set during a continuous running, steady state test. This was measured using ICP-AES (ICP-OES) elemental analysis technique, and the Total Base Number for the oil was also determined. An effective and reduced cost oil consumption and replenishing system was developed with this purpose. (cont.) The oil composition analysis demonstrated that the concentration of inorganic/metallic compounds (Ca, P, Zn, Mg) that contribute to ash increased throughout the test, jointly with oil consumption. The oil consumption measuring system developed was also found to be fairly accurate; with an approximate 2. 2 % error, probably due to oil hold-up. These results were then used to determine the possible effects of oil composition and oil consumption on Ash emissions and <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>technologies.</b> by Elliott Ortiz-Soto.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present the results of diesel <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> testing and analysis done under the FreedomCAR program. Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) adsorber technology was selected based on a previous investigation of various NOx <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>technologies</b> including non-thermal plasma, NOx adsorber and active lean NOx. Particulate Matter (PM) emissions were addressed by developing a catalyzed particulate filter. After various iterations of the catalyst formulation, the aftertreatment components were integrated and optimized for a light duty vehicle application. This compact <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> system is dual leg and consists of a sulfur trap, NOx adsorbers, and catalyzed particulate filters (CPF). During regeneration, supplementary ARCO ECD low-sulfur diesel fuel is injected upstream of the adsorber and CPF in the exhaust. Steady state and transient emission test results with and without the <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> system (EAS) are presented. Results of soot filter regeneration by injecting low-sulfur diesel fuel and slip of unregulated emissions, such as NH 3, are discussed. Effects of adsorber size and bypass strategy on NOx conversion efficiency and fuel economy penalty are also presented in this paper. The results indicate that if the supplementary fuel injection is optimized, NH 3 slip is negligible. During the FTP cycle, injection of low sulfur diesel fuel can create temperature exotherms high enough to regenerate a loaded CPF. With the optimized NOx adsorber regeneration strategies the fuel injection penalty can be reduced by 40 to 50 %. Results for various other issues like low temperature light off, reductant optimization, exhaust sulfur management, system integration and design trade-off, are also presented and discussed in this paper.

40|$|Improvements in {{internal}} combustion engine and <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>technologies</b> are needed to meet future environmental quality goals. Systems using recently developed compact plasmatron fuel converters in conjunction with state-of-the-art engines and aftertreatment catalysts could provide new opportunities for obtaining substantial emissions reductions. Plasmatron fuel converters provide a rapid response, compact means to transform {{a wide range of}} hydrocarbon fuels (including gasoline, natural gas and diesel fuel) into hydrogen rich gas. Hydrogen rich gas can be used as an additive to provide NOx reductions of more than 80 % in spark ignition gasoline engine vehicles by enabling very lean operation or heavy exhaust engine recirculation. It may also be employed for cold start hydrocarbon reduction. If certain requirements are met, it may also be possible to achieve higher spark ignition engine efficiencies (e. g., up to 95 % of those of diesel engines). These requirements include the attainment of ultra lean, high compression ratio, open throttle operation using only a modest amount of hydrogen addition. For diesel engines, use of compact plasmatron reformers to produce hydrogen-rich gas for the regeneration of NOx absorber/adsorbers and particulate traps for diesel engine <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> could provide significant advantages.

40|$|There is an {{increased}} demand for diesel engines running on non-fossil fuels such as dimethyl ether (DME), biodiesel and synthetic diesel. DME is a promising alternative fuel with potential for high energy efficiency and low CO 2 emissions. However, during all high temperature combustion NOx is formed, which may require <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment.</b> Two <b>technologies</b> for NOx reduction under lean conditions utilizing the fuel as reducing agent are the lean NOx catalyst (LNC) and the lean NOx adsorber (LNA). Lean NOx reduction with alternative fuels was investigated in a flow reactor and showed that DME was an efficient reducing agent for NOx over a BaO-based LNA, but not over a Cu-ZSM- 5 -based LNC. Also methanol did not reduce NOx over Cu-ZSM- 5, whereas higher ethers and alcohols did. Despite being more oxidised than DME, ethylene glycol reduced NOx. It was concluded that a C–C bond is required in hydrocarbon-based reducing agents for lean NOx reduction over Cu-ZSM- 5. A comparison of biodiesel, synthetic diesel, conventional diesel and octane as reducing agents, showed that Cu-ZSM- 5 reduced NOx at a lower temperature than Ag/Al 2 O 3, which was {{more sensitive to the}} reductant used. RME gave the lowest, and octane the highest, NOx conversion over both catalysts. The oxygenated hydrocarbon triethylene glycol dimethyl ether (triglyme) efficiently reduced NOx over Ag/Al 2 O 3, but not over Cu-ZSM- 5. Adding a low amount of triglyme to propene as reducing agents drastically promoted the NOx conversion over Ag/Al 2 O 3 at low temperature. A series of In 2 O 3 -, Ga 2 O 3 - or B 2 O 3 -promoted γ-Al 2 O 3 catalysts were investigated for lean NOx reduction with DME. B 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 and Ga 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 catalysts gave a temperature window similar to Al 2 O 3, but with higher NOx conversion. In 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 showed the highest NOx conversion at low temperature, whereas pure In 2 O 3 was inactive for NOx reduction with DME. It was concluded that a close interaction between In 2 O 3 and Al 2 O 3 is essential for the promoting effect of In 2 O 3 at low temperature. In-situ DRIFT spectroscopy showed that the differences in activity of In 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3, pure Al 2 O 3 and pure In 2 O 3 correlated to differences in the amounts of surface species that are possible intermediates of the reaction...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundChanging {{the fuel}} supply from {{petroleum}} based ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) to biodiesel and its blends {{is considered by}} many to be a viable option for controlling exposures to particulate material (PM). This is critical in the mining industry where approximately 28, 000 underground miners are potentially exposed to relatively high concentrations of diesel particulate matter (DPM). This study was conducted to investigate the mutagenic potential of diesel engine emissions (DEE) from neat (B 100) and blended (B 50) soy-based fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) biodiesel in comparison with ULSD PM using different engine operating conditions and <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> configurations. MethodsThe DPM samples were collected for engine equipped with either a standard muffler or a combination of the muffler and diesel oxidation catalytic converter (DOC) that was operated at four different steady-state modes. Bacterial gene mutation activity of DPM was tested on the organic solvent extracts using the Ames Salmonella assay. ResultsThe results indicate that mutagenic activity of DPM was strongly affected by fuels, engine operating conditions, and <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> systems. The mutagenicity was increased with the fraction of biodiesel in the fuel. While the mutagenic activity was observed in B 50 and B 100 samples collected from both light-and heavy-load operating conditions, the ULSD samples were mutagenic only at light-load conditions. The presence of DOC in the exhaust system resulted in the decreased mutagenicity when engine was fueled with B 100 and B 50 and operated at light-load conditions. This was not the case when engine was fueled with ULSD. Heavy-load operating condition in the presence of DOC resulted in a decrease of mutagenicity only when engine was fueled with B 50, but not B 100 or ULSD. ConclusionsTherefore, the results indicate that DPM from neat or blended biodiesel has a higher mutagenic potency than that one of ULSD.

While societal impact and therefore emission limit values are to be reduced in big steps, continuous improvement is not enough but technological quantum leaps are necessary. The introduction and refinement of electronic control of all major engine systems has already been a quantum leap forward. Maximizing the benefits of these technologies to customers and society requires full use of parameter optimization and other enabling technologies. The next big step forward will be widespread use of <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> on all transportation related diesel engines. While <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>aftertreatment</b> has been successfully established on gasoline (Otto cycle) engines, the introduction of <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> especially for heavy-duty diesel engines will be much mo re demanding. Implementing <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>aftertreatment</b> into commercial vehicle applications is a challenging task but the emission requirements to be met starting in Europe, the USA and Japan in the 2005 - 2007 timeframe require this step. The engine industry will be able to implement the new technology if all stakeholders support the necessary decisions. One decision has already been taken: the reduction of sulfur in diesel fuel being comparable with the elimination of lead in gasoline as a prerequisite for the three-way catalyst. Now we have the chance to optimize ecology and economy of the Diesel engine simultaneously by taking the decision to provide an additional infrastructure for a NOx reduction agent needed for the introduction of the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) technology that is already implemented in the electric power generation industry. This requires some effort, but the resulting societal benefits, fuel economy and vehicle life cycle costs are significantly better when compared to other competitive technologies. After long discussions this decision for SCR has been made in Europe and is supported by all truck and engine manufacturers. The necessary logistic support will be in place when it will be needed commercially in 2005. For the US the decision has to be taken this year in order to have the infrastructure available in 2007.

The high energy efficiency is achieved by heat recuperation, on-board hydrogen production for use in both an auxiliary power unit and for NOx reduction and by finding new solutions for making the after-treatment system active at low exhaust temperatures. To reach low particulate emissions a mechanical filter using a sintered metal filter is developed. Low NOx emissions are achieved by an efficient NOx reduction catalyst. The system is based on four technological advances: Thermoelectric material s for heat recuperation, catalyti...|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{understanding}} of sintering in diesel and lean-burn engine <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> catalysts, we examined oxygen-induced sintering in a model catalyst consisting of Pt nanoparticles supported on a planar, amorphous Al 2 O 3 substrate. After ageing at increasing temperatures, transmission electron microscopy analysis reveals that highly monodisperse ensembles of nanoparticles transformed into ensembles with bimodal and subsequently Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner particle size distributions. Moreover, {{scanning transmission electron microscopy}} and atomic force microscopy analysis suggest that the Pt nanoparticles have size-dependent morphologies after sintering in oxidizing environment. The evolution of the particle sizes is described by a simple kinetic model for ripening and the size-dependent particle morphology is proposed as an explanation for the observed bimodal particle size distribution shapes...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this program was to develop generic <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>technologies</b> applicable for LDV and LDT engines ranging from 55 kW to 200 kW, to develop an optimized and integrated aftertreatment system for a LDT (Light Duty Truck) type vehicle, and to demonstrate the technology which will enable light duty diesel engines to meet Federal Tier II regulation with minimum impact on fuel economy. Specifically, the development targets for emissions reduction and fuel injection penalty are given below: (1) NOx conversion efficiency > 90 % (hot), > 84 % (combined); (2) PM conversion efficiency > 90 % (hot), > 84 % (combined); (3) Fuel penalty over FTP- 75 Less than 5 %; and (4) Fuel penalty at Cruise condition Less than 3 %. Development of cost-effective, highly efficient diesel <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> systems in combination with very low engine out emission combustion development are essential elements for realization of Federal Tier II emission standards for Light Duty Trucks and Vehicles. Evaluation of several <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>technologies</b> was completed {{as part of this}} program. A combination of Diesel Oxidation Catalyst, NOx Adsorbing Catalyst and Catalyzed Soot Filter was found to provide the levels of conversion efficiency required to achieve the emission targets. While early systems required relatively large catalyst volumes, external dosing, sulfur traps, full bypass configurations and high levels of Platinum metals; the final system is a compact, scalable, flow-through, fully-integrated and engine-managed aftertreatment system capable of commercial application for Light Duty Vehicles and Trucks. NOx adsorber/particulate filter technology is particularly attractive for Light Duty applications due to the lower exhaust flow and temperature requirements as compared to Heavy Duty engines. Despite these strong positive aspects, NOx Adsorbers are challenged by their regeneration requirements and susceptibility to sulfur poisoning and thermal degradation. Capability was developed to regenerate the NOx Adsorber for NOx and SOx as well as the Particulate Filter for soot. This system was fully integrated into a truck and evaluated over the chassis dynamometer for emissions capability and in real-world winter field testing. Durability of the system was evaluated over a variety of accelerated and real-time dynamometer tests. Excellent NOx and PM conversion efficiency was demonstrated, even following 3000 hrs of endurance testing. Unregulated emissions emitted by the system were evaluated as was the fuel penalty associated with the DeNOx and DeSOx regeneration processes. In the final evaluation, the system demonstrated 90 % NOx conversion and 99 % PM conversion at a 6 % fuel penalty over the FTP- 75 test cycle. While target fuel penalty levels were demonstrated using full-bypass configuration systems, the cost associated with those systems was prohibitively high and would preclude successful commercialization of the technology. Although the flow-through configuration fell 1 % short of the 5 % fuel penalty target, the cost of this configuration is such that commercial application is feasible. Cost drivers for the final system configuration were identified and demonstrate areas where future development areas could focus...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: One of the {{critical}} needs of a Three Way Catalyst (TWC) model {{is to be able}} to predict light-off. This is crucial for application studies and vehicle architectural studies because most of the emissions from a TWC occur before light-off (called cold-start emissions). Laboratory experiments give detailed insights to the reaction mechanism and analytical forms of the rate expressions as they are well-controlled and well-behaved as compared to vehicle tests. However, to predict emissions on a vehicle test, the laboratory-estimated kinetic parameters are not entirely capable because of the various uncertainties in the vehicle tests. In this work, six different vehicle data sets are used to calibrate and validate the TWC global kinetic model. Our emphasis in this work is restricted to predicting the light-off (cold-start emissions) in TWC. The kinetic model is calibrated using 4 vehicle data sets (which use the FTP drive cycle) using iSIGHT software package. The kinetic parameters of the various reactions occurring in the TWC are estimated to match the experimental data through exploratory and local optimization methods. A systematic approach (with increasing complexity) is used to estimate the kinetic parameters. The estimated parameters are then used to validate the model on two different vehicle data sets (one NEDC drive cycle and one FTP drive cycle) with different catalyst compositions and engine power (and hence different engine out exhaust compositions). The model with estimated kinetic parameters predicts the light-off reasonably well for the new data sets. The parameter estimation approach in this work is kept as generic as possible to <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> devices, and a set of guidelines for parameter estimation (specifically for use in <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> devices) is presented (in the Appendix) ...|$|R
40|$|Onboard {{generation}} of hydrogen-rich gas {{can be used}} in a number of applications to improve environmental quality and reduce petroleum consumption of internal combustion engine vehicles. Plasmatron fuel reformer technology is being developed at MIT as means of practical on-board production of hydrogen-rich gas from a variety of fuels. The device is based on the use of a special low current, low power volumetric discharge in very rich fuel/air mixtures. Although the process is slightly exothermic, system advantages overwhelm the slight inefficiency of the process. In this paper, recent progress on plasmatron fuel reformer and applications are described.

40|$|This study aims to {{show how}} both NOx and soot are {{affected}} by EGR dilution when constant, as well as variations in equivalence ratio is applied together with multiple injection strategies. Experiments were conducted in a single cylinder heavy duty research engine. The effects of both EGR and equivalence ratio on partly premixed combustion were investigated. Multiple injections strategies were combined with high EGR levels and lean mixtures. Multiple injections were used to control the combustion phasing {{and the level of}} the premixed combustion rate. The diesel combustion conditioning by means of premixed combustion rate, EGR level and oxidant equivalence ratio, leads to low engine emissions.
