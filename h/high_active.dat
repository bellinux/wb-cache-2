2500|$|After a {{successful}} attack, {{except in the}} case of a critical hit, the defender usually gets a chance to avoid the blow. [...] This is called an Active Defense, and takes the form of a Dodge (deliberate movement out of the perceived path of the attack), Parry (attempt to deflect or intercept the attack with a limb or weapon), or Block (effort to interpose a shield or similar object between the attack and the defender's body). [...] Unlike many RPG systems, an Active Defense is an unopposed check, meaning that in most cases, the success of an attack has no effect on the difficulty of the defense. [...] Dodge is based on the Basic Speed characteristic, while Parry and Block are each based on individual combat skills, such as Fencing, Karate, or Staff for Parry, and Shield or Cloak for Block. A common criticism is that characters can achieve a relatively <b>high</b> <b>Active</b> Defense value, drawing out fights considerably. The only mechanic within the system to address this is the Feint action, which if successful will place the adversary in an unfavorable position, reducing their active defense against that character only, on the subsequent turn.|$|E

50|$|Sintering {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} method in {{production}} technics and used to produce density-controlled materials and components from metal or ceramic powders by applying thermal energy. Synthesis and sintering of nanocrystalline ceramic powders have attracted much attention due totheir promising properties.

50|$|This {{signalling}} strategy differs {{significantly from}} other balanced line transmission {{technologies such as}} RS-422/3, RS-485, etc. which employ differential line drivers/ receivers and use a signalling system based on the differential mode voltage of the balanced line crossing a notional 0 V. Multiple access on such systems normally relies on the media supporting three states (active <b>high,</b> <b>active</b> low and inactive tri-state) and is {{dealt with in the}} time domain. Multiple access on CAN bus is achieved by the electrical logic of the system supporting just two states that are conceptually analogous to a ‘wired AND’ network.|$|E
