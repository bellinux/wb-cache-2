5|$|In 2017, the Indian {{economy was}} the world's sixth largest by nominal GDP and third largest by {{purchasing}} power parity. Following market-based economic reforms in 1991, India {{became one of}} the fastest-growing major economies and is considered a newly <b>industrialised</b> <b>country.</b> However, it continues to face the challenges of poverty, corruption, malnutrition, and inadequate public healthcare. A nuclear weapons state and regional power, it has the third largest standing army in the world and ranks fifth in military expenditure among nations. India is a federal republic governed under a parliamentary system and consists of 29 states and 7 union territories. It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society and is also home to a diversity of wildlife in a variety of protected habitats.|$|E
5|$|The {{usage of}} the metric system varies around the world. According to the US Central Intelligence Agency's Factbook (2007), the International System of Units has been adopted as the {{official}} system of weights and measures by all {{nations in the world}} except for Myanmar (Burma), Liberia and the United States, while the NIST has identified the United States as the only <b>industrialised</b> <b>country</b> where the metric system is not the predominant system of units. However, reports published since 2007 hold this is no longer true of Myanmar or Liberia. An Agence France-Presse report from 2010 stated that Sierra Leone had passed a law to replace the imperial system with the metric system thereby aligning its system of measurement with that used by its Mano River Union (MRU) neighbours Guinea and Liberia. Reports from Myanmar suggest that the country is also planning to adopt the metric system.|$|E

30|$|Viotti (2001) in {{examining}} the disparities between industrialised and late industrialising nations through a comparative analysis of Brazil and South Korea highlights a potential shortcoming of the NSI approach. He suggests {{that the process of}} innovation-led technical change is the privilege of <b>industrialised</b> <b>countries,</b> and that the process of technological change witnessed in <b>industrialising</b> <b>countries</b> is through the absorption and improvement of innovations produced in <b>industrialised</b> <b>countries.</b> Viotti (2001) thus proposes National Learning Systems (NLS) where absorption of technologies and incremental innovation are the focus of late <b>industrialising</b> <b>countries.</b> Here, NLS should be centred in the “activities, institutions, and relationships, associated to learning rather than innovation” (Viotti 2001, p. 7).|$|R

25|$|The United Kingdom is a {{developed}} country {{and has the}} world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and ninth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. The UK is considered to have a high-income economy and is categorised as very high in the Human Development Index, ranking 16th in the world. It was the world's first <b>industrialised</b> <b>country</b> and the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The UK remains a great power with considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific and political influence internationally. It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and is seventh in military expenditure in the world. The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946. It has been a leading member state of the EU and its predecessor, the European Economic Community (EEC), since 1973. However, on 23 June 2016, a national referendum on the UK's membership of the EU resulted in a decision to leave, and its exit from the EU is currently being negotiated.

500|$|The {{metric system}} has been {{official}}ly sanctioned {{for use in the}} United States since 1866, but the U.S. remains the only <b>industrialised</b> <b>country</b> that has not fully adopted the metric system as its official system of measurement, although in 1988 the United States Congress passed the Omnibus Foreign Trade and Competitiveness Act, which designates [...] "the metric system of measurement as the preferred system of weights and measures for U.S. trade and commerce". Among many other things, the act requires federal agencies to use metric measurements in nearly all of its activities, although there are still some exceptions allowing traditional linear units to be used in documents intended for consumers. Many sources also cite the countries of Liberia and Myanmar (Burma) [...] as the only other countries not to have done so. Although the United Kingdom also uses the metric system for most administrative and trade purposes, imperial units are widely used by the public and are permitted or obligatory for some purposes, such as road signs.|$|E

This high level of social cohesion is attributed to the small size and homogeneity of the population, as well as to a long history of harsh survival in an isolated environment, which reinforced the importance of unity and cooperation.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – To provide {{philosophical}} {{discussions of}} various works, thinking of globalisations and new thoughts {{on how the}} developing countries might take benefit of globalisation. Design/methodology/approach – A wide range of published works, which contain the recent thoughts and debates of the globalisation to developing nations are reviewed, analysed and then critiqued. The authors take some case study examples and evidence from developing worlds, most notably in Indonesia. Findings – At present, the impact of globalisation will benefit mostly to <b>industrialised</b> <b>countries</b> or MNC's operating in developing countries. Globalisation will bring prosperity to developing world only if <b>industrialised</b> <b>countries</b> and MNC's are willing to adopt a code of conduct, which permits their profit motives to be harmonised with the self-reliant interest of developing nations. The global rule must be changed in favour of developing countries. Research limitations/implications – Globalisation is a very wide issue. This paper only highlights issues related to trade, labour, intellectual property and environment. Not many developing and <b>industrialised</b> <b>countries</b> are taken as case example. Thus, {{there are still a}} lot of further research needed to prove its usefulness. Practical implications – Provide a useful source to the global players like <b>industrialised</b> <b>countries,</b> MNC's. It highlights how <b>industrialised</b> <b>countries</b> might contribute to assist developing countries to catch up in line with globalisation. Also useful to MNC's CEO wants to increase their corporate social responsibility. Originality/value – Provide new taught and suggestion to developing <b>countries,</b> MNC's and <b>industrialised</b> <b>countries.</b> Some evidence, arguments and recommendations have not been discussed in the globalisation debate.

In time, considerable numbers of able young men came down, eventually dominating {{the administration of the}} Transvaal. [...] Kruger welcomed their arrival, not only were they of the same blood, but the Netherlands had no political ambition in South Africa – unlike Britain and her uitlanders.|$|E

In contrast to the existing literature on FDI, this paper shows that falling transport costs first lead to increased FDI activities and only later to decreased FDI. Additionally, FDI is more likely to occur in industries with differentiated products, higher scale economies on company relative to plant level, smaller inputs of intermediate goods and more differentiated intermediate goods. ...|$|R

50|$|Another {{corollary}} of the H-O theorem is Samuelson's {{factor price}} equalisation theorem {{which states that}} as trade between countries tends to equalise their product prices, it tends also to equalise the prices paid to their factors of production.

Large numbers of learned papers have been produced in attempts to elaborate on the H-O and Stolper-Samuelson theorems, and while many of them are considered to provide valuable insights, they have seldom proved to be directly applicable to the task of explaining trade patterns.|$|E
