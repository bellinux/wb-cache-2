5|$|I am vexed and {{surprised}} at your not thinking {{the situation of}} Maria sufficiently important, and can only account for this want of – shall I say it? delicacy of feeling, by recollecting {{that you are a}} man – For my part I cannot suppose any situation more distressing than for a woman of sensibility with an improving mind to be bound, to such a man as I have described, for life – obliged to renounce all the humanizing affections, and to avoid cultivating <b>her</b> <b>taste</b> lest her perception of grace, and refinement of sentiment should sharpen to agony the pangs of disappointment.|$|E
25|$|No {{woman in}} recent time has {{combined}} her qualities – <b>her</b> <b>taste</b> for arduous and dangerous adventure with her scientific interest and knowledge, her competence in archaeology and art, her distinguished literary gift, her sympathy {{for all sorts}} and condition of men, her political insight and appreciation of human values, her masculine vigour, hard common sense and practical efficiency– all tempered by feminine charm and a most romantic spirit.|$|E
25|$|Most admirable {{of all her}} qualities, however, were <b>her</b> <b>taste,</b> {{elegance and}} deeply musical use of {{ornamentation}} {{in all its forms}} and complications, the weighting and length of every appoggiatura, the smooth incorporation of the turn in melodic lines, the accuracy and pacing of her trills, the seemingly inevitable timing of her portamentos, varying their curve with enchanting grace and meaning. There were innumerable exquisite felicities—minuscule portamentos from one note to its nearest neighbor, or over widespread intervals—and changes of color that were pure magic. In these aspects of bel canto she was supreme mistress of that art.|$|E

They encounter again at a wedding in her hometown of Constance and marry. However their married life becomes an exercise for her husband to express his sadism and for Martha to endure her masochism.

25|$|The grand duchess {{played a}} leading role in the {{decoration}} of her home, displaying <b>her</b> <b>taste</b> and sense of elegance. Because Maria Nikolaievna was afflicted with circulatory leg problems, the Mariinsky Palace was designed with a staircase without steps installed in the right wing connecting all three floors away from the main rooms. The palace was filled with works of arts and family relics, some of them inherited from Empress Josephine. Maria organized lavish parties, theatrical performances and concerts. Maria Nikolaevna also had a country estate, Sergievka, bought from the Naryshkin family and given to her as a wedding gift. Located west of Peterhof in a little bay opposite Kronstadt, the villa Sergievka became a favorite family retreat. The grand duchess and her husband spent their honeymoon there and between 1839 and 1842 they commissioned Stackensneider to rebuild it. It was transformed from an old manor house into a summer palace in the style of a Roman patrician villa. In the summer they usually lived in Gatchina and Tsarskoye Selo.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} nineteen, Colby went to Madison, Wisconsin to {{live with}} her grandparents, Stephen Chilton and Clara Medhurst Willingham Chilton. Here she entered the University of Wisconsin–Madison, then in its infancy, which was {{struggling}} with co-education. She exerted a marked influence in securing the admission of women to the university and the adoption of the principles of co-education in Wisconsin. She was graduated in 1869 as the valedictorian and Phi Beta Kappa in the first class of women graduated from the school. At once, she became a teacher of history and Latin in the institution, while pursuing graduate studies. She married Leonard Wright Colby, a graduate of the same university, in June 1871, and moved to Beatrice the following year, where {{he was elected to the}} Nebraska State Senate. Amidst the hardships of pioneer life in a new place, the young wife found her family cares all-absorbing, but <b>her</b> <b>taste</b> for study, her love of literature and her natural desire to improve the conditions about her, led her to establish Beatrice's free public library in 1873.|$|E

[...] Guetta told Billboard that [...] "the track with Kelly has made him experiment with a more American urban influence. Musically, it's pure pop {{with a lot of}} detail."

500|$|In 1985, Madonna {{commented that}} the first song to ever make a strong {{impression}} on her was [...] "These Boots Are Made for Walkin'" [...] by Nancy Sinatra; she said it summed up her own [...] "take-charge attitude". As a young woman, she attempted to broaden <b>her</b> <b>taste</b> in literature, art, and music, and during this time became interested in classical music. She noted that her favorite style was baroque, and loved Mozart and Chopin because she liked their [...] "feminine quality". Madonna's major influences include Debbie Harry, Chrissie Hynde, Karen Carpenter, The Supremes and Led Zeppelin, as well as dancers Martha Graham and Rudolf Nureyev. She also {{grew up listening to}} David Bowie, whose show was the first rock concert she ever attended.|$|E

500|$|The new china, White House renovations, {{expensive}} clothing, and her {{attendance at}} the wedding of Charles and Diana, Prince and Princess of Wales, gave her an aura of being [...] "out of touch" [...] with the American people during the recession. This built upon the reputation she had coming to Washington, wherein many people concluded that Reagan was a vain and shallow woman, and <b>her</b> <b>taste</b> for splendor inspired the derogatory nickname [...] "Queen Nancy". While Jacqueline Kennedy had also faced some press criticism for her spending habits, Reagan's treatment was much more consistent and negative. In an attempt to deflect the criticism, she self-deprecatingly donned a baglady costume at the 1982 Gridiron Dinner and sang [...] "Second-Hand Clothes", mimicking the song [...] "Second-Hand Rose". The skit helped to restore her reputation.|$|E
500|$|Both Edward's {{sisters were}} {{attentive}} to their brother and often visited him – on one occasion, Elizabeth {{gave him a}} shirt [...] "of her own working". Edward [...] "took special content" [...] in Mary's company, though he disapproved of <b>her</b> <b>taste</b> for foreign dances; [...] "I love you most", he wrote to her in 1546. In 1543, Henry invited his children to spend Christmas with him, signalling his reconciliation with his daughters, whom he had previously illegitimised and disinherited. The following spring, he restored them to {{their place in the}} succession with a Third Succession Act, which also provided for a regency council during Edward's minority. This unaccustomed family harmony may have owed much to the influence of Henry's new wife, Catherine Parr, of whom Edward soon became fond. He called her his [...] "most dear mother" [...] and in September 1546 wrote to her: [...] "I received so many benefits from you that my mind can hardly grasp them." ...|$|E

After the Sugarcubes went on hiatus, she moved to London, England, where she and Birkett worked {{on the details of}} what would become Debut. Björk has admitted that The Sugarcube's music was not <b>her</b> <b>taste,</b> and that her contact with London's underground club culture of the late 1980s/early 1990s helped her find her own musical identity. She said: [...] "...as a music nerd, I just had to follow my heart, and my heart was those beats that were happening in England. And maybe what I'm understanding more and more as I get older, is that music like Kate Bush has really influenced me. Brian Eno. Acid. Electronic beats. Labels like Warp." ...|$|E

500|$|... {{is one of}} the few Australian artists {{here who}} {{combines}} a firm technique with a sensitive and rich emotion. In some of the lighter landscapes in this exhibition, Miss Bellette seems to have been trying to solve some of the particular difficulties of painting Australian landscapes. The clear, strong light tends to flatten the form and bleach the colour; a problem that doesn't lend itself to the dramatic tensions and dark moods that are characteristic of her work. It requires a colder and more dispassionate approach. But when she finds landscapes to <b>her</b> <b>taste,</b> such as the rugged hills and beetling clouds in No. 8, the earth decaying with erosion in No. 19, or the prickly desolation of [...] "Rough Country", No. 14, she handles them with great skill and effectiveness. Her figure drawings are decisively drawn and firmly modelled. The girls have a pensive dignity as though they are pondering the burdens and joylessness of a future to be spent as caryatids. The still lives and the interior are admirable exercises in formal organisation, the colours being sombre yet rich.|$|E

On Digital Spy's 2012 end of year reader poll, Cooper {{was nominated}} for [...] "Best Female Soap Actor" [...] and came third with 13.7% of the vote. Virgin Media criticised the character's dress sense, stating that even though none of the family have style, that Jacqui has the most 'criminal wardrobe' out of them due to <b>her</b> <b>taste</b> for thigh high boots, skin tight dresses and huge gold earrings. Co-star Kieron Richardson branded Cooper the unsung hero of the cast claiming she deserves more recognition for her work and stated his favourite character is Jacqui. Soap opera reporting website Holy Soap describe Jacqui's most memorable moment as: [...] "Dealing with Tina's decision not to give up baby Max, only for her to be killed by long-lost brother Niall." ...|$|E
500|$|George N. Shorey's {{review of}} the initial seven reel Broadway release {{declared}} it another masterpiece of Mack's writing and notes that the film {{would be the best}} example to go before the courts to argue for [...] "free speech" [...] in films. Shorey notes that the propaganda film [...] "is bold, clear, tremendous in the force of its convincing showing that to drive the scarlet woman from a restricted district into the hotels and apartment houses of a city is a worse crime than it seeks to cure." [...] The only complaint was found that it [...] "does not sufficiently misrepresent the ease and luxury of the underworld. It shows a scarlet woman who finds the [...] "easiest way" [...] truly easy. She does not die, nor even suffer. The intended moral of the picture, that once abandoned to that life a woman finds it to <b>her</b> <b>taste</b> to remain in it and cannot be [...] "reformed," [...] necessarily does include the above corollary to that proposition." [...] The San Francisco Chronicle wrote that the film [...] "deals with a question that has perplexed the sages from the beginning of time and it traverses life's scroll, writing with thought and deed certain actions of everyday application. There are tense dramatic scenes, and above all there is the question that must be faced, [...] "Who's Your Neighbor?"" ...|$|E

5000|$|Augusta {{never fully}} adapted {{to life in}} Brunswick due to her British patriotism and {{disregard}} of all things [...] "east of the Rhine". This attitude did not change with time, and twenty five years after her marriage, she was described as: [...] "wholly English in <b>her</b> <b>tastes,</b> <b>her</b> principles and her manners, {{to the point that}} her almost cynical independence makes, with the etiquette of the German courts, the most singular contrast I know".Augusta was not well liked at Brunswick, where her popularity was damaged by the fact that her eldest sons were born with handicaps.|$|R
500|$|The oeuvre {{comprises}} instrumental, vocal, orchestral and choral music. Early in her compositional career Imogen {{was primarily}} influenced, as Gustav Holst's daughter, {{by what the}} analyst Christopher Tinker terms [...] "her natural and inescapable relationship with the English musical establishment", and by her close personal relationship with her father. Some of her first compositions reflect the pastoralism of Ralph Vaughan Williams, who taught her at the RCM. In her teaching and EFDSS years during the 1930s she became known for her folksong arrangements but composed little music herself. The personal style {{that emerged in the}} 1940s incorporated her affinity with folksong and dance, her intense interest in English music of the 16th and 17th centuries, and <b>her</b> <b>taste</b> for innovation. In her 1930 suite for solo viola, she had begun experimenting with scale patterns; by the 1940s she was incorporating her own six- and eight-note scales into her chamber music and occasionally into choral works such as the Five Songs (1944). This experimentation reappears in later works; in Hallo My Fancy (1972) a new scale is introduced for each verse, while the choir provides free harmonisation to a solo voice. In Homage to William Morris (1984), among her final works, Tinker notes her use of dissonance [...] "to add strength to the musical articulation of the text". By contrast, the String Quintet of 1982, the work which Imogen herself thought made her [...] "a real composer", is characterised by the warmth of its harmonies.|$|E

2500|$|The bandleader and/or {{conductor}} (or for {{a recording}} session, a record producer) can overrule these rules by issuing {{instructions to the}} chord-playing musicians. For example, a bandleader can instruct the chord-playing musicians to play all chords with extensions and or alterations as simple seventh chords. Thus C 13(#11) would be played as C7 (the notes C, E, G, Bb). The bandleader or conductor may do this for reasons of <b>her</b> <b>taste,</b> artistic approach, style, or preferences or to suit the wishes of a certain audience. Alternatively, a bandleader or conductor may instruct chord-playing musicians to add extra colouration using extensions and altered dominants. Thus a jazz guitarist may play the chord C7 as C 13 (#9/#11).|$|E
