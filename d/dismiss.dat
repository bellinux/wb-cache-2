5|$|With {{the crisis}} unresolved, Kerr decided to <b>dismiss</b> Whitlam as prime minister. Fearing that Whitlam {{would go to}} the Queen and {{potentially}} have him removed, the Governor-General gave Whitlam no prior hint. He conferred (against Whitlam's advice) with High Court Chief Justice Sir Garfield Barwick, who agreed that he had the power to <b>dismiss</b> Whitlam.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} of the finals, he was Man of the Match for the third {{consecutive}} game, top–scoring for England with 70 and taking two wickets, as well another difficult catch off the bowling of Sajid Mahmood to once again <b>dismiss</b> Matthew Hayden.|$|E
5|$|The Seventh Circuit {{affirmed the}} {{district}} court's denial of Hemi's motion to <b>dismiss</b> {{for lack of}} personal jurisdiction, finding that Internet transactions of cigarettes sufficed to establish personal jurisdiction over Hemi in Illinois.|$|E
25|$|Mohinder {{had some}} unique dismissals. He {{is also the}} one and only Indian who has been <b>dismissed</b> on {{handling}} the ball. He was <b>dismissed</b> on 9 February 1986 also making him the first one to be <b>dismissed</b> for handling the ball in One-Day Internationals. He is also the only Indian to be <b>dismissed</b> for obstructing the field in One-Day Internationals. He has also been <b>dismissed</b> 'hit wicket'.|$|R
25|$|Watson-Smith's 310 career runs {{before being}} <b>dismissed</b> {{remained}} {{a world record}} until 2015, when the Victorian batsman Travis Dean made 347 runs before being <b>dismissed.</b> Dean was <b>dismissed</b> in his second first-class match.|$|R
5000|$|Napper made {{a single}} {{first-class}} appearance for Sussex against England at Trent Bridge at the Royal New Ground, Brighton in 1838. [...] Sussex were <b>dismissed</b> for 72 in their first-innings, with Napper scoring 8 runs {{before he was}} <b>dismissed</b> by William Hillyer and in response, England were <b>dismissed</b> for 67. In Sussex's second-innings, Napper contributed 7 runs to Sussex's total of 129, with James Cobbett <b>dismissing</b> him. England were <b>dismissed</b> for just 49 in their second-innings, with Sussex winning by 85 runs.|$|R
5|$|The passion {{she showed}} for Abigail, and the {{stubborn}} refusal to <b>dismiss</b> her, angered Sarah {{to the point}} that she implied that a lesbian affair was taking place between the two women. During the mourning period for Anne's husband, Sarah {{was the only one who}} refused to wear suitable mourning clothes. This gave the impression that she did not consider Anne's grief over his death to be genuine. Eventually, because of the mass support for peace in the War of the Spanish Succession, Anne decided she no longer needed the Duke of Marlborough and took the opportunity to <b>dismiss</b> him on trumped-up charges of embezzlement.|$|E
5|$|After McDonnell {{had made}} 103 out of 158, Murdoch and Scott {{completed}} the first double-century partnership in Test cricket. England, as the score mounted, used 11 bowlers: {{the first time}} in Test cricket that an entire team including the wicketkeeper was called upon to bowl. On this occasion, the wicketkeeper Lyttelton was the most successful bowler, taking 4/19. Grace, keeping wicket to Lyttelton, took a catch to <b>dismiss</b> Midwinter.|$|E
5|$|Alexander Aldea died {{in autumn}} 1436, {{enabling}} Vlad Dracul to seize Wallachia with Hungarian support. He did not <b>dismiss</b> his predecessor's {{officials with the}} exception of Albu, who thus became his enemy. Vlad did not confirm the treaty that Alexander Aldea had concluded with the Ottomans, provoking an Ottoman incursion against Wallachia in November.|$|E
50|$|The {{appeal was}} <b>dismissed</b> in a 6-0 ruling, while the {{cross-appeal}} was <b>dismissed</b> 5-1.|$|R

5|$|Assessments of Sorabji's music vary widely. While some, such as {{the pianist}} John Ogdon and the organist Kevin Bowyer, speak of him as {{comparable}} to such composers as Bach, Beethoven, Chopin and Messiaen, others <b>dismiss</b> him altogether. Reviews of concerts featuring Sorabji's music tend to be similarly mixed, some reviewers elevating him to the ranks of figures such as Debussy, and others describing his music as vacuous.|$|E
5|$|At some point, Cybi and Caffo parted company, {{possibly}} {{because of a}} disagreement between them, but {{possibly because}} his brother Gildas had insulted Maelgwn, who then forced Cybi to <b>dismiss</b> Caffo – both versions appear in the manuscript accounts. Thereafter, Caffo moved towards the south of Anglesey, where {{he was killed by}} shepherds from the area now called Newborough, perhaps avenging the insult on their king.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, there was common resentment against the reactionary attitudes {{prevailing}} in Court circles {{even before the}} uproar sparked by the notorious banquet precipitated the political aspects of the march. Deeper planners in the crowd spread the word that the king needed to <b>dismiss</b> his royal bodyguards entirely and replace them all with patriotic National Guardsmen, a line of argument that had a compelling resonance among Lafayette's soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the trial}} began, {{supporters}} of the defendants decided on a campaign of letter-writing and demonstrations: the CPUSA urged its members to bombard Truman with letters requesting that the charges be dropped. Later, supporters similarly flooded Judge Medina with telegrams and letters urging him to <b>dismiss</b> the charges.|$|E
5|$|Biographer Weissweiler {{does not}} <b>dismiss</b> the {{possibility}} that Busch's increasing alcohol dependence hindered self-criticism. He refused invitations to parties, and publisher Otto Basserman sent him to Wiedensahl to keep his alcohol problem undetected from those around him. Busch was also a heavy smoker, resulting in symptoms of severe nicotine poisoning in 1874. He began to illustrate drunkards more often.|$|E
5|$|CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) {{plans on}} firing Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{due to his}} missing work for acting gigs. However, Andy tells David he is resigning to pursue his dreams of stardom full-time, and David is {{relieved}} to not have to <b>dismiss</b> him. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) receives his black belt in karate from his new sensei (Michael Imperioli). Seeing Dwight's tenacity and devotion, David is inspired to make Dwight Andy's replacement.|$|E

5|$|Dioscorides then {{describes}} {{how to tell}} a good from a counterfeit preparation. He mentions the recommendations of other physicians, Diagoras (according to Eristratus), Andreas, and Mnesidemus, only to <b>dismiss</b> them as false and not borne out by experience. He ends {{with a description of}} how the liquid is gathered from poppy plants, and lists names used for it: chamaesyce, mecon rhoeas, oxytonon; papaver to the Romans, and wanti to the Egyptians.|$|E
5|$|Ecgric is a {{possible}} contender, as well as Rædwald, Eorpwald and Sigeberht, for being the East Anglian king who was buried within Mound 1 at Sutton Hoo. Rupert Bruce-Mitford {{suggests that it is}} perhaps unlikely that Ecgric’s successor Anna, a devout Christian, would have given him a ship burial, but he does not <b>dismiss</b> the theory entirely.|$|E
5|$|His next {{assignment}} was in Yekaterinburg in the Urals, {{where he was}} appointed second in command of a training school for non-commissioned officers attached to the Anglo-Russian Brigade. He found this post frustrating, having to <b>dismiss</b> {{nearly a third of}} his initial cadre on medical grounds, and struggling to get supplies and support from the White Army authorities. Despite this, he developed a rapport with his men and an admiration for the Russian soldier.|$|E
50|$|The {{trial court}} {{delivered}} judgment on 4 February 2010, <b>dismissing</b> the application and awarding costs to iiNet.

With Field on leave (his Senate appointment having been challenged), the Coalition had an effective majority of 30–29 in the Senate. The Coalition {{believed that if}} Whitlam could not deliver supply, and would not advise new elections, Kerr would have to <b>dismiss</b> him. Supply would run out on 30November.|$|E
5|$|In {{research}} following Hitler's death, {{a variety}} of claims have been made about Hitler's sexual orientation: that he was gay, bisexual, or asexual. Conclusive evidence is lacking, but most historians believe he was heterosexual. There {{is at least one}} claim that Hitler had an illegitimate child (named Jean-Marie Loret) with one of his lovers. Mainstream historians, such as Ian Kershaw, <b>dismiss</b> this as unlikely or impossible.|$|E
5|$|Nazi {{official}} Hans Frank {{suggested that}} Alois's {{mother had been}} employed as a housekeeper by a Jewish family in Graz, and that the family's 19-year-old son Leopold Frankenberger had fathered Alois. No Frankenberger was registered in Graz during that period, and no record has been produced of Leopold Frankenberger's existence, so historians <b>dismiss</b> the claim that Alois's father was Jewish.|$|E
50|$|In August 2007, President Mbeki and Health Minister Tshabalala-Msimang <b>dismissed</b> Deputy Health Minister Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge. Madlala-Routledge {{has been}} widely {{credited}} by medical professionals and AIDS activists. Although she was officially <b>dismissed</b> for corruption, it was widely held that she was <b>dismissed</b> for her more mainstream beliefs about AIDS and its relation with HIV.|$|R
50|$|Wrongful {{dismissal}} {{will tend}} to arise first as a claim by the employee so <b>dismissed.</b> Many jurisdictions provide tribunals or courts which will hear actions for wrongful dismissal.
