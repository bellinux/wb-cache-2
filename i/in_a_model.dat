5|$|Stanley Fischer (1977) {{responded to}} Thomas J. Sargent and Neil Wallace's {{monetary}} ineffectiveness proposition and showed how monetary policy could stabilize an economy even <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> with rational expectations. Fischer's model showed how monetary policy {{could have an}} impact <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> with long-term nominal wage contracts. John B. Taylor expanded on Fischer's work and found that monetary policy could have long-lasting effects—even after wages and prices had adjusted. Taylor arrived at this result by building on Fischer's model with the assumptions of staggered contract negotiations and contracts that fixed nominal prices and wage rates for extended periods. These early new Keynesian theories {{were based on the}} basic idea that, given fixed nominal wages, a monetary authority (central bank) can control the employment rate. Since wages are fixed at a nominal rate, the monetary authority can control the real wage (wage values adjusted for inflation) by changing the money supply and thus impact the employment rate.|$|E
5|$|The linear {{component}} is active when the tissue pressure exceeds ambient pressure by a given amount {{specific to the}} tissue compartment. When the tissue pressure drops below this cross-over criterion the tissue is modelled by exponential kinetics. During gas uptake, tissue pressure never exceeds ambient, so it is always modelled by exponential kinetics. This results <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> with the desired asymmetrical characteristics of slower washout than uptake.|$|E

5|$|After {{securing}} {{control over}} the Commonwealth, Báthory {{had a chance to}} devote himself to strengthening his authority, in which he was supported by his chancellor Jan Zamoyski, who would soon become one of the king's most trusted advisers. Báthory reorganised the judiciary by formation of legal tribunals (the Crown Tribunal in 1578 and the Lithuanian Tribunal in 1581). While this somewhat weakened the royal position, it was of little concern to Báthory, as the loss of power was not significant in the short term, and he was more concerned with the hereditary Hungarian throne. In exchange, the Sejm allowed him to raise taxes and push a number of reforms strengthening the military, including the establishment of the piechota wybraniecka, an infantry formation composed of peasants. Many of his projects aimed to modernize the Commonwealth army, reforming it <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> of Hungarian troops of Transylvania. He also founded the Academy of Vilnius, the third university in the Commonwealth, transforming a prior Jesuit college into a major university. He founded several other Jesuit colleges, and was active in propagating Catholicism, {{while at the same time}} being respectful of the Commonwealth policy of religious tolerance, issuing a number of decrees offering protection to Polish Jews, and denouncing any religious violence.|$|E
5|$|In {{the uniform}} cost model (suitable for {{analyzing}} {{the complexity of}} gcd calculation on numbers that fit into a single machine word), {{each step of the}} algorithm takes constant time, and Lamé's analysis implies that the total running time is also O(h). However, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> of computation suitable for computation with larger numbers, the computational expense of a single remainder computation in the algorithm can be as large as O(h2). In this case the total time for all of the steps of the algorithm can be analyzed using a telescoping series, showing that it is also O(h2). Modern algorithmic techniques based on the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm for fast integer multiplication can be used to speed this up, leading to quasilinear algorithms for the GCD.|$|E
5|$|The {{inclination}} {{distribution of}} Jupiter-family (or ecliptic) comets would become broader {{under the influence}} of Planet Nine. Jupiter-family comets originate primarily from the scattering objects, trans-Neptunian objects with semi-major axes that vary over time due to distant encounters with Neptune. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> including Planet Nine, the scattering objects that reach large semi-major axes dynamically interact with Planet Nine, increasing their inclinations. As a result, the population of the scattering objects, and the population of comets derived from it, is left with a broader inclination distribution. This inclination distribution is broader than is observed, in contrast to a five-planet Nice model without a Planet Nine that can closely match the observed inclination distribution.|$|E

25|$|Mice made {{deficient}} in their 12/15-lipoxygenase gene (Alox15) exhibit a prolonged inflammatory response along with various {{other aspects of}} a pathologically enhanced inflammatory response in experimental models of cornea injury, airway inflammation, and peritonitis. These mice also show an accelerated rate of progression of atherosclerosis whereas mice made to overexpress 12/15-lipoxygenase exhibit a delayed rate of atherosclerosis development. Alox15 overexpressing rabbits exhibited reduced tissue destruction and bone loss <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> of periodontitis. Finally, Control mice, but not 12/15-lipoxygense deficient mice responded to eicospentaenoic acid administration by decreasing the number of lesions <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> of endometriosis. These studies indicate that the suppression of inflammation is a major function of 12/15-lipoxygenase and the Specialized proresolving mediators it produces in rodents; although rodent 12/15-lipoxygenase differs from human ALOX15 in {{the profile of the}} PUFA metabolites that it produces as well as various other parameters (e.g. tissue distribution), these genetic studies allow that human ALOX15 and the specialized proresolving mediators it produces may play a similar major anti-inflammatory function in humans.|$|E
