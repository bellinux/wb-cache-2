For the most part, I was never thrilled with the results, so I figured I would give {{directing}} a shot. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> simple concept. Most of the scenes were featured at the amusement park, at a late-night outdoor celebration. I was really happy to be able to include O.D.B in the remix video.|$|E

Indeed, it was so downmarket that Munich, the country's third-largest city, had not hosted a single national team match since 1940.|$|E

Welles states that Corman [...] "had two camera crews on the set—that's why the picture, from a cinematic standpoint, {{is really not}} very well done. The two camera crews were pointed in opposite directions so that we got both angles, and then other shots were 'picked up' to use in between, to make it flow. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> fixed set and it was done {{sort of like a}} sitcom is done today, so it wasn't very difficult." ...|$|E
500|$|Kim Manners called [...] "Grotesque" [...] his {{favorite}} third-season episode and praised David Duchovny's performance on this episode, saying [...] "Duchovny drove himself, {{and he was}} brilliant in that show." [...] Manners also said of the episode: [...] "I think 'Grotesque' is a frightening show. I {{think it is a}} disturbing show, and I think that's why—for me—it's such a good show. We pulled it off making the viewer feel uneasy. I even found it a difficult show to watch. Yeah, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> dark hour of television and I would like to do more of those." [...] In order to get a proper feel for the episode, Manners listened to the music from the 1990 film Jacob's Ladder until his wife [...] "finally asked, 'Do we have to listen to that (bleeping) CD again?'" [...] Manners also theorized that the episode may have been the template for the show Millennium, which premiered on Fox the following television season.|$|E
500|$|Those reviewers who {{singled out}} the show's final segment, set after {{the return to}} Ohio, did so with compliments. Poniewozik wrote that the episode [...] "did a really fine job {{handling}} its epilogue, in which New Directions had their hopes crushed, went back to Lima—and found that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> awesome experience regardless. Brittany connected with Santana, a brief scene that reminded me how far both characters have come this season. Kurt didn't get a championship, but he has Blaine, {{and he has a}} taste of what life can be like for him after graduation." [...] Canning said it was a [...] "nice denouement, putting everyone at peace for having failed to reach the top ten at Nationals and getting their hopes high for next year." [...] Hankinson credited Brittany with some of the funniest lines in the episode as well as the most important scene—in the epilogue with Santana—and he was impressed with her lead vocals throughout. He concluded, [...] "She's the M.V.P. of the night and possibly the season." ...|$|E

500|$|An attacking {{right-handed}} middle-order batsman and a right-arm fast-medium bowler, Loxton {{spent much}} of his cricket career in the shadow of Miller, who played the same type of role. Upon Miller's death in 2004, he said [...] "I was in Keith's shadow all my career ... and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> big shadow." [...] First-class cricket resumed in 1945–46 {{after the end of the}} war, but Loxton failed to gain state selection during the season. He played his final VFL season in 1946 and was chosen in 12 of St Kilda’s 19 games, kicking 40 goals. However, his team only won two of these 12 matches, and finished second last. Loxton had a strong start to his final season, kicking 34 goals in the first 8 rounds. This included a career best of eight goals in another away win over Geelong. He also added six goals apiece against Footscray and Collingwood, but it was not enough to prevent defeats. However, Loxton missed three matches after the eighth round and upon his return, struggled and managed only six goals in his last four matches for St Kilda.|$|E
500|$|Between late December 1901 {{and early}} January 1902 Gallaher and his {{contingent}} {{were involved in}} a number of skirmishes. He described one incident where he had several Boer fighters in his sights, but did not have [...] "the heart" [...] to fire at them while they rescued one of their comrades. [...] Describing a later encounter to his sister, Gallaher wrote: [...] "We had a total of 22 killed and 36 injured and a few taken prisoners <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> mournful sight to see the Red Cross bearers cruising around the field fetching all the dead and wounded who were laying all over the place". By March 1902 Gallaher had reached the rank of squadron sergeant-major, and his contingent {{was on its way to}} Durban. There the unit boarded ship for New Zealand, but Gallaher stayed behind, transferring to the Tenth New Zealand Contingent. His new unit did not see active service in South Africa, and he returned with them to New Zealand in August 1902. For his service Gallaher received the Queen's South Africa Medal (Cape Colony, Orange Free State, and Transvaal Clasps), and King's South Africa Medal (South Africa 1901 and South Africa 1902 Clasps).|$|E
500|$|As with Miley and Ray Cyrus's last duet, [...] "Ready, Set, Don't Go" [...] (2007), [...] "Butterfly Fly Away" [...] {{describes}} a child's transition to adulthood. The song was written and produced by Glen Ballard and Alan Silvestri for the 2009 film [...] According to the film, when main character Miley Stewart (played by Miley Cyrus) was young, her father Robby Ray Stewart (played by Billy Ray Cyrus), would often {{tell her that}} while a caterpillar {{may not be able}} to move much, it can still dream about the butterfly it will one day be. This comment became a recurring motif in the film and provided the basis for the lyrics to [...] "Butterfly Fly Away", which use a caterpillar's metamorphosis as a metaphor for a child's coming of age. In Hannah Montana: The Movie, the Cyruses perform the song as their characters in [...] "a tender movie scene under a gazebo in the rain". Billy Ray said filming the scene was [...] "a pretty special moment. The song itself was written by Glen Ballard, a masterful songwriter who wrote 'Man in the Mirror' for Michael Jackson. I knew <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> special song [...] and it certainly comes at a nice spot in the movie." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Lisa Respers France of CNN felt that [...] "Laryngitis" [...] highlighted a trend of Glee storylines becoming progressively sadder, rather than comedic. She {{wrote that the}} plotlines came across as lecturing, and concluded: [...] "I still heart Glee, which is clearly {{one of the best}} shows on television right now. I just think they may want to lighten the life lessons a bit or spread them out more over several episodes rather than clobbering us all at once." [...] Henrik Batallones of BuddyTV wrote that he was uncertain what to make of the episode, noting: [...] "Sure, there were some high points, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> enjoyable watch, but unlike the last few episodes this one left me a little high and dry." [...] Batallones observed that the Sean storyline felt [...] "totally forced into the episode, making Rachel's epiphany [...] very forced and unnatural." [...] Entertainment Weekly Darren Franich was also troubled by the storyline, noting: [...] "It seems like the height of vanity to basically use this storyline to teach Rachel an important lesson about being herself. [...] Glee has used disabled actors before, and I think it's worth debating whether the show honors that or uses it shamelessly." ...|$|E
500|$|Valene's {{relationship}} with Gary {{is important to}} the understanding of her overall character. The Gary/Abby/Valene love triangle, which involved Gary cheating on Valene with Abby Cunningham – the show's main villain – was a monumental storyline for all three characters. Van Ark described the storyline:"There wasn’t really anything I could think of, but I will mention that Ted and I went in way early, whenever Donna Mills came on the show, and told David Jacobs that it made total sense that Gary would fall for Abby. I can’t believe I did that but it really provided me with some great stories. Because they were celebrating Donna Mills and she became the center but Gary and Val were supposed to be this enduring couple. Ted and I were saying Gary and Val should break up and Gary should go with Abby. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> big deal to break up the couple that the show began with. So (the producers) were going toward this, then they pulled away but eventually returned to it. David Jacobs was against it but we convinced him. And it was the longest running story on the show. It took a long time for them to get back together. Eight years." ...|$|E
500|$|The Beatles were {{performing}} at Liverpool's Cavern Club in November 1961 {{when they were}} introduced to Brian Epstein after a midday concert. Epstein was a homosexual, and according to biographer Philip Norman, one of Brian's reasons for wanting to manage the group {{was that he was}} physically attracted to Lennon. Almost as soon as Julian was born, Lennon went on holiday to Spain with Epstein, leading to speculation about their relationship. When he was later questioned about it, Lennon said, [...] "Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite. It was never consummated. But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> intense relationship. It was my first experience with a homosexual that I was conscious was homosexual. We used to sit in a café in Torremolinos looking at all the boys and I'd say, 'Do you like that one? Do you like this one?' I was rather enjoying the experience, thinking like a writer all the time: I am experiencing this." [...] Soon after their return from Spain—at McCartney's twenty-first birthday party in June 1963—Lennon physically attacked Cavern Club Master of ceremonies Bob Wooler for saying [...] "How was your honeymoon, John?" [...] The MC, known for his wordplay and affectionate but cutting remarks, was making a joke, but ten months had passed since Lennon's marriage, and the deferred honeymoon was still two months in the future. To Lennon, who was drunk at the time, the matter was simple: [...] "He called me a queer so I battered his bloody ribs in".|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Haunted" [...] was {{directed}} by Swedish film and music video director Jonas Åkerlund and styled by Dagmarette Yen and B. Åkerlend. It was shot using four cameras and {{in a period of}} two days. On November 15, 2013, Popjustice reported that one of the actors who was featured in the video, J-Hustle, shared a picture on his Twitter account while being on a five-day set for the filming. He added that a song with [...] "a slow vibe" [...] was played in the background during the shooting and that its potential name was [...] "Ghost Haunted". Beyoncé first discussed about the video with Åkerlend during a concert she had in Stockholm in 2013. Having invited him for the performance, the singer played several songs for the director afterwards and the pair went on to exchange several ideas about its concept. During an interview with Vulture, Åkerlend talked about the process, [...] "It was not like a solid plan of 'This is what I think we should do.' <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> long process. And she was traveling and touring, so we had time to bounce ideas back and forth, figure out what the best vision was. And meanwhile, she was shooting all these other videos and I wasn't really involved in what those other ideas were." [...] He noted that several ideas of the video which were initially conceived were similar with [...] "other videos that people were working on". Beyoncé conceived some of the initial ideas behind the looks and the scenarios for many of the rooms which were eventually shot. He also explained that the video contained many sexually explicit scenes and ideas when initially shot. However, he felt that the team managed to balance between the singer's look, her performance and a strong idea along with several other things. Åkerlund further noted that its concept remained largely unchanged as none of the big ideas were excluded. Beyoncé's look remained largely the same as the director pictured it before the filming of the video had started.|$|E
500|$|Dean-Charles Chapman, who portrayed King Tommen Baratheon, {{spoke about}} filming his death scene, saying [...] "I was jumping onto a crash mat. Height-wise, I think if I was {{standing}} on the floor, it was up to my chest. But the crash mat was pretty thick. I must have done that about 50 times. My face was pretty bruised up. My face took it a little bit." [...] Eugene Simon, who portrayed Lancel Lannister, also spoke about his death scene revealing about his discussions with Sapochnik, [...] "the note was when Lancel was dragging his body, {{there was a sense of}} someone who is trying to put aside their pain of being stabbed and being paralyzed as much as possible in order to try to defend what little hope there is left of trying to save the sept and also to save their life. It really only comes down to the very last few nanoseconds of footage that you realize the cause is lost." [...] Simon also stated about the filming of Jonathan Pryce's, who portrays the High Sparrow, final scene, [...] "we had a very big nice round of applause when that took place. I remember that scene very well; we had 200 or so supporting actors in there, all of whom were so committed. They stayed there all day and did wonderful reactions to all the really intense bits. When the first part of the bomb goes off, all of them really, really performed that there was a full-on nuclear explosion going on underneath them." [...] He continued, [...] "We had a big round of applause and celebration after that scene was done because I think we all knew it was going to be pretty monumentous. We said goodbye to countless Tyrells, Kevan Lannister my father, the High Sparrow and dozens of other. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> extraordinary day." [...] In regards to the non-verbal exchange between Jaime and Cersei Lannister when she is sitting on the Iron Throne, Sapochnik stated [...] "I thought that non-verbal exchange was a very interesting moment but it wasn't clear from the script what exactly Benioff and Weiss wanted. So we just tried a few things, following our noses, drawing from what we knew about these characters and what you see was one of the versions we shot. Interestingly in the edit I still couldn't find a version I felt worked so I actually dropped the moment entirely out of my cut but David and Dan reinstated and to great effect. In fact, I can't really remember the sequence without it anymore. I think he's saying 'don't' and she's saying 'too late.'" [...] He continued [...] "The wonderful thing about filmmaking is you make and remake your film or episode a number of times over the duration of its existence. Firstly in the script stage, second is in prep when you plan how you're going to execute it. Third is in production when you actually get there and have to change everything and finally, in the edit, when you realize what you thought something meant means something totally different when put before or after another juxtaposing or complimentary image." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{prospects}} who {{may have}} never had a serious look were given chances they thought they never would have. Undrafted journeyman Chris Minard had been signed with Alaska for his third season in the ECHL when the lockout allowed Davis Payne to assign him on the same line as Gomez at the Aces. Gomez saw a gem that led to the 2005 ECHL All-Star Game, and a top ECHL player that season; the pairing led to Gomez giving Minard a shot after the lockout ended, and he played his way into the AHL, and eventually signing a two-way contract with the Pittsburgh Penguins, receiving in 2007–08 his first call-up to the NHL. Minard said about the experience, [...] "That's when I learned a lot about being a goal-scorer, playing with a guy like that who can pass the puck. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> cool experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lancashire batted on {{for another}} 49 overs, scoring 195 for 6 declared, and setting Somerset a target of 247 runs in 31 overs. Paul Horton and Loye put on 94 for the first wicket. But all in all, taking 61 overs to score 195 was hardly {{declaration}} batting. Somerset did not go for the win (which would have meant scoring at well over 7 an over), and made 69 for 3 off 22.3 overs before play ended because of bad light. Lancashire's Mal Loye, who fell just short of his century on 92 in the second innings to go with his 53 in the first said, [...] "To {{get a couple of}} fifties against a pretty good attack is a good start. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> difficult pitch to bat on during the first day but it got easier as the match wore on and I was disappointed to miss out.
