50|$|In the United States, early {{societies}} {{were able}} to easily expel individuals deemed undesirable from public space through vagrancy laws {{and other forms of}} banishment. In the 1960s and 1970s, however, these exclusion orders were denounced as unconstitutional in America and consequently were rejected by the US Supreme Court. The introduction of broken windows theory in the 1980s generated a dramatic transformation in the concepts used in forming policies in order to circumvent the previous issue of unconstitutionality. According to the theory, the environment of a particular space signals its health to the public, including to potential vandals. By maintaining an organized environment, individuals are dissuaded from causing disarray in that particular location. However, environments filled with disorder, such as broken windows or graffiti, indicate an inability for the neighborhood to supervise itself, therefore leading to an increase in criminal activity. Instead of focusing on the built environment, policies substantiated by the Broken Windows Theory overwhelmingly emphasize undesirable human behavior as the <b>environmental</b> <b>disorder</b> prompting further crime. The civility laws, originating in the late 1980s and early 1990s, provide an example of the usage of this latter aspect of the Broken Windows Theory as legitimization for discriminating against individuals considered disorderly in order to increase the sense of security in urban spaces. These civility laws effectively criminalize activities considered undesirable, such as sitting or lying on sidewalks, sleeping in parks, urinating or drinking in public, and begging, in an attempt to force the individuals doing these and other activities to relocate to the margins of society. Not surprisingly then, these restrictions disproportionally affect the homeless.|$|E

This study was performed to test the hypothesis that endometriosis occurs more often in women exposed to higher concentrations of dioxin-like compounds (DLC) than in those women exposed to lower concentrations. Plasma samples collected prior to laparoscopic surgery from 96 women with endometriosis and 106 control patients with a normal pelvis were measured for DLC concentrations using the dioxin-responsive chemical-activated luciferase expression bioassay. The results showed that concentration (mean+/-SD) of DLC was marginally higher in patients with endometriosis (22. 3 +/- 9. 3 pg CALUX-TEQ/g lipid) than in controls (20. 5 +/- 10. 8 pg). After categorization of patients in a group with 'low' plasma concentrations (75 th centile) of DLC, the age-adjusted odds ratio to have endometriosis was 2. 44 (95 % CI 1. 04 - 5. 70; P= 0. 04) for women with high concentrations of DLC and it increased to 3. 01 (95 % CI 1. 06 - 9. 04; P= 0. 03) when only women with moderate severe endometriosis were considered.

40|$|Many {{industrial}} activities result in heavy metal dispersion {{in the environment}} worldwide. Heavy metals are persistent contaminants, which get into contact with living organisms and humans creating serious <b>environmental</b> <b>disorders.</b> Metals are commonly removed from wastewaters by means of physical-chemical processes, but often microbes are also enrolled to control metal fate. When microorganisms are used as biosorbents for metal entrapment, a process called “biosorption” occurs. Biosorption efficiency is significantly influenced by many parameters such as environmental factors, the sorbing material and the metal species to be removed, and highly depends on whether microbial cultures are alive or dead. Moreover, the presence of biofilm agglomerates is of major importance for metal uptake onto extracellular polymeric substances. In this chapter, {{the effect of the}} above mentioned variables on biosorption performance was reviewed. Among the environmental factors, pH rules metal mobility and speciation. Temperature has a lower influence with an optimal value ranging between 20 and 35 °C. The co-presence of more metals usually decreases the biosorption efficiency of each single metal. Biosorption efficiency can be enhanced by using living microorganisms due to the interaction with active functional groups and the occurrence of transport phenomena into the cells. The existing mathematical modeling approaches used for heavy metal biosorption were overviewed. Several isotherms, obtained in batch conditions, are available for modeling biosorption equilibria and kinetics. In continuous systems, most of the models are used to predict the breakthrough curves.

Mice were maintained under controlled environ-mental conditions and fed a standard diet. Retrospective analysis of environmental data (relative humidity, temperature) was carried out.

While their remarkable electrical and mechanical properties have been well studied, the optical properties of semiconducting SWNTs are continuously emerging with recently reported developments such as greatly enhanced fluorescence yields and highly efficient nanotube photodiodes. The scope of optoelectronic applications for SWNTs depends critically on a detailed understanding of their highly congested absorption features consisting of strongly bound excitonic (E 11, E 22, etc.), vibronic and dark state transitions. Until recently, carbon nanotubes consisted of highly inhomogeneous distributions of tubes types that made advanced spectroscopic studies impractical. Enabled by samples highly enriched in specific tube types, we investigate carbon nanotubes photophysics in real-time by applying {{a wide range of}} techniques including transient absorption, photon echo and 2 D Fourier transform spectroscopy. Through detailed analysis and simulation of these femtosecond nonlinear results, fundamental properties concerning excitonic structure, exciton-phonon interactions, and the dynamics of coherent excitons for these quasi one-dimensional nanomaterials are revealed. Population relaxation dynamics in SWNTs are probed from the visible to mid-infrared regions using transient absorption or grating spectroscopy. Measurements in mid-IR region reveal a broad excited state absorption feature consistent with previously unobserved intra-excitonic transitions and bound vibrational states. Simulation of visible and near-IR transient absorption results suggest efficient exciton-exciton annihilation occurring by both one-dimensional diffusion or delocalized overlap of coherent excitons depending upon the timescale, state transitions, or temperature investigated (4. 4 to 292 K). Throughout all the measurements reported, strong contributions from exciton-exciton scattering processes are evident. The timescales for pure optical dephasing (and the corresponding homogeneous lineshape) were obtained through photon echo measurements. Surprisingly long room temperature dephasing times of 285 fs are reported, suggesting unusually weak exciton-phonon coupling and an inhomogeneously broadened absorption lineshape.

40|$|Among the {{greatest}} challenges {{of the twenty-first century}} is the rapid growth of cities. The growth of most municipalities has remained unplanned and uncontrolled. Unmanageable development in developing countries has given rise to <b>environmental</b> <b>disorders</b> in the built-up settlements. Municipal solid waste management in particular, is now a fear-provoking assignment for the municipal establishments who are lacking in capacity to confront the municipal solid waste issue. The main objective of carrying out this research is to see how urban planning can help improve municipal solid waste issues in Greater Jos municipal area. It defines the municipal solid waste problem and identifies a number of specific planning drivers as the factors responsible for lack of improvement in the municipal solid waste management situation. A mixed method approach was used for the empirical analysis which combined both interviews and questionnaire data from senior government officials, industry stakeholders and residential neighbourhoods, collected with observational and documentary data, in order to investigate the solid waste issue. Major problems identified in this research are: (i) municipalities are undergoing deterioration of solid waste conditions but the local, state and federal governments are lacking adequate planning to deal with the circumstances (ii) apart from quite a lot of causes of the municipal solid wastes crisis can be known, the political commitment to urban planning is lacking which serves as the basis of the deteriorating situation in Nigerian municipalities and (iii) relationship exists between poor planning and municipal solid waste management delivery of collection services and disposal amenities. Individual municipal solid waste management strategy alone was found to produce unplanned and uncoordinated management of waste issues. Collaboration to produce a joint municipal solid waste management plan has been recommended as a good practice...|$|R
