40|$|W. S. Hemp {{established}} an optimality criterion for designing minimum weight structures that employ materials with different strength in compression and tension following A. G. M. Michell 2 ̆ 7 s work. W. Prager extended the optimality criterion for designs with materials with different densities. The {{first part of}} this dissertation brings together a full set of analytical tools to generate structural layouts which satisfy these dual-material optimality conditions. ^ Chapter 3 is concerned with methods to suppress local and global instability of least-weight structures. Perforated webs placed between structural members, structural member shape optimization and light-weight <b>foam</b> <b>inserts</b> are methods investigated in the research to address the instability problems. Simply supported least-weight arch beams were designed and mechanically tested. The experimental results were compared with FEA. Experimental results and FEA predictions were found to be in good agreement with the theoretical predictions, except for the perforated web design in which experimental and FEA results were close agreement, but were found to perform in a sub-optimal manner. In addition to the beam designs and experiments, a minimum-weight cantilever design was used to measure the effectiveness of <b>foam</b> <b>inserts.</b> Both experimental and FEA results showed that either shape optimization or <b>foam</b> <b>inserts</b> can be used for effective suppression of instability. ^ In Chapter 4 matrix operator methods proposed by S. Srithongchai to generate optimal layouts with straight boundaries were extended to include curved boundaries. A Matlab program originally written by Srithongchai was generalized to generate layouts for cantilevers with curved boundaries by using this method. ^ In Chapter 5 the design of an arch structure with a continuous profiled-thickness web, as described by Kozlowski and Mroz is analyzed. The analysis showed that a continuous design cannot produce an efficient least-weight structure. ^ In Chapter 6 optimal layouts with two and three-bar trusses were investigated for two alternate loading cases. A Matlab program was written to determine the minimum-weight from alternative structures. As suggested by Nagtegaal and Prager, the addition of a third member was found to reduce the total weight. However, a case study given in Chapter 6 suggests that {{it may be possible to}} find 3 -bar structures of lower weight. ...|$|R
5000|$|Geoffrey Farmer creates installation-based artworks using {{combinations}} {{of a broad}} range of elements, including: drawing, photography, video, sculpture, performance, and found materials. Farmer’s work offers an exceptionally subtle take on the legacies of minimalist and postminimalist art. Minimalism emphasized the artwork's ability to instill in the viewer a powerful sense of their own presence; Farmer's work begins with this idea of the art gallery as a site of phenomenological experience. Postminimalism represents a refinement of minimalism in the way it emphasizes the role the gallery context plays in creating the meaning of an artwork. Farmer adds to both traditions by focusing on the contingent nature of meaning itself, especially emphasizing its fragile and elusive nature. Contingency in Farmer's art extends to the strategies he devises to foster a self-reflexive engagement with his work. Whereas minimalist artists, such as Donald Judd and Dan Flavin, were said by art critic Michael Fried to theatricalize the gallery-going experience, Farmer uses the idioms of theatre and performance as analogies of the process of meaning construction. This places him within the international trend, in which [...] "installation art is a theatrical set without a stage play to give it meaning." [...] For instance, Farmer's piece Hunchback Kit (2000-7 at the Tate uses a hard shell case with custom <b>foam</b> <b>insert</b> to house props for the staging performances of The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Farmer creates the art exhibition as a set of components made available for the viewer's interpretation. In this process, he casts himself {{in the role of the}} 'artist', continuing to add to and transform an exhibition during the time it is on view. In For Every Jetliner Used in an Artwork… (2006), for instance, Farmer presented a video in the exhibition of himself working to alter an installation during the night while the show is closed. By explicitly portraying the exhibition as being 'in process', Farmer ensures that [...] "a degree of openness and instability is built in to his work." [...] According to Mark Clintberg writing in The Drawing Room, London for Canadian Art International Farmer's work The Last Two Million Years(2007), takes the ephemerality of time as its theme, making small delicate sculptures from the pages of an Encyclopedia. Creating hybrid figurative objects out of disparate historical time periods, Farmer undoes the fixity of museological display and the agreed sequence of historical events. In 2013, Farmer was awarded the Gershon Iskowitz Prize for his outstanding contribution to the visual arts in Canada. He is represented by the Catriona Jeffries Gallery, Vancouver.|$|E

The majority of reported POVL cases are associated with spine surgery conducted in the prone position (67 %) (1).

Our goal was to provide a clinically practical method for measuring intraocular pressure, ocular perfusion pressure, and ocular perfusion (using digital retinal vessel/optic disk imaging), so that clinicians may be guided in preventing POVL. Limited access to a prone surgical patient’s eyes makes it challenging to obtain safe, physiologic ocular measurements.

The modules are wedge-shaped canisters designed to minimize the mechanical stresses that occur during the phase change of the lithium fluoride phase change material. Nickel foam inserts were used in some of the canisters to provide thermal conductivity enhancement and to distribute the void volume. Two canisters, one with a nickel <b>foam</b> <b>insert,</b> and one without, were thermally cycled in various orientations in a fluidized bed furnace. The only measurable impact of the nickel foam was seen when the back and short sides of the canister were insulated to simulate operation in the advanced receiver design. In tests with insulation, the furnace to back side delta T was larger in the canister with the nickel <b>foam</b> <b>insert,</b> probably due to the radiant absorptivity of the nickel. However, the differences in the temperature profiles of the two canisters were small, and in many cases the profiles matched fairly well. Computed Tomography (CT) was successfully used to nondestructively demarcate void locations in the canisters. Finally, canister dimensional stability, which was measured throughout the thermal cycling test program with an inspection fixture was satisfactory with a maximum change of 0. 635 mm (0. 025 in.) ...|$|E

40|$|Extrathoracic {{deposition}} of inhaled particles (i. e., {{in the head}} and throat) is an important exposure route for many hazardous materials. Current best practices for exposure assessment of aerosols in the workplace involve particle size selective sampling methods based on particle penetration into the human respiratory tract (i. e., inhalable or respirable sampling). However, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has recently adopted particle deposition sampling conventions (ISO 13138), including conventions for extrathoracic (ET) deposition into the anterior nasal passage (ET 1) and the posterior nasal and oral passages (ET 2). For this study, polyurethane foam was used as a collection substrate inside an inhalable aerosol sampler to provide an estimate of extrathoracic particle deposition. Aerosols of fused aluminum oxide (five sizes, 4. 9 µm– 44. 3 µm) were used as a test dust in a low speed (0. 2 m/s) wind tunnel.
