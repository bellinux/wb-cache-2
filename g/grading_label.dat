30|$|Both Energy Efficiency <b>Grade</b> <b>Label</b> and Korea Eco-Label {{have been}} used since 1992. A total of 24 types of product are covered by Energy Efficiency <b>Grade</b> <b>Label,</b> which is {{only about half the}} number of items covered by Korea Eco-Label. However, our results suggest that Energy Efficiency <b>Grade</b> <b>Label</b> had a greater effect on PI. This {{indicates}} that general consumers consider eco-labeling in their PI because the eco-label is more privately valuable. Furthermore, Energy Efficiency <b>Grade</b> <b>Label</b> provides information on energy costs that must be paid by consumers.|$|R
30|$|The {{stronger}} {{effect of}} PV appears much clearer when {{the results of}} each label are examined in detail. Energy Efficiency <b>Grade</b> <b>Label</b> was more effective than Korea Eco-Label on PI. Part of the gap between Energy Efficiency <b>Grade</b> <b>Label</b> and Korea Eco-Label was observed in the path from PV to LA. The PV gap between Energy Efficiency <b>Grade</b> <b>Label</b> and Korea Eco-Label was 3.13 without and 2.8 with a green card, which was relatively high compared with the SV gap between both labels. The SV gap between Energy Efficiency <b>Grade</b> <b>Label</b> and Korea Eco-Label was 0.81 without and 1.38 with a green card. The larger PV gap between Energy Efficiency <b>Grade</b> <b>Label</b> and Korea Eco-Label resulted in a larger gap in the path to LA.|$|R
30|$|Energy Efficiency <b>Grade</b> <b>Label</b> is a {{mandatory}} program {{operated by the}} Korea Energy Management Corporation (KEMCO) and is supervised under the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) (KEMCO 2014). This label indicates energy consumption, which increases from grade 1, the lowest, to grade 5, the highest. Products that fail to meet the Energy Efficiency <b>Grade</b> <b>Label</b> requirements are banned from sale. The criteria for this label are continuously revised; e.g., CO 2 emissions and annual energy expenses have recently been added. As of 2014, 24 types of products are covered by this program. Even though it is an eco-label, Energy Efficiency <b>Grade</b> <b>Label</b> also provides privately beneficial information (KEMCO 2014).|$|R

30|$|The SV and PV of Energy Efficiency <b>Grade</b> <b>Label</b> were 16.15 and 15.99, respectively. SV and PV of Korea Eco-Label {{without a}} green card were 15.34 and 12.86, respectively. With {{a green card}}, SV and PV of Korea Eco-Label were 14.77 and 13.19, respectively. The results {{revealed}} that in all cases, SV was larger than PV. However, the path loading from SV to LA was smaller than that from PV to LA in all cases. Regarding Energy Efficiency <b>Grade</b> <b>Label,</b> the path loading from SV to LA was 4.68, while that from PV to LA was 9.11. Regarding Korea Eco-Label without a green card, the path loading from SV to LA was 4.45, but that from PV to LA was 7.33. Regarding Korea Eco-Label with a green card, SV to LA was 4.28, but perceived private value to label attitude was 7.52. These results suggest that although consumers {{are aware of the}} public benefits of eco-labeled products, this awareness does not promote a positive attitude. In contrast, PV of eco-label had a more marked effect on LA. In addition, the path loading from PV to PI was 5.92, 4.76, and 4.88 for Energy Efficiency <b>Grade</b> <b>Label,</b> Korea Eco-Label without, and Korea Eco-Label with a green card, respectively. Therefore, the total effect of PV on PI was high. The path from LA to PI was 7.59, 6.48, and 6.49 for Energy Efficiency <b>Grade</b> <b>Label,</b> Korea Eco-Label without, and Korea Eco-Label with a green card, respectively.|$|R

Energy Efficiency <b>Grade</b> <b>Label</b> provides information regarding the annual energy cost to be paid by the consumer from using the product, which is private value. In contrast, Korea Eco-Label provides eco-information in relation to life-cycle assessment, which is social value. In Korea, green credit cards provide a financial incentive for the consumer to purchase eco-labeled products, thus converting social value into private value. Accordingly, in the second stage, we investigate the consumer response to each eco-label.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three stand-alone papers, each of which assesses a policy incentive that might alter the socio-economic gap in university enrollment in England; these incentives are encouragement, <b>grade</b> <b>labels,</b> and money, respectively. The rationale for examining these influences comes from a diverse range of theoretical backgrounds. In contrast, the analytical procedure used in each paper comes from the same empirical tradition, namely the Neyman-Rubin causal model, which quantifies {{the impact of a}} given incentive by determining counterfactual scenarios to estimate the difference in outcomes stemming from either the absence or the presence of a given incentive. As a set, these chapters demonstrate the multi-faceted nature of inequalities in access to higher education. By working from varied theoretical traditions, I provide evidence for a range of conceptualizations of behavior and influencing factors. My emphasis on socio-economic class disparities should not mask {{the fact that there are}} numerous sources of disadvantage that are likely to act in mutually dependent and re-enforcing ways. Yet, even when focusing on a single element of inequality, my findings demonstrate that many factors play a role in shaping disparities...|$|R

40|$|A {{survey of}} 52 {{smallholder}} fresh produce farmers {{was conducted in}} the Gauteng province of South Africa to grasp how risk and its management affect the mainstreaming of smallholder farmers into formal, high-value markets. The study employed a supply chain analysis approach, which focused on the functions and risks that occur along the fresh produce chain. The results highlight the risks that impede the participation of smallholder farmers in formal, high-value chains. At the production level, risk is prominent from input procurement through to the post-harvest stage of the chains. At the retail and consumption level, risks {{are linked to the}} adherence to quality and quantity standards, including prescribed packaging, <b>grading,</b> <b>labelling</b> and traceability and transport requirements. As a result of these risks across the formal chain, smallholder farmers often resort to distributing their products in low-value informal markets. The consequence is that smallholder farmers tend to remain trapped in poverty, in part, because of their risk appetites and their ability to bear risk. 8 Further research is required in the areas pertaining to smallholder farmers’ risk appetite and risk-bearing ability and mechanisms to deal with the particular risks in the value chain that impede their all-round ability to escape the “smallholder dilemma”.

Estimates for IUdR-DNA incorporation in tumor tissue (Ki) required pharmacokinetic modeling and fitting of the 0 - 48 min dynamically acquired data to correct the 24 -h image data for residual, nonincorporated radioactivity that did not clear from the tissue during the 24 -h period after IUdR injection. Standard uptake values (SUVs) and tumor:brain activity ratios (Tm:Br) were also calculated from the 24 -h image data. The Ki, SUV, and Tm/Br values were related to tumor type and <b>grade,</b> tumor <b>labeling</b> index, and survival after the PET scan, The plasma half-life of [I- 124]IUdR was short (2 - 3 min), and the arterial plasma input function was similar between patients (48 +/- 12 SUV*min). Plasma clearance of the major radiolabeled metabolite ([I- 124]iodide) varied somewhat between patients and was markedly prolonged in one patient with renal insufficiency. It was apparent from our analysis that a sizable fraction (15 - 93 %) of residual nonincorporated radioactivity (largely [I- 124]iodide) remained in the tumors after the 24 -h washout period, and this fraction varied between the different tumor groups. Because the SUV and Tm:Br ratio values reflect both IUdR-DNA incorporated and exchangeable nonincorporated radioactivity, any residual nonincorporated radioactivity will amplify their values and distort their significance and interpretation. This was particularly apparent in the meningioma and glioblastoma multiforme groups of tumors. Mean tumor Ki values ranged between 0. 5 +/- 0. 9 (meningiomas) and 3. 9 +/- 2. 3 mu l/min/g (peak value for glioblastoma multiforme, GEM). Comparable SW and Tm:Br values at 24 h ranged from 0. 13 +/- 0. 03 to 0. 29 +/- 0. 19 and from 2. 0 +/- 0. 6 to 6. 1 +/- 1. 5 for meningiomas and peak GBMs, respectively. Thus, the range of values was much greater for Ki (similar to 8 -fold) compared with that for SUV (similar to 2. 2 -fold) and Tm:Br (similar to 3 -fold). The expected relationships between Iii, SUV, and Tm:Br and other measures of tumor proliferation (tumor type and <b>grade,</b> <b>labeling</b> index, and patient survival) were observed. However, greater image specificity and significance of the SUV and Tm:Br values would be obtained by achieving greater washout and clearance of the exchangeable fraction of residual (background) radioactivity in the tumors, i. e., by increased hydration and urinary clearance and possibly by imaging later than 24 h after [I- 124]IUdR administration...|$|R

40|$|Multi-label was {{introduced}} {{as an extension}} of multi-class classification. The aim is to predict a set of classes (called labels in this context) instead of a single one, namely the set of relevant labels. If membership to the set of relevant labels is defined to a certain degree, the learning task is called graded multi-label classification. These learning tasks {{can be seen as a}} set of ordinal classifications. Hence, recommender systems can be considered as multi-label classification tasks. In this paper, we present a new type of nondeterministic learner that, for each instance, tries to predict at the same time the true <b>grade</b> for each <b>label.</b> When the classification is uncertain for a label, however, the hypotheses predict a set of consecutive grades, i. e., an interval. The goal is to keep the set of predicted grades as small as possible; while still containing the true grade. We shall see that these classifiers take advantage of the interrelations of labels. The result is that, with quite narrow intervals, it is possible to obtain dramatic improvements in the number of right predictions compared with those achieved by a state-of-the-art deterministic learner which always predicts only one <b>grade</b> for all <b>labels...</b>|$|R
