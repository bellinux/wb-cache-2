5|$|Conversely, DST can {{adversely}} affect farmers, parents of young children, and others whose hours are {{set by the}} sun and they have traditionally opposed the practice, although some <b>farmers</b> <b>are</b> neutral. One reason why farmers oppose DST is that grain is best harvested after dew evaporates, so when field hands arrive and leave earlier in summer their labor is less valuable. Dairy <b>farmers</b> <b>are</b> another group who complain of the change. Their cows {{are sensitive to the}} timing of milking, so delivering milk earlier disrupts their systems. Today some farmers' groups are in favor of DST.|$|E
5|$|Japan's small {{agricultural}} sector, however, is {{also highly}} subsidized and protected, with government regulations that favor small-scale cultivation instead of large-scale agriculture as practiced in North America.

5|$|In {{the good}} time coming, the refining, elevating, and {{strengthening}} influences of high intellectual and aesthetic culture {{will be considered}} as desirable in the agricultural profession {{as they are in}} medicine, law or theology...

5|$|As {{the years}} pass, the rural area {{gives way to}} a more {{urbanized}} setting. New buildings and highways spring up, more housing developments are built, and the <b>farmers</b> <b>are</b> pushed out. Though much of the wildlife has left and hunting grows increasingly difficult, Tod stays because it is his home range. The other foxes that remain become unhealthy scavengers, and their natures changelife-bonds with their mates are replaced by promiscuity, couples going their separate ways once the mating act is over. The Master has lost most of his own land, and the only dog he owns now is Copper. Each winter they still hunt Tod, and {{in an odd way}} he looks forward to it as the only aspect of his old life that remains.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} study investigate Arable Food production in Plateau State, which follows four {{pattern of the}} land tenure system namely; the Traditional inheritance Tenure System, the gift tenure system, the Purchase Tenure system and Hired Land tenure system. The {{purpose of this study}} was to empirically establish whether land tenure as an institution contributes to the observed Arable crop productivity differentials among Plateau State farmers. The study used a random sampling technique to obtain a sample of sixty farmers each from the three Agro-ecological zones of the State. Data were collected from the 2012 / 2013 production year using questionnaires administered to farmers at villages in QuaanPan, Langtang South, Mangu, Bokkos, Jos-East, and Jos-South local government areas. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Stochastic Production Frontier Analysis. The result also shows that the profitability index for Inherited land <b>farmers</b> <b>was</b> 1. 35, for gift <b>farmers</b> <b>was</b> 2. 14, for Purchased <b>farmers</b> <b>was</b> 3. 76 and Hired <b>farmers</b> <b>was</b> 2. 43. The mean technical efficiency of Inherited land <b>farmers</b> <b>was</b> 61 %, for gift land <b>farmers</b> <b>was</b> 59 %, for Purchased land <b>farmers</b> <b>was</b> 84 % and for Hired land <b>farmers</b> <b>was</b> 77 %. The results confirmed the existence of differentials in crop yields of farmer’s base on tenure holdings with tenure security found to influence land improvements. Therefore, a need for the review of the land tenure act of 1978 in order to clearly and sufficiently redefine tenure rights on farm Lands so, as to promote farmers productivity...|$|R

5|$|Pesticides {{are applied}} to crops by {{agricultural}} aircraft, tractor-mounted crop sprayers or as seed dressings to control pests. However, successful control by pesticides is not easy; the right formulation must be chosen, the timing is often critical, the method of application is important, adequate coverage and retention on the crop are necessary. The killing of natural enemies of the target pest should be minimised. This is particularly important in countries where there are natural reservoirs of pests and their enemies in the countryside surrounding plantation crops, and these co-exist in a delicate balance. Often in less-developed countries, the crops are well adapted to the local situation and no pesticides are needed. Where progressive <b>farmers</b> <b>are</b> using fertilisers to grow improved crop varieties, these are often more susceptible to pest damage, but the indiscriminate application of pesticides may be detrimental in the longer term.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{efforts to}} revive {{interest}} in the breed, numbers steadily declined {{in the years before}} 1988. In 1995, there were 33 stallions in service; in 1996 this number remained the same and by 1998 it had declined to 30. In 2004, there were 111 breeders and 119 Trait du Nord foals were registered. By 2007 and 2008 there were only 17 stallions registered, a number which is exposing the breed to a dangerous increase in inbreeding. To combat this danger, <b>farmers</b> <b>are</b> cross breeding the Trait du Nord with approved Belgian and Dutch horses. The number of farmers breeding the Trait du Nord decreased from 150 to 125 in 2002, then to 92 in 2007 and 86 in 2008. After birth rates remained relatively steady in the 1990s, they began to drop in the 2000s, declining from 176 in 2000 to 100 in 2005 and just 75 in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Farm incomes {{have fallen}} {{over the years}} as a result of cheap food {{policies}} in the United Kingdom, the lowering of world commodity prices and the removal of production-based subsidies. Particularly hard hit have been the incomes of hill farms in Wales which averaged £15,000 in 2014, as against £23,000 for lowland livestock farms and £59,000 for dairy farms. The labour force has been dwindling for many years as a result of increased mechanisation and changes in farming practices. Fewer <b>farmers</b> <b>are</b> needed today because they are able to produce more food from their land. Hay is no longer the main source of winter feed for livestock and has largely been replaced by silage, particularly baled silage wrapped in film that can be handled mechanically. This has reduced the manpower needed on farms, and there has been an increase of use by farmers of specialised contractors who provide services in silage making, harvesting and fencing. Another problem facing Welsh farmers is their distance from the main distribution centres used by supermarkets which are mostly located near centres of population in England.|$|E

25|$|Producers {{organize}} and strive for Fair Trade certification for several reasons, either through religious ties, wants for social justice, wants for autonomy, political liberalization, or {{simply because they}} want to be paid more for their labor efforts and products. <b>Farmers</b> <b>are</b> more likely to identify with organic farming than Fair Trade farming practices because organic farming is a very visible way that these <b>farmers</b> <b>are</b> different than their neighbors and it actually influences the way they farm.
