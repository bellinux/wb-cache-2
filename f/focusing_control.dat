5000|$|Due to {{its large}} success, {{as early as}} the end of 1967 a luxury and a beginners variant of the Rollei 35 were planned. However, because of the {{production}} shift to Singapore, it was not until 1971 that the computation of a five-elements lens was assigned to Zeiss. This Sonnar f 2.8 / 40 mm lens was to be fitted with a front lens <b>focusing</b> <b>control,</b> like the Tessar, providing a similar mounting in the sliding tube. Only the two front lenses were to move when focusing. But, when finished, the lens did not focus sharply enough at close distances, and mass production had to be delayed by a whole year. The project was stopped and Zeiss designed a new lens with <b>focusing</b> <b>control</b> by moving the whole lens. Rollei's chief of development, Richard Weiß, concluded: [...] "We've got into a precarious loss-making situation because of this. The developers have learned that, in the future, they must examine lenses, even if made by Carl Zeiss, with more scepticism." [...] The tools for producing the new shuttermechanism were built by Prontor, a Zeiss subsidiary company in Calmbach, which had already taken over the manufacturing of the former shutter from Compur (another Zeiss subsidiary).|$|E

40|$|Malaria {{transmission}} is spatially heterogeneous. This reduces {{the efficacy of}} control strategies, but <b>focusing</b> <b>control</b> strategies on clusters or 'hotspots' of transmission may be highly effective. Among 1500 homesteads in coastal Kenya we calculated (a) the fraction of febrile children with positive malaria smears per homestead, and (b) {{the mean age of}} children with malaria per homestead. These two measures were inversely correlated, indicating that children in homesteads at higher transmission acquire immunity more rapidly. This inverse correlation increased gradually with increasing spatial scale of analysis, and hotspots of febrile malaria were identified at every scale. We found hotspots within hotspots, down to the level of an individual homestead. Febrile malaria hotspots were temporally unstable, but 4 km radius hotspots could be targeted for 1 month following 1 month periods of surveillance. DOI: [URL]...|$|E

This testing {{was part of a}} program that demonstrated, for the first time, successful active combustor instability control in an aircraft gas turbine engine-like environment. The controls method is called Adaptive Sliding Phasor Averaged Control. Testing of the control method has been conducted in an experimental rig with different configurations designed to simulate combustors with instabilities of about 530 and 315 Hz. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in suppressing combustor instabilities. In addition, a dramatic improvement in suppression of the instability was achieved by <b>focusing</b> <b>control</b> on the second harmonic of the instability.

The morphology and behavior of mammalian cells is determined by an interaction between signals from the intracellular matrix and the cellular responses.

By measuring waste, activity rating, cycle time and cost, the System aims to provide accurate information to site management so that actions can be taken to correct the identified problems or to reestablish the process on its course. In order to adapt Lean Production to construction peculiarities, a bridge was built between traditional practices and new developments.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} ongoing {{testing of}} an adaptive control method to suppress high frequency thermo-acoustic instabilities like {{those found in}} lean-burning, low emission combustors that are being developed for future aircraft gas turbine engines. The method called Adaptive Sliding Phasor Averaged Control, was previously tested in an experimental rig designed to simulate a combustor with an instability of about 530 Hz. Results published earlier, and briefly presented here, demonstrated that this method was effective in suppressing the instability. Because this test rig did not exhibit a well pronounced instability, a question remained regarding {{the effectiveness of the}} control methodology when applied to a more coherent instability. To answer this question, a modified combustor rig was assembled at the NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio. The modified rig exhibited a more coherent, higher amplitude instability, but at a lower frequency of about 315 Hz. Test results show that this control method successfully reduced the instability pressure of the lower frequency test rig. In addition, due to a certain phenomena discovered and reported earlier, the so called Intra-Harmonic Coupling, a dramatic suppression of the instability was achieved by <b>focusing</b> <b>control</b> on the second harmonic of the instability. These results and their implications are discussed, as well as a hypothesis describing the mechanism of intra-harmonic coupling...|$|E
40|$|Spatial {{heterogeneity}} {{in environmental}} conditions may restrict {{the spread of}} invasive species to narrow corridors between extensive patches of suitable habitat; thus, {{we may be able}} to curtail invasions by identifying such corridors, and <b>focusing</b> <b>control</b> efforts in these areas. Invasive cane toads Rhinella marina have spread rapidly through northern Australia, but to invade further into Western Australia, the toads must traverse a narrow arid corridor where artificial waterbodies may serve as critical stepping stones for range expansion. We focus on the cane toads' imminent expansion into north-western Australia and use stochastic simulation to identify areas in which removal of artificial waterbodies would be most effective at stopping their spread. Our model predicts that toads will spread from the Kimberley to the Pilbara regions of Western Australia through a narrow coastal corridor, but that they will depend upon artificial waterbodies to do so. Importantly, excluding toads from artificial waterbodies is predicted to prevent toads from colonizing c. 268200 km 2 of their potential range in Western Australia. We identified three locations where closure of a relatively small subset of artificial waterbodies is predicted to halt the spread of toads. Synthesis and applications. We present a modelling framework that can be used to focus management activities within invasion corridors. Our analyses suggest that strategic removal of potential invasion hubs along such corridors can halt the spread of an invasive species...|$|E
40|$|Background: Interest in indoor {{residual}} spray (IRS) has been rekindled in recent years, {{as it is}} increasingly {{considered to be a}} key component of integrated malaria management. Regular spraying of each human dwelling becomes less and less practical as the control area increases. Where malaria transmission is concentrated around focal points, however, targeted IRS may pose a feasible alternative to mass spraying. Here, the impact of targeted IRS was assessed in the highlands of western Kenya. Methods: Indoor {{residual spray}} using lambda-cyhalothrin insecticide was carried out during the last week of April 2005 in 1, 100 targeted houses, located in the valley bottom areas of Iguhu village, Kakamega district of western Kenya. Although the uphill areas are more densely populated, valleys are believed to be malaria transmission hotspots.

40|$|Space Station Crew Health Care System {{procedures}} {{require the}} use of an on-board microscope whose slide images will be transmitted for analysis by ground-based microbiologists. Focusing of microscope slides is low on the list of crew priorities, so NASA is investigating the option of telerobotic focusing controlled by the microbiologist on the ground, using continuous video feedback. However, even at Space Station distances, the transmission time lag may disrupt the focusing process, severely limiting the number of slides that can be analyzed within a given bandwidth allocation. Substantial time could be saved if on-board automation could pre-focus each slide before transmission. The authors demonstrate the feasibility of on-board automatic focusing using a fuzzy logic ruled-based system to bring the slide image into focus. The original prototype system was produced in under two months and at low cost. Slide images are captured by a video camera, then digitized by gray-scale value. A software function calculates an index of 'sharpness' based on gray-scale contrasts. The fuzzy logic rule-based system uses feedback to set the microscope's <b>focusing</b> <b>control</b> in an attempt to maximize sharpness. The systems as currently implemented performs satisfactorily in focusing a variety of slide types at magnification levels ranging from 10 to 1000 x. Although feasibility has been demonstrated, the system's performance and usability could be improved substantially in four ways: by upgrading the quality and resolution of the video imaging system (including the use of full color); by empirically defining and calibrating the index of image sharpness; by letting the overall focusing strategy vary depending on user-specified parameters; and by fine-tuning the fuzzy rules, set definitions, and procedures used...|$|E

This study identifies the types of human-made or -used structures that are key sources of these bugs {{in the initial stages}} of house reinfestation after an insecticide spraying campaign. Methodology and Principal Findings We measured demographic and blood-feeding parameters at two geographic scales in 11 rural communities in Figueroa, northwest Argentina. Of 1, 297 sites searched in spring, 279 (21. 5 %) were infested. Bug abundance per site and female fecundity differed significantly among habitat types (ecotopes) and were highly aggregated. Domiciles (human sleeping quarters) had maximum infestation prevalence (38. 7 %), human-feeding bugs and total egg production, with submaximal values for other demographic and blood-feeding attributes. Taken collectively peridomestic sites were three times more often infested than domiciles. Chicken coops had greater bug abundance, blood-feeding rates, engorgement status, and female fecundity than pig and goat corrals. The host-feeding patterns were spatially structured yet there was strong evidence of active dispersal of late-stage bugs between ecotopes. Two flight indices predicted that female fliers were more likely to originate from kitchens and domiciles, rejecting our initial hypothesis that goat and pig corrals would dominate. Conclusions and Significance Chicken coops and domiciles were key source habitats fueling rapid house reinfestation. <b>Focusing</b> <b>control</b> efforts on ecotopes with human-fed bugs (domiciles, storerooms, goat corrals) would neither eliminate the substantial contributions to bug population growth from kitchens, chicken coops, and pig corrals nor stop dispersal of adult female bugs from kitchens.
