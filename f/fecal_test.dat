We evaluated {{the performance of a}} new one-step <b>fecal</b> <b>test</b> for H. pylori for diagnosis of H. pylori infection in Taiwan. MethodsWe developed a <b>fecal</b> <b>test</b> to detect H. pylori based on the immunochronomatographic assay and a mixture of monoclonal antibodies. We first recruited symptomatic patients from the primary care setting to evaluate <b>fecal</b> <b>test</b> performance using a reference standard consisting of 13 C urea breath test, rapid urease test, and histology. We also compared the performance of the <b>fecal</b> <b>test</b> with that of others. Next, we recruited asymptomatic participants from the mass screening setting to evaluate population attendance for the <b>fecal</b> <b>test</b> and compared its performance with that of 13 C urea breath test. ResultsIn the primary care setting, 117 patients were recruited; H. pylori infection was confirmed in 58 (49. 6 %). <b>Fecal</b> <b>test</b> sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy were 88. 0 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 79. 6 – 96. 4 %], 100 %, 100 %, 89. 4 % (95 % CI, 82. 0 – 96. 8 %), and 94 % (95 % CI, 89. 7 – 98. 3 %), respectively. <b>Fecal</b> <b>test</b> specificity and positive predictive value were significantly higher than those of the serological test, whereas the sensitivity and negative predictive value were lower than those of the 13 C urea breath test (p <  0. 05). In the mass screening setting, 2720 of 3520 invited individuals participated (77. 3 %; 95 % CI, 76 – 78. 7 %); 649 (23. 9 %) showed positive results. Concordance rate and kappa statistic between the <b>fecal</b> <b>test</b> and 13 C urea breath test were 91. 7 % (563 / 614; 95 % CI, 89. 9 – 94. 1 %) and 0. 78 (95 % CI, 0. 73 – 0. 84), respectively.

40|$|Johne's Disease (JD), {{caused by}} Mycobacterium avium {{subspecies}} paratuberculosis (MAP), results in significant economic loss to livestock production. The {{early detection of}} MAP infection in animals with extant serological assays has remained challenging due to the low sensitivity of commercially available ELISA tests, a fact that has hampered the development of effective JD control programs. Our recent protein microarray-based studies identified several promising candidate antigens that are immunogenic during different stages of MAP infection. To evaluate these antigens for use in diagnostic assays and reliably identify animals with MAP infection, a multiplex (Luminex®) assay was developed using color-coded flourescent beads coupled to 6 MAP recombinant proteins and applied to screen 180 serum and 90 milk samples from cows {{at different stages of}} MAP infection including negative (NL), <b>fecal</b> <b>test</b> positive/ELISA negative (F+E-), and fecal positive/ELISA positive (F+E+). The results show that while serum antibody reactivities to each of the 6 antigens were highest in F+E+ group, antibody reactivity to three of the six antigens were identified in the F+E- group, suggesting that these three antigens are expressed and provoke antibody responses during the early infection stages with MAP. Further, antibodies against all six antigens were elevated in milk samples from both the F+E- and F+E+ groups in comparison to the NL group (p< 0. 01). Taken together, the results of our investigation suggest that multiplex bead-based assays are able to reliably identify MAP infection, even during early stages when antibody responses in animals are undetectable with widely used commercial ELISA tests...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Real-time {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} (RT-PCR) is a widely used technique for bacterial and viral infection diagnosis. Herein, we report our preliminary experience in retrieving H. pylori genetic sequences in stools and analyzing genotypic clarithromycin resistance by RT-PCR (noninvasive), {{with the aim of}} comparing this procedure with that performed on biopsy samples (invasive). Materials and methods: After ‘in vitro’ demonstration of H. pylori DNA detection from pure and stool-mixed bacteria, 52 consecutive patients at the first diagnosis of infection were investigated. DNA was extracted from biopsy tissue and stool samples (THD® <b>Fecal</b> <b>Test,</b> Italy). RT-PCR was performed to detect 23 S rRNA encoding bacterial subunit gene and search A 2143 G, A 2142 C, A 2142 G point mutations for clarithromycin resistance assessment. Results: RT-PCR showed H. pylori positive DNA in all infected patients with full concordance between tissue and stool detection (100 %). We found A 2143 G mutation in 10 (19. 2 %), A 2142 G in 4 (7. 7 %) and A 2142 C in 5 (9. 6 %) patients; there was a full agreement between biopsy and fecal samples. A 2143 G was found in all the four A 2142 G positive cases and in three out of the five A 2142 C positive strains. Overall clarithromycin resistance rate in our series was 23 %. Conclusions: Despite the need of confirmation on large sample, stool RT-PCR analysis could represent a feasible tool to detect H. pylori DNA sequences and antibiotic resistance point mutations. As compared to tissue molecular analysis, this technique is noninvasive, with potential advantages such as improvement of patient compliance, reduction of diagnostic procedure time/cost and improvement of therapeutic outcome...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Screening {{programs}} for colorectal cancer (CRC) are mainly {{based on a}} first-line fecal immunochemical test for hemoglobin (FIT). Fecal M 2 -type pyruvate kinase (M 2 -PK) has been evaluated in clinical settings showing promising results for early CRC detection. However, the impact of fecal M 2 -PK assessment {{on the performance of}} first-round CRC screening programs is not known. We investigated whether fecal M 2 -PK alone or in combination with FIT may improve CRC screening efficacy in the general population. Materials and methods: A total of 1027 asymptomatic subjects (median age 66 [59 - 74] years; females 504 [49. 1 %]), identified through the general practitioners’ rosters, were invited for the collection of 2 fecal samples for FIT and M 2 -PK evaluation. Participants with at least positive one <b>fecal</b> <b>test</b> were referred for colonoscopy. Quality indicators for screening performance were calculated and analyzed using Fisher’s exact test. Results: Overall, 572 subjects underwent both FIT and M 2 -PK assessment (participation rate 55. 7 %) : 93 participants showed positive results for at least one test (positivity rate 16. 3 %). Only 10 patients were positive for both tests. Attendance rate to colonoscopy was 86. 0 % and a total of 65 adenomas and 7 cancers were detected. Combined use of FIT and fecal M 2 -PK permitted the identification of 18 more neoplasm (25 %) without improving colonoscopy workload, as deduced by the comparable number needed to scope (P = 0. 402). Conclusion: The addition of M 2 -PK testing to FIT offers the potential to detect additional neoplasms that either do not bleed or only bleed intermittently without reducing participation rate and without increasing endoscopy workload...|$|E

40|$|Colorectal cancer (CRC) is {{the third}} {{most common type of}} cancer {{diagnosed}} in Canada, and {{is the leading cause of}} cancer-related deaths in nonsmokers. Although CRC is considered to be 90 % curable if detected early, the majority of patients present with advanced stage III or IV disease. An effective screening test may significantly decrease disease burden. The present paper examines the rationale and potential of <b>fecal</b> DNA <b>testing</b> as an alternative and adjunct to other CRC screening tests. The most efficacious <b>fecal</b> DNA <b>test</b> developed to date has a sensitivity and specificity of 87. 5 % and 82 %, respectively. The approach has a higher positive predictive value than the currently used <b>fecal</b> occult blood <b>test</b> and offers a noninvasive option to patients. It is not reliant on the presence of bleeding, which may be intermittent or altogether absent. The test is now commercially available and is supported by a number of American insurers. Current challenges include cost reduction and demonstration of mortality benefit in a rigorous clinical trial. Despite current challenges, <b>fecal</b> DNA <b>testing</b> is worth pursuing. Both the American Gastroenterological Society and the American Cancer Society maintain that molecular testing is in its infancy but is promising. <b>Fecal</b> DNA <b>testing</b> has the potential to be an exciting addition to the current armament of CRC screening options...|$|R
