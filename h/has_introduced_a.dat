5|$|Kinky Boots adds to {{the public}} {{discourse}} of gender, and its flexibility and fluidity. The prevalence of drag culture in mainstream media <b>has</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>a</b> step of separation between femininity and “being female”. While the show preaches a message of acceptance, this separation of impersonation and identity can cause issues for the transgender community.|$|E
5|$|Poland <b>has</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>a</b> {{series of}} {{projectiles}} for Rheinmetall's tank gun, including an armor-piercing penetrator target practice round (APFSDS-T-TP), a high-explosive round, and a high-explosive target practice (HE-TP) projectile.

5|$|The three coves to {{the east}} of Helvellyn are all {{important}} sites for remnant populations of arctic-alpine plants. Species such as downy willow (Salix lapponum), mountain avens (Dryas octopetala), alpine mouse-ear (Cerastium alpinum), alpine meadowgrass (Poa alpina) and others have been able to survive in these coves since the last glaciation through a combination of rocks rich in basic minerals, a harsh micro-climate, and inaccessibility to grazing sheep on cliff ledges. However, these populations are small and are not reproducing well. Natural England <b>has</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>a</b> recovery plan for them.|$|E
5|$|While {{extremely}} severe {{commercial and}} recreational overfishing in the 1800s {{and the early}} 1900s caused the first strong declines of Murray cod, overfishing by recreational fishermen, aided by inadequate fishing regulations, continues today and remains an extremely serious threat to Murray cod. The current size limit of 60centimetres in most states is inadequate now that scientific studies have documented average size at sexual maturity in Murray cod. This and catch data and computer modelling exercises on wild Murray cod stocks indicate measures such as raising the size limit to 70centimetres and reducing the bag and possession limits from 2 and 4 fish respectively to 1 fish are urgently needed to maintain the long-term viability of wild Murray cod populations. As of November 2014, the NSW Department of Fisheries <b>has</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>a</b> maximum size limit of 75cm for Murray Cod to provide protection for large breeding fish, {{as well as a}} new minimum size limit of 55cm.|$|E

25|$|South Africa <b>has</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>a</b> {{policy of}} free basic services, {{including}} water, electricity and solid waste collection. As {{part of that}} policy, every household is to receive the first 6 cubic meters per month for free. The policy was introduced gradually since 2000 within the means of each municipality. Each municipality decides if free basic water is made available to everyone or only to the poor. Most municipalities provide free basic water to all or almost all their residents. In 2012 the program reached 86% of all households.|$|E
25|$|Invercargill {{is home to}} the Southern Institute of Technology, which <b>has</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>a</b> zero-fees scheme. The {{scheme was}} partly {{responsible}} for rejuvenating the city when it was in a steady state of population decline. However the major factor in Invercargill's regrowth is the dairy industrial boom of the 2000s (decade) due to an increased demand for New Zealand milk, cheese and butter. New dairy factories have opened around the Southland Region, as well as more efficient meat processing works and research and development facilities.|$|E

25|$|Colonia San Rafael is a colonia of the Cuauhtémoc {{borough of}} Mexico City, {{just west of}} the {{historic}} city center. It was established in the late 19th century {{as one of the first}} formal neighborhoods outside of the city center and initially catered to the wealthy of the Porfirio Díaz era. These early residents built large mansions, many with French influence, and many still remain. Middle class residents moved in soon afterwards, and building and rebuilding over the 20th century <b>has</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>a</b> number of architectural styles. These buildings include some of the first works by Luis Barragán and today 383 are classified as having historic value.|$|E
25|$|Wine expert Tom Stevenson {{describes}} the classic profile of Sancerre blanc as bone dry, highly aromatic with intense flavors of peaches and gooseberries. He describes Sancerre rouge as being light to medium bodied with floral aromas and delicate flavors. The Pinot noir based rosés {{are described as}} dry and light bodied with raspberry and strawberry notes. Other wine experts such as Jancis Robinson and Hugh Johnson note {{that in recent years}} overproduction <b>has</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>a</b> lot of variable quality with some Sancerre blancs producing flavor profiles that are not that much different from generic Sauvignon de Touraine from the Middle Loire, though this varies depending on the producer and overall quality of the vintage.|$|E
25|$|The {{spread of}} {{prostitution}} practices <b>has</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>a</b> large quantity of slang {{to the popular}} vocabulary. Prostitution is a popular subject in the media, especially on the internet. Typically news of police raids, court cases or family tragedies related to prostitution are published in a sensationalised form. A good example is news of an orgy between 400 Japanese clients and 500 Chinese prostitutes in 2003, which partially because of anti-Japanese sentiment, was widely publicised and met with considerable outrage. Another highly publicised case was that of Alex Ho Wai-to, then a Democratic Party candidate for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, who was given a six-month re-education through labor sentence for hiring a prostitute.|$|E
