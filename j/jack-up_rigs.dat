50|$|The company {{performs}} {{drilling activities}} throughout seven drilling rigs: GSP Atlas, GSP Prometeu, GSP Saturn, GSP Orizont, GSP Jupiter, GSP Fortuna and GSP Britannia. All GSP <b>jack-up</b> <b>rigs</b> are cantilever type.|$|E
40|$|Cantilever is {{the most}} {{important}} structure of the <b>jack-up</b> <b>rig.</b> <b>Jack-up</b> usually has three working conditions: drilling condition, storm condition, preloading condition. The fulcrums of the cantilever in the drilling condition are less than the other two. So the distribution of the cantilever force in the storm and preloading conditions becomes extremely complicated with the increase of fulcrums. In order to facilitate the evaluation of <b>jack-up</b> <b>rig</b> strength, a simplified analytical method and a finite element method (FEM) are presented to distribute the cantilever force on a <b>jack-up</b> <b>rig</b> during the storm and preloading conditions. For the simplified analytical method, the fulcrum force is obtained from the distance between the fulcrum and the position of the cantilever resultant force. For the FEM, the cantilever is assumed to be perfect rigid body without any strain. The fulcrum force is calculated according to the balance of the fulcrum forces. Both results of fulcrum force are analyzed and compared. It is shown that they are in good agreement. Thus both methods can be applied in distributing the cantilever force to evaluate the strength of <b>jack-up</b> <b>rig...</b>|$|R

40|$|The authors {{examine the}} {{production}} processes. The disadvantage of a <b>Jack-up</b> <b>rig</b> and method of its installation {{is the high}} constructive complexity of the devices supporting its float ability. This leads to large labour costs for installation and removal of <b>jack-up</b> floating drilling <b>rig.</b> A constraining factor {{in the development of}} projects on the shelf of the seas is the lack of technical means and technologies for the development of oil and gas fields, taking into account different climatic conditions, particularly in the Arctic seas...|$|R
50|$|In 2011, Ensco {{acquired}} Pride International for $7.3 billion. The acquisition provided Ensco {{access to}} the Brazil and West African markets, and diversified its asset base from being largely <b>jack-up</b> <b>rigs</b> to include drillship and semi-submersible rigs.

5000|$|Jack-Up Rigs- <b>Jack-up</b> <b>rigs</b> are mobile {{platforms}} {{that are}} used for more shallow or non-permanent oil deposits. This platform can be moved around, and the legs are then lowered to the sea floor and lock into place. The legs rise above the water, meaning the platform is raised {{up out of the}} water. That makes this type of rig safer to work on, because weather and waves are not an issue.|$|E

5000|$|The RPD limit {{should be}} clearly {{defined by the}} {{designer}} of the <b>jack-up</b> <b>rig,</b> and is subject to narrow design and as-built tolerances. The better the design tolerances are followed during construction, the lower the RPD will likely be during jacking operations, and the less wear the system will encounter. Excessive loading may result in failure of structural members in case the RPD reaches more than the allowable value.|$|R

50|$|An {{appraisal}} well Okoro -3 was spudded on 14 October 2006 by the Seadrill 7 <b>jack-up</b> <b>rig</b> on the Okoro Field. The well was drilled 1.5 km {{east of the}} Okoro-1 discovery well. Okoro-3 was the first well to be drilled by Afren/Amni on OML 112. The well was drilled as a vertical well and reached total depth of 6500 ft in the Miocene Agbada Formation. The well confirmed the eastern extension {{of the field and}} also the hydrocarbon contacts seen in both sand formations in the initial discovery. A full suite of modern log and pressure data was acquired and the well was successfully tested.|$|R
