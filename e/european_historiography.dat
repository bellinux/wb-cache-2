The representations of the Other (metaphoric, metonymic, anthropomorphic) are manifestations of the Western cultural attitudes inherent to the <b>European</b> <b>historiographies</b> of the non-European peoples labelled as [...] "the Other". Using analytical discourses (academic and commercial, geopolitical and military) the dominant ideology of the colonialist culture explains the Eastern world to the Western world, using the binary relationship of the European Self confronting the non-European Other from overseas.|$|R

The author deals with the very non-authentic modernisation in central Europe, which cannot yield pertinent and acceptable discernable results, but is very much able to block the actual development of intellectual disciplines. As a matter of fact, this blockade is occurring all the time, as sociologists and humanists replace new conceptions with an accumulation of poorly analysed and even more poorly interpreted data playing the role of material 2 ̆ 7 facts 2 ̆ 7. By means of several confrontations between procedures and explanations in the case of the object termed the Pre-March period (the periodleading to the revolution of March, 1848) the author demonstrates the absurdity of both the teleological conception of history and society as well as the resulting stereotypical interpretations...|$|R

The following study will offer a broad discussion on the sources as well as studies referring to early Ottoman history and the Battle of the Maritsa River. My intention is to bring attention to the great variety of versions that narrate the event. I will discuss how the authors constructed all these visions on the memorable event. By comparing Ottoman, Slavic, Greek and western sources I will discuss how these accounts came into being, the chronology they use, their imagination of the battlefield etc. In my discussion I will include written, oral and visual sources and show how they intermingle in the available accounts on the Battle in 1371. The Battle of Maritsa River has been referred to by South-East <b>European</b> <b>historiographies</b> as a fulcrum of history. That is why a discussion on the nationalisms in South-East Europe and Turkey cannot be avoided in this work.

5000|$|<b>European</b> <b>historiography</b> of Dahomey {{has been}} {{significant}} {{for its use}} in debates about the morality {{of the slave trade}} and for its importance to fields outside African history. Many of the early histories and descriptions were written by slave traders and the conclusions were that the slave trade was a process of freeing the population from the highly militarized, very brutal, and despotic Kingdom of Dahomey. William Snelgrave and Archibald Dalzel wrote key histories and memoirs of Dahomey presenting the case for the slave trade to save the population from human sacrifice. Abolitionist historians, in contrast, argued that the brutality of the Dahomey state {{was the result of the}} slave trade itself. [...] Dahomey was thus portrayed with a host of very negative stereotypes, with significant exaggeration, by European historians in the 18th and 19th century. [...] With increasing debates about the morality or immorality of the slave trade, Dahomey became a key aspect of the debate with significant attention.|$|E
50|$|The second trend brought real {{innovation}} to {{the study}} of history, introducing new techniques and research methodologies borrowed from the new <b>European</b> <b>historiography,</b> particularly the French Annales School.

They focused on topics that had been neglected before like economics and demographics. The vast majority of these new researchers studied at the Pedagogical Institute of the University of Chile.This new historiography movement put emphasis on the study of the long-running processes that had shaped the institutions, society and economy of Chile since colonial times. By the late 1960s, historians of this school had created links with the Marxist movement. The 1973 Chilean coup d'état put an abrupt end to this process and repressed the new social historiography, forcing these historians and researchers to flee the country. Many of them went to European universities to undertake postgraduate studies, which in the long term helped perfect their professional skills.|$|E

His first book, Vaincre Louis XIV (2010), about the emergence of the Anglo-Dutch alliance against Louis XIV, was awarded the Prix Guizot by the French Academy (2011). His second book, Un glaive pour un royaume (2014), tells the story of militia debates in Stuart England, explaining that the distinction between standing armies and militias has been exaggerated since the seventeenth century for reasons of political convenience.

5000|$|The {{process of}} refeudalization {{is also used}} in 17th century <b>European</b> <b>historiography.</b> The term was made famous by Italian Marxist historians Ruggiero Romano and Rosario Villari, to {{illuminate}} the social conditions behind the Neapolitan Revolt of 1647. The concept was influenced by Gramsci's ideas, the historigraphical debates during the 1950s and 1960s that centered on Eric Hobsbawm's seventeenth century [...] "General Crisis" [...] as well as 1960s Italian politics. Villari used it quite specifically {{in reference to the}} increasing pressure in the six decades preceding the revolt of 1647, in which the peasantry and the lower-middle classes revolted against the feudal aristocracy and international financiers. The process was triggered by the royal state's need for money. The Spanish crown ennobled the bourgeoisie of rich merchants and financiers, who infiltrated and reinforced the noble order. Fernand Braudel found the “clearest case of refeudalization” in Spanish Naples. The monarchy had raised capital by selling feudal titles, which in the long term increased the fiscal burden that the seigneurial regime imposed on the rural poor, since the nobles were exempted from paying taxes to the viceroyal regime. Refeudalization in a more general sense has been used to explain Italy's failed transition to modern capitalism. Though Italy had pioneered the commercial revolution, feudal barons neglected business opportunities to innovate and further rationalize the processes of production.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the status}} of science and {{technology}} under Muslim rulers, George Sarton viewed it as stifling of Hindu culture and patronage of learned men of Arabic and Persian. This is contradicted by Abdur Rahman on the basis of social, cultural and ethical factors which were an integral part of Asian scientific and technological thinking and the studies of history {{of science and technology}} in India portrayed by a distorted view with a [...] "European-centric" [...] vision. Early writings on this period were influenced by what happening in Europe at the time, and the view of seeing major scientific developments devoid of rationality or scientific developments due to medieval period in Europe also being seen as period of much decadence of knowledge. Poonam Bala quoting Percival Spear states that the élan of Muslim prosletysim had died away by the sixteenth century and apart from moments of passions of fanaticism, the tendency now was to live and let live. The Turkish enthusiasm of conquests and empire-building was wilted due to Timur's invasions. There was interaction between Hindu and Muslim ideas and well as sciences during the medieval period of Muslim rulers. The Muslim rulers had adopted Indian customs, cultural traditions, ethos, in addition to patronizing Indian music, painting and literature. [...] Some of the British Orientalists claimed that Indian sciences went into decline during the Muslim rule, a claim also used by proponents of Hindu nationalism and Hindu Indian identity. The period was characterized as a [...] "Dark Age" [...] until the British rule came to India. These claims were mainly due to the characterization of Middle Ages as Dark Ages in European periodization as well as the prejudice against Islam by Europeans and nineteent-century <b>European</b> <b>historiography.</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{proposes to}} compare, {{but also to}} connect, {{the rise of a}} new type of unlearned historical report, ›fast historiography‹, in Latin and vernacular in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Connections are suggested by combining the characteristics of such writing with book and library history as well with social history. New roles of book writing coincided with a larger social spread among authors as well as with a new library horizon – books now began to circulate at higher speed, in greater numbers and in less solemn circumstances. These possibilities were exploited and pushed forward both in Latin and vernacular historiography. This connection has been overlooked for several reasons, primarily because Latin and vernacular literatures are often considered each on their own terms, compartmentalized into two ›traditions‹ in which Latin seems to bear an automatic tag as learned and ecclesiastical. But {{this is not the case}} with Gesta Francorum, Galbert of Bruges, Raol (on the conquest of Lisbon), Caffaro, Henry of Livonia etc. – they all resemble the simple account in French of Robert de Clari and others. Related to this argument, the article opens with reflections on canons and paradigms of <b>European</b> medieval <b>historiography</b> (in papal Europe) and suggests that comparisons and connections always spring from certain strong national canons and that the questions they are devised to answer are to a large degree determined by such canonical series. Indirectly the article is therefore also an experiment with comparisons outside the dominant national canons and between non-canonical pieces...|$|R
