Several of his collaborators were also removed. Edward Gierek was drafted as the new first secretary.

5|$|During {{the events}} of Halo 2, the Covenant and humans {{discover}} a second ringworld, Installation 05, or Delta Halo. It was monitored by 2401 Penitent Tangent, who completely ignored Flood warnings and was captured by their leader, the Gravemind. The Covenant leadership wants to activate the installation, believing it {{is the key to}} their salvation. At the same time, the Flood, led by an intelligence known as the Gravemind, lay siege to the Covenant's city-ship, High Charity. After 343 Guilty Spark informs Halo's true purpose to the Arbiter, a Covenant holy warrior, of the <b>danger</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Halos truly represent, a group of humans and Covenant Elites prevent the firing of the ring. The unexpected shutdown activates a fail-safe protocol, priming the remaining Halo installations for remote activation from a location known as The Ark.|$|E
5|$|The Privy Council {{identified}} one of {{the extreme}} circumstances as that which occurred in Wright & Advertiser Newspapers Limited v. Lewis (1990). In this case, the Supreme Court of South Australia held that an action may proceed against a legislator accused of libel where the whole {{subject matter of the}} alleged libel relates to the legislator's conduct in the legislature so that the effect of parliamentary privilege is to exclude virtually all the evidence necessary to justify the libel. If such an action is not allowed to proceed, not only will there be injustice to the defendant, but there will also be a real <b>danger</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> media will be forced to abstain from the truthful disclosure of the legislator's misbehaviour in Parliament. This would be a most serious inroad into freedom of speech since justification would be impossible.|$|E

According to other sources, between 170 and 203 aircraft were constructed. The II series was the same aircraft with a different engine and Hungarian machine guns. The first aircraft received from Italy were sent to Debrecen to strengthen home defences, as there was <b>danger</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> growing crisis over Transylvania {{could lead to a}} conflict with Romania.

25|$|As for... {{the great}} {{question}} {{of the power of}} sovereigns and the obedience their peoples owe them, I usually say that {{it would be good for}} princes to be persuaded that their people have the right to resist them, and for the people, on the other hand, to be persuaded to obey them passively. I am, however, quite of the opinion of Grotius, that one ought to obey as a rule, the evil of revolution being greater beyond comparison than the evils causing it. Yet I recognize that a prince can go to such excess, and place the well-being of the state in such <b>danger,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> obligation to endure ceases. This is most rare, however, and the theologian who authorizes violence under this pretext should take care against excess; excess being infinitely more dangerous than deficiency.|$|E
25|$|General Ferdinand Foch {{ordered the}} left {{flank of the}} French armies to move northward to Arras, Lens and Lille, to {{recreate}} {{a threat to the}} German northern flank, by moving through Arras to Cambrai and Le Cateau and from Lens to Valenciennes and Maubeuge. If the French occupied the area between Cambrai, Valenciennes, Maubeuge and Le Cateau, the German forces on the upper Somme, Oise and the Aisne would lose the use of the two main railways to Liege, although this would not be decisive, since the line from Laon to Vervins, Hirson, Charleroi, Namur and Liege and that from Laon to Mézières and Montmédy to either Luxemburg and Treves or Thionville and Metz, would still be available to the Germans. French moves to the north were also influenced by events in the siege of Antwerp, where Termonde fell on 26 September and increased the <b>danger</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> city and the Belgian army would be lost. The new Tenth Army was ordered to concentrate around Arras and Lens.|$|E
25|$|The French were {{severely}} mauled by Saumarez's squadron, several French ships also running aground, but {{the wind}} prevented the British from {{taking advantage of the}} opportunity to closely engage them. Hannibal was under heavy fire from the anchored Formidable and an array of Spanish batteries and gunboats, and could not bring her guns to bear on them. The main and mizzen masts were shot away, and her casualties mounted, while attempts to pull the ship off the shoal failed. The British force had suffered considerable damage to sails, masts and rigging, and in the light breeze, Saumarez saw there was the <b>danger</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> remainder of his ships might run aground like the Hannibal. At 13:35 he ordered his squadron to withdraw to Gibraltar, leaving the damaged Hannibal behind. Ferris ordered the survivors of his crew below decks to escape the worst of the fire as the combined guns of the French and Spanish forces turned on the last remaining target. He held out until 14:00, when seeing that further resistance would be futile, he ordered the colours struck, and the Hannibals ensign came down.|$|E

500|$|The {{fighting}} {{ended in}} October 2006 when, in a controversial move, control was ceded to local tribal elders.

At the time, a British officer commented: [...] "There is an obvious <b>danger</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Taliban could make the deal and then renege on it." [...] The Taliban did renege on the agreement, quickly over-running the town with 200 to 300 troops in February 2007. The Taliban seizure followed a US airstrike that incensed militants; a Taliban commander's brother and 20 followers were killed in the attack. A confluence of tribal politics, religion, and money from the opium trade helped ensure the uneasy truce would not hold. At the time, the government claimed they could retake the town within 24 hours, but that plan had been postponed to avoid causing civilian casualties.|$|E
500|$|The Montreal Laboratory {{investigated}} multiple {{avenues of}} reactor development. One was a homogeneous reactor, {{in which a}} uranium compound was dissolved in heavy water to form a slurry, or a [...] "mayonnaise" [...] as the Montreal team called it. This offered various advantages for cooling, control {{and the ability to}} draw off plutonium that was produced. Paneth, Goldschmidt and others experimented with methods of preparing such a uranium compound, but none could be found with the required density. They considered using enriched uranium, but it was unavailable. Attention then turned to a heterogeneous reactor, in which a lattice of uranium metal rods were immersed in heavy water. While much less heavy water would be required, there was a <b>danger</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> water would decompose into deuterium and oxygen—a potentially explosive combination. There was great interest in breeder reactors, which could breed plutonium from uranium or uranium-233 from thorium, as it was believed that uranium was scarce. A process was devised for separating the uranium from thorium.|$|E
