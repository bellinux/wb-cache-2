40|$|Abstract—This paper {{extends the}} Sub-carrier Phase Combination {{technique}} previously {{presented by the}} authors {{to mitigate the effect}} of frequency selective Radio Frequency (RF) propagation <b>delay</b> <b>distortions</b> in Alternate Binary Offset Carrier (AltBOC) receivers. Two major propagation <b>delay</b> <b>distortion</b> sources are considered: the ionosphere and multipath. Initial analysis shows that the ionospheric delay errors can be reduced to being comparable to the receiver impairments (when the error due to multipath is low) and the maximum multipath error (under low ionospheric distortions) can be reduced to half a meter. Under extremely high ionospheric <b>delay</b> <b>distortions,</b> the multipath <b>delay</b> error <b>envelope,</b> with the proposed technique, will suffer no change in the magnitude of the error except that the spatial characteristics are different. The underlying idea of the proposed technique is that difference in the phase delays of the E 5 a and E 5 b signal tracking is simply the slope of the phase response over the entire band and hence represents the group delay at the E 5 center frequency of 1191. 795 MHz. The group delay which appears as the code phase error for the E 5 signal tracking, can thus be compensated except for the occurrence of higher order errors. I...|$|R

However, existing scheduling schemes for real-time video services in wireless networks generally do {{not take into account}} the relationship between the transmission <b>delay</b> and video <b>distortion.</b> In this paper, we develop and evaluate a delay-distortion-aware wireless video scheduling scheme in the framework of cross-layer information adaptation. At first, we construct a general video distortion model according to the observed wireless network parameters, as well as each video sequence's rate-distortion characteristic. Then, we exploit a distortion-aware wireless video scheduling scheme and derive a bound on the asymptotic decay rate of the video distortion. Furthermore, the relationship between the <b>delay</b> and <b>distortion</b> is studied by taking into account video application <b>delay</b> and <b>distortion</b> requirements for specific wireless network environments.

Obtaining sufficient linearity and spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) is a significant premise of guaranteeing sensing performance which, however, usually suffers from the nonlinear distortion coming from the broadband radio frequency (RF) front-end in the sensor node. Moreover, unlike other existing methods, the joint effect of non-constant group <b>delay</b> <b>distortion</b> and nonlinear distortion is discussed, and its corresponding solution is provided in this paper.
