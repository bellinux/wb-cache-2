40|$|Abstract. Hot-dip {{galvanized}} transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) {{steel sheets}} were recently developed for automotive applications. The microstructure and the adhesion of zinc coated CMnSi TRIP steel alloyed with P were studied. The α-Zn coating {{adjacent to the}} steel substrate consists of a continuous η-Fe 2 Al 5 -xZnx <b>inhibition</b> <b>layer</b> with columnar ζ-FeZn 13 intermetallic particles on top. Along the interface between the <b>inhibition</b> <b>layer</b> and the steel substrate Mn/Mn-P oxides were frequently observed. Although these oxides at the steel surface reduce the adhesion between the zinc coating and the TRIP steel, they do not cause any bare spots during galvanizing. Upon tensile deformation of the galvanized steel sheet, cracking along the α-zinc grain boundaries preceded fracture of the interface between the α-Zn layer and the <b>inhibition</b> <b>layer.</b> After 4 % deformation the average interface crack length increased linearly with the applied strain.

Excellent electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), such as Pt, can also cause other side-reactions, including the water-forming back-reaction from H 2 and O 2 products. A Cr-based amorphous layer coated on catalysts can work as a successful surface modifier that avoids the back-reaction, but its capabilities and limitations toward other species have not been studied. Herein, we investigated the Cr-based layer on Pt from perspectives of both electrocatalysis and photocatalysis using redox-active molecules/ions (O 2, ferricyanide, IO 3 –, S 2 O 82 –, H 2 O 2, and CO gas). Our systematic study revealed that utilization of the Cr-based layer realized an exclusive cathodic reaction only to HER, even {{in the presence of}} the aforementioned reactive species, suggesting that Cr-based layers work as membranes, as well as corrosion and poison <b>inhibition</b> <b>layers.</b> However, the Cr-based layer experienced self-oxidation and dissolved into the aqueous phase when a strong oxidizing agent or low pH was present.

The adhesion at various interfaces that exist in zinc-coated steel was quantitatively estimated using a so-called "macroscopic atom" model. In addition, the adhesion at the interfaces in zinc-coated steel was qualitatively assessed by examining the fracture and delamination behavior upon tensile testing.

40|$|In {{the modern}} {{galvanizing}} line, {{as soon as}} the steel strip enters the aluminum-containing zinc bath, two reactions occur at the strip and the liquid-zinc alloy interface: (1) iron rapidly dissolves from the strip surface, raising the iron concentration in the liquid phase at the strip-liquid interface; and (2) aluminum forms a stable aluminum-iron intermetallic compound layer at the strip-coating interface due to its greater affinity toward iron. The main objective {{of this study is to}} develop a simple and realistic mathematical model for better understanding of the kinetics of galvanizing reactions at the strip and the liquid-zinc alloy interface. In the present study, a model is proposed to simulate the effect of various process parameters on iron dissolution in the bath, as well as, aluminum-rich <b>inhibition</b> <b>layer</b> formation at the substrate-coating interface. The transient-temperature profile of the immersed strip is predicted based on conductive and convective heat-transfer mechanisms. The inhibition-layer thickness at the substrate-coating interface is predicted by assuming the cooling path of the immersed strip consists of a series of isothermal holds of infinitesimal time-step. The influence of galvanizing reaction is assessed by considering nucleation and growth mechanisms at each hold time, which is used to estimate the total effect of the immersion time on the formation mechanism of the <b>inhibition</b> <b>layer.</b> The iron- dissolution model is developed based on well established principles of diffusion taking into consideration the area fraction covered by the intermetallic on the strip surface during formation of the <b>inhibition</b> <b>layer.</b> The model can be effectively used to monitor the dross formation in the bath by optimizing the process parameters.

The results indicates that the phase composition of the Zn- 0. 20 wt % Al-Mg ternary phase diagram near the Al-low corner is the same as Zn-Mg binary phase diagram, suggesting Al in the Zn-Mg (ZM) coatings mainly concentrates on the interfacial layer between the coating and steel substrate. The microstructure of continuously hot-dip galvanizing ZM coatings with 0. 20 wt % Al containing 1. 0 – 3. 0 wt % Mg was investigated using tunneling electron microscopy (TEM). The morphology of Zn in the coating changes from bulk to strip and finally to mesh-like, and the MgZn 2 changes from rod-like to mesh-like with the Mg content increasing.

40|$|The `Neural Pipeline' is {{introduced}} as an {{artificial neural network}} architecture that controls information flow using its own connection structure. The architecture is multi-layered with `external' connections between the layers to control the data. Excitatory connections transfer data from each layer to the next and inhibitory feedback connections run from each layer to the previous layer. Using these connections a layer can temporarily silence the previous layer and stop further inputs until it finishes processing. When excitation and inhibition are balanced, waves of activity propagate sequentially through the layers after each input; this is `correct' behaviour. When the system is `over' inhibited, the inhibitory feedback outweighs the excitation from the input. At least one layer remains inhibited for too long so further inputs cannot stimulate the <b>layer.</b> Over <b>inhibition</b> can be corrected by increasing the delay between inputs. When the system is `under' inhibited the excitation in the layer {{is larger than the}} <b>inhibition.</b> The <b>layer</b> is therefore not silenced and continues to spike. In the layers, excitatory and inhibitory spiking neurons are randomly inter-connected. Changing layer parameters influences the system behaviour. Recommendations for correct behaviour include: low neuron connectivity and balancing the external <b>inhibition</b> and <b>layer</b> activity. With variations of only the internal topology and weights, all three behaviours can be exhibited. Each layer is trained as a separate Liquid State Machine, with readout neurons trained to respond to a particular input. A set of six shapes can be learnt by all layers of a three layer Neural Pipeline. The layers are trained to recognise different features; layer 1 recognising the position while layer 2 identifies the shape. The system can cope when the same noisy signal is applied to all inputs, but begins to make mistakes when different noise is applied to each input neuron.

We report that subplate neurons are needed both for maturation of inhibition {{and for the}} proper sign of ocular dominance (OD) plasticity. Removal of subplate neurons prevents the developmental upregulation of genes involved in mature, fast GABAergic transmission in cortical layer 4, including GABA receptor subunits and KCC 2, and thus prevents the switch to a hyperpolarizing effect of GABA. To understand {{the implications of these}} changes, a realistic circuit model was formulated. Simulations predicted that without subplate neurons, monocular deprivation (MD) paradoxically favors LGN axons representing the deprived (less active) eye, exactly what was then observed experimentally. Simulations also account for published results showing that OD plasticity requires mature inhibition. Thus, subplate neurons regulate molecular machinery required to establish an adult balance of excitation and <b>inhibition</b> in <b>layer</b> 4, and thereby influence the outcome of OD plasticity...|$|R

Behaviorally relevant stimuli strengthen and expand within cortical sensory maps, while irrelevant or unused stimuli weaken and shrink.

This weakening reflected reduced excitatory synaptic input to FS interneurons, partially offset by increased strength of unitary FS to pyramidal cell synapses.

40|$|SummaryA {{canonical}} feedforward circuit {{is proposed}} to underlie sensory cortical responses with balanced excitation and <b>inhibition</b> in <b>layer</b> 4 (L 4). However, in another input layer, L 6, sensory responses {{and the underlying}} synaptic circuits remain largely unclear. Here, cell-attached recordings in rat primary auditory cortex revealed that {{for the majority of}} L 6 excitatory neurons, tonal stimuli did not drive spike responses, but suppressed spontaneous firings. Whole-cell recordings further revealed that the silencing resulted from tone-evoked strong inhibition arriving earlier than excitation. This pattern of inputs can be attributed to a parallel feedforward circuit with both excitatory and inhibitory inputs disynaptically relayed. In contrast, in the other neurons directly driven by thalamic input, stimuli evoked excitation preceding relatively weak inhibition, resulting in robust spike responses. Thus, the dichotomy of L 6 response properties arises from two distinct patterns of excitatory-inhibitory interplay.

Based on the dynamical and geometrical properties at cloud base, a new computation of the triggering is first proposed. The analysis of the distribution law of the maximum size of the thermals suggests that, in addition to this necessary condition, another triggering condition is required, that is, that this maximum horizontal size should exceed a certain threshold. This is explicitly represented stochastically. Therefore, the new formulation integrates the whole transition process from the first cloud to the first deep convective cell and can be decomposed into three steps: (i) the appearance of clouds, (ii) crossing of the <b>inhibition</b> <b>layer,</b> and (iii) deep convection triggering...|$|E

Different filler particle types complicate OIL formation for similar BisGMA/TEGDMA comonomer mixtures. The OIL had a detrimental effect on stain resistance, where an increased OIL thickness resulted in increased stain susceptibility. From the present findings it was suggested that incremental bond strength between composite layers is not wholly reliant on surface inhibition...|$|E
40|$|A novel, local {{inhibitory}} circuit {{in layer}} 2 / 3 of rat somatosensory cortex is described that connects pyramidal cells reciprocally with GABAergic vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-immunoreactive bipolar interneurons. In paired whole-cell recordings, the glutamatergic unitary responses (EPSPs or EPSCs) in bipolar cells evoked by repetitive (10 Hz) stimulation of a pyramidal cell show strong frequency-dependent depression. Unitary IPSPs evoked in pyramidal cells by repetitive stimulation of bipolar cells, on average, maintained their amplitude. This {{suggests that the}} excitatory synapses on bipolar cells act as a low-pass filter in the reciprocal pyramid-to-bipolar circuit. The EPSCs in bipolar cells are mediated predominantly by AMPA receptor (AMPAR) channels. AMPARs desensitize rapidly and recover slowly from desensitization evoked by a brief pulse of glutamate. In slices, reduction of AMPAR desensitization by cyclothiazide (50 - 100 ?M) or conditioning steady-state desensitization induced by application of extracellular AMPA (50 nM) or glutamate (50 ?M) strongly reduced synaptic depression. It is concluded that in the local circuits between pyramidal and bipolar cells the desensitization of AMPARs in bipolar cells contributes to low-pass feedback <b>inhibition</b> of <b>layer</b> 2 / 3 pyramidal neurons by bipolar cells...|$|R
40|$|Visual stimuli {{of short}} {{duration}} seem to persist longer after the stimulus offset than stimuli of longer duration. This visual persistence {{must have a}} physiological explanation. In ferrets exposed to stimuli of different durations we measured the relative changes in the membrane potentials with a voltage sensitive dye and the action potentials of populations of neurons in the upper layers of areas 17 and 18. For durations less than 100 ms, the timing and amplitude of the firing and membrane potentials showed several non-linear effects. The ON response became truncated, the OFF response progressively reduced, and {{the timing of the}} OFF responses progressively delayed the shorter the stimulus duration. The offset of the stimulus elicited a sudden and strong negativity in the time derivative of the dye signal. All these non-linearities could be explained by the stimulus offset inducing a sudden <b>inhibition</b> in <b>layers</b> II-III as indicated by the strongly negative time derivative of the dye signal. Despite the non-linear behavior of the layer II-III neurons the sum of the action potentials, integrated from the peak of the ON response to the peak of the OFF response, was almost linearly related to the stimulus duration...|$|R
40|$|Sensory information, relayed {{through the}} thalamus, {{arrives in the}} neocortex as {{excitatory}} input, but rapidly induces strong disynaptic inhibition that constrains the cortical flow of excita-tion both spatially and temporally. This feedforward inhibition is generated by intracortical interneurons whose precise identity and properties were not known. To characterize interneurons generating feedforward <b>inhibition,</b> neurons in <b>layers</b> IV and V of mouse somatosensory (“barrel”) cortex in vitro were tested in the cell-attached configuration for thalamocortically induced firing and in the whole-cell mode for synaptic responses. Iden-tification as inhibitory or excitatory neurons was based on intrinsic firing patterns and on morphology revealed by intra-cellular staining. Thalamocortical stimulation evoked action po-tentials in; 60 % of inhibitory interneurons but in, 5 % of excitatory neurons. The inhibitory interneurons that fired re...|$|R
