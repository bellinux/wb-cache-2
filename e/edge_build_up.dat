The coordination numbers of the alkaline earth cations to nearby O atoms range from seven (2 ×) to eight, and the TeIV atoms are surrounded by three oxygen partners {{in the form of}} trigonal pyramids. The SrOx polyhedra share corners and <b>edges</b> to <b>build</b> <b>up</b> a three-dimensional framework structure encapsulating channels propagating along [010]. The TeIV atoms flank the framework O atoms and are situated at the outer array of the channels with the 5 s 2 lone electron pairs protruding into the empty space of the channels (diameter ≃ 4  Å).

40|$|Let G = (V, E) be a graph {{modelling}} {{a building}} or road network in which edges have-both travel times (lengths) and capacities associated with them. An edges capacity {{is the number}} of people that can enter that edge in a unit of time. In emergencies, people evacuate towards the exits. If too many people try to evacuate through the same <b>edge,</b> congestion <b>builds</b> <b>up</b> and slows down the evacuation. Graphs with both lengths and capacities are known as Dynamic Flow networks. An evacuation plan for G consists of a choice of exit locations and a partition of the people at the vertices into groups, with each group evacuating to the same exit. The evacuation time of a plan is the time it takes until the last person evacuates. The k-sink evacuation problem is to provide an evacuation plan with k exit locations that minimizes the evacuation time. It is known that this problem is NP-Hard for general graphs but no polynomial time algorithm was previously known even for the case of G a tree. This paper presents an O(nk^ 2 log^ 5 n) algorithm for the k-sink evacuation problem on trees, which can also be applied to a more general class of problems...|$|R
40|$|Differences in {{the carbon}} {{behavior}} between He and D plasmas during VH-mode, L-mode and L-mode with excess gas puffing are reported and inferences {{on the importance}} of the various carbon sources during these modes of operation are discussed. During a VH-mode phase, VUV and visible charge exchange spectroscopy indicates that for both He and D operation the carbon behavior is very similar. In the <b>edge</b> plasma, carbon <b>build</b> <b>up</b> is quite rapid, and the carbon influx represents a large fraction of the total plasma density increase until the termination of the VH phase. During cold divertor operation induced by puffing the primary fueling gas, D and He discharges show a difference in the carbon behavior. The core carbon density is seen to be approximately constant during a D discharge as it transitions from an attached to a cold divertor. However in a He discharge, the core carbon density disappears soon after the cold divertor transition. Arguments are made that the primary carbon source in the ELM free H-mode period is physical sputtering by ion impact at the divertor strike point. In L-mode, both attached and cold divertor, the primary source is from the divertor region and two possibilities for this source are chemical sputtering or charge neutral sputtering. Existing data supports charge exchange neutrals as dominant...|$|R

It crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P 2 /c with the lattice parameters a = 921. 69 (5), b = 552. 71 (3), c = 1664. 37 (9) pm, β = 90. 218 (4) ° and Z = 2. The crystal structure of Na 2 Lu 3 I 3 [TeO 3] 4 exhibits two crystallographically different Lu 3 + cations, both coordinated by eight O 2 - anions as square antiprisms. These polyhedra are interconnected via four common <b>edges</b> to <b>build</b> <b>up</b> 5 -} layers (e = edge-linking) parallel to (100). Furthermore, the crystal structure includes a crystallographically unique Na+ cation surrounded by four O 2 - and four I- anions also {{in the shape of}} a square antiprism. These polyhedra connect via common (I 2) -***(I 2) - edges in generating 18 -} double-strands that are further linked by (I 1) - vertices to result in the formation of 17 -} layers (v = vertex-linking) spreading out parallel to (100) as well. Thus, the crystal structure contains two crystallographically distinct I- anions, of which (I 1) - is coordinated nearly linear (∢(Na-I 1 -Na) = 179. 6 °) by two Na+ cations, whereas (I 2) - has contact to three of them displaying a distance of 114 pm from the triangular (Na+) 3 plane. The crystal structure of Na 2 Lu 3 I 3 [TeO 3] 4 is completed by two crystallographically independent Te 4 + cations that show stereochemically active non-bonding electron pairs ("lone pairs") and are located above and below the 5 -} layers forming isolated ψ 1 -tetrahedral [TeO 3] 2 - anions (d(Te-O) = 188 - 190 pm) with all oxygen atoms...|$|R

40|$|We have {{explored}} the manifold physical scenario {{emerging from a}} model of Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) via thermal mixing under the hypothesis of highly effective electron-electron interaction. When the electron and nuclear reservoirs are also assumed to be in strong thermal contact and the microwave irradiation saturates the target electron transition, the enhancement of the nuclear polarization {{is expected to be}} considerably high even if the irradiation frequency is set far away from the centre of the ESR line (as already observed by Borghini) and the typical polarization time is reduced on moving towards the boundaries of said line. More reasonable behaviours are obtained by reducing the level of microwave saturation or the contact between electrons and nuclei in presence of nuclear leakage. In both cases the function describing the dependency of the steady state nuclear polarization on the frequency of irradiation becomes sharper at the <b>edges</b> and the <b>build</b> <b>up</b> rate decreases on moving off-resonance. If qualitatively similar in terms of the effects produced on nuclear polarization, the degree of microwave saturation and of electron-nucleus contact has a totally different impact on electron polarization, which is of course strongly correlated to the effectiveness of saturation and almost insensitive, at the steady state, to the magnitude of the interactions between the two spin reservoirs. The likelihood of the different scenario is discussed {{in the light of the}} experimental data currently available in literature, to point out which aspects are suitably accounted and which are not by the declinations of thermal mixing DNP considered here.
