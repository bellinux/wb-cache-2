5|$|On 2 May, the Battle in Berlin {{ended when}} General der Artillerie Helmuth Weidling, the {{commander}} of the Berlin <b>Defence</b> <b>Area,</b> unconditionally surrendered the city to General Vasily Chuikov, {{the commander of}} the Soviet 8th Guards Army.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet {{offensive}} into central Germany, what {{later became}} East Germany, had two objectives. Stalin {{did not believe}} the Western Allies would hand over territory occupied by them in the post-war Soviet zone, so he began the offensive on a broad front and moved rapidly to meet the Western Allies as far west as possible. But the overriding objective was to capture Berlin. The two goals were complementary because possession of the zone could not be won quickly unless Berlin were taken. Another consideration was that Berlin itself held useful post-war strategic assets, including Adolf Hitler and the German atomic bomb programme. On 6 March, Hitler appointed Lieutenant General Helmuth Reymann commander of the Berlin <b>Defence</b> <b>Area,</b> replacing Lieutenant General Bruno Ritter von Hauenschild.|$|E
5|$|On 23 April 1945, the Soviet 1st Belorussian Front and 1st Ukrainian Front {{continued}} {{to tighten the}} encirclement, severing the last link between the German IX Army and the city. Elements of the 1st Ukrainian Front {{continued to}} move westward and started to engage the German XII Army moving towards Berlin. On this same day, Hitler appointed General Helmuth Weidling as {{the commander of the}} Berlin <b>Defence</b> <b>Area,</b> replacing Lieutenant General Reymann. Meanwhile, by 24 April 1945 elements of 1st Belorussian Front and 1st Ukrainian Front had completed the encirclement of the city. Within the next day, 25 April 1945, the Soviet investment of Berlin was consolidated, with leading Soviet units probing and penetrating the S-Bahn defensive ring. By the end of the day, {{it was clear that the}} German defence of the city could not do anything but temporarily delay the capture of the city by the Soviets, since the decisive stages of the battle had already been fought and lost by the Germans outside the city. By that time, Schörner's offensive, initially successful, had mostly been thwarted, although he did manage to inflict significant casualties on the opposing Polish and Soviet units, slowing down their progress.|$|E

Concrete bunkers and casemates {{as well as}} open positions.|$|E
25|$|Anti-Aircraft Command's {{searchlights}} {{had been}} deployed in clusters, but in September 1941 this arrangement was changed and 89th S/L Rgt's lights were redeployed singly {{to form a}} 'killer belt' to assist Royal Air Force night-fighters. However, in October 1941, 89th S/L Rgt was ordered to redeploy again to provide closely spaced S/L cover within the Plymouth Gun <b>Defence</b> <b>Area</b> (GDA), with RHQ moving to Buckland Filleigh.|$|E
25|$|On 23 April 1945, {{the first}} Soviet ground forces started to {{penetrate}} the outer suburbs of Berlin. By 27 April, Berlin was completely {{cut off from the}} outside world. The battle in the city continued until 2 May 1945. On that date, the commander of the Berlin <b>Defence</b> <b>Area,</b> General Helmuth Weidling, surrendered to the commander of the Soviet 8th Guards Army, Lieutenant-General Vasily Chuikov. Chuikov was a constituent of Marshal Georgiy Zhukov's 1st Belorussian Front.|$|E

25|$|The Blitz {{ended in}} May 1941, {{and in the}} summer the {{regiment}} moved to South Wales, where it joined 61 AA Bde in 9 AA Division. Two sections of 154 HAA Bty were detached under command of 79 (Hertfordshire Yeomanry) HAA Rgt in the Swansea Gun <b>Defence</b> <b>Area.</b> These manned four 3.7-inch mobile guns at Port Talbot (August) and later at Briton Ferry (December). In January 1942, 52 HAA Rgt transferred to 5 AA Bde, still in 9 AA Division.|$|E
25|$|Although Hitler had {{appointed}} General Helmuth Weidling {{as defense}} commandant of Berlin, Mohnke remained free of Weidling's command {{to maintain his}} defense objectives of the Reich Chancellery and the Führerbunker. The combined total (for the city's defense) of Mohnke's SS Kampfgruppe, General Weidling's LVI Panzer Corps (and the other few units) totaled roughly 45,000 soldiers and 40,000 Volkssturm. They faced a superior number of Soviet Red Army soldiers. There were approximately 1.5 million Soviet troops allocated for the investment and assault on the Berlin <b>Defence</b> <b>Area.</b>|$|E
25|$|In August the {{regiment}} sent {{a cadre of}} experienced officers to 206th HAA Training Regiment at Arborfield where they formed a new 469 (Mixed) HAA Bty composed largely of women members of the Auxiliary Territorial Service. The following month the newly formed (all male) 439 Bty joined 113th HAA Rgt, replacing 359 Bty, which transferred to 60th (City of London) HAA Rgt, and later became an independent battery in the Falkland Islands garrison. The Derby–Nottingham Gun <b>Defence</b> <b>Area</b> (GDA) saw a renewal of occasional night attacks in the autumn, with all {{the regiment}}'s sites engaged on 22 October.|$|E

50|$|Luckily, {{the months}} of the Phoney War that {{followed}} mobilisation allowed AA Command to address its equipment shortages. Gun <b>Defence</b> <b>Areas</b> (GDAs) with 3-inch or 3.7-inch HAA guns were established around Leeds, Teesside (including Middlesbrough and Billingham) and Tyneside (including Newcastle). Vital Points (VPs) such as RAF Fighter Command airfields and factories began to receive a few Bofors guns.|$|R
50|$|Today, the FAF is {{organized}} into three Air Commands, each {{assigned to one}} of the three air <b>defence</b> <b>areas</b> into which Finland is divided. The main Wing bases are at Rovaniemi, Tampere and Kuopio-Rissala, each with a front-line squadron. Pilot training is undertaken at the Air Force Academy in Tikkakoski, with advanced conversion performed at squadron level.|$|R
25|$|A double row of {{anti-tank}} blocks {{divides the}} beach near Abbotsbury, where the Fleet Lagoon begins. Most of the seaward blocks have been destroyed, but the parallel lines of blocks on the landward side still survive in good condition. Within {{the same spot}} are two remaining Type 26 pillboxes, which were originally of four pillboxes associated with the blocks. The pillboxes were constructed in 1940 and were situated within the Abbotsbury <b>Defence</b> <b>area,</b> which at this time, was manned by the 6th Battalion Durham Light Infantry. Both structures remain half buried in the beach and tilted at an angle. An anti-tank ditch was located within this area, behind Chesil Beach.|$|E
25|$|With {{the decisive}} {{stages of the}} battle being fought outside the city, Berlin's fate was sealed, yet the {{resistance}} inside continued. On 23 April, Hitler appointed German Artillery General (General der Artillerie) Helmuth Weidling commander of the Berlin <b>Defence</b> <b>Area.</b> Only a day earlier, Hitler had ordered that Weidling be executed by firing squad. This was due to a misunderstanding concerning a retreat order issued by Weidling as commander of the LVI Panzer Corps. On 20 April, Weidling had been appointed commander of the LVI Panzer Corps. Weidling replaced Lieutenant-Colonel (Oberstleutnant) Ernst Kaether as commander of Berlin. Only one day earlier, Kaether had replaced Lieutenant-General (Generalleutnant) Helmuth Reymann, who had held the position for only about a month.|$|E
25|$|The headlong advance {{ended with}} the failure of Operation Market Garden at Arnhem, and {{emphasis}} shifted to bringing the port of Antwerp into use as a supply base. The planners envisaged a large Gun <b>Defence</b> <b>Area</b> (GDA) to deal not only with conventional air raids but also the threat of V-1 flying bombs (codenamed 'Divers'). At the beginning of October, 80th AA Bde began to equip its HAA units with Radar No 3 Mark V (the SCR-584 radar set) and No 10 Predictors (the all-electric Bell Labs AAA Computer), and began training operators on them in preparation for tracking these small fast-moving targets. Meanwhile, 114th LAA Rgt was re-equipped with the HAA's Vickers No 1 Predictor.|$|E
40|$|In cats anaesthetized with Althesin, the efferent {{descending}} pathway {{from the}} brain-stem <b>defence</b> <b>areas</b> has been traced through the medulla by identifying sites at which electrical stimulation evoked the characteristic {{pattern of the}} visceral alerting (defence) response. This response includes an increase in arterial blood pressure resulting from increased heart rate and cardiac output and vasoconstriction in renal and splanchnic beds, accompanied by active vasodilation in skeletal muscle. The efferent pathway runs as a narrow strip, about 3 mm from the mid line, ventral to the superior olive and {{the nucleus of the}} trapezoid body, extending caudally to the rostral portion of the inferior olive where it lies ventral to the facial nucleus. It was found to lie very close to the ventral medullary surface just rostral to and within the area at which bilateral topical application of glycine results in a profound fall in arterial blood pressure and cessation of respiration. On bilateral application of glycine to the sensitive area of the ventral medulla, the visceral alerting response evoked by stimulation in the <b>defence</b> <b>areas</b> of the amygdalo-hypothalamic complex, or the mid-brain central grey or tegmentum, was attenuated in parallel with the fall in arterial pressure, the vasoconstrictor responses being most strongly reduced. As soon as arterial blood pressure had fallen to its lowest level the visceral alerting response was virtually abolished. A small radio-frequency lesion made in the ventral medullary efferent pathway, in the rostral part of the 'glycine-sensitive area', had the same effect as that produced by unilateral application of glycine: it resulted in little respiratory or cardiovascular effect itself, but application of glycine to the contralateral area then produced the full effect otherwise seen only on bilateral application of glycine. It is suggested (1) that the effects of glycine result from blockade of a synaptic relay, close to the ventral surface of the medulla, in the efferent pathway from the <b>defence</b> <b>areas</b> to the preganglionic sympathetic neurones, and (2) that the neurones which receive an input from the alerting (<b>defence)</b> <b>areas</b> normally provide an essential, tonic excitatory drive to the sympathetic output and probably to respiration also. After sudden withdrawal of this drive, vasomotor tone and the normal level of arterial blood pressure are not maintained...|$|R

25|$|To {{counter air}} raids on London during World War I, E. B. Ashmore {{constructed}} a system {{known as the}} London Air <b>Defence</b> <b>Area</b> (LADA). Ashmore put defensive weapons into three rings around the city, searchlights and anti-aircraft artillery in the outer ring, fighter aircraft in the middle ring, and the innermost ring in the city contained more anti-aircraft guns. Ashmore set up a large plotting table at Horse Guards in London. Information from spotters was relayed to this central room where wooden blocks were placed on a large map to indicate the location of aircraft and other information. Observers around the map could relay this information to one of 25 regional control rooms, who re-created the portions of the map relevant to them and passed {{the information to the}} various weapons in their region.|$|E
25|$|In August 1942, Petrakovsky became {{commander}} of an operational {{group of the}} North Caucasian Front. In September, he became deputy {{commander of}} the 47th Army. In November, he became commander of the Tuapse <b>Defence</b> <b>Area.</b> During the fall of 1942, Petrakovsky's command helped block the road through the Pyatigorsk Pass. In February 1943, he became the deputy commander of 18th Army and fought in the Krasnodar Offensive. Between June and July, he led the 317th Rifle Division and participated in fighting on the Taman Peninsula. In August 1943, Petrakovsky was appointed commander of the 57th Rifle Corps and fought in the Battle of the Dnieper and the Lower Dnieper Offensive. On 18 January 1944, he was relieved of command due to illness {{and sent to the}} hospital. On 19 January, he was awarded the Order of Suvorov 2nd class. After recovery in March, Petrakovsky was put in reserve. In May 1944, he was sent to study at the Military Academy of the General Staff. After graduating in June 1945, he became 16th Army deputy commander. Petrakovsky participated in the Invasion of South Sakhalin in August 1945. On 27 August 1945, he was awarded the Order of Kutuzov 2nd class for his leadership during the invasion.|$|E
25|$|Krukenberg {{and many}} of the {{survivors}} of the remnants of the Nordland Division crossed the Spree shortly before dawn but could not break through and were forced back into the centre. There they split up, some discarded their uniforms and tried to pass themselves off as civilians, but most were either killed or, like Krukenberg, captured. An attempt to break out northward along the Schönhauser Allee by German troops on the north-eastern side of the central <b>defence</b> <b>area</b> failed because the Soviets were now aware that breakout attempts were being made and were hurriedly putting cordons in place to stop them. The remnants of the Münchenberg Division (five tanks, four artillery pieces, and a handful of troops) and the remnants of the 18th Panzer Grenadier and 9th Parachute divisions broke out of the centre westward through the Tiergarten. They were followed by thousands of stragglers and civilians. Spandau was still {{in the hands of a}} Hitler Youth detachment, so an attempt was made to force a passage across the Charlottenbrücke (Charlotten bridge) over the Havel. Despite heavy shelling which killed many, German weight of numbers meant that they were able to drive the Soviet infantry back and many thousands crossed into Spandau. The armoured vehicles that crossed the bridge made for Staaken.|$|E
25|$|Concurrently, Birt {{served as}} an advisor at McKinsey & Company's Global Media Practice from 2000-2005.

500|$|Henry Tizard, whose {{committee}} spearheaded {{development of}} the CH system, grew concerned that CH would be too effective.

Their predecessors in World War I did the same when the London Air <b>Defence</b> <b>Area</b> successfully blocked daytime raids, and attempts to intercept German bombers at night proved comically ineffective. Tizard's concerns would prove prophetic; Bowen called it [...] "one of the best examples of technological forecasting made in the twentieth century".|$|E
500|$|This opinion led to {{the thought}} of finding a good rear <b>defence</b> <b>area</b> where the Estates and the Swedish {{government}} could move if the capital was in danger. This in turn naturally strengthened the central defence theory. The core land (...) would be the place from where {{the main part of}} the field army would conduct its operations, supported by a few fortresses. The area between the two large lakes of Vänern and Vättern was the choice for this core land, with approximately the same border as Skaraborg County. Sweden above the province of Dalarna was not even considered to be included in this strategy. The realisation of the middle Sweden central defence system was finally made 5 February 1819 when King Charles XIV John decided that one main fortress, the central fortress, and two smaller [...] "operational fortresses" [...] were to be built. The central fortress became Karlsborg Fortress at Karlsborg, while the two operational fortresses meant to be located at either end of Vättern never were built due to lack of funds.|$|E
500|$|Throughout 1917 Germany {{began to}} deploy {{increasing}} numbers of fixed-wing bombers, the Gotha G.IV's first target being Folkestone on [...] 1917, following this attack the number of airship raids decreased rapidly in favour of raids by fixed wing aircraft, before Zeppelin raids were called off entirely. In total, Zeppelins dropped 6,000 bombs, resulting in 556 dead and 1,357 wounded. Soon after the raid on Folkestone, the bombers began raids on London: one daylight raid on [...] 1917 by 14 Gothas caused 162 deaths in the East End of London. In response to this new threat, Major General Edward Bailey Ashmore, a RFC pilot who later commanded an artillery division in Belgium, was appointed to devise an improved system of detection, communication and control, The system, called the Metropolitan Observation Service, encompassed the London Air <b>Defence</b> <b>Area</b> and would later extend eastwards towards the Kentish and Essex coasts. The Metropolitan Observation Service was fully operational until the late summer of 1918 (the last German bombing raid taking place on [...] 1918).|$|E
