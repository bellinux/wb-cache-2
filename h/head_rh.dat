40|$|A {{number of}} commercially {{available}} radial <b>head</b> (<b>RH)</b> implants {{are used for}} the management of RH fractures. The optimal shape of a RH implant to restore joint mechanics to the native state has not been established. This work compares radiocapitellar contact and kinematics for three implant designs as well as the native RH. These implants include an axisymmetric, a quasi-anatomic and a patient-specific design. When compared to the native RH, only the axisymmetric implant was significantly different in contact area (p= 0. 008). Active and passive forearm supination was assessed for differences in translations of the RH. Significant differences were found in anterior-posterior translations during active forearm supination between the axisymmetric implant and the native RH (p= 0. 014) and between the quasi-anatomic implant and native RH (p= 0. 019). This work demonstrates that while an anatomic implant slightly improves radiocapitellar contact and kinematics, future efforts are needed to optimize the materials employed in these devices...|$|E
40|$|Foi avaliada a morfopatologia espermática do sêmen de coelhos alimentados com rações contendo diferentes níveis de selenometionina (SeM) e vitamina C (VC). Utilizaram-se 125 coelhos, alojados individualmente, e distribuídos em um delineamento {{experimental}} inteiramente casualizado, com vinte e cinco tratamentos e cinco repetições. Avaliaram-se a normalidade espermática (NO), patologias totais (PT), patologias primárias (PP) e patologias secundárias (PS). Observou-se influência dos tratamentos com SeM e VC (p < 0, 05) sobre: PT, PP, PS, cauda dobrada (CD), cauda abaxial (CAB), capuchão solto (CAPS), cabeça raquetiforme (CARE), cauda solta (CAUSO), cauda enrolada na porção final (CENF), gota citoplasmática distal (GODI), gota citoplasmática proximal (GOPR), microcefalia (MICRO). O SeM e VC aumentaram (p < 0, 05) os índices de: PT, PP, CD, CAB, CARE, CAUSO, GODI até níveis intermediários e depois voltaram a decrescer. A vitamina C diminuiu o número de microcefalias à medida que houve o aumento na dieta, demonstrando o efeito de proteção antioxidante aos espermatozóides. The spermatic morphopathology in the semen of rabbits, {{fed with}} rations containing different selenomethionine (SeM) and vitamin C (VC) levels, were evaluated. 125 male rabbits kept individually in cage were used. They were distributed {{in a completely}} randomized design with twenty-five treatments and five replications. The following items were evaluated: sperm normality (SN), total pathologies (TP), primary pathologies (PP) and secondary pathologies (SP). An influence of treatments with SeM and VC (p < 0. 05) on: TP, PP, SP, bent tail (BT), abaxial tail (AT), free cap (FC), raquetiform <b>head</b> (<b>RH),</b> loose tail (LT), final coiled tail (FCT), distal droplet (DD), proximal droplet (PD), and microcephalic sperm (MS) was observed. Treatments with SeM and VC increased until an intermediate level and later it reduced the rates of: TP, PP, BT, AT, RH, LT and DD. The microcephalic sperm decreased when vitamin C level was increased, demonstrating the antioxidant protection effect on the spermatozoa...|$|E

5000|$|The Sun-Sentinel traces {{its history}} to the 1910 {{founding}} of the Fort Lauderdale Weekly Herald, the first known newspaper in the Fort Lauderdale area, and the Everglades Breeze, a locally printed paper founded in 1911, which promoted itself as [...] "Floridas great Farm, Truck and Fruit Growing paper." [...] In 1925, the Everglades Breeze was renamed the Sentinel. That same year, two Ohio publishers bought both the Sentinel and the Herald, consolidating the newspapers into a daily publication called the Daily News and Evening Sentinel. In 1926, Horace and Tom Stillwell purchased the paper. However, the devastation wrought by the 1926 Miami hurricane caused circulation to drop and, in 1929, Tom Stillwell sold the paper to the Gore Publishing Company, <b>headed</b> by <b>R.H.</b> Gore, Sr. By 1945, circulation of the Daily News and Evening Sentinel had climbed to 10,000.|$|R
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} {{epidemiology}} of head injury (HI) in infants, the factors favouring {{the occurrence of}} a subdural haematoma (SDH), the prevalence of retinal haemorrhages (RH) and the prognostic factors, by comparing the non-accidental (NAHI) and accidental (AHI) <b>head</b> injuries. <b>RH,</b> in particular, are of fundamental value in the diagnosis of NAHI but, {{in the absence of}} systematic studies, their sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of the NAHI have rarely been assessed. METHOD: We prospectively collected the clinical, ophthalmologic and radiological data of HI occurring in children under 24 months old, notably by distinguishing essential macrocrania and symptomatic macrocrania of an SDH, by classifying the HI according to its severity. RESULTS: We observed 88 cases over a period of 22 months. It 28 cases it was NAHI and in the 60 others, AHI. The SDH was often correlated with the presence of retinal haemorrhages and the absence of signs of cranial impact, but not with child abuse or with essential macrocrania. The RH were of great importance in the diagnosis of NAHI; however, non-severe RH was noted in 4 cases of AHI. The neurological prognosis was essentially correlated with the initial clinical severity. CONCLUSION: Although only representing 33 % of cases, child abuse was responsible for 2 / 3 of the deaths and for the totality of the severe morbidity in our series. The infants exhibiting perinatal problems represented an important group at risk of abuse, which justified their regular medical-social follow-up...|$|R
40|$|To build large {{collections}} of medical terms from semi-structured information sources (e. g. tables, lists, etc.) and encyclopedia {{sites on the}} web. The terms are classified into the three semantic categories, Medical Problems, Medications, and Medical Tests, which were used in i 2 b 2 challenge tasks. We developed two systems, one for Chinese and another for English terms. The two systems share the same methodology and use the same software with minimum language dependent parts. We produced large {{collections of}} terms by exploiting billions of semi-structured information sources and encyclopedia sites on the Web. The standard performance metric of recall (R) is extended to three different types of Recall to take the surface variability of terms into consideration. They are Surface Recall (R(S)), Object Recall (R(O)), and Surface <b>Head</b> recall (<b>R(H)).</b> We use two test sets for Chinese. For English, we use a collection of terms in the 2010 i 2 b 2 text. Two collections of terms, one for English {{and the other for}} Chinese, have been created. The terms in these collections are classified as either of Medical Problems, Medications, or Medical Tests in the i 2 b 2 challenge tasks. The English collection contains 49, 249 (Problems), 89, 591 (Medications) and 25, 107 (Tests) terms, while the Chinese one contains 66, 780 (Problems), 101, 025 (Medications), and 15, 032 (Tests) terms. The proposed method of constructing a large collection of medical terms is both efficient and effective, and, most of all, independent of language. The collections will be made publicly available...|$|R
40|$|According to Dr. P. L. Sclater (Nature, September 25, 1890, p. 520) Mr. F. Selous {{says in the}} Field of August 16 as follows: — »it {{was within}} a mile of this spot that, two years {{previously}} (i. e. in 1888), I shot two white Rhinoceroses Rhinoceros simus), the last of their kind that have been killed (and, perhaps, that ever will be killed) by an Englishman. They were male and female, and I preserved the skin of the head and the skull of the former for the South African Museum in Cape town, where they now are [...] To the best of my belief, the great white or square-mouthed Rhinoceros, the largest of modern terrestrial mammals after the Elephant, is on the very verge of extinction, and {{in the next year or}} two will become absolutely extinct. If in the near future some student of natural history should wish to know what this extinct beast really was like, he will find nothing in all the Museums of Europe and America to enlighten him upon the subject, but some half-dozen skulls and a goodly number of the anterior horns. ” After having pointed out the four striking characteristics by which the <b>heads</b> of <b>Rh.</b> simus and Rh. bicornis may be distinguished, Dr. Sclater concludes as follows: »I wish to call special attention to what Mr. Selous has already said — that no Museum in Europe or America possesses a specimen of this huge animal and to point out that the country, in which alone (as is possible but by no means certain) the last stragglers exist, being now within the British Empire, it is clearly our duty to endeavour to obtain and preserve examples of the great white or square-mouthed Rhinoceros for the use and information of posterity. ...|$|R
