[...] He {{acquired}} a broken-down carousel in a junk yard in Los Angeles, and some broken horses in Kansas City. He and his entourage then headed for Drury, Kansas. The original working title of the film was Around. While exploring film title designs for the picture, Carradine came across a style called Americana. [...] "I {{was trying to figure}} out what it would look like if it said Around. Suddenly, I said to myself, 'Why am I doing this, anyway?

500|$|Despite {{protests from}} crewmen, {{who wanted the}} remains hosed over the deck, Callaghan insisted that the young Japanese airman had done his job {{to the best of}} his ability, with honor, and {{deserved}} a military funeral. Stephen Cromwell, a corpsman at the time, later recalled, [...] "I was able to recover his body and <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>up</b> to the bridge to ask if I should throw it overboard ... Captain Callaghan said, ‘No, when we secure, take it down to the sick bay, and we'll have a burial for him tomorrow.’" [...] Ivan Dexter, another crew member, gave his account of events to Herb Fahr, recalling that {{the top half of the}} Japanese pilot's body was scattered over the deck, while the bottom half fell with the rest of the plane into the sea. What remained of the body was brought to sick bay for examination, and various Missouri crew took souvenirs from the clothing, including the helmet, scarf, and jacket. Following examination, the remains were placed in a canvas bag with dummy shell casings to weigh it down.|$|E

500|$|In 1968, Fisher re-entered {{private law}} practice, again with Covington & Burling (during the Dwight D. Eisenhower Administration (1953–60) Fisher joined the Covington firm, with Dean Acheson, {{for the first}} time) and became General Counsel to the Washington Post. Fisher's {{connection}} with the Washington Post arose because of his close friendship with the Post's then-owner Phillip Graham since his early days in Washington, D.C. [...] Both Fisher and Graham had clerked for Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter and had shared a rented house (belonging to future Secretary of State Dean Acheson), together with [...] Donald Hiss (brother of Alger Hiss). From 1969 to 1975, Fisher served as Dean of Georgetown University Law Center, Washington, D.C. According {{to a report in}} the Georgetown student newspaper [...] "The Hoya", Fisher was not solicited as a candidate for the position, but simply submitted his own name. [...] "I heard they were looking around for a new person, so <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>up</b> and asked to be considered." [...] Dean Fisher was installed as the first occupant of the Francis Cabell Brown Chair in International Law of the center on January 25, 1977, and served as law professor from 1977 to 1980.|$|E
500|$|... "Much {{has been}} written about that scene ... most of it silly," [...] wrote Gene Lees in High Fidelity. The scene was {{inspired}} by two men who took off their clothes to antagonize the police during an informal anti-war gathering. [...] During [...] "Where Do I Go?", the stage was covered in a giant scrim, beneath which those choosing to participate in the scene removed their clothes. [...] At the musical cue, [...] "they [...] naked and motionless, their bodies bathed in Fisher's light projection of floral patterns. [...] They chant of 'beads, flowers, freedom, and happiness.'" [...] It lasted only twenty seconds. Indeed, the scene happened so quickly and was so dimly lit that it prompted Jack Benny, during the interval at a London preview, to quip, [...] "Did you happen to notice if any of them were Jewish?" [...] Nevertheless, the scene prompted threats of censorship and even violent reactions in some places. It also became fodder for pop-cultural jokes. Groucho Marx quipped, [...] "I was gonna go see it, and then <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>up</b> the theater. ... They said the tickets were $11 apiece. I told them I'd call back, went into my bathroom, took off all my clothes, and looked at myself in the full-length mirror. Then I called the theater and said, 'Forget it.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite public attacks {{about his}} {{financial}} status, after {{meeting at the}} National Association of Broadcasters convention in Las Vegas, Nevada in April 2001, it was Hammer (credited as a producer) who provided the much needed funding to filmmaker Justin Lin for Better Luck Tomorrow (2002). In its first ever film acquisition, MTV Films eventually acquired Better Luck Tomorrow after it debuted at The Sundance Film Festival. The director said, [...] "Out of desperation, <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>up</b> MC Hammer because he had read the script and liked it.

2500|$|In April 2011, Variety {{reported}} that Liam Neeson's cameo as a Bangkok tattoo artist {{had been cut}} and Nick Cassavetes had been re-cast in the role. While editing, Phillips cut the scene that immediately followed Neeson's cameo, meaning it {{no longer had the}} information necessary to logically get the main characters to the situation in the next scene. Three weeks later, Phillips decided to reshoot the scene, but with Neeson in London filming Wrath of the Titans, the actor was no longer available. Phillips explained, [...] "We were in a complete time crunch so <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>up</b> Nick and asked if he would do the part. He came in and crushed it and that is the scene that you will ultimately see in the film. [...] to see the film. It turned out great".|$|E
2500|$|At the Pennsylvania Academy [...] Lynch {{made his}} first short film, which was titled Six Men Getting Sick (Six Times) (1967). He had first {{come up with the}} idea when he {{developed}} a wish to see his paintings move, and he subsequently began discussing the idea of creating an animation with an artist named Bruce Samuelson. When this project never came about, Lynch decided to work on a film alone, and so purchased the cheapest 16mm camera that he could find in order to do so. Taking one of the abandoned upper rooms of the Academy as a working space, he spent $200 – which at the time he felt {{to be a lot of}} money – to produce Six Men Getting Sick. Describing the work as [...] "57seconds of growth and fire, and three seconds of vomit", Lynch played the film on a loop at the Academy's annual end-of-year exhibit, where it shared joint first prize with a painting by Noel Mahaffey. This led to a commission from one of his fellow students, the wealthy H. Barton Wasserman, who offered him $1000 to create a film installation in his home. Spending $478.28 of that on purchasing the second-hand Bolex camera [...] "of [...] dreams", Lynch produced a new animated short, but upon getting the film developed, realized that the result was simply a blurred, frameless print. As he would later relate, [...] "So <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>up</b> Bart [...] and said, 'Bart, the film is a disaster. The camera was broken and what I've done hasn't turned out.' And he said, 'Don't worry, David, take the rest of the money and make something else for me. Just give me a print.' End of story." ...|$|E

5000|$|In a press {{statement}} {{after the}} show, {{the director of}} Endemol, Paul Römer, stated [...] "Let there be no misunderstanding, I would never make a program such as 'The Big Donor Show' for real. I do understand the massive outrage very well. But I also hope {{for people to understand}} why we did this. It was necessary to get the shortage of donors back on the political agenda. <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>up</b> everybody to get very angry about that, and to fill in a donor form." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{the next}} Monday morning, after I had {{attained}} the wise age [...] of 4 years, that <b>I</b> was <b>called</b> <b>up</b> into my mother's room, and told [...] that I {{was the next}} day going to school.|$|R
