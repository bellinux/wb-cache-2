5|$|When {{asked how}} he, {{as the son}} of Holocaust survivors, felt about Israel’s {{operation}} in Gaza, Finkelstein replied:It {{has been a long time}} since I felt any emotional connection with the state of Israel, which relentlessly and brutally and inhumanly keeps these vicious, murderous wars. It is a vandal state. There is a Russian writer who once described vandal states as Genghis Khan with a telegraph. Israel is Genghis Khan with a computer. I feel no emotion of affinity with that state. I have some good friends and their families there, and of course I would not want any of them to be hurt. That said, sometimes I feel that Israel <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of the boils (sic) of the hell, a satanic state.|$|E
5|$|Now in a {{committed}} relationship, Rachel and Adam begin trying for a baby. The storyline was devised because Harries wanted Cold Feet to reflect relevant issues in contemporary society; {{in vitro fertilisation}} featured heavily in the news during 2000, and Harries felt that incorporating it into the series would help {{to raise awareness of}} it, as well as provide fodder for the characters' story arcs. Rachel's intracytoplasmic sperm injection treatment incorporated aspects of the real life IVF treatment experienced by Harries and his wife Rebecca Frayn, and eminent fertility scientist Sammy Lee was consulted extensively throughout the development of the plot. After spending several thousand pounds on IVF treatment, Rachel's doctor informs her that she is infertile due to Asherman's syndrome, most likely caused by her abortion. Despite being unable to have children naturally, Rachel and Adam are determined to continue their relationship; Adam proposes to her and they are married in a civil ceremony in Series 3, Episode 8. In the same episode, she is reunited with her estranged parents, Brian and Mary (Paul Ridley and Sue Holderness). Before the episode, Rachel had not spoken to them for years; her father because of his bigotry and abuse of her mother, and her mother for staying with him. She refuses to allow Paul to give her away, and instead asks David to, despite learning that he has been having an extra-marital affair. At the reception, she inadvertently reveals to her parents that her sister, their other daughter Lucy, <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> as a lesbian.|$|E
