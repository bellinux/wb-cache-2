500|$|After one-hitting Boston on May 2, 1904, Philadelphia Athletics pitcher Rube Waddell taunted Young to {{face him}} {{so that he could}} repeat his {{performance}} against Boston's ace. Three days later, Young pitched a perfect game against Waddell and the Athletics. It was the first perfect game in American League history. Waddell was the 27th and last batter, and when he flied out, Young shouted, [...] "How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> you hayseed?" [...] Waddell had picked an inauspicious time to issue his challenge. Young's perfect game was the centerpiece of a pitching streak. Young set major league records for the most consecutive scoreless innings pitched and the most consecutive innings without allowing a hit; the latter record still stands at 25.1 innings, or 76 hitless batters. Even after allowing a hit, Young's scoreless streak reached a then-record 45 shutout innings. Before Young, only two pitchers had thrown perfect games. This occurred in 1880, when Lee Richmond and John Montgomery Ward pitched perfect games within five days of each other, although under somewhat different rules: the front edge of the pitcher's box was only [...] from home base (the modern release point is about [...] farther away); walks required eight balls; and pitchers were obliged to throw side-armed. Young's perfect game was the first under the modern rules established in 1893. One year later, on July 4, 1905, Rube Waddell beat Young and the Americans, 42, in a 20-inning matchup. Young pitched 13 consecutive scoreless innings before he gave up a pair of unearned runs in the final inning. Young did not walk a batter and was later quoted: [...] "For my part, I think it was the greatest game of ball I ever took part in." [...] In 1907, Young and Waddell faced off in a scoreless 13-inning tie.|$|E
2500|$|The Texians {{demanded to}} know where the other captives were. The Penateka spokesman, Chief Muguara, responded that the other prisoners were held by various other bands of Comanche. He assured the Texians that he felt the other captives would be able to be ransomed, but that it would be in {{exchange}} for a great deal of supplies, including ammunition and blankets. He then finished his speech with the comment [...] "How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> answer?" [...] The Texian militia entered the courtroom and positioned themselves at intervals along the walls. When the Comanches would not, or could not, promise to return all captives immediately, the Texas officials said that the chiefs would be held hostage until the white captives were released.|$|E

6000|$|... "Would {{you like}} me to tell you another story? It is about a little girl. Well, there was once a {{minister}} and his wife, and they hadn't no little girls, but just little boys, and God was sorry for them, so He put a little girl in a cabbage in the garden, and when they found her they were glad. Would {{you like me}} to tell you who the little girl was? Well, it was me, and, ugh! I was awful cold in the cabbage. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> story?" ...|$|E

He looked flushed and serious, and I supposed {{that he had seen}} something to alarm him in the condition of his child. His sister apparently had another idea; she gazed at him a moment {{as if he were a}} burning ship on the horizon, and simply murmured, [...] "Poor old Mark!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come," [...] {{she said}} brusquely; [...] "now you're in for it you must {{play the game}} out. He trusts you; if he sees you can't trust yourself, he'll shoot you on sight.
