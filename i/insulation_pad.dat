40|$|After {{coronary}} artery bypass, some patients have diaphragmatic elevation, usually {{on the left}} side. To test our hypothesis that this phenomenon is due to phrenic nerve injury resulting from either 1) dissection of the proximal portion of the left internal mammary artery or 2) topical cooling of the heart with icy slush, we performed the following 2 -part study. First, we reviewed our hospital records of 99 {{coronary artery}} bypass patients, 55 of whom had received left internal mammary artery grafts and 44 of whom had undergone saphenous vein grafting; the results showed {{no significant difference between}} the rates of left-sided diaphragmatic paralysis in the 2 groups (47 % versus 41 %, respectively). Next, we performed a prospective, randomized study in 100 consecutive patients, using a cardiac <b>insulation</b> <b>pad</b> to protect the left phrenic nerve in 58 patients and using no protective pad in 42 patients. At the time of hospital discharge, left-sided diaphragmatic elevation was seen in 6 (10. 3 %) of the 58 patients in whom insulation had been used and in 19 (45. 2 %) of the 42 patients whose phrenic nerve had been unprotected (p < 0. 001). We conclude that cooling of the left phrenic nerve with icy slush in the pericardial cavity causes left-sided diaphragmatic paralysis and that the frequency of this injury can be reduced if a cardiac <b>insulation</b> <b>pad</b> is placed between the nerve and the icy slush.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{experimental}} verification and experimental-based improvements of designed low temperature parts of {{stage of the}} UHV SEM/SPM microscope, which operates in temperature range from 20 K to 700 K. The main {{focus is on the}} functionality verification of thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>pad</b> (InBallPad) {{as well as on the}} effect of length and contact quality of braid on minimal achievable temperature. The contact quality of sample holder with sample carrier realized with two springs is investigated together with influence of thermal contact resistances on achievable temperature. The thesis also contains a calculation model used for cooldown times and minimal temperature estimation. In the conclusion of this work several future experiments are suggested which could explain some of the observed, yet unexpected, phenomena...|$|E
40|$|The {{aluminum}} skin of {{the space}} shuttle is covered by a thermal protection system (TPS) consisting of a low density ceramic tile bonded to a matted-felt material called strain <b>insulation</b> <b>pad</b> (SIP). The structural characteristics of the TPS were studied experimentally under selected extreme load conditions. Three basic types of loads were imposed: tension, eccentrically applied tension, and combined in-plane force and transverse pressure. For some tests, transverse pressure was applied rapidly to simulate a transient shock wave passing over the tile. The failure mode for all specimens involved separation of the tile from the SIP at the silicone rubber bond interface. An eccentrically applied tension load caused the tile to separate from the SIP at loads lower than experienced at failure for pure tension loading. Moderate in-plane as well as shock loading did not cause a measurable reduction in the TPS ultimate failure strength. A strong coupling, however, was exhibited between in-plane and transverse loads and displacements...|$|E

To reflect the demands in competitive sport, additional experiments were conducted with well-trained endurance athletes exercising in a considerably colder environment (study B).|$|R
30|$|It was {{hypothesized}} that the pants containing <b>insulation</b> <b>pads</b> would reduce heat flux, promote local rises in temperature and thereby reduce submaximal exercise responses, as reflected by reduced blood lactate levels and lower heart rates. Furthermore, {{it was assumed that}} the <b>insulation</b> <b>pads</b> would not hinder overall dissipation of body heat as they covered {{only a small part of}} the whole body surface. Therefore no significant differences in auditory canal and upper body clothing surface temperature were expected between clothing systems.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{description}} of the development of optimized rubber compounds for the various parts of the bead section of low aspect ratio steel-betted radial tines. Four main parts of the bead zone have been considered which are bead insulation, apex, chafer and pad. For each section, a series of compounds have been designed and then based on the measured physical and mechanical properties, they are modified until the pre-defined properties have been achieved. It is shown that based on use of a blend of elastomers and novel combination of different compounding ingredients, optimized rubber compounds for the mentioned parts both from physical properties and economical points of view can be obtained. The use of the developed compounds in the manufacturing of a 175 IT 0 - 14 steel-belted tire and also the results of the indoor and outdoor tire tests generally confirm the validity of the designed rubber compounds.

30|$|Insertion of {{properly}} positioned <b>insulation</b> <b>pads</b> into sports apparel is {{a practical}} approach to limit heat emission from working muscles during endurance exercise in cool environments without impairing overall body-heat dissipation. However, under the environmental conditions and exercise intensities applied in this study, the insulation of working muscles failed to significantly improve parameters reflecting physical effort or perceived exertion. Two reasons might account for that: Either the warming effect of the <b>insulation</b> <b>pads</b> was not large enough to cause significant differences in muscle temperature or muscle temperatures in both pants did not drop to an extent where performance deficits may be expected. Future studies on the benefit of <b>insulation</b> <b>pads</b> should therefore focus on temperature conditions markedly below 0  °C, where a drop in muscle temperature {{is likely to be}} larger. Also muscle temperature should be measured directly.|$|R
30|$|The {{aim of this}} application-oriented {{study was}} to {{determine}} the effects of thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>pads</b> placed over working leg muscles on clothing surface temperature and parameters reflecting thermoregulation, physical effort and perceived exertion during endurance exercise in cool environments. In agreement with the hypothesis, significantly lower TLB for PINSUL compared to PCOOL were found, confirming the insulation effect of the additional pads. Furthermore, no significant differences in TUB and auditory canal temperature were found, which confirms the assumption that the additional <b>insulation</b> <b>pads</b> would not impair thermoregulation during exercise. However, no significant differences in parameters reflecting physical effort or perceived exertion between PINSUL and PCOOL were found.|$|R
30|$|Several methodical {{limitations}} {{of the current study}} must be considered. Instead of measuring muscle temperature directly, thermography recordings were used to confirm the insulating effect of the additional pads. In future studies direct measures of muscle temperature should be used to directly determine the differences in muscle temperature induced by <b>insulation</b> <b>pads.</b> Additionally, submaximal exercise responses were investigated, i.e., blood lactate, heart rate, auditory canal temperature, loss in body mass and perceived exertion. While representative of physical effort, such measures may not accurately reflect exercise performance capacity. Thus, in future studies, the effect of <b>insulation</b> <b>pads</b> on the outcomes of competition like events or endurance performance tests (e.g. time trails or time to exhaustion) should be investigated.|$|R
30|$|The {{rationale}} to test <b>insulation</b> <b>pads</b> {{placed over}} working muscles {{with the aim}} to improve endurance performance in cool environments was that cold ambient conditions {{may lead to a}} drop in muscle temperature (Parkin et al. 1999). This may be of functional importance since cold muscles show impaired performance (Bennett 1985; Bottinelli et al. 1996; Drinkwater & Behm 2007). To counter the expected decreases in muscle temperature, simple <b>insulation</b> <b>pads</b> were used which, unlike active cooling or warming devices (Faulkner et al. 2012; Gray et al. 2006; Inoue et al. 2014, 2016; Sargeant 1987; Schlader et al. 2011), do not require energy supply and could be easily integrated into sports apparel in real-life scenarios.|$|R
30|$|To {{determine}} the effects of thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>pads</b> on clothing surface temperature, physical effort and perceived exertion during endurance exercise in cool environments two different pants (PCOOL, PINSUL) were designed: PCOOL (Insulation: 0.055 clo) was made of a thin base material while PINSUL (Insulation: 0.131 clo) featured additional <b>insulation</b> <b>pads</b> covering ~[*] 30 % of its surface, which were placed over the working leg muscles. Two sets of experiments were performed to compare both pants: Study A was completed in 10 active sportsmen who were instructed to run on a treadmill for 45  min at 60 % of their maximal running velocity (vmax) at 7  °C. In study B, 8 endurance athletes completed the run with 70 % vmax at 0  °C. Lower and upper body clothing surface temperatures (TLB, TUB), auditory canal temperature, blood lactate, heart rate, subjects´ loss of body mass and perceived exertion were measured. In both studies TLB was found to be lower with PINSUL, reflecting smaller heat loss due to the better thermal insulation. However no significant differences between pants were found for auditory canal temperature, blood lactate, heart rate, subjects´ loss of body mass or perceived exertion. Inserting <b>insulation</b> <b>pads</b> into sports apparel is a practicable approach to limit heat emission from working muscles during endurance exercise in the cold without impairing overall body-heat dissipation. However, under the environmental conditions and exercise intensities tested in this study, the thermal insulation of leg muscles failed to significantly affect parameters reflecting physical effort or perceived exertion.|$|R
30|$|Sports apparel should {{therefore}} meet the competing demands {{to keep working}} muscles warm while still facilitating overall heat dissipation to prevent performance-limiting rises in core temperature. In scientific experiments, various {{attempts have been made}} to locally influence muscle temperature through warm water immersion (Gray et al. 2006; Sargeant 1987), exposure to hot air (Schlader et al. 2011) or integration of heating/cooling elements (Faulkner et al. 2012; Inoue et al. 2014, 2016). As opposed to these attempts to actively modify muscle temperature, it was decided to reduce heat dissipation through <b>insulation</b> <b>pads</b> that are readily implementable into outdoor sports apparel. Specifically, the goal of this study was to determine the effects of thermal insulation of working muscles on clothing surface temperature and parameters reflecting thermoregulation, physical effort and perceived exertion during endurance exercise in cool environments. Two different combinations of sports apparel were compared: One textile system consisted of a thin shirt and pant to maximize overall heat loss through evaporation of sweat, convection and radiation, whereas the other system featured additional thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>pads</b> placed over the leg muscles with the aim to reduce heat flux from working muscles.|$|R
30|$|The {{expected}} {{differences in}} muscle temperature notwithstanding, parameters reflecting physical effort and perceived exertion {{were not significantly}} different between PINSUL and PCOOL. Various factors may explain this result: It is possible that the warming effect of the <b>insulation</b> <b>pads</b> was not large enough to cause significant differences in muscle temperature and, consequently no physiologically relevant differences in physical effort were found. Inoue et al. (2016) induced temperature differences of 4  °C within the muscle to produce a significant effect on endurance performance. It is also possible that, even with the non-insulating PCOOL, muscle temperatures did not drop to an extent where performance deficits may be expected (Noakes 2000). While exercise intensities and climatic conditions were deliberately selected to represent typical conditions encountered by recreationally active sportsmen who exercise in a cool environment (study A) or well-trained athletes exercising in a cold environment (study B), lower exercise intensities in combination with colder environmental conditions are expected to result in more drastic decreases in muscle temperature. In future studies the effect of <b>insulation</b> <b>pads</b> should be evaluated in climatic conditions typical for cold-weather endurance sports like cross country skiing where training and competition are often performed in temperatures below −  15  °C (Larsson et al. 1993).|$|R

50|$|In 1942 and 1943, several C-87 {{aircraft}} {{were converted}} into VIP luxury passenger transports by adding <b>insulation,</b> <b>padded</b> seats, dividers, and other accommodations. The modified aircraft {{was capable of}} carrying 16 passengers, and given the designation C-87A. One C-87A in particular, serial 41-24159, was exclusively converted in 1943 to a presidential VIP transport, the Guess Where II, intended to carry President Franklin D. Roosevelt on international trips. Had it been accepted, {{it would have been}} the first aircraft to be used in presidential service, i.e. the first Air Force One. However, the Secret Service, after a review of the C-87's controversial safety record in service, flatly refused to approve the Guess Where II for presidential carriage. The Guess Where II was then used to transport senior members of the Roosevelt administration. In March 1944, the Guess Where II transported Eleanor Roosevelt on a goodwill tour of several Latin American countries.|$|R
30|$|With PINSUL, TLB were {{significantly}} lower as compared to PCOOL. Lower surface temperatures reflect smaller heat loss due to better thermal insulation (Al-Homoud 2005). During exercise, muscles produce heat with heat production being directly proportional to exercise intensity (Gonzalez-Alonso et al. 2000; Jette et al. 1990). The lower heat emission observed with PINSUL is expected to promote higher local temperatures underneath the insulated areas. However, conclusions about the effects on muscle temperature remain speculative since (highly invasive) direct measurements were precluded in this study. No significant differences in TUB and auditory canal temperature between pants were found, implicating that thermoregulation was not negatively influenced by the additional <b>insulation</b> <b>pads.</b> Studies by Fournet et al. (2015) and Gavin et al. (2001) confirm these results. They showed that neither clothing systems featuring the same overall insulation but varying local insulation, nor small differences in overall clothing insulation have a significant influence on core temperature while exercising at intensities comparable to the ones applied in this study.|$|R
40|$|The {{capability}} to predict hot spot in solidifying castings is the utmost important issues during parts design. The present study investigated a simple method to predict temperature profile and possible hot spot in solidifying castings based on medial axis interpolation. One {{of the major}} features of medial objects {{is that it is}} a reduced topology of three-dimensional geometry. Hence, a geometrically complex three-dimensional object can be represented by a combination of medial objects, e. g., 2 - 3 D surfaces and lines. This allows the large amount of geometrical information to be stored with minimal space requirement and the three dimensional object can be manipulated in a two-dimensional space. In this study, we exploit this particular property of medial objects and its possible application to casting. This study proposes a medial axis-based geometric technique that could be used to optimize the <b>insulation</b> <b>padding</b> around the cast-mould interface. Numerical simulation showed that the current geometric method was successful in relocating the hotspot in casting the feeder...|$|R
40|$|Objective—To {{evaluate}} {{the ability of}} industrial polystyrene foam <b>insulation</b> <b>pads</b> to redistribute loads placed on clinically normal weight-bearing structures of the foot and shift {{the location of the}} center of pressure palmarly in horses. Animals— 25 nonlame mature horses. Procedures—Both forefeet from each horse were evaluated. Center of pressure data and solar load distribution patterns were recorded during a 5 -second trial by use of a commercial pressure measurement system prior to placement of foam sole support and at 0, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours after placement. Total contact surface area, contact pressure, peak contact pressure, and center of pressure positions were compared by use of a linear mixed model with repeated measurements. Results—Total contact surface area was increased significantly at all time points, whereas contact pressure and peak contact pressure were significantly decreased at all time points following application of foam sole supports. Immediately following application of sole support, the position of the center of pressure was significantly moved cranially. However, by 48 hours, the center of pressure was significantly positioned more palmarly than prior to application of the foam supports. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—Results indicated that the use of foam sole supports may be an effective, economical, and immediate treatment for acute laminitis...|$|R

50|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, newer {{materials}} were superseding Bakelite in many areas.

40|$|Architecture {{evolved from}} a need for shelter to an {{experience}} for everyone to enjoy. Hotel chains, owners, employees and other industry experts realize that the static image they present does not appeal to a younger generation. Since the markets are changing to a younger generation, hotels are racing to meet demands. The purpose {{of this research was}} to analyze the impact that design and style have on the overall patron experience, likelihood to recommend, likelihood to return to the particular hotel, and the influence the stay had on the hotel brand. Conclusions have been formulated using several regression analyses, and a Pearson correlation. Results indicate that overall experience, intent to recommend and intent to return are influenced by television quality. An additional factor affecting the intent to recommend is the quality of carpet, drapes and bedspreads. Regression analyses show a significant relationship between the intent to return and the quietness of the room as well as the affect of lobby appearance on the hotel brand. Based on this analysis, several recommendations were offered. The Holiday Inn Express needs to explore new methods to increase television scores. Adding DVD/ VCR players, pay-per-view movies, and expanding television programming could increase scores. To address carpet, drapes and bedspreads scores, new colors, patterns and fabrics should be considered to update the hotel. New <b>insulation,</b> thicker <b>padding,</b> and nailing down loose floor-boards, would decrease the noise within the hotel.

40|$|We have {{developed}} an ultra small, translucent array of electrodes {{for use in the}} parasaggital cerebellar slice preparation. This positionable array is capable of stimulating multiple independent bundles of parallel fibers (PFs), which synapse onto a single Purkinje neuron. On a silicon substrate, a low-stress silicon nitride film was used both as a structural layer and as electrical <b>insulation.</b> Evaporated gold <b>pads</b> and interconnects were sandwiched between two such layers. A bulk anisotropic silicon etch released the individual arrays. The electrodes are supported within a 2 -m-thick cantilever of translucent silicon nitride. In one design, eight 4 -m-wide square electrodes are arranged on 8 -m-centers. Another design, half the scale of the first, was also tested. The array was mounted on a micromanipulator and can be visualized by an upright microscope. It can then be positioned in the dendritic arbor of a Purkinje neuron while not disturbing a recording pipette at the soma. Paired-pulse facilitation experiments have confirmed that the electrodes are capable of stimulating non-overlapping bundles of PFs. This device will be useful for exploring spatiotemporal synaptic integration in single neurons. Potential applications in experiments on cerebellar LTD are also discussed. © 2003 Elsevier B. V.
