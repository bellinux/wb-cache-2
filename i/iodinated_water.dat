40|$|Iodine {{is used to}} {{disinfect}} potable water on United States spacecraft. Iodinated potable water will likely be used to grow plants in space. Little {{is known about the}} effects of iodine disinfection products on plants. Seeds of select higher plants were germinated in water iodinated using the Shuttle Microbial Check Valve, and water to which measured amounts of iodine was added. Percent germination was decreased in seeds of most species germinated in <b>iodinated</b> <b>water.</b> Beans were most affected. Germination rates, determined from germination half-times, were decreased for beans germinated in <b>iodinated</b> <b>water,</b> and water to which iodide was added. Development was retarded and rootlets were conspicuously absent in bean and several other plant species germinated in <b>iodinated</b> <b>water.</b> Iodide alone did not elicit these responses. Clearly iodine disinfection products can affect higher plants. These effects must be carefully considered for plant experimentation and cultivation in space, and in design and testing of closed environmental life support systems...|$|E

A review of the effects on the thyroid following consumption o <b>iodinated</b> <b>water</b> by NASA astronauts was conducted. Pharmacological doses of iodine consumed by astronauts transiently decreased thyroid function, as reflected in serum TSH values.

Data from supplementa-tion programs and elsewhere indicate that adults need to ingest at least 150 – 200 µg iodine per day (1 – 3). Hollowell et al.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that, {{although}} <b>iodinated</b> swimming-pool <b>waters</b> are usually free from coliform bacteria and enterococci, the total counts frequently become relatively high. Pseudomonas alcaligenes and Alcaligenes faecalis {{have been shown to}} account for most of these high counts. It was of interest, therefore, to compare the microbial flora of four alternately chlorinated and iodinated swimming pools. By means of the membrane filter method and suitable selective media, examinations were made for total viable counts, coliform bacteria, enterococci, staphylococci, Streptococcus salivarius, and P. aeruginosa. Colonies also were picked from membrane filters incubated on standard plate count agar and identified. The results showed that, although viable counts were significantly higher during the iodinated periods, the specific types of bacteria determined were either fewer than or the same as in chlorinated periods. During chlorination, the predominant microbial flora consisted of staphylococci and members of the genus Bacillus. During iodination, however, the P. alcaligenes-A. faecalis group accounted for 92 to 99 % of the microbial flora. The accumulation of high numbers of these bacteria was shown to be due to their iodine resistance and their ability to grow rapidly in pool water in the absence of free iodine...|$|R

40|$|Iodine {{has been}} used as a potable water {{treatment}} and storage bactericidal agent by NASA for over three decades beginning with the Apollo program, and was a critical factor for the achievement of human space flight. Iodine is currently used for Space Shuttle potable water microbial control and is planned for the U. S. com-ponent of the International Space Station (ISS). Human consumption of <b>iodinated</b> <b>water</b> is known to transiently affect thyroid-related hormone levels (acute Wolff-Chaikoff effect) and potentially may result in acute and/or chronic thyroid dys-function in susceptible individuals.

The original aqueous IATCS coolant used in Node 1, the Laboratory Module, and the Airlock consisted of water, borate (pH buffer), phosphate (corrosion control), and silver sulfate (microbiological control) at a pH of 9. 5 +/- 0. 5. Chemical changes occurred after on-orbit implementation including a decrease to pH 8. 4 due to the diffusion of carbon dioxide through the Teflon hoses, an increase in nickel ions due to general corrosion of heat exchanger braze coatings, a decrease in phosphate concentration due to precipitation of nickel phosphate, and the rapid disappearance of silver ions due to deposition on hardware surfaces. Also associated with the coolant chemistry changes {{was an increase in}} planktonic microorganisms from less than 100 colony forming units (CFU) per 100 ml to approximately 1 million CFU per 100 ml. Attachment and growth of microorganisms to the system surfaces (biofilm) was suspected due to the levels of planktonic microorganisms in the coolant. Biofilms can reduce coolant flow, reduce heat transfer, amplify degradation of system materials initiated by chemical corrosion, and enhance mineral scale formation...|$|E

40|$|The use of persulfate {{oxidation}} processes {{is receiving}} increasing {{interest for the}} removal of aquatic contaminants. However, it is unknown whether its application in the presence of iodide has the potential to directly form iodinated DBPs. This study investigated formation of six chlorinated, brominated and iodinated di-haloacetamides (DHAcAms) during persulfate oxidation in the presence of bromide and iodide. Formation of the same DHAcAms during chlorination was monitored for comparison. Persulfate oxidation of natural water formed diiodoacetamide (DIAcAm), and heat-activated persulfate, at 45 °C and 55 °C, generated bromoiodoacetamide (BIAcAm) and dibromoacetamide (DBAcAm), besides DIAcAm. At an ambient iodide concentration of 0. 3 μM, total DHAcAms increased slightly from 0. 43 to 0. 57 nM as the water temperature increased from 4 °C to 35 °C, respectively (only DIAcAm detected), then significantly increased to 1. 6 nM at 55 °C (DIAcAm, BIAcAm and DBAcAm detected). Equivalent total DHAcAm concentrations in the presence of 3. 0 μM iodide were 0. 5, 0. 91 and 2. 1 nM, respectively. Total DHAcAms formed during chlorination, predominantly dichloroacetamide (DCAcAm) and bromochloroacetamide (BCAcAm), were always significantly higher than that during persulfate oxidation. However, an integrated risk assessment showed the toxicity resulting from the DHAcAms was higher during persulfate oxidation than chlorination. An increase in water temperature from 25 °C to 55 °C significantly increased the integrated toxic risk values for both persulfate oxidation and chlorination. Use of persulfate oxidation should be weighed against the formation of high-toxicity <b>iodinated</b> HAcAms in <b>waters</b> with high ambient iodide concentrations...|$|R
40|$|Trihalomethanes are {{predominantly}} formed during disinfection of water via {{reactions of the}} oxidant with natural organic matter. Even though chlorinated and brominated trihalomethanes are the most widespread organic contaminants in drinking water, when iodide is present in raw <b>water</b> <b>iodinated</b> trihalomethanes can also be formed. The formation of iodinated trihalomethanes can lead to taste and odor problems and is a potential health concern since they {{have been reported to}} be more toxic than their brominated or chlorinated analogs. Currently, there is no published standard analytical method for I-THMs in water. The analysis of 10 trihalomethanes in water samples in a single run is challenging because the iodinated trihalomethanes are found at very low concentrations (ng/L range), while the regulated chlorinated and brominated trihalomethanes are present at much higher concentrations (above μg/L). An automated headspace solid-phase microextraction technique, with a programmed temperature vaporizer inlet coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, was developed for routine analysis of 10 trihalomethanes i. e. bromo-, chloro- and iodo-trihalomethanes in water samples. The carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene fiber was found to be the most suitable. The optimization, linearity range, accuracy and precision of the method are discussed. The limits of detection range from 1 ng/L to 20 ng/L for iodoform and chloroform, respectively. Matrix effects in treated groundwater, surfacewater, seawater, and secondary wastewater were investigated and it was shown that the method is suitable for the analysis of trace levels of iodinated trihalomethanes {{in a wide range of}} waters.

The aim of our {{study was to examine}} whether aIFN accelerated the development of thyroiditis in genetically susceptible mice. We took advantage of NOD-H 2 h 4, a genetically susceptible animal model, which develops thyroiditis when fed a high iodine diet. Six to eight week old male NOD H 2 h 4 mice were injected with mouse aIFN (200 units) or with saline three times a week for 8 weeks. All mice drank <b>iodinated</b> <b>water</b> (0. 15 %). Mice were sacrificed after 8 weeks of injection. Their thyroids were examined for histology and blood was tested for antithyroglobulin antibody levels. T 4 and glucose levels were also assessed.

None of the mice developed clinical thyroiditis or diabetes mellitus. Our results showed that aIFN treatment did not accelerate thyroiditis in this mouse model. This may imply that aIFN induces thyroiditis in a non-genetically dependent manner, and this would not be detected in a genetically susceptible mouse model if the effect were small. Alternatively, it is possible that aIFN did not induce thyroiditis in mice because, unlike in humans, in mice aIFN does not induce Th 1 switching...|$|E

40|$|Water {{security}} and quality are a global issue of concern, which have recently become alarming {{due to the}} growth of the human population, industrialisation and expanded agricultural activities. Biologically active compounds, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products can have major adverse effects on aquatic organisms, and are therefore one of the biggest threats in water quality. Another major concern is the spread of waterborne pathogens, including multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria, which can cause serious illnesses in humans. In order to maintain water abundance and quality, it is necessary that adequate wastewater treatment and analytical techniques allowing for sensitive and fast-response detection of water hazards are in place. Conventional (waste) water treatment technologies often fail to adequately remove all of the water hazards detailed above. Moreover, conventional analytical techniques currently used in water quality control are, although highly selective and sensitive, time-extensive, with throughput of merely 2 to 3 samples per hour, excluding the time for sample preparation. With respect to these drawbacks, research was proposed to explore new approaches for degradation of recalcitrant compounds, inactivation of microorganisms, and fast screening methods, which are listed in the second chapter of this dissertation as research objectives. In the third chapter, an extensive theoretical background on the hazards found in aquatic environment, namely pharmaceuticals and waterborne pathogens, is given. Pharmaceuticals enter the environment through several routes (disposal of unused medication via the toilet, pharmaceuticals passing through the human body unchanged/slightly transformed, animal excretions of pharmaceutically active compounds, insufficient wastewater treatment, etc.) therefore, traces of pharmaceuticals have repeatedly been reported in surface waters, groundwater, wastewater effluents, and even drinking <b>water.</b> <b>Iodinated</b> contrast agents (ICAs), as the compounds of interest in this project are further described. ICAs are eliminated from the human body practically unchangedtherefore a large proportion of them end up in municipal and hospital wastewater, where they can be present in concentrations of up to 2. 4 g/L. Their ecotoxicity, degradation attempts, as well as detection monitoring in the environment are reviewed within the chapter. Additionally, waterborne pathogens, which account for 2. 2 million deaths per year, are reviewed in this chapter, with emphasis on multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. Although MDR infections are mostly prevalent in hospital environments, the presence of MDR bacteria in the environment is not a rarity. A high percentage of bacterial isolates in waters {{have been shown to be}} of an MDR phenotype. The theoretical background in analytical methods in water quality monitoring is also given in this chapter. Vanguard and rearguard techniques are explained, the first offering simple, cheap, and rapid sample screening, but sacrificing sensitivity and selectivity, whereas the second providing the highest quality information, excellent sensitivity and selectivity, but in expense of complicated and timely sample handling and high-cost instruments. By combining the two techniques the benefits of both can be exploited in a single system. The basic principles of thermal lens spectrometry (TLS) and its miniaturised version - the thermal lens microscopy (TLM) as fast screening methods providing high sensitivity are further explained, and their practical applications are reviewed. Furthermore, composite materials have recently been finding applications in water treatment technologies, as filter materials, adsorptives for pollutants, catalysts for degradation reactions, and disinfectants. The applications of three main types of composites: synthetic composites, biocomposites, and nanocomposites, are also reviewed within this chapter. The core of this dissertation is presented in the fourth and the fifth chapter, which examine two separate approaches for water treatment, as well as analytical methods for fast screening purposes. The fourth chapter is investigating options for degradation of iodinated X-ray agents (ICAs), namely diatrizoate, through biodegradation with extracellular enzymes of white rot fungus Dichomitus squalens, and chemical oxidation with manganese(III) acetate. Enzymatic degradation with laccase (Lac) and manganese peroxidase (MnP) at low enzymatic activities was unsuccessful, whereas at approximately 3 -times higher activities the enzymes were capable of 60 % degradation in 12 days. Chemical oxidation of diatrizoate with manganese(III) acetate resulted in 85 % degradation in 12 days. Moreover, the suitability of microfluidic flow injection analysis coupled with thermal lens microscopy (μFIA-TLM) as a fast screening method for diatrizoate degradation was examined. The degradation was monitored through the release of iodide from the diatrizoate molecule. μFIA-TLM proved to be a preferable method over UV-Vis spectrophotometry, due to its higher sensitivity, sample throughput, and simple sample handling. Limit of detection (LOD) for μFIA-TLM method was estimated to be 0. 14 µM in a 100 µm channel, which is 9 times lower than LOD obtained in UV-Vis measurements. In addition to μFIA-TLM and UV-VIS, high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to monitor the remaining parent compound in the reaction mix. In the fifth chapter, the second water treatment approach is described. This includes synthesis of biocomposite materials from cellulose (CEL) and keratin (KER), with metal (Ag 0, AgCl, Au 0) nanoparticles (NPs). Materials were characterised for presence, species, and size of NPs with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Nanoparticles were confirmed to be of expected species, with sizes as follows: 6. 3 ± 0. 5 nm for Au NPs, 12 ± 2 nm for Ag NPs, and 22 ± 1 nm for AgCl NPs. In order to evaluate antibacterial properties of the materials, contact tests with gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE)) were conducted. Direct-contact assay over 24 hours showed a dose and species-dependent antibacterial activity of [CEL:KER + Ag NPs] materials. The highest potency against the selected bacteria (up to 6 -log of reduction) was observed for the material with 500 mg of Ag NPs. AgCl NPs appeared to be less potent than Ag NPs, whereas Au NPs exhibited antibacterial activity only against MRSA and VRE. In addition, antiviral properties of materials were investigated on selected bacteriophages (MS 2, phiX 174, and fr). However, biocomposite materials with 500 mg of Ag NPs and AgCl NPs, as well as, 240 mg of Au NPs did not exhibit any activity against selected bacteriophages. Biocompatibility with human fibroblasts was evaluated through a direct contact assay for 3 and 7 days of exposure. High concentrations of metal NPs turned out to be cytotoxic for human fibroblasts, whereas the amount of 69 mg of Ag NPs in [CEL:KER] was low enough not to affect the viability of the fibroblasts after 3 days of exposure. Composites with Ag NPs and AgCl NPs were also tested for leachability of NPs out of the materials. Both types of NPs were leaching out in two different forms, as silver ions, and as colloidal silver. Leaching of ionic silver from both materials stabilised after 3 days, whereas colloidal silver was still leaching out on the 7 th day. The overall percentage of the total silver (ionic + colloidal) leached was only 0. 04 % of silver incorporated in the material. In summary, this dissertation investigates alternative approaches for water treatment technologies, which could potentially serve as unit improvements of existing technologies, or as on-point pre-treatment technologies to facilitate further conventional water treatment techniques. It also demonstrates the suitability of μFIA-TLM for fast screening measurements in aquatic samples, offering high sample throughput, simple handling of the samples and superior sensitivity over the UV-Vis spectrophotometry.

A {{large number of}} tests have been proposed in order to early identify them in the immediate post-operative period but none was completely satisfactory. Actually, there is no data concerning {{the use of an}} early diagnostic protocol based on an intraoperative contrast swallow and a CT- scan at 48  h. Methods and analysis: From may 2012 to February 2017, 281 patients underwent LRYGB. A 40  cc of iodinated water-soluble contrast (Gastrografin® or Telebrix®) was administered through the orogastric tube 5  min after the blue methylene test while 48  h later, they underwent a CT-scan. The early detection of the contrast liquid in the alimentary or bilio-pancreatic limb, in proximity of it or free in the abdomen were considered signs of bowel obstruction or anastomotic leak. Results: 220 were test negative while 35 patients were positive and a second look was carried out successfully. Considering our data, sensitivity was 0, 97 (CI 95 % =  91, 85 – 100 %) while specificity stated at 0, 98 (CI 95 % =  96, 48 – 99, 95 %).

40|$|A {{recently}} described {{method for}} the prevention and treatment of endemic iodine deficiency and goiter, introduction of iodine into a public water supply, was tested in Troina a town of about 13, 000 inhabitants in northeast Sicily. There, before initiationof the program, a goiter endemic of moderate severity was present, as evidenced by goiterprevalence of 55 % in school children. Iodine deficiency in nongoitrous adults was indicated by daily urinary iodine excretion of 40. 7 ± 2. 6 μg (mean ± SE) and 24 -hthyroid radioiodine uptake of 50. 8 ± 2. 4 %. Iodination of the water supply was initiated in November 1979 using a stream-splitting device that diverts a controlled fractionof the total water flow to a canister containing iodine crystals, where the water becomessaturated with iodine (˜ 300 mg/liter) {{before returning to the}} main stream. Except for a 15 -month interruption during which governmental authorization of the programwas being reconfirmed, treatment of the water has continued to the present time, initially at a level of 81 ± 25 μg/liter (mean ± SD) and since resumption at a level of 46. 5 ± 5 μg/liter. Iodination of the water was followed by a prompt and marked reduction in goiter prevalence, and by improvement in biochemical indices of iodine deficiency. By April 1983, overall goiter frequency in school children had declined to 6. 1 %, and large goiters (WHO Grade 2) had virtually disappeared. By January 1984, daily urinary iodine excretion had increased to 85. 6 ± 6. 5 (SEM) μg and radioiodine uptake had decreased to 40. 7 ± 4. 7 %. Serum thyroid-related hormone concentrations were as follows (pretreatment vs. November-December 1983) : T 4 5. 8 ± 0. 3 vs. 8. 4 ± 0. 3 μgdl; T 3 1. 6 ± 0. 05 us. 1. 2 ± 0. 06 ng/ml; TSH, 3. 7 ± 0. 2 us. 2. 2 ± 0. 1 μU/ml; all changes being statistically significant. By late 1983, serum T 4 T 3 and TSH values in Troina were almost identical to those in Catania, a community in which iodine deficiency is not present (goiter prevalence in school children, 2. 2 %). In contrast, in Troina serum T 4 concentrations were significantly higher and serum TSH concentrations were significantly lower than those in Maniaci, a iodine-deficient town near Troina, in which the water was not iodinated. <b>Iodinated</b> <b>water</b> was well tolerated by the population of Troina, and no adverse effectsof water iodination, including any increase in the frequency of hyperthyroidism, was observed. At present prices, the cost of the water iodination program in Troina would be approximately 4 cents (U. S.) per person per year.
