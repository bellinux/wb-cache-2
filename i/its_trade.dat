5|$|After {{two months}} of planning, Bonaparte decided that France's naval power was not yet strong enough to confront the British Royal Navy. He decided on a {{military}} expedition to seize Egypt and thereby undermine Britain's access to <b>its</b> <b>trade</b> interests in India. Bonaparte wished to establish a French presence in the Middle East, with the ultimate dream of linking with Tipu Sultan, a Muslim enemy of the British in India.|$|E
5|$|On June 7, 2007, the Conservative {{government}} announced it had finalized free trade {{negotiations with the}} European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Under this agreement, Canada increased <b>its</b> <b>trade</b> ties with Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. In 2006, the value of trade between these partners was $10.7 billion. Canada had originally begun negotiations with the EFTA on October 9, 1998, but talks broke down because of a disagreement over subsidies to shipyards in Atlantic Canada.|$|E

5|$|A rising China {{has been}} {{increasingly}} interested in Central Asia and the Eurasian Economic Union. Analysts see the union {{as a potential}} way China could facilitate its investments in the region. Historically, China held close economic ties with many countries throughout Eurasia. Under the Han Dynasty, <b>its</b> <b>trade</b> routes extended to the Roman Empire. The Economy of the Han Dynasty and other subsequent dynasties exchanged numerous goods with countries throughout Europe and Asia. Both China and the union have stated they would benefit from recreating trade routes modelled on the historic Silk Road.|$|E
5|$|Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Healthcare Pty Ltd, (Baxter) was a {{decision}} of the High Court of Australia, which ruled on 29 August 2007 that Baxter Healthcare Proprietary Limited, a tenderer for various government contracts, was bound by the Trade Practices Act 1974 (TPA, Australian legislation governing anti-competitive behaviour) in <b>its</b> <b>trade</b> and commerce in tendering for government contracts. More generally, the case concerned the principles of derivative governmental immunity: whether the immunity of a government from a statute extends to third parties that conduct business with the government.|$|E

5|$|Ebla derived its {{prosperity}} from trade; its wealth {{was equal}} to that of the most important Sumerian cities, and its main commercial rival was Mari. Ebla's main articles of trade were probably timber from the nearby mountains, and textiles. Handicrafts also appear to have been a major export, evidenced by the quantity of artifacts recovered from the palaces of the city. Ebla possessed a wide commercial network reaching as far as modern-day Afghanistan. It shipped textiles to Cyprus, possibly through the port of Ugarit, but most of <b>its</b> <b>trade</b> seems to have been directed by river-boat towards Mesopotamia—chiefly Kish. The main palace G was found to contain artifacts dating from Ancient Egypt bearing the names of Pharaohs Khafra and Pepi I.|$|E
5|$|Either way, {{many of the}} {{countries}} involved in the crisis are on the euro, so devaluation, individual interest rates, and capital controls are not available. The only solution left to raise a country's level of saving is to reduce budget deficits and to change consumption and savings habits. For example, if a country's citizens saved more instead of consuming imports, this would reduce <b>its</b> <b>trade</b> deficit. It has therefore been suggested that countries with large trade deficits (e.g., Greece) consume less and improve their exporting industries.|$|E
5|$|In 1821, after {{tensions}} between the NWC and HBC had erupted into violence the NWC was forced to merge into the HBC. As a result, the HBC acquired the Columbia District and <b>its</b> <b>trade</b> with China. At first the system of shipping furs via the American Perkins and Company was continued, but in 1822 the United States Customs Service imposed a heavy ad valorem duty on the proceeds. The HBC stopped using American middlemen and instead tried selling furs through the EIC. In 1824 and 1825 the HBC sold 20,000 beaver and 7,000 land-otter skins in China through the EIC, but the arrangement did not prove advantageous for either firm.|$|E

5000|$|Gregory Laughlin, {{astrophysicist}} {{and department}} chairman at the University of California, Santa Cruz, researched Virtu's trading activity. In {{the debate about}} <b>its</b> near-perfect <b>trading</b> record, Virtu said that it wins 51 percent or 52 percent of <b>its</b> <b>trades,</b> leading most people to figure the remainder are losses. [...] In his research, Laughlin showed that [...] "the number of <b>its</b> <b>trades</b> that break even {{are about the same}} as its losses" [...] which means the HFT firm's per-trade losing percentage is only 24 instead of 48, indicating Virtu assumes little market risk.|$|R
5|$|In 1939, the United States had renounced <b>its</b> <b>trade</b> {{treaty with}} Japan; and, {{beginning}} with an aviation gasoline ban in July 1940, Japan became subject to increasing economic pressure. During this time, Japan launched its first attack against Changsha, a strategically important Chinese city, but was repulsed by late September. Despite several offensives by both sides, {{the war between}} China and Japan was stalemated by 1940. To increase pressure on China by blocking supply routes, and to better position Japanese forces {{in the event of}} a war with the Western powers, Japan invaded and occupied northern Indochina. Afterwards, the United States embargoed iron, steel and mechanical parts against Japan. Other sanctions soon followed.|$|E
5|$|Radioactive samarium-153 is a {{beta emitter}} with a {{half-life}} of 46.3 hours. It {{is used to}} kill cancer cells {{in the treatment of}} lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and osteosarcoma. For this purpose, samarium-153 is chelated with ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonate (EDTMP) and injected intravenously. The chelation prevents accumulation of radioactive samarium in the body that would result in excessive irradiation and generation of new cancer cells. The corresponding drug has several names including samarium (153Sm) lexidronam; <b>its</b> <b>trade</b> name is Quadramet.|$|E
5|$|Settlement in {{the region}} of Gaza dates back to Tell es-Sakan, an Ancient Egyptian {{fortress}} built in Canaanite territory to the south of present-day Gaza. The site went into decline throughout the Early Bronze Age II as <b>its</b> <b>trade</b> with Egypt sharply decreased. Another urban center known as Tell al-Ajjul began to grow along the Wadi Ghazza riverbed. During the Middle Bronze Age, a revived Tell es-Sakan became the southernmost locality in Palestine, serving as a fort. In 1650 BCE, when the Canaanite Hyksos occupied Egypt, a second city developed on the ruins of the first Tell as-Sakan. However, it was abandoned by the 14th century BCE, {{at the end of the}} Bronze Age.|$|E

5|$|All the same, between 1853 and the 1930s, fiscal {{instability}} was a transitory phenomenon. The depressions of 1873–77 and 1890–91 {{played a}} crucial role in fostering the rise of industry: timidly in the 1870s and more decisively in the 1890s, industry grew with each crisis in response to the need of a damaged economy to improve <b>its</b> <b>trade</b> balance through import-substitution. By 1914, about 15% the Argentine labour force was involved in manufacturing, compared to 20% involved in commercial activities. In 1913, the country's income per head was on a par with that of France and Germany, and far ahead of Italy's or Spain's. At the end of 1913, Argentina had a gold stock of £59 million, or 3.7% of the world's monetary gold, while representing 1.2% of the world's economic output.|$|E
5|$|In November 1808, a {{squadron}} of powerful French frigates sailed for Île de France under Commodore Jacques Hamelin. This squadron was under orders to attack and capture or destroy British shipping in the Indian Ocean, particularly the heavily armed convoys of East Indiamen that carried millions of pounds worth of trade goods from British India and the Far East to Britain. These convoys were operated by the Honourable East India Company (HEIC), which ran British India and maintained a private army and navy to secure the colony and <b>its</b> <b>trade</b> routes. During the late Napoleonic Wars, French naval strategy focused on the disruption of this trade {{with the use of}} fast and well-armed frigates to operate independently along British trade routes and capture British merchant ships. This affected the British economy, which was already severely stretched by the war, and forced the Royal Navy to divert resources to distant parts of the world to protect British trade.|$|E

5|$|Merchants {{organised}} {{themselves into}} powerful guilds that transcended political divisions, allowing their operations {{to be largely}} unaffected by wars and revolutions. Their only threat was the possibility of theft from brigands when their ships and caravans traveled to distant lands. Powerful South Indian merchant guilds included the Manigramam, the Nagarattar and the Anjuvannam. Local guilds were called nagaram, while the Nanadesis were traders from neighbouring kingdoms who perhaps mixed business with pleasure. The wealthiest and most influential and celebrated of all South Indian merchant guilds was the self-styled Ainnurruvar, {{also known as the}} 500 Svamis of Ayyavolepura (Brahmins and Mahajanas of present-day Aihole), who conducted extensive land and sea trade and thereby contributed significantly to the total foreign trade of the empire. It fiercely protected <b>its</b> <b>trade</b> obligations (Vira Bananjudharma or law of the noble merchants) and its members often recorded their achievements in inscriptions (prasasti). Five hundred such excavated Prasasti inscriptions, with their own flag and emblem, the bull, record their pride in their business.|$|E
5|$|Post-war {{development}} was different in southern Indiana. The state's commerce along the Ohio River was reduced during the war, {{especially after the}} closure of the Mississippi River to commercial trade with the South and increased competition from the state's expanding railroad network. Some of Indiana's river towns, such as Evansville, recovered by providing transport to Union troops across the Ohio River, but others did not. Before the war, New Albany was the largest city in the state, primarily due to its commerce with the South, but <b>its</b> <b>trade</b> dwindled during the war. After the war much of Indiana viewed New Albany as too friendly to the South. New Albany's formerly robust steamboat-building industry ended in 1870; the last steamboat built in New Albany was named the Robert E. Lee. New Albany never regained its pre-war stature; its population leveled off at 40,000, and only the antebellum, early-Victorian Mansion Row district remains from its boom period.|$|E
5|$|The British Empire was {{the largest}} on Earth, and Britain {{protected}} that empire and <b>its</b> <b>trade</b> routes with the world's largest navy. Great Britain {{assumed the role of}} peacekeeper on the world's oceans, and the Royal Navy was the instrument by which the Pax Britannica was kept. The global reach of the Royal Navy included the western Pacific Ocean, patrolled by the Australia Station. In 1887 Captain Henry Coey Kane took Calliope to the Pacific. At first assigned to the China Station, the vessel was reassigned to the Australia Station later in 1887. The cruiser was in New Zealand {{at the end of that}} year, and was the first vessel to enter the new Calliope Dock. In early 1888 Calliope was sent north to watch over a looming diplomatic crisis and potential military confrontation in Samoa.|$|E
