40|$|For {{buildings}} and constructions made by snow, like {{for example the}} ICEHOTEL in Jukkasjärvi, generally artificial snow is used. Both for safety reasons and for design purposes it is hence of importance to understand the material behaviour of artificial snow. Many {{buildings and}} structures made by snow and ice are constructed using knowledge obtained by experience. When subjected to a load snow undergoes an <b>immediate</b> <b>elastic</b> <b>deformation</b> and a time-dependent irreversible deformation, known as snow creep, which constitutes the considerably highest part of the total deformation. The magnitude of the snow creep deformation is the dominating deformation mechanism for snow structures but it is poorly investigated and not well understood. To study material parameters and mechanical behaviour of artificial snow unconfined compression test and deformation tests to observe the creep behaviour have been performed. Results from experimental tests have been analyzed and compared with theoretical calculations and finite element simulations. The density and viscosity have shown to be important parameters for the deformation behaviour and will have a direct influence on the creep rate. The investigation indicates that the artificial snow used for the tests have higher density, compression strength and creep strength compared to natural snow used in other studies.

40|$|ABSTRACT Creep is a {{phenomenon}} that can occur in wooden structures since wood is a viscoelastic material. Creep may change the purely elastic parameters determined in wood characterization initial tests, as its behavior depends on the rheology of the material, even under a constant stress level. Mathematically, creep can be characterized by models in which the <b>immediate</b> <b>elastic</b> <b>deformation</b> is increased by a viscous deformation, resulting in a temporal function. For this reason, the calculation of the natural frequency of vibration and the stability verification of a slender column should include the reducing effects of stiffness both of axial force and creep. The first one can be considered through the geometrical portion and the second one by the introduction, in the conventional portion, of a variable elasticity modulus over time, obtained {{in relation to the}} adopted rheological model. A numerical simulation was performed to evaluate the aspects above, considering a bar compressed by a force at the free end equivalent to 10 % of the Euler critical force, plus its own weight, adopting a rheological model with three parameters for the variation of the elasticity modulus. The results show differences of 60 % and 50 % for the frequency and elasticity modulus, besides defining the exact instant of column collapse in the case of its non-observance...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to <b>immediate</b> <b>elastic</b> <b>deformations,</b> concrete undergoes time-dependent deformations {{that must be}} considered in design. Creep is defined as the time-dependent deformation resulting from a sustained stress. Shrinkage deformation is the time-dependent strain that occurs {{in the absence of an}} applied load. The total strain of a concrete specimen is the sum of elastic, creep, and shrinkage strains. Several test beams for the Pinner’s Point Bridge have been produced by Bayshore Concrete Products Corp., in Cape Charles, VA. These beams feature high strength concrete mix designs with specified 28 -day compressive strengths of 55. 2 MPa (8, 000 psi) and 69. 0 MPa (10, 000 psi). These test beams were equipped with thermocouples to track interior concrete temperatures, and vibrating wire gages placed at the center of prestressing to record changes in strain. Laboratory creep and shrinkage testing was conducted on specimens prepared with identical materials and similar mixture proportions to those used at Bayshore. The temperature profile from the test beams during steam curing was used to produce match-cured specimens for laboratory testing. Two match cure batches were produced, along with two standard cur...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Dynamic {{pressure}} {{oil film}} bearing {{is an important}} mechanical component of the ship. With the development of large-sized ships, their dynamic pressure oil films often run at high speed and under heavy load generating high oil film pressure. In addition, due to {{the increased use of}} thin walled bearing shell with materials of low elastic modulus, the <b>elastic</b> <b>deformation</b> of the bearing shell which is in dynamic pressure oil film bearing cannot be ignored. During computation, if the effect of <b>elastic</b> <b>deformation</b> on the performance of dynamic pressure oil film bearing is ignored as is usually the practise, the difference between the theoretical and the actual results will be enormous. Therefore, this article took the effect of bearing shell's <b>elastic</b> <b>deformation</b> on bearing performance as the research target.
