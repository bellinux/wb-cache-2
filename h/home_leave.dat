5|$|While {{traveling}} in Mexico, Scripps met María Pilar Arellanos, of Cancún, and married her in 1980. They travelled together {{for two years}} until 1982, when {{he was sentenced to}} a three-year jail term for theft, burglary and resisting arrest. His imprisonment upset María, and their relationship was further soured when he ran away from jail during <b>home</b> <b>leave</b> in June 1985—just months short of completing his term—and burgled again. He was sentenced to another three years' imprisonment, during which she filed for divorce and married Police Constable Ken Cold, an officer in the Royal Protection Squad. This angered Scripps, who acted in revenge, stealing some of Cold's clothing while released on <b>home</b> <b>leave.</b> He was appeased only when she divorced her new husband and returned to her hometown. After he was released, Scripps legally changed his name to John Martin.|$|E
5|$|Following his 83rd aerial victory, Müncheberg {{was summoned}} to his {{commanding}} officer, Geschwaderkommodore Schöpfel, who informed him of his transfer to Jagdgeschwader 51 (JG51—51st Fighter Wing) on the Eastern Front. Müncheberg was destined to become a Geschwaderkommodore but prior to receiving his own command {{he would have to}} serve as a Kommodore in training. He went on a three weeks <b>home</b> <b>leave,</b> staying at his parents home, before he received his orders to head east on 21 July 1942.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{presentation}} of the Swords, Philipp went on <b>home</b> <b>leave.</b> Again he was asked to make a number of propaganda appearances. On 1 May 1942, he spoke before his home school and before the Meissen youth at the Hamburger Hof. He, his mother and his fiancée were also invited to Meissen Town Hall on 30 April. Among other officials, present were the NSDAP-Kreisleiter (county leader) Helmut Böhme and the mayor of Meissen, Walter Kaule. Philipp was granted the privilege of signing the Meissen Golden Book (Goldenes Buch)—a book signed in German communities and cities by special guests of honor.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{three major}} issues: whether predictors of <b>home</b> <b>leaving</b> differ by age at <b>home</b> <b>leaving,</b> whether predictors differ by {{first time and}} last time <b>home</b> <b>leaving,</b> and what variables best predict repeated <b>home</b> <b>leaving.</b> The 1988 National Survey of Families and Households provides the data set from which respondents age 30 and below are selected. Discriminant analysis and event history are the major methods by which these issues are addressed. Four major categories of variables {{are included in the}} analysis: family structure, family formation, personal characteristics, and control variables. Respondents are divided into three groups according to their ages at first time and last time home leaving: early home leavers (left at age 17 and below), on-time home leavers (left between 18 and 24), and late home leavers (left at 25 and above). ^ It is found that predictors of <b>home</b> <b>leaving</b> differ according to the group of home leavers under study. Growing up in a non-nuclear household (adoptive, stepfamily, or other) generally affects early <b>home</b> <b>leaving.</b> Single-parent families are associated with on-time <b>home</b> <b>leaving.</b> When early marriage is controlled, marital status emerges as a better predictor of late than on-time <b>home</b> <b>leaving.</b> ^ The predictors of <b>home</b> <b>leaving</b> vary little by whether we look at first time or last time <b>home</b> <b>leaving.</b> The effect of family structure is significant but very similar in both cases. The observable changes are largely associated with parenthood, divorce/separation status, and personal income. ^ Repeated <b>home</b> <b>leaving</b> is best predicted by respondents 2 ̆ 7 age at first <b>home</b> <b>leaving,</b> race, and divorce/separation status. Children from non-biological or non-intact families are less likely to repeat <b>home</b> <b>leaving.</b> In {{spite of the fact that}} the previous literature suggests a high home return rate for those who once lived in barracks or dormitories, military service and student status fail to predict repeated <b>home</b> <b>leaving.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|In this {{exploratory}} study, we profile {{variations in}} <b>home</b> <b>leaving,</b> <b>home</b> returning, and home staying behaviour among four ethnocultural groups in Canada - British, Chinese, Indian, and South European. Data {{collected in a}} 1999 - 2000 survey of 1, 907 young adults (ages 19 - 35) residing in the Vancouver area are used. Our principal foci are ethnocultural and gendered aspects of <b>home</b> <b>leaving</b> trajectories, specifically: ages at <b>home</b> <b>leaving</b> and returning, and reasons for <b>home</b> <b>leaving,</b> <b>home</b> returning and home staying. Special {{attention is paid to}} returners/boomerangers, given an increasing overall trend in home returning in Canada. We find that: (a) both ethnocultural origin and gender are important determinants of <b>home</b> <b>leaving</b> trajectory, (b) there is a distinct (but far from tidy) difference between European-origin and Asian-origin groups in <b>home</b> <b>leaving</b> trajectory, (c) British-Canadians <b>leave</b> <b>home</b> at the youngest ages and Indo-Canadians at the oldest ages, (d) the main reason for <b>home</b> <b>leaving</b> is independence for British-Canadians; schooling for Chinese-Canadians, and marriage for Indo-Canadians, (e) among all four groups, <b>home</b> returners <b>leave</b> <b>home</b> initially at younger ages and, with the exception of Indo-Canadian young men, who typically <b>leave</b> <b>home</b> for school, and (f) gender differences in <b>home</b> <b>leaving</b> trajectory are larger among the Chinese and Indo-Canadians than among persons of European origins. Overall, we conclude that the theorized trend of the individualized family life course holds for only some ethnocultural groups in Canada. We conclude with suggestions for future research directions on the topic of ethnicity and the <b>home</b> <b>leaving</b> life course transitions...|$|R

5|$|Following {{that the}} Allied {{offensive}} continued {{for the next}} four months, right up {{until the end of the}} war. During the Second Battle of the Somme the Australian Corps fought actions at Lihons, Etinehem, Proyart, Chuignes, and Mont St Quentin, before taking part in their final engagement of the war on 5 October 1918 at Montbrehain. Australian casualties during these battles were very high and coupled with the drying up of reinforcements from Australia, the rejection of the proposal to introduce conscription and the granting of <b>home</b> <b>leave</b> to men who been serving since 1914 meant that by the end of the war the AIF was severely stretched to the limit. Consequently, during the height of the offensive it was decided to disband three battalions—the 36th, 47th and 52nd—in order to reinforce other units.|$|E
5|$|From March to September 1937, Lützow, now an Oberleutnant (first lieutenant), claimed five victories, {{including}} the first ever recorded claim by a Messerschmitt Bf 109 pilot. Flying a Bf109B, he shot down an Polikarpov I-15, a Soviet built biplane fighter aircraft, on 6 April 1937. On 26 April 1937, air elements of the Condor Legion targeted and bombed Guernica, an attack which has been characterised as a war crime by Wette and Ueberschär, but Lützow {{did not participate in}} the attack as he was on <b>home</b> <b>leave</b> from 8–29 April 1937. After he returned, Lützow claimed three more I-15s shot down, one on 22 May, another on 28 May, and his last on 18 August 1937. His final aerial victory in Spain was over a Polikarpov I-16, a monoplane fighter aircraft, which he shot down on 22 August 1937.|$|E
5|$|In July, British {{forces were}} sent from India {{to relieve the}} Australian troops in Ceylon. Preparations were made for the 2/3rd Battalion to return to Australia, and after embarking upon the SS Westernland, they arrived in Melbourne on 8 August 1942, having {{returned}} via the southern route away from the Japanese submarines patrolling the east coast. After this, the troops all received two weeks <b>home</b> <b>leave,</b> staggered {{from the time of}} their arrival. The final group had their leave cut short after only three days, however, when they were recalled by urgent telegram. The 16th Brigade was again on the move, this time to Port Moresby in New Guinea, where the fighting against the Japanese along the Kokoda Track was reaching a critical stage. After a short voyage, the brigade arrived at Port Moresby on 21 September 1942.|$|E
40|$|The {{decision}} {{to remain in}} or <b>leave</b> the parental <b>home</b> represents the first housing career choice of young people. In this paper, we examine the parental <b>home</b> <b>leaving</b> outcomes for Australian birth cohorts {{in the twentieth century}} using recall questions contained in the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey. The findings from survival analysis and hazard function modelling is that a continuous, gradual reduction in the age of first <b>leaving</b> the parental <b>home</b> in Australia is evident up to the 1947 - 51 birth cohort, followed by stability and then a rise in age of first <b>leaving</b> <b>home</b> for the most recent birth cohorts. Birth cohort effects remain significant even after other measured determinants of parental <b>home</b> <b>leaving</b> are taken into account. The paper confirms the strong roles that education, family background, and ethnicity have on parental <b>home</b> <b>leaving</b> outcomes...|$|R

5|$|In November 1940, Von Müllenheim-Rechberg {{was sent}} to the Naval Gunnery School at Wik to {{complete}} his heavy gun training courses, which ended his position as Lindemann's personal adjutant. Lindemann's new adjutant was the signals officer Second Lieutenant Wolfgang Reiner. Bismarcks heavy guns were first test-fired {{in the second half of}} November, and Bismarck was shown to be a very stable gun platform. After the 1940 Christmas celebration on board, Lindemann and the majority of the officers, non-commissioned officers and sailors went on <b>home</b> <b>leave.</b> First gunnery officer Lieutenant Commander Adalbert Schneider relieved Lindemann as Bismarcks commander during his absence. Lindemann spent his leave with his wife and daughter and returned on 1 January 1941.|$|E
5|$|On 23 June 1940, I. Gruppe {{was moved}} to a forward {{airfield}} at Grandvilliers in preparation for missions over the Channel Coast, but the following day, all Bf109s were sent to Wiesbaden, via Brussels, for a thorough maintenance check. The overhaul detachment arrived in Wiesbaden {{in the late afternoon}} and the pilots were sent on <b>home</b> <b>leave.</b> The cease-fire of the Armistice of 22 June 1940 went into effect on 25 June 1940, ending the Battle of France. During the French campaign, Lützow flew 64 combat missions and claimed nine victories. Under his leadership, I. Gruppe {{was one of the most}} successful units in this campaign. It was credited with 88 aerial victories for the loss of six pilots killed and ten Bf109s destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Scripps began {{trafficking}} in drugs, and carried heroin between Asia and Europe for a syndicate. Singapore authorities first encountered {{his name in}} 1987, {{when he was arrested}} at Heathrow Airport for possessing drugs. Police found a key on him that belonged to a safe deposit box in a bank in Orchard Road in Singapore, from which officers from Singapore's Central Narcotics Bureau seized 1.5kilogrammes (3.3lb) of heroin worth about US$1 million. For this and another drug offence, Southwark Crown Court in January 1988 sentenced him to seven years in jail. He escaped while on <b>home</b> <b>leave</b> but was later re-arrested. In July 1992, Winchester Crown Court added another six years to the original sentence, which would have kept him behind bars until 2001 had he not escaped again.|$|E

5|$|The German air {{offensive}} against England was a failure, and only resulted in heavy losses. To replenish these, II./JG54 was {{withdrawn from the}} Channel Front on 3 December 1940 and stationed at Delmenhorst. The pilots were sent on a ski vacation at Kitzbühl and given <b>home</b> <b>leave.</b> Philipp made a public propaganda appearance at his Franziskaneum home school on 16 December, speaking of his actions as fighter pilot. On 15 January 1941, his unit was moved to Le Mans, southwest of Paris, to protect the airspace over Normandy. Here they stayed until 29 March 1941 when they were ordered to Graz {{in preparation for the}} attack on Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|A {{short period}} of <b>home</b> <b>leave</b> followed, before the battalion's {{personnel}} concentrated at Royal Park for a march through Melbourne. A draft of reinforcements arrived around this time also, incorporating men from New South Wales and several others states. In mid-September, the battalion moved to Greta, New South Wales, travelling by rail through Shepparton, Tocumwal and Newcastle. A brief period of training was undertaken there, during which the battalion's khaki uniforms were dyed green. During this time, the battalion was re-organised and converted to the jungle establishment; {{as part of this}} process its authorised strength was reduced to around 800 personnel of all ranks. The situation in the Pacific had deteriorated dramatically, and the Australian forces holding out against the Japanese in New Guinea were hard-pressed and desperately in need of reinforcement. Thus in early October 1942, not more than two months after returning to Australia, the 2/5th moved to Brisbane, Queensland, where it deployed to Milne Bay, which had only recently been held {{in the face of a}} Japanese landing, aboard the Dutch transport Maetsuyker.|$|E
5|$|Concentrating at Wondecla, on the Atherton Tablelands {{in north}} Queensland, after an {{extended}} period of <b>home</b> <b>leave</b> during which time the Victorian and South Australian personnel took part in a march through Melbourne, the 2/5th Battalion spent the next year training on the Tablelands {{along with the rest of}} the 6th Division. There was also a large turn over in the battalion's personnel at this time, as it had been severely depleted due to illness during its previous campaign, and it was brought up to strength by April 1944 with several drafts of reinforcements, with the majority coming from New South Wales. To counter boredom and malaise amongst the men during late 1944, the battalion was occupied with a series of various sporting events and further leave. In the new year, a series of amphibious exercises were undertaken during this time with a view to preparing the battalion for future operations.|$|E

5|$|Embarking on the Mt Vernon in Port Tewfik, the {{battalion}} sailed from Egypt in early February and arrived in Adelaide, South Australia, in mid-March. After this, {{the battalion}} camped at Woodside, in the Adelaide Hills, where {{a period of}} re-conditioning and exercises followed until mid-April when {{the majority of its}} personnel were sent on <b>home</b> <b>leave.</b> At the end of the month, those that remained undertook a five-day train journey to Casino, New South Wales. Limited training was undertaken until mid-May, around which time orders were received for another move, this time to Caboolture, Queensland. By the end of the month, the battalion returned to almost full strength when the final leave draft returned. At the time, the strategic situation in the Pacific was in the balance; the Japanese were advancing south and due to concerns about a possible Japanese invasion, the 25th Brigade was tasked with defending the coastal area north of Brisbane.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the capture}} of Sattelberg, the 2/48th {{continued}} the advance north {{along with the rest}} of the 26th Brigade, pushing on over difficult terrain to Wareo, where they arrived on 8 December. Following this, the Japanese began to fall back to Sio in retreat and the battalion's involvement in combat operations on the peninsula came to an end as troops from the 5th Division arrived to relieve them. In January, the battalion camped around the Dallman River before being withdrawn back to Finschhafen, camping around the Song River. In February 1944, the 2/48th was withdrawn back to Australia along with the 9th Division. Sailing aboard an American Liberty ship, the battalion landed in Brisbane on 20 February, and made camp at Kalinga before personnel marched out for a long period of <b>home</b> <b>leave.</b> During its time in New Guinea, the battalion had suffered 125 casualties, of which 36 were killed, three died of wounds, eight died of illness and 77 were wounded.|$|E
5|$|Following this, the battalions of the Australian Corps {{were removed}} from the line for rest on 5 October, after a request from the Australian prime minister, Billy Hughes. They had been {{severely}} depleted and were suffering from acute manpower shortages {{as a result of the}} combination of a decrease in the number of volunteers from Australia and the decision to grant <b>home</b> <b>leave</b> to men who had served for over four years. Subsequently, when the armistice was signed on 11 November 1918, the Australian Corps had not returned to the front and was still in the rear reorganising and training. With the end of hostilities the demobilisation process began, and men were slowly repatriated back to Australia. The process took a considerable period of time, though, and a large number of men were able to undertake tertiary and vocational training in England and France to prepare for their return to civilian life. Finally, as numbers dwindled, the battalion was disbanded on 4 June 1919.|$|E

On 9 September, {{he was awarded the}} Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords following his 103rd victory. Müncheberg was the 19th member of the Wehrmacht and the 13th fighter pilot who had received this award. Müncheberg claimed his last victory in this theatre on 22 September 1942, claiming 33 victories in total over Russian aircraft, this took his overall score to 116 aerial victories. He was then ordered to the Wolf's Lair where Hitler presented him the Swords to his Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves. Following the award ceremony he was granted <b>home</b> <b>leave</b> before being appointed Geschwaderkommodore of Jagdgeschwader 77 (JG77—77th Fighter Wing), replacing Gordon Gollob in this role.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Nowotny {{increased}} his tally of victories and claimed his 30th and 31st kills on 11July over the Wolchow bridgehead, which {{earned him the}} Luftwaffe Honor Goblet on 14July1942. Nowotny shot down a further five aircraft on a single day (32nd – 36th victories) on 20July and seven (48th – 54th victories) on 2August. After having downed three enemy aircraft on 11August, Leutnant Nowotny carried out three victory passes over the airfield, despite having sustained combat damage to his own Bf 109"Black 1". In the subsequent landing, his aircraft somersaulted and he sustained moderate injuries. Walter Nowotny was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 4September, after 56aerial victories. The Knight's Cross earned him a <b>home</b> <b>leave</b> to Vienna. Here, the brothers Hubert and Walter met {{for the last time}} before Hubert was killed at Stalingrad. Leutnant Nowotny was made Staffelkapitän of 1./JG 54 on 25October, replacing Oberleutnant Heinz Lange.|$|E

From there, the battalion travelled overland to Sydney where they embarked upon the SS Ile de France from Pyrmont Wharf, bound for the Middle East, {{as part of a}} large convoy of troopships. Sailing via Fremantle where 'D' Company rejoined the battalion, they sailed on to Colombo, which was reached in late April, where the troopship put in for repairs and shore leave was given to all battalion personnel. Departing again in early May, they continued on alone, crossing the Red Sea in a week and making landfall at Port Tewfik.
