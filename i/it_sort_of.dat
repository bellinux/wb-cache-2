John Kenneth Muir raised several of these issues in his book, Horror Films of the 1970s: [...] "How does Kathy's dad know Craig, the government agent?

Outside, there were few lights on and the stars in the sky were visible and [...] "just amazing", according to the song's co-producer, Ken Nelson. He told the band to look at the stars, which they did. Lead singer Chris Martin was inspired by the sight and the song's main melody, consisting of a chord pattern, popped into his head. At first, Martin did not take it seriously [...] "as he relayed the tune {{to the rest of the}} band in his worst Neil Young impersonation voice". Martin has said, [...] "The song had the word 'stars' and that seemed like a word you should sing in a Neil Young voice."

When developing the screenplay, Munroe wanted to take on a less lighthearted tone or [...] "less Cowabunga" [...] and place an emphasis on dark elements as shown in the original comics to appeal to the mature audience. [...] "I had a very specific tone because mixing that sort of action and comedy is a very specific thing. Most people were just coming and wanting to make it too funny.

[...] Munroe said that in design and in the rendering of the animation, he was after the feel of a comic book.

500|$|... "At Long Last Leave", {{which is}} the 500th episode of The Simpsons, was written by Michael Price. The Simpsons showrunner Al Jean has {{described}} it as [...] "a tribute to people who love the show." [...] Being a fan of musical theater, Price titled the episode {{in reference to the}} Cole Porter song [...] "At Long Last Love". Price did not write [...] "At Long Last Leave" [...] with the intention of it becoming the 500th episode; that decision was made afterwards when the staff members realized the story offered an opportunity for a look-back at the history of the Simpson family. He {{said in an interview with}} the magazine Channel Guide that he was [...] "deeply honored" [...] when his episode was selected for the milestone. As acknowledged by Price in that interview, the plot of the episode features similarities to the 2007 film The Simpsons Movie, in which the Simpsons are forced to flee to Alaska after Homer angers the townspeople in Springfield by polluting a lake. However, Price commented that [...] "I think it's different from the movie in that <b>it</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> does reference back the entire history of the show, the collective experience of Springfield vis-a-vis the Simpsons, whereas the movie they were forced to run away due to that very specific thing". He further noted that despite the similarities [...] "we [...] liked it enough to go with it anyway."

500|$|At {{this point}} in the development, the {{backdrop}} of Rapture had been fleshed out, but they had yet to come on how to represent the drones, protectors, and harvesters from their original game idea. The Big Daddy concept as the protector class was developed early in the process, but the team had yet to reach a satisfying design for the drones, having used several possible designs including bugs and dogs in wheelchairs. The team wanted to have the player care for the drones in some way and create pathos for these characters. The idea of using little girls came out of brainstorming, but was controversial and shocking within the team at first, recognizing that they could easily be killed and make the game more horrific in the style of Night Trap. However, as Levine worked on the story, he started to incorporate the ideas of dystopian and utopian thinkers from the twentieth century, including Ayn Rand, Aldous Huxley, and George Orwell, and considered their ideas [...] "fascinating". He brought in the ideas of Objectivism that Rand primarily outlined in the book Atlas Shrugged, that man should be driven by selfishness and not altruism, and used this to inform the philosophy behind the city of Rapture and Andrew Ryan’s work, tied in with his previous observations on Rockefeller and his writings. This was extended {{to the use of the}} little girls as drones (now Little Sisters), particularly the question whether the player should try to save the girls or harvest the ADAM for their own benefit. 2K Games expressed concern about the initial mechanic of the Little Sisters, where the player would actively prey on the Little Sister, which would have alerted a Big Daddy and setting up the fight with the player. This approach did not sit well with Levine, and 2K Games asserted that they would not ship a game [...] "where the player gets punished for doing the right thing". They altered this approach where the Little Sisters would be invulnerable until the player had dealt with their Big Daddy, though LeBreton considered this [...] "a massive kludge" [...] into the game's fiction. The idea of creating the Little Sisters and presenting the player with this choice became a critical part of the game's appeal to the larger gaming market though would still be met with criticism from some outlets. Levine desired only to have one ending to the game, something that would have left the fate of the characters [...] "much more ambiguous", but publisher pressure directed them to craft multiple endings depending on the choice of harvesting Little Sisters. Levine also noted that [...] "it was never my intention to do two endings for the game. <b>It</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> came very late and it was something that was requested by somebody up the food chain from me." ...|$|E
