50|$|The four-drive <b>example</b> <b>is</b> {{identical}} {{to a standard}} RAID 1+0 array, while the three-drive <b>example</b> <b>is</b> a software implementation of RAID 1E. The two-drive <b>example</b> <b>is</b> equivalent to RAID 1.|$|R
3000|$|... [...]. The {{following}} theorem and <b>example</b> <b>were</b> {{given in}} [7]. In fact, the <b>example</b> <b>is</b> to illustrate Theorem  2.1.|$|R
30|$|The {{source of}} the <b>example</b> <b>is</b> [URL] Accessed 3 May 2018. This <b>example</b> <b>was</b> the title of an online article.|$|R
5|$|An enzyme's name {{is often}} derived from its {{substrate}} or the chemical reaction it catalyzes, {{with the word}} ending in -ase. <b>Examples</b> <b>are</b> lactase, alcohol dehydrogenase and DNA polymerase. Different enzymes that catalyze the same chemical reaction are called isozymes.|$|E
5|$|Chemistry {{makes use}} of {{matrices}} in various ways, particularly since the use of quantum theory to discuss molecular bonding and spectroscopy. <b>Examples</b> <b>are</b> the overlap matrix and the Fock matrix used in solving the Roothaan equations to obtain the molecular orbitals of the Hartree–Fock method.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, geologists have {{confirmed}} {{that a number of}} seamounts are active undersea volcanoes; two <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> Lo‘ihi in the Hawaiian Islands and Vailulu'u in the Manu'a Group (Samoa).|$|E
5000|$|Curry - The basic Indian {{vegetable}} or meat gravy. It is now {{ubiquitous in}} local Chinese and Malay 'traditional' cuisine. A Peranakan <b>example</b> <b>is</b> Laksa, whose name {{derives from the}} Sanskrit for 'hundred thousand'. A Eurasian <b>example</b> <b>is</b> Devil curry, while a Chinese <b>example</b> <b>is</b> Chilli crab.|$|R
50|$|By this definition, {{the margin}} is {{positive}} if the <b>example</b> <b>is</b> labeled correctly and negative if the <b>example</b> <b>is</b> labeled incorrectly.|$|R
30|$|A {{numerical}} testing <b>example</b> <b>is</b> {{employed to}} test the proposed algorithm. The <b>example</b> <b>is</b> an underground tunnel with a radius of 3  m. The details of this <b>example</b> can <b>be</b> found in reference (Gao 2016).|$|R

5|$|Long-acting {{compounds}} have a half-life of 40–250 hours. They have {{a risk of}} accumulation in {{the elderly}} and in individuals with severely impaired liver function, {{but they have a}} reduced severity of rebound effects and withdrawal. <b>Examples</b> <b>are</b> diazepam, clorazepate, chlordiazepoxide, and flurazepam.|$|E
5|$|Mild iron {{deficiency}} {{can be prevented}} or corrected by eating iron-rich foods and by cooking in an iron skillet. Because iron is a requirement for most plants and animals, {{a wide range of}} foods provide iron. Good sources of dietary iron have heme-iron, as this is most easily absorbed and is not inhibited by medication or other dietary components. Three <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> red meat, poultry, and insects. Non-heme sources do contain iron, though it has reduced bioavailability. <b>Examples</b> <b>are</b> lentils, beans, leafy vegetables, pistachios, tofu, fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals.|$|E
30|$|We {{note that}} E(G) {{in the above}} <b>example</b> <b>is</b> not convex in C × C, while E(G) in the {{following}} <b>example</b> <b>is</b> convex.|$|R
50|$|A simple SLIMbus Component <b>example</b> <b>is</b> {{shown in}} Figure 1 below, and a complex SLIMbus Component <b>example</b> <b>is</b> shown in Figure 2 below.|$|R
25|$|Only 5 <b>examples</b> <b>were</b> {{thought to}} remain, all at former RAF Hornchurch, but two well-preserved <b>examples</b> <b>were</b> rediscovered in 2014 in Docking in North Norfolk.|$|R
5|$|Notes: Two {{varieties}} exist. One variety depicts rays {{between the}} sword and leg, {{while the other}} does not. <b>Examples</b> <b>are</b> {{known to have been}} struck in white metal.|$|E
5|$|Ruthenium forms {{a variety}} of {{coordination}} complexes. <b>Examples</b> <b>are</b> the many pentammine derivatives n+ that often exist for both Ru(II) and Ru(III). Derivatives of bipyridine and terpyridine are numerous, best known being the luminescent tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) chloride.|$|E
5|$|Secondary structure: {{regularly}} repeating local structures stabilized by hydrogen bonds. The {{most common}} <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> the α-helix, β-sheet and turns. Because secondary structures are local, many regions of different secondary structure can {{be present in}} the same protein molecule.|$|E
30|$|In this section, a {{numerical}} <b>example</b> <b>is</b> given {{to illustrate the}} above solution procedure. The solutions to this <b>example</b> <b>is</b> obtained using the computer MatLab software.|$|R
50|$|The NF110 was a {{diesel-electric}} locomotive built by General Motors Diesel for narrow gauge service with the Canadian National Railways in Newfoundland (see: Newfoundland Railway). Only nine <b>examples</b> <b>were</b> built between 1952 and 1953, although thirty-eight identical NF210 were later built. The last <b>examples</b> <b>were</b> retired in 1986 and afterwards three <b>examples</b> <b>were</b> preserved in non-operating condition, all located in Newfoundland.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>example</b> <b>is</b> also in conjunctive {{normal form}} and the last two are in both {{conjunctive normal form}} and {{disjunctive}} normal form, but the second <b>example</b> <b>is</b> in neither.|$|R
5|$|Short-acting {{compounds}} have {{a median}} half-life of 1–12 hours. They have few residual effects if taken before bedtime, rebound insomnia may occur upon discontinuation, {{and they might}} cause daytime withdrawal symptoms such as next day rebound anxiety with prolonged usage. <b>Examples</b> <b>are</b> brotizolam, midazolam, and triazolam.|$|E
5|$|The {{confusion}} {{continued until}} the end of the 19th century when artists began to use photography as an aid to painting. Notable <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> Peder Severin Krøyer, Jens Ferdinand Willumsen and Laurits Andersen Ring who used photography to obtain more detail and realism in their paintings.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} such fossil is the reputed bilaterian Vernanimalcula {{claimed by}} some, however, {{to represent the}} infilling of an egg-sac or acritarch. Later <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> almost universally accepted as bilaterians and include the mollusc-like Kimberella, Spriggina (pictured) and the shield-shaped Parvancorina whose affinities are currently debated.|$|E
50|$|A single used {{on cover}} <b>example</b> <b>is</b> known, which {{was sent by}} the then Prince of Wales, later King George V, to himself. This <b>example</b> <b>is</b> in the Royal Philatelic Collection.|$|R
5000|$|A {{particularly}} interesting <b>example</b> <b>is</b> when [...] is a Riemannian symmetric space, for example hyperbolic space. The simplest such <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the hyperbolic plane, whose isometry group is isomorphic to [...]|$|R
50|$|The parent metallacyclobutane has {{the formula}} LnM(CH2)3 where L is a ligand {{attached}} to M. A stable <b>example</b> <b>is</b> (PPh3)2Pt(CH2)3. The first <b>example</b> <b>was</b> prepared by oxidative addition of cyclopropane to platinum.|$|R
5|$|There are {{alternatives}} to general relativity built upon the same premises, which include additional rules and/or constraints, leading to different field equations. <b>Examples</b> <b>are</b> Brans–Dicke theory, teleparallelism, f(R) gravity and Einstein–Cartan theory.|$|E
5|$|There {{have also}} {{been a number of}} {{translations}} which aim to present the Gododdin as literature rather than as a subject of scholarly study. <b>Examples</b> <b>are</b> the translation by Joseph P. Clancy in The earliest Welsh poetry (1970) and Steve Short's 1994 translation.|$|E
5|$|Adjacent to {{the smaller}} Biblical scenes and {{supported}} by the Ignudi are ten circular parade shields, sometimes described as being painted to resemble bronze. Known <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> actually of lacquered and gilt wood. Each is decorated with a picture drawn from the Old Testament or the Book of Maccabees from the Apocrypha.|$|E
5000|$|A Latin <b>example</b> <b>is</b> [...] "O tempora! O mores!" [...] ("Oh, the times! Oh, the morals!"). A modern <b>example</b> <b>is</b> [...] "Young man!" [...] {{from the}} song YMCA by the Village People.|$|R
5000|$|Electron transfer. An <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the {{decomposition}} of certain peresters by Cu(I) {{which is a}} one-electron reduction reaction forming Cu(II), an alkoxy oxygen radical and a carboxylate. Another <b>example</b> <b>is</b> Kolbe electrolysis.|$|R
50|$|Depending on the rules, the {{patterns}} {{can be extremely}} varied and unpredictable. One of the more well-known <b>examples</b> <b>is</b> Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton. Another <b>example</b> <b>is</b> Boids. More <b>examples</b> can <b>be</b> found in generative music, generative art, and, more recently, in video games such as Spore.|$|R
