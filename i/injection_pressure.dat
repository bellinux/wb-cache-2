5|$|Injection {{moulding}} machines {{consist of}} a material hopper, an injection ram or screw-type plunger, and a heating unit. Also known as platens, they hold the moulds in which the components are shaped. Presses are rated by tonnage, which expresses the amount of clamping force that the machine can exert. This force keeps the mould closed during the injection process. Tonnage can vary from less than 5 tons to over 9,000 tons, with the higher figures used in comparatively few manufacturing operations. The total clamp force needed {{is determined by the}} projected area of the part being moulded. This projected area is multiplied by a clamp force of from 1.8 to 7.2 tons for each square centimetre of the projected areas. As a rule of thumb, 4 or 5 tons/in2 can be used for most products. If the plastic material is very stiff, it will require more <b>injection</b> <b>pressure</b> to fill the mould, and thus more clamp tonnage to hold the mould closed. The required force can also be determined by the material used {{and the size of the}} part. Larger parts require higher clamping force.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{numerical}} {{and experimental}} investigations {{have been carried}} out to delineate the effect of various spray parameters on CO and NOx emissions in a combustor operating in flameless combustion mode with kerosene fuel. Thermal input was varied in the range of 20 - 41 kW (Heat release density similar to 5 - 10 MW/m(3)) with different fuel injectors and various fuel <b>injection</b> <b>pressures.</b> Spray parameters were varied by employing two separate conditions (i) same fuel flow rate with different solid cone pressure swirl spray nozzles (N 1 - N 4) and <b>injection</b> <b>pressures</b> (2. 5 - 14 bar) to achieve varying spray parameters at same thermal input (ii) same fuel injection nozzle at different fuel flow rates and <b>injection</b> <b>pressures</b> (5 - 13 bar) to understand their effect on combustion and emissions. In both the cases, Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) varied in the range of 34 - 58 mu m with spray cone angle varying from 42 degrees to 56 degrees using different nozzles and fuel <b>injection</b> <b>pressures.</b> Tangential air <b>injection</b> helped achieve higher recirculation of hot combustion products in the primary zone of the combustor for all thermal inputs. The finer sprays obtained at higher <b>injection</b> <b>pressures</b> helped achieve improved recirculation and better mixing, resulting in uniform temperature and hence reduced CO and NOx emissions. The measured CO and NOx emissions were in the range of 28 - 70 ppm and 2 - 10 ppm for all heat inputs with global equivalence ratio varying from phi = 0. 6 to 1, respectively. Measured acoustic emission levels were in the range of 98 - 101 dB and 104 - 107 dB for the flameless and transition mode respectively. The measured CO, NOx and acoustic emissions are an order of magnitude smaller those corresponding to conventional combustion mode. It was observed that coarser sprays led to a significant increase in acoustic emissions, relatively non-uniform temperature distribution and higher CO, NOx emissions during flameless combustion mode.

These polyamide materials differ from other thermoplastics in two main areas:One: Viscosity: At processing temperature (410F/210C) the viscosity is very low, typically around 3,000 centipoise (similar to pancake syrup). Low viscosity materials require low <b>injection</b> <b>pressure</b> in order to inject into a cavity. In fact it is normal to use a simple gear pump to inject the polyamide material.

The model capabilities are firstly tested comparing the numerical results with four sets of experimental literature data, characterized by low <b>injection</b> <b>pressures.</b> The high <b>injection</b> <b>pressures</b> of modern Diesel engines result in droplets velocities emerging from the nozzle greater than 300 m/s. To better understand the models behavior with high <b>injection</b> <b>pressures,</b> an experimental investigation of the splash behavior of a Diesel spray emerging from a Common Rail (CR) injection apparatus, with <b>injection</b> <b>pressures</b> up to 120 MPa, is carried out.
