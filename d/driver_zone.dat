40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the growing amount of Neptunium {{produced}} in reactors, Russia and France are currently investigating the possibility of using fast reactors to burn Neptuniuml, 2, 3. The BFS 67 experimental programme, established in the framework of a joint Russia-France agreement, has been set up to confirm the validity of this possibility considering a fast reactor design where Np 237 is homogenised uniformly in the fuel. Four cores have been built for this purpose. The BFS 67 -I core is a conventional fast reactor core mock-up which serves as a reference core for the Np 237 burner core design. The core has a central enriched plutonium zone surrounded by a uranium <b>driver</b> <b>zone.</b> In {{the central part of the}} BFS- 67 - 1 core, a zone with different Neptunium content (13. 1 % then 6. 5 %) was introduced to create the BFS 67 - 2, 3 and 3 B cores. Measurements in these cores concern the critical masses, spectral indices, sodium void reactivity worth and the central reactivity worth of various materials...|$|E
40|$|Nuclear {{power plants}} are {{expected}} {{to play an important}} role in the worldwide electricity production in the coming decades, since they provide an economically attractive, reliable and low-carbon source of electricity with plenty of resources available for at least the coming hundreds of years. However, the design of nuclear reactors can be improved significantly in terms of safety, by designing reactors with fully passive safety systems, and sustainability, by making more efficient use of natural resources in so-called breeder reactors, and by reducing the radiotoxicity and storage time of the waste produced by the reactor. The application of a thorium breeder fuel cycle within a Pebble Bed High Temperature Reactor could provide such improvements. The core of a Pebble Bed Reactor (PBR) consists of a helium cooled random stacking of graphite spheres, which contain many small coated fuel particles retaining radioactive fission products for temperatures below 1600 degrees Celsius. In case of a Depressurized Loss of Forced Cooling (DLOFC), the most serious accident that can occur in a PBR, decay heat can be removed from the core by passive means without the maximum fuel temperature exceeding 1600 degrees Celsius. This is due to its relatively small core radius and low power density. Thorium fuel cycles offer several interesting advantages. Thorium is three to four times more abundant in the earth's crust than uranium. In a closed breeder cycle, thorium can significantly reduce the radiotoxicity and storage time of nuclear waste, and all natural resources mined, i. e. Th- 232 or U- 235 and U- 238, can be used for electricity production instead of roughly 1 % of the natural uranium resources consumed by current light water reactors. Furthermore, the Th/U- 233 fuel cycle has favourable nuclear properties, i. e. the neutron reproduction factor of U- 233 and the relatively high thermal neutron capture cross section of Th- 232, for use in thermal breeder reactors, like a PBR. This thesis work investigates whether it is possible to achieve a thorium breeder fuel cycle in a pebble bed reactor within a practical operating regime and without compromising passive safety. Furthermore, the reactor should also achieve a net U- 233 production within a limited time frame. Neutronics studies of the fuel design show that the conversion of thorium into U- 233 can be maximized for thorium pebbles with a large heavy metal loading of 30 g, a conservative maximum from a fuel fabrication perspective, and a standard fuel kernel radius of 0. 025 cm, preferably irradiated at low specific power to improve k-inf. Reprocessing or adding moderator pebbles is required to raise the k-inf of these pebbles above unity. Cylindrical cores, consisting of a central <b>driver</b> <b>zone</b> surrounded by a breeder zone and reflector regions, were investigated during equilibrium core design studies. 30 g thorium pebbles are inserted in the breeder zone, while a higher carbon to heavy metal ratio is used in the <b>driver</b> <b>zone.</b> Results obtained by an equilibrium core calculation scheme show that the uranium content from both the discharged driver and uranium pebbles has to be reprocessed after their final passage to achieve breeding. As a next step, coupled neutronic and thermal-hydraulic design studies using a coupled DALTON/THERMIX code scheme were performed to investigate whether it is possible to combine passive safety and breeding, within a practical operating regime, inside a thorium PBR. Additionally, the equilibrium core calculation scheme was extended to include the spectral influence of surrounding zones (driver, breeder and reflector) into the fuel depletion calculations. High conversion ratios (CR > 0. 96) and passive safety can be combined in a thorium PBR within a practical operating regime. Increasing the U- 233 content of the fresh driver pebbles (18 w%), breeding (CR= 1. 0135) can already be achieved for a 220 cm core and 80 cm <b>driver</b> <b>zone</b> radius, but the temperature feedback is too weak to compensate the reactivity insertion due to decay of Xe- 135 during a DLOFC without scram. With a lower U- 233 content per driver pebble (10 w%), breeding (CR= 1. 0036) and passive safety can be combined for a 300 cm core and 100 cm <b>driver</b> <b>zone</b> radius operating at a power of 100 MWth, but this requires a doubling of the pebble handling speed and a high fuel pebble reprocessing rate, which may present a challenge from an engineering perspective. The maximum fuel temperature during a DLOFC without scram was 1481 degrees Celsius, still quite a bit below the TRISO failure temperature. The maximum reactivity insertion due to water ingress is also limited (+ 1497 pcm). For this 100 MWth passively safe thorium breeder PBR design, the total control rod worth is far insufficient in the radial reflector to achieve cold reactor shutdown, requiring a worth of over 15, 000 pcm. 3 D heterogeneous KENO calculations show that 20 control rods, positioned just outside the <b>driver</b> <b>zone,</b> can provide sufficient reactivity worth. Furthermore, the insertion of a neutron absorber gas, like BF 3, can be considered as an additional emergency shutdown system. Finally, the running-in phase of the passively safe thorium breeder PBR was analysed using a simplified core depletion model, which solves the depletion equations with an axial fuel movement term for the most relevant actinides and a lumped fission product pair. Enriched uranium (U- 235 /U- 238) is used during the first 1300 days of reactor operation and U- 233 /Th fuel is used afterwards. By clever adjustment of the enrichment or U- 233 weight fraction of the feed driver fuel over time, the thorium PBR can start to breed U- 233 within 7 years after starting reactor operation. Furthermore, a basic safety analysis for the various stages of the running-in phase indicates that passive safety is also ensured during any stage of the running-in phase. This thesis work demonstrates that it is possible to achieve breeding within a passively safe thorium pebble bed reactor after a limited time (< 7 years), though the margins in terms of breeding, passive safety and practical constraints are rather small. Therefore, the passively safe thorium breeder PBR design presented requires a doubling of the fuel pebble handling speed, compared to the HTR-PM, and a high fuel pebble reprocessing rate, while also some other technical difficulties still have to be addressed, such as the large pumping power requirement and the modelling of the conus region and defueling chutes. However, these issues are no fundamental limitation for the application of a thorium breeder cycle within a passively safe PBR, which could offer a huge improvement in terms of safety and sustainability of nuclear power for future generations.

40|$|Abstract — Driver’s gaze {{direction}} {{is a critical}} information in understanding driver state. In this paper, we present a distributed camera framework to estimate driver’s coarse gaze direction using both head and eye cues. Coarse gaze {{direction is}} often sufficient {{in a number of}} applications, however, the chal-lenge is to estimate gaze direction robustly in naturalistic real-world driving. Towards this end, we propose gaze-surrogate features estimated from eye region via eyelid and iris analysis. We present a novel iris detection computational framework. We are able to extract proposed features robustly and determine <b>driver’s</b> gaze <b>zone</b> effectively. We evaluated the proposed system on a dataset, collected from naturalistic on-road driving in urban streets and freeways. A human expert annotated <b>driver’s</b> gaze <b>zone</b> ground truth using information from the driver’s eyes and the surrounding context. We conducted two experiments to compare the performance of the gaze zone estimation with and without eye cues. The head-alone experiment has a reasonably good result for most of the gaze zones with an overall 79. 8 % of weighted accuracy. By adding eye cues, the experimental result shows that the overall weighted accuracy is boosted to 94. 9 %, and all the individual gaze zones have a better true detection rate especially between the adjacent zones. Therefore, our experimental evaluations show efficacy of the proposed features and very promising results for robust gaze zone estimation. I...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn Europe, {{the number}} of road crashes is {{steadily}} decreasing every year. However, the incidence of bicycle crashes is not declining as fast as that of car crashes. In Sweden, cyclists are the most frequently injured road users. Collisions between bicycles and motorized vehicles are of particular concern because the high speed and large mass of motorized vehicles create {{a high risk of}} serious injury to cyclists. In Sweden's urban areas, bicycle lanes keep bicycles separated from motorized vehicles, but on rural roads bicycle lanes are often absent, requiring drivers to interact with cyclists—usually by overtaking them. During this maneuver, drivers regulate speed and lateral position, negotiating with potential oncoming traffic to stay within their comfort zones while approaching and passing cyclists. In this study an instrumented bicycle recorded 145 overtaking maneuvers performed by car and truck drivers on public rural roads in Sweden. The bicycle was equipped with a LIDAR and two cameras to assess how drivers approached and circumvented the bicycle. The collected data allowed us to identify four overtaking phases and quantify the corresponding <b>driver</b> comfort <b>zones.</b> The presence of an oncoming vehicle was the factor that most influenced the maneuver, whereas neither vehicle speed, lane width, shoulder width nor posted speed limit significantly affected the <b>driver</b> comfort <b>zone</b> or the overtaking dynamics...|$|R
40|$|In Europe, {{the number}} of road crashes is decreasing, while {{the number of}} crashes {{involving}} cyclists are not decreasing {{at the same rate as}} car crashes. Crashes which occur while the vehicle is overtaking a cyclist often result in severe injuries or fatalities. Understanding the behaviour of car drivers overtaking cyclists, can facilitate increased road safety through improved guidelines and policies, as well as in-vehicle technologies. This study investigates how car drivers overtake cyclists on rural roads in four European countries by analysing the UDrive naturalistic driving data. One objective is to understand if, in different countries, there is a difference in the lateral distance when the car is passing the cyclist. Other objective is to investigate if the time-to-collision (TTC), at the start of the overtaking, affects the lateral distance when the car is passing the cyclist. Minor differences between countries were found with respect to lateral distance. Greater lateral distance while passing cyclists was observed with increase in time-to-collision at the start of the overtaking. Furthermore, vehicle speed, distance between the lane edge and the cyclists, and the presence of leading vehicle significantly affected the <b>driver</b> comfort <b>zone.</b> The <b>driver</b> comfort <b>zone</b> during overtaking manoeuvres from naturalistic driving data could provide information for legislators and policy makers in Europe, as well as support safety system design in the automotive industry...|$|R

30|$|As {{can be seen}} {{in model}} 1, the {{marginal}} effects of risk factors on the crash severity of a driver who is involved in collision types 3 and 4 (sideswipe and other) in work zone weather-related crashes can be identified. Speed limit is one of the factors found to be significant in model 1. In fact, a higher speed limit dramatically increases the severity of work zone weather-related crashes. More specifically, <b>drivers</b> in work <b>zone</b> weather-related crashes occurred in a segment with less than 55  mph posted speed limit were 13 % less likely to be involved in severe crashes (the marginal effect is −[*] 0.13 in Table  2) in comparison with the reference level (drivers who were driving in a work zone segment with a posted speed limit greater than 55  mph). In fact, driving over the speed limit could be risky because it provides insufficient time for suitable response to control and handle unexpected situations, and this might be exacerbated during adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain or fog.|$|R
30|$|Our {{empirical}} {{starting point}} {{is the fact that}} the traffic system is probably the largest subsystem of modern society.

(Professional <b>drivers</b> constitute a <b>zone</b> of intersection between the situational and the occupational definition of roles.) Parsons conceptualises culture within a framework of systems of interaction of a plurality of actors and argues that it is a prerequisite for the functioning of interaction systems. A common culture allows the articulation of actors with social systems (roles) as the basis of reciprocity of action orientation (including conflict) as well as integration of different systems of action [6]. Culture is conceptualised in the tradition of US American social anthropology [15] as a set of symbolic patterns that tend to be organised in systems (e.g. classifications, styles, etc.) and that must be objectified in symbolic forms in order to be transmittable through space and time.|$|R

The new process incorporates a Performance Measure/Treatment matrix, which recommends multiple performance measures, each of which is chosen to measure the mobility impacts particular to a specific work zone implementation. Most importantly, the revised decision-making process incorporates a feedback loop. Quantitative data collected in work zones is analyzed after the work zone is complete, to determine the impacts specific decisions had on mobility in the work zone.

This study investigates whether in-car warnings on a head-up display (HUD) improve speed compliance and speed behaviour of young male passenger car <b>drivers</b> at work <b>zones.</b> A HUD warning system was {{tested in a}} repeated measures fixed-base driving simulator experiment with 34 participants. Drivers slowed down sooner and smoother when the warning system was enabled, but speed behaviour at the work zone was not different when the system was active. Drivers who sped outside of the work zones had lower pre-experimental satisfaction of the system although this increased to normal levels during the experiment. Perceived effects of the system were limited to a small reduction in stated mental effort. This {{is in line with}} literature findings. Although the system improves speed behaviour in the slow-down area and may {{have a positive effect on}} traffic safety, it does not improve speed compliance at work zones. The system can reach its target audience by integrating it with systems which provide directly perceivable benefits to drivers. Further research is required on the effects on other driver groups and the potential of personalised situation-aware warnings. Civil Engineering and GeosciencesTransport & PlanningTIL 506...|$|R
40|$|September 2003. "Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 23 - 25) A nighttime {{field study}} was conducted to assess how several attributes of personal safety garments affect pedestrian conspicuity. Three types of ANSI/ISEA 107 - 1999 compliant Class 2 and Class 3 garments, like those frequently worn by road construction workers, were examined. Participants drove an instrumented research vehicle on a closed track, through simulated construction zones with naturalistic sight distances, and indicated when they first detected a pedestrian wearing one of the garments. The independent variables included trim intensity (RA), ANSI/ISEA garment classification/configuration, color of the trim, location of the pedestrian within the work <b>zone,</b> <b>driver</b> age, and driver gender. The distance at which each garment could first be detected served as the measure of garment conspicuity. The results show that garment classification/configuration, trim color, location of the pedestrian, and driver age all had significant effects on the distance at which garments could be detected. Over the ranges examined, neither the intensity nor the amount of trim material affected conspicuity. However, placement of the trim had a significant effect on conspicuity. Specifically, placing retroreflective trim on the arms of a Class 3 jacket, when compared with a Class 3 vest, significantly increased conspicuity of a pedestrian in motion. Nevertheless, any amount of retroreflective trim—regardless of its placement on the garment, color, or intensity—improved detection distance by as much as a factor of 7. 8 when compared with a darkly clad pedestrian...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} years, the global {{movement}} of people and goods has been increasing. Especially for personal transports, cars are the most frequent choice, resulting not only in a high market share, but also in problems such as pollution, traffic jams and congestion. However, there are alternatives; for instance cycling, which is a healthy, economical and environmentally friendly solution. For these reasons, the number of cyclists is in fact growing very rapidly in Europe. Nevertheless, this modal shift might rise unforeseen concerns. In particular, cycling safety has drawn the attention of many researchers worldwide. While cycling, the interaction with motorized vehicles deserves a special attention, as crashes with motorized vehicles {{are responsible for the}} most severe cycling injuries. Among the possible scenarios where vehicles and cyclists may encounter, overtaking maneuvers are of exceptional concern, as they happen at speeds that are usually higher than in other scenarios. In an overtaking scenario, the assessment of drivers’ comfort zone boundaries is a crucial aspect. Driver comfort boundaries are often used to investigate whether or not a situation feels safe and comfortable for the <b>driver.</b> Comfort <b>zone</b> boundaries are also used to determine when to trigger warnings or initiate autonomous interventions for active safety systems. In overtaking situations, comfort zone boundaries allow for an estimation of safety distances between the involved actors. Although research has been conducted on car-to-bicycle overtaking maneuvers, especially on what influences these safety distances, previous studies have mainly been limited to assess the lateral clearance between the bicycle and vehicle. Within this thesis, a new framework to enable field research of car-to-bicycle overtaking is presented. After providing a theoretical model for different phases of an overtaking maneuver, a field experiment was performed using an equipped bike and an equipped car. In these experiments, an electrical bicycle which had been equipped with sensors, cameras, a data logger and a LIDAR, was ridden on two roads in Västra Götaland, Sweden. In addition, an equipped car with a CAN logger, GPS and eye tracking system was used for the experiments. Data from the experiment were analyzed to determine the sensor performance {{and the extent to which}} data from the instrumented bicycle and the instrumented car were able to identify the phases of an overtaking maneuver and their corresponding comfort zone boundaries. This thesis also discusses the results in terms of the factors which may influence an overtaking maneuver and provides suggestions for future research on car-to-bicycle overtaking...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with how data from common automotive sensors can be processed and interpreted {{in order to support}} advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). More specifically, the thesis addresses aspects of object tracking using radar detections, mapping and self-localization for automated vehicles and driver monitoring. In automotive radar tracking, an observed vehicle typically generates multiple detections. This thesis presents a detailed sensor model that adapts to the detection properties of an object by jointly estimating the position of reflection centres and the position of the object. Moreover, the model considers the limited resolution of the radar and evaluation show results close to those achieved with a deterministic vehicle model where the reflecting properties are known. A second contribution to the area of object tracking is a generalization of the well-known cardinalized probability hypothesis density (CPHD) filter to incorporate objects that appear through spawning from existing targets. It is further shown that the generalized filter is tractable for some common birth and spawning models. For automated vehicles, some of the studied problems resemble those traditionally studied in robotics, such as mapping and localization. This thesis presents and evaluates a self-localization solution based on a set of automotive off-the-shelf sensors together with a map that contains lane markings and a simplistic description of radar landmarks. The evaluation shows that this map, in combination with real radar data, provides valuable information to the localization algorithm. With this motivation, a method for estimating more detailed radar maps is derived. The map is modelled by an inhomogeneous Poisson process describing the expected measurements from the static environment {{as a function of the}} sensor position. The estimation principle relies on a variational method where the number of landmarks and their respective parameters are found simultaneously. In addition to sensors that observe the vehicle and its surroundings, there are camera-based systems designed to monitor the driver behavior. In the context of driver distraction, this thesis presents a method for <b>driver</b> gaze <b>zone</b> estimation, i. e., estimation of which area the driver is currently looking at, using data provided by such monitoring systems. To improve robustness, the proposed solutions make use of functions that describe the gaze direction based on the head pose and eye closure. It is also shown how these functions can be learnt from data...|$|R
