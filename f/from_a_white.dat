25|$|The school {{currently}} teaches 87 pupils {{from the}} parish and surrounding villages.

Nearly six percent of pupils have Statements of Special Educational Needs, which is above the national average.

Between July and August he was acting commander of the division. In September, Kuibyshev became commander of the 9th Rifle Division's 3rd Brigade. He became commander of the division in January 1920, leading it until June 1921. In 1920, he was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. On 5 February 1921, Kuibyshev was awarded his second Order of the Red Banner, for his actions between September and November 1920, in which Kuibyshev's leadership was credited with saving the Donbass <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>White</b> attack and pushing the White troops back to Genichesk while capturing 5,000 prisoners.|$|E
25|$|By tradition, a lady of {{the court}} was instantaneously {{recognizable}} by her panniers, corset and weighty silk materials that constructed her gown {{in the style of}} à la française or à l’anglaise. By doing away with these things, Marie Antoinette’s gaulle or chemise á la Reine stripped female aristocrats of their traditional identity; noblewomen could now be confused with peasant girls, confusing long standing sartorial differences in class. The chemise was made <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> muslin and the queen was further accused of importing foreign fabrics and crippling the French silk industry. The gaulle consisted of thin layers of this muslin, loosely draped around the body and belted at the waist, and was often worn with an apron and a fichu. This trend was quickly adopted by fashionable women in France and England, but upon the debut of the portrait of Marie Antoinette by Elisabeth Vigée-Lebrun, the clothing style created a scandal and increased the hatred for the queen. The queen’s clothing in the portrait looked like a chemise, nothing more than a garment that women wore under her other clothing or to lounge in the intimate space of the private boudoir. It was perceived to be indecent, and especially unbecoming for the queen. The sexual nature of the gaulle undermined the notions of status and the ideology that gave her and kept her in power. Marie Antoinette wanted to be private and individual, a notion unbecoming for a member of the monarchy that is supposed to act {{as a symbol of the}} state.|$|E

500|$|The modules {{were well}} {{received}} by contemporary critics. In 1978, they earned a 9/10 overall rating <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>White</b> Dwarf magazine reviewer, who was impressed that Gygax {{found time to}} write them while also working on the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD) rulebooks. White Dwarf also reviewed the re-released G module series in 1982, giving it a 10 out of 10. The Queen of the Spiders supermodule, which consisted of the three modules combined with the subsequent modules in the [...] "D" [...] series and Q1 Queen of the Demonweb Pits, was voted the single greatest adventure of all time by Dungeon magazine in 2004, on the 30th anniversary of the Dungeons & Dragons game.|$|E
500|$|During {{his first}} years in WWE, Cena portrayed a vastly {{different}} character. This character, a white rapper who wore jerseys, backwards hats, and a chain with a padlock around his neck, {{was known as}} the [...] "Doctor of Thuganomics". Cena sometimes used underhanded tactics to score victories, such as using his chain as a weapon behind the referee's back. Cena often rapped before his matches, insulting his opponents, events that happened in the media, and even the crowd on occasion. Cena also regularly performed [...] "rap battles", where he and his opponent took turns rapping on each other. Cena reverted to this persona once during his feud with The Rock. In 2005, shortly after his first debut film, The Marine, his wrestling character was shifted <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> rapper to that of a young private.|$|E
500|$|W1 {{is found}} in Franches Montagnes horses descended <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> mare named Cigale born in 1957. Cigale's parents' coats were not {{extensively}} marked. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), a type of mutation in which a single nucleotide is accidentally exchanged for another, {{is thought to have}} occurred with Cigale. This mutation (c.2151C>G) is thought to severely affect the function of KIT. It is a nonsense mutation located on Exon15 of KIT [...] Some horses with the W1 mutation are born pure white, but many have residual pigment along the topline, which they may then lose over time. Based on studies of KIT mutations in mice, the severity of this mutation suggests that it may be nonviable in the homozygous state. However, horses with the W1 mutation have been found to have normal blood parameters and do not suffer from anemia.|$|E

500|$|The snoring rail is [...] {{long and}} weighs [...] It is flightless, with short wings, {{a very short}} tail and strong legs and feet. The back and the underparts from the forecrown to the breast are grey, apart <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> chin, and the sides and rear of the neck are deep orange-red. Most {{of the rest of}} the upperparts are brown, and the belly, flanks and undertail have white barring. The male has black legs, a yellow iris and a brown and greenish down-curved bill. The female is similar, but has a {{brighter}} hindneck colour, less white on the chin, a red iris, a cream and reddish bill and blue-grey legs. Immature and juvenile plumages are undescribed. Visual confusion with sympatric rails is unlikely. The blue-faced rail is similar in size, but is chestnut above and black below, and the buff-banded rail has strongly marked upperparts, breast and head. The slaty-breasted rail is smaller and has barred upperparts.|$|E
500|$|In {{an effort}} to portray the genius and {{humanity}} of the black race, Du Bois published The Souls of Black Folk (1903), a collection of 14 essays.Lewis, p. 191. James Weldon Johnson said the book's effect on African Americans was {{comparable to that of}} Uncle Tom's Cabin. The introduction famously proclaimed that [...] "the problem of the Twentieth Century is the problem of the color line". Each chapter begins with two epigraphs– one <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> poet, and one from a black spiritual– to demonstrate intellectual and cultural parity between black and white cultures. A major theme of the work was the double consciousness faced by African Americans: being both American and black. This was a unique identity which, according to Du Bois, had been a handicap in the past, but could be a strength in the future: [...] "Henceforth, the destiny of the race could be conceived as leading neither to assimilation nor separatism but to proud, enduring hyphenation." ...|$|E

[...] Gaga quipped that the dress was [...] "maybe a small step for Volantis... but a big-time step" [...] for her. The singer also announced plans to stage the first musical performance from space, following previous reports about her singing at Zero G Colony, a music festival scheduled to occur at Spaceport America in New Mexico in 2015.
