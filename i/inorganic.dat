5|$|Lithotrophic {{bacteria}} can use <b>inorganic</b> compounds {{as a source}} of energy. Common <b>inorganic</b> electron donors are hydrogen, carbon monoxide, ammonia (leading to nitrification), ferrous iron and other reduced metal ions, and several reduced sulfur compounds. In unusual circumstances, the gas methane can be used by methanotrophic bacteria as both a source of electrons and a substrate for carbon anabolism. In both aerobic phototrophy and chemolithotrophy, oxygen is used as a terminal electron acceptor, whereas under anaerobic conditions <b>inorganic</b> compounds are used instead. Most lithotrophic organisms are autotrophic, whereas organotrophic organisms are heterotrophic.|$|E

5|$|Exposure occurs through inhalation, {{ingestion}} or occasionally skin contact. Lead may {{be taken}} in through direct contact with mouth, nose, and eyes (mucous membranes), and through breaks in the skin. Tetraethyllead, which was a gasoline additive and is still used in fuels such as aviation fuel, passes through the skin; however <b>inorganic</b> lead found in paint, food, and most lead-containing consumer products is only minimally absorbed through the skin. The main sources of absorption of <b>inorganic</b> lead are from ingestion and inhalation. In adults, about 35–40% of inhaled lead dust is deposited in the lungs, and about 95% of {{that goes into the}} bloodstream. Of ingested <b>inorganic</b> lead, about 15% is absorbed, but this percentage is higher in children, pregnant women, and people with deficiencies of calcium, zinc, or iron. Infants may absorb about 50% of ingested lead, but little is known about absorption rates in children.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis {{research}} {{investigates the}} catalytic properties of char which was recovered {{directly from a}} biomass gasifier. Poplar wood was gasified in steam and CO 2 environments in a fluidized bed reactor at temperatures ranging from 550 to 920 degrees C. Char was composed of 85 % carbon with concentrations of N, H, and S between 0. 3 % and 3 %, depending on gasification conditions. The <b>inorganics</b> (Ca, K, Na, P, Si, Mg) were quantified, revealing that Ca was present in the highest concentration (0. 5 - 1 %), followed by K, ranging from 0. 1 % to 0. 8 %. The char had catalytic activity for decomposition of methane, which {{was used as a}} model molecule. The quantity of <b>inorganics</b> in the char was modified by acid washing in 16 % aqueous HCl, which removed > 95 % of Ca, K, P, and Mg from the char. This resulted in an 18 % decrease in the quantity of methane reacted compared to the original char sample, demonstrating that <b>inorganics,</b> which only make up approximately 2 % of the char, {{play a significant role in}} its catalytic activity for methane cracking reactions. In addition, carbon was found to play an important role in the catalytic activity of the char, both as a catalyst and a support on which the <b>inorganics</b> were dispersed. The activity of carbon free ash was approximately 90 % lower than that of char, and deactivated to have no measurable activity after 45 min on stream, demonstrating the importance of carbon and dispersed <b>inorganics</b> for catalytic activity. When char was heated to 1000 degrees C in N- 2, <b>inorganics</b> and oxygen migrated to the surface of the char, covering the carbon surface in a metal oxide layer. This decreased the catalytic activity by approximately 40 %. Acidic (e. g. carboxylic, lactones) and basic (e. g. carbonyl, pyrone) oxygen functional groups were identified on the char surface. However, acidic oxygen groups desorbed at reaction temperatures, so these groups likely do not participate in cracking reactions. (c) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

5|$|Bacteria {{are further}} divided into lithotrophs that use <b>inorganic</b> {{electron}} donors and organotrophs that use organic compounds as electron donors. Chemotrophic organisms use the respective electron donors for energy conservation (by aerobic/anaerobic respiration or fermentation) and biosynthetic reactions (e.g., carbon dioxide fixation), whereas phototrophic organisms use them only for biosynthetic purposes. Respiratory organisms use chemical compounds {{as a source}} of energy by taking electrons from the reduced substrate and transferring them to a terminal electron acceptor in a redox reaction. This reaction releases energy {{that can be used to}} synthesise ATP and drive metabolism. In aerobic organisms, oxygen is used as the electron acceptor. In anaerobic organisms other <b>inorganic</b> compounds, such as nitrate, sulfate or carbon dioxide are used as electron acceptors. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively.|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{outlines}} {{an update}} of the fate and exposure {{part of the}} fate, exposure and effects model USES-LCA. The new fate and exposure module of USES-LCA was applied to calculate human population intake fractions and fate factors of the freshwater, marine and terrestrial environment for 3393 substances, including neutral organics, dissociating organics and <b>inorganics,</b> emitted to 7 different emission compartments. The human population intake fraction is on average 10 - 5 - 10 - 8 for organics and 10 - 3 - 10 - 4 for <b>inorganics,</b> depending on the emission compartment considered. Chemical-specific human population intake fractions can be 1 - 2. 7 orders of magnitude higher or lower compared to the typical estimates. For <b>inorganics,</b> the human population intake fractions highly depend {{on the assumption that}} exposure via food products can be modelled with constant bioconcentration factors. The environmental fate factor is on average 10 - 11 - 10 - 18 days m- 3 for organics and 10 - 10 - 10 - 12 days m- 3 for <b>inorganics,</b> depending on the receiving environment and the emission compartment considered. Chemical-specific environmental fate factors can be 1 - 8 orders of magnitude higher or lower compared to the typical estimates. The largest differences between the new and old version of USES-LCA are found for emissions to air and soil. This is caused by a significant change {{in the structure of the}} air and soil compartments in the new version of USES-LCA, i. e. the distinction between rural and urban air, including rain-no rain conditions and including soil depth dependent intermedia transport...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The study {{aimed to}} analyze {{potential}} environmental burdens of different waste-to-energy technologies through LCA model. LCA model is developed by SimaPro software by considering Ecoindicator 99 method. Landfill, Incineration, Pyrolysis-Gasification and Anaerobic Digestion are analyzed by considering emission {{to the atmosphere}} per unit electricity generation. Results show that, Landfill and Incineration have the highest climate change impact among the four WTE options. Incineration and P-G has the significant impact on respiratory <b>inorganics</b> and acidification categories. AD has the lowest impacts on respiratory <b>inorganics</b> and acidification.
