International Workshop on Sustainable Extensive and Semi-intensie Coastal Aquaculture in Southern Europe (SEACASE), Tavira, Portugal, january 20 - 21, 2010. <b>Extensive</b> <b>fish</b> <b>culture</b> in earthern ponds “esteros” is a {{traditional}} activity in the salt-marshes area surrounding the Bay of Cádiz (S.

This culture system started as a sub-activity associated to salt exploitation, but {{in the second half}} of 20 th century became more relevant with the progressive abandon of salt-works. This study has been carried out with the financial support from the Commission of the European Communities, specific RTD programme “Specific Support to Policies”, SSP- 2005 - 44483 "SEACASE".

40|$|Integrated agriculture-cum-fish farming {{has been}} practised profitably for ages in the Chinese {{small-scale}} farming system. There {{is a great}} potential for this system by utilizing the vast Nigerian flood plains (approx. 515, 000 ha). Dogongari Bay in Lake Kainji Basin {{was identified as a}} suitable site for this system after some <b>extensive</b> <b>fish</b> <b>culture</b> trials. Polyculture of Clarias spp., Heterotis niloticus and Tilapia was proposed for integration with layers in the poultry house, 2 -ha upland rain-fed rice farming and indirect cattle rearing in the 5 -ha enclosure site. Cost benefit analysis showed that the system will consistently record profit as from the second year of operation. Various complex factors were identified to affect profitability of this mixed farming system. Concerted research approach is needed to fully understand the interrelationships of the various components of this integrated system. Generous funding of research activities is very crucial in this situatio...|$|E
40|$|Explosion {{of human}} {{population}} and the decreasing food supply from terrestrial sources have diverted man's attention towards the aquatic environment for supplementing his food requirements. Thus, aquaculture has been gaining importance for achieving additional production of proteinaceous food. The continually expanding demand for protein-rich fishery products, the stagnating capture fish production, the risk prone, capital-intensive and technology-oriented deep sea exploitation, the ever-increasing fuel costs, coupled {{with the need to}} generate more employment opportunities for the rural traditional fishermen have all created an awareness among scientists, policy makers, fishfarmers and enterpreneurs to evolve new strategies for converting the vast derelict swamps and low lying water bodies adjacent to backwaters and coastal zones into productive fish farms at a comparatively low cost and with the locally available technologies. In view of these factors, it is generally felt that the traditional <b>extensive</b> <b>fish</b> <b>culture</b> practices with minimum inputs is a more attractive, feasible and economically viable solution to increase fish production, rather than to concentrate on an already stagnating coastal capture fisheries or to venture into the uncertain deep sea for exploitation...|$|E

40|$|International audienceNutrient-rich {{freshwater}} {{ecosystems are}} generally considered as having low ecological quality and low associated biodiversity. In such systems we analysed {{the effects of}} water quality on biodiversity of several species groups, to determine tipping points and tools for monitoring. We investigated the water quality of 99 eutrophic and hypertrophic shallow lakes with <b>extensive</b> <b>fish</b> <b>culture</b> during a 3 -year study, through the measures of physico-chemical parameters, phytoplankton biomass and structure. In a second step, we related the water quality with richness of aquatic plants, macroinvertebrates and dragonflies. With concentrations of chlorophyll-a above 30 or 70 mu g l(- 1), shallow lakes are normally classified, respectively, in a poor or bad ecological state. However, our results show that chlorophyll-a concentrations up to 78 mu g l(- 1) could be found together with relatively high species or family richness of aquatic plants, invertebrates and dragonflies. We identified most tipping points with 50 - 60 mu g l(- 1) of chlorophyll-a, values above which a significant decrease of species diversity was found. For monitoring of these shallow lakes we propose to use chlorophyll-a concentrations in combination with water transparency during spring. These parameters are easily applicable and cheap and they yield a good forecast of the biodiversity for the species groups studied...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a case study}} of the evolution of the freshwater food fish and marine food <b>fish</b> <b>culture</b> industries in Hong Kong as a highly urbanized and polluted metropolis. This study lends support to the thesis that marine <b>fish</b> <b>culture</b> is generally more sustainable than pond <b>fish</b> <b>culture,</b> owing to the fact that oceanic resources are relatively less scarce than land resources - even though the transaction costs of delineating and enforcing private property in the former are much higher. The case study gives a brief historical account of the evolution of the freshwater food fish and marine food <b>fish</b> <b>culture</b> industries in Hong Kong, identifies the technical inputs constraining the survival and prospects of these industries, and evaluates the relevance of the private property rights approach to their sustainability. Examination of the culture industries reveals the differences in property right characteristics of both industries. In addition to the differentiation in the degree of privatization between freshwater food fish and marine food <b>fish</b> <b>culture,</b> the major characteristics and inputs for culture practices in both industries are also examined. A qualitative evaluation of the relative significance of these inputs to the sustainability of the culture industries is provided. It is argued that the escalation in the factor price of land will destroy the local pond <b>fish</b> <b>culture</b> industry even though it is more 'private' than marine <b>fish</b> <b>culture,</b> notwithstanding the fact that substantial areas of intertidal ponds are owned by government and that in-filling of fishponds have been subject to stringent planning control.
