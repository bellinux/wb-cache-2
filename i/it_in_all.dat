Her eggs are sealed in a basket woven by her mother, who gives it to Coyote, instructing him not to open it before he reaches home. Hearing voices coming from it, however, Coyote opens the basket and the people, the world's first human beings, pour out of <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> directions.|$|E

5|$|Tuau Lapua Lapua participated on Tuvalu's behalf in the men's featherweight (62 kilogram) weightlifting competition. He was {{the oldest}} person to {{represent}} Tuvalu at age 21 and had not participated in any previous Olympic Games. Lapua qualified for the games by earning a wildcard place based on his performance at the 2012 Oceania Weightlifting Championships in Apia, Samoa. Before his event {{he said that he}} was delighted to compete in the competition and wanted to make Tuvalu proud. His event took place in 31 July, and included 14 athletes in total. During the event's snatch phase, Lapua was given three attempts. He successfully attempted to lift over 90 kilograms of weight in his first two attempts, but did not achieve this objective on the third attempt. Lapua then attempted 130 kilograms during the clean and jerk phrase of the event, successfully lifting <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> three of his attempts. Overall, the combination of Lapua's highest scores in snatch (108) and clean and jerk (135) yielded a score of 243 points. He ranked 12th in the event, ahead of Charles Ssekyaaya of Uganda (235 points) and behind El Salvador's Julio Salamanca (260 points). Lapua was 84 points behind the gold medallist Kim Un-guk from North Korea.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to its use in spark-gap radio transmitters and electrotherapy described above, the Tesla coil circuit was also used in the early 20th century in x-ray machines, ozone generators for water purification, and induction heating equipment. However, in the 1920s vacuum tube oscillators replaced <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> these applications. The triode vacuum tube was a much better radio frequency current generator than the noisy, hot, ozone-producing spark, and could produce continuous waves. After this, industrial use of the Tesla coil was mainly limited to a few specialized applications which were suited to its unique characteristics, such as high voltage insulation testing.|$|E

25|$|In 1897, Steuerman was a {{contributor}} to Noutatea ("The Novelty"), an independent daily published in Iași by the Jewish poet Berman Goldner-Giordano.

Its regular contributors were young supporters of left-wing ideologies: alongside Steuerman and Giordano, they include poet Mihail Codreanu and future jurist Eugen Heroveanu. With Codreanu, Steuerman (who usually disguised his name under the signatures Rodion, Aster, Leander and Tristis) took charge of the literary column and the poetry section. They were sporadically joined by other writers, among them Laura Vampa, Alexandru Toma, I. A. Bassarabescu, George Ranetti etc.|$|E

25|$|Besides all this, Hamilton was a voluminous correspondent. Often {{a single}} letter of Hamilton's {{occupied}} from fifty {{to a hundred}} or more closely written pages, all devoted to the minute consideration of every feature of some particular problem; for {{it was one of}} the peculiar characteristics of Hamilton's mind never to be satisfied with a general understanding of a question; Hamilton pursued the problem until he knew <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> its details. Hamilton was ever courteous and kind in answering applications for assistance in the study of his works, even when his compliance must have cost him much time. He was excessively precise and hard to please with reference to the final polish of his own works for publication; and it was probably for this reason that he published so little compared with the extent of his investigations.|$|E
25|$|Charles Fox Parham, an {{independent}} holiness evangelist who believed strongly in divine healing, {{was an important}} figure {{to the emergence of}} Pentecostalism as a distinct Christian movement. In 1900, he started a school near Topeka, Kansas, which he named Bethel Bible School. There he taught that speaking in tongues was the scriptural evidence for the reception of the baptism with the Holy Spirit. On January 1, 1901, after a watch night service, the students prayed for and received the baptism with the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues. Parham received this same experience sometime later and began preaching <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> his services. Parham believed this was xenoglossia and that missionaries would no longer need to study foreign languages. After 1901, Parham closed his Topeka school and began a four-year revival tour throughout Kansas and Missouri. He taught that the baptism with the Holy Spirit was a third experience, subsequent to conversion and sanctification. Sanctification cleansed the believer, but Spirit baptism empowered for service.|$|E

500|$|Motography {{included}} a {{brief review of}} the film which states, [...] "This is indeed a well presented historical subject. The action has breadth and historical perspective, with stirring scenes and large groupings, {{and at the same time}} there is a human plot threading its way through the historical background and giving the action a specific interest. The last scene, showing Santa Anna's surrender [...] "as a common soldier," [...] is rather obscure. One wonders why he did <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> <b>all</b> other scenes the action is clear and effective. It would be a stolid audience indeed that failed to respond to the thrilling scene inside the Alamo."

[...] Roger Ebert gave it {{three out of four}} stars, calling it [...] "one of the most innocent movies in a long time,” and “a sweet, warm-hearted comedy." [...] Richard Roeper called the film [...] "one of my favorite movies of all time. It {{has one of the highest}} 'repeatability' factors of any film I've ever seen ... I can watch it again and again. There's also this, and I say <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> sincerity: Ferris Bueller's Day Off is something of a suicide prevention film, or at the very least a story about a young man trying to help his friend gain some measure of self-worth ... Ferris has made it his mission to show Cameron that the whole world in front of him is passing him by, and that life can be pretty sweet if you wake up and embrace it. That's the lasting message of Ferris Bueller's Day Off." [...] Roeper pays homage to the film with a license plate that reads [...] "SVFRRIS".
