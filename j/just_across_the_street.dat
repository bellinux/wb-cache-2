25|$|Then, unexpectedly, Tej and Rish are {{reunited with}} nearly their entire family. Their {{relatives}} {{have come to}} Barrayar to acquire the financial resources needed to attempt to take back their House. Tej's grandmother knows of an underground Cetagandan bunker forgotten since the Cetagandan invasion had been defeated a century ago. It is filled with looted treasure, {{but it turns out}} that Imperial Security's headquarters has inadvertently been built <b>just</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> from where the bunker is buried. Ivan is drawn into the scheme to dig their way to it (very quietly using an experimental biological organism). When the smuggler the baron had hired to transport the treasure trove proves to be more interested in the bounty on the family, the entire scheme falls apart, literally explosively, and they end up trapped in the bunker. Fortunately, Imperial Security digs them out and Ivan secures his future happiness with Tej.|$|E

Attempts to trace the windows were unsuccessful and the previous owner was successfully prosecuted.|$|R

25|$|The Donald L. Tucker Center is {{the home}} for Seminole {{basketball}} is {{named in honor of}} Donald L. Tucker, Esq., a former Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives and Special Ambassador for the United States to the Dominican Republic. Prior to the 2000–01 basketball season, the center completed an expansion project which began in October of 1998 in which 34 luxury suites and 468 club seats at mid-level in the arena were added. In addition, the upper level seating was configured to offer better viewing and additional concession stands and restrooms were added. The Spotlight Grill, a 450-seat arena-view restaurant includes an outdoor patio and ledge seating for viewing arena events. The multi-purpose facility, which opened its doors in 1981, covers over 22 acres in the heart of Tallahassee's downtown district. The Civic Center is only two blocks from the Capitol building and is <b>just</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> from FSU's nationally-acclaimed Law School and Center for Professional Development. The complex covers over 18,000 square feet with 119-foot ceilings in the main arena. The Tucker Center is actually three different areas combined under one roof.

The complex also features a terrace, which is popular for outdoor hosting.|$|E
25|$|The Journal {{claims to}} have sent the first news report, on the Dow Jones wire, of a plane {{crashing}} into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Its headquarters, at One World Financial Center, was severely damaged {{by the collapse of}} the World Trade Center <b>just</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> Top editors worried that they might miss publishing the first issue {{for the first time in}} the paper's 112-year history. They relocated to a makeshift office at an editor's home, while sending most of the staff to Dow Jones's South Brunswick, N.J., corporate campus, where the paper had established emergency editorial facilities soon after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The paper was on the stands the next day, albeit in scaled-down form. Perhaps the most compelling story in that day's edition was a first-hand account of the Twin Towers' collapse written by then-Foreign Editor (and current Washington bureau chief) John Bussey, who holed up in a ninth-floor Journal office, literally in the shadow of the towers, from where he phoned in live reports to CNBC as the towers burned. He narrowly escaped serious injury when the first tower collapsed, shattering all the windows in the Journal offices and filling them with dust and debris. The Journal won a 2002 Pulitzer Prize in Breaking News Reporting for that day's stories.|$|E

5000|$|While {{working his}} day job as a banker, Milburn was engaged in Denver's art scene and {{recorded}} an album called [...] "Exotique". Although not a commercial success, it created enough interest in his musical and artistic talents that {{he was invited to}} many private art parties in the mid-1980s in New York's thriving downtown art scene. Milburn had originated the two main foundational pieces for his eventual museum collection called The Universalist Group in 1981 in his Denver studio situated in the bohemian NoHo section of Denver <b>just</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> 15th <b>Street</b> viaduct from downtown Denver.

60|$|Then let me {{give you}} a vivid little {{impression}} I received of a certain prosaic person, a grocer, named Wiggins, and how he passed through the Change. I heard this man's story in the post-office at Menton, when, in the afternoon of the First Day, I bethought me to telegraph to my mother. The place was also a grocer's shop, and I found him and the proprietor talking as I went in. They were trade competitors, and Wiggins had <b>just</b> come <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> to break <b>the</b> hostile silence of a score of years. The sparkle of the Change was in their eyes, their slightly flushed cheeks, their more elastic gestures, spoke of new physical influences that had invaded their beings.|$|R
50|$|Scholars {{are divided}} on the {{interpretation}} of how Catullus addresses Furius and Aurelius in this poem. Some {{think that he is}} being serious and truly holds Furius and Aurelius as some of his closest friends that he will have until he dies. Others believe that Catullus has more of an ironic tone. For example, Catullus' tone switches dramatically {{in the second half of}} the poem, as he asks them to <b>just</b> walk <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> to Catullus after naming all these far away places to go to. This hints that Catullus' tone might be more on the ironical side. But, in general, it can be argued either way, as it seems he is serious in the first half, but this seriousness is deflated in the last 2 stanzas of the poem.|$|R

2500|$|On January 22, 2007, the MTA {{opened a}} new {{entrance}} on {{the southeast corner of}} Maiden Lane and Broadway.

That month, construction began on creating an analogous entrance on Cortlandt Street, <b>just</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> from Broadway, for the southbound platform. No crossunder or crossover was constructed to link the two platforms. These entrances would allow for the temporary closure of the John Street entrance (northbound platform) and the entrance by Dey Street (southbound platform) during the rehabilitation of the [...] platforms and Dey Street Passageway related work.|$|E

A milldam diverted water through a millrace, where it turned the mill's large turbine (when it was operational, the turbine was almost completely submerged). [...] After the state purchased the mill in 1967, a new roof and a new coat of paint were added. [...] The mill is no longer operational.|$|R
50|$|In Catullus 11, {{there is}} a {{different}} tone in the way Catullus addresses his friends Furius and Aurelius than how they are usually mentioned in other poems. In other poems, they are usually addressed by Catullus in a condescending manner, but in this poem, he addresses them in a very serious manner. Also, {{in the first three}} stanzas, Catullus implies that he will go with Furius and Aurelius to several different places around the world, trying to express how good of friends they are, but, ironically, he asks them to <b>just</b> walk <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> and break up with his girlfriend without him. Another unusual thing Catullus does in this poem is that he complements Caesar in line 9. This in very uncharacteristic of Catullus as compared to his other poems, as he is usually not very complementary of Caesar. Throughout {{the first half of the}} poem, Catullus builds a very romantic atmosphere through his writing. But, in the second half, the mood of the poem turns drastically, as he starts insulting Lesbia.|$|R
