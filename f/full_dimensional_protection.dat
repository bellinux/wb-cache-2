40|$|The Battle Command Battle Laboratory is the U. S. Army’s {{test bed}} for {{advanced}} networking and telecommunications experimentation. Over {{the past two}} years the lab has conducted a series of experiments focused on the Army’s conceptual Future Force network. These experiments were designed to integrate a myriad of network-related study issues into a technical analysis of future network concepts. The results of these experiments provide the analytical underpinnings supporting the viability of transitioning the conceptual design of the Army’s Future Force into an actual warfighting entity. The Army’s Future Force is designed to be a faster, lighter, but more lethal force than today’s force. The Future Force will use information superiority as its premier combat enabler. Information superiority coupled with an ultra-reliable networked Battle Command and Control (C 2) system will ensure that separate units fight as one. This connectivity and orchestration are performed within a network-centric environment. The Army’s view of Network Centric Warfare can be described as the orchestration of integrated successes of its core operational concepts (dominant maneuver, precision engagement, focused/just-in-time logistics, space-to-mud telecommunications, and <b>full</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>protection),</b> which are all dependent upon information superiority...|$|E
40|$|Joint Vision 2010 {{introduces}} the emerging operational concepts of Dominant Maneuver. Precision Engagement, Focused Logistics, and <b>Full</b> <b>Dimensional</b> <b>Protection</b> enabled by Information Superiority. Information Superiority is gained through operational architectures that closely couple {{the capabilities of}} sensors, C 2, and shooters. This architecture of future warfare {{can be characterized as}} Network Centric Warfare. The Navy's response to adapt and develop new operational concepts in support of Network Centric Warfare is Information Technology for the Twenty First Century (IT- 21). IT- 21 is a reprioritization of existing Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C 4 I) programs of record focused on accelerating the transition to a personal computer (PC) based tactical and support warfighting network. Battle Labs exist Service wide to aid in this growth process. Battle labs are focused organizations created to explore new technology, concepts, doctrine, or tactics, techniques and procedures to improve the efficiency and combat power of the forces. The Systems Technology Battle Lab was established to inject an academic viewpoint into experiments and research sponsored by the MBC and Commander, Third Fleet (COMTHIRDFLT). Currently, the documentation on the systems installed and how they work together to provide a centralized forum for experimentation and research is inadequate. The purpose of this thesis is to provide the STBL user with a guide describing the capabilities of the STBL and an example of its utilization in an integrated form. U. S. Navy (U. S.

40|$|Third Annual Acquisition Research SymposiumThe {{following}} {{article is}} taken as {{an excerpt from the}} proceedings of the annual Acquisition Research Program. This annual event showcases the research projects funded through the Acquisition Research Program at the Graduate School of Business and Public Policy at the Naval Postgraduate School. Featuring keynote speakers, plenary panels, multiple panel sessions, a student research poster show and social events, the Annual Acquisition Research Symposium offers a candid environment where high-ranking Department of Defense (DoD) officials, industry officials, accomplished faculty and military students are encouraged to collaborate on finding applicable solutions to the challenges facing acquisition policies and processes within the DoD today. By jointly and publicly questioning the norms of industry and academia, the resulting research benefits from myriad perspectives and collaborations which can identify better solutions and practices in acquisition, contract, financial, logistics and program management. For further information regarding the Acquisition Research Program, electronic copies of additional research, or to learn more about becoming a sponsor, please visit our program website at: www. acquisitionresearch. org. For further information on or to register for the next Acquisition Research Symposium during the third week of May, please visit our conference website at: www. researchsymposium. org.;To implement the capabilities conceptualized in Joint Vision 2020, complex, secure networks of weapon systems, intelligence platforms, and command and control mechanisms must be seamlessly integrated and maintained over time. Accurate and timely information will enable Joint Vision 2020 key tenets: Dominant Maneuver, Precision Engagement, Focused Logistics, and <b>Full</b> <b>Dimensional</b> <b>Protection.</b> These networks are central warfighting platforms in the information age. As these capabilities are developed over time in an evolutionary manner, interoperability on the Net-Centric Warfare (NCW) networks is essential, and both hardware and software systems must be designed in an Open-systems Architecture (OA) fashion to accommodate the vast number of changes anticipated. Professional Program Management will be needed to successfully develop these key warfighting platforms. Materiel Developers will need to recognize the relatively immature nature of the software engineering domains and actively compensate for this immaturity. System software performance capabilities must be much more detailed than typical hardware-centric systems, as the current state of software engineering disciplines is unlikely to satisfy implied, yet critical performance requirements. Essential OA performance characteristics including Maintainability, Upgradability, Interfaces/Interoperability, Reliability, Safety and Security (MUIRSS) must be fully analyzed and clearly communicated to the software developer to ensure the DoD obtains the flexibility and longevity desired from NCW systems...|$|E

In this paper we address the question of converting a surface triangulation to a subcomplex of the Delaunay triangulation with edge flips. We show that the surface triangulation which closely approximate a smooth surface with uniform density can be transformed to a Delaunay triangulation with a simple edge flip algorithm. The condition on uniformity becomes less stringent with increasing density of the triangulation. If the condition is dropped completely, the flip algorithm still terminates although the output surface triangulation becomes 'almost Delaunay' instead of exactly Delaunay...|$|R

In a unified framework, a brief review of alternative methods is provided and performance of the methods is appraised by means of a simulation study. The results of the joint dimension reduction and clustering methods are compared with cluster analysis based on the <b>full</b> <b>dimensional</b> data.

The general aim is to identify (via stochastic procedures) some qualitative or quantitative features of S, of geometric or topological character. The available information is just a random sample of points drawn on S. The term " to identify " means here to achieve a correct answer almost surely (a. s.) when the sample size tends to infinity.

Only partial results are available so far in current literature, under the assumption that the random set is either stationary, or it is a Boolean model, or it has convex grains.

40|$|Abstract — Many robot {{navigation}} tasks {{require the}} computation {{of the motion}} of multiple objects moving in 3 -D space from a collection of images taken by a moving robot. In this paper we present a unifying theoretical framework for both infinitesimal and discrete 3 -D motion segmentation from optical flow or point correspondences in multiple affine, perspective or central panoramic views. We exploit {{the fact that for}} these motion and camera models, the image measurements associated with a single object live in a low dimensional subspace of a high dimensional space, hence motion segmentation is achieved by segmenting data living in multiple subspaces. We solve this problem in closed form using a polynomial fitting and differentiation technique called Generalized Principal Component Analysis. Unlike previous work, our method does not restrict the motion of the objects to be <b>full</b> <b>dimensional</b> or fully independent. Instead, our approach deals gracefully with all the spectrum of possible motions: from low dimensional and partially dependent to <b>full</b> <b>dimensional</b> and fully independent.

The same dynamical problems, but treated with the MCTDH scheme and using a reduced dimensional ab initio MMVCH model, have been previously reported [S. Faraji, H. -D. Meyer, and H. Köppel, "Multistate vibronic interactions in difluorobenzene radical cations. II Quantum dynamical simulations," J. Chem. Phys. 129, 074311 (2008) ]. For easy comparison with the reduced dimensional results, 11 D or 10 D ML-MCTDH calculations are also performed. Extensive ML-MCTDH test calculations are performed to find appropriate ML-MCTDH wavefunction structures (ML-trees), and the convergence of the ML-MCTDH calculations are carefully checked to ensure accurate results. Based on the appropriate ML-trees, the photoelectron (PE) spectrum and the mass analyzed threshold ionization (MATI) spectrum are simulated, analyzed, and compared with corresponding experimental spectra. Because of its efficient simulation capability for large systems, ML-MCTDH calculations save a considerable amount of central processing unit (CPU) -time, even when a reduced dimensional MMVCH is used, i. e., the same reduced model as in the corresponding MCTDH calculations. Simulations of the experimental PE spectra by <b>full</b> <b>dimensional</b> ML-MCTDH calculations reproduced main peaks, which originate from different electronic states. The agreement is improved as compared to the reduced dimensionality calculations. Unfortunately, the experimental PE spectra are not very well resolved. Therefore, we compare our calculations additionally with highly resolved MATI spectra, which, however, are only available for the X̃ state. Based on a series of ML-MCTDH simulations with longer propagation time for X̃, a number of vibrational modes, including fundamentals, their combinations, and overtones are simulated and assigned by comparing with the experimental assignments and the ab initio frequencies. Excellent correlation between the experimental and <b>full</b> <b>dimensional</b> ML-MCTDH results show that ML-MCTDH is accurate and very efficient and that the ab initio MMVCH model is very suitable for ML-MCTDH calculations...|$|R
40|$|In {{polyhedral}} combinatorics one {{often has}} {{to analyze the}} facial structure of less than <b>full</b> <b>dimensional</b> polyhedra. The presence of implicit or explicit equations in the linear system defining such a polyhedron leads to technical difficulties when analyzing its facial structure. It is therefore customary to approach the study of such a polytope P through the study {{of one of its}} (<b>full</b> <b>dimensional)</b> relaxations (monotonizations) known as the submissive and the dominant of P. Finding sufficient conditions for an inequality that induces a facet of the submissive or the dominant of a polyhedron to also induce a facet of the polyhedron itself has been posed in the literature as an important research problem. Our paper goes a long way towards solving this problem. We address the problem in the framework of a generalized monotonization of a polyhedron P, g-mon (P), that subsumes both the submissive and the dominant, and give a sufficient condition for an inequality that defines a facet of g-mon(P) to define a facet of P. For the important cases of the traveling salesman (TS) polytope in both its symmetric and asymmetric variants, and of the linear ordering polytope, we give sufficient conditions trivially easy to verify, for a facet of the monotone completion to define a facet of the original polytope itself. ...|$|R

In [21], the joint FD self-backhaul and EH protocol for small cell networks with massive MIMO is investigated. In [49], SWIPT protocol for three-dimensional (3 D) massive MIMO system is designed, where the matched filter (MF) precoder is adopted at the BS. In [50], the SWIPT protocol is designed for multipair TWR system with massive MIMO, where the linear precoders, i.e., zero-forcing (ZF) and maximal ratio combining (MRC), are adopted at the relay. A low-complexity SWIPT scheme with retrodirective maximum ratio transmission (MRT) beamforming is studied in [51], where all energy receivers (ERs) send a common beacon signal simultaneously to the energy transmitter (ET) in the uplink and the ET simply conjugates and amplifies its received sum-signal and transmits to all ERs in the downlink for SWIPT.
