5|$|As rain {{continued}} to fall, the slightly acidic rainwater dissolved the limestone. As limestone wore away, the groundwater {{came into contact}} with the land surface and created a massive wetland ecosystem. Although the region appears flat, weathering of the limestone created slight valleys and plateaus in some areas. These plateaus rise and fall only a <b>few</b> <b>inches,</b> but on the subtle South Florida topography these small variations affect both the flow of water and the types of vegetation that can take hold.|$|E
5|$|In the 1923 season, {{under the}} eye of the county's coach, James Iremonger, Larwood {{concentrated}} on building his physique and on learning bowling skills. He grew a <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> in height, although he remained short for a fast bowler, and under Iremonger's regime of diet and exercise he gained weight. Besides his physical development, he learned by incessant practice various bowling arts, among them accuracy in line and length, variation of pace and grip, and deviating the ball in the air to produce swing. That year he played intermittently for the county's Second XI, and in a match against Lancashire Seconds took 8 wickets for 44 runs.|$|E
5|$|In the balkline games, {{rather than}} drawing balklines a <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> from the corners, the entire table {{is divided into}} {{rectangular}} balk spaces, by drawing balklines a certain distance lengthwise and widthwise across {{the length of the}} table a set number of inches parallel out from each rail. This divides the table into eight rectangular balkspaces. Additionally, rectangles are drawn where each balkline meets a rail, called anchor spaces, which developed to stop a number of nursing techniques that exploited the fact that if the object balls straddled a balkline, no count limit was in place.|$|E
5000|$|... 3D Helicopters are {{collective}} pitch and have very high head speeds and they {{range in size}} from a <b>few</b> <b>inch</b> blades to over 2 foot long blades. Some of the most popular sizes are 250, 300, 450, 500, 550, 600, 700.|$|R
5000|$|Each Abakan is {{made out}} of woven {{material}} using Abakanowicz's own technique. The material used for many of these pieces was found, often collecting sisal ropes from harbors, untwining them into threads and dying them. [...] Hung from the ceiling, Abakans reach sizes as large as thirteen feet with sometimes only a <b>few</b> <b>inch</b> clearance from the ground.|$|R

5|$|Mitchell Gourley {{was born}} in Geelong, Victoria, on 2 June 1991. He was born a {{congenital}} amputee, with his left forearm ending a <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> below his elbow. Mitchell can move the tiny stump of his forearm and uses it to hold and manipulate objects by gripping them in his elbow. He plays a variety of sports including cricket, Australian rules football, basketball, mountain biking and rock-climbing. He attended at Geelong College, and as of 2014 is studying commerce at the University of Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|Variants of {{the flame}} fougasse {{included}} the demigasse, a barrel on its side and left in the open with explosive buried underneath; and the hedge hopper: a barrel on end with explosive buried underneath a <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> deep and slightly off centre. On firing, the hedge hopper barrel was projected ten feet (3m) {{into the air and}} over a hedge or wall behind which it had been hidden. 50,000 flame fougasse barrels were installed at 7,000 sites mostly in southern England and at a further 2,000 sites in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Nevill {{was found}} in the kitchen, dressed in pyjamas, lying over an {{overturned}} chair next to the fireplace, amid a scene suggestive of a struggle. He had been shot eight times, six times to the head and face, fired when the rifle was a <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> from his skin. The remaining shots to his body had occurred from at least two feet away. Based on where the empty cartridges were found—three in the kitchen and one on the stairs—the police concluded that he had been shot four times upstairs, but had managed to get downstairs where a struggle took place, and during which he was hit several times with the rifle and shot again, this time fatally.|$|E

5|$|Shay {{was found}} dead in a Kansas City hotel room on December 1, 1927. He was found with a gunshot wound to the head. Police {{officials}} initially said that the manner of death could have been either suicide or murder. Shay stayed in his room on the day that he died. A porter went to check on him that evening and found him on the floor with a pistol a <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> from his right hand. When physicians examined Shay's body, they found that a bullet had entered the right ear and exited the back of the head. Shay had lost the use of his right arm and hand after a stroke. Police said that if Shay were holding the gun in his left hand, {{it would not have been}} easy for him to shoot himself in the right side of the head.|$|E
5|$|Stone {{found the}} short skirt {{convenient}} during her travels and defended it {{against those who}} {{said it was a}} distraction that hurt the women’s rights cause. Nevertheless, she disliked the instant attention it drew whenever she arrived in a new place. In the fall of 1854, she added a dress a <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> longer, for occasional use. In 1855, she abandoned the dress altogether and was not involved in the formation of a National Dress Reform Association in February, 1856. Her resumption of long skirts drew the condemnation of such dress-reform leaders as Gerrit Smith and Lydia Sayer Hasbrouk, who accused her of sacrificing principle for the sake of pleasing a husband.|$|E
5|$|Formerly, men {{not wearing}} {{military}} uniform wore knee breeches of an 18th-century design. Women's evening dress included trains and tiaras or feathers {{in their hair}} (or both). The dress code governing formal court uniform and dress has progressively relaxed. After World WarI, when Queen Mary wished to follow fashion by raising her skirts a <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> from the ground, she requested a lady-in-waiting to shorten her own skirt first to gauge the king's reaction. King GeorgeV was horrified, so the queen kept her hemline unfashionably low. Following their accession in 1936, King GeorgeVI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth, allowed the hemline of daytime skirts to rise. Today, there is no official dress code. Most men invited to Buckingham Palace in the daytime choose to wear service uniform or lounge suits; a minority wear morning coats, and in the evening, depending on the formality of the occasion, black tie or white tie.|$|E

25|$|Portland {{experiences}} a temperate climate with both oceanic and Mediterranean features. This climate {{is characterized by}} warm, dry summers and cool, rainy winters. The precipitation pattern is distinctly Mediterranean, with little to no rainfall occurring {{during the summer months}} {{and more than half of}} annual precipitation falling between November and February. Portland experiences somewhat cooler winters than areas of similar latitude on the west coast of Europe. Of the three most populated cities within the Pacific Northwest (Seattle, Vancouver and Portland) Portland has the warmest average temperature, the highest number of sunshine hours, and the <b>fewest</b> <b>inches</b> of rainfall and snowfall. According to the Köppen climate classification, Portland falls within the dry-summer mild temperate zone (Csb), also referred to as a warm-summer Mediterranean climate with a USDA Plant Hardiness Zones between 8b and 9a. Other climate systems, such as the Trewartha climate classification, places it within the oceanic zone (Do), like much of the Pacific Northwest and Western Europe.|$|R
5|$|On McGovern's December 15 mission over Linz, {{his second}} as pilot, {{a piece of}} {{shrapnel}} from flak came through the windshield and missed fatally wounding him by only a <b>few</b> <b>inches.</b> The following day {{on a mission to}} Brüx, he nearly collided with another bomber during close-formation flying in complete cloud cover. The following day, he was recommended for a medal after surviving a blown wheel on the always-dangerous B-24 take-off, completing a mission over Germany, and then landing without further damage to the plane. On a December 20 mission against the Škoda Works at Pilsen, Czechoslovakia, McGovern's plane had one engine out and another in flames after being hit by flak. Unable to return to Italy, McGovern flew to a British airfield on Vis, a small island in the Adriatic Sea off the Yugoslav coast that was controlled by Josip Broz Tito's Partisans. The short field, normally used by small fighter planes, was so unforgiving to four-engined aircraft that many of the bomber crews who tried to make emergency landings there perished. But McGovern successfully landed, saving his crew, a feat for which he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.|$|E
5|$|Sensors {{activate}} audible sirens near each {{entrance of}} the tunnel if a vehicle above the posted height attempts to enter the tunnel. Traffic signals at that entrance will turn red, stopping all traffic. The entrance will remain closed until the vehicle {{is removed from the}} freeway, sometimes causing severe delays for all traffic. CDOT noted that prior to the retrofit, about 20,000 vehicles per year tripped the alarm. The trucking industry argued that many of these trucks were under the height requirement but tripped the alarm due to their air suspensions (which can be lowered during their journey through the tunnel) or due to snow and ice atop the trailer. During this time, the trucking industry estimated the number of alarms would drop by as much as 80% if the clearance could be raised even a <b>few</b> <b>inches.</b> Another feature of the retrofit monitors truck weight—a safe speed for each truck on the 7% grades and curves just outside the tunnel is calculated and displayed for each driver.|$|E
5|$|As {{the tornado}} crossed South Richard Road, it {{intensified}} {{into a very}} high-end EF4 and inflicted catastrophic damage to several large homes as it impacted the Deer Creek subdivision. Well-built homes along South Richard Road and East Kuehl Court were leveled and swept from their foundations with debris strewn downwind. Several vehicles parked at these residences were moved some distance or tossed, and wind rowing of debris occurred. One house had its concrete walkway pulled a <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> from its original location, and notable scouring of lawn grass was observed in the subdivision. These structures were estimated to have been impacted by winds near 200mph (320km/h), the upper bound of an EF4 tornado. The homes swept away in this area were bolted to their foundations {{and there is some}} speculation that the tornado may have reached EF5 intensity at this point, though close inspection revealed that some of the washers were missing from the anchor bolts, and that low-lying shrubbery near the homes was left mostly intact, preventing a higher rating. Continuing northeast, the tornado temporarily weakened as it destroyed a few large barns or outbuildings, ripped the roof off two brick residences, and collapsed most walls of another house, but once again gained strength as it approached Illinois Route 64. A large restaurant and a residence had their exterior walls collapsed.|$|E

50|$|Compared {{with other}} saws {{designed}} for cutting curves, such as coping or fretsaws, compass saws {{have a larger}} blade and <b>fewer</b> teeth per <b>inch.</b> This allows them to cut more quickly, and to cut through thicker materials, but leaves a rougher finish.|$|R

25|$|First {{and second}} class coaches were unusual {{in that the}} sole bars and headstocks were below the axles. The line being for much of its length on a viaduct, this was a safety measure, since in a {{derailment}} the coaches would drop only a <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> onto the rails.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that ultrasound in the range emitted by bats causes flying moths to make evasive maneuvers because bats eat moths. Ultrasonic frequencies trigger a reflex action in the noctuid moth that causes it to drop a <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> in its flight to evade attack. Tiger moths also emit clicks which can foil bats' echolocation.|$|E
