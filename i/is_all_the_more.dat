5|$|Gott ist mein König is a {{significant}} early work of Bach. It differs from the other extant cantatas from Bach's time in Mühlhausen by its elaborate instrumentation. It was so positively received {{that it was the}} first of Bach's works to be printed (paid for by the city council); it is the only cantata to have been printed in his lifetime, at least in a version which has survived to this day. The printing <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> remarkable as Gott ist mein König appears to have been intended for not more than one repeat performance, and a new piece was commissioned the following year. Bach was commissioned to compose another cantata for the following year's council inauguration; there is evidence that the piece was composed and even printed, but no copies are known to survive.|$|E
25|$|According to Tim Maughan of Anime News Network, Redline was {{released}} {{several years later}} than originally planned. Its development took seven years and used 100,000 hand-made drawings, which Maughan notes <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> unusual as it is Koike's directorial debut.|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of a new Keynesian {{macroeconomic}} model, this paper studies the monetary policy that should be conducted by the common central bank of a monetary union. In the event of inflationary supply shocks, the optimal monetary policy should <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> contractionary as <b>the</b> inflation inertia increases, in order to obtain the same average price level. Moreover, the increase in interest rates should <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> accentuated as <b>the</b> shock affects a country which has a higher inflation inertia, and as the heterogeneity in inflation persistence between the countries of the monetary union increases. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
2500|$|The Sifra deduced from [...] that God {{occasionally}} began freestanding {{statements to}} Moses {{so as to}} allow Moses a pause to collect his thoughts.

50|$|Documents about a {{hitherto}} unknown mission {{which set}} out for Russia in 1859 {{has been found in}} the archives. These documents <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> interesting since they are connected with a most important event in India's 19th-century history, i.e., the great popular uprising against the colonialists in 1857-1859.|$|R
25|$|Sumerian {{metallurgy}} and goldsmithing {{were highly}} developed. This <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> remarkable for {{a region where}} metals had to be imported. Known metals included gold, gold, silver, copper, bronze, lead, electrum, and tin. The use of binary, tertiary and quaternary alloys were already in use during the Uruk period. Sumerians used bronze, although the scarcity of tin meant that they used arsenic instead. Metalworking techniques included lost-wax casting, plating, filigree, and granulation.|$|E
25|$|Advanced {{aerodynamics}} {{also contributed}} to the car's very low drag coefficient of 0.29– quite low even for modern cars. This accomplishment <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> remarkable considering the engineers did not enjoy the benefits of computer-aided design or wind tunnel testing. The original Elite drawings were by Peter Kirwan-Taylor. Frank Costin (brother of Mike, one of the co founders of Cosworth), at that time Chief Aerodynamic Engineer for the de Havilland Aircraft Company, contributed to the final design.|$|E
25|$|In fact, {{from the}} beginning, {{a sense of}} urgency gave the first Zionists the {{profound}} conviction that the task of reconquering the country had a solid moral basis. The argument of the Jews' historical right to the land was merely a matter of politics and propaganda. In view of the catastrophic situation of the Jews {{at the beginning of the}} century, the use of this argument was justified in every way, and it <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> legitimate because of the threat of death hanging over the Jews. Historical rights were invoked to serve the need of finding a refuge.|$|E
30|$|These results <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> {{significant}} in that reproducibility was good, or even excellent for both seniors and juniors. This {{leads to the}} assumption that any nuclear medicine physician with [18 F]fluorodeoxyglocose (FDG)/PET experience can interpret an [18 F]choline PET/CT examination just as efficiently, particularly for detecting sub-diaphragmatic lymphatic recurrences [5, 6].|$|R
30|$|These {{trade-offs}} <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> pertinent because livestock is {{the most}} important economic activity for the livelihoods of households studied here. Moreover, livestock represent a cultural dimension to pastoralism, beyond their economic value, which is harder to replace with tourism and conservation activities and goals that have a more Western value.|$|R
50|$|After {{its first}} season, MLS {{suffered}} from a decline in attendance. The league's low attendance <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> apparent {{in light of the}} fact that eight of the original ten teams began playing in stadiums owned or rented by American football teams, most of the venues with capacities of 60,000 or more.|$|R
25|$|In the {{relatively}} small and geographically dispersed Canadian market, magazines producing long-form journalism have often struggled to stay afloat. Saturday Night, which The Walrus editor John Macfarlane formerly published, lost money continuously despite being a celebrated publication. But as Macfarlane reports, The Walruss charitable model, {{similar to that of}} Harper's, is so far sustaining it: donations covered about half of the costs of producing the magazine in 2010, with the traditional revenue streams of circulation and advertising providing the rest. This <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> important for the magazine because its educational mandate requires that it keep a ratio of no less than 70 percent editorial content to 30 percent advertising.|$|E
25|$|Absent the use {{of trade}} to access resources, {{economic}} transactions were essentially intra-lineage obligations of labor. These lineages required a base level of self-sufficiency to achieve autarky. In the Andes, a long mountain range with {{a great variety of}} ecozones and resources, the need to access the proper lands for specific crops or animals meant lineages created miniature colonies or sent seasonal migration (such as transhumance) in different ecoregions. As the Andes are a relatively young mountain range, there is an especially great variation in waterfall and temperature, which has great importance for agriculture. This <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> important as only about 2% of the land in the Andes is arable.|$|E
25|$|Although it is {{fashionable to}} blame all of Asia's present {{problems}} on corruption {{and the failure}} of Asian values, it is at bottom a case of a bubble bursting, of too many imprudent lenders chasing too many incautious borrowers. But the greed of Mr. Suharto's children ensured that their father would take the lion's share of the blame for Indonesia's financial collapse. The Suharto children's favored position became a major obstacle to the measures needed to restore economic confidence. Worst of all, they ensured that the economic crisis would be a political crisis as well. That he allowed this, and that he amassed such wealth himself, <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> mysterious since he lived a relatively modest life.|$|E
50|$|He got eight goals at Sydney after {{handsome}} {{display at}} Osaka's Olympic qualifiers.

His total goals in 2000 were 26, followed by 37 in 2001.|$|R
5|$|The {{foundation}} of the Fourth International was therefore spurred {{in part by a}} desire to form a stronger political current, rather than being seen as the communist opposition to the Comintern and the Soviet Union.

25|$|Roughly {{half of the}} university's {{students}} {{volunteer in}} community-service programs in neighborhoods around campus and throughout Los Angeles. These outreach programs, as well as previous administrations' commitment to remaining in South Los Angeles amid widespread calls to move the campus following the 1965 Watts Riots, are credited {{for the safety of}} the university during the 1992 Los Angeles Riots. (That the university emerged from the riots completely unscathed <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> remarkable in light of the complete destruction of several strip malls in the area, including one just across Vermont Avenue from the campus's western security fence.) The ZIP code for USC is 90089 and the surrounding University Park community is 90007.|$|E
25|$|The seventh {{edition of}} Yudh Abhyas is {{currently}} underway since 5 March 2012 in two locations under the South Western Command. The US Army contingent {{is from the}} US Army Pacific (USARPAC), part of the United States Pacific Command (USPACOM). The Command Post Exercise has an engineer brigade headquarters with its planners from both sides, while the Field Training Exercise comprises troops of the 2nd Squadron 14th US Cavalry Regiment from the 25th Infantry Division, Hawaii, along with a platoon of Strykers, and a similar sized Indian Army contingent of mechanised infantry. The event <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> interesting {{as a number of}} key surveillance, communications and Improvised Explosive Devices detection and neutralisation technologies, available to both sides have been fielded in the exercise.|$|E
25|$|On 4 April 2011, Gleeson {{was named}} {{the winner of the}} Lindsay Gaze Trophy as the Coach of the Year for the 2010/11 season. Gleeson led his Townsville Crocodiles team to an {{impressive}} 17–11 record in 2010/11, which was the second-best win-loss ratio in the league. That <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> remarkable as a pre-season poll of the NBL coaches didn't even tip the Crocs to finish in the top four. Gleeson inspired his team to the best home record in the NBL, as the Crocs lost just one of their 14 games at 'The Swamp' during the season. That equalled the club's most number of home wins in a regular season ever. He also engineered a Crocs defence that limited opponents to the second lowest number of points of any team in the NBL.|$|E

40|$|Globalization and globality are in {{the light}} of Masaryk's thought {{phenomena}} understandable from democratical and non-ideological points of view.

25|$|The {{fact that}} UG plays an {{essential}} role in normal child language acquisition is evident from species differences: for example, children and household pets may be exposed to quite similar linguistic input, but by the age of three years, the child's ability to comprehend multi-word utterances vastly outstrips that of the dog or cat. This evidence <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> impressive when one considers that most children do not receive reliable correction for grammatical errors. Indeed, even children who for medical reasons cannot produce speech, and therefore have no possibility of producing an error in the first place, have been found to master both the lexicon and the grammar of their community's language perfectly. The fact that children succeed at language acquisition even when their linguistic input is severely impoverished, as it is when no corrective feedback is available, is known as the argument from the poverty of the stimulus, and is another important source of empirical support for a central role of UG in child language acquisition.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{a comment}} by Pausanias, who compares {{sacrificial}} practice in Olympia {{with that in}} Pergamon, {{this is the only}} written reference to the altar in all of antiquity. This <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> surprising because the writers of antiquity otherwise wrote a great deal about such works of art and Ampelius, after all, considered the altar {{to be one of the}} wonders of the world. The absence of written sources from antiquity about the altar has given rise to a number of interpretations. One possibility is that the Romans did not regard this Hellenistic altar as important since it did not date from the classic epoch of Greek, especially Attic, art. Only this art and later evocation of the associated values were considered significant and worth mentioning. This view was held particularly by German researchers starting in the 18th century, especially after the work of Johann Joachim Winckelmann became known. The only graphic representations of the altar are on coins of the Roman Empire, which show the altar in a stylized form.|$|E
500|$|Following Native Son, Baker had a {{critically}} acclaimed lead {{role as the}} wife of a schizophrenic drifter (played by Jack Nicholson) in Ironweed (1987), alongside Meryl Streep. Her performance in the film was again praised by Roger Ebert, who said: [...] "Nicholson's homecoming [...] <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> effective because Carroll Baker is so good as his wife... she finds a whole new range.
