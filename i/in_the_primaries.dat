5|$|Kennedy {{fought it}} out with McCarthy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>primaries,</b> as Humphrey used {{favorite}} son stand-ins to help him win delegates to the Democratic National Convention. Kennedy was assassinated, leaving Humphrey as McCarthy's main challenger. But Humphrey's organization was too strong for McCarthy to overcome, and his anti-war campaign was split after the late entrance of Senator George McGovern of South Dakota {{just ahead of the}} Democratic National Convention. Despite winning the popular vote, McCarthy lost to Humphrey at the convention amidst protests and riots.|$|E

50|$|In 1924, Nashville Banner {{publisher}} E.B. Stahlman, {{an opponent}} of Governor Peay, recruited Neal to oppose Peay <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gubernatorial <b>primary,</b> but Peay won easily. In 1930, Neal ran for U.S. senator, but lost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> to William Brock. He again ran for <b>the</b> senate <b>in</b> 1934, but was defeated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> by Kenneth McKellar. In 1944, Neal ran for governor, but lost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> to Jim Nance McCord. Two years later, he ran for both governor and senator, and when he lost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>in</b> each election, he ran as an independent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> general election. Neal's last campaign was in 1954, {{when he ran for}} governor against Frank G. Clement.|$|R
5|$|Reporters deemed Harding {{unlikely}} to be nominated due to his poor showing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>primaries,</b> and relegated him to a place among the dark horses. Harding, who like the other candidates was in Chicago supervising his campaign, had finished sixth in the final public opinion poll, behind the three main candidates as well as former justice Hughes and Herbert Hoover, and only slightly ahead of Coolidge.|$|E
5|$|The Pact of Olivos {{diminished the}} electoral {{strength}} of the UCR, leading {{to the rise of}} the Frepaso. Both parties united in a political coalition, the Alliance, which defeated the PJ in the 1997 midterm elections. It was the PJ's first national defeat since 1985. The parties held open primary elections for the 1999 presidential elections. De la Rúa stood for the UCR; the whole party, including Alfonsín, supported him. The Frepaso candidate was Graciela Fernández Meijide, who had defeated Peronism in the populous Buenos Aires province. De la Rúa won the primary elections by a wide margin. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>primaries,</b> De la Rúa was voted for by more people than those who voted for the UCR in 1995. Despite his victory, Alfonsín was still the president of the UCR. They disagreed on the vice president for De la Rúa's ticket; he thought that it should be Meijide because she took part in the primary elections and came from a different district than him. Alfonsín preferred the popular Carlos Álvarez, leader of the Frepaso, saying he could attract more voters and had more political expertise. It was also a result of the internal politics of the Alliance: except for Meijide, the Frepaso did not have a political figure who may run with good chances for governor of the Buenos Aires province. Had she run for vicepresident, Frepaso would have had to resign that candidacy to a radical candidate.|$|E

50|$|In 2009, Republican Assemblyman John E. Rooney {{decided not}} to run for a fifteenth term. Schroeder and former River Edge Councilman John Felice both sought the {{endorsement}} of the Northeastern Republican Organization, which would determine who won <b>the</b> party line <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary.</b> <b>The</b> NERO overwhelmingly supported Schroeder over Felice, thus giving him <b>the</b> party line <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary,</b> along with incumbent Assemblywoman Charlotte Vandervalk.

25|$|After 1968, {{the only}} way to win the party's presidential {{nomination}} became through the primary process; Humphrey {{turned out to be the}} last nominee of either major party to win his party's nomination without having directly competed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>primaries.</b>|$|E
25|$|Shreve {{fell from}} {{favor with the}} Republicans, who {{promoted}} attorney Robert Firman as their candidate in the April 1920 primaries.

25|$|Kennedy, {{like his}} brother before him, planned {{to win the}} {{nomination}} through popular support <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>primaries.</b> McCarthy and Kennedy squared off in California, each knowing that the state would make or break them.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>primary</b> {{dentition}} is {{an important}} indicator of the permanent dentition.

40|$|Children who {{present with}} a {{posterior}} cross-bite <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> dentition may be predisposed to long-term detrimental consequences if {{the condition is}} left untreated. Controversy exists <b>in</b> <b>the</b> literature as to the most appropriate time to treat this condition. Objectives. The aim of this review is to evaluate the need for correcting posterior cross-bites <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> dentition based on the current understanding of the aetiology, likelihood of self-correction, and consequences of various forms of this malocclusion persisting into the mixed and permanent dentitions. A review of the reported treatment options for management of this condition is also presented. Methods. Literature pertaining to the epidemiology and management of posterior cross-bites <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> dentition are reviewed. Conclusion. Posterior cross-bites <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> dentition are relatively common and their causes are numerous. Because {{a significant proportion of}} posterior cross-bites self-correct beyond <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> dentition, routine correction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> dentition phase cannot be advocated. A unilateral posterior cross-bite {{as a result of a}} functional displacement of the mandible is one of the few malocclusions which should be considered for correction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> dentition. Further research is needed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> management of this condition...|$|R

25|$|Gore easily {{defeated}} Bradley <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>primaries,</b> {{largely because}} {{of support from the}} Democratic Party establishment and Bradley's poor showing in the Iowa caucus, where Gore successfully painted Bradley as aloof and indifferent to the plight of farmers.

However, in the non-binding Washington, D.C. primary, Kucinich finished fourth (last out of candidates listed on the ballot), with only 8% of the vote.
