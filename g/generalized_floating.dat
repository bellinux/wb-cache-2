It linked to the U.S. dollar by fixing the amount of gram of gold per baht as well as the baht per U.S. dollar. Over {{the course of the next}} 15 years, the Thai government decided to depreciate the baht in terms of gold three times, yet maintain the parity of the baht against the U.S. dollar. Due to the introduction of a new <b>generalized</b> <b>floating</b> exchange rate system by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that stretched a smaller role of gold in the international monetary system in 1978, this fixed parity system as a monetary co-operation policy was terminated. The Thai government amended its monetary policies to be more in line with the new IMF policy.|$|E

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} of exchange rate over shooting is investigated {{in the context}} of a model that incorporates activist monetary policy, variable output, imperfect capital mobility, and slow price adjustment. Monetary policy which accommodates prices and/or interest rates is shown to increase the likelihood of undershooting. Using constrained maximum likelihood methods,the model is estimated for Germany and Japan since the advent of <b>generalized</b> <b>floating</b> in 1973. Based on the estimated parameter values, the mark exhibits overshooting while the yen is characterized by undershooting. The constraints implied by the model cannot (by likelihood ratio tests) be rejected at standard significance levels for either country. ...|$|E
40|$|After {{a decade}} of <b>generalized</b> <b>floating,</b> {{it is clear that}} {{bilateral}} exchange rates exhibit more variability than the economic aggregates; relative prices, incomes, and money supplies, that generally comprise the fundamentals of theories of exchange rate determination. Dornbush's over-shooting hypothesis is the best known explanation of this phenomenon. This paper shows that accommodative monetary policy (with respect to prices) has the potential to cause the economy to switch from exchange rate overshooting to undershooting. Using constrained maximum likelihood methods, the model is estimated for Germany and the United States. The results provide strong evidence in support of the overshooting hypothesis for the Deutsche Mark/Dollar exchange rate. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we obtain and {{interpret}} new {{estimates of the}} short- and long-run influence of exchange-rate volatility (or risk) on the import flows of the United States, in the <b>generalized</b> <b>floating</b> exchange-rate period. The major finding {{is that there is}} a significant long-run negative effect of exchange-rate volatility on the volume of imports, as well as, a significant short-run negative effect. Therefore, it can be argued that exchange-rate volatility will have significant effects on the allocation of resources by market participants and that policy-makers can no longer rely on an import demand with only conventional variables for long-term international trade planning, forecasting and policy formulation.

40|$|The {{volatility}} of {{flexible exchange rates}} greatly exceeds what most analysts anticipated at the advent of <b>generalized</b> <b>floating.</b> The Dornbusch overshooting model accounts {{for the fact that}} exchange rates fluctuate more than the underlying fundamentals. This paper presents a model which may help account for why exchange rates have been even more volatile than the overshooting model would suggest, and why trade prices have been so unresponsive in recent years. The paper employs an extended version of the sticky-price monetary model of exchange rates and a simple industrial organization model of import pricing. The combined macro-JO. model shows that exchange rate volatility and unresponsive trade prices can be mutually amplifying. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper assesses U. S. foreign-exchange {{intervention}} {{since the}} inception of <b>generalized</b> <b>floating.</b> We find that intervention was by and large ineffectual. We first identify which interventions were successful according to three criteria. Then, we test whether the number of observed successes significantly exceeds the amount that would randomly occur given the near-martingale nature of daily exchange-rate changes. Finally, we investigate whether the various characteristics of an intervention - its size, frequency, or coordination - can increase the probability of success. We find that intervention did tend to moderate same-day exchange-rate movements relative to the previous day, but this effect is not robust across subperiods or currencies and it occurs infrequently. Increasing the size of an intervention increases the probability of success, but no other variable consistently makes a difference, including coordinating interventions with other central banks.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between the new monetary control procedures, implemented by the Federal Reserve Board in October 1979, and the subsequent increase in exchange rate variability for the United States. It shows that, {{in the context of a}} stochastic, rational expectations model,exchange rate variability minimizing monetary policy is identical to the policy which, in a deterministic, perfect foresight model, would place the economy on the borderline between exchange rate overshooting and undershooting. The model is estimated for the United States since <b>generalized</b> <b>floating</b> began in 1973. The new monetary control procedures have had two opposite effects. Monetary policy has become less accommodative, increasing exchange rate variability through overshooting. On the other hand,systematic deviations from uncovered interest rate parity, which can be attributed to exchange risk, have also increased. These increase exchange rate variability through undershooting. It is shown that the latter dominate the former, providing an explanation of increased exchange rate variability consistent with undershooting, not with overshooting. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{symposium}} {{is being}} called {{at a time when}} there is great concern about the floating exchange rate system in general and the foreign exchange value of the dollar in particular. Since the early 1970 s, with the Smithsonian Agreement in late 1971 and the move to <b>generalized</b> <b>floating</b> in early 1973, news about exchange rate developments and events that might affect the path of exchange rates have become a staple in the diet of national policyma-kers and business executives.

40|$|Discussions {{involving}} {{the system of}} generalized currency floating as this relates to the less developed countries (LDC's) have two aspectsl namely: (1) the effects on LDC economies of the adoption of more flexlble exchange rates by industrialized countries; and (2) the implications of exchange rate flexibility in LDCts themselves. I This paper deals primarily with the second issue, it attempts to evaluate, no doubt in a limited manners the exchange experience of the Philipplnes {{during the period of}} <b>generalized</b> <b>floating</b> of major currencies. Section i provides a brief historical perspective on the 1970 exchange rate reform. Section 2 describes and analyzes the post- 1970 exchange rate system, highlighting some of the country's structural characteristics which can help explain its choice of ezchange rate regime. Changes in the nominal peso-dollar exchange rate are examined, and speculative pressures during the period of greater exchange rate flexibility are compared to those during the earlier period of adjustable par values.

40|$|Since {{the move}} to <b>generalized</b> <b>floating</b> in 1973, {{exchange}} rates between major currencies have displayed large fluctuations. This turbulence of foreign exchange rates is an important concern of government policy and its explanation is a challenge for theories of foreign exchange market behavior. In Section I of this paper, we document the extent of turbulence in foreign exchange markets by examining (i) the magnitude of short-run variations in exchange rates relative to other measures of economic variability; (ii) the degree of divergence between actual and expected changes in exchange rates; and (iii) {{the extent to which}} exchange-rate movements have diverged from movements of relative national price levels. In Section II, we provide a general explanation of this turbulence in terms of the modern "asset market theory" to exchange-rate determination. This theory emphasizes that exchange rates, like the prices of other assets determined in organized markets, are strongly influenced by the market's expectation of future events. In this context, we also discuss the narrower technical question of "foreign exchange market efficiency. " Finally, in Section III, we address the question of whether turbulence in the foreign exchange markets has been "excessive" and what policy measures can (or should) be taken to reduce it. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between exchange rates and trade {{has long been}} controversial. The fixed exchange rates of the pre- 1914 gold standard were viewed as essential for efficient trade. In the period of 1919 – 39, exchange rate flexibility {{was positively correlated with}} growth, and too rigid adherence to the gold standard was negatively correlated with growth (Eichengreen 1992). However, beggar-thy-neighbor policies of devaluing in order to reduce unemployment in the 1930 s came {{to be seen as a}} zero-sum strategy that exacerbated the breakdown of the global economy. In the Bretton Woods era the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was responsible for ensuring that countries maintained fixed exchange rates and that any devaluation or revaluation was orderly. Since the advent of <b>generalized</b> <b>floating</b> in the 1970 s, no multilateral organization has been responsible for the global exchange rate system. There have been recurring charges of countries using exchange rate protectionism or promoting exports by exchange rate undervaluation. At the same time, the global trading system is increasingly characterized by proliferation of regional trade agreements which, together with World Trade Organization commitments, limit governments’ ability to use traditional trade policy measures (WTO 2011), and may increase the attractiveness of using the exchange rate as a trade policy instrument. The aim of this chapter is to examine the {{relationship between}} the exchange rate regime and exchange rate volatility and trade among countries in an RTA. Victor Pontines and Richard Pomfre...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{collapse}} of the Bretton Woods system, concern about the relationship between exchange rate variability and volume of trade has grown. ^ The main {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate empirically whether exchange rate variability affected the trade volumes of Canada, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom during the <b>generalized</b> <b>floating</b> exchange rate regime. ^ The study analyzes the behavior of a trading firm facing exchange rate uncertainty and takes into account the adverse impact of exchange rate variability on the volume of trade. The study also explains the concepts and the causes of exchange rate variability and develops four models to measure exchange rate variability. The purpose of these models is to ensure the reliability of results. This study specifies export and import equations for empirical tests by using new explanatory variables, which include the effects of price, income, and exchange rates from the third countries. ^ This study has conducted a variety of empirical tests: estimates of the effects of exchange rate variability on aggregate, bilateral, and sectoral volumes of trade. In particular, this study investigated the differences in the sensitivities of exports and imports of selected economic sectors to the exchange rate variability. ^ Although many previous empirical works have failed to extract the adverse relationship between the exchange rate variability and the volume of trade, this study successfully shows that the exchange rate variability has adversely and significantly affected the volume of trade of three sample countries. ...|$|E
40|$|Prominent among {{competing}} {{explanations of}} ex-change rate determination in a regime of floating exchange rates {{is the so-called}} monetary approach, which holds that the exchange rate between two na-tional currencies is determined by current and pro-spective relative supplies of and demands for those national money stocks. This theory has a long tradi-tion going back more than 300 years. As {{an integral part of}} pre-Keynesian international monetary theory, it formed the central analytical core of classical and neoclassical explanations of exchange rate behavior. Although it was temporarily eclipsed by the rival elasticities and foreign trade multiplier or income-expenditure approaches that gained popularity with the domination of the Keynesian revolution, it has recently made a comeback and today is widely em-ployed by academic and business economists to ex-plain the behavior of exchange rates in the post-Bretton Woods era of <b>generalized</b> <b>floating.</b> For example, such well-known economists as Robert Barro, John Bilson, Jacob Frenkel, and Michael Mussa have successfully employed the monetary ap-proach to account for recent exchange rate experi-ence, as have analysts at Citibank, Chase Manhattan, and other financial institutions. Finally, {{it is worth noting that}} certain segments of the financial press, notably the editorial pages of the Wall Street Journal, regularly espouse the monetary approach. Corresponding to the growing popularity of the monetary approach has been an accompanying inter-est in its historical antecedents. Accordingly, in the past few years Jacob Frenkel, Johan Myhrman, and Mordechai Kreinin and Lawrence Officer, respec-tively, have published papers dealing with the doc-trinal development of that approach. 1 These papers, however, suffer from one serious omission. For while they cite several prominent economists writing in the 1920 s-notably Cassel, Gregory, Hawtrey, and Keynes-as important early proponents of the mone-tary approach, they say nothing about the great Brit-ish economist Dennis Robertson.

40|$|Although {{there exists}} a large volume of {{literature}} on the {{theory and practice of}} LDC exchange rate regimes in the post-Bretton Woods era, it is mostly of a general nature treating LDCs as a whole. There are very few studies which examine in depth the special features of individual exchange rate regimes. Moreover, the issue of exchange rate instability that characterized the <b>generalized</b> <b>floating</b> of world's major currencies since the early 1970 s, has so far received only superficial treatments as far as LDCs are concerned. The thesis attempts to fill these gaps by examining the Indian case in detail. An exchange rate policy in fact has two aspects. First, it involves the establishment of an optimal exchange rate regime which lays the framework for the day-to-day determination of the nominal exchange rate. Second, the exchange rate policy is concerned with the operation of the exchange rate regime {{in such a way as}} to promote given policy objectives. In the context of <b>generalized</b> <b>floating,</b> the decision regarding exchange rate regime for an LDC has to be made on the grounds of `internal balance', i. e. with a view to protecting the domestic economy from disturbances arising from day-to-day third world currency fluctuations. This would require a multi-currency peg based on balance of trade elasticities. Once an exchange rate regime is established, it has to be managed on considerations of `external balance'. This in turn would require adjustments in the value of the peg, either to compensate for the inflation differential between the home country and its trading partners, or in order to bring about a balance of payments adjustment. India adopted a basket peg since September 1975. However, India's basket system does not appear to be optimal, firstly because of the major role given in it to sterling as the currency of intervention, designation and valuation, and more importantly, because the official currency basket does not seem to be representative enough and also is not based on elasticity weights. Concerning the management of the basket peg, it appears that the authorities have been guided by a number of alternative considerations which came into conflict with the objective of external balance. Particularly, considerations such as the minimization of speculation and inflation, and the stabilization of the rupee-dollar rate seemed to have considerably influenced India's exchange rate policy. An important result of the promotion of the above alternative objectives has been high exchange rate volatility. Exchange rate instability depresses trade by generating exchange risk. In the context of LDCs with quantitative restrictions on private imports and direct government imports, the impact of exchange risk is felt much more on exports than imports. Previous studies on the impact of exchange rate instability on LDC exports have suffered from specification mistakes of export functions as well as inaccuracy of the exchange risk proxies employed. We developed a fully specified exchange risk-augmented demand-supply model of exports for India. We used this model to estimate the impact of changes in exchange rate and exchange risk on exports in the aggregate as well as for the two disaggregated groups, namely, manufactured and non-fuel primary products. The separate effects on the volume and price of exports were estimated. We also demonstrated that the signs of the exchange risk elasticity coefficients in export price equations are consistent with the invoicing pattern of India's exports. We simulated the results of the export model under reasonable assumptions for the medium term, and demonstrated the possibility of much gains on current account through a policy of reducing exchange rate instability in real terms. They also tend to show that an equilibrium exchange rate cannot be defined independent of the short-term fluctuations of the exchange rate. The results of the study have profound implications also for other LDCs which are subject to chronic balance payment deficits...|$|E
40|$|The {{breakdown}} of the Bretton Woods system and the adoption of <b>generalized</b> <b>floating</b> exchange rates ushered {{in a new era}} of exchange rate volatility and uncertainty. This increased volatility led economists to search for economic models able to describe observed exchange rate behaviour. In chapter 2 we propose more general STAR transition functions which encompass both threshold non-linearity and asymmetric effects. Our framework allows for a gradual adjustment from one regime to another, and considers threshold effects by encompassing other existing models, such as TAR models. We apply our methodology to three different exchange rate data-sets, one for developing countries, and official nominal exchange rates, the second emerging market economies using black market exchange rates and the third for OECD economies. The large appreciation and depreciation of the dollar in the 1980 s stimulate an exciting academic debate on using unit root tests for structural break. We propose a model which is the natural extension of the behavioural equilibrium exchange rate (BEER) model. We then propose more general smooth transition (STR) functions, which are able to capture structural changes along the equilibrium path, and are consistent with our economic model. Our framework allows for a gradual adjustment between regimes and considers under- and/or over-valued exchange rate adjustment. We apply our methodology to the monthly and quarterly nominal exchange rates for seventeen and twenty OECD economies and construct bilateral CPI-based real exchange rates against the U. S. dollar and the German mark. The investigation of chapter 4 focuses on non-linear forecasts to testing exchange rate models by examining microstructure - order flow. The basic hypothesis is that if order flow includes heterogeneous beliefs and the information contained in them, heterogenous customer order flow can have forecasting power for exchange rates. Using statistical and economic evaluation, we quantify the role that, when the information is lagged or simultaneously released to all market participants, the key micro level price determinants - order flows is impounded into price. The results indicate: 1) order flow with non-linear consideration lead to considerable and statistically significant improvements compared to the random walk model; and 2) order flow is a powerful predictor of the exchange rate movement in an out-of-sample exercise, on the basis of economic value criteria such as Sharpe ratio and performance fees implied by utility calculations...|$|E
