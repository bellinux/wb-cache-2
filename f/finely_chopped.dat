5|$|The most ideal {{food was}} that which most closely matched the humour of human beings, i.e. {{moderately}} warm and moist. Food should preferably also be <b>finely</b> <b>chopped,</b> ground, pounded and strained {{to achieve a}} true mixture of all the ingredients. White wine {{was believed to be}} cooler than red and the same distinction was applied to red and white vinegar. Milk was moderately warm and moist, but the milk of different animals was often believed to differ. Egg yolks were considered to be warm and moist while the whites were cold and moist. Skilled cooks were expected to conform to the regimen of humoral medicine. Even if this limited the combinations of food they could prepare, there was still ample room for artistic variation by the chef.|$|E

Kroeung is {{traditionally}} made by <b>finely</b> <b>chopping</b> the ingredients and grinding them together using a heavy mortar and pestle although mechanical food processors can be used in modern kitchens. The resulting paste is similar in form and function to Thai curry pastes. Various ingredients, depending on the dish and the taste of the cook, can be pounded into kroeung. The eight most commonly used are Lemon grass, Magrut lime zest and leaves, Galangal, Turmeric, Garlic, Shallots, Dried Red Chillies and various Rhizomes (Lesser Galangal, Boesenbergia rotunda (ខ្ជាយ), Kaempferia galanga, etc.).This herbal paste is essential for preparing Khmer dishes in order to create the authentic flavour.|$|R
50|$|Edible {{rendering}} {{processes are}} basically meat processing operations and produce lard or edible tallow {{for use in}} food products. Edible rendering is generally carried out in a continuous process at low temperature (less than the boiling point of water). The process usually consists of <b>finely</b> <b>chopping</b> the edible fat materials (generally fat trimmings from meat cuts), heating them with or without added steam, and then carrying out two or more stages of centrifugal separation. The first stage separates the liquid water and fat mixture from the solids. The second stage further separates the fat from the water. The solids {{may be used in}} food products, pet foods, etc., depending on the original materials. The separated fat may be used in food products, or if in surplus, may be diverted to soap making operations. Most edible rendering is done by meat packing or processing companies.|$|R

50|$|For 700 g of fish, <b>finely</b> <b>chop</b> {{an onion}} and saute it with oil, parsley, and two whole cloves of garlic. The moment the onion starts to brown, add 300 g of chopped from {{tomatoes}} or tomato paste, {{and season with}} salt and pepper. When the tomatoes are cooked, pour in one finger of strong vinegar or two fingers of weak vinegar, diluted in a large glass of water. Let boil for a few more minutes, then discard the garlic and strain the rest of the ingredients, pressing hard against the mesh. Put the strained sauce back on the fire along with whatever fish you may have on hand, including sole, red mullet, gurnard, dogfish, mantis shrimp, and other types of fish in season, leaving the small fish whole and cutting the big ones into small pieces. Taste for seasoning; but in any case it is not a bad idea to add a little olive oil, since the amount of soffritto was quite small. When the fish is cooked, the cacciucco is usually brought to the table on two separate platters: on one you place the fish, strained from the broth, and on the other you arrange enough finger-thick slices of bread to soak up all the broth.|$|R
5000|$|Materials {{that for}} {{aesthetic}} or sanitary reasons are {{not suitable for}} human food are the feedstocks for inedible rendering processes. Much of the inedible raw material is rendered using the [...] "dry" [...] method. This may be a batch or a continuous {{process in which the}} material is heated in a steam-jacketed vessel to drive off the moisture and simultaneously release the fat from the fat cells. The material is first ground, then heated to release the fat and drive off the moisture, percolated to drain off the free fat, and then more fat is pressed out of the solids, which at this stage are called [...] "cracklings" [...] or [...] "dry-rendered tankage". The cracklings are further ground to make meat and bone meal. A variation on a dry process involves <b>finely</b> <b>chopping</b> the material, fluidizing it with hot fat, and then evaporating the mixture in one or more evaporator stages. Some inedible rendering is done using a wet process, which is generally a continuous process similar in some ways to that used for edible materials. The material is heated with added steam and then pressed to remove a water-fat mixture which is then separated into fat, water and fine solids by stages of centrifuging and/or evaporation. The solids from the press are dried and then ground into meat and bone meal. Most independent renderers process only inedible material.|$|R
50|$|Bäliş is {{the oldest}} {{traditional}} dish combining meat and grains.

25|$|Meat is {{generally}} eaten cooked, but many recipes call for raw beef, veal or fish (tartare). Steak tartare is a meat dish made from <b>finely</b> <b>chopped</b> or minced raw beef or horse meat. Meat is often spiced or seasoned, particularly with meat {{products such as}} sausages. Meat dishes are usually described by their source (animal and part of body) and method of preparation (e.g., a beef rib).|$|E
25|$|Two common {{spaghetti}} dishes {{served in}} Japan are the Bolognese and the Napolitan. In Nepal, macaroni {{has been adopted}} and cooked in a Nepalese way. Boiled macaroni is sautéed along with cumin, turmeric, <b>finely</b> <b>chopped</b> green chillies, onions and cabbage. In Greece hilopittes {{is considered one of}} the finest types of dried egg pasta. It is cooked either in tomato sauce or with various kinds of casserole meat.

25|$|Another worth-mentioning specialty, {{also common}} to most villages in {{southern}} area of Chieti's province, is the ventricina, a usually round-shaped salami made of fresh pork <b>finely</b> <b>chopped</b> and mingled {{with bits of}} lard, ground dried red medium-spicy peppers, fennel seeds, and coarse salt, usually prepared during the colder winter days of January (after the first snow falls it is tradition to slaughter a pig), then hanged on the ceiling in a dry room and seasoned for usually 1+ months until ready to be sliced and served with freshly baked bread as an appetizer.

25|$|When used as feed for dairy cattle, alfalfa {{is often}} made into haylage {{by a process}} known as ensiling. Rather than being dried to make dry hay, the alfalfa is <b>chopped</b> <b>finely</b> and {{fermented}} in silos, trenches, or bags, where the oxygen supply can be limited to promote fermentation. The anaerobic fermentation of alfalfa allows it to retain high nutrient levels similar to those of fresh forage, and is also more palatable to dairy cattle than dry hay. In many cases, alfalfa silage is inoculated with different strains of microorganisms to improve the fermentation quality and aerobic stability of the silage.|$|R
