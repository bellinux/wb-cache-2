40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare purebred Duroc and Pietrain prenatal muscle tissue transcriptome expression levels at different stages of prenatal development to gain insight into the differences in muscle tissue development in these pig breeds. Commercial western pig breeds have been selected for muscle growth for the past 2 decades. Pig breeds differ for their muscle phenotypes (i. e., myofiber numbers and myofiber types). <b>Duroc</b> and Pietrain <b>pig</b> breeds are extremes; <b>Duroc</b> <b>pigs</b> have redder muscle fiber types with more intramuscular fat, and Pietrain pigs have faster-growing and whiter muscle fiber types. Pietrain pigs are more muscular than <b>Duroc</b> <b>pigs,</b> whereas <b>Duroc</b> <b>pigs</b> are fatter than Pietrain pigs. The genomic background underlying these breed-specific differences is poorly known. Myogenesis is a complex exclusive prenatal process involving proliferation and differentiation (i. e., fusion) of precursor cells called myoblasts. We investigated the difference in the prenatal muscle-specific transcriptome profiles of <b>Duroc</b> and Pietrain <b>pigs</b> using microarray technology. The microarray contained more than 500 genes affecting myogenesis, energy metabolism, muscle structural genes, and other genes from a porcine muscle cDNA library. The results indicated that the expression of the myogenesis-related genes was greater in early Duroc embryos than in early Pietrain embryos (14 to 49 d of gestation), whereas the opposite was found in late embryos (63 to 91 d of gestation). These findings suggest that the myogenesis process is more intense in early Duroc embryos than in Pietrain embryos but that myogenesis is more intense in late Pietrain fetuses than in Duroc fetuses. Transcriptomes of muscle structural genes followed that pattern. The energy metabolism genes were expressed at a higher level in prenatal Pietrain pigs than in prenatal <b>Duroc</b> <b>pigs,</b> except for d 35, when the opposite situation was found. Fatty acid metabolism genes were expressed at a higher level in early (14 to 49 d of gestation) Duroc embryos than in Pietrain embryos. Better understanding of the genomic regulation of tissue formation leads to improved knowledge of the genome under selection and may lead to directed breed-specific changes in the future...|$|R
40|$|A {{high level}} of androstenone in porcine adipose tissue {{is a major factor}} {{contributing}} to boar taint. Porcine hydroxy-delta- 5 -steroid dehydrogenase, 3 beta- and steroid delta-isomerase 1 (3 β-HSD, also known as HSD 3 B 1) {{plays a key role in}} the hepatic metabolism that catalyzes androstenone to β-androstenol. Therefore, 3 β-HSD is a candidate gene for boar taint. This study aimed to investigate functional 3 β-HSD polymorphisms in <b>Duroc</b> <b>pigs.</b> We found eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the full-length porcine 3 β-HSD. Four of the SNPs had restriction enzyme sites, and we genotyped them in 147 uncastrated male <b>Duroc</b> <b>pigs</b> using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Pigs with the GG genotype at the g. 165262 G>A locus (SNP 5) had significantly lower androstenone levels than did those with other genotypes (P = 0. 030). SNP 5 also was associated with differences in 3 β-HSD mRNA levels: pigs with the GG genotype had higher levels than those with other genotypes (P = 0. 019). The SNP 5 polymorphism could affect the hepatic catabolism of androstenone and consequently impact androstenone accumulation in the adipose tissue. Therefore, SNP 5 in the 3 β-HSD of <b>Duroc</b> <b>pigs</b> could be a useful selective marker for decreasing boar taint. © 2013 The Authors, Animal Genetic...|$|R

Subsequent {{to the understanding}} of intrinsic factors controlling both processes, we found our selective melanoma neutron capture therapy (NCT) using 10 B-dopa (melanin substrate) analogue, 10 B 1 -p-boronophenylalanine (10 B 1 -BPA), followed by 10 B(n,α) 7 Li reaction, induced by essentially harmless thermal neutrons, which releases energy of 2. 33 MeV to 14 μ, the diameter of melanoma cells. In vitro/in vivo radiobiological analysis revealed the highly enhanced melanoma killing effect of 10 B 1 -BPA. Chemical and prompt gamma ray spectrometry assays of 10 B accumulated within melanoma cells after 10 B 1 -BPA administration in vitro and in vivo show high affinity, e. g., 10 B melanoma/blood ratio of 11. 5. After successfully eradicating melanoma transplanted into hamsters with NCT, we advanced to preclinical studies using spontaneously occurring melanoma in <b>Duroc</b> <b>pig</b> skin. We cured three melanoma cases, 4. 6 to 12 cm in diameter, by single neutron capture treatment. Complete disappearance of melanoma was obtained without substantial side effects. Acute and subacute toxicity as well as pharmacodynamics of 10 B 1 -BPA have been studied in relation to therapeutic dosage requirements. Clinical radiation dosimetry using human phantom has been carried out. Further preclinical studies using human melanoma transplanted into nude mouse have been a useful model for obtaining optimal results for each melanoma type.

40|$|Meat {{quality is}} a complex trait {{influenced}} by many factors, including genetics, nutrition, feeding environment, animal handling, and their interactions. To elucidate relevant factors affecting pork quality associated with oxidative stress and muscle development, we analyzed protein expression in high quality longissimus dorsi muscles (HQLD) and low quality longissimus dorsi muscles (LQLD) from <b>Duroc</b> <b>pigs</b> by liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) –based proteomic analysis. Between HQLD (n = 20) and LQLD (n = 20) <b>Duroc</b> <b>pigs,</b> 24 differentially expressed proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS. A total of 10 and 14 proteins were highly expressed in HQLD and LQLD, respectively. The 24 proteins have putative functions in the following seven categories: catalytic activity (31 %), ATPase activity (19 %), oxidoreductase activity (13 %), cytoskeletal protein binding (13 %), actin binding (12 %), calcium ion binding (6 %), and structural constituent of muscle (6 %). Silver-stained image analysis revealed significant differential expression of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) between HQLD and LQLD <b>Duroc</b> <b>pigs.</b> LDHA was subjected to in vitro study of myogenesis under oxidative stress conditions and LDH activity assay to verification its role in oxidative stress. No significant difference of mRNA expression level of LDHA was found between normal and oxidative stress condition. However, LDH activity was significantly higher under oxidative stress condition than at normal condition using in vitro model of myogenesis. The highly expressed LDHA {{was positively correlated with}} LQLD. Moreover, LDHA activity increased by oxidative stress was reduced by antioxidant resveratrol. This paper emphasizes the importance of differential expression patterns of proteins and their interaction for the development of meat quality traits.

In the current work we evaluated associations between this microsatellite and production traits in Italian Large White and Italian <b>Duroc</b> <b>pigs.</b> Association studies were carried out on a total of 1120 animals using two experimental designs: i) a selective genotyping approach based on extreme and divergent Italian Large White pigs for back fat thickness (BFT) estimated breeding value (EBV) or on extreme and divergent Italian <b>Duroc</b> <b>pigs</b> for visible intermuscular fat (VIF) EBV; and ii) analysis of unselected pigs (random groups) coming from populations of the two breeds. Allele distributions between Italian Large White and Italian <b>Duroc</b> <b>pigs</b> were different (P< 0. 05) with longer alleles being more frequent in Italian Large White. Results of the association analyses from two different random groups showed that this marker affects average daily gain EBV, lean cut EBV and BFT EBV in Italian Large White and BFT EBV in Italian Duroc (P< 0. 05). Association analysis carried out with random residuals confirmed, to some extent (P= 0. 096), the effects on BFT in the same animals.

We developed an FMOD-based peptide, F 06 -C 40, which has similar effect as FMOD while being more efficient and less costly to produce. In this study, the effect of FMOD and F 06 -C 40 on scars was tested in porcine models for future preclinical studies. Methods: Full-thickness incisional wounds were generated on the dorsum of Yorkshire pigs or red Duroc pigs to simulate human normal or hypertrophic scarring. FMOD, F 06 -C 40, or PBS was injected intradermally around the wound edge. At 8 weeks post-injury, scar formation was evaluated by gross appearance, histological analysis, and tensile strength.

40|$|During wound healing, {{excessive}} inflammation, angiogenesis and differentiated human dermal fibroblast (HDF) function {{contribute to}} scarring, while hyperpigmentation negatively impacts scar quality.

To investigate {{the role of}} the β 2 -adrenoceptor (β 2 AR) in wound scarring, the ability of β 2 AR agonists (β 2 ARag) to alter HDF differentiation and function, wound inflammation, angiogenesis and wound scarring was explored in HDFs, zebrafish, chick allantoic membranes (CAM) and a porcine skin wound model, respectively. Here we identify a β 2 AR-mediated mechanism for scar reduction. β 2 ARag significantly reduced HDF differentiation, via multiple cAMP and/or FGF 2 -dependent mechanisms, in the presence of TGFβ 1, reduced contractile function and inhibited mRNA expression of a number of pro-fibrotic markers. β 2 ARag also reduced inflammation and angiogenesis in zebrafish and CAMs in vivo, respectively.

40|$|Abstract Background Selection for {{increasing}} intramuscular fat content would definitively improve the palatability and juiciness of pig meat {{as well as}} the sensorial and organoleptic properties of cured products. However, evidences obtained in human and model organisms suggest that high levels of intramuscular fat might alter muscle lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. We have analysed this issue by determining the transcriptomic profiles of <b>Duroc</b> <b>pigs</b> with divergent phenotypes for 13 fatness traits. The strong aptitude of <b>Duroc</b> <b>pigs</b> to have high levels of intramuscular fat makes them a valuable model to analyse the mechanisms that regulate muscle lipid metabolism, an issue with evident implications in the elucidation of the genetic basis of human metabolic diseases such as obesity and insulin resistance. Results Muscle gene expression profiles of 68 <b>Duroc</b> <b>pigs</b> belonging to two groups (HIGH and LOW) with extreme phenotypes for lipid deposition and composition traits have been analysed. Microarray and quantitative PCR analysis showed that genes related to fatty acid uptake, lipogenesis and triacylglycerol synthesis were upregulated in the muscle tissue of HIGH pigs, which are fatter and have higher amounts of intramuscular fat than their LOW counterparts. Paradoxically, lipolytic genes also showed increased mRNA levels in the HIGH group suggesting the existence of a cycle where triacylglycerols are continuously synthesized and degraded. Several genes related to the insulin-signalling pathway, that is usually impaired in obese humans, were also upregulated. Finally, genes related to antigen-processing and presentation were downregulated in the HIGH group. Conclusion Our data suggest that selection {{for increasing}} intramuscular fat content in pigs would lead to a shift but not a disruption of the metabolic homeostasis of muscle cells. Future studies on the post-translational changes affecting protein activity or expression as well as information about protein location within the cell would be needed to to elucidate the effects of lipid deposition on muscle metabolism in pigs. </p...|$|R

To investigate {{the role of}} the beta 2 adrenergic receptor (b 2 AR) in wound scarring, the ability of beta 2 adrenergic receptor agonist (b 2 ARag) to alter HDF differentiation and function, wound inflammation, angiogenesis, and wound scarring was explored in HDFs, zebrafish, chick chorioallantoic membrane assay (CAM), and a porcine skin wound model, respectively. Here we identify a b 2 AR-mediated mechanism for scar reduction. b 2 ARag significantly reduced HDF differentiation, via multiple cAMP and/or fibroblast growth factor 2 or basic FGF (FGF 2) -dependent mechanisms, in the presence of transforming growth factor betab 1, reduced contractile function, and inhibited mRNA expression of a number of profibrotic markers. b 2 ARag also reduced inflammation and angiogenesis in zebrafish and CAMs in vivo, respectively. In Red <b>Duroc</b> <b>pig</b> full-thickness wounds, b 2 ARag reduced both scar area and hyperpigmentation by almost 50 % and significantly improved scar quality. Indeed, mechanisms delineated in vitro and in other in vivo models were evident in the b 2 ARag-treated porcine scars in vivo. Both macrophage infiltration and angiogenesis were initially decreased, whereas DF function was impaired in the b 2 ARag-treated porcine wound bed. These data collectively reveal the potential of b 2 ARag to improve skin scarring...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{the process}} of {{establishment}} of an inbred <b>Duroc</b> <b>pig</b> strain, males with size asymmetry of the testes were frequently observed. To clarify the possible causes of this asymmetry, we examined the testes and epididymides of 67 males of the F 4 -F 7 generations at 35 – 100 weeks of age. Testicular weights showed a wide variation (120 – 610 g). When the weights of the testes were compared bilaterally, 35 of the 67 males showed more than a 10 % difference. Histological examination of testes from this asymmetry group revealed a range of seminiferous tubule disruption including disappearance of all germ cells, but not Sertoli cells, in the epithelium. Focal lesions associated with the degenerated tubules were observed. Trends of incident fibrosis or hyalinization of these lesions were seen in aged males of the asymmetry group. Besides this abnormality of spermatogenesis, infiltration of mononuclear inflammatory cells around the tubule was frequently observed in the asymmetry group (32. 9 %, compared with 1. 6 % in males showing testis symmetry). In severe cases, the inflammatory cells were concentrated in the intertubular region instead of Leydig cells. Cellular infiltration was also observed around the epididymal duct and blood vessels, but its incidence did not differ between the symmetry and asymmetry groups. Testicular testosterone levels were significantly increased in the asymmetry group, but those of E 2 and inhibin did not differ between the two groups. These histopathological features indicate that disruption of spermatogenesis after orchitis/epididymo-orchitis could induce testicular atrophy. Genetic predispositions for this trait may cause prevalent retrograde infections, resulting i...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{dramatic}} {{reduction in}} sequencing costs {{with the advent}} of next generation sequencing technologies, obtaining a complete mammalian genome sequence at sufficient depth is still costly. An alternative is partial sequencing. Here, we have sequenced a reduced representation library of an Iberian sow from the Guadyerbas strain, a highly inbred strain that has been used in numerous QTL studies because of its extreme phenotypic characteristics. Using the Illumina Genome Analyzer II (San Diego, CA, USA), we resequenced ~ 1 % of the genome with average 4 × depth, identifying 68 ¿ 778 polymorphisms. Of these, 55 ¿ 457 were putative fixed differences with respect to the assembly, based on the genome of a <b>Duroc</b> <b>pig,</b> and 13 ¿ 321 were heterozygous positions within Guadyerbas. Despite being highly inbred, the estimate of heterozygosity within Guadyerbas was ~ 0. 78 ¿kb- 1 in autosomes, after correcting for low depth. Nucleotide variability was consistently higher at the telomeric regions than {{on the rest of the}} chromosome, likely a result of increased recombination rates. Further, variability was 50 % lower in the X-chromosome than in autosomes, which may be explained by a recent bottleneck or by selection. We divided the whole genome in 500 ¿kb windows and we analyzed overrepresented gene ontology terms in regions of low and high variability. Multi organism process, pigmentation and cell killing were overrepresented in high variability regions and metabolic process ontology, within low variability regions. Further, a genome wide Hudson–Kreitman–Aguadé test was carried out per window; overall, variability was in agreement with neutral expectation...|$|E
40|$|A unique line of <b>Duroc</b> <b>pigs</b> was {{established}} by intensive selection for increased lean growth efficiency. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the influence of this selection strategy on fresh pork quality traits. Two lines of <b>Duroc</b> <b>pigs</b> originating from the same foundation herd were evaluated. One line was selected for lean growth efficiency over five generations (Select line), and the other was a contemporary line maintained from the foundation herd (Control line). All pigs in the trial tested negative for the halothane gene. Selection for lean growth efficiency resulted in improved lean gain, carcass lean, increased loin eye area, and less overall carcass fat. The Select line had significantly lower subjective firmness scores in longissimus and significantly greater amounts of moisture and protein lost as measurable drip in longissimus, semimembranosus, and semitendinosus. There were no differences in subjective color scores or in Hunter L, a, and b values between lines. No selection line differences were observed in glycolytic potential or ultimate pH. The longissimus and the semitendinosus exhibited significantly lower early postmortem pH values in Select line pigs. Warner-Bratzler shear values were higher for Select line longissimus chops. Degradation of troponin-T was decreased in the Select line longissimus samples. This result suggests that reduced degradation of myofibrillar proteins may be associated with increased moisture and protein lost during storage. This research points out that elimination of the halothane gene will solve some but not all of the genetically influenced pork quality problems faced by the industry. The Select line of pigs appears to be more prone to producing pork that is soft and exudative, indicating a link between soft and exudative pork and some genetic selection strategies may exist. Therefore, it appears that selection for some economically important traits, such as feed efficiency or increased lean growth in the absence of the halothane gene, may compromise pork quality...|$|R
40|$|Effects {{of genetic}} {{variation}} in porcine adipocyte and heart fatty acid-binding protein genes, A-FABP and H-FABP, respectively, on intramuscular fat (IMF) content and backfat thickness (BFT) {{were examined in}} F 2 crossbreds of Meishan and Western pigs. The involvement of each FABP gene in IMF accretion was studied to confirm previous results for <b>Duroc</b> <b>pigs.</b> The F 2 crossbred pigs were genotyped for various markers including microsatellite sequences situated within both FABP genes. Linkage analysis assigned the A-FABP and H-FABP genes to marker intervals S 0001 -S 0217 (20 cM) on SSC 4 and Sw 316 -S 0003 (16. 6 cM) on SSC 6, respectively, refining previous chromosomal assignments. Next, the role of both chromosome regions/genes on genetic variation in IMF content and BFT was studied by 1) screening SSC 4 and SSC 6 for QTL affecting both traits by performing a line-cross analysis and 2) estimation {{of the effect of}} individual A-FABP and H-FABP alleles on both traits. In the first analysis, suggestive and chromosome-wise significant evidence for a QTL affecting IMF was detected on SSC 6. The H-FABP gene is a candidate gene for this effect because it resides within the large region containing this putative QTL. The second analysis showed a considerable but nonsignificant effect of H-FABP microsatellite alleles on IMF content. Suggestive evidence for a QTL affecting BFT was found on SSC 6, but H-FABP was excluded as a candidate gene. In conclusion, present and previous results support involvement of H-FABP gene polymorphisms in IMF accretion independently from BFT in pigs. Therefore, implementation of these polymorphisms in marker-assisted selection to control IMF content independently from BFT may be considered. In contrast to previous findings for <b>Duroc</b> <b>pigs,</b> no evidence was found for an effect of the A-FABP gene on IMF or BFT in this population...|$|R
40|$|One-hundred-ninety-two {{weanling}} pigs {{from two}} separate trials, (initial weight 6. 0 and 5. 6 kg) and 400 growing-finishing pigs (initial weight 17 kg) were fed normal and high lysine corn diets containing four levels of lysine in a 2 • 4 factorial arrangement.
