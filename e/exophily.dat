40|$|Studies of the <b>exophily</b> {{exhibited}} by anophelines in a humid coastal area {{and in an}} arid inland region of Tanganyika gave very different results. In the former area, catches of A. gambiae were scanty and largely composed of unfed and gravid females, while in the latter, large numbers of mosquitos were caught outside and {{a great many of}} them were recently fed females. The differences are attributed primarily to the presence outside of large herds of cattle in the inland region and to their absence near the coast. The reports of <b>exophily</b> from other parts of Africa are also analysed and show that there is much variation in the behaviour of A. gambiae in different regions. Some of the variation can be explained in terms of environmental differences, particularly in the availability at night of different hosts. But some of it may be genetically determined. It is suggested that the main task in this field is twofold: firstly, to establish the existence and nature of the behaviour differences described; secondly, to study in detail the mosquitos that survive as exophilic populations in areas where systematic house-spraying is in operation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Long-lasting {{treatment}} kits, {{designed to}} transform untreated nets into long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), may facilitate high coverage with LLINs where non-treated nets are in place. In this study, {{the efficacy of}} ICON ® Maxx (Syngenta) was evaluated under laboratory conditions and in an experimental hut trial in central Côte d'Ivoire, where Anopheles gambiae s. s. are resistant to pyrethroid insecticides. Methods In the laboratory, polyester and polyethylene net samples were treated with ICON ® Maxx, washed up to 20 times and their efficacy determined in World Health Organization (WHO) cone assays against a susceptible laboratory An. gambiae s. s. colony. Over a 12 -month period, the polyester nets were evaluated in a hut trial to determine mosquito deterrence, induced <b>exophily,</b> blood-feeding inhibition and mortality. Results In the laboratory, ICON ® Maxx-treated polyethylene nets showed higher efficacy against pyrethroid-susceptible mosquitoes than polyester nets. After 20 washings, insecticidal efficacy in bioassays was 59. 4 % knockdown (KD) and 22. 3 % mortality for polyethylene, and 55. 3 % KD and 17. 9 % mortality for polyester nets. In experimental huts, treated nets showed strong deterrence, induced <b>exophily</b> and an over three-fold reduction in blood-fed mosquitoes. More than half (61. 8 %) of the mosquitoes entering the huts with treated nets were found dead the next morning despite high levels of KD resistance.

Hut volume, construction materials {{and size of}} entry points impact mosquito entry and exposure to insecticides. The performance of three standard experimental hut designs was compared to evaluate insecticide used in LLINs. Field studies were conducted at the World Health Organization Pesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES) testing site in Muheza, Tanzania. Three East African huts, three West African huts, and three Ifakara huts were compared using Olyset(®) and Permanet 2. 0 (®) versus untreated nets as a control. Outcomes measured were mortality, induced <b>exophily</b> (exit rate), blood feeding inhibition and deterrence (entry rate). Data were analysed using linear mixed effect regression and Bland-Altman comparison of paired differences. A total of 613 mosquitoes were collected in 36 nights, of which 13. 5  % were Anopheles gambiae sensu lato, 21  % Anopheles funestus sensu stricto, 38  % Mansonia species and 28  % Culex species. Ifakara huts caught three times more mosquitoes than the East African and West African huts, while the West African huts caught significantly fewer mosquitoes than the other hut types. Mosquito densities were low, very little mosquito exit was measured {{in any of the}} huts with no measurable <b>exophily</b> caused by the use of either Olyset or Permanet. When the huts were directly compared, the West African huts measured greater <b>exophily</b> than other huts. As unholed nets were used in the experiments and few mosquitoes were captured, {{it was not possible to}} measure difference in feeding success either between treatments or hut types. In each of the hut types there was increased mortality when Permanet or Olyset were present inside the huts compared to the control, however this did not vary between the hut types. Both East African and Ifakara huts performed in a similar way although Ifakara huts allowed more mosquitoes to enter, increasing data power.

40|$|Anopheles gambiae is the {{predominant}} malaria vector species in Ghana, western Africa, {{with a strong}} local presence of Anopheles melas Theobald along the southern coast. We studied the biting behavior of these two species of the Anopheles gambiae complex inland and at the coast in Ghana, with {{special attention to the}} local peoples' preference for outdoor sleeping. We collected mosquitoes at two sites in 2007, representing the moist semideciduous forest zone and the strand and mangrove zone, and the sampling was repeated in the dry and rainy seasons. Sampled mosquitoes were examined for species, parity and size (wing length), and we identified the hosts of their bloodmeals. We interviewed 288 of the village people to determine where and when they slept outdoors. Our study confirmed that An. gambiae is the only species of the An. gambiae complex in the Ashanti region and revealed that An. melas is highly dominant on the western coast of Ghana. Both species showed high human blood rates in indoor resting mosquito samples. More people sleep outside on the coast than inland. An. melas demonstrated high <b>exophily.</b> An. gambiae bit people more frequently indoors and did so more often during the dry season than in the rainy season.

Even though the benefitsof bednets have been proven that {{in most of the}} studies carried out in Africa, their efficacy remains dependent onlocal conditions. In this study, under field conditions, we evaluated the efficacy of two LLINs (PermaNet®vsInterceptor®) and two bednet treatment kits (K-O TAB®vs Fendona 6 SC®) against Anopheles gambiae s. l. Methods: Bednets were evaluated using experimental huts in the village of Pissy located in the Saponé healthdistrict of Burkina Faso. Treatments and sleepers were randomly rotated between huts. Results are expressed interms of induced <b>exophily,</b> mortality after 24 h and blood-feeding inhibition. Results: A total of 1392 An. gambiae s. l. mosquitoes were collected during 120 nights in the experimental huts. The overall mortality rates were 85. 4 % (CL: 79. 7 – 91. 4) and 77. 5 % (CL: 56. 9 – 97. 3) for PermaNet® and Interceptor®,respectively. For the conventionally treated bednets, the mortality was 78. 2 % (CL: 63. 13 – 96. 7) with the Fendona 6 SC®-treated nets and 75. 5 % (CL: 61. 2 – 93) with the K-O TAB®-treated nets. The proportion of blood-fedmosquitoes was significantly higher in the untreated bednet arm than in the treated one, as well as for long-lastingnets than for conventionally treated nets.

40|$|Background: Chemicals {{are used}} on bed nets {{in order to}} prevent {{infected}} bites and to kill aggressive malaria vectors. Because pyrethroid resistance has become widespread in the main malaria vectors, research for alternative active ingredients becomes urgent. Mixing a repellent and a non-pyrethroid insecticide seemed to be a promising tool as mixtures in the laboratory showed the same features as pyrethroids. Methodology/Principal Findings: We present here the results of two trials run against free-flying Anopheles gambiae populations comparing the effects of two insect repellents (either DEET or KBR 3023, also known as icaridin) and an organophosphate insecticide at low-doses (pirimiphos-methyl, PM) used alone and in combination on bed nets. We showed that mixtures of PM and the repellents induced higher <b>exophily,</b> blood feeding inhibition and mortality among wild susceptible and resistant malaria vectors than compounds used alone. Nevertheless the synergistic interactions are only involved in the high mortality induced by the two mixtures.

40|$|Background: Anopheles gambiae, {{the main}} malaria vector in Benin has {{developed}} {{high level of}} resistance to pyrethroid insecticides, which is a serious concern to the future use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) and indoor residual spraying (IRS). In this context, one of the pathways available for malaria vector control would be to investigate alternative classes of insecticides with different mode of action than that of pyrethroids. The goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate under field conditions the efficacy of a carbamate (bendiocarb) and an organophosphate (fenitrothion) against pyrethroid-resistant An. gambiae s. s. Methods: Wild populations and females from laboratory colonies of five days old An. gambiae were bio-assayed during this study. Two pyrethroids (deltamethrin and alphacypermethrin), an organophosphate (fenitrothion), a carbamate (bendiocarb) and a mixture of an organophosphate (chlorpyriphos + a pyrethroid deltamethrin) were compared in experimental huts as IRS treatments. Insecticides were applied in the huts using a hand-operated compression sprayer.

However, the risks to human health, the transmission cycle and particularly the implicated vectors are unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings: To improve our knowledge on the population of phlebotomine sand flies and the potential vectors of canine leishmaniasis, sand flies were collected using sticky traps, light traps and indoor spraying method using pyrethroid insecticides in 16 villages of the rural community of Mont Rolland (Thiès region) between March and July 2005. The 3788 phlebotomine sand flies we collected (2044 males, 1744 females) were distributed among 9 species of which 2 belonged to the genus Phlebotomus: P. duboscqi (vector of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Senegal) and P. rodhaini. The other species belonged to the genus Sergentomyia: S. adleri, S. clydei, S. antennata, S. buxtoni, S. dubia, S. schwetzi and S. magna. The number of individuals and the species composition differed according to the type of trap, suggesting variable, speciesrelated degrees of endophily or <b>exophily.</b> The two species of the genus Phlebotomus were markedly under-represented in comparison to the species of the genus Sergentomyia.

Methods and Findings: We included laboratory and field studies of African malaria vectors that measured resistance {{at the time of}} the study and used World Health Organization–recommended impregnation regimens. We reported mosquito mortality, blood feeding, induced <b>exophily</b> (premature exit of mosquitoes from the hut), deterrence, time to 50 % or 95 % knock-down, and percentage knock-down at 60 min. Publications were searched from 1 January 1980 to 31 December 2013 using MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Science Citation Index Expanded, Social Sciences Citation Index, African Index Medicus, and CAB Abstracts.

Heterogeneity was explored visually and statistically. Included were 36 laboratory and 24 field studies, reported in 25 records. Studies tested and reported resistance inconsistently. Based on the meta-analytic results, the difference in mosquito mortality risk for ITNs compared to UTNs was lower in higher resistance categories. However, mortality risk was significantly higher for ITNs compared to UTNs regardless of resistance.

40|$|Since {{the first}} {{evidence}} of pyrethroids resistance in 1999 in Benin, mutations have rapidly increased in mosquitoes {{and it is now}} difficult to design a study including a control area where malaria vectors are fully susceptible. Few studies have assessed the after effect of resistance on the success of pyrethroid based prevention methods in mosquito populations. We therefore assessed the impact of resistance on the effectiveness of pyrethroids based indoor residual spraying (IRS) in semi-field conditions and long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) in laboratory conditions. The results observed showed low repulsion and low toxicity of pyrethroids compounds in the test populations. The toxicity of pyrethroids used in IRS was significantly low with An. gambiae s. l (< 46 %) but high for other predominant species such asMansonia africana (93 % to 97 %). There were significant differences in terms of the repellent effect expressed as <b>exophily</b> and deterrence compared to the untreated huts (P< 0. 001). Furthermore, mortality was 23. 71 % for OlyseNet 1 and 39. 06 % for PermaNet 1. However, with laboratory susceptible “Kisumu”, mortality was 100 % for both nets suggest-ing a resistance within the wild mosquito populations. Thus treatment with pyrethroids at World Health Organization recommended dose will not be effective at reducing malaria in the coming years. Therefore it is necessary to study how insecticide resistance decreases the efficacy of particular pyrethroids used in pyrethroid-based vector control so that a tar-geted approach can be adopted...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the performances of a new mosaic long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN), i. e. PermaNet ® 3. 0, against wild pyrethroid-resistant Anopheles gambiae s. l. in West and Central Africa. Methods A multi centre experimental hut trial was conducted in Malanville (Benin), Vallée du Kou (Burkina Faso) and Pitoa (Cameroon) to investigate the <b>exophily,</b> blood feeding inhibition and mortality induced by PermaNet ® 3. 0 (i. e. a mosaic net containing piperonyl butoxide and deltamethrin on the roof) comparatively to the WHO recommended PermaNet ® 2. 0 (unwashed and washed 20 -times) and a conventionally deltamethrin-treated net (CTN). Results The personal protection and insecticidal activity of PermaNet 3. 0 and PermaNet ® 2. 0 were excellent (> 80 %) in the "pyrethroid-tolerant" area of Malanville. In the pyrethroid-resistance areas of Pitoa (metabolic resistance) and Vallée du Kou (presence of the L 1014 F kdr mutation), PermaNet ® 3. 0 showed equal or better performances than PermaNet ® 2. 0. It should be noted however that the deltamethrin content on PermaNet ® 3. 0 was up to twice higher than that of PermaNet ® 2. 0. Significant reduction of efficacy of both LLIN was noted after 20 washes although PermaNet ® 3. 0 still fulfilled the WHO requirement for LLIN. Conclusion The use of combination nets for malaria control offers promising prospects. However, further investigations are needed to demonstrate the benefits of using PermaNet ® 3. 0 for the control of pyrethroid resistant mosquito populations in Africa. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In this study, the {{efficacy}} of insecticide-treated nets was evaluated in terms of deterrence, blood-feeding inhibition, induced <b>exophily</b> and mortality on a wild resistant population of Anopheles epiroticus in southern Vietnam, {{in order to gain}} insight into the operational consequences of the insecticide resistance observed in this malaria vector in the Mekong delta. Method An experimental station, based on the model of West Africa and adapted to the behaviour of the target species, was built in southern Vietnam. The study design was adapted from the WHO phase 2 guidelines. The study arms included a conventionally treated polyester net (CTN) with deltamethrin washed just before exhaustion, the WHO recommended long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) PermaNet 2. 0 ® unwashed and 20 times washed and PermaNet 3. 0 ®, designed for the control of pyrethroid resistant vectors, unwashed and 20 times washed. Results The nets still provided personal protection against the resistant An. epiroticus population. The personal protection ranged from 67 % for deltamethrin CTN to 85 % for unwashed PermaNet 3. 0. Insecticide resistance in the An. epiroticus mosquitoes did not seem to alter the deterrent effect of pyrethroids. A significant higher mortality was still observed among the treatment arms {{despite the fact that the}} An. epiroticus population is resistant against the tested insecticides. Conclusion This study shows that CTN and LLINs still protect individuals against a pyrethroid resistant malaria vector from the Mekong region, where insecticide resistance is caused by a metabolic mechanism. In the light of a possible elimination of malaria from the Mekong region these insights in operational consequences of the insecticide resistance on control tools is of upmost importance. </p...|$|E

Methods Bifenthrin {{was used in this}} experiment because it is considered a promising candidate for bednets impregnation. Nets were treated at 50 mg/m 2, a dose that has high insecticidal activity on kdr mosquitoes and at 5 mg/m 2, a dose that kills 95 % of susceptible mosquitoes under laboratory conditions with 3 minutes exposure. Bednets were holed to mimic physical damage. The trial was conducted in three experimental huts from Pitoa, North-Cameroon where Anopheles gambiae displays metabolic resistance and cohabits with An. funestus. Results Bifenthrin at 50 mg/m 2 significantly reduced anophelines' entry rate (> 80 %). This was not observed at 5 mg/m 2. Both treatments increased <b>exophily</b> in An. gambiae, {{and to a lesser extent}} in An. funestus. With bifenthrin at high dosage, over 60 % reduction in blood feeding and 75 – 90 % mortality rates were observed in both vectors. Despite presence of holes, only a single An. gambiae and two An. funestus females were collected inside the treated net, and all were found dead. The same trends were observed with low dosage bifenthrin though in most cases, no significant difference was found with the untreated control net.

40|$|Only {{pyrethroid}} insecticides {{have so far}} been recommended {{for the treatment of}} mosquito nets for malaria control. Increasing resistance of malaria vectors to pyrethroids threatens to reduce the potency of this important method of vector control. Among the strategies proposed for resistance management is to use a pyrethroid and a non-pyrethroid insecticide in combination on the same mosquito net, either separately or as a mixture. Mixtures are particularly promising if there is potentiation between the two insecticides as this would make it possible to lower the dosage of each, as has been demonstrated under laboratory conditions for a mixture of bifenthrin (pyrethroid) and carbosulfan (carbamate). The effect of these types of treatment were compared in experimental huts on wild populations of Anopheles gambiae Giles and the nuisance mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus Say, both of which are multi-resistant. Four treatments were evaluated in experimental huts over six months: the recommended dosage of 50 mg m− 2 bifenthrin, 300 mg m− 2 carbosulfan, a mosaic of 300 mg m− 2 carbosulfan on the ceiling and 50 mg m− 2 bifenthrin on the sides, and a mixture of 6. 25 mg m− 2 carbosulfan and 25 mg m− 2 bifenthrin. The mixture and mosaic treatments did not differ significantly in effectiveness from carbosulfan and bifenthrin alone against anophelines in terms of deterrency, induced <b>exophily,</b> blood feeding inhibition and overall mortality, but were more effective than in earlier tests with deltamethrin. These results are considered encouraging, as the combination of different classes of insecticides might be a potential tool for resistance management.

40|$|Background: Due to {{the spread}} of pyrethroid-resistance in malaria vectors in Africa, new {{strategies}} and tools are urgently needed to better control malaria transmission. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the performances of a new mosaic long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN), i. e. PermaNet (R) 3. 0, against wild pyrethroid-resistant Anopheles gambiae s. l. in West and Central Africa. Methods: A multi centre experimental hut trial was conducted in Malanville (Benin), Vallee du Kou (Burkina Faso) and Pitoa (Cameroon) to investigate the <b>exophily,</b> blood feeding inhibition and mortality induced by PermaNet (R) 3. 0 (i. e. a mosaic net containing piperonyl butoxide and deltamethrin on the roof) comparatively to the WHO recommended PermaNet (R) 2. 0 (unwashed and washed 20 -times) and a conventionally deltamethrin-treated net (CTN). Results: The personal protection and insecticidal activity of PermaNet 3. 0 and PermaNet (R) 2. 0 were excellent (> 80 %) in the "pyrethroid-tolerant" area of Malanville. In the pyrethroid-resistance areas of Pitoa (metabolic resistance) and Vallee du Kou (presence of the L 1014 F kdr mutation), PermaNet (R) 3. 0 showed equal or better performances than PermaNet (R) 2. 0. It should be noted however that the deltamethrin content on PermaNet (R) 3. 0 was up to twice higher than that of PermaNet (R) 2. 0. Significant reduction of efficacy of both LLIN was noted after 20 washes although PermaNet (R) 3. 0 still fulfilled the WHO requirement for LLIN. Conclusion: The use of combination nets for malaria control offers promising prospects. However, further investigations are needed to demonstrate the benefits of using PermaNet (R) 3. 0 for the control of pyrethroid resistant mosquito populations in Africa...|$|E
40|$|Background: In this study, the {{efficacy}} of insecticide-treated nets was evaluated in terms of deterrence, blood-feeding inhibition, induced <b>exophily</b> and mortality on a wild resistant population of Anopheles epiroticus in southern Vietnam, {{in order to gain}} insight into the operational consequences of the insecticide resistance observed in this malaria vector in the Mekong delta. Method: An experimental station, based on the model of West Africa and adapted to the behaviour of the target species, was built in southern Vietnam. The study design was adapted from the WHO phase 2 guidelines. The study arms included a conventionally treated polyester net (CTN) with deltamethrin washed just before exhaustion, the WHO recommended long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) PermaNet 2. 0 (R) unwashed and 20 times washed and PermaNet 3. 0 (R), designed for the control of pyrethroid resistant vectors, unwashed and 20 times washed. Results: The nets still provided personal protection against the resistant An. epiroticus population. The personal protection ranged from 67 % for deltamethrin CTN to 85 % for unwashed PermaNet 3. 0. Insecticide resistance in the An. epiroticus mosquitoes did not seem to alter the deterrent effect of pyrethroids. A significant higher mortality was still observed among the treatment arms {{despite the fact that the}} An. epiroticus population is resistant against the tested insecticides. Conclusion: This study shows that CTN and LLINs still protect individuals against a pyrethroid resistant malaria vector from the Mekong region, where insecticide resistance is caused by a metabolic mechanism. In the light of a possible elimination of malaria from the Mekong region these insights in operational consequences of the insecticide resistance on control tools is of upmost importance...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Since 2008, the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) {{has been}} engaged in the {{implementation}} of indoor residual spraying (IRS) in Benin. The first and second round was a success with a drastic decrease of malaria transmission in areas under IRS. We present here the results of the third round. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the results of the third round of IRS to those achieved during the first two rounds. A second success of IRS will enable the Government of Benin to extend the strategy to other areas. Methods Mosquito collections were carried out in the department of Ouémé where the homes of four districts were treated with bendiocarb. In these districts, more than 350 000 inhabitants were protected by IRS. A fifth untreated district served as control. In the five districts, mosquito collections were organized to follow the dynamics of malaria transmission and possible changes in the behavior of mosquitoes. Results A significant reduction in human biting rate was recorded after the third round of IRS, specifically in Adjohoun (89. 78 %), Dangbo (56. 8 %) and Missérété (93. 22 %) where an inhabitant received less than 2 bites of An. gambiae per night. During this same time, the entomological inoculation rate (EIR) declined dramatically in all areas under intervention (74. 26 % reduction). We also noted a significant reduction in longevity, the blood feeding rate of the vectors and an increase in <b>exophily</b> induced by bendiocarb on An. gambiae and Mansonia spp. Conclusion The present study showed, once again, the effectiveness of bendiocarb on anopheles populations resistant to pyrethroids.

40|$|Pyrethroid-impreganted bednets are {{advocated}} for personal protection against malaria vectors. To avoid {{the need for}} periodic re-treatment, it would be advantageous to have nets that retain insecticidal efficacy for years and withstand repeated washing. Such a type of commercially produced bednet with permethrin 2 % incorporated in polyethylene fibres (trademark Olyset Net(R) supplied by Sumika Life-Tech Co., Osaka, Japan) was evaluated against mosquitoes in veranda-trap huts at Yaokoffikro, near Bouaké, Côte d'Ivoire, by standard WHOPES phase II procedures. Four Olyset Nets were compared with a standard untreated polyester net as control. They comprised three examples previously used in a village for over 3 years (one washed, one dirty, one very dirty) and a previously unused Olyset Net newly unwrapped, from the same orignal batch. Bioassays with 3 min exposure of susceptible #Anopheles gambiae$ Giles (Diptera : Culicidae) gave more than 99 % mortality of female mosquitoes tested on the 'new' Olyset Net. The used Olyset Nets gave mortality rates averaging 83 % for the washed net, 85 % for the dirty net and 55 % for the very dirty net (within 24 -h following 3 min exposure). Thus, Olyset Nets were found to remain remarkably effective against susceptible #An. gambiae$ for at least 3 years under field conditions. Wild pyrethroid-resistant populations of #Culex quinquefasciatus$ Say and #An. gambiae$ (savanna cytotype with 96 % kdr) were assessed during June-August 1999 for their responses to sleepers protected by nets in the experimental huts. With regard to hut entry by foraging female mosquitoes, Olyset Nets showed some deterrency against #An. gambiae$ (44 % reduction by the new net, approximately 20 % by the dirty nets, none by the washed net), but not against #Cx. quinquefasciatus$.

40|$|Abstract Background Anopheles gambiae, {{the main}} malaria vector in Benin has {{developed}} {{high level of}} resistance to pyrethroid insecticides, which is a serious concern to the future use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) and indoor residual spraying (IRS). In this context, one of the pathways available for malaria vector control would be to investigate alternative classes of insecticides with different mode of action than that of pyrethroids. The goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate under field conditions the efficacy of a carbamate (bendiocarb) and an organophosphate (fenitrothion) against pyrethroid-resistant An. gambiae s. s. Methods Wild populations and females from laboratory colonies of five days old An. gambiae were bio-assayed during this study. Two pyrethroids (deltamethrin and alphacypermethrin), an organophosphate (fenitrothion), a carbamate (bendiocarb) and a mixture of an organophosphate (chlorpyriphos + a pyrethroid deltamethrin) were compared in experimental huts as IRS treatments. Insecticides were applied in the huts using a hand-operated compression sprayer. The deterrency, <b>exophily,</b> blood feeding rate and mortality induced by these insecticides against An. gambiae were compared to the untreated control huts. Results Deltamethrin, alphacypermethrin and bendiocarb treatment significantly reduced mosquito entry into the huts (p An. gambiae (in the first month) and 77. 8 % (in the fourth month). Bendiocarb and the mixture chlorpyriphos/deltamethrin mortality rates ranged from 97. 9 to 100 % the first month and 77. 7 - 88 % the third month respectively. Conclusion After four months, fenitrothion, bendiocarb and the mixture chlorpyriphos/deltamethrin performed effectively against pyrethroid-resistant Anopheles. These results showed that bendiocarb could be recommended as an effective insecticide for use in IRS operations in Benin, particularly as the mixture chlorpyriphos/deltamethrin does not have WHOPES authorization and complaints were mentioned by the sleepers about the safety and smell of fenitrothion. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The use of {{repellent}} {{materials from}} plants against nuisance insects is common with great potential to compliment existing malaria control programmes and this requires evaluation {{in the field}}. Ocimum plant species, Ocimum suave (Willd) and O. kilimandscharicum (Guerke) materials and their essential oils extracted by steam distillation were evaluated {{in the field and}} experimental huts for repellence, <b>exophily</b> and feeding inhibition effects against three mosquito species, Anopheles arabiensis (Patton), An. gambiae ss (Giles) and Culex quinquefasciatus (Say). The protective effect of essential oils from Ocimum plants were compared with N, N-diethly- 3 - methylbenzamide (DEET), a standard synthetic repellent. Also, the protective effect of fumigation by burning of repellent plants; Ocimum suave, Ocimum kilimandscharicum, Azadirachta indica, Eucalyptus globules and Lantana camara were tested in experimental huts and selected local houses. Results In the field, protection by Ocimum plants from mosquito bites was high and there was small variation among different mosquito species. Protection efficiency was 93. 4 %, 91. 98 % and 89. 75 % for An. arabiensis while for Cx. quinquefaciatus it was 91. 30 %, 88. 65 % and 90. 50 % for DEET, Ocimum suave and O. kilimandscharicum respectively. In the experimental hut, deterrence induced by burning of Ocimum and other plants ranged from 73. 1. 0 % to 81. 9 % for An. arabiensis and 56. 5 % to 67. 8 % for Cx. quinquefaciatus, while feeding inhibition was 61. 1 % to 100 % for An. arabiensis and 50 % to 100 % for Cx. quinquefaciatus. Evaluations under field conditions confirmed high protective efficacy, enhanced feeding inhibition and house entry inhibition (Deterrence). Conclusion This study shows the potential of Ocimum suave and Ocimum kilimandscharicum crude extracts and whole plants of Ocimum suave, Ocimum kilimandscharicum, Azadirachta indica, Eucalyptus globules and Lantana camara for use in protecting against human biting while the burning of plants reduces significantly the indoor resting mosquitoes. </p...|$|E

Simulations with diversion and mortality parameters typical of endophagic, endophilic African vectors, such as Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles funestus, were compared with those for endophagic but exophilic species, such as Anopheles arabiensis, thatalso enter houses but leave earlier before lethal exposure to insecticide-treated surfaces occurs. Insecticidal nets were predicted to redistribute successful feeding events to dawn and dusk where these were included in the profile of innately preferred feeding times. However, predicted distributions of biting unprotected humans, were unaffected because extended hostseeking activity was redistributed to innately preferred feeding times. Recently observed alterations of biting activity distributions therefore reflect processes not captured in this model, such as evolutionary selection of heritably modified feeding time preferences or phenotypically plastic expression of feeding time preference caused by associative learning. Surprisingly, endophagy combined with <b>exophily,</b> among mosquitoes that enter houses but then feed and/or rest briefly before rapidly exiting, consistently attenuated predicted insecticide impact more than any feeding time preference trait. Regardless of underlying cause, recent redistributions of host-biting activity to dawn and dusk necessitate new outdoor control strategies.

40|$|Abstract Background Models of Plasmodium {{falciparum malaria}} {{epidemiology}} that provide realistic quantitative predictions of likely epidemiological outcomes of existing vector control strategies {{have the potential}} to assist in planning for the control and elimination of malaria. This work investigates the applicability of mathematical modelling of malaria transmission dynamics in Rachuonyo South, a district with low, unstable transmission in the highlands of western Kenya. Methods Individual-based stochastic simulation models of malaria in humans and a deterministic model of malaria in mosquitoes as part of the OpenMalaria platform were parameterized to create a scenario for the study area based on data from ongoing field studies and available literature. The scenario was simulated for a period of two years with a population of 10, 000 individuals and validated against malaria survey data from Rachuonyo South. Simulations were repeated with multiple random seeds and an ensemble of 14 model variants to address stochasticity and model uncertainty. A one-dimensional sensitivity analysis was conducted to address parameter uncertainty. Results The scenario was able to reproduce the seasonal pattern of the entomological inoculation rate (EIR) and patent infections observed in an all-age cohort of individuals sampled monthly for one year. Using an EIR estimated from serology to parameterize the scenario resulted in a closer fit to parasite prevalence than an EIR estimated using entomological methods. The scenario parameterization was most sensitive to changes in the timing and effectiveness of indoor residual spraying (IRS) and the method used to detect P. falciparum in humans. It was less sensitive than expected to changes in vector biting behaviour and climatic patterns. Conclusions The OpenMalaria model of P. falciparum transmission can be used to simulate the impact of different combinations of current and potential control interventions to help plan malaria control in this low transmission setting. In this setting and for these scenarios, results were highly sensitive to transmission, vector exophagy, <b>exophily</b> and susceptibility to IRS, and the detection method used for surveillance. The level of accuracy of the results will thus depend upon the precision of estimates for each. New methods for analysing and evaluating uncertainty in simulation results will enhance the usefulness of simulations for malaria control decision-making. Improved measurement tools and increased primary data collection will enhance model parameterization and epidemiological monitoring. Further research is needed on the relationship between malaria indices to identify the best way to quantify transmission in low transmission settings. Measuring EIR through mosquito collection may not be the optimal way to estimate transmission intensity in areas with low, unstable transmission. </p...|$|E
40|$|Pyrethroid insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) help {{contribute}} to reducing malaria deaths in Africa, but their efficacy {{is threatened by}} insecticide resistance in some malaria mosquito vectors. We therefore assessed the evidence that resistance is attenuating the effect of ITNs on entomological outcomes. We included laboratory and field studies of African malaria vectors that measured resistance {{at the time of}} the study and used World Health Organization-recommended impregnation regimens. We reported mosquito mortality, blood feeding, induced <b>exophily</b> (premature exit of mosquitoes from the hut), deterrence, time to 50 % or 95 % knock-down, and percentage knock-down at 60 min. Publications were searched from 1 January 1980 to 31 December 2013 using MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Science Citation Index Expanded, Social Sciences Citation Index, African Index Medicus, and CAB Abstracts. We stratified studies into three levels of insecticide resistance, and ITNs were compared with untreated bed nets (UTNs) using the risk difference (RD). Heterogeneity was explored visually and statistically. Included were 36 laboratory and 24 field studies, reported in 25 records. Studies tested and reported resistance inconsistently. Based on the meta-analytic results, the difference in mosquito mortality risk for ITNs compared to UTNs was lower in higher resistance categories. However, mortality risk was significantly higher for ITNs compared to UTNs regardless of resistance. For cone tests: low resistance, risk difference (RD) 0. 86 (95 % CI 0. 72 to 1. 01); moderate resistance, RD 0. 71 (95 % CI 0. 53 to 0. 88); high resistance, RD 0. 56 (95 % CI 0. 17 to 0. 95). For tunnel tests: low resistance, RD 0. 74 (95 % CI 0. 61 to 0. 87); moderate resistance, RD 0. 50 (95 % CI 0. 40 to 0. 60); high resistance, RD 0. 39 (95 % CI 0. 24 to 0. 54). For hut studies: low resistance, RD 0. 56 (95 % CI 0. 43 to 0. 68); moderate resistance, RD 0. 39 (95 % CI 0. 16 to 0. 61); high resistance, RD 0. 35 (95 % CI 0. 27 to 0. 43). However, with the exception of the moderate resistance category for tunnel tests, there was extremely high heterogeneity across studies in each resistance category (chi-squared test, p< 0. 00001, I² varied from 95 % to 100 %). This meta-analysis found that ITNs are more effective than UTNs regardless of resistance. There appears to be a relationship between resistance and the RD for mosquito mortality in laboratory and field studies. However, the substantive heterogeneity in the studies' results and design may mask the true relationship between resistance and the RD, and the results need to be interpreted with caution. Our analysis suggests the potential for cumulative meta-analysis in entomological trials, but further field research in this area will require specialists in the field to work together to improve the quality of trials, and to standardise designs, assessment, and reporting of both resistance and entomological outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Culicoides were {{captured}} at a BTV-infected dairy near Gulpen {{in the province}} of Limburg (south-cast Netherlands) between 14 September and 4 October 2006. Onderstepoort-type blacklight traps were used to sample Culicoides both inside and outside a partially open shed housing 11 cattle. A total of 28 light trap collections were made at the shed and yielded: 9371 Culicoides representing 11 species; > 90 % comprised five potential vectors of BTV and in order of abundance were Culicoides obsoletus and Culicoides scoticus (of the Obsoletus Complex), Culicoides dewulfi, Culicoides pulicaris and Culicoides chiopterus, Culicoides imicola, the principal Mediterranean (and African) vector of BTV was absent. 2339 Culicoides representing seven species {{were captured}} inside (endophily) the cattle shed: > 95 % comprised the Obsoletus Complex and C. dewulfi. Conversely, the Pulicaris Complex, represented by five species and including C. pulicaris, showed strong <b>exophily</b> with > 97 % captured outside the shed. 7032 Culicoides were captured outside the shed, approximately threefold more than inside. This trend was reversed on an overcast day, when eightfold more Culicoides were captured inside: this indicates that when the light intensity outdoors is low Culicoides will attack (i) earlier in the day while cattle are still at pasture, and (ii) might follow cattle into the sheds in the late afternoon leading to elevated numbers of biting midges being trapped inside the shed during the subsequent hours of darkness. Culicoides were captured inside the shed on all 14 sampling nights. On occasion up to 33 % were freshly blood fed indicating they had avidly attacked the cattle inside (endophagy); because half the cattle had seroconverted to BTV, and because no cattle were left outdoors at night, the data indicate that (i) the housing of animals in partially open buildings does not interrupt the transmission of BTV, and/or (ii) BTV is being transmitted while cattle are grazing outdoors during the day. The capture of partially engorged midges inside the shed shows they are being disturbed while feeding; this may lead to cattle being attacked repeatedly, and if these attacks include older parous BTV-infected Culicoides, may enhance virus dissemination (particularly in sheds where cattle stand close together). Endo- and exophagy by potential vector Culicoides - coupled to increased adult longevity and multiple feeding events in single (potentially) infected midges - would ensure an R- 0 of > 1, resulting in the continued maintenance and spread of BTV within local vertebrate populations. Four light trap collections made additionally in a mature deciduous forest 70 m from the shed yielded a high proportion (48 %) of gravid females amongst which 10 % had incompletely digested blackened blood meals in their abdomens; the absence of this age category in Culicoides captured at the sheds indicates that all Culicoides, after engorgement, exit the buildings to undergo oogenesis elsewhere. In Europe, the blacklight trap is used widely for the nocturnal monitoring of Culicoides; a drawback to this approach is that this trap cannot be used to sample midges that are active during the day. Because diurnal biting in vector Culicoides may constitute a significant and underestimated component of BTV transmission a novel capture methodology will be required in future and is discussed briefly.
