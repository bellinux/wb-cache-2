5|$|Additions {{to the end}} musical number, {{including}} visual gags such as Bob {{appearing in}} uniform, were added after the animatics. The crew felt that watching the character singing would not be interesting <b>enough</b> <b>and</b> they had to include these gags to make it work. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening was surprised {{when he saw the}} additions, because he originally thought they were silly and would not appear in the final cut, but he has grown to like them.|$|E
5|$|During May 1908 {{the workers}} were not being paid {{regularly}} <b>enough,</b> <b>and</b> took to a strike on 6 June; 2,120 men were at the most in strike. As a consequence Norsk Hydro {{became a member of}} Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise (NAF). Negotiations were conducted in August, but failed—not until Minister of Labour Nils Claus Ihlen meddled and Sam Eyde pulled Norsk Hydro out of NAF and reduced his demands did the strike end, on 6 October.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} rounds, Garcia {{steadily}} pulled ahead, outboxing Judah throughout. Judah was {{in serious trouble}} in rounds 5 and 6, then finally {{went down in the}} 8th. From there, things took a surprising turn. Never known for his resolve or ability to turn the fight around late, Judah responded to the knockdown by coming on strong down the stretch. Judah took the last 3 rounds, though his deficit from earlier in the fight meant it wasn't <b>enough</b> <b>and</b> Garcia defeated Judah by unanimous decision (115-112, 114-112, 116-111).|$|E
5|$|Eva also visited Switzerland {{during her}} European tour, a visit {{that has been}} viewed as {{the worst part of}} the trip. According to the book Evita: A Biography by John Barnes, while she {{traveled}} down a street with many people crowding her car, someone threw two stones and smashed the windshield. She threw her hands up in shock, but was not injured. Later, while sitting with the Foreign Minister, protesters threw tomatoes at her. The tomatoes hit the Foreign Minister and splattered on Eva's dress. After these two events, Eva had had <b>enough,</b> <b>and</b> after two months returned to Argentina.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Finn has <b>enough,</b> <b>and</b> knocks the king's clock {{from the}} wall. It crashes into the kingdom's huge stove, {{knocking}} over {{a pot of}} water. The water puts out the fire, which causes the warm updraft going into the chimney to cease; this updraft was actually holding Seven's barge in stasis all of this time. The barge comes crashing down into the kingdom, and Jake uses his stretching powers to save Finn. Thence, Finn, Jake, and Seven escape.|$|E

40|$|In an abelian {{category}} A {{with small}} Ext groups, {{we show that}} there exists a one-to-one correspondence between any two of the following: balanced pairs, subfunctors F of Ext^ 1 _A(-,-) such that A has <b>enough</b> F-projectives <b>and</b> <b>enough</b> F-injectives <b>and</b> Quillen exact structures E with <b>enough</b> E-projectives <b>and</b> <b>enough</b> E-injectives. In this case, we get a strengthened version of the translation of the Wakamatsu lemma to the exact context, and also prove that subcategories which are E-resolving and epimorphic precovering with kernels in their right E-orthogonal class and subcategories which are E-coresolving and monomorphic preenveloping with cokernels in their left E-orthogonal class are determined by each other. Then we apply these results to construct some (pre) enveloping and (pre) covering classes and complete hereditary E-cotorsion pairs in the module category.

5|$|For an {{ecosystem}} to support ticks, it must satisfy two requirements: the population density of host {{species in the}} area must be high <b>enough,</b> <b>and</b> humidity must be high enough for ticks to remain hydrated. Due to their role in transmitting Lyme disease, ixodid ticks, particularly the North American I.scapularis, have been studied using geographic information systems to develop predictive models for ideal tick habitats. According to these studies, certain features of a given microclimate – such as sandy soil, hardwood trees, rivers, {{and the presence of}} deer – were determined to be good predictors of dense tick populations.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Norsk Flytjeneste {{purchased}} two 50-passenger Douglas DC-6Bs from Braathens SAFE and leased {{one from}} Sterling Airways. They {{were used for}} domestic and international charter. The largest contract was from the Norwegian Church Aid, who contracted Norsk Flytjeneste to fly aid to Bangladesh. However, the airline failed to make money on the DC-6s, mostly {{because of the high}} operating costs, and sold them after a year. The company followed up with purchasing a ten-seat Cessna Citation business jet that they offered in the charter market. However, the market was not large <b>enough,</b> <b>and</b> the jet was sold.|$|E
5|$|In April 1941, county {{officials}} admitted {{that it was}} likely that the $7million appropriated would not be <b>enough,</b> <b>and</b> instead {{it would be better}} spent on improving other nearby parkways. The proposed parkway would have needed $400,000 more for additional right-of-way, and the construction costs would leave no money to repave the Bronx River Parkway, the link to the Cross County Parkway, and to extend the Saw Mill River Parkway. The county would have had to spend $8million of its own money as well. The parkway was instead shortened from Bronxville to Elmsford.|$|E

5|$|In December, City manager Stuart Pearce {{publicly}} {{stated that}} Samaras {{would have to}} 'toughen up', {{if he wanted to}} be a success in the Premier League. He said that Samaras' all round game wasn't good <b>enough,</b> <b>and</b> that he would need to learn to pass the ball better and compete more effectively. Some fans had criticised Pearce for signing Samaras, along with other foreign players, who had not settled in well enough to the English game. On 2 January, Samaras came on as a half-time substitute, and scored twice, as they beat Everton 2–1.|$|E
5|$|It's about obsession, {{and that}} can be scary because you're not in control and you don't know where it's going to stop. It says that, at any point in {{somebody}}'s life, when they loved somebody strongly <b>enough</b> <b>and</b> that person returns, a certain touch, a certain physical gesture can turn them from being defiant and disgusted with this person to being subservient again. And it's not just a pleasurable feeling that comes back, it's the complete terror and loss of control that comes back. And I think that's ultimately a great weapon.|$|E
5|$|Most mantises chase tempting prey if it strays close <b>enough,</b> <b>and</b> will {{go further}} {{when they are}} {{especially}} hungry. Once within reach, mantises strike rapidly to grasp the prey with their spiked raptorial forelegs. Some ground and bark species pursue their prey in a more active way. For example, members of a few genera such as the ground mantises, Entella, Ligaria, and Ligariella run over dry ground seeking prey, much as tiger beetles do.|$|E

5|$|The Beauchamp–Sharp Tragedy {{inspired}} fictional works, notably Edgar Allan Poe's unfinished play Politian and Robert Penn Warren's World <b>Enough</b> <b>and</b> Time. William Gilmore Simms wrote three works {{based on}} the Sharp's murder and aftermath: Beauchampe: or The Kentucky Tragedy, A Tale of Passion, Charlemont, and Beauchampe: A Sequel to Charlemonte. Greyslaer: A Romance of the Mohawk by Charles Fenno Hoffman, Octavia Bragaldi by Charlotte Barnes, Sybil by John Savage, and Conrad and Eudora; or, The Death of Alonzo: A Tragedy and Leoni, The Orphan of Venice both by Thomas Holley Chivers, all draw to some degree on the events that surround Sharp's murder.|$|E

The ACLU supported many of the Communists during their appeals (although most of the initiative originated with local ACLU affiliates, not the national headquarters) but most convictions were upheld.

5|$|The {{decision}} to form two groups, Belle Amie and One Direction, from soloists {{at the end}} of the bootcamp stage was branded unfair by some of the other groups, as neither had entered the competition as groups.

Cowell defended the decision, saying that the existing groups were not good <b>enough</b> <b>and</b> other groups such as The Wanted and the Spice Girls were created similarly.|$|E

5|$|The new He 162 {{had about}} 30 minutes worth of fuel. This {{endurance}} {{was simply not}} <b>enough,</b> <b>and</b> at least two JG 1 pilots were killed making Deadstick landing after exhausting their fuel. By April, I./JG 1 had scored a number of kills, but {{at the cost of}} 13 He 162s and 10 pilots. The losses were mostly attributed to issues with the He 162 such as engine flame-outs or occasional structural failures, which can most probably be attributed to poor design and insufficient development time. On 24 April 1945, III./JG 1 was disbanded.|$|E
