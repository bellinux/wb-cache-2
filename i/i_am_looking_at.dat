500|$|The {{edition of}} October 1, 1990 of People {{included}} {{an interview with}} then-First Lady of the United States Barbara Bush. The article included the following passage: [...] "She loves America's Funniest Home Videos but remains baffled after sampling The Simpsons. [...] "It was the dumbest thing I had ever seen," [...] she says, [...] "but it's a family thing, and I guess it's clean." [...] The writers decided to respond by privately sending a polite letter on September 28 to Bush where they posed as Marge Simpson. On October 9, Bush sent a reply: [...] "Dear Marge, How kind of you to write. I'm glad you spoke your mind ... I foolishly didn't know you had one. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> a picture of you... depicted on a plastic cup... with your blue hair filled with pink birds peeking out all over. Evidently, you and your charming family— Lisa, Homer, Bart and Maggie— are camping out. It's a nice family scene. Clearly you are setting a good example {{for the rest of}} the country. Please forgive a loose tongue." ...|$|E
500|$|Still, Balzac {{believed}} that keeping her letters was dangerous and, {{in a moment}} of characteristic impulse, threw them into the fire. He described it to her as [...] "the saddest and most frightful day of my life... <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the ashes as I write to you, and I tremble seeing how little space fifteen years takes up." [...] On 5 September 1847 he left Paris to join {{her for the first time}} in Wierzchownia. They spent several happy months together, but financial obligations required his presence in France. The Revolution of 1848 began one week after his return. Back in Wierzchownia, Hańska lost 80,000 francs due to a granary fire, and her time was consumed with three lawsuits. These complications, and Balzac's constant debt, meant that their finances were unstable, and she hesitated anew at the idea of marriage. In any case, a wedding would be impossible without approval from the Tsar, which he did not grant until spring of 1850. On 2 July 1849 Russian authorities responding to Balzac's request in December 1847 to marry Hańska stated that he could do so, but that Hańska could not keep her land.|$|E

5000|$|Prohlížel jsem si ho. - <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> him. (<b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{studying}} him.) ...|$|R
60|$|But I did not heed him, because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the Lord God.|$|R
60|$|BLANCO. I'll tell you, Sheriff. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> {{it because}} there was {{something}} written on it.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's nonsense, Colonel Quaritch, perfect nonsense, if {{you will}} forgive me for telling you so," [...] Ida was saying with warmth. [...] "It is all very well for you to {{complain}} that my trees are a blur, and the castle nothing but a splotch, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the water, and if <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the water, it is quite impossible that I should see {{the trees and the}} cows otherwise than I have rendered them on the canvas. True art is to paint what the painter sees and as he sees it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly! And so {{you came}} along to me. And you see, I don't turn my back, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> you and {{thinking}} about you from top to toe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> them," [...] I told her. [...] "I {{see nothing}} but greed. I see no face that has not already lost {{a great part of}} its attractiveness." ...|$|E

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> your {{notes on}} birds yesterday. How sweet they <b>are!</b> But <b>I</b> can't forgive that young {{blackbird}} for getting wild again.[35] ...|$|R
60|$|As I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> her {{beautiful}} face, observant of her work, {{she raised her}} mild clear eyes, and saw that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> her.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{there is}} a poison which {{undermines}} the sources of life," [...] he remarked, [...] "it is alcohol. If {{there is a}} vice that degrades humanity, it is intoxication. Mr. Mountjoy, {{are you aware that}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{want to say}} {{anything}}," [...] said I, [...] "against what I {{have seen}} to-day, and I don't {{want to think of}} anything else while <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> it; but this I will say, that landscape with Scott is very different from landscape without him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{relying on}} you, Mr. Stephens, {{to tell me}} all about Abousir," [...] said Miss Sadie Adams. [...] "I do like to know what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> right there at the time, and not six hours {{afterwards}} in my state-room. I haven't got Abou-Simbel and the wall pictures straight in my mind yet, though I saw them yesterday." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I have {{something}} to say. You and <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> each other. Does my face tell you what is passing in my mind?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, son. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> that trinket {{which you}} wear. Of course I have noted it before, but never closely. It is strange, very strange!" ...|$|R
60|$|Although <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> Biddy as <b>I</b> spoke, and {{although}} {{she opened her eyes}} very wide when I had spoken, she did not <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me.|$|R
60|$|I am stunned {{beyond the}} {{possibility}} of discussion for a space. In this very place {{it must have been}} that the high terrace ran with the gardens below it, along which I came from my double to our hotel. I am going back, but now through reality, along the path I passed so happily in my dream. And the people I saw then are the people <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> now--with a difference.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all unlikely," [...] {{replied the}} captain, fixing {{his glass and}} putting it to his eye, [...] "though I don't think it likely that we shall be attacked, as we are large and don't look like a richly freighted merchant-man. However, there is no saying. These scoundrels fear nothing, and when hard up will attack {{anything}} but a man-of-war, I half suspect that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> one of them now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I don't think I have--I {{have had}} the same thing said to me two or three times before," [...] replied Fan naïvely. [...] "But I wish you would tell me more about my father when he was healthy and happy. Was he really as {{handsome}} as he looks in the portrait? It seems so life-like that when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> it I can hardly realise that he is not somewhere living on the earth, that I shall never hold his hand and hear his voice." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{fascinated by}} it myself. Every moment I had to glance over my shoulder. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> him when a voice {{outside the door}} said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> him. And <b>I</b> {{heard the}} crash, too--something awful. Like the {{mainmast}} going overboard. It {{was as if}} something had struck him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} he's very clever," [...] she said one day, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the photograph, [...] "but I know he's good. He has a charming character." ...|$|R
6000|$|And he will {{wonder why}} still there seems {{reason for this}} outcry. Still, after what {{analysis}} and proof of his being right have as yet been given, the reader may perhaps be saying to himself: [...] "All this reasoning is of no use to me. Turner does not give me the idea of nature; I do not feel before one of his pictures as I should in the real scene. Constable takes me out into the shower, and Claude into the sun; and De Wint makes me feel as if I were walking in the fields; but Turner keeps me in the house, and I know always that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> a picture." ...|$|E
60|$|I am now comfortably {{established}} {{next door}} to Mr. Jay, and I am delighted to say that I have two holes in the partition instead of one. My natural sense of humor has led me into the pardonable extravagance of giving them both appropriate names. One I call my peep-hole, and the other my pipe-hole. The name of the first explains itself; {{the name of the}} second refers to a small tin pipe or tube inserted in the hole, and twisted so that the mouth of it comes close to my ear while I am standing at my post of observation. Thus, while <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> Mr. Jay through my peep-hole, I can hear every word that may be spoken in his room through my pipe-hole.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] {{she murmured}} to herself, [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> my best now. I slept well last night, and a bath gives one colour, and white is so becoming. Still, I don't know why I failed. She {{may be a}} little better looking, but my figure is as good. I can talk better, I have learnt how to keep a man from feeling dull, and there is my reputation. Because I played at war correspondence, wore a man's clothes, and didn't shriek when I was under fire, people have chosen to make a heroine of me. That should have counted for {{something}} with him--and it didn't. I could have taken my choice of any man in London--and I wanted him. And I have failed!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Mother, it was {{something}} about Tippoo attacking the Rajah of Travancore, but I did not {{pay much attention to}} it. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the servants, in their curious dresses." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. But that's your idea. Don't you {{remember}} {{you said something}} of the kind {{the night of the}} election, years ago? It occurred to me to-day, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> him." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{the subject}} dropped. We were {{silent for a}} while. She <b>was</b> thinking, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> her. On a sudden, she raised her head. Her eyes rested on me gravely.|$|R
6000|$|D'Alcacer {{brought a}} stool {{close to the}} long chair {{and sat down on}} it. [...] "Oh, yes, the {{possible}} hour of fate," [...] he said. [...] "I have a request to make, Mrs. Travers. I don't ask you to betray anything. What would be the good? The issue when it comes will be plain enough. But I should like to get a warning, just something that would give me time to pull myself together, to compose myself as it were. I want you to promise me that if the balance tips against us you will give me a sign. You could, for instance, seize the opportunity when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> you to put your left hand to your forehead like this. It is a gesture that I have never seen you make, and so. [...] ." ...|$|E
60|$|Livy {{is willing}} to come here with me next April and stay several months--so I am going home next Tuesday. I would sail on Saturday, {{but that is the}} day of the Lord Mayor's annual grand state dinner, when they say 900 of the great men of the city sit down to table, a great many of them in their fine {{official}} and court paraphernalia, so I must not miss it. However, I may yet change my mind and sail Saturday. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> a fine Magic lantern which will cost a deal of money, and if I buy it Sammy may come and learn to make the gas and work the machinery, and paint pictures for it on glass. I mean to give exhibitions for charitable purposes in Hartford, and charge a dollar a head.|$|E
60|$|Oct. 20.--A clear, crispy day--dry and breezy air, full of oxygen. Out of the sane, silent, {{beauteous}} miracles that {{envelope and}} fuse me--trees, water, grass, sunlight, and early frost--the one <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> most to-day is the sky. It has that delicate, transparent blue, peculiar to autumn, {{and the only}} clouds are little or larger white ones, giving their still and spiritual motion to the great concave. All through the earlier day (say from 7 to 11) it keeps a pure, yet vivid blue. But as noon approaches the color gets lighter, quite gray {{for two or three}} hours--then still paler for a spell, till sun-down--which last I watch dazzling through the interstices of a knoll of big trees--darts of fire and a gorgeous show of light-yellow, liver-color and red, with a vast silver glaze askant on the water--the transparent shadows, shafts, sparkle, and vivid colors beyond all the paintings ever made.|$|E
6000|$|Rollo <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> it very wishfully, and the {{corporal}} {{told him}} that he might try it if he chose. “Wheel it about,” said he, “while your father and <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the chaise.” ...|$|R
60|$|Whilst <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the books, {{the door}} opened, and the Count entered. He saluted me in a hearty way, {{and hoped that}} I had had a good night's rest. Then he went on.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} to give you any offence," [...] Richard began. [...] "I {{happened}} to notice that you <b>were</b> watching me. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> your daughter--staring at her. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> afraid you thought me impertinent." ...|$|R
