40|$|Abstract The {{attendance}} {{of the demand}} for freight transport {{is related to the}} process of allocation of the wagons that in turn is associated with {{the way in which the}} decision is taken. The <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> to the shipment terminals depends on the planning as well as on movement of the empty wagons. In addition, the trips of the empty wagons have the major financial impact on the railroad system. In such a way, an efficient mechanism of wagon distribution is vital to the railroads, because it provides important operational profits and of costs. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze the problem related to the distribution of the load wagons and to develop a mathematical model that can propose an optimal scheduling of the wagons...|$|E
40|$|O atendimento da demanda de transporte de carga estÃ relacionado ao processo de alocaÃÃo do vagÃo, que por sua vez, estÃ associado Ã maneira pela qual a decisÃo Ã tomada. A distribuiÃÃo dos vagÃes aos terminais de carregamento depende do planejamento e da movimentaÃÃo dos vagÃes vazios, sendo a viagem deste, a parcela de maior impacto financeiro sobre o sistema ferroviÃrio. Desta forma, um mecanismo eficiente de distribuiÃÃo de vagÃo Ã vital para as estradas de ferro, pois proporciona importantes ganhos operacionais e de custos. Assim, o propÃsito deste trabalho Ã analisar o problema relacionado Ã distribuiÃÃo dos vagÃes de carga e desenvolver modelos em ProgramaÃÃo Linear Inteira, que ofereÃam ao analista a oportunidade de conhecer em detalhes, (em um nÃvel tÃtico e operacional), as dificuldades enfrentadas pela ferrovia, bem como avaliar a proposiÃÃo de metas dos tempos de retenÃÃo em pÃtios, tempos de deslocamento, nÃmero de vagÃes retidos para manutenÃÃo, necessidade do aumento da frota e, atÃ mesmo, a rentabilidade das demandas ou a viabilidade de execuÃÃo do programa de transporte diante das premissas operacionais em vigorLoad {{transportation}} attendance for {{demand is}} related to the process <b>of</b> <b>wagon</b> allocation that in its turn, is associated with the way by which the decision is taken.

The running smoothness <b>of</b> the freight <b>wagon</b> is evaluated considering the parameters of vibrations and the oscillation process.

Four-axle freight wagon movement down the track taking into account the given vertical and lateral irregularities has been simulated using software package “Universal Mechanism”. The dependencies of the oscillation amplitudes <b>of</b> the <b>wagon</b> body on track irregularities and vertical and lateral suspension settings have been defined.

FlexCargoRail can enhance flexibility <b>of</b> single <b>wagon</b> transport due to the possibility for shunting without a shunting engine. Just-in-time delivery to the loading place is possible from a central point of the siding. A target-costing calculation is made to identify maximum of possible investment cost for each FCR wagon. The maximum investment depends on the number <b>of</b> <b>wagon</b> uses per year {{and the rate of}} FCR and conventional (not propelled) Wagons. Critical is to reduce time <b>of</b> circulation <b>of</b> <b>wagons.</b> This leads to conception of direct trains between sidings or regional bundling sites, For this a calculation for minimum number <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> for cost savings of direct trains in comparison with single wagon transport is made.
