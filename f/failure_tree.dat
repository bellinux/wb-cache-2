In light of the heightened climate of litigation in the United States, and the complexity of reliably predicting <b>tree</b> <b>failure,</b> additional studies are justified.

40|$|Abstract: Solution and landsliding, the {{dominant}} erosion processes in undisturbed forested mountainous watersheds, are both influenced by subsurface drainage. Biological processes that generate organic acids accelerate loss of dissolved solids by promoting {{the dissolution of}} primary minerals in granitic rock. These organic acids can also disperse the secondary minerals, kaolinite and ferric hydroxide. This accelerates erosion by subsurface drainage through suffusion and piping, particularly in well-drained, gap-graded soils. Solution, suffusion, and piping on steep slopes can promote conditions suitable for debris avalanches by forming weak, permeable zones. Consequently, subsurface drainage shapes topography over time, from the slow continual dissolution of rock to rapid episodic mass <b>failures.</b> <b>Trees</b> reduce the ratio of physical to chemical erosion while timber harvesting increases it...|$|R

In particular, the European structural standards Eurocodes recommend a structural design to be sufficiently safe against accidental or abnormal loads not explicitly considered in the design.

In order to identify the probabilistically most dominant failure mechanisms starting from a local failure, <b>failure</b> <b>tree</b> methods are used, such as the branch and bound method, the β-unzipping method, and an original approach combining the concepts of β unzipping with some bounding process.

Considering this reference path, some robustness indices are proposed to quantify the gap between local and global failures. The proposed approach is applied to the structural analysis of a prestressed beam.

The root of the tree is a fusion center making an overall decision. Every other node is a relay node that aggregates the messages received from its child nodes into a new message and sends it up toward the fusion center. We derive upper and lower bounds for the total error probability as explicit functions of in the case where nodes and links fail with certain probabilities. These characterize the asymptotic decay rate of the total error probability as goes to infinity. Naturally, this decay rate is not larger than that in the non-failure case, which is. However, we derive an explicit necessary and sufficient condition on the decay rate of the local failure probabilities (combination of node and link failure probabilities at each level) such that the decay rate of the total error probability in the failure case is the same as that of the non-failure case.

Our main results are as follows. We present an algorithm that for every n-vertex graph G and source node s constructs a (single edge <b>failure)</b> FT-BFS <b>tree</b> rooted at s with O(n ·{(s), √(n) }) edges, where (s) is the depth of the BFS tree rooted at s.

We then consider fault-tolerant multi-source BFS trees, or FT-MBFS trees for short, aiming to provide (following a <b>failure)</b> a BFS <b>tree</b> rooted at each source s∈ S for some subset of sources S⊆ V.

40|$|Nowadays, in {{the large}} ships the {{electric}} propulsion solution is {{a viable alternative to}} the mechanical one. In fact, at present the latter is limited only to ships with peculiar requirements, such as the need of a high cruise speed or use of specific fuels. The use of electric propulsion, paired with progressive electrification of onboard loads, led to the birth of the All Electric Ship (AES) concept. An AES is a ship where all onboard loads (propulsion included) are electrically powered by a single power system, called Integrated Power System (IPS). The IPS is a key system in an AES, thus requiring both accurate design and management. Indeed, in AES electricity powers almost everything, highlighting the issue of guaranteeing both the proper Power Quality and Continuity of Service. The design of such a complex system has been conventionally done considering all the single components separately, to simplify the process. However, such practice leads to poor performance, integration issues, and oversizing. Moreover, the separate design procedure affects heavily system's reliability, due to the difficulty in assessing the effect on the ship of a fault in a single subsystem. For these reasons, a new design process is needed, able to consider the effect of all components and subsystems on the system, thus improving the ship design's most important drivers: efficiency, effectiveness, reliability, and cost saving. Therefore, the aim of the research has been to obtain a new design methodology, applicable to the AES’ IPS, which is able to consider the systems as a whole, with all its internal interdependencies. The results of such research are depicted in this thesis work, as a sub-process to be integrated into IPS’s design process. In this thesis, a wide review {{of the state of the}} art is done, to allow understanding the context, why such innovative process is needed, and which innovative techniques can be used as an aid in design. Each point is discussed focusing on the aim of this thesis, thus presenting topics, bibliography, and personal evaluations tailored to direct the reader to comprehend the impact of the proposed design process. In particular, after a first chapter dedicated to the introduction of All Electric Ships, in which are described how such ships have evolved, and what are the most impacting applications, a reasoned discussion on the conventional ship-design process is given in the second chapter. In addition to that, an in-depth analysis of the IPS design is done, to explain the context in which the proposed innovative design process has to be integrated. Several examples of issues coming from the conventional design process are given, to motivate the proposal of a new design process. Not only the above mentioned design issues, but also the upcoming introduction of innovative distribution systems onboard ships and the recent emergence of new requirements, whose impact on IPS is significant, are motivations calling for a new design process. Due to that, an excursus of both these two topics is given in the third chapter, referring to recent literature and research activities. Chapter four is dedicated to the description of the tools that will be used to build the innovative design process. The first part is dedicated to dependability theory, which is able to give a systematic and coherent approach to the determination of faults effects on complex systems. Through dependability theory and its techniques, it is possible: to assess the effect of single components faults on the overall system; to assess all the possible causes of a given system failure; to evaluate mathematical figures related to the system in order to compare different design solutions; and to define where the designer must intervene to improve the system. The second part of the fourth chapter is dedicated to power system’s software simulators and hardware in the loop testing. In particular, the use of such systems as an aid in designing power systems is discussed, to allow comprehending why such tools have been integrated in the innovative design process developed. The fifth chapter is dedicated to the developed design process. Discussion is presented on how such process work, how it should be integrated in ship design process, and which is the impact it have on the design. In particular, the developed procedure implies both the application of dependability theory techniques (in particular <b>Failure</b> <b>Tree</b> Analysis), and the simulation of the dynamic behavior of the power system through a mathematical model of the system tailored on electromechanical transients. Finally, to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed procedure, in chapter six a case of study has been analyzed: the IPS of a Dynamic Positioned Offshore Oil & Gas drillship. This has been done due to the stringent requirements these ships have, whose impact on power system’s design is significant. The analysis of the IPS done through the Fault Tree Analysis technique is presented (though using a simplified detail level), followed by the calculation of several dependability indexes. Such results, together with applicable rules and regulations, have been used to define the input data for simulations, carried out using a mathematical model of the IPS built on purpose. Simulations outcomes have been used in turn to evaluate the dynamic processes bringing the system from relevant faults to failure, in order to improve the system’s response to the fault events. ...|$|E
