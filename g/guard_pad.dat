2500|$|In May 1980, Mazda {{released}} a {{limited production run}} of special North American models known as the Leathersport Models. This package was essentially an uprated GS model with added LS badges on each B-pillar, special striping, and LS-only gold anodized wheels (with polished outer face and wheel rim). All LS editions came equipped with special LS-only full brown leather upholstery, leather wrapped steering wheel, leather wrapped shift knob, removable sunroof, LS-specific four-speaker AM/FM stereo radio with power antenna (though listed as a six speaker stereo, as the two rear dual voice coil speakers were counted as four speakers in total), remote power door side mirrors, and other standard GS equipment. Two primary options were also available; a three-speed JATCO 3N71B automatic transmission and air conditioning. Other GS options such as cassette tape deck, splash <b>guards,</b> <b>padded</b> center console arm rest and others could be added by the dealer. The LS model was only ever available in three different exterior colors: Aurora White, Brilliant Black, and Solar Gold. No official production records are known to exist or to have been released. This series of RX-7 had exposed steel bumpers and a high-mounted indentation-located license plate, called by Werner Buhrer of Road & Track magazine a [...] "Baroque depression." ...|$|R

Additional gear that is acceptable though subject to individual team rules include padded knee length pants, similar to what aggressive skateboarders wear, and biologically specific gear such as a hard case sports bra for female players and protective cups for males.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two common}} types of foils, the nonelectric foil—also known as [...] "steam" [...] or [...] "dry"—and the electric. The {{components}} common to both varieties are the pommel, grip, <b>guard,</b> thumb <b>pad,</b> and blade. The blades of both varieties are capped {{with a plastic}} or rubber piece, with a button at the tip in electric blades, that provides information when the blade tip touches the opponent. (There are also a range of plastic swords made by varying manufacturers for use by juniors.) Lacking the button and associated electrical mechanism, a judge is required to determine the scoring and the victor in a tournaments with nonelectric foils.|$|R

5000|$|The 2007 rulebook {{has seen}} major changes {{regarding}} goalkeepers. A fully equipped goalkeeper must wear a helmet, leg guards and kickers. Usually the field hockey goalkeepers must wear extensive additional protective equipment including chest <b>guards,</b> <b>padded</b> shorts, heavily padded hand protectors, groin protectors, neck guards, arm guards, {{and like all}} players, they must carry a stick. A goalie may not cross the 23 m line, the sole exception to this being if the goalkeeper {{is to take a}} penalty stroke {{at the other end of}} the field, when the clock is stopped. The goalkeeper can also remove their helmet for this action. However, if the goalkeeper elects to wear only a helmet (and a different colored shirt), they may cross the 23 m line if they have removed their helmet (and placed it safely off the field of play). If play returns to the circle without them having opportunity to replace the helmet, this player still has [...] "goalkeeping privileges", that is, they are not limited to using their stick to play the ball whilst it is in the circle, and the helmet must be worn whilst defending penalty corners and penalty strokes but the best thing to do would be to wear it at all times. While goaltenders are allowed to use their feet and hands to clear the ball, they too are only allowed to use one side of their stick. Slide tackling is permitted as long as it is with the intention of clearing the ball, not aimed at a player.|$|R
50|$|A shin <b>guard</b> or shin <b>pad</b> is a {{piece of}} {{equipment}} worn on the front of a player’s shin to protect them from injury. These are commonly used in sports including association football (soccer), baseball, ice hockey, field hockey, lacrosse, rugby, cricket, and other sports. This is due to either being required by the rules/laws of the sport or worn voluntarily by the participants for protective measures.|$|R

50|$|Protective {{equipment}} in gridiron football ("football gear") consists of equipment worn by football players {{for the protection}} of the body during the course of a football game. Basic equipment worn by most football players include helmet, shoulder pads, gloves, shoes, and thigh and knee pads, and a jockstrap or compression shorts with or without a protective cup. Neck rolls, elbow <b>pads,</b> mouth <b>guards,</b> hip <b>pads,</b> tailbone pads, rib pads, and other equipment may be worn in addition to the aforementioned basics. Football protective equipment is made of synthetic materials: foam rubbers, elastics, and durable, shock-resistant, molded plastic. Football protective equipment has remained consistent in use for decades with some slight modifications made over the years in design and materials. The assignment and maintenance of football gear belongs to the team equipment manager.|$|R

50|$|Ancillary player {{equipment}} {{has also}} changed. The studded boots for grass fields are banned (and were {{in any case}} very uncomfortable) on synthetics, and have been replaced with boots specifically designed for synthetic turf. Shin <b>guards</b> have improved <b>padding.</b> Many players have taken to wearing padded gloves, particularly on their left hand, both to protect against contact {{and allow them to}} scrape that hand (while holding the stick) across the synthetic turf without injury. Finally, the wearing of mouthguards to protect the teeth is now compulsory for safety in many countries.|$|R
50|$|Riverboarders {{typically}} wear fins {{to provide}} the thrust to navigate in river currents, while a personal flotation device provides additional buoyancy. Wetsuits, booties and helmets are worn as protection from the cold and from rocks. Additionally, shin <b>guards,</b> gloves, knee <b>pads,</b> thigh pads, and elbow pads are sometimes worn for extra protection on shallow rivers. Instruction, board design, and gear continue to improve, making riverboarding safer and opening up the possibilities of rapids that can be run on a riverboard and new tricks that can be performed while surfing on the belly.|$|R

5000|$|Cooperalls were {{designed}} by Brian Heaton, the senior designer for Cooper Canada from 1972 to 1975. Promoted as [...] "a complete hockey uniform system" [...] it consisted of an elasticated girdle extending {{from the middle of}} the rib cage to the top of the knees, worn beneath a tracksuit-style woven nylon outer shell covering waist to ankle. The girdle had pockets in to which lightweight, compression moulded foam pads were placed and the close fitting nature of the garment ensured that the pads always stayed in contact with the areas of the body they {{were designed}} to protect. This replaced the traditional combination of short hockey pants and socks, and Cooper claimed that when combined with their own brand of extra light shin <b>guards,</b> shoulder <b>pads</b> and gloves the system weighed 40% less than a conventional uniform. As well as being considerably lighter, the system offered players greater freedom of movement and improved hip, pelvis and thigh protection.|$|R
5000|$|The ‘helmet culture’ is more {{prevalent}} in longboarding than in skateboarding. Most riders wear protective equipment in all disciplines, and nearly all professionals wear a helmet and gloves. Longboard protective equipment is similar to standard skateboard equipment, {{with the exception of}} slide gloves. Most longboarders wear slide gloves and helmets, as these are considered the bare minimum for protection. Additional protection includes: leathers, wrist <b>guards,</b> knee <b>pads,</b> elbow pads and sometimes spine protectors and padded shorts. Many professional longboarding teams and riders are required to wear and advocate all aspects of protection. In the sliding and downhill disciplines, riders wear [...] "slide gloves" [...] which are specialized gloves made out of a strong materials such as leather and synthetic fabrics, and have large discs called [...] "pucks" [...] attached to the palms. These are attached to protect the hands as the rider uses them to pivot during slides along the ground. The pucks are usually made of synthetic polymers: delrin, UHMW, or corian.|$|R

In women's lacrosse, thigh <b>pads,</b> shin <b>guards</b> and elbow <b>pads</b> are common. Women's lacrosse prohibits jewelry, except for religious purposes. In men's lacrosse, a protective groin cup {{is required}} for all players. Goaltenders also have a larger crosse (the head of a lacrosse stick) than the other players. This {{makes it easier to}} save shots. The downside is that it can be harder to cradle and pass the ball to another player/teammate.|$|R
40|$|SummaryPurpose:To provide {{information}} on the incidence, types and circumstances of injuries sustained {{in a group of}} young people with epilepsy using protective helmets. Methods:Thirty-three residential students (21 M, 12 F, age range 5 – 21, mean 14. 5 years) attending a special epilepsy centre over 1 year were provided with helmets. The types of protective measures, seizure frequency, types of injuries, circumstances and outcome were recorded. Results:Fourteen thousand seven hundred and fifty-one seizures were recorded in the 33 patients, which resulted in 59 injuries. The seizure-related injury risk was 4 / 1000 seizures. Scalp and facial bruises were the commonest injury (51 %). Additional protective measures, such as bed <b>guards</b> and <b>padding</b> of dinner tables and sinks, were used for 57 % of these students. Helmets were in use in 46 % of the accidents; 68 % of these accidents resulted in facial or scalp injuries, which required medical attention in 48 %. Helmets were not in use in 41 % of accidents; 57 % of these accidents resulted in facial or scalp injuries, which required medical attention in 36 %. Data on wearing of helmets in the accidents were unavailable in 13 %. Conclusions:Injuries continue to occur despite the use of helmets. Changes to the helmet design and modifications to suit the seizure type may improve the protection offered by helmets...|$|R

500|$|Football is a full-contact sport, and {{injuries}} are relatively common. Most injuries occur during training sessions, particularly ones that involve contact between players. To {{try to prevent}} injuries, players are required to wear a set of equipment. At a minimum players must wear a football helmet {{and a set of}} shoulder pads, but individual leagues may require additional padding such as thigh <b>pads</b> and <b>guards,</b> knee <b>pads,</b> chest protectors, and mouthguards. Most injuries occur in the lower extremities, particularly in the knee, but a significant number also affect the upper extremities. The most common types of injuries are strains, sprains, bruises, fractures, dislocations, and concussions. Repeated concussions can increase a person's risk in later life for chronic traumatic encephalopathy and mental health issues such as dementia, Parkinson's disease, and depression. Concussions are often caused by helmet-to-helmet or upper-body contact between opposing players, although helmets have prevented more serious injuries such as skull fractures. Various programs are aiming to reduce concussions by reducing the frequency of helmet-to-helmet hits; USA Football's [...] "Heads Up Football" [...] program is aiming to reduce concussions in youth football by teaching coaches and players about the signs of a concussion, the proper way to wear football equipment and ensure it fits, and proper tackling methods that avoid helmet-to-helmet contact. However, a study in the Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine found that Heads Up Football was ineffective; the same study noted that more extensive reforms implemented by Pop Warner Little Scholars and its member teams were effective in significantly reducing concussion rates.|$|R
5000|$|In field hockey, the goalkeeper {{generally}} wears extensive protective equipment including helmet, {{face and}} neck guards, chest and leg padding, arm or elbow protectors, special gloves (the left glove is designed purely to block the ball, the right glove also has this function but in addition is designed to permit the goalkeeper to hold and use his or her stick), lower leg <b>guards</b> (known as <b>pads)</b> and shoe covers (known as kickers). The gloves, pads and kickers are almost always made of special high density foam material that both protects the goalkeeper and has excellent rebound qualities. He or she is also equipped with a stick; either one designed for goalies or one as used for normal play. Specialist goalkeeper sticks must conform to the same dimensional limitations as field players' sticks but are designed for optimal use {{with one hand and}} for blocking rather than hitting the ball. From 2007 teams may elect to play with 11 field players, and no-one has the privileges of a goalkeeper. If a goalkeeper is used, they fall into one of two categories: a fully equipped goalkeeper must wear a helmet, unless they are nominated to take a penalty stroke against the opposing goalkeeper, wear a different colored shirt and at least foot and leg guards (arm and upper-body protection is optional); or they may opt to wear only a helmet. The goalkeeper is allowed to use any part of their body to play or deflect the ball, although they can't obstruct its play (for example by lying on top of it), and they can only do so within the goal circle (or [...] "D"). Outside the D they are subject to the same rules as field players and may only use their stick to play the ball. Goalkeepers who are wearing a helmet are not permitted to pass their team's 23 m line, with the exception of goalkeepers who take penalty strokes. However a goalkeeper who has elected to wear only a helmet is permitted to remove it and provided it is not left on the field of play, they may take part in the game in any part of the pitch, and retain their goalkeeping privileges, even if they do not have time to replace the helmet before making a save. It is compulsory to wear a helmet when defending a penalty stroke or penalty corner.|$|R
