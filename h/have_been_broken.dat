5|$|The {{reality of}} defeat for Austria caused a reevaluation of {{internal}} divisions, local autonomy, and liberalism. The new North German Confederation {{had its own}} constitution, flag, and governmental and administrative structures. Through military victory, Prussia under Bismarck's influence had overcome Austria's active resistance {{to the idea of}} a unified Germany. Austria's influence over the German states may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>broken,</b> but the war also splintered the spirit of pan-German unity: most of the German states resented Prussian power politics.|$|E
5|$|In the 4th century, the Roman army {{underwent}} a radical restructuring. In {{the rule of}} Diocletian (284–305), the traditional Principate formations of legiones, alae and cohortes appear to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>broken</b> up into smaller units, many of which bore {{a variety of new}} names. Under Constantine I (r. 312–337) it appears that military units were classified into three grades based on strategic role and to some extent quality: palatini, elite units normally part of the exercitus praesentales (imperial escort armies); comitatenses, higher-grade interception forces based in frontier provinces; and limitanei, lower-grade border troops. (See Late Roman army).|$|E

5|$|In the Republic of Ireland, {{counties}} {{form the}} basis of the system of local government. Counties Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Tipperary <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>broken</b> up into smaller administrative areas. However, they are still treated as counties for cultural and some official purposes, for example postal addresses and by the Ordnance Survey Ireland. Counties in Northern Ireland are no longer used for local governmental purposes, but, as in the Republic, their traditional boundaries are still used for informal purposes such as sports leagues and in cultural or tourism contexts.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of the asteroid belt after Late Heavy Bombardment was mainly governed by collisions. Objects with large mass have enough gravity to retain any material ejected by a violent collision. In the asteroid belt this usually is not the case. As a result, many larger objects <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>broken</b> apart, and sometimes newer objects have been forged from the remnants in less violent collisions. Moons around some asteroids currently can only be explained as consolidations of material flung away from the parent object without enough energy to entirely escape its gravity.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the name of the pub is unclear, but one {{reported}} theory is that it was named after the 17th-century warship HMS Royal Oak, which was sunk at the nearby Raid on the Medway in 1664. Local people say that one of the beams in the pub comes from the ship, the remains of which may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>broken</b> up at a nearby shipyard after the battle. Another theory is that it was named after the Royal Oak that Charles II of England hid in following the Battle of Worcester.|$|E

5|$|The stones {{themselves}} are small; on average they measure 0.1 metre (4 inches) in height, 0.3 metre (one foot) in width, and 0.1 metres (4 inches) thick. The largest stands approximately 0.5 metres (1.6 feet) above the ground. Most are incomplete, and likely <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>broken</b> since the original erection of the circle. Although {{it is not}} known if all the stones in the circle come from the same natural rock, a sample was taken from one stone and under examination revealed to be a hard, pale grey gritstone, likely taken from the nearby Pickwell Down grits. There are conspicuous quartz veins in many of the circle's stones.|$|E
5|$|Beetle fossils are {{abundant}} in the Cenozoic; by the Quaternary (up to 1.6 mya), fossil species are identical to living ones, while from the Late Miocene (5.7 mya) the fossils are still so close to modern forms that they are most likely the ancestors of living species. The large oscillations in climate during the Quaternary caused beetles to change their geographic distributions so much that current location gives little clue to the biogeographical history of a species. It is evident that geographic isolation of populations must often <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>broken</b> as insects moved {{under the influence of}} changing climate, causing mixing of gene pools, rapid evolution, and extinctions, especially in middle latitudes.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 McCaw {{played for}} the All Blacks against the touring Ireland team (15–6 and 40–8 victories) and in the TriNations against Australia and South Africa. Of the six 2002 test matches McCaw played in, five were won by New Zealand with the only loss to Australia. The 14–16 loss {{occurred}} in New Zealand's third TriNations match and ensured the Bledisloe Cup stayed with Australia. During the All Blacks match against South Africa in Durban a pitch invader attacked Irish referee David McHugh as a scrum was being set, dislocating his shoulder in the process. McCaw and A.J. Venter wrestled the assailant off the referee and, according to McHugh, {{if they had not}} got involved his shoulder would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>broken.</b> McCaw was rested, along with 20 other members of the TriNations squad, from the 2002 end-of-year tour to Europe.|$|E

5|$|In 1986 Charig and Milner first {{suggested}} that its elongated snout with many finely serrated teeth indicated that Baryonyx was piscivorous (a fish-eater), speculating that it crouched on a riverbank and used its claw to gaff {{fish out of}} the water (similar to the modern grizzly bear). In 1984, Taquet pointed out that the spinosaurid snouts from Niger were {{similar to those of the}} modern gharial and suggested a behaviour similar to herons or storks. In 1997 Charig and Milner rejected their initial proposal that the articulation between the premaxilla and maxilla was mobile. In 1987 Andrew Kitchener disputed the piscivorous behaviour of Baryonyx and {{suggested that}} it would have been a scavenger, using its long neck to feed on the ground, its claws to break into a carcass, and its long snout (with nostrils far back for breathing) for investigating the body cavity. Kitchener argued that Baryonyx jaws and teeth were too weak to kill other dinosaurs and too heavy to catch fish, with too many adaptations for piscivory. According to R. E. H. Reid, a scavenged carcass would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>broken</b> up by its predator and large animals capable of doing so—such as grizzly bears—are also capable of catching fish (at least in shallow water).|$|E
5|$|In June 1999, Chyna {{became the}} first woman to qualify for the King of the Ring tournament. She was also the first female to be the number one {{contender}} for the WWF Championship, but lost the spot to Mankind before SummerSlam in August. Later that year, Laurer became a fan favorite again during her long feud with Jeff Jarrett. At Unforgiven, she had a match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship against Jarrett, which she lost. She defeated Jarrett for the title at No Mercy in his last WWF match, a Good Housekeeping match, on October 17 at No Mercy, in the process becoming the first and only woman to win the Intercontinental Championship. She also gained the services of his valet, Miss Kitty. Laurer claims that Jarrett demanded (and received) $300,000 from Vince McMahon in order to lose the title cleanly to a woman. His contract had expired on October 16, and he was therefore not contractually obligated to appear on the pay-per-view. If he had not appeared, the WWF would have been criticized for false advertising, and the lineage of the title would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>broken.</b>|$|E
