They wonder to what extent MRP can provide support for JIT production. This paper describes how JIT can be embedded into MRP. A three-step framework is described which makes use of MRP's backflushing and phantom features, and permits JIT principles to be used to the furthest extent possible. The JIT benefits that will be reported by MRP, as well as those that remain hidden because of MRP, are outlined. Observations from work with North American and Western European manufacturers are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} cache {{performance}} of Java {{programs in the}} interpreted and <b>just-in</b> <b>time</b> (<b>JIT)</b> modes by analyzing memory reference traces of the SPECjvm 98 applications with the Latte JVM. Specifically, we study the cache performance of the different components of the JVM (class loader, the execution engine and the garbage collector). Poor data cache performance in JITs is caused by code installation, and the data write miss rate can {{be as high as}} 70 % in the execution engine. In addition, this code installation also causes deterioration in performance of the instruction cache during execution of translated code. We also believe that there is considerable interference between data accesses of the garbage collector and that of the compiler-translator execution engine of the JIT mode. We observe that the miss percentages in the garbage collection phase are of the order of 60 % for the JIT mode; we believe that interference between data accesses of the garbage collector and the JIT execution engine lead to further deterioration of the data cache performance wherever the contribution of the garbage collector is significant. We observe that an increase in cache sizes does not substantially improve performance in the case of data cache writes, which is identified to be the principal performance bottleneck in JITs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract OnlyConsumers {{all over}} the world have a strong {{preference}} for fresh newly harvested fish, which is reflected in a higher market value compared to most other preserved and processed fish products. The perishability of the fresh fish and the distribution distance drive in contrary the fish value chains into preservation like freezing, salting, drying, canning etc. This paper reports findings from a research project where a new Coolnova <b>just-in</b> <b>time</b> (<b>JIT)</b> marketing concept has been unveiled. This concept opens a new window of opportunity for marketing fresh quality previous frozen thawed fish on daily basis just-in -time for consumption with a quality appearance like fresh fish. The fresh appearance is protected in a humid atmosphere consisting of small fog droplet which is speeding up the freezing and thawing process without any risk of dehydration or microbe degradation of the product and without any loss of drip and weight which is normal for fish frozen and thawed in traditional ways. Application of the Coolnova JIT logistic concept has the potential to revolutionize the way we are marketing fresh quality seafood, satisfying the consumer preferences for fresh fish and food welfare. The fishers’ opportunities to add value of fresh caught fish may thus be increased when the fresh quality is protected in a value chain and when the barriers that today exist in the fresh seafood distribution chains are removed by the Coolnova JIT system...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{aimed at}} {{designing}} {{and developing a}} system that can a) infer individuals’ need for a break from sedentary behaviour in the workplace, and b) persuade them {{to take a break}} through the use of different techniques from persuasive psychology. We postulated three variables, namely, individuals’ posture, stress levels and involvement in their computer mediated activity. We developed and field-studied a system that could infer these using a web camera and a key presses and mouse clicks log. We found that the system could predict posture from viewing depth and stress from the movement detected. We then created a general formula that predicts individuals’ need for a break using only the posture and stress predictors. Once the first objective was set, we built and field-studied a system that used three ways to communicate a recommendation for a break to a user: implicit, <b>just-in</b> <b>time</b> and ambient feedback. The implicit feedback was operationalized through changes in the users’ computer wallpaper that provided subtle visual cues. The <b>just-in</b> <b>time</b> feedback employed prompting at the bottom right side of the user’s screen. In addition, we implemented an intuitive behind-screen interaction technique where people can snooze a notification using simple gestures. The ambient feedback mechanism employed an origami sculpture sitting on the user’s desk. This prototype was continuously reflecting the user’s posture and performed rhythmic movements when to recommend breaks. A field study demonstrated the overall success of the system, with 69 % of the break recommendations received by users were accepted. The study further revealed {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the three persuasive mechanisms...|$|R
