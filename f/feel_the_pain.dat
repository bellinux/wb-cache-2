5|$|To {{demonstrate}} Henry's immortality, Miller {{decided that}} Henry would die and would <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> {{every time he}} died. Anything on Henry's body would disappear with his body during each death. Miller felt that Henry's naked rebirth in water would be an interesting {{way to keep the}} show's protagonist alive during the series by completing the death and rebirth process; the nakedness would create several comedic moments within the series. Miller intended to use Henry's death and rebirth process sporadically after the first two episodes so that the series would focus on Henry's long life.|$|E

500|$|It was a {{night of}} {{contrasting}} emotions at Home Park. A 2–0 win for the visitors confirmed Argyle's relegation to League One and Newcastle's promotion back to the Premier League as champions at the first attempt. Hours after the match, the club's board declared that it remained determined to steer {{it to the top}} flight of English football. Paul Mariner reaffirmed his commitment to the club, vowing to put things right. [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> of the supporters because this is the club that gave me my first start," [...] he said. [...] "The reason I came here was because of the vision that the club can get into the Premiership. Now we've got another couple of hurdles before we do that but I firmly believe that we can do it." [...] Argyle's penultimate game of the season took place at the City Ground against Nottingham Forest, who had already qualified for the play-off's, and they secured a comfortable 3–0 victory against the relegated side. The club signed off their campaign with another home defeat against Peterborough United on 2 May. Argyle took the lead in the first-half from a fine individual goal from Wright-Phillips but conceded two goals after the break to Craig Mackail-Smith. Four days later, the club announced that they would be searching for a new manager, with Paul Mariner reverting to his original role as head coach. He said: [...] "I am disappointed that we could not produce the results we wanted last season. I am a realist and understand why and how the board came to the conclusion they have done. I am committed to this club and want only to help it regain Championship status as soon as possible and build on that." [...] Work on a new state-of-the-art Fibrelastic pitch at Home Park began the following week.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé's {{version of}} [...] "Resentment" [...] {{received}} positive reviews from critics, {{most of whom}} noted the soulful vocal stylings used in the song. Bill Lamb of About.com complimented the song {{as one of the}} album highlights and described it as [...] "gospel-influenced" [...] and [...] "emotion filled" [...] song. A writer of Billboard magazine stated that Beyoncé [...] "shifts into emotive mode" [...] on this song from [...] "rockier, edgier" [...] sound of album and noted that the track [...] "calls to mind the subtle fervor and passion of the best girl groups of the '60s and '70s". Brian Hiatt from Rolling Stone marked the track as [...] "one of the most arresting moments" [...] on the album and described it as an [...] "anguished, sixties-tinged ballad". Spence Abbott of IGN also noted track as a stand out alongside [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] and observed that [...] " [...] track goes straight for Aretha Franklin-inspired territory, with Beyoncé actually getting gritty and dropping her high octave range down a few pegs to get guttural and downright Old School soulful". Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated that the [...] "agitated goodbye" [...] builds a different kind of overwrought drama. Steve Jones of USA Today the song showcases Beyoncé's [...] "maturing vocal chops," [...] describing the song as spare and gritty. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine noted that the song would have been better if performed by a trio of [...] "talented" [...] vocalists, such as Destiny's Child, rather than Beyoncé by herself. Houston Chronicles Joey Guerra felt that [...] "Doubters of Beyoncé's immense talent need only give one listen to this track [...] from 2006's B'Day. It's a stunner — a visceral, emotional showcase that casts Beyoncé as a scorned, sorrowful woman. You can almost <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> in her delivery." [...] According to a writer of Irish Independent, the song gives a more soulful feel to B'Day. Jim Farber of Daily News called [...] "Resentment" [...] an [...] "old-school soul shouter". Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker described the song as a [...] "fierce ballad". [...] "Resentment" [...] peaked at number 11 on the US Bubbling Under R/Hip-Hop Singles chart, which acts as an extension to the Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs.|$|E
500|$|Musically, {{the album}} sees the band {{moving away from}} nu metal and {{focusing}} on a style categorized as groove metal. With strong elements of groove metal on the album, All Hope is Gone also features elements of death metal and thrash metal. Magazine Yell! wrote that All Hope is Gone [...] "expands on" [...] Slipknot's [...] "thrash metal guitar work and vocal melodies." [...] Prior to the album's release, Slipknot's members displayed interest in making All Hope Is Gone their heaviest album, which Joey Jordison affirmed saying, [...] "It's going to be heavier than , but just as weird and as experimental." [...] Corey Taylor reiterated this, describing All Hope Is Gone as a [...] "very dark" [...] combination of the band's two previous studio albums, Iowa and Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses). In All Hope Is Gone, Slipknot expands on their use of traditional song structures, acoustics, and solos that they introduced on their previous album Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses). The song [...] "Snuff" [...] is led by acoustic guitars and has been dubbed as Slipknot's [...] "attempt at a power ballad", though it remains [...] "dark and ominous". In an interview with Artistdirect, Shawn Crahan stated, [...] "Everyone can <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> that's in there. It's not forced upon you. You have it in there innately." [...] Slipknot also retained a metal edge reminiscent of their earlier work. Stephen Erlewine of Allmusic wrote that [...] "Gematria (The Killing Name)" [...] goes from [...] "a cluster of cacophony" [...] to [...] "an onslaught of densely dark intricate riffs". Crahan compared it to the song [...] "(sic)" [...] from their debut album, explaining, [...] "The technique and the style are very reminiscent of the old, brutal shit that we've done." [...] Jim Kaz of IGN stated that the [...] "swaggering, cock-rock groove and an anthemic chorus" [...] of [...] "Psychosocial" [...] gives Slipknot the potential {{to reach out to}} new fans [...] "without sacrificing a lick of intensity". Crahan stated he [...] "loves" [...] his parts of [...] "Psychosocial", in which the band incorporates snare drums, reminiscent of [...] "Before I Forget". He also cited [...] "This Cold Black" [...] as one of his favorite songs, saying that it has a [...] "driving tempo and a lot of attitude". The track [...] "Gehenna" [...] incorporates elements of Slipknot's slower, more cerebral edge reminiscent of [...] "Prosthetics" [...] and [...] "Purity" [...] from their debut album, and [...] "Skin Ticket" [...] from Iowa. Crahan called it a [...] "trippy song", explaining, [...] "It's just somewhere we go." ...|$|E

[...] The pain may {{be described as a}} tearing, stabbing, or sharp sensation; 17% {{of individuals}} <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> migrate as the dissection extends down the aorta. [...] The location of pain is associated with the location of the dissection. Anterior chest pain is associated with dissections involving the ascending aorta, while interscapular (back) pain is associated with descending aortic dissections. [...] If the pain is pleuritic in nature, it may suggest acute pericarditis caused by bleeding into the pericardial sac. [...] This is a particularly dangerous eventuality, suggesting that acute pericardial tamponade may be imminent. Pericardial tamponade is {{the most common cause of}} death from aortic dissection.|$|E
2500|$|Epicurus {{explicitly}} {{warned against}} overindulgence because it {{often leads to}} pain. [...] For instance, Epicurus warned against pursuing love too ardently.

When a man dies, he does not <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> of death because he no longer is and therefore feels nothing. Therefore, as Epicurus famously said, [...] "death is nothing to us." [...] When we exist, death is not; and when death exists, we are not. All sensation and consciousness ends with death and therefore in death there is neither pleasure nor pain. The fear of death arises from the belief that in death, there is awareness.|$|E

2500|$|Awareness {{occurs when}} {{patients}} have anesthesia that is inadequate {{to keep them}} unconscious during an operation. [...] The incidence of this anesthesia complication is variable and seems to affect 0.2% to 0.4% of patients according to the surgical setting carried out. This variation reflects the surgical setting {{as well as the}} physiological state of the patient. Thus, the incidence is 0.2% in general surgery, about 0.4% during caesarean section, between 1 and 2% during cardiac surgery and between 10% and 40% for anesthesia of the traumatized. The majority of these do not feel pain although around one third did, in a range of experience from a sore throat due to the endotracheal tube, to traumatic pain at the incision site. The incidence is halved in the absence of neuro-muscular blockade. In this situation, the patient may <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> or pressure of surgery, hear conversation, experience air hunger, or have difficulty breathing. The patient may be unable to communicate any distress because they have been given a muscle relaxant; without this, they can move and the anesthesiologists are alerted and provide more anesthetic drugs to render the patient unconscious again. If anesthesia awareness does occur, about 42% <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> of the operation, 94% experience panic or anxiety, and 70% experience lasting symptoms which may be psychological and may be physical or neurological. The quoted incidences are controversial as many cases of [...] "awareness" [...] are open to interpretation. These usually involve feeling severe pain, clear recall of the conversations of the operating room staff or suffocation. Some patients undergo sedation for smaller procedures such as biopsies and colonoscopies and are told they will be asleep, although in fact they are getting a sedation that may allow some level of awareness as opposed to a general anesthetic.|$|E

Dhritarashtra [...] marries Gandhari, a princess from Gandhara, who blindfolds herself so that she may <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> that her husband feels.

5000|$|The slow {{section is}} {{initially}} very beautiful, but seeping with sentimental emotion. Jaffé {{has pointed out}} that the opening theme is based on Robert Schumann's Lied, 'Wehmut' ('Sadness', which appears in Schumann's Liederkreis, Op. 39): the words to this translate [...] "I can sometimes sing as if I were glad, yet secretly tears well and so free my heart. Nightingales... sing their song of longing from their dungeon's depth... everyone delights, yet no one <b>feels</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain,</b> <b>the</b> deep sorrow in the song." [...] This opening theme quickly decays into an extremely chromatic section which sifts through various tonal centers, none of which seem familiar to the E that began the piece. After a clangorous, bell-like climax, the music slows and melts into the lush opening theme once more.|$|R
