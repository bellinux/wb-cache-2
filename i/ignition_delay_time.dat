40|$|The {{influence}} of background ionization on the ignition {{dynamics of the}} pulsed plasma plume is studied. The <b>ignition</b> <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> of each pulse is investigated by recording the voltage signal and the light emission signal. By changing the frequency, {{the relationship between the}} pulse-off time and the <b>ignition</b> <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> is revealed. This indicates that residual active species produced in the previous discharge {{play a role in the}} next one. With the decrease in the frequency, both time delay and <b>ignition</b> <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> increase. This is due to the decay of the reactive species densities in the pulse-off time.

In {{the last decade or}} so, the operating regime of shock tubes has been extended to lower temperatures by accessing longer observation times.

The purpose of this work is to measure long <b>ignition</b> <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> for fuels exhibiting negative temperature coefficient (NTC) and {{to assess the impact of}} shock tube non-idealities on <b>ignition</b> <b>delay</b> data. <b>Ignition</b> <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> of n-heptane and n-hexane were measured over the temperature range of 650 – 1250 K and pressures near 1. 5 atm. Driver gas tailoring and long length of shock tube driver section were utilized to measure <b>ignition</b> <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> as long as 32 ms. Measured <b>ignition</b> <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> agree with chemical kinetic models at high (> 1100 K) and low (< 700 K) temperatures. In the intermediate temperature range (700 – 1100 K), however, significant discrepancies are observed between the measurements and homogeneous <b>ignition</b> <b>delay</b> simulations.

For the Lur’e problem of Die-sinking EDM, we applied the SPR (Strict Positive Real) condition for the control of EDM.

The lifted flames were categorized into three regimes depending on the initial temperature and fuel mole fraction: (1) non-autoignited lifted flame, (2) autoignited lifted flame with tribrachial (or triple) edge, and (3) autoignited lifted flame with mild combustion. For the non-autoignited lifted flames at relatively low temperature, the existence of lifted flame depended on the Schmidt number of fuel, such that only the fuels with Sc > 1 exhibited stationary lifted flames. The balance mechanism between the propagation speed of tribrachial flame and local flow velocity stabilized the lifted flames.

Heating {{of shock}} tube at temperature of 150 °C {{was used to}} prepare a homogeneous fuel mixture. <b>Ignition</b> <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> were measured from OH emission at 309 nm (A 2 Σ – X 2 Π) and from absorption of He-Ne laser radiation at 3. 3922 μm. The conditions behind shock waves were calculated by one-dimensional shock wave theory from initial conditions T 1, P 1, mixture composition and incident shock wave velocity. The <b>ignition</b> <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> were obtained at two fixed pressures 10, 20 atm for lean, stoichiometric and rich mixtures (ø= 0. 5, 1, 2) at an overall temperature range of 1040 - 1380 K...|$|R

40|$|Coal {{combustion}} is {{investigated in}} both air and oxy-fuel conditions in a pilot-scale entrained flow reactor {{able to provide}} high temperatures, heating rates and residence times. Measurements are carried out with different levels of complexity and are aimed at: assessing the thermal field inside the reactor; evaluating conversions of devolatilization or char combustion tests; identifying phenomena such as volatiles ignition and measuring the <b>ignition</b> <b>delay</b> <b>time.</b> Computational Fluid Dynamics was also used {{in order to provide}} {{a better understanding of the}} experimental evidences. Among the results, the <b>ignition</b> <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> was found to be larger in oxy-fuel conditions than in air, mainly because of the larger specific heat of the oxy-fuel environment. The proposed investigation may help the qualification of advanced experimental apparatus as entrained flow reactors, with the purpose to make them suitable for heterogeneous kinetics studies in oxy-fuel conditions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} water on the {{ignition}} and combustion characteristics of single droplets of glycerol was studied experimentally. Distilled water was added into a pure glycerol at concentrations ranging from 5 % to 20 % v/v. The single droplets of glycerol with and without water addition were suspended on the tip of a silicon fibre, and ignited and combusted in air at 1023 K. The ignition and combustion processes of the single droplets were recorded using a CCD camera. The droplet size, burning rate, <b>ignition</b> <b>delay</b> <b>time,</b> burnout time, and total combustion time were determined. It was found that the burning rate and the <b>ignition</b> <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> of glycerol droplets increased with increasing water concentration. However, the addition of water in the glycerol resulted in shorter burnout times and had negligible effect on the total combustion time of the glycerol droplets...|$|E

40|$|A {{combined}} {{experimental and}} chemical kinetic modeling {{study of the}} high-temperature ignition and pyrolysis of 1, 3 -dimethylcyclohexane (13 DMCH) is presented. <b>Ignition</b> <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> are measured behind reflected shock waves over a temperature range of 1049 – 1544 K and pressures of 3. 0 – 12 atm. Pyrolysis is investigated at average pressures of 4. 0 atm at temperatures of 1238, 1302, and 1406 K. By means of mid-infrared direct laser absorption at 3. 39 μm, fuel concentration time histories are measured under ignition and pyrolytic conditions. A detailed chemical kinetic model for 13 DMCH combustion is developed. Ignition measurements show that the <b>ignition</b> <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> of 13 DMCH are longer than those of its isomer, ethylcyclohexane. The proposed chemical kinetic model predicts reasonably well the effects of equivalence ratio and pressure, with overall good agreement between predicted and measured <b>ignition</b> <b>delay</b> <b>times,</b> except at low dilution levels and high pressures. Simulated fuel concentration profiles agree reasonably well with the measured profiles, and both highlight the influence of pyrolysis on the overall ignition kinetics at high temperatures. Sensitivity and reaction pathway analyses provide further insight into the kinetic processes controlling ignition and pyrolysis. The work contributes toward improved understanding and modeling of the oxidation and pyrolysis kinetics of cycloalkanes...|$|R
40|$|Hypergolic {{ignition}} by the {{head-on collision}} of a smaller N,N,N',N' tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) droplet {{and a larger}} white fuming nitric acid (WFNA) droplet was experimentally investigated by using a droplet collision experimental apparatus equipped with a time-resolved shadowgraph, a photodetector and an infrared detector. The investigation was focused on understanding the influence of droplet collision and mixing, which vary with the collisional Weber number (We = 20 - 220) and the droplet size ratio (Delta = 1. 2 - 2. 9) while have a fixed Ohnesorge number (Oh = 2. 5 x 10 (- 3)), on the hypergolic ignitability and the <b>ignition</b> <b>delay</b> <b>times.</b> The hypergolic <b>ignition</b> was found to critically rely on the heat release from of the liquid-phase reaction of TMEDA and nitric acid, which is subsequent to and enhanced by the effective mixing of the droplets of proper size ratios. Consequently, the ignitability regime nomogram in the We-A space shows that the hypergolic ignition favors small Delta s and large Wes; the <b>ignition</b> <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> tend to decrease with either decreasing Delta, or increasing We, or both. A non-monotonic variation of the <b>ignition</b> <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> with We was observed and attributed to the non-monotonic emergence of jet-like mixing patterns that enhance the droplet mixing and hence the liquid-phase reaction.

40|$|An {{autoignition}} {{test section}} and a premixing fuel injector developed {{to determine the}} autoignition characteristics {{of a variety of}} aircraft fuels are described. Parametric tests to map the <b>ignition</b> <b>delay</b> characteristics of Jet-A fuel were conducted at pressures of 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 atm, inlet air temperatures up to 900 K and fuel-air equivalence ratios of 0. 3, 0. 5, 0. 7, and 1. 0. Residence times in the range of 1 to 50 msec were obtained by interchanging spool pieces to create six different mixer/vaporizer lengths (6, 23, 53, 84, 99, and 130 cm) and by testing at two different airflow rates (0. 5 and 1. 0 kg/sec). The resulting free-stream velocities were in the range 20 to 100 m/sec. As expected, the results indicate that the <b>ignition</b> <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> decrease with increasing air temperature and pressure. Also, the data show that, for lean mixtures, <b>ignition</b> <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> decrease with increasing equivalence ratios...|$|R
