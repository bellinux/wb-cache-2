5|$|In China, {{rice and}} millet were domesticated by 8,000 BC, {{followed}} by mung, soy and azuki beans. In the Sahel region of Africa, local rice and sorghum were domesticated by 5,000 BC. <b>Kola</b> <b>nut</b> and coffee were domesticated in Africa. In New Guinea, ancient Papuan peoples began practicing agriculture around 7,000 BC, domesticating sugarcane and taro. In the Indus Valley from the eighth millennium BC onwards at Mehrgarh, 2-row and 6-row barley were cultivated, along with einkorn, emmer, and durum wheats, and dates. In the earliest levels of Merhgarh, wild game such as gazelle, swamp deer, blackbuck, chital, wild ass, wild goat, wild sheep, boar, and nilgai were all hunted for food. These are successively replaced by domesticated sheep, goats, and humped zebu cattle {{by the fifth}} millennium BC, indicating the gradual transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Kola</b> <b>nuts</b> are an {{important}} part of the traditional spiritual practice of culture and religion in West Africa, particularly Niger, Nigeria and Liberia. The 1970s hit [...] "Goro City", by Manu Dibango, highlights the significance of <b>kola</b> <b>nuts</b> (called [...] "goro" [...] in the Hausa language) to the capital of Niger, Niamey. <b>Kola</b> <b>nuts</b> are used as a religious object and sacred offering during prayers, ancestor veneration, and significant life events, such as naming ceremonies, weddings, and funerals. They are also used in a traditional divination system called Obi divination. For this use, only <b>kola</b> <b>nuts</b> divided into four lobes are suitable. They are cast upon a special wooden board and the resulting patterns are read by a trained diviner. This ancient practice is currently enjoying increased growth within the United States and Caribbean.|$|R

25|$|<b>Kola</b> <b>nut</b> (ọ́jị̀, or ọ́jị̀ Ìgbò) {{offerings and}} prayers (ị́gọ́ ọ́jị̀, 'kola nut blessing', ị́wá ọ́jị̀, 'kola nut breaking') can be {{performed}} personally between one and his spirit or in a group in a form of a prayer or chant. The saluter addresses their personal god or chi as well as alusi and their ancestors. These kola nuts are held in a special round bowl called ọ́kwá with a compartment at {{the centre of the}} bowl for condiments for the <b>kola</b> <b>nut</b> such as alligator pepper (or capsicum cayene, ósẹ̀ ọ́jị́) and ground peanuts. The bowl and <b>kola</b> <b>nut</b> rite is used to welcome visitors into a household. After the prayer, the ceremony ends with the saluter sharing pieces of the kola with the group, known as ị́ké ọ́jị̀. The kola is supposed to cut by hand, but more recently knives have become acceptable. When the cola has three cotyledons, or parts, it is considered an ọ́jị̀ ìkéǹgà in some northern communities (going by other names in communities Ikenga doesn't operate) and is considered a sign of great luck, bravery and nobility. O wetalu oji wetalu ndu — 'one who brings kola brings life' is a popular saying that points to the auspiciousness of the kola rite.|$|E

25|$|Chapman J. Root, {{president}} of the Root Glass Company of Terre Haute, Indiana, turned the project over to members of his supervisory staff, including company auditor T. Clyde Edwards, plant superintendent Alexander Samuelsson, and Earl R. Dean, bottle designer and supervisor of the bottle molding room. Root and his subordinates decided to base the bottle's design {{on one of the}} soda's two ingredients, the coca leaf or the <b>kola</b> <b>nut,</b> but were unaware of what either ingredient looked like. Dean and Edwards went to the Emeline Fairbanks Memorial Library and were unable to find any information about coca or kola. Instead, Dean was inspired by a picture of the gourd-shaped cocoa pod in the Encyclopædia Britannica. Dean made a rough sketch of the pod and returned to the plant to show Root. He explained to Root how he could transform the shape of the pod into a bottle. Root gave Dean his approval.|$|E

The aim of this work was to determine caffeine content from two varieties of <b>kola</b> <b>nuts</b> (Cola nitida) by using UV spectrophotometric method and {{examine the effect of}} extraction solvent and solid-liquid ratio for the optimal caffeine extraction from <b>kola</b> <b>nuts.</b> <b>Kola</b> <b>nuts</b> were collected in October 2013 to March 2014 in two regions of Cola nitida plantation in Cote d’Ivoire. Harvested <b>kola</b> <b>nuts</b> were transferred to the laboratory until used in the experiments.

After drying and powder processing, six solvents (Water, Ethanol 100 %, Methanol 100 %, methanol 50 % in water, ethanol 50 % in water and Water/Ethanol/Methanol (WEM) (2 / 1 / 1, v/v/v) and five solid/liquid (w/v) ratio (1 / 100, 3 / 100, 4 / 100, 5 / 100 and 6 / 100) were used for evaluate caffeine content and determine the effect of each parameter.
