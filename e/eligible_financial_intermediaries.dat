40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} crude oil price and <b>financial</b> sector <b>intermediary</b> development in Nigeria over the period 1975 - 2011, using the autoregressive distributed lag approach to cointegration analysis. Four measures of <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> development are used including an index of <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> development constructed from three indicators of <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> development using principal component analysis. The results show that crude oil price is a key driver of <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> development in Nigeria. A positive and significant long run relationship between <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> development and crude oil price coexists with a negative short run relationship. The results show that even if we control for economic growth, inflation and trade openness, crude oil price still has significant influence {{on the development of}} financial intermediation in Nigeria. The findings of this study have important policy implications for <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> development in Nigeria and other developing oil-exporting countries...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the direct and}} indirect effects of <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> development on output fluctuations based on the theoretical works by Bacchetta and Caminal (2000) and Beck, Lundberg and Majnoni (2006).

This paper examines whether <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> serve as shock absorbers or shock magnifiers that mitigate or amplify the effect of real and monetary shocks on output fluctuations. Using data from 8 countries of ASEAN- 5 Plus 3, the empirical results indicate that (1) there is strong and robust evidence for the dampening effect of <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> development on output fluctuations via the propagation of real shocks, (2) there is somewhat weak evidence for the magnifying effect of <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> development via the propagation of monetary shocks and (3) <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> development has strong direct impact on output fluctuations if countries are bankdependent in the cointegration regression.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{evaluates the}} {{empirical}} {{relationship between the}} level of <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> development and (i) economic growth, (ii) total factor productivity growth, (iii) physical capital accumulation, and (iv) private saving rates.

After controlling for these potential biases, we find that (1) <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> exert a large, positive impact on total factor productivity growth, which feeds through to overall GDP growth; and (2) the long-run links between <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> development and both physical capital growth and private saving rates are tenuous...|$|R
40|$|Although {{theoretical}} models make distinct {{predictions about the}} relation between finance and income inequality, little empirical {{research has been conducted}} to compare their relative explanatory power. We examine the relation between <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> development and income inequality in a panel data set of 91 countries for the period of 1960 - 95. Our results provide reasonably strong evidence that inequality decreases as economies develop their <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries,</b> consistent with Galor and Zeira (1993) and Banerjee and Newman (1993). Moreover, consistent with the insight of Kuznets, the relation between the Gini coefficient and <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> development depends on the sectoral structure of the economy: a larger modern sector is associated with a smaller drop in the Gini coefficient for the same level of <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> development. However, {{there is no evidence of}} an inverted-U shaped relation between financial sector development and income inequality, as suggested by Greenwood and Jovanovic (1990). The results are robust to controlling for biases introduced by simultaneity. Income inequality, <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> development, Kuznets curve...|$|R

We document evidence that balance sheets of <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> provide a window on the transmission of monetary policy through capital market conditions.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} nature of {{monetary}} policy in a cash-in-advance model with indivisible labor and with <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> that provide loans for working capital.

This model helps explain why monetary policy based on growth in monetary aggregates can have ambiguous output effects, why central bankers usually prefer interest rate rules to monetary aggregate rules, and why estimated money demand equations tend to be unstable. ...|$|R
