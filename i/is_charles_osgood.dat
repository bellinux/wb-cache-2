40|$|Image of Pärnu {{among the}} school-leavers of Pärnu Sütevaka Grammar School and Pärnu Ülejõe Gymnasium. Main purpose of bachelor’s thesis was to {{research}} and analyze image dimensions of Pärnu among school-leavers of two different Pärnu’s schools. Author is also comparing results with Aune Past’s master’s thesis’ results from 1999. Bachelor’s thesis consists of four chapters. The first one gives an overview of different theoretical discourses that explain {{the concept of the}} image. It also explains formation of image and different methods of researching it. Second chapter explains research methods, research questions and hypothesis. Pärnu’s background as object of research is also included. Third chapter is dedicated to results and analyzes of the research. And last chapter is conclusion of the paper. Research questions were: do the dimensions of image differ among two different school students. How could the image of Pärnu be better. Is the image of Pärnu depending on wellbeing of local people. Hypothesis were: Pärnu’s public image is positive. The image is different in Pärnu Ülejõe Gymnasium and Pärnu Sütevaka Grammar School. Pärnu Sütevaka Grammar School’s students are more critical about the society. As quantitative research method <b>was</b> used <b>Charles</b> <b>Osgood’s</b> semantic differentiation with questionnaire. Semi-structure interviews with entrants of both schools were used as qualitative method. Semantic differentiation revealed that Pärnu is perceived as “own”, “warm” and “developing”. And gender, school and educational success was not decisive. Interviews proved the results of semantic differentiation, but students also brought out facts that have negative impact on Pärnu’s image. Most often was mentioned the meer of Pärnu. Also became clear that the image of Pärnu depends on wellbeing of local people as they might be also “the important other” who form the public image of Pärnu...|$|R
