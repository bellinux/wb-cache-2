5|$|Metro began {{testing a}} fleet of new hybrid {{diesel-electric}} buses in 2002, intending to use them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> tunnel {{before and after the}} conversion to joint bus-rail operations. The first few of a planned fleet of 235 hybrid diesel-electric articulated buses began operating on tunnel bus routes in June 2004. The Breda dual-mode trolleybuses were removed from the tunnel in January 2005 and would later be refurbished into electric-only trolleybuses for use on the city's trolleybus network. The last day of trolleybus operation in the tunnel was January 24, 2005, with only a single dual-mode bus in service on the final day.|$|E
5|$|On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks {{was arrested}} for refusing {{to give up her}} seat on a city bus. The Montgomery bus boycott, urged and planned by Nixon and led by King, soon followed. The boycott lasted for 385 days, and the {{situation}} became so tense that King's house was bombed. King was arrested during this campaign, which concluded with a United States District Court ruling in Browder v. Gayle that ended racial segregation on all Montgomery public buses. King's role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> boycott transformed him into a national figure and the best-known spokesman of the civil rights movement.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{differences}} <b>in</b> {{physiological and}} safety conditions of one-man buses and two-man buses were examined from the view point of occupational fatigue. This survey {{consisted of a}} work load study which included a time study, study of subsidiary behavior, auditory task, memory test, Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) and physiological function tests and a self-administered questionnaire which involved items concerning safety and subjective fatigue complaints. The visual and postural restrictions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> one-man <b>bus</b> were greater than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two-man <b>bus.</b> <b>The</b> mental capacity of <b>the</b> one-man <b>bus</b> drivers {{was found to be}} less. Greater mental fatigue and stress were observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> one-man <b>bus.</b> More subjective fatigue complaints were observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> one-man <b>bus.</b> More cases of near accidents were observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> one-man <b>bus.</b> From these results it was concluded that <b>the</b> one-man <b>bus</b> caused bus drivers a greater mental and physical work load. </p...|$|R

5|$|Regular service <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> tunnel {{began on}} September 15, 1990, on five routes serving the University District, North Seattle, and Renton. The limited service {{was the result}} of delays in the {{manufacturing}} of dual-mode buses from Breda, which were fully delivered in 1991. The opening was preceded by soft openings of each individual station, beginning with Westlake station in August 1989, and ending with Convention Place station the day before the beginning of service. A ceremonial walk and run was held on September 9, 1990, and attracted 5,000 participants.|$|E
