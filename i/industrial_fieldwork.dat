The theory covers both animate and. inanimate fieldwork systems and is based upon the idea of behaviour programmable physical. action units and modules. The paper gives examples. of the theory's use to model dynamic systems composed of individual systems and fleets of, disparateform, active agents. Some emerging applications of mixed fleet robot systems in construction, agriculture, forestry and mining are presented. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{highlights}} the importance of organizational and cultural contexts in the efficiency of knowledge sharing strategies and particularly strategies based on the use of Information Systems to support knowledge sharing activities. Relying not only on our theoretical investigations, but also on <b>industrial</b> <b>fieldworks,</b> we propose a framework which helps Identify, given dominant characteristics of the organizational and cultural contexts, information system functionalities to develop or to promote in order to support knowledge sharing. A case study illustrates the use of our framework and the implications of this work are finally discussed {{at the end of this}} paper...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the example}} of the Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) Curriculum that exists as a {{scientific}} direction in the undergraduate programme of the Chemical Engineering School, in the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), in Greece, is presented. The course content includes several tools, such as theoretical lessons, laboratory modules - non-destructive testing (NDT) and instrumental techniques - semi <b>industrial</b> scale devices, <b>fieldworks</b> and a dissertation thesis. The presented curriculum can be regarded as an innovative educational model for chemical engineering students that choose to become involved in the field of MSE. © 2003 Materials Research Society...|$|R

Having completed her degree, she worked at the Chiltern Open Air Museum, the Royal Armouries and the British Engineerium where she continues to be employed. It was from here that her television career was launched when she appeared on Channel 4's Salvage Squad - a programme about restoring historical machinery - first as a participant, later as co-presenter. Whilst filming, she completed a master's degree in Conservation of Industrial Heritage and won the Association for <b>Industrial</b> Archaeology Student <b>Fieldwork</b> Award.|$|R
40|$|This article reconstructs how workers {{perceived}} asbestos hazards, using narratives from a {{group of}} migrant workers at the crocidolite mine of Wittenoom Gorge, Western Australia. The mine employed about 7000 workers over the entire period of its operation from 1943 to 1966 [...] relying heavily on migrant workers. The exposure to asbestos dust caused a huge number of occupational respiratory diseases in workers, leading Wittenoom later to be labelled as a modern <b>industrial</b> disaster. <b>Fieldwork</b> involved 137 interviews with Italians who had worked at Wittenoom. They constituted 18 % of the mine's work-force and were employed as miners or millers between 1951 and 1966. We interviewed workers who had returned to Italy, relatives of Italian workers now deceased, and workers who had settled in Australia. The results confirm the seriousness of the occupational exposure to asbestos and the weaknesses of the health surveillance program. Although workers were given no health-related information, they felt they were at risk and left the job as soon as possible. From the early 1950 s onward, some of the workers became aware of a long-term connection between work at Wittenoom and lung illnesses that required hospitalisation and caused deaths. However, up to the early 1960 s, workers at the mine were led to believe that the respiratory disease spreading among them was tuberculosis.

40|$|Between 1977 and 2011 the Swedish {{organization}} Samdok {{presented a}} nationwide programme for contemporary museum collecting, including an increasingly flexible intellectual and methodological framework. This article considers Samdok, its evolving programmes and self-presentations. It suggests that Samdok. s selfimage {{was one of}} inclusive progressiveness, social engagement and equality. It also suggests that they display four major rhetorical shifts: from an economic rationale to a social and cultural approach; from studies of a welfare state based´on <b>industrial</b> production to <b>fieldwork</b> concerning the adaptation to a postindustrial economy; from modern to post-modern epistemologies; and finally from engineering collecting to networking collecting, connecting contemporary collecting in Sweden to a transnational professional community. It is suggested that the case of Samdok casts light on {{the ways in which}} museums negotiate managerial issues, professional values and needs for inspiration and friendship. Eunamus.

40|$|In {{northern}} Peru, a 500 km long regional balanced section {{has been}} constructed across the eastern Andean wedge, using <b>fieldwork,</b> <b>industrial</b> seismic sections, and wells. The structure {{is characterized by}} a thin-skinned thrust system involving the Eastern Cordillera (EC), the sub-Andean zone (SAZ), and the Maranon foredeep. In the SAZ and the easternmost foredeep the development of the thrust system has been driven by the combination of two structural events. Permian thrust faults had been reactivated to form a basement duplex underlying the SAZ and the foredeep. At the same time a Triassic-Jurassic extensional basin has been transported as a crustal ramp anticline on to the duplex roof fault, giving rise to the EC. The impingement of the EC was responsible for the deformation of the SAZ and the propagation of the thrust wedge. The minimum shortening calculated is 142 km, representing a shortening strain of similar to- 28 %. A sequential restoration calibrated by (U-Th) /He and Fission Track dating on apatites and vitrinite reflectance values shows that shortening rates vary from 7. 1 mmyr(- 1) between 17 and 8 Ma to 3. 6 mmyr(- 1) between 8 Ma and today and suggests that the thrust wedge commenced propagation between 30 and 24 Ma. When compared with other Andean thrust wedges, we suggest that the timing of the thrust wedge propagation is not a simple function of the distance to the hinge of the Bolivian orocline and the propagation is not controlled by the precipitation regime. We rather suggest that reactivated basement faults favored thrust wedge propagation...|$|R
