50|$|Guests, some {{in formal}} evening wear, arrived {{to find the}} {{driveway}} blocked by a trench; investigating on foot, they found a banquet table with a ten-day-old turkey feast being drenched by a <b>garden</b> <b>sprinkler</b> as dinner music and farm animal sounds played over speakers. With Graves and his cohorts refusing to answer the door, guests, amused and otherwise, responded by storming off, sketching the scene, or filching silverware from the table.|$|E
50|$|In physics, {{intensity}} {{is the power}} transferred per unit area, where the area is measured on the plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the energy. In the SI system, it has units watts per square metre (W/m2). It is used most frequently with waves (e.g. sound or light), {{in which case the}} average power transfer over one period of the wave is used. Intensity can be applied to other circumstances where energy is transferred. For example, one could calculate the intensity of the kinetic energy carried by drops of water from a <b>garden</b> <b>sprinkler.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although {{telegraph}} came to Hamilton {{with the}} 1864 invasion which established the town, {{it was quite}} late in developing its gas (1895), water (1903), sewage (1907) and electricity supplies (1913), probably because its population remained low; in 1911 Hamilton's population was 3,542 and Frankton's 1,113. Optical cables and microwave towers now provide telecommunications links, gas is supplied by pipeline from Taranaki, water from the Waikato River by the Water Treatment Station at Waiora Terrace, sewage flows for treatment at Pukete and electricity comes from the national grid. Restrictions are still placed on <b>garden</b> <b>sprinklers</b> in summer and the Pukete sewage works was still not always meeting discharge Resource consent conditions in 2013.|$|R
50|$|Layne {{hears the}} creepy tune and, {{carrying}} a small cooler, walks {{outside for a}} showdown. His children, lured by Buster from the car a short distance away, run to them. Buster's vengeful spirit offers an ice-cream (shaped like Layne) to Layne's kids. Layne and Buster struggle until Layne turns on the <b>garden</b> <b>sprinklers,</b> freezing the clown. Layne's son sees the ice-cream treat Layne had dropped, and it's shaped exactly like Buster. The kid bites it and the clown dies. In the next scene, everything appears normal again and the family is about {{to move away from}} that town, but suddenly Layne hears the old creepy tune again and the film ends with a flash of Buster's rotten face.|$|R
5000|$|The metal used in {{die-casting}} {{is either}} a lead alloy (used early on), or more commonly, Zamak (called Mazak in the UK), an alloy of zinc with small quantities of aluminium and copper. Lead or iron are impurities that must be carefully avoided in Zamac, as they {{give rise to a}} deterioration of the metal most commonly called zinc pest. The terms white metal or pot metal are also used when applied to alloys based more on lead or iron. The most common die-cast vehicles are scale models of automobiles, aircraft, military vehicles, construction equipment, and trains, although almost anything can be produced by this method, like Monopoly game pieces, furniture handles, or metal <b>garden</b> <b>sprinklers.</b>|$|R
40|$|Most {{exercises}} for teaching students Response Surface Methodology deal with {{setting up the}} experiment itself or analyzing the data after the fact. As such, the experience of “learning-by-doing” and drawing intermediate conclusions is lost. For this reason a web-based application was developed, based on a real-life problem dealing with the multi-objective optimization of a <b>garden</b> <b>sprinkler</b> having 8 design parameters and 3 responses. Participants interact with the tool to get the response data for their own designs. Depending on {{the choice of the}} considered response(s), different design parameters are active and should be analyzed. By inserting a design into the application, the corresponding responses are generated and can be used for analysis and follow- up experimentation. The tool has been successfully used both in company training and academic courses. status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|A {{spectral}} wave model coupling a quadtree-adaptive discretisation {{of the two}} spatial dimensions with {{a standard}} discretisation of the two spectral dimensions is described. The implementation is greatly simplified by reusing components of the Gerris solver (for spatial advection on quadtrees) and WAVEWATCH III (for spectral advection and source terms). Strict equivalence between the anisotropic diffusion and spatial filtering methods for alleviation of the <b>Garden</b> <b>Sprinkler</b> Effect (GSE) is demonstrated. This equivalence facilitates the generalisation of GSE alleviation techniques to quadtree grids. For {{the case of a}} cyclone-generated wave field, the cost of the adaptive method increases linearly with spatial resolution compared to quadratically for constant-resolution methods. This leads to decreases in runtimes of one to two orders of magnitude for practical spatial resolutions. Similar efficiency gains are shown to be possible for global spectral wave forecasting...|$|E

25|$|Climate {{change could}} have {{significant}} impacts on water resources {{around the world}} because of the close connections between the climate and hydrological cycle. Rising temperatures will increase evaporation and lead to increases in precipitation, though there will be regional variations in rainfall. Both droughts and floods may become more frequent in different regions at different times, and dramatic changes in snowfall and snow melt are expected in mountainous areas. Higher temperatures will also affect water quality {{in ways that are}} not well understood. Possible impacts include increased eutrophication. Climate change could also mean an increase in demand for farm irrigation, <b>garden</b> <b>sprinklers,</b> and perhaps even swimming pools. There is now ample evidence that increased hydrologic variability and change in climate has and will continue have a profound impact on the water sector through the hydrologic cycle, water availability, water demand, and water allocation at the global, regional, basin, and local levels.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Some {{topics in}} the theory of jets are reviewed. These include jet precession, {{unconfined}} jets, the origin of knots, the internal shock model as a unifying theme from protostellar jets to Gamma-ray bursts, relations between the Blandford-Znajek and MHD disk-wind models, and jet collimation in magnetic acceleration models. 1. Jet precession and warped disks Precession is measured directly in the jets of SS 433, whose direction varies with an approximate 165 d period. Indirect evidence is seen in the morphology of the hot spots of AGN jets. An example is as Cyg A, where the radio lobes show ‘fossil ’ hot spots, offset from the present (most luminous) hot spot position by rotation over angles of some 10 degrees. This gives an approximate point symmetric appearance to the lobes of. If the central engine causes the direction of the jet to change with time (precession), its path in space at a given time appears curved, like the spray of water from a rotating <b>garden</b> <b>sprinkler.</b> At each point along the instantaneou...|$|E
40|$|Various studies {{conducted}} {{to process the}} vast solar energy is abundant in the world, especially in Indonesia, which is a tropical country. Now this {{is the use of}} solar panels was developed as an alternative source of electrical energy generation. Researchers {{are looking for ways to}} utilize solar panels as a tool that can ease and useful for society as garden sprinklers work automatically by considering the soil moisture. This research aims to design an automatic garden sprinklers solar power refers to soil moisture. In the automatic <b>garden</b> <b>sprinkler</b> methods of solar power does is to design a place to put solar panels at a height of 2 meters above the ground at an angle of 300, the installation of sprinklers in the area of the plant so that the plant can pour water thoroughly, and installation of soil moisture sensor in the ground at a distance of 1 meter in hopes sensor can work in accordance with the value of soil moisture. How to observations made related to data capture voltage and current generated by solar panels, water discharge, variations in water bursts and the length of time to supply water pumps. The equipment used for these measurements, among others: luxmeter, used to measure the intensity of light. Ammeters, used to measure DC current. Multitester, used for measuring voltage and AC current. Stopwatch, used to calculate long time. The results showed that, the aquarium water pump can be switched on and off automatically without human intermediaries, it is because the soil moisture sensor, if the sensor shows values above 700 then the Arduino Uno will be channeled towards the output power relay circuit that turns on the water pump. Conversely, if the humidity sensor indicates a value less than 700 then the Arduino Uno does not provide power to the relay output so that the source DC circuit the battery can not be transmitted to the water pump. Testing the water pump without the use of solar panels capable of changing the water pump tank for 25 minutes. This is because it is full of energy supplied by the battery (batteries). Meanwhile, when the use of solar panels for the highest intensity obtained when this study is 102, 000 lux, able to turn the water pump tank for 55 minutes. Aquarium water pump can operate longer with a distance of 30 minutes compared to using solar panels...|$|E

50|$|In 1999, {{a tribute}} {{commercial}} to the Flake Girls of decades past was released, {{much to the}} delight of nostalgic fans. The montage began with a clip of the very first Flake Girl commercial from 1959, followed by a 1965 clip of a girl relaxing in a rowing boat whilst being pestered by a cheeky swan for a peck of her Flake bar. The next clip showed the 1973 ad of a doe-eyed artist in a field of poppies painting a watercolour and indulging in a Flake bar, before being caught in a summer shower. This was followed by a clip of the exotic 1987 ad in which a restless woman in silk negligee reposes on a window sill on a sultry night, indulging in a Flake bar whilst a gecko lizard is noted crawling over a ringing telephone. Next was a clip of the classical 1991 Flake ad in which a woman sporting a dark, cropped hairstyle (resembling Demi Moore and Enya's hair at the time) reposes in an overflowing bath tub in a great painted hall. Lastly, this tribute montage commercial ended with the latest Flake Girl ad (1999), featuring a Parisienne relaxing in a summery garden overlooking the Eiffel Tower. As she bites into the Flake bar in her ice-cream, the <b>garden</b> <b>sprinklers</b> are set off and she is drenched in refreshing water.|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of fungicides in controlling white mold (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum) of dry beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) was evaluated {{when they were}} applied through irrigation water directly onto the plants or only to the soil. Two field trials were installed in April 1998 and April 1999 in Viçosa, MG. Trials were conducted as a (2 x 3) + 1 factorial: two fungicides x three application modes + one untreated control. The fungicides were benomyl (1. 0 kg a. i. ha- 1) and fluazinam (0. 5 l a. i. ha- 1). The three application modes were: (a) by backpack sprayer (667 l ha- 1), (b) by <b>garden</b> watering-cans simulating <b>sprinkler</b> irrigation with 35, 000 l ha- 1 of water, and (c) by garden watering-cans applying water between the rows and near the soil surface in 35, 000 l ha- 1 of water. In 1998, fungicides were applied at 43 and 54 days after emergence (DAE); in 1999, at 47 and 61 DAE. Both fungicides were similarly effective on white mold control when applied by either chemigation or backpack sprayer, resulting in yields 21 % higher than untreated control. Only fluazinam provided disease control when applications were made only in soil. Chemigation provided white mold control equivalent to that of backpack sprayer in terms of incidence, severity and number of diseased pods. Consequently, yield differences between these application methods were not significant...|$|R
