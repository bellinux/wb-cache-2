40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 47 - 49) It was expected, in general, {{that users}} who could view help text simultaneously with task text would outperform {{those who could}} not. Four methods for presenting help were compared: WINDOW (a five line help display was presented simultaneously with the display of task text), DUAL (two lines of help were presented simultaneous with the task on the first help request, and a full screen overlayed the task on the next request), FULL (a full screen of help overlayed the task), and MANUAL (help was available off-line in a book). Two types of tasks were assigned to users <b>in</b> each <b>help</b> condition: SIMPLE (all necessary information to complete the tasks was given) and COMPLEX (users were forced to find and remember information pertinent to task completion). Typical computer tasks, such as file and job management were performed. Measures were taken for each set of simple or complex tasks. Dependent measures were 1) the average time to complete each task, 2) the number of steps taken beyond the optimal number for the set, 3) the average time spent <b>in</b> <b>help</b> per task, 4) the average time spent <b>in</b> <b>help</b> per request, 5) {{the average number of}} times help was accessed per task, and 6) the average total time to complete each task, including help time. The FULL help group spent significantly less time <b>in</b> <b>help</b> per task, and along with the DUAL help group, less time <b>in</b> <b>help</b> per request than did the other groups. However, FULL help users spent significantly longer <b>in</b> <b>help</b> per task than DUAL help users spent on the full screen of help presented to them per task...|$|R
