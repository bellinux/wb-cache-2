40|$|Laboratory column {{experiments}} plus {{analytical and}} numerical modeling together suggest that, under certain conditions, downward <b>organic</b> <b>liquid</b> mobilization can occur and impact smoldering behavior. This applies <b>for</b> <b>organic</b> <b>liquids</b> mixed with inert sand subjected to smoldering as thermal treatment. The observed effects include increased peak temperatures (here {{by up to}} 35 %) and increased treatment times (here by up to 30 %). Downward <b>organic</b> <b>liquid</b> migration occurs when (i) injected Darcy air flux {{is less than a}} threshold value (here less than 3 cm/s), (ii) treatment systems are tall (here 90 cm, not 30 cm), and (iii) the <b>organic</b> <b>liquid</b> is temperature-sensitive (viscosity less than 0. 01 Pa s at 150 °C).

The dried cryogels, with interconnected macropores were sponge-like soft materials, with excellent buoyancy and hydrophobicity. They also showed excellent sorption characteristics, with the best sample exhibiting maximum sorption capacities of 17. 8 g g− 1 for crude oil, 21. 6 g g− 1 for diesel oil, and 23. 4 g g− 1 for lubricating oil, respectively.

Denmark and Austria {{are among the}} most developed organic food markets in the world. Using the Diamond Model of factors contributing to competitiveness, detailed case studies of these countries were undertaken to identify the drivers in the growth of consumption of organic food and milk products. Market share <b>for</b> <b>organic</b> <b>liquid</b> milk in Ireland is less than 0. 1 % compared with 20 % in Denmark and 9 % in Austria. All the factors of the Diamond Model worked to grow the organic food market in Denmark and Austria. The Austrian and Danish Governments were the first in Europe to introduce legislation on organic farming and also subsidised farmers to bridge conversion to organic farming. The conventional milk sector in Ireland is very competitive but has not shown an interest in organics, whereas in Denmark the largest conventional milk processor is the main player. The small size of the Irish organic milk market means it is not a major area of rivalry at retail level. This contrasts with Denmark and Austria where retailers have driven the market. In Denmark, following approaches in 1993 from farmers’ representatives, the major retail group, FDB, lowered organic milk prices to entice consumers to switch from conventional milk. The main Danish milk processor successfully launched the ‘Harmonie’ organic brand and moved the market from niche to mainstream. In Austria, Billa, a major retailer, set market targets and introduced a high quality organic own-label brand.

The position-specific isotope pattern created by liquid-vapor IEs is manifest in five liquids, which have an air-side limitation for volatilization.

40|$|The {{onset of}} {{cavitation}} is strongly {{enhanced by the}} presence of rough surfaces or impurities in the liquid. Despite decades of research, the way the geometry of these defects promote the nucleation of bubbles and its effect on the kinetics of the process remains largely unclear. We present here a comprehensive explanation of the catalytic action that roughness elements exert on the nucleation process for both pure vapor cavities and gas ones. This approach highlights that nucleation may follow nontrivial paths connected with a sharp decrease of the free energy barriers as compared to flat surfaces. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of intermediate metastable states that break the nucleation process in multiple steps; these states correspond to what is commonly known as cavitation nuclei. A single dimensionless parameter, the nucleation number, is found to control this rich phenomenology. The devised theory allows one to quantify the effect of the geometry and hydrophobicity of surface asperities on nucleation. Within the same framework, it is possible to treat both vapor cavitation, which is relevant, e. g., <b>for</b> <b>organic</b> <b>liquids,</b> and gas-promoted cavitation, which is commonly encountered in water.

Prior to positron annihilation, an electron-positron pair may form an orthopositronium (o-Ps) state, with a mean life of a few ns. Even if the o-Ps decay is speeded up by spin flip or pick off effects, it may introduce distortions in the photon emission time distribution, crucial for position reconstruction and pulse shape discrimination algorithms in anti-neutrino experiments.
