40|$|The {{present study}} {{focuses on the}} {{interaction}} of H 2 Rydberg molecules with doped silicon semiconductor surfaces. Para-H 2 Rydberg states with principal quantum numbers n = 17 - 21 and core rotational quantum number N(+) = 2 are populated via resonant two-colour two-photon (vacuum ultraviolet-ultraviolet) excitation and collide at grazing incidence with a surface. For small Rydberg-surface separation, the Rydberg states are ionized due to the attractive surface potential experienced by the Rydberg electron and the remaining ion-core is detectable by applying a sufficiently strong external electric field. It is found that the surface <b>ionization</b> <b>profiles</b> (ion signal vs applied field) of H 2 on p-type doped Si surfaces show a higher detected ion signal than for n-type Si surfaces, while an Au surface shows lower detected ion signal than either type of Si surface. It is shown that ion detectability decreases with increasing dopant density for both types of Si surfaces. Higher-n Rydberg states show higher ion detectability than lower-n Rydberg states but this variation becomes smaller when increasing the dopant density for both p- and n-type surfaces. Theoretical trajectory simulations were developed with a 2 D surface potential model and using the over-the-barrier model for the ionization distance; the results help to explain the observed variations of the experimental surface <b>ionization</b> <b>profiles</b> with dopant density and type...|$|R

40|$|Context: Since a few years, {{signatures}} of supernova remnants associated with molecular clouds {{have been detected}} in gamma rays. Whether these gamma rays are generated by cosmic ray electrons or by cosmic ray protons is usually not known. The detection of hadronic ionization signatures in spatial coincidence with gamma ray signatures can help to unambiguously identify supernova remnants as sources of cosmic ray protons. Methods: In order to calculate hadronic signatures from cosmic ray-induced ionization for {{an examination of the}} origin of the observed gamma rays, the transport equation for cosmic ray protons propagating in a molecular cloud, including the relevant momentum loss processes, is solved analytically and the proton flux at any position in the cloud is determined. Results: Since the solution of the transport equation is obtained for arbitrary source functions, it can be used for a variety of supernova remnants. The corresponding theoretical ionization rate, {{as a function of the}} penetration depth, is derived and compared to photoinduced <b>ionization</b> <b>profiles</b> in a case study with four supernova remnants associated with molecular clouds. Three of the remnants show a clear dominance of the hadronically induced ionization rate, while for one remnant, X-ray emission seems to dominate by a factor of 10. Conclusions: This is the first derivation of position-dependent profiles for cosmic ray-induced ionization with an analytic solution for arbitrary cosmic ray source spectra. The cosmic ray-induced ionization has to be compared to X-ray ionization for strong X-ray sources. For sources dominated by cosmic ray-induced ionization (e. g., W 49 B), the <b>ionization</b> <b>profiles</b> can be used in the future to map the spatial structure of hadronic gamma rays and rotation-vibrational lines induced by cosmic ray protons, helping to identify sources of hadronic cosmic rays.

40|$|The work of {{this thesis}} focuses on the {{interaction}} of high Rydberg states of hydrogen molecules and atoms with various doped Si semiconductor surfaces with the results compared with those obtained with an atomically flat gold surface. The {{major part of the}} thesis was carried out using para-H₂ molecular Rydberg states with principal quantum number n = 17 - 21 and core rotational quantum number N⁺ = 2. Subsequently, this study was continued using H atomic Rydberg states with principal quantum number n = 29 - 34. The high Rydberg states have been produced using two-step laser excitation. For close Rydberg surface separation (< 6 n² a. u.), the Rydberg states may be ionized due to an attractive surface potential experienced by the Rydberg electron, and the remaining ion core may be detected by applying an external electric field. An efficient ion detectability method is introduced to compare the many surface <b>ionization</b> <b>profiles</b> quantitatively. The p-type doped Si surfaces enhance the detected ion-signal more than the n-type doped Si surfaces due to the presence of widely distributed positive dopant charge fields in the p-type doped Si surfaces. As the dopant density increases, the area sampled by the resultant ions becomes effectively more neutral, and the decay rate of the potential from the surface dopant charge with distance from the surface becomes more rapid. Therefore, the minimum ionization distance is also reduced with increasing dopant density. It is found that the detected ion-signal decreases with increasing dopant density of both p- and n- type doped Si surfaces. The higher-n Rydberg states have shown higher ion detectability than that of lower-n Rydberg states and this variation also becomes smaller when increasing the dopant density. Experiments involving H 2 Rydberg molecules incident on various doped Si surfaces {{in the presence of a}} Stark field at the point of excitation are also presented here. The surface <b>ionization</b> <b>profiles</b> produced via both electron and ion detection schemes are measured by changing the Stark polarization. Positive surface dopant charges oppose production of backscattered electrons and negative surface dopant charges enhance the electron-signal. For the electron detection scheme, lightly doped n-type Si surfaces show higher detectability but in the case of p-type Si surfaces the more heavily doped Si surfaces give a higher detected signal. This different behaviour of the detected ion or electron signal implies a different production mechanism. Theoretical trajectory simulations were also carried out based on a new 2 D surface potential model. The results qualitatively agree with the experimental results and explain the changes of the surface <b>ionization</b> <b>profiles</b> between the various dopant types and dopant densities of the Si surfaces.

40|$|Abstract. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass {{spectrometry}} (MALDI-MS) experiments require a suitable match {{of the matrix}} and target compounds to achieve a selective and sensitive analysis. However, it is still difficult to predict which metabolites are ionizable with a given matrix and which factors lead to an efficient ionization. In the present study, we extracted structural properties of metabolites that contribute to their ionization in MALDI-MS analyses exploiting our experimental data set. The MALDI-MS experiment was performed for 200 standard metabolites using 9 -aminoacridine (9 -AA) as the matrix.
