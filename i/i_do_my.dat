25|$|Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman (recurring season 2, main cast season 3–5)– {{a crooked}} strip mall lawyer who {{represents}} Walt and Jesse. Odenkirk drew inspiration for Goodman from film producer Robert Evans. I thought about Robert Evans because I've listened to The Kid Stays in the Picture on CD. He's constantly switching up his cadence and his delivery. He emphasizes interesting words. He has loads of attitude {{in almost every}} line that he says. So when I rehearse the scenes alone <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> impersonation of Robert Evans to find those moments and turns. Then I go out and I do Saul.|$|E
25|$|In {{the whole}} of the ten years I have been working on radio and television, I have been working to a {{majority}} of women. I think women prefer men to be well-mannered, so I always try to watch my manners. They like men to be well dressed, so <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> best to observe this. Others bring to my notice the fact that I sometimes make grammatical errors in my speech; so, because of this, I try to watch my grammar – {{but at the same time}} I bear in mind that it's more profitable for me to be entertaining than to be perfect in my use of English.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Sanz {{recorded}} MTV Unplugged at the Gusman Center for the Performing Arts in Miami, Florida. He was {{the first}} Spanish artist to record and release an MTV Unplugged album. For Sanz, the recording of the album [...] "changed the way <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> music. It was a rediscovery of how to perform, and also how to record, music with live musicians. That was {{the spirit of the}} music in its pure form, though [...] that the more people who are playing, the more simple it is." [...] With the MTV Unplugged, he garnered three Latin Grammy Awards (Album of the Year, Recording of the Year and Song of the Year for [...] "Y Sólo Se Me Ocurre Amarte").|$|E

500|$|As Planet Terror took shape, Tarantino {{developed}} {{the story for}} Death Proof, based on his fascination for the way stuntmen would [...] "death-proof" [...] their cars. As {{long as they were}} driving, stuntmen could slam their cars headfirst into a brick wall at 60mph (97km/h) and survive. This inspired Tarantino to create a slasher film featuring a deranged stuntman who stalks and murders sexy young women with his [...] "death-proof" [...] car. Tarantino remembers, [...] "I realized I couldn't do a straight slasher film, because with the exception of women-in-prison films, there is no other genre quite as rigid. And if you break that up, you aren't really doing it anymore. It's inorganic, so I realized—let me take the structure of a slasher film and just do what <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> <b>My</b> version is going to be fucked up and disjointed, but it seemingly uses the structure of a slasher film, hopefully against you." ...|$|E
500|$|Manning {{said his}} ninth-place result in his début race was one they felt was a [...] "fantastic result". He thanked his crew, their sponsor, and the track's management. However, he was {{disappointed}} that {{he was unable to}} get practice runs before the qualifying session as he felt that he could have started in a higher position. Bräck stated that he lost the chance of victory when a crew member dropped a wheel nut on his final pit stop, saying: [...] "There is something hanging over us. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> part, they do their part. When everyone is having a good day you win. If not, you lose." [...] Fernández was angry with the pit lane speeding penalty, saying he felt he could have achieved a better finishing position and that the rule on pit lane speeding could [...] "ruin your day". After the race, he spent several hours discussing the penalty with race officials. John Lopes, the CART Vice President of Racing Operations, later stated that the series would investigate the rules regarding pit lane speeding penalties but affirmed that no action could be taken until after the season's end.|$|E
500|$|Writing that {{he belongs}} to the Intersex Society of America, Cal notes {{that he has not}} participated in any of the group's rallies because he is not a [...] "political person". While {{discussing}} political activism, Cal uses the word [...] "intersex", though {{in other parts of the}} novel, he uses the word [...] "hermaphrodite". In the 1920s, Bernice L. Hausman described [...] "intersexuality" [...] as a [...] "continuum of physiological and anatomical sex differences", contesting the notion of a [...] "true sex" [...] concealed in the tissues of the body. Though [...] "hermaphrodite" [...] is burdened by the implications of the anomaly, [...] "intersexuality" [...] is a neologism that tries to [...] "naturalize various sexes, which themselves are naturally occurring." [...] Because Cal uses [...] "hermaphrodite", he indicates that the sole normal genders are the classifications of male and female. Eugenides was asked by an Oprah's Book Club member why he used the term [...] "hermaphrodite" [...] despite its usage being [...] "either terribly ignorant or unforgivably callous". Eugenides replied that he reserved [...] "hermaphrodite" [...] for a literary character: Hermaphroditus. He further stated: [...] "When speaking about real people, I should—and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> best to—use the term 'intersex'." [...] Noting that one of the initial sources he consulted was the journal Hermaphrodites with Attitude published by the Intersex Society of North America, he said that those writers have [...] "co-opted" [...] the term [...] "hermaphrodite". Their action is reminiscent, Eugenides wrote, of how some members of the gay community have [...] "reclaimed" [...] the term [...] "queer". Eugenides stated that it is no surprise that Cal uses [...] "hermaphrodite" [...] and further elaborated: [...] "It's paradoxical: Cal can say 'hermaphodite' but I can't. Or shouldn't." ...|$|E

After wishing him [...] "Happy birthday, Mr. President", she reportedly claimed knowledge about Kadyrov saying, [...] "I read. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> research." [...] Following criticism from human rights groups, that reported having informed her about the human rights abuses in Chechnya prior to the event {{and asked her to}} reconsider her participation, Swank said she was unaware that Kadyrov had been accused of human rights violations and that she [...] "deeply regrets" [...] taking part in the lavish concert. She donated her personal appearance fees [...] "to various charitable organizations".|$|E
2500|$|Leslie then {{produced}} {{her entire}} album, {{which is a}} mix of pop and R Cassie described her sound as [...] "mellow, chill, and easy to relate to.

[...] It has some funk, some old stuff, it's really fun." [...] She paid tribute to her Filipino culture by incorporating OPM sounds into some of the ballads. While describing the process of working with Leslie, she stated, [...] "I will talk about situations that I was going through at the time and we'll talk about that and it comes straight from the heart that's why it works out well between us," [...] continuing about her songwriting input, [...] "I was just kind of going along with it trying to get the vibe. I'm starting to get into it and I'm excited to write." [...] Cassie also mentioned [...] "Not With You" [...] was one of her favorite songs, [...] "It's slow, it's simple, and you get to really hear me as opposed to all the synthesizers and everything in the background," [...] and compared the second single, [...] "Long Way 2 Go," [...] to Vanity 6's vibe. [...] "I'm hoping to show I can do a wide range of things," [...] concluding, [...] "The whole album really just goes back to love songs." ...|$|E

2500|$|Not {{involved}} in top level football in 1972, Farmer {{returned to the}} VFL {{as coach of the}} Geelong Football Club from 1973 to 1975. Farmer and the club’s committee had an increasingly strained relationship, and Farmer quit in 1975. He returned to the WANFL, coaching East Perth from 1976 to 1977 with some success, and he coached the first Western Australian state of origin team in 1977. Farmer was sacked as coach of East Perth in 1977 due to conflict, and replaced by Barry Cable in 1978. Farmer said, “When the going gets tough a club should stick together and fight to beat it. But some people chip and chip at the ground underneath you in trying to find someone to blame. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> best in football and I have no time to protect my back, so it's left wide open.

2500|$|Touch the Clouds and {{his band}} finally {{returned}} in February 1878 to the Cheyenne River Reservation in central South Dakota. [...] He lived there {{the remainder of his}} life.

By this time, only three of the traditional six headmen of the tribe were still alive. [...] In 1882, the Minneconjou either affirmed or appointed new leaders to fill vacancies. [...] Touch the Clouds was confirmed as a [...] "shirt wearer" [...] to fill the position of his late father. The other new leaders selected included White Bull, Big Crow, White Swan and Touch the Bear.

2500|$|While Yanni {{has said}} that new age is [...] "a spiritual {{definition}} more than a musical definition," [...] his music has been said to be [...] "adopted by" [...] the New Age movement as it gained mainstream momentum. His music is also called contemporary instrumental and {{has been described as}} [...] "an instrumental blend of fusion-jazz, world music, classical, and soft rock." [...] However, at least as early as 1988, Yanni was said to shun labels such as [...] "Greek" [...] and [...] "new age," [...] emphasizing that [...] "when someone says new age music, I think of something that you put on in the background while you're vacuuming the house. I don't want to relax the audience; I want to engage them in the music, get them interested." [...] Distinguishing his work from what others have called ambient mood music, Yanni pointed out in 1994: [...] "New age implies a more subdued, more relaxed music than what <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> <b>My</b> music can be very rhythmic, very energetic, even very ethnic." ...|$|E
2500|$|Child {{maintains}} that the only proof that Putnam was at the redoubt during the action is letter written by John Trumbull, who, years after the battle, {{had a conversation with}} British Colonel John Small in London. Small had claimed {{that he was in the}} advancing British line during the second attack on the redoubt and that almost everyone in front was killed or wounded by a volley fired from within the redoubt. Small says he was not hit but thought for sure he was about to be killed as several of the rebels trained their muskets on him, at which point Putnam reportedly shouted to the rebels [...] "For God's sake lads, don't fire at that man; I love him as <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> brother!" [...] Child dismisses the story that Small was out in front of the line, knowing at the time that the rebels had proved to be excellent marksman and were earnestly picking off British officers, and because it was customary for British officers to march behind rank and file, especially when they are advancing and preparing for a charge with fixed bayonets.|$|E
2500|$|From 1993 to 2000, Sauvage {{won every}} IAAF {{wheelchair}} demonstration event. [...] In that same period, she {{also won the}} demonstration events for wheelchair racing in the 800meter race at the Olympic games. The 800meter event does not require that athletes stay in their lanes after the first turn. [...] For this reason, athletes like Sauvage are required to wear helmets when racing. In 2000, Sauvage won the Olympic demonstration event and was expected to win the Paralympic gold. [...] She was upset by Canadian Chantal Petitclerc. The Australian delegation appealed the result, claiming the race was not fair because another racer, Ireland's Patrice Dockery, was disqualified for leaving her lane too early. The appeal was rejected, because Dockery was too far behind the front runners to impact the results. Sport academics who research the Paralympic Games consider this protest to be pivotal, because it shows the passion of athletes to win and the extent that sports people will go to claim gold. It also highlighted that the rivalries in the sport were real. Petitclerc said of her rivalry with Sauvage that [...] "I dream more about Louise than <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> boyfriend." [...] In 2002, Petitclerc beat Sauvage again at the 2002 Commonwealth Games, where the 800meter event was a full medal event at the games for the first time. It was {{only the second time}} that Sauvage had lost to Petitclerc.|$|E

[...] Though she had falls on both bars and beam on day one, and a major loss of formation on bars during day two, she placed seventh in the all-around with a two-day combined score of 117.650. In event finals, she placed first on vault scoring 31.700 and fifth on floor scoring 29.700. Afterwards, Maroney was chosen {{as a member of the}} team that was sent to the 2012 Summer Olympics.
