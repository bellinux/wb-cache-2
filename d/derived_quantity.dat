The kernel describes some number (e.g., m) of ways in which these vectors can be combined to produce a zero vector. These correspond to producing (from the measurements) a number of dimensionless quantities, {π1, ..., πm}. (In fact these ways completely span the null subspace of another different space, of powers of the measurements.)

2500|$|In this definition, for {{the sake}} of {{conceptual}} rigour, the quantity of energy transferred as heat is not specified directly in terms of the non-adiabatic process. It is defined through knowledge of precisely two variables, the change of internal energy and the amount of adiabatic work done, for the combined process of change from the reference state [...] to the arbitrary state [...] It is important that this does not explicitly involve the amount of energy transferred in the non-adiabatic component of the combined process. It is assumed here that the amount of energy required to pass from state [...] to state , the change of internal energy, is known, independently of the combined process, by a determination through a purely adiabatic process, like that for the determination of the internal energy of state [...] above. The rigour that is prized in this definition is that there is one and only one kind of energy transfer admitted as fundamental: energy transferred as work. Energy transfer as heat is considered as a <b>derived</b> <b>quantity.</b> The uniqueness of work in this scheme is considered to guarantee rigor and purity of conception. The conceptual purity of this definition, based on the concept of energy transferred as work as an ideal notion, relies on the idea that some frictionless and otherwise non-dissipative processes of energy transfer can be realized in physical actuality. The second law of thermodynamics, on the other hand, assures us that such processes are not found in nature.|$|E

5000|$|If, as {{is usually}} the case, the PDF of the <b>derived</b> <b>quantity</b> has not been found, {{and even if the}} PDFs of the {{measured}} quantities are not known, it turns out that it is still possible to estimate the mean and variance (and, thus, the standard deviation) of the <b>derived</b> <b>quantity.</b> This so-called [...] "differential method" [...] will be described next.

40|$|Numerical {{functions}} {{or equivalent}} algorithms {{are commonly used}} to derive estimates for physical quantities that can be {{expressed in terms of}} more fundamental physical parameters. It is shown that in situations where large uncertainties (errors) are involved in these parameters, or where error amplification occurs through severe non-linearity of the functions, conventional deterministic techniques for calculating the <b>derived</b> <b>quantities</b> and estimating their errors can lead to erroneous results. Instead, it is necessary to resort to a probabilistic approach and thereby obtain estimates for mean values and variances of the <b>derived</b> <b>quantities</b> through Monte Carlo simulation in order to preserve the essential information without distortion. The correct choice for a probability distribution is suggested by the inherent nature of the random variable in question. Examples are given from the analysis of radioactivity decay, the shielding of penetrating radiation, and the derivation of nuclear reaction rates that are used in astrophysical calculations to model nucleosynthesis of the elements in stellar explosions.
