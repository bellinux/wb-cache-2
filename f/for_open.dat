5|$|A {{downline}} used <b>for</b> <b>open</b> ocean diving is {{much the}} same as a shotline, but does not reach {{all the way to the}} bottom. An open-ocean downline is weighted at the bottom, and attached to a substantial float at the surface, which may be tethered to the boat. It may be marked at intervals by knots or loops, and may be attached to decompression trapeze system. In some cases a sea anchor may be used to limit wind drift, particularly if attached to a boat with significant windage.|$|E
5|$|As {{chair of}} the Select Standing Committee on Finance and Government Services, Howard {{supported}} Premier Campbell's efforts at establishing the Harmonized Sales Tax. Following Campbell's resignation, Howard endorsed Kevin Falcon but Christy Clark won the leadership election. Clark eventually made Howard a Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of Transportation. In this position he advocated <b>for</b> <b>Open</b> Sky agreements and continued this advocacy in his post-political life by establishing the non-profit organization OpenSkies4Canada. Howard did not seek re-election during the 2013 provincial election {{and was replaced by}} BC Liberal Teresa Wat.|$|E

5|$|Aurobindo was {{influenced}} by studies on rebellion and revolutions against England in medieval France and the revolts in America and Italy. In his public activities he favoured non-co-operation and passive resistance; in private he took up secret revolutionary activity as a preparation <b>for</b> <b>open</b> revolt, in case that the passive revolt failed.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Wayne Gerth and David Doolette {{published}} VVal 18 and VVal 18M {{parameter sets}} for tables and programs based on the Thalmann E-L algorithm, and produce an internally compatible set of decompression tables <b>for</b> <b>open</b> circuit and CCR on air and Nitrox, including in water air/oxygen decompression and surface decompression on oxygen.

5|$|Switzerland {{also has}} an {{economic}} system for garbage disposal, which is based mostly on recycling and energy-producing incinerators {{due to a lack}} of space <b>for</b> <b>open</b> pit garbage disposals. As in other European countries, the Illegal disposal of garbage is not tolerated but usually the enforcement of such laws is limited to violations that involve the unlawful disposal of garbage bags at traffic intersections and public areas. In some cities, stickers need to be purchased that allow for identification of disposable garbage.|$|E

5|$|The {{best time}} for {{whitewater}} boating on Loyalsock Creek at Worlds End State Park is from March to May, and the park hosts a slalom race on Loyalsock Creek each spring. The whitewater gradient is 41 for {{the section of the}} creek in and near the park, and its rating on the International Scale of River Difficulty is II to III+, with sections reaching IV. The water is too swift <b>for</b> <b>open</b> canoes, so visitors are asked to use kayaks. The swimming area is closed to whitewater boating during the summer months.|$|E

5|$|The {{cane toad}} {{is an old}} species. A fossil toad (specimen UCMP 41159) from the La Venta fauna of the late Miocene of Colombia is indistinguishable from modern cane toads from {{northern}} South America.

5|$|A {{somewhat}} controversial recent {{addition to}} Caversham was the opening, in October 2013, of Whakamana Cannabis Museum, New Zealand's first museum {{dedicated to the}} history of cannabis use. Cannabis, while still a criminalised drug in New Zealand, has moved some way towards grudging acceptance, at least as a subject <b>for</b> <b>open</b> discussion. The museum, run from a former residential house in David Street, is designed to be an information centre on aspects of the history and legislation surrounding the drug, and also a national centre for the Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party, a minor single-issue political party.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to public view in 2009, Townsend began endorsing Peavey, and later released a PXD Devin Townsend signature model, essentially a Flying V-style 7-string baritone guitar with an EMG 81-7 pickup and a 7-string EMG SA single coil pickup {{in the neck}} position. Peavey also made Townsend a number of custom 7-strings, including one with a single EMG 81-7 pickup that is used for playing most of the material on Ziltoid The Omniscient. Aside from his signature model, Townsend also utilizes two custom 6-string Predator models made by Peavey; one with a natural flame-top finish and the DTP logo on the 12th fret, and one in a black finish with a Floyd Rose vibrato unit (<b>for</b> <b>Open</b> C and Open B tuning, respectively).|$|E

5|$|At that time, the {{demography}} for the PlayStation shifted as more {{teenagers and}} children started {{to use the}} console to play video games. As a result, the team decided not to make another violent game like Disruptor and instead develop a family-friendly game that would be suitable for every member of a family, regardless of their age. The family game market was dominated by Sony's competitor Nintendo with games like Super Mario 64, while the PlayStation has no similar exclusives. Cerny later pushed Insomniac Games to develop a game with a mascot and mass appeal. An environment artist of Disruptor, Craig Stitt proposed that the game's theme and story should revolve around an anthropomorphic dragon. At the same time, Alex Hastings began developing an engine that specialized in games with panoramic view, which is suitable <b>for</b> <b>open</b> world games. The engine allowed more gameplay features including the ability for the dragon to glide through air. Spyro the Dragon was released in late 1998.|$|E
5|$|Auto Club Speedway, {{formerly}} California Speedway, is a two-mile (3km), low-banked, D-shaped oval superspeedway in Fontana, California {{which has}} hosted NASCAR racing annually since 1997. It {{is also used}} <b>for</b> <b>open</b> wheel racing events. The racetrack is located near the former locations of Ontario Motor Speedway and Riverside International Raceway. The track is {{owned and operated by}} International Speedway Corporation and is the only track owned by ISC to have naming rights sold. The speedway is served by the nearby Interstate 10 and Interstate 15 freeways as well as a Metrolink station located behind the backstretch.|$|E
5|$|By 10:00, {{all three}} French ships were {{within range of}} Centurion and a heavy {{exchange}} of fire began. Within 15 minutes, both Centurion and Marengo had their colours shot away and at 10:45 the ship of the line turned away <b>for</b> <b>open</b> water, followed by the frigates, her rigging in disarray. Damage had rendered Centurion unable to manoeuvre rapidly and she began slowly limping inshore to shelter from Marengo among the coastal shoals. Captain Lind rejoined his ship by boat, hailing the Princess Charlotte, which had still not participated in the battle, to cut her anchor cables and go ashore to avoid being captured. Logan refused and at 11:15 surrendered without a fight as the whole French squadron moved back towards the harbour. Marengo again remained beyond the sandbars that marked the entrance. The boatloads of sepoys, who were still en route to Princess Charlotte, turned about and rowed back to shore to avoid capture. SÃ©millante took possession of the merchant ship while Marengo and Atalante engaged Centurion, which had moved {{out of range of}} support from the shore batteries.|$|E

5|$|Despite strong {{warnings}} {{that it was}} a bad idea, the War Cabinet decided to impose conscription on Ireland in 1918. The main reason was that labour in Britain demanded it as the price for cutting back on exemptions for certain workers. Labour wanted the principle established that no one was exempt, but it did not demand that conscription should actually take place in Ireland. The proposal was enacted, but never enforced. The Roman Catholic bishops for the first time entered the fray, calling <b>for</b> <b>open</b> resistance to compulsory military service, while the majority of Irish nationalists moved to supporting the intransigent Sinn FÃ©in movement (away from the constitutional Irish National Party). This proved a decisive moment, marking the end of Irish willingness to stay inside the Union.|$|E
5|$|In February 1957, Melbourne {{was sent}} to the Royal Hobart Regatta. Following this, she {{travelled}} to New Zealand, where she participated in exercises with HMNZS Royalist and visited several New Zealand ports. The first of several annual three-month deployments to Southeast Asia as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve began in April, with Melbourne returning to Darwin at the end of June. The carrier {{spent the rest of the}} year visiting Australian ports <b>for</b> <b>open</b> inspections by the public. During the visit to Port Adelaide, on 28 October 1957, Melbourne was slightly damaged when she was struck by MV Straat Lankaâ€”the first of several minor collisions the carrier would experience throughout her career. Operations for the year concluded with participation in Exercise Astrolabe off Lord Howe Island, with ships from the RAN, Royal Navy, and Royal New Zealand Navy, before returning to Sydney on 13 December.|$|E
5|$|In November 2006, first-generation {{symmetric}} multiprocessing (SMP) clients were publicly released <b>for</b> <b>open</b> beta testing, {{referred to as}} SMP1. These clients used Message Passing Interface (MPI) communication protocols for parallel processing, as {{at that time the}} GROMACS cores were not designed to be used with multiple threads. This was the first time a distributed computing project had used MPI. Although the clients performed well in Unix-based operating systems such as Linux and macOS, they were troublesome under Windows. On January24, 2010, SMP2, the second generation of the SMP clients and the successor to SMP1, was released as an open beta and replaced the complex MPI with a more reliable thread-based implementation.|$|E
