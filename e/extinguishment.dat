5|$|The {{practical}} construction {{given by}} the state of New York to the federal constitution, as shown by the numerous treaties made by it with the Indian tribes, and the recognition by the federal authority of their validity, is very strong evidence that the clause in the federal constitution prohibiting the states from entering into treaties does not preclude a state, having the preemption right to Indian lands, from dealing with the Indian tribes directly, for the <b>extinguishment</b> of the Indian title.|$|E
25|$|The old {{view was}} that the <b>extinguishment</b> of {{aboriginal}} title extinguished all tribal rights to the same land. The current view is that usufructory rights pursuant to a treaty may survive the <b>extinguishment</b> of aboriginal title. However, such usufructs may be lost when tribes cede land to the federal government. Certain usufructs may be extinguished by implication.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{test for}} <b>extinguishment</b> of {{aboriginal}} title was most thoroughly explained in United States v. Santa Fe Pacific R. Co. (1941): <b>extinguishment</b> {{must come from}} Congress, or {{a part of the}} federal government properly delegated by Congress, and must satisfy a clear statement rule. The earliest and most widely acknowledged method of extinguishing aboriginal title was by treaty. Even fraud will not void the <b>extinguishment</b> of aboriginal title by the federal government (or by any actor, if the tribe waives the issue in the lower court). Some cases hold that an executive order may extinguish aboriginal title, although the dominant view is that the power lies with Congress.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Does the {{placement}} of a line item in the income statement matter to investors? The passage of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 145 (Financial Accounting Standards Board [FASB] 2002) affords a quasi-experimental setting to answer this question, because pre-SFAS No. 145, gains/losses from early debt <b>extinguishments</b> were reported below the line, while post-SFAS No. 145, they were reported above the line. After controlling for other identified changes that occur during our sample period, we find that, pre-SFAS No. 145, the market does not respond to these gains/losses, whereas post-SFAS No. 145, it does. This suggests that the market response to gains/losses is associated with their placement in the income statement. Our findings contribute to {{the literature on the}} importance of income statement presentation by demonstrating that a line-item position in the income statement has important valuation implications...|$|R
40|$|Forests play an {{important}} role for sustaining the natural environment of human living. Forest fires not only destroy natural environment and ecological equivalence, but also threaten security of life and wealth to people. This paper presents applications of Spatio-temporal Data Mining and Knowledge Discovering (STDMKD) for forest fire prevention. The special attention of the research is paid to the spatio-temporal forecasting of forest fires because of the importance of prediction for the fire prevention. It is also {{due to the fact that}} most existing spatio-temporal forecasting methods cannot handle the dynamic development of forest fires over space. An improved spatio-temporal integrated forecasting framework – ISTIFF is proposed. The method and algorithm of ISTIFF are presented, which are illustrated by a case study of forest fire area predication in Canada. Comparative analysis of ISTIFF with other methods is implemented, which shows its high accuracy in short-term prediction. Based upon the forecasting result, more intelligent strategies of fire prevention and <b>extinguishments</b> can be delivered to decision makers in fireproofing. 1. INTRODCUTION Forests play {{an important}} role for sustaining the natural environment people live in.

40|$|Electrically {{controlled}} extinguishable solid propellants (ESCSP) {{are capable}} of multiple ignitions, <b>extinguishments</b> and throttle control by the application of electrical power. Both core and end burning no moving parts ECESP grains/motors to three inches in diameter have now been tested. Ongoing research {{has led to a}} newer family of even higher performance ECESP providing up to 10 % higher Isp, manufacturing ease, and significantly higher electrical conduction. The high conductivity was not found to be desirable for larger motors; however it is ideal for downward scaling to micro and pico-propulsion applications with a web thickness of less than 0. 125 inch. As a solid solution propellant, this ECESP is molecularly uniform, having no granular structure. Because of this homogeneity and workable viscosity it can be directly cast into thin layers or vacuum cast into complex geometries. Both coaxial and grain stacks have been demonstrated. Combining individual propellant coaxial grains and/or grain stacks together form three-dimensional arrays of modular cluster thrusters. Adoption of fabless manufacturing methods and standards from the electronics industry will provide custom, highly reproducible micro-propulsion arrays and clusters at low costs. These stack and cluster thruster designs provide a small footprint saving spacecraft surface area for solar panels and/or experiments. The simplicity of these thrusters will enable their broad use on micro-pico satellites for primary propulsion, ACS and formation flying applications. Larger spacecraft may find uses for ECESP thrusters on extended booms, on-orbit refueling, pneumatic actuators, and gas generators...|$|R

25|$|Since 1790, {{states have}} not been able to {{extinguish}} aboriginal title. They cannot even foreclose on tribal lands due to the non-payment of taxes. However, <b>extinguishment</b> by state governments before between independence and 1790 is generally valid. The Second Circuit has held that states retained the power to purchase land directly from tribes during the Articles of Confederation period, and thus those purchases remain valid even if un-ratified by the federal government.|$|E
25|$|Aboriginal title can be {{extinguished}} by {{the general}} government, but again, the requirement to do this varies by country. Some require the legislature to be explicit when it does this, others hold that <b>extinguishment</b> can be inferred from the government's treatment of the land. In Canada, the Crown cannot extinguish aboriginal title without the explicit prior informed consent of the proper aboriginal title holders. New Zealand formerly required consent, but today requires only a justification, akin to a public purpose requirement.|$|E
25|$|The Confederation Congress Proclamation of 1783 {{prohibited}} the <b>extinguishment</b> of aboriginal title {{without the consent}} of Congress.

These purchases were not tested in court until the 1970s and 1980s, when the Second Circuit held that the Confederation Congress had neither the authority under the Articles of Confederation nor the intent to limit the ability of states to extinguish aboriginal title within their borders; thus, the Proclamation was interpreted to apply only to the federal territories.|$|E
25|$|Tillamooks I (1946) was {{the closest}} the Supreme Court ever came to holding that unrecognized {{aboriginal}} title is property under the Fifth Amendment. Although the suit had been instituted under a special jurisdictional statute waiving the defense of sovereign immunity, the Court ordered compensation even while insisting that the statute itself had not created a property right; only the dissent referred to the Fifth Amendment. According to the Ninth Circuit in Miller v. United States (1947), Tillamooks I held that even unrecognized aboriginal title is property under the Fifth Amendment, the <b>extinguishment</b> of which requires just compensation. Although the issue was not raised in the case, a footnote in Hynes v. Grimes Packing (1949) repudiated the 9th Circuit view and insisted that aboriginal title was non-compensable. Tillamooks II (1951) appeared to accept the Hynes view by denying interest to the compensation paid on remand following Tillamooks I.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Extinguishment</b> can be {{accomplished}} through res judicata. [...] <b>Extinguishment</b> may also be effected through collateral estoppel following a final decision by a Court of Claims. Even before a final ICC judgement, if a tribe claims compensation {{on the theory that}} its lands were extinguished, it cannot later attempt to claim valid title to those lands. An ICC judgement acts as a bar to future claims, and an ICC payment conclusively establishes <b>extinguishment</b> (although, for timing purposes, the ICC has not jurisdiction to extinguish). Even though ICCA settlements are binding, the scope of the settlement may be up for debate. The United States is bound by prior determinations as well.|$|E
2500|$|The {{power of}} Congress to {{extinguish}} aboriginal title—by [...] "purchase or conquest," [...] {{or with a}} clear statement—is plenary and exclusive. Such <b>extinguishment</b> is not compensable under the Fifth Amendment, although various statutes provide for compensation.

After numerous attempts and failures to bring about emancipation, Jefferson wrote privately in an 1805 letter to William A. Burwell, [...] "I have long since given up the expectation of any early provision for the <b>extinguishment</b> of slavery among us."
