40|$|We {{impose a}} value {{judgment}} that {{a decrease in}} failure should {{be accompanied by a}} decrease in gap (difference or ratio) between sub-groups. In other words, the same gap at lower levels of failure is to be considered worse off. This, in line with transfer sensitivity axiom of poverty indices, is formalized by Mishra and Subramanian (2006) through two level-sensitive axioms in group differential measures. In addition, Mishra (2007) imposes an axiom of normalization. At a basic level it means that the group <b>differential</b> <b>measure</b> lies between zero and unity. However, at a fundamental level it should also mean that zero indicates no differential between the two sub-groups whereas unity indicates maximum differential between the two sub-groups. A group <b>differential</b> <b>measure</b> discussed in the above-mentioned two papers satisfied the level-sensitivity axioms but failed the normalization axiom at a fundamental level. Further, the comparison between two situations under this measure also happened to be dependent on the choice of some parameters. Both these problems are done away with in the measure proposed in this paper. Empirical illustration with infant mortality rate data for selected Indian states ha...|$|E

After discussing some existing notions of solution for such systems, we derive Lyapunov-based conditions on the system's vector fields for asymptotic stability under a specific class of inputs. These conditions are based on the stability margin of the Lebesgue-integrable and the measure-driven components of the system. For more general inputs which do not necessarily lead to asymptotic stability, we then derive conditions such that the maximum norm of the resulting trajectory is bounded by some function of the total variation of the input, which generalizes the notion of integral input-to-state stability in measure-driven systems.

So far there have been few attempts to use information theoretic concepts related in the interpretation of images. This is in contrast to physics, where in the eighties the combination of computer simulations and information theoretic analysis of complex systems got much attention [Eriksson and Lindgren 1987].

40|$|Abstract Mandarin Chinese has two {{strategies}} for forming comparatives of superiority: {{one in which}} the standard of comparison is introduced by the morpheme bi, and one that resembles a transitive verb construction, in which the standard of comparison directly follows a gradable adjective. The ‘transitive comparative’ exhibits two special restrictions: the predicate must be one that accepts <b>differential</b> <b>measure</b> phrases, and the measure phrase must be overt. We argue that these facts support an analysis of the syntax of the adjectival projection in which gradable adjectives do not project degree arguments, as typically assumed, but do so only in combination with a covert morpheme l. Building on the proposal that argument DPs in Mandarin require Case, we hypothesize that there are (at least) two case assigners for standards of comparison in Mandarin: the overt morpheme bi and the covert morpheme l found in transitive comparatives...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} of variation in the semantics of degree constructions between English and Yoruba (Niger-Congo, Nigeria). The main question addressed is whether variation between the two languages can be best explained by a parameter, proposed in Beck et al. 2004 and Beck et al. 2009, regulating the (in) ability of a language to bind variables of type 〈d〉: the "Degree Abstraction Parameter " (DAP). It is argued that Yoruba requires bound variables of type 〈d 〉 (a +DAP setting) to explain facts relating to degree relatives and degree questions. These findings differ from those of Beck et al. (2009) who claim, primarily on the basis of data from scope ambiguities in the comparative, that Yoruba has a-DAP status. We propose an alternative account of the lack of scope ambiguities which rests on differences in the semantics of <b>differential</b> <b>measure</b> phrases in Yoruba and English...|$|E

However, the upflow flow creates a dominant cooling which works against the conductive heating, resulting in a steeper temperature gradient with a shallower transition region.

Exploratory factor analysis confirmed a 5 -factor solution structure of the BIS/BAS scales, with BIS-scale divided into BIS-Anxiety and BIS-Fear factors, besides the original three BAS factors. BIS-Anxiety was found to represent Gray’s anxiety (high Neuroticism and low Extraversion), being also distinguished from BIS-Fear by high Agreeableness, as expected. Interestingly, Conscientiousness showed divergent relationships to BIS-Anxiety (+) and BIS-Fear (−) as well. It is noteworthy that Agreeableness and Conscientiousness also marked distinct facets of BAS-related activity: distinctions in terms of low vs. high Conscientiousness pointed to <b>differential</b> <b>measure</b> of sensation-seeking and impulsiveness (BAS-Fun Seeking) vs. reward-orientation in goal-directed behavior (BAS-Reward Responsiveness, BAS-Drive), with low Agreeableness additionally emphasizing a competitive interpersonal style for approaching goals (BAS-Drive).
