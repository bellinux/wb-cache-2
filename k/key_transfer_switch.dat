5000|$|An open {{transition}} <b>transfer</b> <b>switch</b> is {{also called}} a break-before-make <b>transfer</b> <b>switch.</b> A break-before-make <b>transfer</b> <b>switch</b> breaks contact with {{one source of}} power before it makes contact with another. It prevents backfeeding from an emergency generator back into the utility line, for example.One example is an open transition automatic <b>transfer</b> <b>switch</b> (ATS).

50|$|A <b>transfer</b> <b>switch</b> is an {{electrical}} switch that switches a load between two sources. Some <b>transfer</b> <b>switches</b> are manual, in that an operator effects the transfer by throwing a switch, {{while others are}} automatic and trigger when they sense one of the sources has lost or gained power.|$|R
5000|$|As well as {{transferring}} the load to the backup generator, an ATS may also command the backup generator to start, {{based on the}} voltage monitored on the primary supply. The <b>transfer</b> <b>switch</b> isolates the backup generator from the electric utility when the generator is on and providing temporary power. The control capability of a <b>transfer</b> <b>switch</b> may be manual only, {{or a combination of}} automatic and manual. The switch transition mode (see below) of a <b>transfer</b> <b>switch</b> may be Open Transition (OT) (the usual type), or Closed Transition (CT)).|$|R

5000|$|With regular generators, an {{automatic}} <b>transfer</b> <b>switch</b> {{is used to}} connect emergency power. One side is connected to both the normal power feed and the emergency power feed; {{and the other side}} is connected to the load designated as emergency. If no electricity comes in on the normal side, the <b>transfer</b> <b>switch</b> uses a solenoid to throw a triple pole, single throw switch. This switches the feed from normal to emergency power. The loss of normal power also triggers a battery operated starter system to start the generator, similar to using a car battery to start an engine. Once the <b>transfer</b> <b>switch</b> is switched and the generator starts, the building's emergency power comes back on (after going off when normal power was lost.) ...|$|R

50|$|A standby {{generator}} is a back-up {{electrical system}} that operates automatically. Within seconds of a utility outage an automatic <b>transfer</b> <b>switch</b> senses the power loss, commands the generator {{to start and}} then transfers the electrical load to the generator. The standby generator begins supplying power to the circuits. After utility power returns, the automatic <b>transfer</b> <b>switch</b> <b>transfers</b> the electrical load back to the utility and signals the standby generator to shut off. It then returns to standby mode where it awaits the next outage. To ensure a proper response to an outage, a standby generator runs weekly self-tests.

40|$|Abstract: Group <b>key</b> <b>transfer</b> {{protocols}} {{depend on}} a mutually trusted key generation center (KGC) to transport the group key to all group members secretly. This approach requires that a trusted sever be set up, and it incurs communication overhead costs. In addition, the existing group <b>key</b> <b>transfer</b> protocols based on secret sharing all use threshold schemes that need to compute a t-degree interpolating polynomial to encrypt and decrypt the secret group key, then it increases the computational complexity of system. In this paper, we first present a novel group <b>key</b> <b>transfer</b> protocol without an online KGC, {{which is based on}} DH key agreement and a perfect linear secret sharing scheme (LSSS). The confidentiality of the group <b>key</b> <b>transfer</b> phase of this protocol is information theoretically secure, which is ensured by this LSSS.

40|$|The {{inconsistency}} {{of power}} supply in Nigeria {{has been a}} major stumbling block to the advancement of her economy and as such it is an issue that requires immediate attention. Uninterrupted power supply is critical in so many applications especially in cases like hospital operations or financial transactions.
