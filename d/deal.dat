5|$|Although <b>Deal</b> was the bassist of the Pixies, {{she wanted}} to play guitar for the Breeders, because she felt it was an easier {{instrument}} to handle when singing at the same time. <b>Deal</b> recruited Josephine Wiggs of Perfect Disaster to be the Breeders' bassist; the two knew each other from when Perfect Disaster had toured with the Pixies in Europe in 1989. <b>Deal</b> wanted Steve Albini to record the album; she had previously worked {{with him on the}} Pixies' Surfer Rosa. She hoped to have Kelley <b>Deal</b> be the Breeders' drummer, but the latter was not able to take time away from her program analyst job. Albini suggested they try Britt Walford of the band Slint instead. Before recording began, <b>Deal,</b> Wiggs, and Walford rehearsed at Wiggs' house in Bedfordshire, England for a week, and then joined Donelly in London to practice more. Albini was involved in the pre-production of the songs, which Donelly found beneficial.|$|E

5|$|Barkley, {{recently}} {{chosen as}} Senate Majority Leader {{by a single}} vote, was {{a strong supporter of}} President Roosevelt and the New <b>Deal.</b> Chandler identified with the more conservative southern Democrats who, wary of Roosevelt and his New <b>Deal,</b> sought to gain control of the party ahead of the 1940 presidential election. Because Roosevelt was very popular in Kentucky, Chandler was put in the awkward position of expressing personal support of the president while opposing his hand-picked leader in the Senate and his New <b>Deal</b> legislation. In April, polls showed Barkley ahead of Chandler by a 2-to-1 margin, and the May 3 primary victory of New <b>Deal</b> Florida Senator Claude Pepper finally persuaded Chandler to abandon his attacks of the program.|$|E

5|$|From the {{formation}} of the Breeders in 1989 until the mid-1990s, the line-up changed several times. Vocalist and songwriter Kim <b>Deal</b> was the band's sole consistent member. The line-up that recorded the group's debut Pod (released in 1990) included guitarist Tanya Donelly and drummer Britt Walford; they were replaced by Deal's sister Kelley and Jim Macpherson by the time the band's 1993 album Last Splash was recorded. Kelley <b>Deal</b> and original bassist Josephine Wiggs left in 1995. Kim <b>Deal</b> formed the Amps that year, but reformed the Breeders in 1996—initially using the Amps' line-up: <b>Deal</b> (vocals), Macpherson (drums), Luis Lerma (bass), and Nate Farley (guitar).|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the incentives for oligopolistic manufacturers to adopt exclusive <b>dealing.</b> Manufacturers producing differentiated brands {{can choose to}} distribute through exclusive retail dealerships or nonexclusive dealerships. With nonexclusive <b>dealing,</b> manufacturers face an interbrand externality because brand-enhancing investments made by one manufacturer may benefit the brands of other manufacturers. Although exclusive <b>dealing</b> eliminates this externality, oligopolistic manufacturers may not choose exclusive <b>dealing.</b> Exclusive <b>dealing</b> enhances the incentive to invest, but the promotional investments are a form of competition between manufacturers. Thus, manufacturers might earn higher profits with nonexclusive <b>dealing</b> making lower promotional investments. We find cases in which nonexclusive <b>dealing</b> is a dominant strategy. We also find cases in which some, but not all, manufacturers adopt exclusive <b>dealing.</b> Moreover, even if adoption of exclusive <b>dealing</b> by all manufacturers is the equilibrium, it can arise from a prisoner's dilemma in that each manufacturer would prefer nonexclusive <b>dealing.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|It is {{not known}} who {{designed}} <b>Deal</b> Castle, but Sir Edward Ryngeley and Thomas Wingfield served as the commissioners for the project, with Robert Loyrde and David Marten as the paymaster and comptroller, and Christopher Dickenson and William Clement as the master mason and carpenters.

5|$|Later in 1996, <b>Deal</b> {{changed the}} name of the group back to the Breeders, {{originally}} with almost the same line-up as the Amps. Until then, <b>Deal</b> had been waiting for Wiggs and Kelley to rejoin the Breeders and record a new album together, and had held back from reforming the Breeders out of respect for them. In May 1996, Wiggs revealed that she would not be involved in any immediate Breeders activity; Kelley also chose to stay in Saint Paul, to be close to her rehabilitation facility. <b>Deal</b> then decided that {{she did not want to}} wait any longer to reform the group, partly because the Breeders' repertoire was larger than the Amps', thereby allowing longer concerts. <b>Deal</b> added violinist Carrie Bradley (who had played on the Breeders' Pod album), and with Macpherson, Lerma, and Farley, played some shows in 1996 with Primus.|$|E
