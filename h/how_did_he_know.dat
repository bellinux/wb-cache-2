60|$|Now, <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> that? {{he asked}} himself as he went down the stairs.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{if you saw}} him so seldom {{and wrote}} so seldom, <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> enough about your affairs {{to be able to}} help you, as you say that he has done?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, pray, <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> {{the storm}} was approaching?" [...] asked Eve, whose curiosity had been awakened in spite of herself. [...] "It {{could not have been}} that his 'foreknowledge' was supernatural." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He did, eh?" [...] sneered Chris Holtzmann. [...] "He {{had better}} keep his mouth shut. <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> {{but what the}} papers were {{destroyed}} long ago?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My brother {{says the}} bee-hunter has no squaw. <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> this? Has <b>he</b> {{lived in the}} lodge with them--paddled in the same canoe--eat of the same venison? A weasel is very small. It might steal into the bee-hunter's lodge, and see what is there, what is doing, what is eaten, who is his squaw, and who is not--has this weasel ever done so? I never saw him there.|$|R
6000|$|... "Braves," [...] he said, {{looking at}} the {{previous}} speaker with a dark frown, [...] "the Dogribs know nothing of those strange and stupid notions that have {{just come out of}} the lips of Nazinred. He says that this dirty Eskimo is a deep thinker and a man who loves peace. <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> that one of that sort may not think so deeply as to deceive him? <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> that the young man is not a liar--that many of his warriors may not be in our hunting-grounds even at this moment, though he says there are none? As for his talk about the Great Spirit and the future, what <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> about either the one or the other? Is he wiser than the Dogribs? Does his attack on Nazinred look like a lover of peace? His leaving off when he found that Nazinred was his match seems to me more like sly wisdom than the hatred of war. My advice is not to trust these dirty men of the ice, but to take our guns at once and drive them from the land." ...|$|R
60|$|Annie {{asked him}} to please to be more careful, for <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> {{that one of the}} {{servants}} might not be sweeping the front porch, and of course, they would look in at the windows.|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep {{close to}} me," [...] said Mrs. Truefitt, {{who had a}} great horror of the insane. [...] "If he turns violent open the window and scream. I thought he had brought bad news of Fred. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> about him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{will you}} tie up my frock? and may I put the flowers into the broth?' chattered Rayonette. 'And {{why did he}} kiss me and hug me so tight? and <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> what you say over me as we fall asleep?' ...|$|E
2500|$|Wittgenstein {{supplies}} {{the response of}} an imagined interlocutor. He usually puts these statements in quotes to distinguish them from his own: [...] "But <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> where and <b>how</b> he is to look up the word 'red' and what <b>he</b> is to <b>do</b> with the word 'five'?" [...] Or Wittgenstein may indicate such a response by beginning with a long dash, as <b>he</b> <b>does</b> before the question above: —But {{what is the meaning}} of the word 'five'? ...|$|R
6000|$|There are {{thousands}} of folk who believe in Old Moore's Almanac. My difficulty would be not {{to believe in the}} old gentleman. I see that for the month of January last he foretold us that the Government would meet with determined and persistent opposition. He warned us that there would be much sickness about, and that rheumatism would discover its old victims. <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> these things? Is it that the stars really do communicate with him, or <b>does</b> <b>he</b> [...] "feel it in his bones," [...] as the saying is up North? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{take the}} licence {{of an old}} acquaintance, Mary,' said the locksmith, 'who has ever had a warm regard for you, and maybe has tried to prove it when he could. Who is this ill-favoured man, and what has <b>he</b> to <b>do</b> with you? Who is this ghost, that is only seen in the black nights and bad weather? <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>know,</b> and why <b>does</b> <b>he</b> haunt, this house, {{whispering}} through chinks and crevices, {{as if there was}} that between him and you, which neither durst so much as speak aloud of? Who is he?' ...|$|R
6000|$|What, if Hogg {{were the}} forger, were his sources? He MAY have known Douglas's Palice of Honour, which, of course, existed in print, with its mention of Maitland's grey beard. But <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> Maitland's [...] "three noble sons," [...] in 1801-1802, lying unsunned in the Maitland MSS.? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never {{mind the}} darned stitches. How {{did he get}} ahead of us? We hustled all we knew. It's downright {{impossible}} for anyone to get here quicker than we did. And, anyway, <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>know?</b> Do you reckon there was a dictaphone in Jane's room? I guess there must have been." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{walked up}} and down the room. After an interval, his {{thoughts}} took a new direction; the question of the manuscript presented itself under another point of view. Thus far, his reading had only informed him that the conspiracy had been planned. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> that the plan had been put in execution? ...|$|E
60|$|<b>How</b> {{on earth}} <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> that? But then Tod HAD {{a sort of}} queer prescience.|$|R
60|$|MORRIS. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> you <b>know</b> <b>he's</b> a wizard? I {{suppose he}} plays some tricks on you.|$|R
5000|$|The Jains also {{considered}} right knowledge {{as a prerequisite}} for practising [...] It is necessary {{to know what is}} living and what is non-living to practice [...] faultlessly. A person who is confused between Living and non-living can never observe non-violence. Daśavaikālika Sūtra declared: First knowledge, then compassion. Thus does one remain in full control. How can an ignorant person be compassionate, when he cannot distinguish between the good and the evil? It further declares: Knowledge of living and non-living alone will enable one to become compassionate towards all living creatures. Knowing this all aspirants, proceed from knowledge to eternal virtues. What can an ignorant <b>do</b> ? <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> what is noble and what is evil? ...|$|R
6000|$|Next morning, in court, I heard Harold's cross-examination. He {{described}} {{exactly where}} {{he had found the}} contested will in his uncle's escritoire. The cross-eyed Q.C., a heavy man with bloated features and a bulbous nose, begged him, with one fat uplifted forefinger, to be very careful. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> where to look for it? ...|$|E
60|$|He {{could not}} help it. The thought would not leave him that all this might exist without. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>know?</b> How could anyone be sure, quite sure? But he drove the {{thoughts}} away, and in his cell imposed upon himself a penance. It was Satan that stood whispering in his ear, Satan lying in wait for his soul; let him deny God {{and he would be}} damned for ever.|$|E
60|$|It {{is curious}} to see how facts make havoc of the conjectures of the Higher Criticism {{in the case of}} Auld Maitland. If Hogg was the forger of that ballad, I asked, <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> the traditions about Maitland and his three sons, which we only know from poems of about 1576 in the manuscripts of Sir Richard Maitland? These poems in 1802 were, as far as I am aware, still unpublished.|$|E
60|$|He {{wants to}} keep it all to himself. Why should not I have a share of it? He says it will hurt me. <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> that? It <b>does</b> not hurt him. I must be the best judge of whether it will hurt me. I {{do not believe that}} it will: but at least it is but fair that I should try. I will try for myself. I will run the chance. Why should I be kept like a baby, as if I had no sense or will of my own? I will know the right and the wrong of it for myself. I will know the good and evil of it myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>how</b> {{the devil}} <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> {{where to find}} me!" [...] exclaimed the vice-admiral, holding {{out a hand to}} receive the communication.|$|R
5000|$|After Imam Ali set him free, {{he greeted}} Salim {{by the name}} Maytham. Maytham was the name that his mother gave to him after his birth; no one in Kufa knew that Maytham was Salim's real name. Upon hearing a {{stranger}} calling him by Maytham, Salim was shocked, baffled, and astonished that a person other than his parents knew about his real name (Maytham). He questioned Imam Ali as to <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> that Maytham was his real name. Imam Ali replied, [...] "Come with me do not worry. Allah's Apostle (Prophet Muhammad) has {{told me that the}} Iranians call you Maytham. Still shocked, Maytham willing went with Imam Ali who would later become his best friend and teacher.|$|R
60|$|Kurt hired a {{young man}} he knew to drive him over to Wheatly. All the way Kurt brooded about his father's strange action. The old man had left home before the rain-storm. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> he could {{guarantee}} so many bushels of wheat as the selling-price indicated? Kurt divined {{that his father had}} acted upon one of his strange weather prophecies. For he must have been absolutely sure of rain to save the wheat.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is right, Clinton," [...] Easton said; [...] "that is {{the view}} I take of it myself, and I am very {{glad to see that}} you have come to see it in that light. And now will you tell us what there was in that letter that gave us the news of your brother's being out here. How came the {{sergeant}} to write to you? <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> you were his brother? It seems an unaccountable business all through." ...|$|E
6000|$|Smoke pondered a few minutes, {{then again}} broke silence. [...] "Say, Shorty. Forty {{thousand}} dollars gold weighs two hundred pounds. Wild Water borrowed our sled and team to haul away his eggs. He {{came up the}} hill without a sled. Those two sacks of dust in his coat pockets weighed about twenty pounds each. The understanding was cash on delivery. He brought enough dust {{to pay for the}} good eggs. He never expected to pay for those three thousand. He knew they were bad. Now <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> they were bad? What do you make of it, anyway?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It must be him. Jolly good cheek; I simply can't understand. I shall {{go and see}} him. <b>How</b> {{on earth}} <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> your address?" ...|$|R
60|$|O'FLAHERTY. She {{asked me}} <b>how</b> <b>did</b> I <b>know</b> <b>he</b> wasn't, and fetched me a clout {{on the side}} of my head.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; he {{said that}} the officer had given you the letter that I dropped to him; yet <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> come to <b>know</b> that you were my cousin?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Toward {{the end of}} {{our little}} {{promenade}} I was guilty of impatiently shaking off a sudden seizure of my arm in his big paw. If ever, in an hour, the Elsinore had been less gymnastic than at that moment, I had not noticed it. So I shook off the sustaining clutch, and the next moment the Elsinore had smashed down and buried a couple of hundred feet of her starboard rail beneath the sea, while I had shot down the deck and smashed myself breathless {{against the wall of the}} chart-house. My ribs and one shoulder are sore from it yet. Now <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>know?</b> ...|$|E
60|$|Three weeks later, one morning, Steve and I were {{standing}} on the river-bank at Dawson. A small boat was just arriving from Lake Bennett. I saw Steve give a start, and heard him say something that was not nice and that was not under his breath. Then I looked; and there, in the bow of the boat, with ears pricked up, sat Spot. Steve and I sneaked immediately, like beaten curs, like cowards, like absconders from justice. It was this last that the lieutenant of police thought when he saw us sneaking. He surmised that there was law-officers in the boat who were after us. He didn't wait to find out, but kept us in sight, and in the M. & M. saloon got us in a corner. We had a merry time explaining, for we refused {{to go back to the}} boat and meet Spot; and finally he held us under guard of another policeman while he went to the boat. After we got clear of him, we started for the cabin, and when we arrived, there was that Spot sitting on the stoop waiting for us. Now <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> we lived there? There were forty thousand people in Dawson that summer, and how did he savve our cabin out of all the cabins? <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> we were in Dawson, anyway? I leave it to you. But don't forget what I have said about his intelligence and that immortal something I have seen glimmering in his eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Some trash {{about your}} being the great American beauty, {{with the most}} odious details, and your having made a match among the 'rare old exclusives.' And the strangest stuff about your father--his having gone into a 'store' {{at the age of}} twelve. And {{something}} about your poor sister--heaven help us! And a sketch of our career in Paris, as they call it, and the way we've pushed and got on and our ridiculous pretensions. And a passage about Blanche de Douves, Raoul's sister, who had that disease--what do they call it?--that she used to steal things in shops: do you see them reading THAT? And <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> such a thing? It's ages ago, it's dead and buried!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Here I {{looked at}} him sharply. I had told him nothing about Lady Ragnall having lost her wits. <b>How</b> then <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> of the matter? Still I thought it best to hold my peace. I think that Harût saw he had made some mistake, for leaving the subject of Lady Ragnall, he went on: ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{reports the}} American joke correctly. In Boston they ask, <b>How</b> much <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>know?</b> in New York, How much is he worth? in Philadelphia, Who were his parents? And when an alien {{observer}} turns his telescope upon us--advertisedly {{in our own}} special interest--a natural apprehension moves us to ask, What is the diameter of his reflector? ...|$|R
6000|$|MITCHENER. Your {{arguments}} are so devilishly ingenious that I feel convinced you got {{them out of}} some confounded book. Mine--such as they are--are my own. I imagine its something like this. There is an old saying {{that if you take}} care of the pence, the pounds will take care of themselves. Well, perhaps if we take care of the dowdies and the butchers and the bakers, the beauties and the bigwigs will take care of themselves. (Rising and facing her determinedly.) Anyhow, I dont want to have things arranged for me by Wagner. Im not Wagner. <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> where the shoe pinches me? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> you know where the shoe pinches your washerwoman?--you and your high F in alt. How are you to know when you havent made her comfortable unless she has a vote? Do you want her to come and break your windows? ...|$|R
