" His patient, though able to point out individual features of complex pictures, could not give an adequate account of the picture as a whole; though able to read isolated letters, she could only succeed in reading words by the expedient of spelling out each word letter by letter. Wolpert regarded this syndrome as based on a unitary disorder at the "highest level of perception " involving the "formation of the whole out of its parts, " but offered no experimental evidence in support of this view. In a controlled tachistoscopic study of 4 patients with defective picture interpretation and "spelling dyslexia, " Kinsbourne and Warrington (1962) demonstrated an underlying disorder of simultaneous visual form percep-tion. Visual forms were briefly exposed singly and in pairs.
