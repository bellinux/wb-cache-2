40|$|A {{cryogenic}} cam {{butterfly valve}} has {{a body that}} includes an axially extending fluid conduit formed there through. A disc lug is connected to a back side of a valve disc and has a circular bore that receives and is larger than a cam of a <b>cam</b> <b>shaft.</b> The valve disc is rotatable for a quarter turn within the body about a lug axis that is offset from the shaft axis. Actuating the <b>cam</b> <b>shaft</b> in the closing rotational direction first causes the camming side of the cam of the <b>cam</b> <b>shaft</b> to rotate the disc lug and the valve disc a quarter turn from the open position to the closed position. Further actuating causes the camming side of the <b>cam</b> <b>shaft</b> to translate the valve disc into sealed contact with the valve seat. Opening rotational direction of the <b>cam</b> <b>shaft</b> reverses these motions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRapid {{prototyping}} is {{a technique}} used to quickly fabricate an assembly, components or parts using three-dimensional Computer Aided Design and Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAD-CAM). It is an additive layer manufacturing technology. <b>Cam</b> <b>shaft</b> is a component in which a set of cams becomes an integral part to a shaft placed in its respective positions and directions according to {{the application of the}} particular <b>cam</b> <b>shaft.</b> These <b>cam</b> <b>shafts</b> are used in many industries especially in automobile, aerospace and marine industries. They are used in the engines of any automotive. In the engines these <b>cam</b> <b>shafts</b> are used for operating the inlet valves and outlet valves. These <b>cam</b> <b>shafts</b> are to be precisely manufactured {{in order to avoid the}} timing errors in opening and closing of the ports. So these camshafts are mostly machined and manufactured by computer operated machine systems. In these systems the various process of machining are listed and arranged in a specific order and connected to a computer. So the raw material undergoes several processes in several machines during the manufacture and finally the <b>cam</b> <b>shaft</b> is obtained. The main advantage of this type of manufacturing is that more number of precise components is obtained. Rapid prototyping process is one of the newly emerging manufacturing processes that could be used to manufacture <b>cam</b> <b>shaft</b> precisely. Rapid prototyping uses the process additive manufacturing in which the molten raw material is added layer by layer. The major problem in the rapid prototyping process is inability to use metals. But there are somematerials that possess the properties of metals and also have the ability to be used in rapid prototyping process. The material which is best suited for camshaft manufacturing using rapid prototyping was poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). Using this method of manufacturing process the space required and the cost required for manufacturing can be reduced. Performanceof the conventionally manufactured <b>cam</b> <b>shaft</b> and <b>cam</b> <b>shaft</b> manufactured by rapid prototyping can be compared and analysed...|$|R

40|$|A cassava stem {{cutting unit}} was {{developed}} to generate the design data for its use on a prototype of a cassava planter. It consisted of a 25. 5 cm circular saw blade, cam mechanism, bottom plate, electric motor (0. 75 kW) to operate saw blade and a motor (0. 37 kW). The cassava stems were fed manually into a feeding chute for free fall on to the bottom plate, and then these were cut by the circular saw operated by an electric motor. The cam mechanism operated by the cam motor, controlled the number of cuts by the circular saw. The cutting length could be adjusted between 15 and 30 cm by altering {{the position of the}} bottom plate. Test results indicated that the highest cutting quality of this unit at more than 60 number of circular saw teeth when operated at faster than 1, 200 rpm cutting shaft speed and slower than 50 rpm <b>cam</b> <b>shaft</b> speed. Cutting capacity depended on <b>cam</b> <b>shaft</b> speed.

40|$|A {{new type}} engine valve control {{system has been}} presented, in which both valve lift and phase are {{controlled}} directly by electric motors. A mechanism of the phase control system is made of planetary gears. The outer gear is the timing pulley which has timing belt driven by the crank of an engine. Two planetary gears are inside of the pulley. The gears engage in inner gear of the pulley. The center of the disc which has centers of the planetary gear {{is connected to the}} camshaft. Then, the crank rotation is transmitted to the <b>cam</b> <b>shaft,</b> and rotation of sun gear is added to the rotation of <b>cam</b> <b>shaft.</b> This means that when rotation angle of the sun gear is controlled, phase of the cam can be controlled. The lift control system is made of linear slider and ball screw. The cam shape of this system is three-dimensional. The height of the cam varies along the axis of the shaft. Hence, when the ball screw rotates, the <b>cam</b> <b>shaft</b> slides in the axial direction, so that the lift of the cam varies. Experimental tests have been carried out for the system. lt is ascertained that both cam lift and phase can be controlled continuously...|$|R

50|$|A cam and {{follower}} {{is formed}} by the direct contact of two specially shaped links. The driving link is called the cam (also see <b>cam</b> <b>shaft)</b> and the link that is driven through the direct contact of their surfaces is called the follower. The shape of the contacting surfaces of the {{cam and follower}} determines {{the movement of the}} mechanism. In general a cam follower mechanism's energy is transferred from cam to follower. The <b>cam</b> <b>shaft</b> is rotated and, according to the cam profile, the follower moves up and down. Now slightly different types of eccentric cam followers are also available in which energy is transferred from the follower to the cam.
