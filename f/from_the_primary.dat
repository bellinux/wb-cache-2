5|$|Some Russulaceae are {{associated}} with myco-heterotrophic plants of the Ericaceae subfamily Monotropoideae, forming monotropoid mycorrhiza. This is an epiparasitic relationship, where the heterotrophic plant ultimately derives its carbon <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary,</b> ectomycorrhizal plant partner of the fungus. The association is often very specific, with the heterotrophic plants only associating with selected fungus partners, including Russulaceae.|$|E

5|$|Bloodlines is {{presented}} from first- and third-person perspectives. The player assigns their character {{to one of}} several vampire clanseach with unique powers, customizes their combat and dialog abilities and progresses through Bloodlines using violent and nonviolent methods. The selection of clan affects how the player is perceived in the game world, and which powers and abilities they possess; this opens up different avenues of exploration and methods of interacting with or manipulating other characters. The player is able to complete side missions away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> storyline by moving freely between the available hubs: Santa Monica, Hollywood, downtown Los Angeles, and Chinatown.|$|E
5|$|Deus Exs {{gameplay}} combines {{elements of}} the first-person shooter with stealth elements, adventure, and role-playing genres, allowing for its tasks and missions {{to be completed in}} a variety of ways, that in turn lead to differing outcomes.

The player is able to complete side missions away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> storyline by moving freely around the available areas, which can reward the player with experience points to upgrade abilities and alternative ways to tackle main missions.|$|E

By season four, one reviewer said Lionel should have left the show after succumbing to his terminal liver disease in season three. Maurice Cobbs of DVD Verdict said Lionel was taking away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> characters' screen time in season four, and the producers should have killed him at the end of season three.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Amy and {{the clerics}} find the Angels moving away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> control room. One cleric goes to investigate, and finds the crack has grown wider, but then is soon {{consumed}} by it. Amy remembers this cleric, {{but none of}} the others do, as he had been erased from time. The crack continues to grow, and soon the other clerics are similarly consumed. The Doctor directs Amy to keep her eyes closed and work her way to the secondary control room, hoping that the Angels will not recognise that her eyes are shut. Amy falters and trips, but as the Angels move in, River is able to teleport her to the secondary control room, rescuing her.|$|E

5|$|The general {{principle}} behind {{the process of}} qiyas {{is based on the}} understanding that every legal injunction guarantees a beneficial and welfare satisfying objective. Thus, if the cause of an injunction can be deduced <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> sources, then analogical deduction can be applied to cases with similar causes. For example, wine is prohibited in Islam because of its intoxicating property. Thus qiyas leads to the conclusion that all intoxicants are forbidden.|$|E
5|$|The {{mayor is}} elected in citywide {{election}}. Elections follow a two-round system. The {{first round of}} the election is called the primary election.

Write-in candidates are only allowed to contest the primary election and are not allowed in the general election. The mayor is elected to a four-year term, with a limit of two consecutive terms.

5|$|The most {{prominent}} variable star in Auriga is Epsilon Aurigae (Al Maz, Almaaz), an F0 class {{eclipsing binary star}} with an unusually long period of 27 years; its last minima occurred in 1982–1984 and 2009–2011. The distance to the system is disputed, variously cited as 4600 and 2,170 light-years. The primary is a white supergiant, and the secondary may be itself a binary star within a large dusty disk. Its maximum magnitude is 3.0, but it stays at a minimum magnitude of 3.8 for around a year; its most recent eclipse began in 2009. The primary has an absolute magnitude of −8.5 and an unusually high luminosity of , the reason it appears so bright at such a great distance. Epsilon Aurigae is the longest-period eclipsing binary currently known. The first observed eclipse of Epsilon Aurigae occurred in 1821, though its variable status was not confirmed until the eclipse of 1847–48. From that time forward, many theories were put forth as {{to the nature of}} the eclipsing component. Epsilon Aurigae has a noneclipsing component, which is visible as a 14th magnitude companion separated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> by 28.6 arcseconds. It was discovered by Sherburne Wesley Burnham in 1891 at the Dearborn Observatory, and is about 0.5 light-years <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{radioisotope}} 16N is {{the dominant}} radionuclide in the coolant of pressurised water reactors or boiling water reactors during normal operation, and thus it is a sensitive and immediate indicator of leaks <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> coolant system to the secondary steam cycle, and is the primary means of detection for such leaks. It is produced from 16O (in water) via an (n,p) reaction in which the 16O atom captures a neutron and expels a proton. It has a short half-life of about 7.1 s, but during its decay back to 16O produces high-energy gamma radiation (5 to 7MeV). Because of this, access to the primary coolant piping in a pressurised water reactor must be restricted during reactor power operation.|$|E
5|$|Thomee (1986) mapped {{the habitat}} {{occupied}} by Novisuccinea chittenangoensis.

Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is found on a ledge beginning at 4m from the eastern edge of the Falls and extending to 16m from the Falls. In addition, Novisuccinea chittenangoensis can be found on the middle ledge 4m above the primary ledge and in the talus as far as 3m downslope <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> ledge.|$|E
