5|$|Aberdaron Beach is a surfing and bodyboarding {{location}} for surfers of all levels, {{although it can}} be dangerous at high tide when the waves break <b>directly</b> <b>onto</b> boulders underneath the cliff. The better surfers head for the northern end.|$|E
5|$|Because he was {{painting}} fresco, the plaster was laid {{in a new}} section every day, called a giornata. At {{the beginning of each}} session, the edges would be scraped away and a new area laid down. The edges between giornate remain slightly visible; thus, they give a good idea of how the work progressed. It was customary for fresco painters to use a full-sized detailed drawing, a cartoon, to transfer a design onto a plaster surface—many frescoes show little holes made with a stiletto, outlining the figures. Here Michelangelo broke with convention; once confident the intonaco had been well applied, he drew <b>directly</b> <b>onto</b> the ceiling. His energetic sweeping outlines can be seen scraped into some of the surfaces, while on others a grid is evident, indicating that he enlarged <b>directly</b> <b>onto</b> the ceiling from a small drawing.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's most {{controversial}} exhibition was entitled Chickenbones and Watermelon Seeds: The African American Experience as Abstract Art. The subject matter {{was a series}} of stereotypical African-American food culture items such as watermelon seeds, black-eyed peas, chicken bones, and cotton seeds placed <b>directly</b> <b>onto</b> photographic paper and exposed to light using an iron-reactive process.|$|E

5|$|Smart Studios had {{upgraded}} their {{mixing console}} to a Trident A-Range model, which the band used extensively. The band tracked <b>directly</b> <b>onto</b> analogue tape using a Studer tape machine, {{which was then}} dumped into Pro Tools digital audio workstation. Overdubs and mixing were carried out in Pro Tools.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the bridge}} is built on a gravel bed covered by {{shifting}} sand. The north end by the swing bridge section is next to the rock of Figle Fawr {{at the base of}} the Rhinogydd Range of mountains and the river channel here can flow up to 9 knots (16.7km/h). The first two spans here are built <b>directly</b> <b>onto</b> the rock.|$|E
5|$|On lap 22, Zorzi {{pulled off}} to {{the left side of the}} main straight, just after the brow of a hill and a bridge over the track. He was having {{problems}} with his fuel metering unit, and fuel was pumping <b>directly</b> <b>onto</b> the engine, which then caught fire. Zorzi did not immediately get out of his car as he could not disconnect the oxygen pipe from his helmet.|$|E

50|$|The {{village is}} unusual {{in that it is}} <b>directly</b> joined <b>onto</b> another village, Nawton, and is {{commonly}} given the name Nawton Beadlam. The village has a secondary school Ryedale School and Nawton, the village it is attached to, has a primary school, Nawton Primary School.|$|R
50|$|The game's playfield also {{features}} a spiral ramp, {{which serves as a}} skill shot from the plunger, and a bagatelle-style mini-playfield at the Solar Ramp exit, which can feed the ball to the right inlane, the plunger, the pop bumpers, or <b>directly</b> back <b>onto</b> the playfield.|$|R
5|$|After 400–500 {{accumulated}} degree-days above , adults {{begin to}} emerge from trees in late spring, and peak emergence occurs around 1000 degree-days. After emergence, adults feed for one week on ash leaves in the canopy before mating, but cause little defoliation in the process. Males hover around trees, locate females by visual cues, and drop <b>directly</b> <b>onto</b> the female to mate; mating can last 50 minutes, and females may mate with multiple males over their lifespan. A typical female can live around six weeks and lay approximately 40–70 eggs, but females that live longer can lay up to 200 eggs.|$|E
5|$|Historic and {{landmark}} presences {{are shown}} in the table below, which lists Chicago Landmarks, National Register of Historic Places locations, and National Historic Landmarks along The Magnificent Mile. At {{the northern edge of}} this district on the west, one finds the exclusive One Magnificent Mile building and Oak Street running to the west. Also, at the northern edge of the district one finds the Chicago Landmark East Lake Shore Drive District, an extremely expensive and exclusive one-block area of real estate running east from N. Michigan Ave. and facing <b>directly</b> <b>onto</b> Lake Michigan.|$|E
5|$|In 1913 the brothel was {{expanded}} again. A one-story structure {{was added to}} the building, increasing the number of cribs by eight; four of the added cribs opened <b>directly</b> <b>onto</b> Pleasant Alley, by that time known as Venus Alley. When copper prices went up, the more than 14,000 miners in the city experienced a pay-rise of twenty-five cents and injected an additional $6,000 into Butte's economy. The Dumas also experienced an upswing in patronage. As a result of the added patronage, the brothel added five partitions and a staircase in 1916, and the ground floor, once a grand parlor, was partitioned into cribs.|$|E
50|$|The hotel {{forms the}} front of the Glasgow Central railway station on Gordon Street, <b>directly</b> {{adjoining}} <b>onto</b> the station concourse. It was one of Glasgow's most prestigious hotels in its heyday, hosting residents as famous as Frank Sinatra, Big Atanu, Wee Barry Wyllie and Winston Churchill.|$|R
40|$|A novel apex-modified cyclotriveratrylene (CTV) {{derivative}} with an attached thiolane-containing lipoic acid linker was <b>directly</b> patterned <b>onto</b> gold substrates via dip-pen nanolithography (DPN). The {{addition of}} a dithiolane-containing linker to the apex of CTV provides a molecule that can adhere to a gold surface with its bowl-shaped cavity directed away from the surface, thereby providing a surface-bound CTV host {{that can be used}} for the directed assembly of guest molecules. Subsequent exposure of these CTV microarrays to C 60 in toluene resulted in the directed assembly of predesigned, spatially controlled, high-density microarrays of C 60. The molecular recognition capabilities of this CTV template toward C 60 provides proof-of-concept that supramolecular CTV scaffolds can be <b>directly</b> patterned <b>onto</b> surfaces providing a foundation for the development of organic electronic and optoelectronic materials...|$|R
50|$|The {{inscription}} is on a thin {{copper plate}} measuring less than 20 × 30 cm (8 × 12 inches) in size with words <b>directly</b> embossed <b>onto</b> the plate. It differs in manufacture from Javanese scrolls of the period, {{which had the}} words inscribed onto a heated, softened scroll of metal.|$|R
5|$|In {{the male}} frog, the two testes are {{attached}} to the kidneys and semen passes into the kidneys through fine tubes called efferent ducts. It then travels on through the ureters, which are consequently known as urinogenital ducts. There is no penis, and sperm is ejected from the cloaca <b>directly</b> <b>onto</b> the eggs as the female lays them. The ovaries of the female frog are beside the kidneys and the eggs pass down a pair of oviducts and through the cloaca to the exterior.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{instances}} include removing {{of parts}} from the mould {{immediately after the}} parts are created, as well as applying machine vision systems. A robot grips the part after the ejector pins have been extended to free the part from the mould. It then moves them into either a holding location or <b>directly</b> <b>onto</b> an inspection system. The choice depends upon the type of product, {{as well as the}} general layout of the manufacturing equipment. Vision systems mounted on robots have greatly enhanced quality control for insert moulded parts. A mobile robot can more precisely determine the placement accuracy of the metal component, and inspect faster than a human can.|$|E
5|$|The public façade of {{the palace}} faces <b>directly</b> <b>onto</b> a town square and {{takes the form of}} two low, symmetrical, {{quadrant}} wings which flank the forward-reaching wings of a small central corps de logis, thus forming a semi-circular cour d'honneur (see key 1). The southern of the two quadrant wings is terminated by the onion-domed chapel, while the northern wing contained the kitchens and servants' quarters (see keys 2, 1 and 13). The only decoration comes from the simple classical pediments above the windows. This façade, that most readily seen from the town, presents a decorous and impassive public face {{with one of the most}} architecturally severe elevations {{of the palace}} (see illustration right).|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} other Black Paintings, Goya began with a black {{background}} which he painted over with lighter pigments, then with broad, heavy brushstrokes of grey, blue and brown. The darker areas were achieved by leaving the black under-paint exposed; this is most obvious in {{the figure of the}} Devil. Like the other works in the series, Witches' Sabbath is worked up through heavy, slashing brushstrokes. The plaster was underlaid with thick carbon black before the paint was applied in hues of white lead, Prussian blue, vermilion of mercury, and crystals of powdered glass, orpiment and iron oxides. He likely worked with mixed materials. Technical analysis indicates that most of the Black Paintings begun with preparatory drawings. Witches' Sabbath is the exception; the final composition seems to have been painted <b>directly</b> <b>onto</b> the wall.|$|E
5|$|Because sea {{conditions}} were so rough, {{the decision was}} made for the 116th RCT to carry the DD tanks of the 743rd tank battalion {{all the way to the}} beach, after 27 of the initial 29 DD tanks of the 741st tank battalion swamped while wading to shore. Coming in opposite the heavily defended Vierville draw, Company B of the 743rd Tank Battalion lost all but one of its officers and half of its DD tanks. The other two companies landed to the left of B/743 without initial loss. On the 16th RCT front, the two DD tanks from the 741st tank battalion that had survived the swim ashore were joined by three others that were landed <b>directly</b> <b>onto</b> the beach because of their LCT's damaged ramp. The remaining tank company managed to land 14 of its 16 tanks (although three of these were quickly knocked out).|$|E
5|$|Mad Max is a post-apocalyptic action-adventure game {{emphasizing}} vehicular combat, {{in which}} the player is the eponymous Mad Max (Bren Foster). According to its publisher, up to 60 percent of the game focuses on driving. Some weapons and tools, including flamethrowers and turbo boosts, are mounted <b>directly</b> <b>onto</b> the Magnum Opus, while others, such as a grappling hook and sniper rifle, are {{used in conjunction with}} the vehicle by Chumbucket, Max's assistant, or Max himself. Max's Magnum Opus, with its V8 engine and powerful ramming ability, can destroy enemies' vehicles and weaponry. When simultaneously driving and aiming, the game changes to slow motion to allow the player to toggle between targets. Although Mad Max primarily uses a third-person perspective, the player can switch to first-person view when fighting enemies while driving the Magnum Opus. Chumbucket repairs the car when instructed to do so or when the player exits.|$|E
50|$|The {{flowers of}} this species hardly open, because they are autogamous (self-pollinating). Before anthesis, {{the opening of the}} flower, the anther opens and the pollinia <b>directly</b> sink <b>onto</b> the stigmatic surface. Then pollen tubes start growing. This {{pollination}} mode enables the White helleborine to grow in deep shade, where the pollinators are almost absent.|$|R
50|$|The engine, {{although}} well developed, {{suffered from}} secondary vibration. This was minimal in the three-cylinder K100 derived K75, and minimised in the K100 through introduction of well designed vibration suppression. On the sporting inspired K1, {{the engine was}} <b>directly</b> mounted <b>onto</b> the frame, which led to secondary vibrations problems at certain mid-range engine revolutions.|$|R

5|$|Magnetic Airborne Detection (MAD) {{was used}} to detect {{submerged}} U-boats. It consisted of a sensitive magnetometer installed in the cone of the aircraft (mostly Catalinas) that could detect anomalies in the Earth's magnetic field within a range of 400 feet and was sensitive to detect a submarine to within a few feet. The mine was {{used in conjunction with}} a 65.5lb retro bomb. It was filled with 25lb of Torpex and the weapon was rocket propelled backwards to the line of flight at a speed that counteracted the aircraft's forward motion. It was released rearwards from rails on the wings of the aircraft. Thus, with the aircraft's forward motion cancelled-out by the rocket motor, the device fell <b>directly</b> <b>onto</b> the target.|$|E
5|$|The pitch has two ends, the Pavilion End and Media Centre End. The Media Centre End {{was renamed}} in 2011 to the Willie Rodriguez End {{in honour of}} the former Queen's Park and Trinidad and Tobago player. Natural turf {{was used in the}} early years however Mole crickets caused too much damage on the {{original}} pitch which was laid <b>directly</b> <b>onto</b> the natural soil, so soon after the ground was purchased a pitch of clay was laid over a wicket made of coir matting. A 1932 study into cricket pitches ruled that clay pitches lacking in calcium carbonate were ideal for cricket play. However, the Queen's Park Oval clay surface was disproportionately suited to batting. A score of 681/8d in 1954, and double-centuries by Everton Weekes in consecutive series during that same year, prompted the laying of a turf wicket in 1955 in an attempt to balance batting and bowling. Five 20-metre-wide and 26-metre-long pitches were dug, each with a depth of one meter.|$|E
5|$|While RR Telescopii, also {{designated}} Nova Telescopii 1948, {{is often}} called a slow nova, it is now classified as a symbiotic nova system composed of an M5III pulsating red giant and a white dwarf; between 1944 and 1948 it brightened by about 7 magnitudes before being noticed at apparent magnitude 6.0 in mid-1948. It has since faded slowly to about apparent magnitude 12. QS Telescopii is a binary system composed of a white dwarf and main sequence donor star, {{in this case the}} two are close enough to be tidally locked, facing one another. Known as polars, material from the donor star does not form an accretion disk around the white dwarf, but rather streams <b>directly</b> <b>onto</b> it. This is due to the presence of the white dwarf's strong magnetic field.|$|E
