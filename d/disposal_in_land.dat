After defuelling, U.S. practice is to cut the reactor section from the vessel for <b>disposal</b> <b>in</b> shallow <b>land</b> burial as low-level waste (see the ship-submarine recycling program). In Russia, whole vessels, or sealed reactor sections, typically remain stored afloat, although a new facility near Sayda Bay is to provide storage in a concrete-floored facility on land for some submarines in the far north.|$|R
50|$|Several {{terms are}} used to {{describe}} this waste management approach, which can be considered both treatment and <b>disposal.</b> <b>In</b> general, <b>land</b> farming refers to the repeated application of wastes to the soil surface, whereas land spreading and land treatment are often used interchangeably to describe the one-time application of wastes to the soil surface. Some practitioners do not follow the same terminology convention, and may interchange all three terms.

40|$|Hazardous, wastes are common, {{generated}} in large volumes, and pres- ent modes of management are not sufficient. Hazardous wastes are generated by driving a vehicle and {{the manufacture of}} cosmetics, food, and vehicles, and so forth. Seven major federal regulations control, limit, and manage hazardous wastes. Public perceptions of the issues regarding hazardous substances management are clouded due {{to the absence of}} standards for determining acceptable risks, and because it is difficult to distinguish between toxic and hazardous materials. Current technologies used to manage hazardous wastes include incineration, use as fuel, solidification and stabilization, solvent and metal recovery, wastewater treatment, <b>disposal</b> <b>in</b> landfills, <b>land</b> treatment, underground injection, and waste minimi- zation and recycling. Effective public policy and practice only will evolve when there is {{a better understanding of the}} problems, development of acceptable public health risk standards and streamlined processes for approval of new facilities, and appropriate incentives for reducing the annual volume of hazardous wastes...|$|R
50|$|The Bowes River is a {{river in}} the Mid West of Western Australia. It was named on 6 April 1839 by the {{explorer}} George Grey while on his second exploration expedition along the Western Australian coast. It was named for Mary Bowes, Dowager Countess of Strathmore, the wife of Sir William Hutt. Hutt was a British Liberal politician who was heavily involved in the colonization of New Zealand and South Australia, and the brother of John Hutt, the second governor of Western Australia. Sir William Hutt {{was a member of}} the 1836 select committee on <b>Disposal</b> of <b>Lands</b> <b>in</b> the British Colonies. Grey named the nearby Hutt River after Hutt.|$|R

40|$|UNESCO {{will open}} a centre for {{research}} {{on the problems of}} water resources in Latin America and the Caribbean in Panama City, {{as a result of an}} agreement signed on 13 November, 1992 in Paris. It will be called CATHALAC (Centro del Agua del Tropico Humedo de America Latina y el Caribo) and will act under the aegis of UNESCO's International Hydrological Progamme (IHP), in order to promote research on hydrology in the region's tropical wet zones. It might seem a paradox to spend time and money on water management in 'wet' zones, but this designation contains some extremely marked variations in annual rainfall, rain falls copiously for a short period and is followed by months of scorching heat. The Centre will address the many problems of water management which are common to the countries of this region: deforestation water pollution, erosion etc. It will also work with the Caribbean region, which has to contend with the specific hydrological problems which affect islands: infiltration of seawater, water shortage sewage <b>disposal</b> <b>in</b> small <b>land</b> masses, degradation of the shoreline, etc. Mike Bonell UNESCO/lnternational Hydrological Programme 1 rue Miollis, 75732 Paris cedex 15, FRANCEUNESCO {{will open a}} centre for research on the problems of water resources in Latin America and the Caribbean in Panama City, as a result of an agreement signed on 13 November, 1992 in Paris.

Ward chaired the 1836 select committee on <b>Disposal</b> of <b>Lands</b> <b>in</b> the British Colonies.

40|$|Energy {{recovery}} {{potential of}} a mesophilic co-digester treating OFMSW and primary sludge at an integrated biomethanization plant was investigated based on feasibility study results. Since landfilling is still the main solid waste <b>disposal</b> method <b>in</b> Turkey, <b>land</b> scarcity will {{become one of the}} most important obstacles. Restrictions for biodegradable waste disposal to sanitary landfills in EU Landfill Directive and uncontrolled long-term contamination with gas emissions and leachate necessitate alternative management strategies due to rapid increase in MSW production. Moreover, since energy contribution from renewable resources will be required more in the future with increasing oil prices and dwindling supplies of conventional energy sources, the significance of biogas as a renewable fuel has been increased in the last decade. Results indicated that almost 93 % of annual total cost can be recovered if 100 % renewable energy subsidy is implemented. Besides, considering the potential revenue when replacing transport fuels, about 26 heavy good vehicles or 549 cars may be powered per year by the biogas produced from the proposed biomethanization plant (PE = 100, 000; XPS = 61 [*]g TS/PE⋅day; XSS-OFMSW= 50 [*]g TS/PE⋅day) ...|$|R

40|$|Routine manufacture, {{detonation}} and <b>disposal</b> {{of explosives}} <b>in</b> <b>land</b> and groundwater {{have resulted in}} complete pollution. Explosives are xenobiotic compounds, being toxic to biological systems, and their recalcitrance leads to persistence in the environment. The methods currently used for the remediation of explosive contaminated sites are expensive and can result {{in the formation of}} toxic products. The present study aimed to investigate the bacterial strains using the Biolog plates in the soil from the Riyadh community. The microbial strains were isolated using the spread plate technique and were identified using the Biolog method. In this study we have analyzed from bacterial families of soil samples, obtained from the different sites in 5 regions at Explosive Institute. Our results conclude that Biolog MicroPlates were developed for the rapid identification of bacterial isolates by sole-carbon source utilization and can be used for the identification of bacteria. Out of five communities, only four families of bacteria indicate that the microbial community lacks significant diversity in region one from the Riyadh community in Saudi Arabia. More studies are needed to be carried out in different regions to validate our results...|$|R
