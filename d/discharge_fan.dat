In Iran, rice (mostly Indica type) is dried by flat bed type dryer until the final MC reaches to 6 to 8 %. The experiments were conducted to {{examine the effect of}} application of <b>discharge</b> <b>fan</b> with different heights of paddy on the drying efficiency. Experiments were designed based on two different configurations of the drying methods; with and without <b>discharge</b> <b>fan</b> with three different heights of paddy including; 5, 10, and 15 cm. The humid heated air will be going out immediately by the suction of <b>discharge</b> <b>fan.</b> The drying time is established upon the average final MC to achieve about 8 %. To save energy and reduce the drying time, the distribution of temperature between layers should be fast and uniform with minimum difference; otherwise the difference of MC gradient between layers will be high and will induce grain breakage. The difference of final MC between layers in the two methods was 48 - 73 %. The steady state of temperature between the two methods has saved time in the range of 10 - 20 %, and the efficiency of temperature distribution increased 17 - 26 % by the use of <b>discharge</b> <b>fan.</b> ...|$|E

5000|$|Specific thrust (net thrust/intake airflow) is an {{important}} parameter for turbofans and jet engines in general. Imagine a fan (driven by an appropriately sized electric motor) operating within a pipe, which is connected to a propelling nozzle. It is fairly obvious, the higher the fan pressure ratio (<b>fan</b> <b>discharge</b> pressure/fan inlet pressure), the higher the jet velocity and the corresponding specific thrust. Now imagine we replace this set-up with an equivalent turbofan - same airflow and same fan pressure ratio. Obviously, {{the core of the}} turbofan must produce sufficient power to drive the fan via the low-pressure (LP) turbine. If we choose a low (HP) turbine inlet temperature for the gas generator, the core airflow needs to be relatively high to compensate. The corresponding bypass ratio is therefore relatively low. If we raise the turbine inlet temperature, the core airflow can be smaller, thus increasing bypass ratio. Raising turbine inlet temperature tends to increase thermal efficiency and, therefore, improve fuel efficiency.|$|R
40|$|Dimensional {{restrictions}} in electronic equipment {{have resulted in}} miniaturisation of many existing cooling technologies. In addition, cooling solutions are required to dissipate increased thermal loads to maintain component reliability and user comfort. Fans are widely used in electronics cooling to meet such thermal demands, either in standalone for direct component cooling, or in combination with a heat sink. The thermal performance of such designs when scaled to dimensions suitable for use in portable electronics has received limited attention, mainly due to the reliance on passive cooling methodologies currently employed. However, as heat flux increases, passive cooling is reaching its limit and other solutions will be required. This thesis aims {{to address this issue}} by experimentally examining the fluid dynamics and thermal performance of forced convection cooling solutions with dimensional constraints. Conventional finned and novel finless heat sink designs have been integrated with commercially available radial blowers to investigate cooling solutions with overall foot print areas as low as 487 mm 2, and profile heights less than 5 mm. The novel finless geometry, with reduced manufacturing cost, energy consumption and weight promoted heat transfer above that of the same size classical finned designs for a range of operating points. Both geometries showed increases of up to 20 % in thermal performance by aligning the fan exit flow with the heat sink channels, hence demonstrating the need for integrated fan and heat sink design of low profile applications. Optimisation and geometry selection criteria were determined by scaling profile height for both heat sink designs from 4 mm to 1 mm. Theoretical predictions under estimated the finless design thermal performance, which was found to scale towards that of a turbulent flow regime despite the low Reynolds number. The mechanisms of this improvement in heat flux was investigated and unique, heat transfer enhancing, features in the finless design were identified. A combined infrared thermography and heated-thin-foil technique was developed for miniature fan applications, to accurately determine local heat transfer coe cients due to radial and axial fan flows. This highlighted the non-uniform heat transfer rates produced by the three-dimensional air patterns from rotating fans, and {{has been shown to be}} an important consideration in the design stages for component cooling. For the same chip temperature, strategic positioning of electronic components resulted in up to three-fold gains in power dissipation for direct component cooling applications. Local peaks in heat transfer coe cient when using axial fan impingement were directly related to the air flow and fan motor support interaction. It was found that for optimum thermal performance, motor support dimensions should be kept to a minimum and positioned on the inlet flow plane, the opposite to the current industrial practice. Flow structures and surface heat transfer trends due to radial fan flows were found to be common over a wide range of fan aspect ratios (blade height to fan diameter). The limiting aspect ratio for heat transfer enhancement was 0. 3, as larger aspect ratios were shown to result in a reduction in overall thermal performance. Results also indicate that low profile radial fan designs are not just limited to portable devices, but may also be a practical solution to thermal management issues in larger scale electronics. A practical operating condition was represented by the introduction of a uniform crossing air flow above a radial fan inlet and indirectly reduced surface heat transfer. A distorted inflow shifted the surface heat transfer distribution from an axisymmetric to asymmetric profile for a radially <b>discharging</b> <b>fan</b> design. Overall, the findings presented in this thesis are fundamentally and practically useful for the design of forced convection cooling solutions using rotating fans in space restricted applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{stratigraphy}} of rift basins is {{a direct}} result of sediment liberation and transport through catchment–fan systems whose dynamics are controlled by both external and internal factors. We investigate the response of catchment–fan systems established across an active normal fault to variations in both tectonic and climatic boundary conditions. Numerical experiments show that the ratio of fan area to catchment area provides a sensitive indicator of tectonic activity. A step decrease in fault slip rate results in a delayed response by the catchment–fan systems; the response time is ∼ 50 kyr for a variety of parameter values. Decreased slip rate also gives rise to an abrupt but transient pulse in sediment <b>discharge</b> from the <b>fans</b> due to a drop in the hangingwall subsidence rate. In contrast, variations in climatic activity, using precipitation rate as a proxy, produce extremely rapid responses throughout the catchment–fan system. Thus, high-frequency climatic changes will overprint lower frequency tectonic variations in the stratigraphic record of fan deposits. Finally, we map out possible combinations of fault geometry, fault slip rate and precipitation rate that allow fan progradation and high rates of sediment discharge from the system...|$|R
40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols on renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. Alluvial fans were {{studied in the}} field, largely in the desert regions of California, and in the laboratory. Field study consisted of detailed mapping of ages and sizes of debris, channel patterns, and deposits of different types on parts of four fans, and reconnaissance work on over 100 additional fans. Reconnaissance generally consisted of outlining the fan, noting material size and channel patterns, and measuring a few slopes. In the laboratory small alluvial fans were built of mud and sand transported through a channel into a five-foot square box under controlled conditions. Material is transported to fans by debris flows or water flows which follow the main channel. This channel is generally incised at the fanhead, because there water is able to transport on a lower slope the material deposited earlier by debris flows. Since the main channel at the fanhead has a lower slope than the adjacent fan surface, it emerges onto the surface near a midfan point herein called the intersection point. On the laboratory fans most deposition above the intersection point is by debris flows that exceed {{the depth of the}} incised channel. Fluvial deposition dominates below the intersection point. This is also inferred to be true on natural fans. Fans deficient in fine material may have so high an infiltration rate that even moderately large discharges are completely absorbed before reaching the toe of the fan. Under these conditions the coarse debris in transport is deposited as lobate masses on the fan. In many respects these deposits resemble and may, in the past, have been mistaken for debris-flow deposits. The empirical relationship between fan area, A[subscript f], and drainage-basin area, A[subscript d] = cA[subscript d][superscript n] has been recognized previously (Bull, 1964; Denny, 1965). The present study suggests that this relationship results from a tendency toward a quasi steady-state between coalescing fans in the same lithologic, tectonic, and geographic environment. The quasi steady-state exists when all fans are increasing in thickness at the same rate. If rates differ, the areas of the fans will change to approach a quasi steady-state. The rate of deposition is determined by the influx of debris, which is a function of drainage basin area. The exponent [ [...] . ] is less than unity because a storm of a given recurrence interval is less likely to envelop a large drainage basin than a small one. The coefficient [ [...] . ] {{is a function of the}} lithologic, tectonic, and geographic environment. Rates of deposition on fans may be estimated from this relationship using Langbein and Schumm's (1958) data on sediment yield as a function of precipitation. A typical average rate is on the order of one foot per 1, 000 years. If a long-term tectonic process is superimposed upon the quasi steady-state relationship between fans in the same lithologic and geographic environment, the rate of deposition may be used to estimate the rate and nature of the tectonic process. As an example, the difference in depositional rates on opposite sides of Death Valley suggests a present rate of eastward tilting of 0. 018 degrees/ 1000 years. The slope of an alluvial fan is determined primarily by debris size and water <b>discharge.</b> Large <b>fans</b> have larger drainage basins and hence larger <b>discharges</b> than small <b>fans.</b> Consequently fan slope generally decreases with increasing fan area.

Five airflow estimation methods were studied. The Reference Method was a fan corrected airflow to fan corrected speed calibration from an uninstalled engine test. In-flight airflow estimation methods utilized the average, or individual, inlet duct static- to total-pressure ratios, and the average fan-discharge static-pressure to average inlet total-pressure ratio. Correlations were established at low distortion conditions for each method relative to the Reference Method. A range of distorted inlet flow conditions were obtained from - 10 deg. to + 60 deg. angle of attack and - 7 deg. to + 11 deg. angle of sideslip. The individual inlet duct pressure ratio correlation resulted in a 2. 3 percent airflow spread for all distorted flow levels with a bias error of - 0. 7 percent.

The qualification criteria for these types of stacks address 1) uniformity of air velocity, 2) sufficiently small flow angle with respect to the axis of the duct, 3) uniformity of tracer gas concentration, and 4) uniformity of tracer particle concentration. Testing was performed to conform to the quality requirements of NQA- 1 - 2000. Fan configurations tested included all fan combinations of any two fans at a time. Most of the tests were conducted at the normal flow rate, while a small subset of tests was performed at a slightly higher flow rate achieved with the laboratory hood sashes fully open. The qualification criteria for an air monitoring probe location are taken from ANSI/HPS N 13. 1 - 2011 and are paraphrased as follows with key results summarized: 1. Angular Flow—The average air velocity angle must not deviate from the axis of the stack or duct by more than 20 °. Our test results show that the mean angular flow angles at the center two-thirds of the ducts are smaller than 4. 5  for all testing conditions. 2. Uniform Air Velocity—The acceptance criterion is that the COV of the air velocity must be ≤ 20 % across the center two thirds of the area of the stack. Our results show that the COVs of the air velocity across the center two-thirds of the stack are smaller than 2. 9 % for all testing conditions. 3. Uniform Concentration of Tracer Gases—The uniformity of the concentration of potential contaminants is first tested using a tracer gas to represent gaseous effluents. The tracer is injected downstream of the fan outlets and at the junction downstream <b>fan</b> <b>discharges</b> meet. The acceptance criteria are that 1) the COV of the measured tracer gas concentration is ≤ 20 % across the center two-thirds of the sampling plane and 2) at no point in the sampling plane does the concentration vary from the mean by > 30 %. Our test results show that 1) the COV of the measured tracer gas concentration is 6. 5 %. 4. Uniform Concentration of Tracer Particles—Tracer particles of 10 -μm aerodynamic diameter are used for the second demonstration of concentration uniformity. The acceptance criterion is that the COV of particle concentration is ≤ 20 % across the center two thirds of the sampling plane. Our test results indicate that the COV of particle concentration is < 9. 9 % across the center two-thirds of the sampling plane among all testing conditions. Thus, the reconfigured 3410 Building Filtered Exhaust Stack was determined to meet the qualification criteria given in the ANSI/HPS N 13. 1 - 2011 standard. Changes to the system configuration or operations outside the bounds described in this report (e. g., exhaust stack velocity changes, relocation of sampling probe, and addition of fans) may require re-testing or re-evaluation to determine compliance...|$|R
