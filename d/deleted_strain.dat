A281 was genetically engineered through a double crossover, site-directed deletion to yield EHA101, a T-DNA <b>deleted</b> <b>strain</b> useful for target gene transfer into plants. EHA101 is resistant to kanamycin by way of an npt I gene in place of T-DNA. The parent strain, A281, does not show antibiotic resistances at higher levels than normal A. tumefaciens strains. Moreover, other transconjugant strains in the C58C1 background, do not show these increased resistances to antibiotics. Therefore, these characteristics are not simply {{a manifestation of the}} chromosomal background, but most likely an interaction of this Ti plasmid and the C58 chromosomal background.|$|E

Haploid strains with a disrupted allele were able to grow on fatty acids. The levels of acyl-CoA oxidase activity in the ACO 3 <b>deleted</b> <b>strain,</b> in an ACO 1 <b>deleted</b> <b>strain</b> and in the wild-type strain, suggested that ACO 3 encodes a short chain acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzyme.

Microsomal preparation from the <b>deleted</b> <b>strain</b> only slightly reacted to the additional exogenous FPP, while that from the wild-type strain presented a 4 -fold increase of polyprenol synthesis. Restoration of ergosterol synthesis, by introducing ERG 9 functional allele into the <b>deleted</b> <b>strain</b> resulted in a significant lowering of polyprenol synthesis, indicating the immediate shift of the common substrate (FPP) to the sterol pathway.

The aim of the B 1 Consortium of the EUROFAN project was to perform a qualitative phenotypic analysis on yeast <b>strains</b> <b>deleted</b> for functionally orphan genes. To this end we set up a simple approach to detect growth defects of a relatively large number of strains in the presence of osmolytes, ethanol, high temperature, inhibitory compounds or drugs affecting protein biosynthesis, phosphorylation level or nucleic acids biosynthesis. We have now developed this procedure to a semi-quantitative level, we have included new inhibitors, such as hygromycin B, benomyl, metals and additional drugs interfering with synthesis of nucleic acids, and we have performed phenotypic analysis on the <b>deleted</b> <b>strains</b> of 564 genes poorly characterized in respect to their cellular functions. About 30 % of the <b>deleted</b> <b>strains</b> showed at least one phenotype: many of them were pleiotropic.

40|$|Catabolite {{repression}} (CCR) regulates {{amino acid}} permeases in Saccharomyces cerevisiae via a TOR-kinase mediated mechanism. When glucose, the preferred fuel in S. cerevisiae, is substituted by galactose, amino acid uptake is increased. Here we have assessed the contribution and metabolic {{significance of this}} surfeit of amino acid in yeast undergoing catabolite derepression (CDR). L-[U- 14 C]leucine oxidation was increased 15 ± 1 fold in wild type (WT) strain grown in galactose compared to glucose. Under CDR, leucine oxidation was (i) proportional to uptake, as demonstrated by decreased uptake and oxidation of leucine in <b>strains</b> <b>deleted</b> of major leucine permeases and (ii) entirely dependent upon the TCA cycle, as cytochrome c 1 (Cyt 1) <b>deleted</b> <b>strains</b> could not grow in galactose. A regulator of amino acid carbon entry into the TCA cycle, branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase, was also increased 29 ± 3 fold under CCR in WT strain. Protein expression of key TCA cycle enzymes, citrate synthase (Cs), and Cyt 1 was increased during CDR. In summary, CDR upregulation of amino acid uptake is accompanied by increased utilization of amino acids for yeast growth. The mechanism for {{this is likely to}} be an increase in protein expression of key regulators of the TCA cycle...|$|R
40|$|Ribosomal RNAs (rRNA) undergo several post-transcriptional {{modifications}} {{inside the}} cell. These modifications can be (1) RNA- independent (enzyme only) and (2) guide RNA-mediated. In the latter mechanism, {{a group of}} small, metabolically stable, non-coding RNAs, present as ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles, modify ribosomal RNAs inside the cell. One of the highly abundant rRNA modifications is pseudouridine (Y) formation. In Archaea and Eukarya, pseudouridine synthases, {{with the help of}} small RNAs, form pseudouridines at functionally important regions in rRNA. Cbf 5, the pseudouridine synthase, three other core proteins, and a box H/ACA RNA form the ribonucleoprotein complex in sRNP-mediated rRNA pseudouridylation. Certain Ys in rRNAs are evolutionarily conserved from Bacteria to human. Among those, two Ys are present in helix 69 of rRNA and one in helix 90. We successfully deleted Cbf 5 in Haloferax volcanii, a haloarchaeon, and showed that the <b>deleted</b> <b>strain</b> was viable. It was the first report where Cbf 5 deletion was achieved, because deletion or mutation of cbf 5 or of its homologs is lethal in eukaryotes. We also found that the cbf 5 <b>deleted</b> <b>strain</b> was unable to produce the three highly conserved Ys in rRNA of H. volcanii (position 1940, 1942 in helix 69, and 2605 in helix 90), whereas the tRNA Ys were intact. To identify the specific structural features of Cbf 5 involved in rRNA Ψ formation, we used a cbf 5 <b>deleted</b> <b>strain</b> which was complemented with a plasmid borne copy of the gene. Using the crystal structure of Pyrococcous furiosus Cbf 5 as template, we created a homology model of H. volcanii Cbf 5 (HvCbf 5) and identified several residues and motifs/domains of HvCbf 5 that might be important to the protein 2 ̆ 7 s enzymatic activity. By using an in vivo mutational approach, we confirmed some previously predicted and certain unidentified residues/motifs/domains that serve as positive determinants of rRNA Ys 1940, 1942, and 2605 formation inside the cell. A box H/ACA RNA, sR-h 45, was bioinformatically predicted before. We confirmed its presence as a double hairpin RNA inside the cell whose level goes down in the absence of Cbf 5. We identified that sR-h 45 is the guide RNA for sRNP-mediated Ys at the three above mentioned rRNA positions in H. volcanii. Each hairpin of this RNA can independently modify the substrate, both in vivo and in vitro. To characterize the structure of sR-h 45, we have used a sR-h 45 <b>deleted</b> <b>strain</b> where the function of sR-h 45 was complemented with a plasmid-borne copy of the gene. By a combination of in vivo and in vitro mutagenic approaches, we determined specific nucleotides/structures of this RNA, involved in binding to the core proteins and also to the substrate RNA. We also identified that one hairpin of sR-h 45 can modify two successive positions (1940 and 1942) in rRNA...|$|E
40|$|We {{and others}} (Maidan, et al., 2005; Miwa, et al., 2004) {{previously}} identified the putative G-protein coupled receptor Gpr 1 in Candida albicans. The {{interaction between the}} G-protein Gpa 2 and Gpr 1 was clearly established by two-hybrid experiment, and the overactivation of Gpa 2 (Gpa 2 Q 354 L) does rescue wild type phenotypes in a gpr 1 <b>deleted</b> <b>strain.</b> However, neither deletion of Gpa 2 or Gpr 1 lead to reduced PKA activity. For instance, cAMP induction in response to glucose addition to deprived cells seems independent of the GPCR complex. Similarly, trehalose mobilisation after addition of glucose (downstream process resulting from PKA activation) is not impaired in both mutants. The Gpr 1 ligand remains to be identified. Internalisation of Gpr 1 -GFP fusion in C. albicans is induced by amino acids rather than by glucose, and yet cAMP induction by amino acids is not clearly established, nor it differs between a wild type strain and a gpr 1 <b>deleted</b> <b>strain.</b> Gpr 1 putatively transmits nutrient-availability signals to other cascades. We therefore aim to identify downstream targets of Gpr 1 signalling. The signalling through PKA and the activation of Gpr 1 by its ligand may not systematically linked.

40|$|Signal {{transduction}} in the archaeon Halobacterium salinarum {{is mediated}} by thirteen soluble and membrane-bound transducers. Phototaxis in H. salinarum is processed via two signaling complexes: sensory rhodopsin I photoreceptor-Htrl phototransducer (SRI­ Htrl) and sensory rhodopsin II photoreceptor-Htrll phototransducer (SRll-Htrll). Unlike the Htrl phototransducer, the Htrll phototransducer contains a large periplasmic domain-a classic feature of bacterial chemotransducers. Thus {{the existence of}} a periplasmic domain in the Htrll phototransducer suggests that Htrll is not only involved in phototaxis, but also in chemotaxis. To test this hypothesis, we developed an agarose-in­ plug bridge assay to study chemotaxis in H. salinarum by detecting the density of cells around a solidified agarose plug containing chemoeffectors. The role of Htrll as a chemotransducer was studied by using this assay with overexpressed and <b>deleted</b> Htrll <b>strains</b> to all essential amino acids.

As a selection/counter-selection marker we used the gene coding for the orotidine- 5 -phosphate decarboxylase (Boeke et al. 1984) (pyrG, from Aspergillus oryzae). After transformation of A. niger, cells were selected for uridine prototrophy, confirming integration of the plasmid into the chromosome. After purification of the transformants, release of the selective pressure for the integrated plasmid was achieved by propagating the clones twice on potato dextrose agar containing 10  mM uridine. Selection for cells that had excised the plasmid from the chromosome was done by plating them on media containing 4  mM of 5 -fluoro-orotic acid (Melford, Ipswich, UK) and 1.6  mM uridine.

40|$|Cyprinid {{herpesvirus}} 3 (CyHV- 3), {{a member}} of the family Alloherpesviridae, is the causative agent of a lethal disease in common and koi carp. CyHV- 3 ORF 134 encodes an interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) homologue. The present study was devoted to this ORF. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that ORF 134 is expressed as a spliced gene belonging to the early-late class. Proteomic analyses of CyHV- 3 infected cell supernatant demonstrated that the ORF 134 expression product is one of the most abundant proteins of the CyHV- 3 secretome. To investigate the role of ORF 134 in viral replication in vitro and in virulence in vivo, a <b>deleted</b> <b>strain</b> and a derived revertant strain were produced using BAC cloning technologies. The recombinant ORF 134 <b>deleted</b> <b>strain</b> replicated in vitro comparably to the parental and the revertant strains. Infection of fish by immersion in water containing the virus induced comparable CyHV- 3 disease for the three virus genotypes tested (wild type, deleted and revertant). Quantification of viral DNA by real time TaqMan PCR (in the gills and the kidney) and analysis of carp cytokine expression (in the spleen) by RT-qPCR at different times post-infection did not revealed any significant difference between the groups of fish infected with the three virus genotypes. Similarly, histological examination of the gills and the kidney of infected fish revealed no significant differences between fish infected with ORF 134 deleted virus versus fish infected with the control parental or revertant strains.

The effect of gene deletions on the flux distributions in the metabolic model of S. cerevisiae was assessed using Opt Gene as the modeling framework and minimization of metabolic adjustments (MOMA) as objective function. Deletion of NADPH-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase encoded by GDH 1 was identified as the best target gene {{for the improvement of}} sesquiterpene biosynthesis in yeast. Deletion of this gene enhances the available NADPH in the cytosol for other NADPH requiring enzymes, including HMG-CoA reductase. However, since disruption of GDH 1 impairs the ammonia utilization, simultaneous over-expression of the NADH-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase en coded by GDH 2 was also considered in this study. Deletion of GDH 1 led to an approximately 85 % increase in the final cubebol titer. However, deletion of this gene also caused a significant decrease in the maximum specific growth rate.

This appears to be so; <b>strains</b> <b>deleted</b> for pcnB, although defective in ColE 1 and R 1 plasmid maintenance, maintain the iteron-regulated plasmids F and P 1 normally. We also find that <b>strains</b> <b>deleted</b> for pcnB grow normally, demonstrating that PcnB has no essential cellular role under the conditions tested and suggesting that regulation by antisense RNAs similar to RNAI has no critical role in any essential host process.

40|$|Assimilable nitrogen, {{which is}} {{typically}} lacking in grape juice, {{is an important}} nutritional requirement of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. As such, fermentations frequently become protracted, terminate prematurely or develop undesirable aroma profiles. Amino acids and ammonium are the main sources of assimilable nitrogen in grape juice. The amino acid proline often predominates. Proline uptake is mediated by a high affinity, proline-specific permease, Put 4 p, and a low affinity general amino acid permease, Gap 1 p. The expression and activity of these transporters is subject to nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR) and nitrogen catabolite inactivation (NCI). That is, {{in the presence of}} a preferred nitrogen source, the expression of PUT 4 and GAP 1 is repressed and the permeases are inactivated. For yeast to fully exploit proline, its transport must be derepressed by depletion of other (preferred) amino acids and molecular oxygen must be present to allow proline catabolism by proline oxidase. Consequently, as oxygen is typically depleted well before the other amino acids in grape juice are reduced to non-repressive concentrations, proline is largely un-utilised by yeast during oenological fermentation. This study aims to overcome these metabolic restrictions on proline utilisation. A preliminary study was conducted to determine the potential for proline transport-capable strains to utilise proline during the initial stages of fermentation when oxygen may be present, particularly in red grape must. Initially, the transcriptional regulation of the PUT 4 gene was targeted to generate strains capable of proline transport under normally repressive conditions. In the first case, the URE 2 gene, encoding a negative regulator involved in nitrogen discrimination, was deleted. In the second case, PUT 4 was expressed from the constitutive TEF 2 promoter. It was observed that both strains express PUT 4 {{in the presence of a}} preferred nitrogen source. This expression led to Put 4 p activity during the initial stages of growth and fermentation, with Put 4 p activity declining over the course of the growth phase. Proline removal from the media, however, was limited to the initial stages of fermentation while oxygen was available. It seems that the rapid depletion of oxygen limits the amount of proline transported into the yeast cell. The two proline transport-capable mutants were analysed for growth and fermentation characteristics. It was found that the deletion of the URE 2 gene led to a slow initial growth and the formation of a larger biomass. The ure 2 <b>delete</b> <b>strain</b> also utilised significantly more nitrogen during fermentation than the wild type. Consequently, a ure 2 <b>delete</b> <b>strain</b> would not be suitable for industrial use. The expression of PUT 4 from a constitutive promoter did lead to an increase in nitrogen assimilation during fermentation when compared with the wild type. However, this observed increase was significantly less than that observed in the ure 2 <b>delete</b> <b>strain.</b> In an effort to produce a proline transport-capable strain with potential industrial benefit, strains constitutive for PUT 4 specifically were isolated using random, in vitro mutagenesis of the PUT 4 promoter region. Four point mutations were identified that, when introduced singly into the PUT 4 promoter, led to expression of PUT 4 in the presence of a preferred nitrogen source. The rapid depletion of oxygen observed in the preliminary study will limit the potential usefulness of strains capable of proline transport. Micro-oxygenation is rapidly becoming an accepted practice during oenological fermentation. The potential benefit of the controlled addition of oxygen during fermentation is restricted by the timing of any oxygen addition. Oxygen additions made at the onset of the stationary phase are the most beneficial. During the preliminary study, it was noted that Put 4 p activity decreased during the growth phase to low levels at the onset of the stationary phase. To ensure that sufficient active Put 4 p is present at the onset of the stationary phase, the post-translational control of the Put 4 p was investigated. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to target residues in the carboxy-terminal region of Put 4 p that are potentially involved in the ammonia-induced down-regulation of the permease. The substitution, S 605 A, lead to the amelioration of ammonia-induced down-regulation of Put 4 p. The activity of the Put 4 p S 605 A variant decreased over the course of the growth phase, but not to the same extent observed in the wild type. Furthermore, a recovery seen after down-regulation restored a greater percentage of the original activity compared with the wild type. To determine whether such a strain proved better able to ferment media in the presence of micro-oxygenation, the fermentation kinetics of a strain constitutively expressing PUT 4 (S 605 A) were compared with the wild type. Micro-oxygenation of ferments did not result in an increase in fermentation rate nor a decrease in fermentation time in the mutant. However, the cell viability of the strain capable of proline transport was increased in comparison with the wild type, suggesting a role for proline in stress responses within the yeast cell.

40|$|Persistent R-loops lead to replicative stress due to RNA {{polymerase}} stalling and DNA damage. RNase H enzymes {{facilitate the}} organisms {{to survive in}} the hostile condition by removing these R-loops. MS_RHII-RSD was previously identified to be the second (p) ppGpp synthetase in Mycobacterium smegmatis. The unique presence of an additional RNase HII domain raises an important question regarding the significance of this bifunctional protein. In this report, we demonstrate its ability to hydrolyze R-loops in Escherichia coli exposed to UV stress. MS_RHII-RSD gene expression was upregulated under UV stress, and this gene <b>deleted</b> <b>strain</b> showed increased R-loop accumulation as compared to the wild type. The domains in isolation are known to be inactive, and the full length protein is required for its function. Domain interdependence studies using active site mutants reveal the necessity of a hexamer form with high alpha helical content. In previous studies, bacterial RNase type HI has been mainly implicated in R-loop hydrolysis, but in this study, the RNase HII domain containing protein showed the activity. The prospective of this differential RNase HII activity is discussed. This is the first report to implicate a (p) ppGpp synthetase protein in R-loop-induced stress response...|$|E
40|$|Engineering {{control of}} {{metabolic}} pathways {{is important to}} improving product titers and yields. Traditional methods such as overexpressing pathway enzymes and deleting competing ones are restricted by the interdependence of metabolic reactions and the finite nature of cellular resources. Here, we developed a metabolite valve that controls glycolytic flux through central carbon metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In a Hexokinase 2 and Glucokinase 1 <b>deleted</b> <b>strain</b> (hxk 2 Δglk 1 Δ), glucose flux was diverted away from glycolysis and into a model pathway, gluconate, by controlling the transcription of Hexokinase 1 with the tetracycline transactivator protein (tTA). A maximum 10 -fold decrease in hexokinase activity resulted in a 50 -fold increase in gluconate yields, from 0. 7 % to 36 % mol/mol of glucose. The reduction in glucose flux resulted in {{a significant decrease in}} ethanol byproduction that extended to semianaerobic conditions, as shown in the production of isobutanol.

40|$|The rpoZ {{gene for}} the omega subunit of Escherichia coli RNA {{polymerase}} constitutes single operon with the spoT gene, {{which is responsible}} for the maintenance of stringent response under nutrient starvation conditions. To identify the physiological role of the omega subunit, we compared the gene expression profile of wild-type Escherichia coli with that of an rpoZ <b>deleted</b> <b>strain</b> by microarray analysis using an E. coli DNA chip. Here we report on a set of genes which show changes in expression profile following the removal of rpoZ. We have seen that relA, {{which is responsible for}} the synthesis of the stringent factor ppGpp and many ribosomal proteins, exhibited noticeable changes in mRNA levels and were therefore further analyzed for their expression using a GFP/RFP two- fluorescent protein promoter assay vector. In the absence of rpoZ, the promoter for the relA gene was severely impaired, but the promoters from the ribosomal protein genes were not affected as much. Taking these results together we propose that the omega subunit is involved in regulation of the relA gene, but induction of the stringently controlled genes in the absence of rpoZ is, at least in part, attributable to a decrease in ppGpp level...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Streptococcus pneumoniae is an {{important}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} worldwide, including meningitis. Here, we employed the isogenic Δspr 0075 -, Δspr 1370 - and Δspr 1875 -knock-out mutants of the DP 1004 pneumococcal strain to investigate the role of these proteins in the interaction with microglia, the resident brain macrophages. Methods: By screening a whole genome phage display library with sera from patients, we identified clones carrying pneumococcal B-cell epitopes. Among these, we isolated six antigenic fragments of sequences matching three previously unidentified proteins, encoded by the ORFs spr 0075, spr 1370 and spr 1875 of R 6 strain genomic sequence. By using an in vitro infection model and a gentamicin protection assay we evaluated, respectively, the ability of microglial BV 2 cells to phagocytose and kill the isogenic mutants and the survival of these bacteria inside the microglia. Results: All strains were efficiently internalized by BV 2 cells; yet the levels of phagocytosis obtained with Δspr 0075 strain were lower than those observed with the other groups. The survival of the <b>deleted</b> <b>strains</b> inside the microglia was significantly different. The residual CFU of Δspr 1370 and Δspr 1875 mutants were, indeed, respectively, higher and lower, than those observed with parental DP 1004. Moreover, preliminary results indicate that a similar trend is also observed in a bactericidal assay using BV 2 as effector cells. Conclusion: These findings indicate that the proteins encoded by spr 1370 and spr 1875 loci are involved in interaction between S. pneumoniae and microglia...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} demand for clean, sustainable and renewable energy resources has driven the development of various microbial systems to produce biofuels.

40|$|BACKGROUND—cag {{pathogenicity}} island (PAI) {{is reported}} to be a major virulence factor of Helicobacter pylori.  AIM—To characterise cagA and the cag PAI in Japanese H pylori strains.  METHODS—H pylori isolates from Japanese patients were evaluated for CagA by immunoblot, for cagA transcription by northern blot, and for cagA and 13 other cag PAI genes by Southern blot. cagA negative strains from Western countries were also studied. Induction of interleukin- 8 secretion from gastric epithelial cells was also investigated.  RESULTS—All Japanese strains retained cagA. Fifty nine of 63 (94 %) strains had all the cag PAI genes. In the remaining four, cag PAI was partially deleted, lacking cagA transcripts and not producing CagA protein. Details of the PAI of these strains were checked; three lacked cagB to cagQ (cagI) and continuously cagS to cag 13 (cagII), and the remaining one lacked cagB to cag 8. Western cagA negative strains completely lacked cag PAI including cagA. Nucleotide sequence analysis in one strain in which the cag PAI was partially deleted showed that the partial deletion contained 25 kb of cag PAI and the cagA promoter. Interleukin- 8 induction was lower with the cag PAI partial deletion strains than with the intact ones. All Japanese cag PAI <b>deleted</b> <b>strains</b> were derived from patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia, whereas 41 of 59 (70 %) CagA-producing strains were from patients with peptic ulcers or gastric cancer (p< 0. 05).  CONCLUSIONS—Most Japanese H pylori strains had the intact cag PAI. However, some lacked most of the cag PAI in spite of the presence of cagA. Thus the presence of the cagA gene is not an invariable marker of cag PAI related virulence in Japanese strains. ...|$|R
