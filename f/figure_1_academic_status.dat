40|$|Permission {{granted by}} publisherIn 1975, the Canadian Association of University Teachers (CAUT) and the Canadian Association of College and University Libraries (CACUL) officially {{recognized}} {{the concept of}} <b>academic</b> <b>status</b> for Canadian <b>academic</b> librarians. This recognition was both welcomed and feared by both rank-and-file librarians {{as well as the}} library administrators. As a result, the application of <b>academic</b> <b>status</b> across Canadian universities has been inconsistent in both rights and responsibilities and has been easily confused with the faculty <b>status</b> accorded to <b>academic</b> librarians in the United States. This chapter will lay out some of the issues of the day that culminated in the recognition of <b>academic</b> <b>status,</b> will discuss the controversies around <b>academic</b> <b>status</b> for Canadian <b>academic</b> librarians, and will touch on some of the inconsistencies and challenges that remain to this day.

40|$|The {{present study}} intends {{to study the}} extent of {{utilization}} of information centers and e-journals as well as satisfaction rate and to correlate these with age and <b>academic</b> <b>status</b> of faculty members at medical schools in Iranian medical universities. A questionnaire was used for data collection. 700 faculty members were selected using regular random sampling. Results indicate that faculty members use e-journals more than printed journals. Satisfaction rate with databases {{as well as their}} utilization is high. Digital libraries are used heavily for document access. A combination of digital library and print library comes second, followed by using print libraries exclusively. The study further demonstrates that there is a link between variables such as age and using e-journals, age and using information centers, age and satisfaction with specialized databases. There was no correlation between <b>academic</b> <b>status</b> and e-journal usage, <b>academic</b> <b>status</b> and satisfaction with electronic databases and academic ranking with using information centers...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the role of}} the <b>academic</b> <b>status</b> in the following behaviour of computer scientists on Twitter. Based on a uses and gratifications perspective, we focus on the activity of a Twitter account and the reciprocity of following relationships. We propose that the account activity addresses the users' information motive only, whereas the user's <b>academic</b> <b>status</b> relates to both the information motive and community development (as in peer networking or career planning). Variables were extracted from Twitter user data. We applied a biographical approach to correctly identify the <b>academic</b> <b>status</b> (professor versus PhD student). We calculated a 2 × 2 MANOVA on the influence of the activity of the account and the <b>academic</b> <b>status</b> (on different groups of followers) to differentiate the influence of the information motive versus the motive for community development. Results suggest that for computer scientists Twitter is mainly an information network. However, we found significant effects in the sense of career planning, that is, the accounts of professors had even in the case of low activity a relatively high number of researcher followers [...] both PhD followers as well as professor followers. Additionally, there was also some weak evidence for community development gratifications in the sense of peer-networking of professors. Overall, we conclude that the academic use of Twitter is not only about information, but also about career planning and networking...|$|R

A mixed-method design was used. Survey data, as well as personal interview data, was collected. A total of 695 students out of 830 students who were placed on A 1 probation status attended a mandatory workshop prior {{to the beginning of the}} Fall 2015 semester. Out of the 695 students, 194 completed their GEMM pre-survey correctly and were assessed to determine if factors of GEMM correlated with successful <b>academic</b> probation <b>status</b> removal. A total of 211 students expressed interest in participating in the review of GEMM tutorial interventions, with 31 students committing to participate in the intervention program, and only 13 completing. Academic self- efficacy was the only GEMM factor found to be predictive of <b>academic</b> probation <b>status</b> removal. Student perception of the online GEMM tutorial interventions was overwhelmingly positive with the majority of the students favoring the video content of personal student interviews. Participation and follow-through proved to be problematic for this study, and only 79 out of the 695 students on A <b>1</b> <b>academic</b> probation returned to good standing by the following semester.

40|$|For what reasons do {{academics}} follow {{one another}} on Twitter? Robert Jäschke, Stephanie B. Linek and Christian P.

As well as there being reciprocal following between users of the same <b>academic</b> <b>status</b> (except, remarkably, between PhD researchers), a form of strategic politeness can be observed whereby users follow those of higher <b>academic</b> <b>status</b> without necessarily being followed back. The emerging academic public sphere facilitated by Twitter is largely shaped by dynamics and hierarchies all too familiar to researchers struggling to plot their careers in academia...|$|R

30|$|The tracker {{shown in}} <b>Figure</b> <b>1</b> j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s takes single arena videos and {{corresponding}} smoothened backgrounds as input (cf. first column of the tracker <b>figure,</b> <b>Figure</b> <b>1</b> j,u,t). The second column shows the arena after subtracting the smoothened backgrounds (first and second rows, <b>Figure</b> <b>1</b> p,k) {{and the results}} of a gradient procedure in the third row (<b>Figure</b> <b>1</b> n). Further processing is based on the gray level histogram shown {{in the middle of the}} third column (<b>Figure</b> <b>1</b> l). Two different thresholds are used for body and wing detection. Using the thresholds for body region together with the gradient pictures for the boundaries, we obtain a picture for the body region (<b>Figure</b> <b>1</b> m). Using this result in connection with the threshold for wing detection, we obtain from (<b>Figure</b> <b>1</b> p) the first image of the binarized body-wing region (<b>Figure</b> <b>1</b> q). This image is further improved by filling holes (<b>Figure</b> <b>1</b> r). Resulting body regions (<b>Figure</b> <b>1</b> m) and wing regions (<b>Figure</b> <b>1</b> r) are marked in the original image in <b>Figure</b> <b>1</b> s. Extraction of primary attributes directly from images (<b>Figure</b> <b>1</b> m) and (<b>Figure</b> <b>1</b> r) concludes the image processing step. These attributes build the interface to the postprocessor module. We derive for both body and wing region: the number of pixels Area, the region Perimeter and the center of gravity Centroid, Orientation, MinorAxisLength and MajorAxisLength of a covering ellipse.|$|R
