50|$|Researchers {{identified}} {{three groups of}} women to represent the dimensions of gender roles in Singapore.

Although they are from the Singaporean middle class, they are stuck at almost the same level and share status with the third group, foreign domestic workers. Because of global economic restructuring and global city formation, the mobility of female labours is increasing. However, they are controlled through strict enforcement and they are statistically invisible in migration data. The female foreign domestic workers are always gender-stereotyped as maids and generalized as low wages workers in society.|$|E

50|$|Sex {{work and}} {{prostitution}} {{have often been}} compared to a marriage in which the man is the breadwinner, while the woman stays at home and cares for the family. There {{does not appear to}} be a distinction between the woman who has devoted her body to her husband in exchange for his promise to take care of her, and the sex worker who has chosen to sell sexual acts in exchange for payment. Radical feminists and others opposed to prostitution will state that marriage and monogamy cannot be compared to prostitution because a marriage is beyond a contract, and a marriage does not advocate for the dominance of the man over the woman. However, the difference goes beyond dominance but to choice. The true difference between the <b>dependent</b> <b>spouse</b> and the sex worker is that the independent sex worker does not belong to one man; in fact, she does not belong to anyone but herself.|$|E
5000|$|Liberalization {{of divorce}} laws {{occurred}} in the 19th century, but divorce was only possible in cases of marital misconduct. As a result, the requirement to pay alimony became linked {{to the concept of}} fault in the divorce. Alimony to wives was paid because it was assumed that the marriage, and the wife's right to support, would have continued but for the misbehavior of the husband. Ending alimony on divorce would have permitted a guilty husband to profit from his own misconduct. In contrast, if the wife committed the misconduct, she was considered to have forfeited any claim to ongoing support. However, during the period, parties could rarely afford alimony, and so it was rarely awarded by courts. As husbands' incomes increased, and with it the possibility of paying alimony, the awarding of alimony increased, generally because a wife could show a need for ongoing financial support, and the husband had the ability to pay. No-fault divorce led to changes in alimony. Whereas spousal support was considered a right under the fault-based system, it became conditional under the no-fault approach. According to the American Bar Association, marital fault is a [...] "factor" [...] in awarding alimony in 25 states and the District of Columbia. Permanent alimony began to fall out of favor, as it prevented former spouses from beginning new lives, though in some states (e.g., Massachusetts, Mississippi, and Tennessee), permanent alimony awards continued, but with some limitations. Alimony moved beyond support to permitting the more <b>dependent</b> <b>spouse</b> to become financially independent or to have the same standard of living as during the marriage or common law marriage, though this was not possible in most cases.|$|E

This study investigated the relationship of some selected demographic factors and acculturation level among scholars and their <b>dependent</b> <b>spouses</b> from Mainland China. The demographic factors chosen as independent variables of the study included length of exposure to the host culture, age at migration, gender, status, and participation in adult learning. The dependent variable, acculturation level of the participants, was measured through the adaptation of the Suinn-Lew Asian Acculturation Identity Scale. The dependent variable was correlated with each independent variable to explore their respective relationship. The Pearson product-moment coefficient of correlation was employed to describe the strength of the relationship between each pair of variables. The sample group of the study was composed of 102 Chinese scholars and their <b>dependent</b> <b>spouses</b> residing in the Midwest United States. All of them came to the US as graduate students, visiting scholars, or <b>dependent</b> <b>spouses</b> from Mainland China in the last twenty years or so. The {{purpose of the study was}} to discover the major factors with significant impact on the acculturation of the target population and to identify the population as a specific subgroup of Chinese immigrants. The acculturation literature reveals the relationship of some demographic factors and acculturation level in various ethnic groups of immigrants. Length of exposure to the host culture, age at migration, and gender are among the most evident factors correlated with acculturation level, though the strength and direction of relationship vary from one ethnic group to another. The study adopted these three demographic factors as independent variables and added two more to expand the scope of study, one focusing on the differences between scholars and their <b>dependent</b> <b>spouses,</b> and the other emphasizing the connections between acculturation and adult learning. Conclusions were made based on analyses of the data collected with the adapted SL-ASIA and the demographic questionnaire. A significant positive relationship was found between length of exposure to the host culture and acculturation level, between status and acculturation level, and between participation in adult learning and acculturation level among the participants, while no significant relationship was found between age at migration and acculturation level, or between gender and acculturation level in the sample group. In addition to these conclusions as they relate to the current literature, the personal experiences of the researcher as well as those of his family were included to provide further validation of the findings resulting from an analysis of the survey data. While limited by its research design in exploring the interactions of the variables upon each other, this study makes recommendations for future research with questions and subjects in the fields of acculturation and adult education...|$|R
30|$|We {{show that}} the models match {{the low level of}} the Italian labor force {{participation}} and employment rates and replicates the positive correlation between wife’s participation rate and husband’s yearly income. Moreover, we {{show that the}} Italian individual taxation system generates disincentives for women’s labor supply, especially when married with children. This is due to a set of tax credits for <b>dependent</b> <b>spouses</b> and children, universal cash transfers for children that increase the fiscal burden of low-income households, and the second earner tax rate of women married to low-income or unemployed men.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{treatment}} of families in thirteen European income tax systems: twelve countries from the European Union and Poland. For the sake of simplicity families with only one wage earner are considered. In the first section, we survey the main features of twelve European tax systems {{to take account of}} <b>dependent</b> <b>spouse</b> and children. In the second section, we compare the tax-exempt income brackets for each country. In the third section, we calculate the costs that each tax system associates with the presence of <b>dependent</b> <b>spouse</b> and children in the taxpayer’s family. These costs may be explicitly stated as fiscal arrangements and child benefits or implicitly derived as a function of tax credits, family quotients and tax schedules. In the fourth section, the tax systems of Italy, Ireland, Belgium, Germany, France, Portugal and Poland are simulated on a representative population derived from the total number of employees in Italy. The simulation allows to evaluate the total tax yield and the impact of the different fiscal frameworks on three family types: single households, married couples with dependent children, singles with dependent children...|$|E

30|$|In panel a), we can {{see that}} the married-unmarried {{difference}} in SET is particularly relevant for low women’s earnings (less than 4, 000 euros) and dies down as the income increases. The pick of the SET of married women occurs in correspondence with yearly earnings of about 3, 500 euros. At that point, husbands are not entitled to receive a tax credit for <b>dependent</b> <b>spouses,</b> and the SET jumps from 9 to about 30 percent. These couples face a trade-off between having the wife participating in the labor market earning a very low salary and not receiving tax credits (but still increasing the total household income) versus not participating and paying lower taxes (because of the tax credits).|$|R
