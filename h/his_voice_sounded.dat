Shortly thereafter, his father died, leaving his mother to raise the family. Some reports state that Tebbetts {{acquired}} his nickname as a boy after an aunt observed that <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> like a bird chirping, while other reports state the nickname was acquired while attending Providence College.|$|E
500|$|Bryan {{continued}} with language evoking the Civil War, telling his audience that [...] "in this contest brother has been arrayed against brother, father against son." [...] By then, {{as he spoke}} in a sincere tone, <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> clearly and loudly through the hall. He denied, however that the contest was personal; he bore no ill-will towards those who supported the gold standard. However, he stated, facing towards the gold delegates, [...] "when you come before us and tell us that we are about to disturb your business interests, we reply that you have disturbed our business interests by your course." [...] The gold men, during the address, paid close attention and showed their appreciation for Bryan's oratory. Bryan then defended the right of silver supporters to make their argument against opposition from gold men, who were associated with financial interests, especially in the East. Although his statements nominally responded to a point made by Russell, Bryan had thought of the argument the previous evening, and had not used it in earlier speeches. He always regarded it as the best point he made during the speech, and only the ending caused more reaction from his listeners: ...|$|E
2500|$|Recording {{began as}} soon as the band entered Ocean Way Studios in Los Angeles on March 6, 2002. Much of Sea Change was {{recorded}} live, with extra effects (including bells and strings) added later. In order to capture the immediacy of the material, the artists worked quickly and spontaneously, frequently laying second takes of songs to disc. During production, Beck realized his singing voice had gotten significantly deeper. [...] "Before we recorded," [...] said Godrich, [...] "We listened to Mutations, and <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> like Mickey Mouse. His range has dropped. Now when he opens his mouth, a canyonesque vibration comes out. It's quite remarkable. He has amazing tone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then Mr. Fox stopped {{digging and}} pricked up his ears, making <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sound</b> mighty soft as he asked, {{as if he}} were my best friend: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, nothing," [...] said Grandfather Frog, {{trying to}} make <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sound</b> as if he weren't interested. [...] "I just {{wondered}} where the long-legged nuisance might be." ...|$|R
50|$|During {{the time}} when Kenneth Ma was portraying the younger version of Kiu Ngo Tin his was dubbed by Maxwell Hui to make <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sound</b> more like the voice of Anthony Wong.|$|R
2500|$|During May 2002 Wilson {{recorded}} his next album, King for a Day (July 2002), at two studios in Melbourne with Kerryn Tolhurst producing. Along with Bourne, Folley and Rodgers, the album featured Tollhurst (guest guitars, piano, mandolin and tipple), Cindy Boste (guest lead vocals), Sarah Carroll (guest lead vocals) and Skip Sail (guest banjo). In March 2003 Richard Sharman of I-94 Bar website reviewed Chris Wilson and The Spidermen's gig at the Bridge Hotel in Sydney, {{and found that}} Wilson's [...] "voice was magnificent ranging from soft tenderness to a bellowing roar that raised shivers {{at the back of}} my neck. <b>His</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> better than ever and his harp playing was superb â€“ this boy can play!" ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{arrangement}} {{was made with}} Ronnie Storm (no connection to Rory Storm) to back him on the single release [...] "My Desire", and it was released under the pseudonym [...] "Fuzzy and The Barnets" [...] due to contractual difficulties encountered by Storm. At the same time Steve Rowland, of Family Dogg, heard the band playing live on Radio One Club and offered to sign them to his production company. He arranged for Albert Hammond, who was also in Family Dogg, to write a number for the band, which Hammond duly did. This track was entitled [...] "It Never Rains in Southern California", but {{before it could be}} released, he decided that he wanted to record it for himself. Kelly was later asked by Steve Rowland to play drums on it. Accordingly, Hammond wrote a few other songs for the band, and a single [...] "You Ring a Bell"/"Have You Met Angela" [...] was recorded and prepared for release, but due to various problems in Rowland's organisation, it was never released. In late 1971 the band's management was taken over by Dave Eager, the BBC Radio One DJ, and Norman suffered a serious infection that affected his vocal cords. After his recovery, <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> much rougher, which the other group members considered an interesting addition to their sound. Eager introduced them to Decca, which resulted in recordings in February 1972, their first single being [...] "Oh Julie"/"I Love You Carolina". Shortly thereafter, their next single was released. [...] "Let the Good Times Roll" [...] was liked by the media and was selected as the show's opening theme for Emperor Rosko's BBC Radio One Saturday show, but this popularity did not translate into record sales. The last single on Decca was [...] "Make it Better"/"Lonely Long Lady", which flopped and led to Decca terminating their contracts.|$|E
60|$|He waited some moments, then <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> gently, half mocking, half reproachful.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was fully}} {{five minutes before}} Harry succeeded in gaining the mastery over his fears, and then he said, with an evident attempt to make <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sound</b> firm as he leaped from the rail: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good morning," [...] said Sammy Jay, {{and tried}} very hard to make <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sound</b> smooth and pleasant, a very hard thing for Sammy to do, for <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> you know, is {{naturally}} harsh and unpleasant. [...] "You seem to be looking as happy as ever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come out, Peter. I'm {{waiting for}} you!" [...] he called down the hall, and made <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sound</b> as angry as he could. But inside he was chuckling. Then Jimmy Skunk calmly {{turned and went}} about his business. He had kept his word.|$|R
60|$|<b>His</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> hoarse and unreal, and he {{had spoken}} with {{apparent}} effort.|$|E
60|$|Ray broke in. <b>His</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> harsh, his manner, I thought, was {{unnecessarily}} brutal.|$|E
60|$|Then the Ghost spoke again, and <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> {{like the}} sighing of the wind.|$|E
6000|$|... "I couldn't {{think of}} taking you by storm like this," [...] Captain Griffiths replied, with a wistfulness which only made <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sound</b> hoarser and more unpleasant. [...] "It is most kind of you, Lady Cranston. Perhaps you {{will give me}} another opportunity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you please, Mistah Buzzard, you {{can tell}} me if there is anybody way down South where you come from who can make <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sound</b> just like the voices of other people. Is there?" [...] Bobby was using his very politest manner.|$|R
5000|$|Mummato (voiced by Rob Paulsen) - One of Zoltan's gang of six. Mummato rules over Australia and New Zealand, and {{is known}} for his silence (though he does speak on rare occasions; <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounds</b> much like Marlon Brando). Mummato is wrapped in {{bandages}} like a mummy.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> {{again in}} the darkness, {{speaking}} quietly, speaking with a note almost of satisfaction.|$|E
60|$|The man was {{trembling}} with excitement. There were drops of perspiration upon his forehead. <b>His</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> unnatural.|$|E
60|$|He had {{apparently}} risen and walked towards the door. <b>His</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> from {{another part of}} the room.|$|E
60|$|The {{little man}} smiled a {{suffering}} smile. The twang of <b>his</b> toneless <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> a trifle shriller.|$|R
5000|$|Pedro: A white {{dog with}} brown spots. In [...] "Super Koda", it is {{revealed}} that he loves eating dog biscuits. In [...] "Bossy Boots", he {{is in charge of}} the school because the dogs have to clean up after themselves. <b>His</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounds</b> similar to rapper Rick Ross. He is a rat terrier.|$|R
6000|$|... "Seize yonder knave," [...] shouted Sakon, {{and search}} was made but without avail. Afterwards, however, Aziel remembered that once, {{when they were}} weather-bound on their journey from the coast, Metem had amused them by making <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sound</b> from various {{quarters}} of the hut in which they lay. Then Ithobal rose and said:-- ...|$|R
60|$|Even {{to himself}} <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> harsh and unnatural, his words {{instinct}} with the graceless cruelty of a clown.|$|E
6000|$|His grim face relaxed, and <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> {{different}} {{when he spoke}} of Grace, while a few moments passed before he added: ...|$|E
60|$|He {{pronounced}} {{that one}} {{word in a}} tone so utterly unlike his natural tone that <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> quite strange to me.|$|E
5000|$|Buzzy is a ferret who is {{friends with}} the Zula Patrol. With his {{translator}} collar on, he can speak human. Even though <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounds</b> like Richard Steven Horvitz, he is voiced by Dave Wittenberg. He appears in two episodes titled [...] "Take Me To Your Ferret" [...] and [...] "You're Cramping My Space".|$|R
5000|$|Aaron Fields from KSTW.com says [...] "This {{is one of}} the {{standout}} beats on this album. Talk about bumpin' this is the one to bump right here. A nice mid-tempo {{track with}} much bass. You'll want to put this one on repeat. <b>His</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounds</b> great on this track and the arrangement is on point once again".|$|R
5000|$|One notable early {{practitioner}} of pitch shifting in music is Chuck Berry, {{who used the}} technique to make <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sound</b> younger. Many of the Beatles' records from 1966 and 1967 were made by recording instrumental tracks a half-step higher and the vocals correspondingly low. Examples include [...] "Rain", [...] "I'm Only Sleeping", and [...] "When I'm Sixty-Four".|$|R
6000|$|... "Come dine with me again," [...] said Buster Bear, {{and somehow}} this time Old Mr. Toad didn't mind because <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> grumbly-rumbly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dee, dee, dee, chickadee! See me! See me!" [...] called Tommy Tit, and <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> cheerier {{than ever}} and merrier than ever.|$|E
60|$|He read it over, {{letter by}} letter, word by word. Then {{at last he}} looked up. <b>His</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounded,</b> even to himself, unnatural.|$|E
50|$|Goodman is {{also known}} for <b>his</b> deep throat <b>voice</b> which has been poked fun at {{numerous}} times in Family Guy audio commentaries, particularly by the creator Seth MacFarlane and writer Alec Sulkin who both believe <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounds</b> a lot like Ray Romano's. As a result, Goodman has voiced parodies of Romano in Family Guy episodes by not doing an impression, but by simply talking.|$|R
60|$|A weaker {{woman he}} would have bullied. His veins were filled with anger. His tongue ached to spend itself. Naida's bearing cowed him. She {{remained}} a dominating figure. The unnatural restraint imposed upon himself, however, made <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sound</b> hard and unfamiliar. There were little patches of white around his mouth; his teeth showed, when he spoke, more than usual.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed he did. You can't {{believe what}} a goose he is! Then <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounds</b> like a cracked bell; it's the most disagreeable voice {{you ever heard}} in your life. And one has always to be on one's guard lest he should make one do {{something}} that is--is--that isn't quite the thing for a gentleman. You understand;--what the messenger ought to do." ...|$|R
