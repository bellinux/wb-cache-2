Proteins are also recognised as one of the main classes of surface-active agents in liquid foods for stabilizing dispersed particles and fat droplets (Dalgleish, 1997), due to the polarised distribution of hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups along the back bone. Protein molecules adsorb at the oil–water interface to lower the interfacial tension and, therefore, make such thermodynamically less favourable dispersed systems stable for an extended shelf life. The importance of protein application in foods can also be seen in many other aspects.

The 3 samples of each of corn, rice broken (RB), rice polishings (RP) and wheat bran (WB) were assayed for AMEn by substitution method using 21 -days-old broilers. The 12 experimental diets (4 ingredients x 3 samples) were formulated by substituting the corn-soybean meal basal diet with 30 % test ingredients.

Each diet was offered to 36 birds, equally distributed to six replicate pens. The basal diet continued to feed the birds of 6 replicates from day 14 to 21. The excreta samples were collected for 3 days, day 19 - 21 and AMEn was calculated. The average daily feed intake (ADFI), average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were calculated from 14 - 21 days of age.

40|$|Molds play an {{important}} role in flavor of fermented sausage production. However mycotoxinogenic species are common sausage contaminants, too. Penicillium nordicum, represents the main toxinogenic species isolated from artisanal sausages of different area of Lombardy, a region in the North of Italy, and of Europe. P. nordicum growing on the surface of sausages, produces Ochratoxin A (OTA), which penetrating the meat, can be a potential health risk for consumers. The presence of OTA on casing represent an additional risk, because in Italy consumers are used to eat both meat and casing of artisanal sausages. To avoid the growth of P. nordicum does not appear effective in reducing OTA, in particular in artisanal facilities where it is impossible to check the parameters of Production (Umidity Relative, Temperature, Time). Therefore other systems are needed to prevent its growth to eliminate OTA from sausage. Different methods are proposed, including brushing and washing sausages or by spreading starter cultures on the casings before drying and ripening (Iacumin et al., 2009). By applying both systems, OTA concentration was reduced but nevertheless it is used to find artisanal sausages with OTA on the casing or inside the meat. Moreover the use of starter cultures is not choose by some producers, because they think that the sausages must be done without any additives or <b>ingredients</b> <b>excepted</b> salt, pepper and nitrate and nitrite. Considering the OTA (Italian Law limit 1 μg/Kg). The use of ozone did not influence the ripening, the physico-chemical parameters, the peroxide value and the sensorial characteristic of the sausages. Our data suggest that the presence of OTA on sausage surfaces could represent a food health risk only when the molds are not removed from casings. To reduce the health risk, for consumers that are used to eat both meat and casing of artisanal sausages, we suggest to limit the growth by treatment with ozonated air during drying and ripening. However, despite, these good result, we think that the use of starter molds is the best technology to eliminate the risk of OTA and OTA producing mold. To eliminate completely the risk, it is sufficient to inoculate starter mold cultures after the casing and after the end of drying. In this way the mold cultures inhibites the OTA producing molds during all the period of ripening. Keywords: fermented Sausages, Ochratoxin A, Penicillum nordicum, ozonated ai...|$|R

Mean apparent daily DP requirement for 7. 69 to 13. 08 -g L. vannamei fed the 25 % protein diet was 6. 31 g DP kg- 1 BW d- 1 while the 35 % protein diet produced a mean apparent daily DP requirement of 8. 00 g DP kg- 1 BW d- 1 for 8. 11 - to 13. 79 -g L. vannamei.

Mean apparent daily DE requirement for shrimp fed the 25 % protein diet was 402. 62 kJ DE kg- 1 BW d- 1 while the 35 % protein diet produced an apparent daily DE requirement of 334. 72 kJ DE kg- 1 BW d- 1.

The most frequent Aspergillus species was A. flavus (60. 66 %) isolated from all the feed ingredients as well as pellet feed. Among 37 A. flavus isolates, 19 (51. 35 %) were able to produce AFB 1 on yeast extract-sucrose (YES) broth {{in the range of}} 10. 2 to 612. 8 [tg/g fungal dry weight. HPLC analyses of trout feed showed that pellet feed and all feed <b>ingredients</b> tested <b>except</b> gluten were contaminated with different levels of AFB 1 in the range of 1. 83 to 67. 35 lig/kg. In order to finding natural inhibitors of fungal growth and/or AF production, essential oils (EOs) and extracts of 49 medicinal plants were studied against an aflatoxin-producing A. parasiticus using a microbioassay technique. The EOs was analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Based on the results obtained, Achillea millefolium sub sp. elborsensis, Ferula gummosa, Mentha spicata, Azadirachta indica, Conium maculatum and Artemisia dracunculus remarkably inhibited A. parasiticus growth without affecting AF production by the fungus. Besides of Thymus vulgaris and Citrus aurantifolia, the EO of Foeniculum vulgare significantly inhibited both fungal growth (- 70. 0 %) and AFs B 1 and G 1 (- 99. 0 %) production. The EO of Carum carvi and ethyl acetate extract of Platycladus orientalis suppressed AFs B 1 and G 1 by more than 90. 0 %, without any obvious effect on fungal growth. The IC 50 values of bioactive plants for AFs B 1 and G 1 were determined in the ranges of 90. 6 to 576. 2 and 2. 8 to 61. 9 µg/ml, respectively. Overall, {{results of the present study}} indicate the importance of AF contamination of trout feed as a risk factor for fish farming and thus, an urgent necessity for constant monitoring of trout feed for any unacceptable levels of AF contamination. Likewise, antifungal activities of bioactive plants introduced here would be an important contribution to explain the use of these plants as effective antimicrobial candidates to protect feeds from toxigenic fungus growth and subsequent AF contamination...|$|R
