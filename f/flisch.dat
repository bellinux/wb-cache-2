5000|$|The University of Georgia gave Julia <b>Flisch</b> {{an honorary}} master's degree in 1889, 20 {{years after she}} was not admitted, making her {{the first woman to}} receive this honor from the university. When <b>Flisch</b> died in 1941, she was {{acclaimed}} as having done [...] "more than any other person to advance the cause of women’s education in the state of Georgia." [...] In 1994, <b>Flisch</b> was inducted into the Georgia Women of Achievement.|$|E
5000|$|Julia <b>Flisch</b> (31 January 1861 - 17 March 1941) was a Georgia writer, educator, and {{advocate}} for women's rights {{to education and}} independence. <b>Flisch</b> was known for her call to [...] "Give the girls a chance!" [...] in her fight for equity in education access.|$|E
50|$|Julia <b>Flisch</b> {{was born}} in Augusta, Georgia. She was the {{daughter}} of Leonard <b>Flisch</b> and Pauline W. Heolzapfel, from Switzerland and Germany, respectively. Their marriage and struggle to forge a cohesive identity consistent with America's values inspired much of Julia's personality and storytelling.Flisch grew up in Athens, Georgia, where her father ran a candy shop near the University of Georgia campus. <b>Flisch</b> yearned to attend the university after graduating from the Lucy Cobb Institute, but she was denied entrance in 1869 because she was a woman. Though she rarely spoke of this rejection, it undoubtedly spurned her advocacy for women's access to higher education.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to <b>Flisch's</b> nonfiction writing and newspaper articles, she wrote fiction. In 1886, she published her first novel, Ashes of Hope, about young girls seeking independence. Her second novel, published in 1925, Old Hurricane, received good reviews.|$|R
50|$|After she was {{rejected}} from the University of Georgia, <b>Flisch</b> published letters and articles in numerous newspapers advocating for women's {{right to a}} higher education. <b>Flisch</b> mocked the superficiality of finishing schools and argued that women should receive training {{that would allow them}} to earn a living wage. In the 1920s, she led a strike that aimed to procure equal wages for women teachers.|$|E
50|$|When ground broke on Georgia Normal and Industrial College in Milledgeville, {{the first}} {{technical}} school in Georgia to accept women, <b>Flisch</b> {{gave a speech}} about women's capabilities and eagerness to learn and work. She {{was the only woman}} to participate in the dedication ceremony. She joined the college's faculty, beginning her teaching career.|$|E
5000|$|The Lucy Cobb Institute was {{the first}} school to offer <b>Flisch</b> a path in life unique to women during her lifetime, and she {{returned}} often after graduating with honors in 1877. Her speeches urged women to pursue ambitious lives, and her 1884 address was touted as [...] "the best paper ever read from that platform." ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{completing}} her master's degree, <b>Flisch</b> {{accepted a}} job in Augusta at Tubman High School, where she taught for seventeen years. She later became the first female founding faculty member at the Junior College of Augusta and a fast favorite for students. Edward J. Cashin's book A History of Augusta College proclaims, [...] "Her students were convinced that she had two brains: The story was handed from one class to the next as solemn fact and added {{a new dimension to}} the wonder which surrounded her." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{region of}} Emilia-Romagna {{consists}} of nine provinces and covers {{an area of}} 22,446 km2 (8,666 sq. mi.), ranking sixth in Italy. Nearly half of the region (48%) consists of plains while 27% is hilly and 25% mountainous. The region's section of the Apennines is marked by areas of <b>flisch,</b> badland erosion (calanques) and caves. The mountains stretch for more than 300 km from the north to the south-east, with only three peaks above 2,000 m - Monte Cimone (2,165 m), Monte Cusna (2,121 m) and Alpe di Succiso (2,017 m).|$|E
50|$|Atkinson Hall is a {{historic}} building at Georgia College in Milledgeville, Georgia. Atkinson Hall was constructed in 1896. It was saved from demolition in 1977-78 by alumni, community support, faculty, and students. The building was home to the college's J. Whitney Bunting College of Business and is named for William Y. Atkinson and his wife, Susan Cobb Milton Atkinson. Susan Atkinson was involved in advancing women's education after communicating with her journalist friend, Julia <b>Flisch.</b> Atkinson persuaded her husband, a state legislator from Coweta (and future governor), to create legislation establishing Georgia Normal & Industrial College in 1889. The building {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places on January 20, 1972.|$|E
40|$|The rock sample {{studied in}} this work has been {{collected}} at the Sulztal shear zone, a milonitic structure of regional importance which accommodated the Variscan exhumation of high-pressure units, dated at 350 - 360 Ma. The shear zone has a down-dip lineation and dips 60 - 70 ° towards S and is located South of the Sulztal which connects Längenfeld and Winnebach, nearby the Ötztal, Austria. Variscan high-P metamorphic rocks, which the sample is part of, are present throughout the Austroalpine basement of the Eastern Alps and the Ötztal-Stubai complex (ÖSC) and the Silvretta crystalline complex (SC) (Miller, 1974; Maggetti & Galetti, 1988; Maggetti & <b>Flisch,</b> 1993; Miller & Thöni, 1995; Schweinehage & Massonne, 1999; Ladenhauf et al., 2001). In the NW zone of the Ötztal unit rocks mostly preserved the pre-Alpine metamorfic overprint, namely the Variscan, in amphibolitic to eclogite facies and the associated multiple deformation. The units show only weak evidence of the Alpine mertamorfic overprint. High-pressure events are preserved most exclusively in metabasic rocks that are present in elongated lenses and bodies, like ultramafic garnet-bearing rocks (studied sample) of kilometer-scale extension, often associated with metapelitic units. Those metabasites show affinity to gabbro-basalts of mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) type (Maggetti & Galetti, 1984,Miller & Thöni, 1995). Eclogitic associations with garnet + omphacite + quartz assemblages are locally preserved within these bodies {{as a result of}} incomplete re-equilibration during exhumation subsequent to the peak of Varisan metamorphism. In rare cases, relict gabbros and gabbroic textures still indicate the nature of the protoliths (Miller, 1974, Miller & Thöni, 1995). In the north-central ÖSC, high-P rocks are present in two parallel kilometre-sized elongated bodies consisting of garnet amphibolite, eclogites and olivinerich rocks enclosed in pelitic gneisses, forming the northern and southern eclogitic zone (NEZ, SEZ) (Miller, 1974; Koziol & Oberhänsli, 1995). P-T conditions for the Variscan high-P metamorphism range from 2. 5 - 2. 9 GPa at 600 - 730 °C in the ÖSC and SC (Maggetti & Galetti, 1988; Miller & Thöni, 1995; Schweinehage & Massonne, 1999). The timing of the high-P event was determined for metabasic eclogites of the ÖSC and SC by Miller & Thöni (1995) using Sm-Nd datations. One thin section cut from an amphibolic-garnet bearing ultrafemic scist collected along the Sulztal shear zone has been studied in this thesis. It is defined as ultramafic because it consists predominantly of actinoltic amphibole (> 80...|$|E
