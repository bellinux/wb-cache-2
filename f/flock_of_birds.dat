5|$|Anonymous is {{the first}} internet-based super-consciousness. Anonymous is a group, {{in the sense that}} a <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> <b>birds</b> is a group. How do you know they’re a group? Because they’re {{travelling}} in the same direction. At any given moment, more birds could join, leave, peel off in another direction entirely.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{possible}} to teach a migration route to a <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> <b>birds,</b> for example in re-introduction schemes.

5|$|A <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> <b>birds</b> {{encountered}} the hurricane over eastern Virginia; hundreds of birds {{were killed and}} fell to the ground near Old Point Comfort, many stripped of their feathers. The outer rainbands of the storm produced heavy amounts of precipitation near Washington, D.C., canceling a baseball game between the Detroit Tigers and the Washington Senators after the field was flooded. In Ocean City, Maryland, the hurricane was considered the worst in 40years. The hurricane produced 80mph (130km/h) winds and rough waves along the Delaware Capes, indicating hurricane-force winds affected the state. It was one of only two storms on record to produce such winds in the state. Three barges and a steamer capsized in the Delaware Bay, while onshore, the winds of the hurricane destroyed the roofs of four houses in Laurel. The winds downed many trees and destroyed several chimneys near Lewes. In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, winds reached , which damaged telegraph and phone lines, knocked down several trees, and damaged the roof of Pennsylvania Railroad's Broad Street Station.|$|E

The coin was re-issued in 1933 without the sun or the birds.|$|E
25|$|Mobbing {{can also}} be used to obtain food, by driving larger birds and mammals away from a food source, or by harassing a bird with food. One bird might {{distract}} while others quickly steal food. Scavenging birds such as gulls frequently use this technique to steal food from humans nearby. A <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> <b>birds</b> might drive a powerful animal away from food. Costs of mobbing behavior include the risk of engaging with predators, as well as energy expended in the process. The black-headed gull is a species which aggressively engages intruding predators, such as carrion crows. Classic experiments on this species by Hans Kruuk involved placing hen eggs at intervals from a nesting colony, and recording the percentage of successful predation events as well as the probability of the crow being subjected to mobbing. The results showed decreasing mobbing with increased distance from the nest, which was correlated with increased predation success. Mobbing may function by reducing the predator's ability to locate nests (as a distraction) since predators cannot focus on locating eggs while they are under attack.|$|E

500|$|In an aside, {{the narrator}} tells {{the reader that}} the couple had great {{quantities}} of nuts because they never lost them, noting that most squirrels lose half their nuts because they cannot remember where they buried them. Silvertail is the most forgetful of squirrels in the wood, and, while trying to find his nuts, digs up another squirrel's hoard. A commotion erupts among the nutting squirrels, and, as ill luck would have it, a <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> <b>birds</b> fly by singing [...] "Who's bin [...] digging-up my nuts?" [...] and [...] "Little bit-a-bread and-no-cheese!" [...] One bird finds a perch in the bush where Timmy is working and continues to sing about digging up nuts. The other squirrels take notice, suspect Timmy of robbing others of their hoards, rush upon him, scratch and cuff him, chase him up a tree, and stuff him with great difficulty through the woodpecker's hole. Silvertail suggests they leave him there until he confesses.|$|E
500|$|Alongside Aladdins {{other main}} characters, Jasmine embodies the film's {{central theme of}} longing for freedom from some form of {{confinement}} or oppression. Both the film and its characters are influenced by Jasmine's [...] "power of choice". The character's desire for both freedom {{and a sense of}} agency is constantly threatened by other characters and situations; the sole decision Jasmine maintains complete agency over during the entire film is who she falls in love with – aided by the Genie's refusal to use his magical powers to force characters to fall in love – although not who she marries. Although Jasmine yearns to explore her kingdom beyond the confines of her palace, she only gets as far as the marketplace before returning home. Jasmine explores [...] "the idea that enclosing yourself behind walls can make you more vulnerable, not less", as evidenced {{by the fact that the}} character is unprepared and knows little about money when she ventures into the marketplace for first time. In the film, Jasmine releases a <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> <b>birds</b> from their cage, which serves as a metaphor for her own situation, being [...] "caged from a world she has never seen and yearns to be released." [...] Jasmine's bedroom is also shaped like a bird cage to represent her own confinement. Jasmine's story also explores themes such as civil rights, racial tolerance, social hierarchy, and Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.|$|E
