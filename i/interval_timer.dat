50|$|The Intel 8253 and 8254 are Programmable <b>Interval</b> <b>Timers</b> (PITs), which perform {{timing and}} {{counting}} functions using three 16-bit counters. They were primarily {{designed for the}} Intel 8080/8085-processors, but later used in x86-systems. They (or an equivalent circuit embedded in a larger chip) are found in all IBM PC compatibles. In PC compatibles, timer channel 0 is assigned to IRQ-0 (the highest priority hardware interrupt), channel 1 is assigned to DRAM refresh (at least in early models), and channel 2 is assigned to the PC speaker. The Intel 82c54 variant handles up to 10 MHz clock signals.|$|R

50|$|<b>Interval</b> <b>timers</b> {{are based}} on a free running, 32-bit, platform-dependent {{resolution}} timer. Such timers are normally used to specify timeouts on I/O, waiting on condition variables and other rudimentary thread scheduling. Since these timers have finite namespace and are free running, they can wrap at any time. NSPR does not provide an epoch, but expects clients to deal with that issue. The granularity of the timers is guaranteed to be between 10 microseconds and 1 millisecond. This allows a minimal timer period in of approximately 12 hours. But {{in order to deal with}} the wrap-around issue, only half that namespace may be utilized. Therefore, the minimal usable interval available from the timers is slightly less than six hours.|$|R
40|$|Animals {{have evolved}} many season-specific {{behavioural}} and physiological adaptations {{that allow them}} to both cope with and exploit the cyclic annual environment. Two classes of endogenous annual timekeeping mechanisms enable animals to track, anticipate and prepare for the seasons: a timer that measures an interval of several months and a clock that oscillates with a period of approximately a year. Here, we discuss the basic properties and biological substrates of these timekeeping mechanisms, as well as their reliance on, and encoding of environmental cues to accurately time seasonal events. While the separate classification of <b>interval</b> <b>timers</b> and circannual clocks has elucidated important differences in their underlying properties, comparative physiological investigations, especially those regarding seasonal prolactin secretions, hint at the possibility of common substrates...|$|R
5000|$|All {{physical}} routers {{acting as}} a virtual router {{must be in the}} same local area network (LAN) segment. Communication within the virtual router takes place periodically. This period can be adjusted by changing advertisement <b>interval</b> <b>timers.</b> The shorter the advertisement interval, the shorter the black hole period, though at the expense of more traffic in the network. Security is achieved by responding only to first hop packets, though other mechanisms are provided to reinforce this, particularly against local attacks. Election process is made orderly through the use of skew time, derived from a router's priority and used to reduce the chance of the thundering herd problem occurring during election. The skew time is given by the formula (256-Priority)/256 (expressed in milliseconds) RFC 3768 [...]|$|R

50|$|The DAI {{was based}} on an early 8-bit microprocessor, the Intel 8080 A, (which is {{generally}} considered the first really usable microprocessor) and contained on a single printed circuit board all the needed circuitry, some 120 individual ICs. The futuristic-looking white enclosure also held a high quality keyboard, which was uncommon for the time. As a computer display, any TV could be used. The DAI could display text and high resolution color pictures and contained a memory controller that enabled it to use up to 48 kB of DRAM. This memory was divided in three 16 kB regions (memory banks) that could contain either 4K or 16K memory chips. By using memory map switching, a total of 72kB of memory was addressable. The DAI also had five programmable interval 64µ - 16ms <b>interval</b> <b>timers</b> that could generate interrupts. The built-in interrupt handler chip could also handle two external interrupt inputs and the interrupts of two serial RS232 UARTS. The DAI featured a DAI/Indata DCE parallel I/O bus for parallel high speed I/O. The DAI also had 3 sound generators and 1 noise generator, and was capable of generating stereo sound.|$|R
