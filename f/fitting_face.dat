The methodological variability of impedance measurements using the impulse technique was found to be extremely small.

For skin segmentation, a total of 446, 007 skin samples from the training set is manually cropped from the RGB color images, to calculate three lookup tables based on the relationship between each pair of the triple components (R, G, B). Derivation of skin classifier rules from the lookup tables are based on how often each attribute value (interval) occurs, and their associated certainty values. For face detection, we assume the face-appearance as blob-like, and that the face has an approximately elliptical shape. Accordingly, an ellipse-fitting algorithm is appropriate, which is based on statistical moments, and those blobs that have an elliptical shape are retained as face candidates.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an automated technique for fitting a 2 D image to a 3 D morphable model in an Analysis-by-Synthesis fashion. The morphable model is encoded using shape and texture parameters that are recovered {{for a single}} 2 D image. The shape parameters are computed from a non-linear shape error determined by optical flow and the texture parameters are obtained from a linear texture error. The variability in illumination is accounted for by finding the linear combination of harmonic images which closely matches the input image. We obtain an initial estimate of azimuth using Support Vector Regression. The paper discusses an automatic face recognition system that is invariant to pose and illumination from an arbitrary number of lights. We describe various experiments to determine the dependence of the shape update on the weighting factor in a penalty-based function that represents the shape error and which must be minimized. We conclude that the shape parameters are not ideal for use {{as part of a}} facial similarity measure.

40|$|The impulse oscillometry system (IOS) {{which was}} {{originally}} developed for human medicine {{was found to}} be suitable for analysing respiratory mechanics in spontaneously breathing animals. This technique is non-invasive. METHODOLOGICAL ASPECTS: In order to use the IOS-technique in animals, a tightly <b>fitting</b> <b>face</b> mask is necessary. Furthermore, a flexible tube needs to be inserted into the measuring system. While the tube does not influence the measured results significantly, the face mask may affect the measurements. Therefore, its influence on the measured respiratory impedance must be taken into account. To prevent methodological errors, the head and body position of the animal should be standardised during the IOS-measurement. Since the methodological variability of the system is very small, the measuring results are highly reproducible. PHYSIOLOGICAL ASPECTS: In growing subjects, all parameters of respiratory mechanics depend on body weight. Since respiratory physiology is influenced by circadian rhythms, measurements of different days are only comparable when they have been done each day at the same hour. Comparing the respiratory impedance of different animals of similar age and body weight, a considerable inter-individual variability was observed. Due to the low level of physiological intra-individual variability, the method seems to be especially useful for studying influences on the respiratory system (i. e. pharmaceutics, therapeutics) in long-term studies using the same group of subjects.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Rates {{of fresh}} gas flow (FGF) {{commonly}} used when continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is delivered by face mask theoretically reduce the delivery {{and availability of}} therapeutic aerosols. As it may be hazardous for patients with acute respiratory failure to interrupt mask CPAP, the effects of CPAP on aerosol kinetics and bronchodilator efficacy were investigated. METHOD: The effect of CPAP at 10 cm H 2 O at a FGF rate of 50 l/min on the delivery of technetium labelled aerosol generated from a readily available jet nebuliser was measured using a bench model of spontaneous respiration. In a separate clinical study the bronchodilator responses to incremental doses of nebulised salbutamol were measured in nine stable asthmatic subjects in a random sequence of conventional nebulisation (control) or nebulisation whilst receiving CPAP via a tight <b>fitting</b> <b>face</b> mask. Each patient acted as {{his or her own}} control. RESULTS: CPAP significantly reduced total aerosol delivery to the face mask from 6. 85 (1. 52) % to 1. 3 (0. 37) % of the initial nebuliser charge. In the clinical study a significant bronchodilator response to nebulised salbutamol was seen during both conventional nebulisation and nebulisation whilst receiving CPAP by face mask. The shape of the dose-response curves and the magnitude of the total increase in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) was identical for CPAP and control conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a reduction in aerosol presented to the proximal airway, the bronchodilator response to inhaled beta 2 agonists in stable asthmatic subjects was not affected when CPAP was delivered by face mask. Despite a high rate of FGF, nebulised beta 2 agonists are effective when administered in conjunction with CPAP delivered by face mask. ...|$|E
40|$|The studies {{upon which}} this thesis is based were {{designed}} to evaluate normal fetal and neonatal adaptation {{and the effects of}} obstetrical interventions during labor and delivery on fetal and neonatal cerebral circulation. Non-invasive Doppler ultrasound was used to record blood flow velocities from the middle cerebral artery (MCA) both antenatally from the fetus, and from the newborn in the early neonatal period. Moreover, a new method of fetal surveillance, fetal pulse oximetry, was assessed in a methodological study, and in a pilot study during maternal hyperoxygenation. Neither vibroacoustic stimulation nor uterine contractions during the first stage of labor caused any changes in pulsatility index (PI) of the fetal MCA. Using a close <b>fitting</b> <b>face</b> mask with a reservoir, PI significantly increased during maternal hyperoxygenation and mean fetal oxygen saturation, recorded by pulse oximetry, increased by 12 %. Three minutes after oxygenation had stopped, fetal values returned to the pre-oxygenation level. Significant changes in PI occurred immediately after delivery. Compression and decompression of fetal head at the moment of birth might contribute to these changes. During the first hour postpartum there was a significant increase in PI, major determinants of which were changes in partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Comparing babies delivered by elective cesarean section (c. s.) versus vaginally delivered babies a significantly higher PI value was found at 1 hour in the c. s. group after delivery; no differences were found 24 hours after delivery. A new method of fetal surveillance in labor, fetal pulse oximetry, was evaluated. Of 96 oxisensors, 91 (95 %) were successfully placed and displayed the fetal arterial oxygen saturation (SpO 2).

40|$|An Active Appearance Model (AAM) is a {{variable}} shape and appearance model built from annotated training images. It {{has been largely}} used to synthesize or fit face images.

40|$|Objective: Impulse oscillometry and {{rebreathing}} technique provide two noninvasive {{options to}} assess pulmonary functions in non-sedated sheep during spontaneous breathing. The {{aim of this}} study was to examine the reproducibility and variability of several pulmonary function parameters measured with these methods and to determine whether the measurement procedures caused stress to the sheep. Therefore, selected parameters of pulmonary function as well as cortisol concentrations in the sheep’s blood were analyzed. Furthermore the influence of gestation and climatic environmental conditions on pulmonary function parameters was examined. Animals and Methods: The impulse oscillometry system ‘MasterScreen IOS’ (JAEGER, Hoechberg, Germany) was used to determine parameters of respiratory mechanics. The functional residual capacity (FRC) and the transfer factor for carbon monoxide (TLCO) were measured using the ‘MasterScreen Diffusion-System’ (JAEGER, Hoechberg, Germany). Both methods were originally developed for human medicine and were adapted to sheep using tightly <b>fitting</b> <b>face</b> masks. In both measurement systems, pneumotachography was used to determine the basic spirometric parameters, i. e. respiration frequency, tidal volume and minute ventilation. In 18 clinically healthy pregnant ewes, the pulmonary function parameters were examined over a specific period of ten weeks. In the third, eighth and ninth week of investigation the concentration of cortisol in the blood was measured. All animals were weighed once a week to determine the effect of gestation on body weight. The assessment of the climatic effect was based on climate data from the German meteorological service ‘Deutscher Wetterdienst’. Results: In general, all analyzed parameters of pulmonary function proved to be reproducible, however, there was a distinct variability. Inter-individual variability was significantly higher than intra-individual variability. On a daily basis, cortisol concentrations were significantly elevated after finishing pulmonary function tests. In the course of the investigation period, however, cortisol concentrations underwent a significant reduction indicating the effect of adaption or training. Due to pregnancy, the following parameters of pulmonary function also showed significant changes: the frequency of breathing increased, whereas the tidal volume and functional residual capacity decreased. Both respiratory resistance and reactance showed a reduction as well. There was no evidence for a climatic influence on any of the examined parameters. Conclusion: Both systems, the ‘MasterScreen IOS’ as well as the ‘MasterScreen Diffusion-System’ were found to be suitable for examining the pulmonary functions of awake sheep breathing spontaneously. Pregnancy affected some pulmonary parameters, whereas climatic environmental conditions had no significant influence on the data collected in a laboratory with defined ambient conditions. The results of the present study clearly demonstrate that pulmonary function testing in the species sheep can hardly be confined to a predictable range of values and that inter-individual variability often exceeds intra-individual variability. Consequently, it is best suited for monitoring individuals. Since the adopted methods allowed noninvasive reproducible measurements, they are strongly recommended for further diagnostic purposes in the field of veterinary medicine...|$|E

In this study, the oxygen-induced T 1 change of the lung obtained using a closed O(2) delivery system was compared with that obtained by a conventional nontight face mask. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-three healthy subjects (15 men, 8 women, mean age = 25 years, age range = 20 - 35 years) underwent oxygen-enhanced MRI of the lung using a closed O(2) delivery system composed by a tightly <b>fitting</b> <b>face</b> mask and a 60 -L reservoir bag (equipment type A: n = 13, 9 men, 4 women, mean age = 24. 4 years, age range = 20 - 32 years), or a clinically available nontight face mask (equipment type B: n = 10; 6 men, 4 women, mean age = 25. 8 years, age range = 20 - 35 years). The effect of 100 %-oxygen inhalation was assessed using a Snapshot FLASH T 1 -mapping technique (repetition time/echo time = 1. 5 - 1. 6 / 0. 56 milliseconds; matrix = 128 x 90; acquisition time = 3. 3 - 3. 7 seconds; slice thickness = 15 - 20 mm; number of images = 40). By nonlinear curve fitting, the mean T 1 values of the left and right lung at room air and 100 %-oxygen ventilation were calculated (T 1 (room air, right); T 1 (oxygen, right); T 1 (room air, left); T 1 (oxygen, left)). The average T 1 differences (DeltaT 1 = T 1 (room air) - T 1 (oxygen)) of the 2 volunteer groups were compared (Wilcoxon signed rank test, Mann-Whitney U test). RESULTS: The mean T 1 values obtained using the 2 respiratory equipments at room air or oxygen ventilation were not significantly different (A vs. B at room air ventilation: P = 0. 85 for the right lung, P = 0. 27 for the left lung; A vs. B at oxygen ventilation: P = 0. 55 for the left lung, P = 0. 29 for the right lung). With both systems, the mean T 1 values decreased significantly after oxygen inhalation (P = 0. 03 - 0. 0002). For both lungs, the DeltaT 1 obtained using the equipment type A was statistically equivalent to that obtained using the equipment type B: DeltaT 1 A, right = 96 +/- 19 milliseconds versus DeltaT 1 B, right = 97 +/- 34 milliseconds (P = 0. 82); DeltaT 1 A, left = 74 +/- 47 milliseconds versus DeltaT 1 B, left = 68 +/- 63 milliseconds (P = 0. 85).

40|$|Objective: PRRSV {{is one of}} {{the most}} causative agents in {{respiratory}} diseases in swine. This study aimed to evaluate respiratory disorders caused by PRRSV in spontaneous breathing pigs using noninvasive methods. Animals and Methods: In this negative controlled study altogether 48 German Hybrid Pigs at the age of eight weeks were included and divided into four groups. Twelve pigs were experimentally infected (intranasally and intramuscularly) with US PRRSV isolate VR 2332 (substudy 1), with EU PRRSV isolate 205817 (substudy 2), respectively, while the two control groups received physiological saline. Beside daily clinical examination of all pigs, pulmonary function tests (PFT) were performed in eight pigs per group until 18 days post infection (dpi) to evaluate i) breathing pattern, ii) respiratory mechanics, iii) diffusion of oxygen from the lung into the blood, iv) functional residual capacity and v) parameters of CO 2 -elimination. Therefore the methods impulse oscilloresistometry, rebreathing system (He, CO) and capnovolumetry (each Jaeger, Hoechberg, Germany) were applied via a tightly <b>fitting</b> <b>face</b> mask. Four pigs per group (without PFT) were sacrificed at 10 dpi and eight pigs per group (with PFT) at 21 dpi for pathological examination. Differences between groups were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test (P ≤ 0. 05). Results: Pigs infected with PRRSV developed fever, increased respiratory rates as well as cough, dyspnoea and reduced behavior accompanied of reduced appetite. Compared to controls, lung functions in pigs challenged with PRRSV were characterized by - obstructions of peripheral airways due to bronchospasms (increased respiratory resistance at frequencies ≤ 5 Hz, increased resistance of distal airways, increased ratios of the mixing volume expired between 50 and 75 % of the end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration and the inspired volume) - upper airway opening (increased respiratory resistance at frequencies ≥ 10 Hz, decreased resistance of proximal airways) - restrictions (decreased respiratory reactance) - ventilatory asynchronisms due to obstructions and restrictions (changes in morphology of the curve of the capnogram, especially increase of slope II and III of the capnogram) - development of ‚trapped air’ in pigs challenged with PRRSV-EU due to obstructions (increased functional residual capacity) - increased death space ventilation (increased ratios of dead spaces and tidal volume according to Langley, Threshold and Bohr) - deteriorations in pulmonary gas exchange (reduced transferfactor of the lung for carbon monoxide) due to interstitial pneumonia, alveolar exsudate, ‘trapped air’, disturbances in ventilation to perfusion ratio and reduced alveolar volume - fast and superficial breathing pattern (increased respiratory rate, reduced tidal volume) Pigs challenged with PRRSV isolate 205817 developed more severe clinical signs compared to pigs challenged with PRRSV isolate VR 2332. It is not ecxluded if the retrospective determined coinfection with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae had had an influence on the degree of the severty of the clinical pattern and pulmonary dysfunction. Conclusions: Acute infections with PRRSV were associated with obstructive and restrictive disorders, ventilatory asynchronisms as well as deteriorations in pulmonary gas exchange. These pulmonary dysfunctions are responsible for compensatory changes in breathing pattern and are inducing the clinical symptom dyspnoea...|$|E

When applied to different face databases and video sequences, the average face recognition rate is 95. 51 %, the average facial feature detection rate is 91. 92 % and the accuracy in location of the facial features is 2. 18 % in terms {{of the size of the}} face, which is comparable with or better than the results in literature. However, our method has the advantages of simplicity, real-time performance and extensibility to the different aspects of face analysis, such as recognition of facial expressions and talking...|$|R
40|$|In {{connection}} with design of rear <b>face</b> <b>fittings</b> for the plant-expansion study currently being conducted {{we have been}} asked to determine if rear face pressurization is required for safety reasons and if so, how much. Pressurization of the rear face piping would be used to provide sufficient reverse flow to prevent process tube burnout in the event of complete loss of coolant supply to a single tube by virtus of a front connector failure. Consideration of the effectiveness of rear face pressurization, however, requires a more general look at the problem of single tube meltdown than that provided by considering front fitting failure alone...|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} of polycrystalline manganese ferrite thin films {{have been discussed}} in previous papers. The present study was undertaken to obtain supplementary information on the magnetic anisotropy and domain {{properties of}} the films. The ferrite films were grown epitaxially by an evaporation process. An advantage of working with single-crystalline ferrite films is that studies of the domain structure are simplified. Furthermore, the magnetic anisotropy is not reduced to {{the average of the}} randomly oriented crystallites. Epitaxial growth occurs on solids with equal or related crystal structures and types of chemical bonding, having at least one crystal face of comparable structure. Well-known substrates for spinel ferrites are MgO for many orientations and sapphire (Al 2 O 3) with its (001) <b>face</b> <b>fitting</b> the (111) <b>face</b> of the spinel. In the present investigation monocrystalline MgO, with a lattice parameter of 4. 21 A, was chosen as substrate. For manganese ferrite of ideal stoichiometry lattice parameters up to 8. 50 A have been found. For the ferrite investigated, however, the fit between the lattices was not so exact. This meant that the misfit led to a compressive force in the ferrite lattice. The compression, however, was partly compensated by the occurrence of dislocations. In the special combination of MnFe 204 and MgO the coefficients of thermal expansion are practically equal (12 x 10 - 6 mm °C- 1), so that during cooling after the evaporation process little or no change in strain occurs. The strain introduced by the misfit is therefore the main source of influence, through magnetostriction, on the magnetic anisotropy...|$|R
40|$|At present, many {{approaches}} {{have been proposed}} for deformable face alignment {{with varying degrees of}} success. However, the common drawback to nearly all these approaches is the inaccurate landmark registrations. The registration errors which occur are predominantly heterogeneous (i. e. low error for some frames in a sequence and higher error for others). In this paper we propose an approach for simultaneously aligning an ensemble of deformable face images stemming from the same subject given noisy heterogeneous landmark estimates. We propose that these initial noisy landmark estimates can be used as an “anchor” in conjunction with known state-of-the-art objectives for unsupervised image ensemble alignment. Impressive alignment performance is obtained using well known deformable <b>face</b> <b>fitting</b> algorithms as “anchors...|$|R
