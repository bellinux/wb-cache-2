5|$|During the 1938 tour, McCabe {{had been}} {{generally}} unproductive and he missed {{much of the}} subsequent Australian season due to illness and only played sporadically thereafter before cricket was cancelled due to World War II.

5|$|Growing up {{as part of}} a lucha libre {{family the}} future Espanto Jr. decided he wanted to follow in the {{footsteps}} of his father and grandfather at an early age. In a 2010 interview he recalled how he would be in the front row watching his father wrestle from the time he could walk. In 1996 his father suffered an injury during a match and was briefly clinically dead while in the ring until he was revived. While the injury left a big impression on the then-10 year old he later accepted that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident</b> and tried not to think about it, but did comment that his mother still worried about him every time he competed.|$|E
5|$|Controversy arose {{regarding}} the artwork {{for the cover}} for the Classics VHS cassette when the film was first released on video when close examination of the artwork revealed an oddly shaped structure on the castle, closely resembling a human penis. Disney and the cover designer insist <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident,</b> resulting from a late night rush job to finish the cover artwork. The questionable object does not appear {{on the cover of}} the second releasing of the movie. A second allegation is that a clergyman is seen with an erection during a scene late in the film. The clergyman is a short man, dressed in Bishop's clothing, and a small bulge is slightly noticeable in a few of the frames that are actually later shown to be the stubby-legged man's knees, but the image is small and is very difficult to distinguish. The combined incidents led an Arkansas woman to file suit against The Walt Disney Company in 1995, though she dropped the suit two months later.|$|E

5|$|During an altercation on {{a crowded}} subway platform, John Lange (Vincent D'Onofrio) falls against a moving train and is pinned at waist level between a subway car and {{the edge of the}} platform. Detectives Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) arrive to {{investigate}} and are told the man's spinal cord is severed. Although Lange is not feeling much pain, emergency personnel tell the detectives he has less than an hour to live and will die as soon as he is moved. Bayliss questions Larry Biedron (Bruce MacVittie), who was involved with the altercation that led to Lange's fall. Biedron says he was bumped from behind with Lange, but witnesses give conflicting reports: Some say that Biedron pushed Lange, some that Lange pushed Biedron, and others say that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident.</b> Pembleton tries to talk to Lange, who becomes uncooperative and angry when told he will die.|$|E
5|$|Robinson married Marjorie Joseph in 1938; the {{marriage}} was annulled the same year. Their son, Ronnie Smith, was born in 1939.

According to Robinson, he met her at a local pool he frequented after his boxing workouts.

5|$|Jared {{initially}} {{tells the}} police nothing {{of what he}} saw. He is torn between the need {{to tell the truth}} and the desire to protect his friends; his anger leads to the breakdown of his relationships with both Rachel and Diane. Despite Jared's silence, police arrest Toby and the three other boys within a few days. Jared decides to tell the police what he saw, as he believes Toby and the other boys will be charged with Tracy's murder; however, on his way into the police station he is confronted by Ricko. Ricko confesses to Jared that he killed Tracy, but claims <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident</b> – that she hit her head on a rock when he attempted to have sex with her. He has already told police that he was with Jared all night and asks Jared to confirm his alibi in the name of mateship. Diane, who still {{has not been able to}} tell Jared that she has cancer due to his behaviour, goes in to have surgery.|$|E

25|$|On October 27, 1962 on {{a flight}} from Catania (Sicily) to the Milan Linate Airport, Mattei's jetplane, a Morane-Saulnier MS.760 Paris, crashed in the {{surroundings}} of the small village of Bascapè in Lombardy. The cause of the accident has been a mystery. There are strong indications that the crash {{was caused by a}} bomb hidden in the airplane. All three men on board were killed: Mattei, his pilot Irnerio Bertuzzi, and the American Time–Life Journalist William McHale. The inquiries officially declared that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident.</b> The Italian Minister of Defense, Giulio Andreotti, was responsible for the accident investigation.|$|E

According to the Israeli authorities the demolitions were carried out to eliminate weapons smuggling tunnels. According to human rights groups the demolitions were collective punishment.The exact nature of her death and the culpability of the bulldozer operator are disputed, with fellow ISM protesters saying that the Israeli soldier operating the bulldozer deliberately ran over Corrie, and Israeli eyewitnesses saying that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident</b> since the bulldozer operator could not see her.|$|E

25|$|Wooding-up was {{immediately}} ceased and the Hazelton {{pulled into the}} stream as the Mount Royal approached and they raced bow to bow. Slowly the Mount Royal gained on the Hazelton.

Bonser wagged the Hazelton’s stern at the Mount Royal, tooted the whistle and continued triumphantly upstream. Furious, Johnson left the pilothouse unattended to retrieve a rifle and shot at the departing Hazelton. Afterwards, Johnson laid charges on Bonser claiming he deliberately rammed the Mount Royal. Bonser claimed in his defense that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident.</b> The Federal Department of Marine investigated and decided that both captains were at fault, Bonser for ramming the Mount Royal, and Johnson for leaving the helm. The men were reprimanded and the case was closed.|$|E
25|$|Between June and July 2011, Pakistan Chitral Scouts {{and local}} defence militias {{suffered}} deadly cross border raids.

Afghan sources claimed that nearly 800 rounds of missiles were fired from Pakistan, hitting civilian targets inside Afghanistan. The reports claimed that attacks by Pakistan resulted in the deaths of 42 Afghan civilians, including children, wounded many others and destroyed 120 homes. Although Pakistan claims <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident</b> and just routine anti Taliban operations, some analysts believe {{that it could have been}} a show of strength by Islamabad. For example, a senior official at the Council on Foreign Relations explained that because the shelling was of large scale it is more likely to be a warning from Pakistan than an accident.|$|E
