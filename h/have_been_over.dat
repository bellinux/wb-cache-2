5|$|Despite the NASA {{prohibition}} on commercializing the medallions, since 1995 there <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>over</b> 500 internet or live auction appearances of Apollo mission Robbins medallions. Two auction companies {{account for a}} majority of the sales: Heritage Auctions (over 200 since 2007) and RR Auction (over 100 since 2011). Between both auction companies, the top 10 prices realized range from US$30,000 to nearly $62,000, all for sterling silver medallions from either Apollo 11 or Apollo 17.|$|E
5|$|In 1900 {{a massive}} {{hurricane}} devastated {{the city of}} Galveston and heavily damaged communities around the bay. According to some estimates the death toll on the coast outside of Galveston may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>over</b> one thousand. Bridges between Galveston and the mainland were destroyed. Communities along the shoreline declined for some time as economic growth moved inland and Houston became the dominant economic center in Southeast Texas. The region received a population boost from some Galveston refugees who relocated to the mainland following the catastrophe.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving his}} former label Flying Dutchman Records, Gil Scott-Heron {{signed with the}} New York City jazz-based Strata-East label in early 1973, {{accompanied}} by jazz keyboardist and songwriter Brian Jackson, {{with whom he had}} worked with on his previous studio albums, Pieces of a Man (1971) and Free Will (1972). While some sources allege this may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>over</b> financial or creative differences, Scott-Heron maintained the switch was due to producer Bob Thiele's unwillingness to give Jackson co-billing. By the time of their move to Strata-East, Scott-Heron and Jackson had achieved underground notice among R and soul music listeners, particularly for the political and social nature of their music's themes, as well as Scott-Heron's emphasis on African-American culture and social plight in his compositions. Their musical fusion of jazz, blues, soul and spoken word styles helped them earn some notice among less-mainstream black music listeners at the time.|$|E

5|$|Test cricket {{is played}} between {{international}} cricket teams who are Full Members of the International Cricket Council (ICC). Unlike One Day Internationals, Test matches consist of two innings per team, having no limit in their number of overs. Test cricket is first-class cricket, so statistics and records set in Test matches are also counted toward first-class records. The duration of Tests, currently limited to five days, has varied through Test history, ranging from {{three days to}} timeless matches. The earliest match now recognised as a Test was played between England and Australia in March 1877; since then there <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>over</b> 2,000 Tests played by 11 teams. The frequency of Tests has steadily increased {{partly because of the}} increase in the number of Test-playing countries, and partly as cricket boards seek to maximise their revenue.|$|E

Since 1995, there <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>over</b> fifty documented disease cases in North America and Europe, of which only nine have been successfully cured. Those affected are mostly young animals born in captivity, though a small number of older wild-born adults held in zoos have died, and a number of cases caused by the same pathogenic type of EEHV have been identified in both orphan and wild calves in Asian elephant populations.|$|E

5|$|The {{circumstances}} in which the Crosby Garret helmet was buried are still unclear, but the discoveries made by the post-discovery Tullie House/PAS excavations have provided much more detail about its context. It was clearly deposited within an artificial feature that had been specially constructed; Stuart Noon of the Museum of Lancashire suggests that the feature may have been intended as a memorial of some sort. It was not buried in an isolated spot but within a long-occupied Romano-British farming settlement that had clearly adopted aspects of Roman culture. Given the settlement's proximity to Roman military locations, it is very possible that some of its inhabitants served with the Roman army, which often recruited mounted auxiliaries from among native peoples. The helmet may well already have been a valuable antique {{at the time of}} its burial; if the coins found nearby reflect when it was buried, it could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>over</b> a century old by the time it was deposited. It was deliberately broken before being buried in what may have been intended as a ritual sacrifice. The identity of its owner will never be known, but it could have been that a local inhabitant who had formerly served with the Roman cavalry was responsible for the helmet's deposition.|$|E
5|$|Within {{weeks of}} the storm, the Alligator Rivers Region Advisory Committee began {{planting}} seedlings in deforested areas. By August 2006, {{a review of the}} growth of the new plants found that 81% to 88% of the seeds had survived and begun growing. To fully restore the South Alligator valley, environmentalists requested A$7.4million (US$6.6million) in funds. In a study at Magela Creek a year after the storm, it was determined that between 8% and 19% of the tree canopy lost due to the storm had begun to recover. Additional studies at the Gulungul Creek and the Alligator Rivers region revealed that suspended sediment values in flowing water had temporarily increased in the wake of Monica. The above-average values persisted for roughly a year before the streams returned to pre-cyclone sediment levels. In a study of the Arnhem forests which were devastated by the cyclone, environmentalists reported that it would take over 100years for the forest to recover. The storm's winds snapped numerous trees, estimated to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>over</b> 200 years old and more than 60cm (23.6in) in diameter. It is estimated that it would take several hundred years before trees of similar sizes would flourish in the region.|$|E
