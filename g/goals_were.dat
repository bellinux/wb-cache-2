5|$|A purely non-socialist, conservative-led {{cabinet of}} Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was {{appointed}} on 27 November. The nomination {{was both a}} long-term aim of the conservatives and a respond to the labour movements' acts during November 1917. Svinhufvud's main <b>goals</b> <b>were</b> to separate Finland from Russia, strengthen the military power of the Civil-White Guards and to return at least {{a part of the}} Parliament's new power to the Senate.|$|E
5|$|As a wanted criminal, Anarky's {{methods and}} <b>goals</b> <b>were</b> {{described}} as leaving him with little logistical support amongst the heroic community, {{or the public}} at large, relegating him to underground operation.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{scheduler}} and controller co-design for real-time control systems. The overall <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> higher resource utilization and better control performance. One <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> {{to minimize the}} performance loss due to jitter and control delays. Another <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to relax the nominal requirements on hard deadlines and fixed worst-case execution times. A third <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to provide a co-simulation environment for real-time control systems...|$|R

5|$|Only one man {{has scored}} a hat-trick in a World Cup Final. Geoff Hurst scored three for England against West Germany in the 1966 Final.

His first goal came at 10', while the second <b>goals</b> <b>were</b> in extra time at 98' and 120'.|$|E

50|$|The term goal {{may also}} {{refer to the}} {{structure}} in which <b>goals</b> <b>are</b> scored. The ice hockey <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> rectangular in shape; the front frame of the <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> made of steel tube painted red (or another color depending on the league) and consists of two vertical goalposts and a horizontal crossbar. A net {{is attached to the}} back of the frame to catch pucks that enter the goal and also to prevent pucks from entering it from behind. The entire <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> considered an inbounds area of the playing surface, and it is legal to play the puck behind the goal. Under NHL rules, the opening of the <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> 72 in wide by 48 in tall, and the footprint of the <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> 44 in deep.|$|R
50|$|On 30 August 2008 Leeds drew 2-2 with Bristol Rovers. The first <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> a Jermaine Beckford shot which {{deflected}} off Steven Elliot. The <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> originally an Elliot own <b>goal,</b> but <b>was</b> later {{awarded to}} Beckford.|$|R
5|$|The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) {{replace the}} eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which expired {{at the end}} of 2015. The MDGs were {{established}} in 2000 following the Millennium Summit of the United Nations. Adopted by the 189 United Nations member states at the time and more than twenty international organizations, these <b>goals</b> <b>were</b> advanced to help achieve the following sustainable development standards by 2015.|$|E
5|$|The children's {{television}} show Sesame Street, which premiered on public broadcasting television stations in 1969, {{was the first}} show of its kind that utilized a detailed and comprehensive educational curriculum, with specific educational goals, in its content.

5|$|The referee's {{decision}} in all on-pitch matters is considered final. The score of a match cannot be altered after the game, even if later {{evidence shows that}} decisions (including awards/non-awards of <b>goals)</b> <b>were</b> incorrect.|$|E
5000|$|Using a values {{approach}} to goal pursuit, Heath et al. (1999) assert that proximal <b>goals</b> <b>are</b> {{more likely to}} result in successful outcomes. [...] When a <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> proximal, value for each step of progress is greater than if the <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> distal given diminishing sensitivity. One way to transform a distal goal to a more proximal <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to set subgoals. Therefore, Heath et al. (1999) assert that setting subgoals is an effective strategy to motivate successful goal pursuit.|$|R
500|$|The longer {{boundary}} {{lines are}} touchlines, while the shorter boundaries (on which the <b>goals</b> <b>are</b> placed) <b>are</b> <b>goal</b> lines. A rectangular <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> positioned {{at the middle}} of each goal line. The inner edges of the vertical <b>goal</b> posts must <b>be</b> [...] apart, and the lower edge of the horizontal crossbar supported by the <b>goal</b> posts must <b>be</b> [...] above the ground. Nets are usually placed behind the <b>goal,</b> but <b>are</b> not required by the Laws.|$|R

5|$|Their {{opposition}} were Sheffield United of the First Division in the semi-final, {{which was}} held over two-legs. The first leg at United's home ground Bramall Lane saw Liverpool {{take the lead in}} the 36th minute when striker Neil Mellor scored. However, two goals in the second half from United midfielder Michael Tonge meant they won the match 2–1. The second leg was held at Liverpool's home ground, Anfield. Liverpool took the lead in the ninth minute when Diouf scored. This levelled the tie at 2–2 and as no further <b>goals</b> <b>were</b> scored upon reaching full-time, the match went into extra-time. Liverpool extended their lead in the 107th minute when striker Michael Owen scored. No further <b>goals</b> <b>were</b> scored in the remaining minutes of extra-time and Liverpool progressed to the final courtesy of a 3–2 aggregate victory.|$|E

5|$|Aston Villa {{currently}} {{hold the}} {{record number of}} league goals scored by any team in the English top flight; 128 <b>goals</b> <b>were</b> scored in the 1930–31 season, one more than Arsenal who won the league that season {{for the very first}} time, with Villa runners-up. Villa legend Archie Hunter became the first player to score in every round of the FA Cup in Villa's victorious 1887 campaign. Villa's longest unbeaten home run in the FA Cup spanned 13 years and 19 games, from 1888 to 1901.|$|E

5|$|Fowler {{featured}} {{rarely in}} his final Liverpool season, making only six league starts. Bizarrely, all three of his League <b>goals</b> <b>were</b> penalties against Sheffield United. One of these was in the away game on {{the opening day of}} the season, and the other two in the reverse fixture at Anfield. Appearances in other competitions were more common due to Rafael Benítez's squad rotation policy. On 25 October 2006 Fowler was named as Liverpool's captain {{for the first time since}} his return in a League Cup tie against Reading, scoring just before half-time in a 4–3 win.|$|E
