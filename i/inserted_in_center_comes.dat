40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the crack {{extension}} behavior in the brittle material under the compression mixed mode loadings based on the energy release rate criterion. Two initial parallel cracks were <b>inserted</b> <b>in</b> the <b>center</b> of a disc-type test-piece made of a cement paste. The compressive loads were obliquely applied to the parallel cracks. We study the influencesto the crack extension behavior by changing, the loading angle, the friction of the crack surface, the difference of length between two cracks, the distance of two parallel cracks. The energy release rate is computed for the extending crack tips {{at the onset of}} crack kinking by using the E-integral which is path independent even for a path containing a kinking crack tip. 出版者照会後に全文公...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the crack {{extension}} behavior in the brittle material under the compression mixed mode loadings.

The compressive loads were obliquely applied to the initial crack. The extension phenomena of the crack were photographed by a high-speed video camera, and the image analysis was carried out. Using the result of the image analysis, we observed the crack extension behavior in the experiment in detail. It was confirmed that the cracks first occurred from the tips of the initial crack and the secondary cracks were observed after the first cracks. The experimental results were examined using the energy release rate criterion. As a result, the relations between the fracture load in the experiment and the loading angle were found to agree well with the relations between the energy release rate by the E-integral and the loading angle.

40|$|Results of {{transverse}} {{impedance measurement}} using image current are reported. The {{results show that}} this technique can be used up to frequency of 3. 9 GHz and high Q of 3300. I. Introduction The transverse coupling impedance {{is a measure of}} the interaction between the beam and deflecting modes (TM 1 n 0) in accelerator cavities. Two-wire and bead-pull techniques are usually employed for the measurement of transverse coupling impedance. The principle of the wire technique is to insert wires into cavities and beam line components to transform them into transmission lines and measure the scattering parameters. Coupling impedances (longitudinal or transverse) are extracted from S parameters [1]. For longitudinal coupling impedance measurement, a single wire is <b>inserted</b> <b>in</b> the <b>center</b> of cavities and beam components to form a coaxial transmission line. For transverse coupling impedance, two off-center wires are inserted to form a balanced-two-wire transmission line and a 180 degree, 3 db pow [...] ...|$|R

40|$|An {{apparatus}} for non-contact maesurements of {{the electrical}} resistivity of undercooled metallic melts was developed. It combines containerless positioning by electromagnetic levitation with an inductive technique of conductivity determination. The specimen is <b>inserted</b> <b>in</b> the <b>center</b> of a measurement transformer, the mutual inductance {{of which is}} changed by the eddy currents induced. As a condition for the applicability of this method {{the expression of the}} mutual inductance change as a function of coil geometry, sample shape and electrical conductivity is derived in perturbation theory for nearly spherical samples as an expansion in bessel functions. Furthermore the technical problem of mutual inductive interactions between levitation and measuring coils is solved by use of compensation transformers and periodic interruption of the levitation current while data reading. High accuracy is attained by homogeneous measurement fields, by optimized levitation coils, by symmetric coil arrangement, precise electronics and digital data recording.
