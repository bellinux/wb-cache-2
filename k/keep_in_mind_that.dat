5|$|In {{addition}} to the evidentiary guidelines forensic anthropologists should always <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> the remains they are working with were once a person.

30|$|It {{stems from}} the {{preceding}} that superiority of albumin over normal saline has never been proved or even tested during SBP. This is not a trivial issue when one <b>keeps</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> the cost of infused albumin in protocols for SBP treatment amounts to about 300 euros for each individual patient. Given the incidence of SBP, million euros (or dollars) could be saved if normal saline proved at least as effective as albumin.|$|R

5|$|Regardless of {{the verdict}} of juries, no player that throws a ball game; no player that {{undertakes}} or promises to throw a ball game; no player that sits in a conference {{with a bunch of}} crooked players and gamblers where the ways and means of throwing ball games are planned and discussed and does not promptly tell his club about it, will ever play professional baseball. Of course, I don't know that any of these men will apply for reinstatement, but if they do, the above are at least a few of the rules that will be enforced. Just <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that,</b> regardless {{of the verdict}} of juries, baseball is competent to protect itself against crooks, {{both inside and outside the}} game.|$|E
5|$|Many {{attempts}} were made to reconstruct the exact mass of the Roman pound. One method for doing this consists in weighing old coins; another uses the fact that Roman weight units were derived from Roman units of length similarly to the way the kilogramme was originally derived from the metre, i.e. by weighing a known volume of water. Nowadays the Roman pound is often given as 327.45g, but one should <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> (apart from the other uncertainties that come with such a reconstruction) the Roman weight standard is unlikely to have remained constant to such a precision over the centuries, and that the provinces often had somewhat inexact copies of the standard. The weight and subdivision of the pound in the Holy Roman Empire was reformed by Charlemagne, but in the Byzantine Empire it remained essentially the same. Since Byzantine coins circulated up to Scandinavia, the old Roman standard continued to be influential through the Middle Ages.|$|E

25|$|<b>Keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> LDL-C {{is not a}} {{measurement}} of actual LDL particles; LDL-C is only an estimate (not measured from the individual's blood sample) of how much cholesterol is being transported by all LDL particles; either a smaller concentration of large particles or {{a high concentration of}} small particles. Also <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> LDL particles carry many fat molecules (typically 3,000 to 6,000 fat molecules per LDL particle); this includes cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids and others. Thus even if the hundreds to thousands of cholesterol molecules within an average LDL particle were measured, this does not reflect the other fat molecules or even the number of LDL particles.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> not all conserved sequences are under selection pressure.

50|$|There were {{conflicts}} when PCSL matches were rescheduled, postponing or bumping {{the other}} competitions, {{so that a}} representative side from local teams could play the PCSL game. The amount of soccer being played is especially notable when one <b>keeps</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> the same athletes often competed in baseball, boxing, rugby, basketball, lacrosse, and other pursuits in addition to soccer. The PCSL also appears to have motivated the Victoria and District Football Association to begin paying referees.

25|$|In {{the field}} of medico-criminal {{forensic}} entomology, L. mexicana {{can be used to}} determine post mortem intervals using a time of colonization on corpses because the fly is attracted to freshly killed animal carcasses. As for other fields of forensic entomology, stored product specialists should <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> although attributed to L. coeruleiviridis, an episode of contamination of drying fruit in Sacramento Valley was most likely caused by L. mexicana. More research on the insect is needed in order to efficiently use it in criminal and health cases.|$|E
25|$|Gale McGee was not {{the first}} senator to propose a summer break. In 1959 Margaret Chase Smith warned of the Senate’s {{increasing}} workload. It creates disorder, she complained, as well as “confused thinking, harmful emotions, destructive tempers, unsound and unwise legislation, and ill health with the very specter of death hanging over Members of Congress.” If that sounds dramatic, <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> in the 1950s senators died in office {{at a rate of about}} two per year. Smith proposed an annual break from August to October, but the Senate ignored her words of caution.|$|E

25|$|Management which models {{the use of}} {{articulated}} dissent {{contributes to}} the use of articulated dissent among its employees (Kassing & Avtgis, 1999). Subordinates who witness their supervisors successfully articulating dissent may be more likely and more willing to adopt similar strategies. However, a supervisor must <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> expressing dissent can be very difficult and uncomfortable for lower-level managers and employees. Therefore, supervisors should not only take actions to encourage dissent, they must be willing to seek out individuals willing to say no to them (Roberto, 2005).|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{scientific}} {{studies have found}} lateralization of emotions. FMRI and lesion studies have shown asymmetrical activation of brain regions while thinking of emotions, responding to extreme emotional stimuli, and viewing emotional situations. Processing and production of facial expressions also appear to be asymmetric in nature. Many theories of lateralization have been proposed {{and some of those}} specific to emotions. Please <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> most of the information in this article is theoretical and scientists are still trying to understand emotion and emotional lateralization. Also, some of the evidence is contradictory. Many brain regions are interconnected and the input and output of any given region may come from and go to many different regions.|$|E
25|$|Megazostrodon is {{the only}} {{well-known}} genus of the family Megazostrodontidae. The other members of this family that are currently known to science are Indozostrodon, Dinnetherium, Wareolestes and Brachyzostrodon. The megazostrodontids used to be classified {{as members of a}} group of mammals called the Triconodonts, which are thought to have evolved from a specific group of reptiles (the cynodonts or 'mammal-like reptiles’) during the late Triassic and early Jurassic periods. However, recent classifications consider the megazostrodontids to be mammaliaforms just outside the Mammalia proper, while the triconodonts remain in the (crowngroup) Mammalia. One must <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> the distinction between true mammals and mammaliaformes is purely a cladistic and phylogenetic one: mammaliaforms are mammals in every other way.|$|E

25|$|This {{notation}} {{means that}} the corresponding Slater determinants have a clear higher weight in the configuration interaction expansion. The atomic orbital concept is therefore a key concept for visualizing the excitation process associated with a given transition. For example, one can say for a given transition that it corresponds to the excitation of an electron from an occupied orbital to a given unoccupied orbital. Nevertheless, one has to <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> electrons are fermions ruled by the Pauli exclusion principle and cannot be distinguished from the other electrons in the atom. Moreover, it sometimes happens that the configuration interaction expansion converges very slowly and that one cannot speak about simple one-determinant wave function at all. This is the case when electron correlation is large.|$|E
25|$|The one {{tangible}} {{result that}} all the research continually focused on is that community-based services, such as those provided by the HCBS waiver programs, provided a higher {{quality of life for}} disabled individuals. It can also be argued that the research upholds the idea that the cost per individual was lower for those enrolled in the HCBS waiver program than for those attending institutions for similar services. The difficulty when collecting research and data for programs with fewer years of operation is concrete evidence for sufficient analysis. It is also critical to <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> the HCBS waiver program varies state by state with regard to demographics, funding, state policies, and so forth. The most effective changes come as each state analyzes the overall functionality, success, and performance of their individual HCBS waiver program.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to note that the footnotes contain numerous errors and even contradictions vis-à-vis the article text, as can be seen in the text of articles 2.311 and 2.312 and the footnote to the former. Some of these errors are attributable to the codifier, but others are likely due to circumstances beyond his control. There are instances where Vélez Sársfield reworked an entire title or modified a rule without altering the footnotes pertaining to the original edition. In this manner, for example, all the footnotes in Book IV were brought directly from the original drafts by Victorino de la Plaza without any of the pertinent modifications. That said, one should <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> during the editing of Nueva York and La Pampa many modifications from the original text were accumulated.|$|E

5|$|Earlier {{methods for}} {{measuring}} convergence incorporate ratios of phenotypic and phylogenetic distance by simulating evolution with a Brownian motion model of trait evolution along a phylogeny. More recent methods also quantify {{the strength of}} convergence. One drawback to <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> is <b>that</b> these methods can confuse long-term stasis with convergence due to phenotypic similarities. Stasis occurs when there is little evolutionary change among taxa.|$|R
