5|$|Sea anemones {{and their}} {{attendant}} anemone fish can make attractive aquarium exhibits {{and both are}} often harvested from the wild as adults or juveniles. These fishing activities significantly impact the populations of anemones and anemone fish by drastically reducing the densities of each in exploited areas. Besides their collection from the wild for use in reef aquaria, sea anemones are also threatened by alterations to their environment. Those living in shallow water coastal locations are affected directly by pollution and siltation, and indirectly by the effect these <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> photosynthetic symbionts and the prey on which they feed.|$|E
5|$|The season {{continued}} {{to focus on}} the surgical residency of five young interns as they try to balance the challenges of their competitive careers with the difficulties that determine their personal lives. It was set in the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, located in the city of Seattle, Washington. Whereas the first season put the emphasis mainly on the unexpected impact the surgical field has on the main characters, the second season provides a detailed perspective on the personal background of each character, focusing on the consequences that their decisions <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> careers. Throughout the season, new story lines were introduced, including the love triangle between Meredith Grey, Derek Shepherd, and Addison Montgomery, the main arc of the season. Also heavily developed was the story line involving Izzie Stevens' relationship with patient Denny Duquette, which resulted in critical acclaim and positive fan response.|$|E

25|$|The {{plan has}} been very controversial, {{primarily}} because it was planned to include the demolition of many residences and shops owned by the town's inhabitants.

25|$|At {{one time}} {{it was said that}} {{appearing}} as a Bond girl would damage an actress's career. Lois Chiles is often cited as a case in point, even though her career did not suffer because of her portrayal of Holly Goodhead, but rather because, after she lost her younger brother to non-Hodgkin lymphoma, she decided to take a three-year break from acting, from which her career never recovered. Casting for the female lead in Casino Royale (2006) was hindered by potential actresses' concerns about the effect that playing the role might <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> careers. At that point, some thought that the Bond series had become stale and would therefore be a less desirable vehicle for young actresses. Nevertheless, the up-and-coming actress Eva Green agreed {{to play the role of}} Vesper Lynd, and showed those fears to be unfounded when she won BAFTA's Rising Star Award for her performance. Rosamund Pike, who made her feature film debut as Miranda Frost in Die Another Day (2002), went on to earn an Academy Award Nomination for Gone Girl.|$|E

500|$|Although {{some people}} who self-harm {{do not have any}} form of {{recognised}} mental disorder, many people experiencing various forms of mental illnesses do have a higher risk of self-harm. The key areas of disorder which exhibit an increased risk include autism spectrum disorders, borderline personality disorder, bipolar disorder, depression, phobias, and conduct disorders. Schizophrenia may also be a contributing factor for self-harm. Those diagnosed with schizophrenia have a high risk of suicide, which is particularly greater in younger patients as they may not have an insight into the serious effects that the disorder can <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> lives. Substance abuse is also considered a risk factor as are some personal characteristics such as poor problem-solving skills and impulsivity. There are parallels between self-harm and MÃ¼nchausen syndrome, a psychiatric disorder in which individuals [...] illness or trauma. There may be a common ground of inner distress culminating in self-directed harm in a MÃ¼nchausen patient. However, a desire to deceive medical personnel in order to gain treatment and attention is more important in MÃ¼nchausen's than in self-harm.|$|E

500|$|The {{series has}} {{received}} positive reviews from critics. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club favorably noted its [...] "sheer and utter joyfulness" [...] {{and lack of}} cynicism, unlike many other shows that garnered a cult following of parents and adults. He complimented the characters' stylized appearance, the stories' relative complexity for children's television, and the solid jokes which make the show enjoyable for parents as well as children. He gave the series a B+. The show has been critically praised for its humor and moral outlook by Brian Truitt of USA Today. Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club later commented that Friendship Is Magic {{is an example of}} a show that, while considered [...] "girly", has been able to tap into the nerd culture to allow it to gain wider acceptance than other comparable forms. Emily Ashby of Common Sense Media, an organization focusing on the parenting aspect of children's media, gave the show a rating of four out of five stars, emphasizing its messages of friendship, tolerance and respect, but advised parents to be wary of the [...] "influence the characters might <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> kids' desires, since it's rooted in a well-known product line of books, toys, and just about everything in between." [...] Liz Ohanesian, for L.A. Weekly, said that the show is [...] "absolutely genuine in its messages about friendship but never takes itself too seriously". Matt Morgan, writing for Wireds [...] "GeekDad" [...] column, praised the show for having [...] "rebooted the long-time Hasbro property while managing to lace it with geeky undertones" [...] and being one of the few [...] "girl-focused shows that a geeky dad can appreciate with his daughter". Los Angeles Times critic Robert Lloyd called the show [...] "smarter and sassier and more aesthetically sophisticated" [...] than any of the previous My Little Pony cartoons, and praised its ability to appeal to both children and their parents, in that it is [...] "smart and sprightly and well-staged, and never horribly cute". TV Guide listed Friendship Is Magic as one of the top sixty animated shows of all time in a September 2013 list.|$|E
