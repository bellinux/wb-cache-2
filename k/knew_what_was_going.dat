5|$|By 1944, the SS-TV {{had been}} {{organized}} into three divisions: {{staff of the}} concentration camps in Germany and Austria, in the occupied territories, and of the extermination camps in Poland. By 1944, it became standard practice to rotate SS members {{in and out of}} the camps, partly based on manpower needs, but also to provide easier assignments to wounded Waffen-SS members. This rotation of personnel meant that nearly the entire SS <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on inside the concentration camps, making the entire organization liable for war crimes and crimes against humanity.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of the production, Atlus staff saw Shin Megami Tensei as a chance to create a game with the company's brand on it. The staff saw it as a remake of the {{previous}} Megami Tensei game; because of this, they <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to happen in the story, and the development went smoothly. The story went through multiple revisions, and many settings were inspired by the staff's personal lives. The character and demon designs were done by Kazuma Kaneko, who used mythical figures and multiple clothing styles in his designs. Reception and sales for the game have been highly positive, and its success helped launch Atlus as a developer and publisher, along with popularizing the Megami Tensei series.|$|E

The purveyor of anthrax may have been a former government scientist, Jewish, with a record of baiting a colleague of Arab origins, and with the intent to blame the anthrax on Muslim terrorists. Rocketing around the web and spilling into the press are many stories about Israeli spies in America at the time of 9/11.

I'm sitting on a phone booth or lying on a car, to hint that I'm dead, that I'm singing from the dead. It's all about separation.

I knew them both too well for it to be a secret for me." [...] Stannard commented about the fondness between Halliwell and Rowe: [...] "I don't {{want to get into the}} side of things.

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series creator Chris Carter and {{directed}} by Rob Bowman.

I felt extremely pressured and frustrated, although there are things in it I love, particularly the banter between Mulder and Scully. But overall, I thought the show was very oblique. I don't feel that the characters ever <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on and I don't think it is all that cool that kids are murdering people.

500|$|Originally to {{be called}} The Ends of the Earth, each episode would have ended with the planet Earth meeting its demise in a {{different}} way. While writing the first episode, Adams realised that he needed a character who <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to happen to Earth before the other characters. He made this character an alien and, remembering an idea he supposedly had had while lying drunk in a field in Innsbruck, Austria in 1971, decided that this character would be a [...] "roving reporter" [...] for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a pan-galactic encyclopedia and travel guide.

500|$|As captain, Johnson {{was noted}} for his public {{relations}} skills and his gift for public speaking. [...] He was optimistic by nature, with {{a belief in}} [...] "guts and determination". [...] However, he was seen as insensitive at times; Bill Johnston took offence when Johnson attempted to rouse him during a practise session: [...] "Just cos {{you are one of}} the old blokes in the side doesn't mean you don't have to bloody well put in you know." [...] At times his optimism could appear artless and naive. Ian Craighis successor as Australian captainwas critical of Johnson's attitude during the 1956 tour of England: [...] "I don't think [...] was ever realistic about the situation. [...] I supposed he felt obliged to make rallying speeches, but the team <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on." [...] Pat Crawford felt [...] "Johnson couldn't get anything out of the players, whereas the guys would have busted a gut for [...] ". [...] He was seen by some of his team mates as [...] "dictatorial" [...] with [...] Benaud and Harvey particularly resenting Johnson's insistence on the entire touring party attending every lead-in match before 1956 Test series in England.|$|E

500|$|Nicole's {{best friend}} during her initial storylines was Aden Jefferies (Todd Lasance). After Brendan Austin (Kain O'Keeffe) caused Roman to go blind, {{he took his}} anger out on Nicole and Aden. Subsequently they became [...] "each other's support network" [...] and Lasance {{said it was not}} long {{afterward}} that they [...] "slipped between the sheets". One of the conditions of Aden's tenancy was to never sleep with Nicole, this made the pair feel guilty that they had deceived Roman. Lasance felt the storyline was controversial as he had a strong fan base for his relationship with Belle Taylor (Jessica Tovey) - which meant he knew it would [...] "cause a stir" [...] and divide the audience. In January2010, Nicole and Aden [...] "get up close and personal" [...] and they decided to spend Aden's remaining time in the Bay together.

Members of the creative team behind Metamorphosis who returned for Hilary Duff include Charlie Midnight, John Shanks and Kara DioGuardi (who collaborated on the commercially released singles), Andre Recke, Marc Swersky and Duff's sister Haylie. Hilary said, [...] "I do have a lot to say, and I have a lot going on inside that sometimes is buried and hidden because I'm working so hard, and I don't have time to think about it.

2500|$|... "No Sanctuary" [...] {{featured}} several homages {{to various}} horror films. The episode's opening scene involved primary characters Rick Grimes, Daryl Dixon, Glenn Rhee, and Bob Stookey {{being brought to}} a slaughterhouse and lined up over a trough with other Terminus captives, who are violently hit {{over the head with}} baseball bats before their throats are slit to drain their blood. Nicotero said during an interview in the aftershow Talking Dead that the scene was inspired by the film Alien (1979), particularly the [...] "chestburster" [...] scene. [...] " [...] Ridley Scott they had blood tubes hooked up and nobody <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to happen...When they rolled six cameras and Veronica Cartwright gets hit with all the blood, all those reactions were real," [...] stated Nicotero, who also opted to use practical effects in filming and kept {{the true nature of the}} scene hidden from the actors. Another scene involved Rick's group escaping from the slaughterhouse and passing by several crates, one of which read: [...] "Arctic Expedition Horlicks University, Attn: Julia Carpenter". Nicotero, who usually inserts several Easter eggs in the episodes he directs, added this as an homage to the film Creepshow (1982) and its director, George A. Romero, who worked with Nicotero in Day of the Dead (1985).|$|E
