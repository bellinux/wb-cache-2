5|$|As noted above, the Moon's orbit is also elliptical. The Moon's {{distance}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> {{can vary}} by about 6% from its average value. Therefore, the Moon's apparent size varies with its distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth,</b> {{and it is}} this effect that leads to the difference between total and annular eclipses. The distance of the Earth from the Sun also varies during the year, but this is a smaller effect. On average, the Moon appears to be slightly smaller than the Sun as seen <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth,</b> so the majority (about 60%) of central eclipses are annular. It is only when the Moon is closer to the Earth than average (near its perigee) that a total eclipse occurs.|$|E

5|$|Clouds {{intercept}} both {{heat from}} the sun and heat radiated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth.</b> Their effects are complex and vary in time, location, and altitude. Usually during the daytime the interception of sunlight predominates, giving a cooling effect; however, at night the re-radiation of heat to the Earth slows the Earth's heat loss, this causes storms and subsequent flood rains and flooding.|$|E

5|$|Cicero {{stated the}} twins {{objection}} (that with close birth times, personal outcomes {{can be very}} different), later developed by Saint Augustine.
