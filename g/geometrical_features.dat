50|$|Parallel plate flow {{chambers}} {{are among}} the most popular flow chambers used to study the leukocyte-endothelial interaction in vitro. They have been used for investigation since the later 1980s. Although flow chambers have been an important tool to study leukocyte rolling, there are several limitations when it comes to studying the physiological in vivo conditions, as they lack correspondence with in vivo geometry, including scale/aspect ratio (microvasculature vs large vessel models), flow conditions (e.g. converging vs diverging flows at bifurcations), and require large reagent volumes (~ ml) due to their large size (height > 250 µm and width > 1mm).With the advent of microfluidic-based devices, these limitations have been overcome. A new in vitro model, called SynVivo Synthetic microvascular network (SMN) was produced by the CFD Research Corporation (CFDRC) and developed using the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) based soft-lithography process.

5000|$|Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is {{a system}} to taxonomize human facial {{movements}} by their appearance on the face, based on a system originally developed by a Swedish anatomist named Carl-Herman Hjortsjö. It was later adopted by Paul Ekman and Wallace V. Friesen, and published in 1978. Ekman, Friesen, and Joseph C. Hager published a significant update to FACS in 2002. Movements of individual facial muscles are encoded by FACS from slight different instant changes in facial appearance. It is a common standard to systematically categorize the physical expression of emotions, and it has proven useful to psychologists and to animators. Due to subjectivity and time consumption issues, FACS has been established as a computed automated system that detects faces in videos, extracts the <b>geometrical</b> <b>features</b> of the faces, and then produces temporal profiles of each facial movement.The pioneer F-M Facial Action Coding System 2.0 (F-M FACS 2.0) [...] was created in 2017 by Dr. Freitas-Magalhães, and presents 2,000 segments in 4K, using 3D technology and automatic and real-time recognition.|$|E
50|$|The orientalizing {{style was}} the product of {{cultural}} ferment in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean of the 8th and 7th centuries BC. Fostered by trade links with the city-states of Asia Minor, the artifacts of the East influenced a highly stylized yet recognizable representational art. Ivories, pottery and metalwork from the Neo-Hittite principalities of northern Syria and Phoenicia found their way to Greece, as did goods from Anatolian Urartu and Phrygia, yet there was little contact with the cultural centers of Egypt or Assyria. The new idiom developed initially in Corinth (as Proto-Corinthian) and later in Athens between 725 BC and 625 BC (as Proto-Attic). It was characterized by an expanded vocabulary of motifs: sphinx, griffin, lions, etc., as well as a repertory of non-mythological animals arranged in friezes across the belly of the vase. In these friezes, painters also began to apply lotuses or palmettes. Depictions of humans were relatively rare. Those that have been found are figures in silhouette with some incised detail, perhaps the origin of the incised silhouette figures of the black-figure period. There is sufficient detail on these figures to allow scholars to discern a number of different artists' hands. <b>Geometrical</b> <b>features</b> remained in the style called proto-Corinthian that embraced these orientalizing experiments, yet which coexisted with a conservative sub-geometric style.|$|E

40|$|Local feature {{description}} {{is a fundamental}} yet challenging task in 3 D computer vision. This paper proposes a novel descriptor, named Statistic of Deviation Angles on Subdivided Space (SDASS), for comprehensive encoding geometrical and spatial in-formation of local surface on Local Reference Axis (LRA). The SDASS descriptor is generated by one <b>geometrical</b> <b>feature</b> and two spatial features. Considering that surface normals, which are usually used for encoding geometrical information of local surface, are vulnerable to various nuisances, we propose a robust geometrical attribute, called Local Principal Axis (LPA), to replace the normals for generating the <b>geometrical</b> <b>feature</b> of our SDASS descriptor. For accurately encoding spatial information, we use two spatial features for fully encoding the spatial information of a local surface based on LRA. Besides, an improved LRA is proposed for increasing the robustness of our SDASS to noise and varying mesh resolutions. The performance of the SDASS descriptor is rigorously tested on several popular datasets. Results show that our descriptor has a high descriptiveness and strong robustness, and its performance outperform existing algorithms by a large margin. Finally, the proposed descriptor is applied to 3 D registration. The accurate result further confirms {{the effectiveness of the}} SDASS method. Comment: 14 pages, 13 figure...|$|R
