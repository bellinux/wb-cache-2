5|$|Defining {{levels of}} joint {{attention}} <b>is</b> <b>important</b> in determining if children {{are engaging in}} age-appropriate joint attention. There are three levels of joint attention: triadic, dyadic, and shared gaze.|$|E
5|$|Electricity power {{stations}} are often {{located on the}} coast or beside an estuary so that the sea {{can be used as}} a heat sink. A colder heat sink enables more efficient power generation, which <b>is</b> <b>important</b> for expensive nuclear power plants in particular.|$|E

5|$|Glyphs are {{inscribed in}} a {{vertical}} orientation, {{even if the}} object depicted (e.g. fish, Orion’s belt) is usually seen horizontally. This serves the purposes of economy and aesthetic effect. The 'vertical rule' <b>is</b> <b>important</b> for interpreting the glyphs correctly, so it may have assisted in secrecy as well.|$|E
5|$|If {{tuberculosis}} recurs, {{testing to}} determine which antibiotics it is sensitive to <b>is</b> <b>important</b> before determining treatment. If multiple drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) is detected, treatment with at least four effective antibiotics for 18 to 24months is recommended.|$|E
5|$|In mammals, this {{metabolic}} pathway <b>is</b> <b>important</b> in beta oxidation of fatty acids and catabolism of amino acids and choline, as it accepts electrons from multiple acetyl-CoA dehydrogenases.

50|$|It {{is thought}} that the two {{residues}} Glu270 and His288 <b>are</b> <b>important</b> for the enzyme's catalytic function, while the residue Arg241 is thought to <b>be</b> <b>important</b> for substrate specificity.|$|R

50|$|The battle <b>was</b> <b>important</b> {{not only}} because the American victory made it {{possible}} for them to win the Mexican-American War; it also <b>was</b> <b>important</b> because of the historical participation of the Saint Patrick's Battalion.|$|R
5|$|Income from tourism <b>is</b> <b>important</b> to Ashland's economy.

In 2011, the festival sold more than 390,000 tickets to its theater productions.|$|E
5|$|Naming {{groups of}} organisms {{in a way}} that is clear and widely agreed <b>is</b> <b>important,</b> as some {{disputes}} in paleontology have been based just on misunderstandings over names. Linnaean taxonomy is commonly used for classifying living organisms, but runs into difficulties when dealing with newly discovered organisms that are significantly different from known ones. For example: it is hard to decide at what level to place a new higher-level grouping, e.g. genus or family or order; this <b>is</b> <b>important</b> since the Linnaean rules for naming groups are tied to their levels, and hence if a group is moved to a different level it must be renamed.|$|E
5|$|Public {{attitudes and}} {{the actions of}} key {{stakeholders}} can {{play a crucial role}} in realising the potential of sustainable biofuels. Informed discussion and dialogue, based both on scientific research and an understanding of public and stakeholder views, <b>is</b> <b>important.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{adiabatic}} process has <b>been</b> <b>important</b> for thermodynamics since its early days. It <b>was</b> <b>important</b> {{in the work}} of Joule, because it provided a way of nearly directly relating quantities of heat and work.|$|R

5|$|Subsequent {{research}} {{demonstrates that}} two important skills in joint attention are following eye gaze and identifying intention. The ability to share gaze with another individual {{is an important}} skill in establishing reference. The ability to identify intention <b>is</b> <b>important</b> in a child's ability to learn language and direct the attention of others. Joint attention <b>is</b> <b>important</b> for many aspects of language development including comprehension, production and word learning. Episodes of joint attention provide children with information about their environment, allowing individuals to establish reference from spoken language and learn words. Socio-emotional development {{and the ability to}} take part in normal relationships are also influenced by joint attention abilities. The ability to establish joint attention may be negatively affected by deafness, blindness, and developmental disorders such as autism.|$|E

5|$|The {{concentrations}} of free calcium {{in the cell}} can regulate an array of reactions and <b>is</b> <b>important</b> for signal transduction in the cell. Mitochondria can transiently store calcium, a contributing process for the cell's homeostasis of calcium.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} Gyeongju is more diverse than the city's {{image as a}} tourist haven would suggest.

50|$|In {{the first}} decades of the nineteenth century, Buckfastleigh and Ashburton <b>were</b> <b>important</b> towns in the region. Ashburton <b>was</b> an <b>important</b> stannary and woollen town, while Buckfastleigh had {{established}} woollen mills as well as other manufacturing industries.

40|$|The ongoing {{global warming}} is {{especially}} pronounced in the arctic, and it <b>is</b> therefore <b>important</b> to investigate {{the effect of these}} changes on arctic ecosystems. In this study the Snow bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis) breeding in Spitsbergen, Svalbard was used as a model species to investigate how the climatic variations are affecting avian reproduction. Both big scale climatic parameters and local weather variables were included in an analysis of how these factors affected snow bunting breeding success. It turned out that both big scale and local variables <b>were</b> <b>important.</b> Locale temperature and wind <b>was</b> <b>important</b> for time off breeding. Temperature, precipitation, winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAOw) and winter Arctic Oscillation (AOw) <b>were</b> <b>important</b> for number of fledged chicks, and wind and air pressure <b>were</b> <b>important</b> for growth rate. </p...|$|R
