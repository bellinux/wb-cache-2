5000|$|Sydney Chapman gave {{a correct}} {{description}} {{of the source of}} stratospheric ozone and its ability to generate heat within the stratosphere; he also wrote that ozone may be destroyed by reacting with atomic oxygen, making two molecules of molecular oxygen. We now know that there are additional ozone loss mechanisms, and that these mechanisms are catalytic meaning that a small amount of the catalyst can destroy a great number of ozone molecules. The first is due to the reaction of hydroxyl radicals OH· with ozone. OH is formed by the reaction of electronically <b>excited</b> <b>oxygen</b> atoms produced by ozone photolysis, with water vapor. While the stratosphere is dry, additional water vapor is produced in situ by the photochemical oxidation of methane (CH4). The HO2 radical produced by the reaction of OH with O3 is recycled to OH by reaction with oxygen atoms or ozone. In addition, solar proton events can significantly effect ozone levels via Radiolysis with the subsequent formation of OH [...] Laughing gas or Nitrous oxide (N2O) is produced by biological activity at the surface and is oxidised to NO in the stratosphere; the so-called NOx radical cycles also deplete stratospheric ozone. Finally, chlorofluorocarbon molecules are photolysed in the stratosphere releasing chlorine atoms that react with ozone giving ClO and O2. The chlorine atoms are recycled when ClO reacts with O in the upper stratosphere, or when ClO reacts with itself in the chemistry of the Antarctic ozone hole. Paul J. Crutzen, Mario J. Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1995 for their work describing the formation and decomposition of stratospheric ozone.|$|E

Nonintrusive {{measurements}} of the streamwise velocity in turbulent round jets in air are performed by recording short-time displacements and distorsions of very thin tagging lines written spanwise into the flow. The lines are written by Raman <b>Exciting</b> <b>oxygen</b> molecules and are interrogated by Laser Induced Electronic Fluorescence (RELIEF). This gives access to the spatial structure of transverse velocity increments without recourse to the Taylor hypothesis. The resolution is around 25 μm, less than twice the Kolmogorov scale η for the experiments performed (with R_λ≈ 360 - 600). The technique is validated by comparison with results obtained from other techniques for lon-gitudinal or transverse structure functions up to order eight. The agreement {{is consistent with the}} estimated errors–a few percents on exponents determined by Extended-Self-Similarity–and indicates significant departures from Kolmogorov 1941 scaling. Probability distribution functions of transverse velocity increments u over separations down to 1. @η are reported for the first time.
