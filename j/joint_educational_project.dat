The aim of this paper is to propose a pedagogical model for children 2 ̆ 7 s genuine participation in architectural design, developed in an architectural education context. According to this pedagogical model, children (primary school students) and youth (university architecture students) work in teams to develop the architectural design proposals. This model was developed through a <b>joint</b> <b>educational</b> <b>project</b> between Deakin University and Wales Street Primary School (both institutions are based in Victoria, Australia). In the four-week duration of the project, first year architecture students worked with Grade 3 and 4 primary school children to design a school playground. The final product of the project was a 1 : 20 scale model of a playground, which was installed and presented at the end of the fourth week. The project received positive feedback from all the participants, including children, architecture students, university lecturers, primary school teachers and architects. In addition, it achieved a high level of children 2 ̆ 7 s genuine participation. This model can be refined and applied in new situations, and potentially with other primary schools working with Deakin University. <br /...|$|E

40|$|For the {{preparation}} of modern specialists in the acquisition and processing of three-dimensional data, a broad and detailed study of related modern methods and technologies is necessary. One of the most progressive and effective methods of acquisition and analyzing spatial data is terrestrial laser scanning. The study of methods and technologies for terrestrial laser scanning is of great importance not only for GIS specialists, but also for surveying engineers who make decisions in traditional engineering tasks (monitoring, executive surveys, etc.). The understanding and formation of the right approach in preparing new professionals {{need to develop a}} modern and variable educational program. This educational program must provide effective practical and laboratory work and the student’s coursework. The resulting knowledge of the study should form the basis for practical or research of young engineers. In 2014, the Institute of Applied Sciences (Jade University Oldenburg, Germany) and Kyiv National University of Construction and Architecture (Kiev, Ukraine) had launched a <b>joint</b> <b>educational</b> <b>project</b> for the introduction of terrestrial laser scanning technology for collection and processing of spatial data. As a result of this project practical recommendations have been developed for the organization of educational processes in the use of terrestrial laser scanning. An advanced project-oriented educational program was developed which is presented in this paper. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the program a 3 D model of the big and complex main campus of Kyiv National University of Construction and Architecture has been generated...|$|E

40|$|Children 2 ̆ 7 s {{creativity}} {{is a valuable}} resource for architectural design, and {{attempts have been made}} throughout the world to involve children in the design process of their environments. Previous children 2 ̆ 7 s co-design projects often followed a problem solving process, however, this process has limitations in stimulating children 2 ̆ 7 s creativity. Research has found that children 2 ̆ 7 s {{creativity is}} different to adult 2 ̆ 7 s creativity: Instead of creative problem solving skills, children 2 ̆ 7 s creativity is most evident in their imagination and originality of thinking. Addressing this issue, an alternative process in children 2 ̆ 7 s co-design projects was experimented: Fictional Inquiry. In this paper, two case studies are used to illustrate how the fictional inquiry process is applied in children 2 ̆ 7 s co-design projects. * These two <b>projects</b> were both <b>joint</b> <b>educational</b> <b>projects</b> between Deakin University and schools in Geelong and Melbourne. Through several weeks 2 ̆ 7 of workshops, children and university architecture students worked in small groups to develop architectural design solutions.

40|$|The {{workshop}} {{sets out}} to make a contribution to closing the gap between the world of research and society at large. This involves going beyond the persistent divide in education between the sciences and the humanities in the spirit of what E. Morin has stressed recently in Seven Complex Lessons in Education for the Future. In his essay the French philosopher and sociologist demonstrated the urgent need to acquire an overall vision of knowledge to supersede the fragmentation into specialist disciplines. On one hand, the specialist disciplines have led to the enormous progress typical of the present age, but on the other, they have hindered the organization of knowledge required to tackle consciously increasingly complex problems (especially as regards democratic participation in society), which by nature are multidisciplinary, cross-disciplinary, multidimensional, transnational and planetary. The International Year of Astronomy 2009, which marks the fourth centenary of the first telescope observation, provides a good opportunity to reconsider Galileo’s work in the framework of the culture and society of his day, but with a special focus on the issues characterizing modern relations between science and society. Besides its intrinsic interest for the epistemology and the history of science, this field of enquiry may offer a good ground for interdisciplinary projects shared by researchers and university or high-school teachers with both scientific and humanistic backgrounds. The future of the European Union will depend greatly on the upcoming generations’ capacity to develop a sense of common European citizenship in the worldwide context and to improve skills in the field of scientific and technical knowledge. In this sense the efficiency of national educational systems is a crucial factor not only for the purposes of disseminating knowledge but also for economic development and democratic life. In recent years there has been a strong international drive to renew the teaching and communication of science. The movement involves close collaboration between school teachers and university researchers on continuous well-structured <b>joint</b> <b>educational</b> <b>projects</b> that hopefully will be included in the usual curricular teaching, also with a view to providing more effective career and education guidance to young people. That is why today’s workshop is part of the Science Degrees Project, which aims at offering guidance to young people and refresher courses to teachers. As stressed in its title, the workshop – this year promoted by the ACUME 2 Network – wishes to be {{the first in a series}} of Rome meetings that contribute to exploring the Science-Society-Education relationship through various themes and from multiple perspectives. Lastly, we should like to stress how the choice of workshop venue in a building associated with Galileo’s story and the antique books exhibition organised in the Sala Monumentale of the Biblioteca Casanatense in concomitance with the workshop were aimed at highlighting the educational and scientific role of the immense Italian cultural and museum heritage as well as that of the experts working in this field.

40|$|Introduction: {{the article}} {{analyses}} {{the role of}} <b>joint</b> <b>educational</b> programmes in higher education {{as a tool of}} internationalisation in the broader context of contemporary development trends. Special attention is paid to international / transversal generic competences and to the importance of their fostering to ensure employability of university graduates. Development and implementation of these programmes, as well as problems that have to be addressed to ensure their success are given a thorough account. The paper describes best practices in the implementation of such programmes run at Lobachevsky University of Nizhniy Novgorod. Materials and Methods: general scientific methods of cognition are used to examine the research object, namely analysis, comparison and generalisation. The practical experience of Lobachevskiy University is analysed in implementing various <b>joint</b> <b>educational</b> programmes together with European universities, namely: full-time undergraduate and graduate programmes run at two universities; bachelor’s degree and specialist’s degree programmes run at LNNSU with parallel distance learning in European universities; the programme to obtain two degrees at the third level – Kandidat nauk degree and Ph. D. Results: the authors make a general conclusion that the development of <b>joint</b> <b>educational</b> programmes is {{the most effective way to}} create a unified European Higher Education Area, an important tool for implementing the principles of the Bologna process. It is proven that the general target of <b>joint</b> <b>educational</b> programmes is to improve the competitiveness of European education and ens ure its high quality.
