50|$|Néstor Kirchner, who {{belonged to}} the {{moderate}} center-left wing of Peronism (rooted in the leftist Peronist factions of the 1970s), continued Duhalde's measures (even keeping his Minister of Economy, Roberto Lavagna) and added some heterodox economics. Heavy taxes on exports have served to keep local prices of valuable commodities in check, while collecting huge revenues (especially from oil products and agricultural exports like soybeans). The restrictive monetary policy of the 1990s has become aggressively expansive; the Central Bank has injected large amounts of cash into the economy and bought dollars from the <b>free</b> <b>currency</b> market in order to accumulate reserves. The fiscal policy is also expansive; the government has raised private and public salaries by decree on several occasions, and has encouraged negotiations between {{the private sector and}} the labor movements. Inflation has again become a concern. The government has struck price-freezing agreements with certain sectors of the economy (producers of milk, some foods, natural gas, etc.) and put heavy pressure on others. Failure to comply on the part of Argentine beef producers has been met with a punitive suspension of exports, starting March 2006, intended to increase domestic supply (this was then softened to a quota system).|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "The Science of Political Economy", {{published}} in 1905, Henry George argued that because land is a scarce resource, {{it is particularly}} subject to speculation. George uses [...] "land" [...] to refer to ownership of a right to use a resource. It includes mining, water, fishing, and timber rights, road and rail rights-of way,and some patents. Today, we would add to [...] "land" [...] such items astaxi medallions, telecommunications licenses and pollution [...] "rights".Henry George followed his analysis with a remedy: eliminate all taxesexcept for a tax on land values. The [...] "single tax," [...] as it later became known, wouldinvigorate the economy by breaking up large idle holdings, making land available tothose who would use it. And it would suck {{the air out of}} speculative bubbles, dampingthe boom and bust cycle. Henry George died before the publication of the series of books, and parts of the book are nothing more than an outline, essays and lectures as noted on the cover page. He also stated that the expansion of the money supply, should be 1 percent or thereabout, to maintain healthy growth, and discourage saving, and encourage spending, and he wanted a debt <b>free</b> <b>currency.</b> (Our current currency, as of 1913 is birthed by debt).|$|E

40|$|The {{devaluation}} of the Mexican peso of 1995 along with the more recent financial crises in emerging economies are viewed as systematic outcomes of the operation of <b>free</b> <b>currency</b> markets. The hypothesis is that there exists a distortion in <b>free</b> <b>currency</b> markets that makes developing countries systematically misallocate resources. The distortion lies in "asymmetric reputation" that leads to substitution of the reserve currency for the country's soft currency in liquid asset holdings, thus making systemic devaluations inevitable. Moreover, the empirical analysis shows that currency-substitution-led endemic devaluations misallocate resources in competitive devaluation trade, as opposed to comparative advantage trade. In a case that is parallel to asymmetric information and incomplete credit markets, the appropriate policy intervention in asymmetric-reputation driven incomplete currency markets is maintaining mildly repressed exchange rates. The operational definition of "mild" is imposing restrictions on the home-grown variety of currency substitution.

40|$|Traditional {{approaches}} to the etiology of financial crises focus on the fundamentals of an economy, more specifically on the disequilibrium {{in the balance of}} payments. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to extend this ‘first generation’ literature of financial crises with a general model that focuses on the quality of a currency as a store of value for asset holding purposes – as opposed to the medium-of-exchange characteristics of a currency that enter considerations of the balance-of-payments approach. A formal model is sketched around a utility function that includes money as an asset held in both local currency and foreign exchange. Given a steady stream of money supply, asset-price considerations in a <b>free</b> <b>currency</b> market make a fixed exchange rate untenable for the local currency and lead to devaluation and to crisis. Impressionistic evidence from the recent experience of financial crises corroborates the hypothesis of currency substitution. The policy implications of the hypothesis parallel those f market incompleteness for asymmetric information, as cast within the framework of asymmetric reputation between the soft and hard currency that leads to currency substitution for asset-holding purposes...|$|E
