6000|$|... "Could not understand?" [...] {{repeated}} Toolooha, with an incredulous look, [...] "let not Chingatok say so. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> {{passes the}} lips of man which he cannot understand?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mademoiselle Crystal, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> I {{can do for}} you?--now at once, I mean? If there is, I do entreat {{you most}} earnestly to let me serve you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ser Cosimo," [...] he said, [...] "has {{pronounced}} {{this memorial}} a false and lying document. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> you, Messer Galeotto, as its author, can {{have to tell}} the Court?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How are you, Thady?" [...] he said, {{putting out}} his hand to take the young man's, which was given with {{apparent}} reluctance; [...] "how <b>are</b> you? <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> wrong, <b>that</b> Feemy <b>is</b> crying so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very good, sir," [...] Godolphin said, with a grim smile. [...] "I {{must really}} {{compliment}} you all on your fertility of resource and invention. And now, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> else <b>that</b> I {{can do for}} you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you, ma'am,' said Bitzer, knuckling his {{forehead}} again, {{in return for}} the favour of Mrs. Sparsit's improving conversation. 'Would you wish a little more hot water, ma'am, or <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> else <b>that</b> I could fetch you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, sir, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> I {{can do for}} you?" [...] he went on, {{after they}} {{returned}} to the cottage, and had both lit their pipes and seated themselves by the fire.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. H. She can't! <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> I wouldn't do for you--or haven't done? And {{to think}} that I should take this trouble over you, knowing what you are! Do you despise me for it? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have sent}} for me, Peter--I beg pardon. I was so glad when you sent. I {{would have come}} before, only I was afraid {{that you would be}} annoyed. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> we can do for you?" ...|$|E
60|$|They had not {{forborne}} {{to talk of}} Philip de Mountford's death; {{they would}} not have admitted <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> <b>there</b> <b>that</b> could not <b>be</b> discussed with perfect indifference--she, reclining against the cushions, and he in immaculate morning coat, with hair smoothly brushed, and speckless tie and linen, talking of things which meant life or death for them both.|$|R
6000|$|... "In half an hour's time, sir," [...] he said, [...] "I {{shall be}} going on {{business}} to Narrabee, our market-town here. Can I take any letters to the post for you? or <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> else <b>that</b> I {{can do in the}} town?" ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Mary stopped, and, taking fresh courage {{from her}} vantage of distance, {{asked him if}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> he wanted.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You turn so pale {{you have}} walked too far before breakfast and I dare say live {{a great way}} off and ought {{to have had a}} ride,' said Flora, 'dear dear <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> would do you good?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Breckenridge considered. [...] "Now," [...] he said slowly, [...] "I {{can guess}} what you're thinking, and, of course, it's commendable; but {{one has to}} be reasonable. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> could excite the least {{suspicion}} that Miss Torrance warned you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> I {{can do for}} you, captain? You {{know well}} that you have but to say the word and that, {{whatever}} it is, I would do it, even if I were cut to pieces the minute afterwards." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I declare {{you said}} {{something}} {{about two or three}} wives; and if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> of <b>that</b> kind true of a gentleman and a clergyman, I don't think he ought to be allowed to go about as a single gentleman. I mean as a curate. Mr Maguire is nothing to me,--nothing whatever; and I don't see why I should have been mixed up with him; but if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> of <b>that</b> sort--" ...|$|R
60|$|Never was a {{fortification}} so well defended, or assailants so {{many ways}} defeated. We were now for giving it over, and particularly I called William, and told him I could not but laugh to see us spinning out our time here for nothing; that I could not imagine what we were doing; that it was certain that the rogues that were in it were cunning to the last degree, and it would vex anybody to be so baulked by a few naked ignorant fellows; but still it was not worth our while to push it any further, nor <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> I knew of to be got by the conquest when it was made, so that I thought it high time to give it over.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> {{you wish}} to take, take it. But with you now, I suppose, money is the only {{possession}} that has any value.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{bird that}} can sing and won't sing {{must be made}} to sing, they say," [...] grumbled Tackleton. [...] "What about the owl that can't sing, and oughtn't to sing, and will sing; <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> he should be made to do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must always}} send up if {{anything}} is wanted, Mr. Greg; whenever there is any illness in the village we always keep a stock of soups and jellies, and Mrs. Cunningham is almoner in general. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> {{we can do for}} you? If so, let me know without hesitation." ...|$|E
6000|$|My {{narrative}} in [...] "The Night of Hate" [...] is admittedly a purely theoretical {{account of the}} crime. But it is closely based upon all the known facts of incidence and of character; {{and if there is}} nothing in the surviving records that will absolutely support it, neither <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> can absolutely refute it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'To be sure,' cried all the ladies. 'Do {{you suppose}} WE shouldn't {{be the first}} to speak, if <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> ought to be taken notice of?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Probably it didn't. I don't think <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> {{could make}} Mrs. Ormond tremble, {{unless it was}} the chance that Ormond would get the last word," [...] said Minver.|$|R
6000|$|... "If you haven't it?" [...] she echoed. [...] "It's {{when you}} {{say things like that}} that you're so dreadfully tiresome. As if <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> you haven't or mightn't have!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it so very dreadful?" [...] asked Ida, with a smile. [...] "You {{have told}} me that you love me. Is that a thing to be ashamed of? Must I tell you that I am glad you came to me when you were beaten, and not when you had won? <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> I should trouble myself about?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{speaking}} {{for myself and}} not for my brother," [...] Stephen replied. [...] "Men like him, who are assailed by a certain madness, are best left alone with it. That is why I came to you to bargain, if I could. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> you lack--anything which your own success and your lover, or lovers, have failed to provide for you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} not. I always thought him sane enough until to-day, {{but you can}} take it from me that either he or I ought to be in a strait-jacket. What's the matter with me, anyhow? You've lived near me for some weeks, Watson. Tell me straight, now! <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> would prevent me from making a good husband to a woman that I loved?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell me this----" [...] then speech {{seemed to}} stick in his throat. No! If <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>anything</b> in <b>that,</b> he {{preferred}} not to hear it. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> a limit! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have never}} met any one who would do as much for me as you would, Flo," [...] she said. [...] "I don't think <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> could come between us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{a candle}} and matches beside you. If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> {{you want in}} the night, call me instantly. Remember, at any hour I shall be here. I promise it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have {{prepared}} me for my exposure, and I {{thank you for that}} too. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> you require of me? Is there any claim that I can release or any charge or trouble that I can spare my husband in obtaining HIS release by certifying to the exactness of your discovery? I will write anything, here and now, that you will dictate. I am ready to do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] he said, {{with a kind}} of sad good-humor, [...] "I {{suppose it}} is {{unreasonable}} of me to expect that a young woman like you should share any opinion with an old lawyer like me. Let me only remind you that our conversation must remain strictly confidential for the present; and then let us change the subject. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> I can do for you? Are you alone in Edinburgh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Prejudice, my dear boy, prejudice. A minor sin indeed, but {{one against}} which you must struggle. But there, there, {{it is natural}} that you should not feel warmly {{about the man who}} will one day own Outram. Ah! as I said, this is all very sad, but it must be a great {{consolation}} to you to remember that when everything is settled there will be enough, so I am told, to pay your unhappy father's debts. And now, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> I can do for you or your brother?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{would rather}} {{that it should}} be left to Mr Cheekey? If <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> further <b>that</b> you can say, I should be more tender with you than he." ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Dartle {{glanced at}} me, {{as though she}} would inquire if <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> I desired to ask. As <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{something}} which had occurred to my mind, I said in reply: ...|$|R
6000|$|The Constable spoke: [...] "You ain't touched anything, ma'am? They're {{always very}} {{particular}} about that. If the doctor's right, and <b>there's</b> <b>been</b> <b>anything</b> up, <b>that's</b> {{the first thing}} they'll ask." ...|$|R
