40|$|OBJECTIVE — Hypoglycemia is {{a common}} acute {{complication}} of diabetes therapy. The GlucoWatch biographer provides frequent and automatic glucose measurements with an ad-justable low-glucose alarm. We have analyzed {{the performance of the}} biographer low-glucose alarm relative to hypoglycemia as defined by blood glucose # 3. 9 mmol/l. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — The analysis was based on 1, 091 biographer uses from four clinical trials, which generated 14, 487 paired (biographer and blood glucose) readings. RESULTS — The results show that as the low-glucose alert level of the biographer is increased, the number of true positive alerts (alarm sounds and blood glucose # 3. 9 mmol/l) and false positive alerts (alarm sounds but blood glucose. 3. 9 mmol/l) increased. When analyzed as a function of varying low-glucose alert levels, the results show receiver operator characteristic curves consistent with a highly useful diagnostic tool. Setting the alert level from 1. 1 to 1. 7 mmol/l above the level of concern is likely to optimize the trade-off between true positives and false positives for each user. When the same blood glucose data are analyzed for typical moni-toring practices (two or four measurements per day), the results show that fewer hypoglycemic events are detected than those detected with the biographer. CONCLUSIONS — The frequent and automatic nature of the biographer readings allows more effective detection of hypoglycemia than that achieved with current medical practice. Diabetes Care 24 : 881 – 885, 2001 H ypoglycemia {{is a common}} acutecomplication of diabetes therapy. The frequency of severe hypoglyce-mia has been shown to increase with more intensive treatment. Increasing the fre-quency of glucose measurements, regard-less of the technique used, makes it possible to detect a greater number of hy-poglycemic events. However, as many as seven glucose measurements per day may fail to detect hypoglycemic events (1). A device providing automatic read-ings could make frequent monitoring eas-ier and <b>enable</b> <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> to be sounded in response to glucose readings below user-selected alert levels. Such an alarm could reduce the risk of hypoglycemia, making intensive therapy safer and more accept-able for patients...|$|E
40|$|We propose <b>an</b> <b>Alarm</b> Filtering Algorithm (AFA) for {{the fault}} {{management}} of an optical network that supports multiple failures {{and works in}} the presence of passive elements, that is, network elements which may fail but never generate <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> (e. g. optical fibres). The algorithm provides a list of components whose failure explain the observed alarms. It avoids the use of failure probabilities, which are difficult to estimate, and does not need a global knowledge of the network topology. Moreover it also tolerates alarm losses and false alarms. The algorithm is tailored to the specific behaviour of the hardware components of an optical network when a failure occurs. The classification of the network components according to the alarm signals they generate <b>enables</b> <b>a</b> formalisation of the alarm-filtering problem and results in an efficient algorithm for localising the failure(s). This algorithm is applied to the WDM rings of the COBNET network (COBNET is a European ACTS project) and to a meshed optical network with the ARPA 2 topology...|$|R

40|$|Statistical {{surveillance}} is used {{to detect}} a change in a process. It might for example be a change {{of the level of}} a characteristic of an economic time series or a change of heart rate in intensive care. An alarm is triggered when there is enough evidence of a change. When surveillance is used in practice it is necessary to know the characteristics of the method, in order to know which action that is appropriate at <b>an</b> <b>alarm.</b> The average run length, the probability of <b>a</b> false <b>alarm,</b> the probability of successful detection and the predictive value of <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> are measures that are used when comparing the performance of different methods for statistical surveillance. In the first paper a detailed comparison between two important methods, the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average and the CUSUM, is made. Some consequences of using only the average run length as the measure of performance are demonstrated. Differences between the methods are discussed in regard to the measures mentioned above. The second paper is focused on the predictive value of <b>an</b> <b>alarm,</b> that is the relative frequency of motivated alarms among all alarms. The interpretation of <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> is difficult to make if the predictive value of <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> varies with time. Thus conditions for a constant predictive value of <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> are studied. The Shewhart methods and some Moving Average methods are discussed and some general differences in performance are pointed out. Three different types of Exponentially Weighted Average are discussed and some differences established. It is further stated that if a Fast Initial Response feature is added to a method, this will in general lower the level of the predictive value of <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> {{in the beginning of the}} surveillance. The increased probability of alarm in the beginning might thus be useless...|$|R

40|$|One {{main purpose}} of {{statistical}} surveillance is to detect a change in a process, often expressed as a shift from one level to another. When a sequence of decisions is made, measures, like the number of decisions {{that have to be}} taken before <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> are of interest. In many situations a shift might occur any time after the surveillance was initiated. Prior knowledge of the probability of a change, the incidence, can become crucial when a method is selected and the parameter values of the method are set. The predictive value of <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> is <b>a</b> measure of performance that takes this information into consideration and is an important tool for evaluating methods. Mostly <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> is useful only if its predictive value is large. The predictive value of <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> is the probability that a change has occurred given <b>an</b> <b>alarm.</b> In this paper it is demonstrated that the incidence in the first point has to be relatively high, or the alarm limits very wide, in order to achieve a predictive value greater than, say 0. 5. The interpretation of <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> is difficult to make if the predictive value of <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> varies with time. For the ordinary Shewhart method and a selection of Moving Average Methods it is demonstrated how the predictive value increases with time if the incidence is constant. The incidence which would give the methods a constant predictive value are determined. The methods are thus demonstrated to give easily interpreted alarms only if the values of the incidence are strongly decreasing with time. Since in most applications a constant incidence is assumed a modification of the ordinary Shewhart method is suggested. With this modification it is possible to obtain a constant predictive value in the whole range of observations or in some interesting interval...|$|R
