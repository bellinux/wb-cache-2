40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the current status}} of the Multi-Platform Application Toolkit, an extensible platform for the simple creation of <b>interactive</b> <b>multi-media</b> <b>applications</b> for connected TVs. Developing applications from scratch requires considerable resources and for this reason they are often simply too costly for single formats or shows to contemplate. The situation is exacerbated when multiple target platforms are considered, such as HbbTV and Open Web. MPAT addresses this using an approach based on WordPress, aiming to make application development affordable and sustainable while creating a new eco-system for content creators, theme and plug-in developers. With MPAT, media companies can semi-automatically author their set of customised applications that are then populated with content by the editorial staff or by linking MPAT to existing content management solutions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This article {{discusses}} {{and compares}} interaction styles in development tools for virtual environments (VE). The comparison {{relies on a}} qualitative empirical study of two development processes where a command language and a direct manipulation based tool were used to develop the same virtual environment application. The command language tool proved very flexible and facilitated an even distribution of effort and progress over time, but debugging and identification of errors was very difficult. Contrasting this, the direct manipulation tool enabled faster imple-mentation of a first prototype but did not facilitate a shorter implementation process as a whole. On {{the basis of these}} findings, the strength and weaknesses of direct manipula-tion for developing virtual environment applications are explored further through a comparison with a successful direct manipulation tool for developing <b>interactive</b> <b>multi-media</b> <b>applications.</b> The comparisons are used to identify and emphasize key requirements for virtual environment development tool interface design...|$|R

50|$|<b>Interactive</b> <b>Multi-Media.</b> While at Apple Williams {{developed}} {{an interest in}} <b>interactive</b> <b>multi-media,</b> {{and he and his}} colleague Andrew Harris created a company, Telemorphix, in order to produce it. The result was “M. Jack Steckel's 21st Century Vaudeville,” which was broadcast on San Francisco Bay Area local TV in 1992 and 1993. People at the station and viewers were asked to provide images of themselves, which were then animated primarily at the mouth: viewers phoned in to the show and could then be these characters. The action was a mix of improvisational performance and storylines which Williams created (along with secondary, non-interactive characters.) M. Jack Steckel himself—the host—was played by Andrew Harris.|$|R

40|$|High speed {{image and}} video {{processing}} {{is a key}} technology in <b>multi-media</b> <b>applications,</b> and, therefore, currently many hardware accelerators to speed up such processing are developed and used. However, {{for the next generation}} advanced <b>multi-media</b> <b>applications</b> in the next generation, such as high quality virtual reality, bidirectional visual interface, etc., the hardware accelerators can not deal with tasks involved in these applications.

40|$|Network {{heterogeneity}} {{has become}} a major issue and <b>multi-media</b> <b>applications</b> have to cope with interconnected networks consisting of many subnetworks of unevenly distributed resources. Information is transmitted in form of packets of bits over a lossy media, such that transmitted packets may get lost. In order to solve the packet lossy problem over heterogeneous networks we analyze a model in which the messages are encoded into a set of packets that are sent to the receiver. The encoding is such that the receiver is able to recover the messages without receiving the entire encoding, that is, each message can be recovered from a particular subset of packets, with cardinality {{greater than or equal to}} a threshold. In particular we prove a lower bound on the encoding length in such model when two messages are transmitted.
