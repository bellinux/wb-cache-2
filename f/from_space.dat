5|$|Daiei also {{hoped to}} find a foreign market for Warning <b>from</b> <b>Space,</b> though the company found {{difficulty}} in selling it. Nevertheless, the film played at both King Cinema in Rangoon, Burma and Tai Khoon Theatre in Sandakan, Malaysia, in 1958. The film did help Daiei achieve some success in the genre. It was passed for release, anglicized as Warning <b>from</b> <b>Space,</b> by the BBFC in the United Kingdom in 1957, {{and later in the}} United States in 1963. The film was also released as The Mysterious Satellite in some areas. It was shown in the U.S. by American International Television later in the 1960s as Warning <b>From</b> <b>Space.</b>|$|E

5|$|After {{the success}} of Toho's 1954 film Godzilla, which {{depicted}} a giant dinosaur attacking Tokyo, many Japanese film studios began to produce similar monster films, including Warning <b>from</b> <b>Space.</b> Along with other films such as Shintōhō's Terrifying Attack of the Flying Saucers and the American Forbidden Planet, Warning <b>from</b> <b>Space</b> became part of a fledgling subgenre of films based around science fiction creatures. The film also used the theme of atomic bombs that was present in many films at the time, but showed how the weapons, which devastated the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki a decade earlier, could be put to good use. Still others noted the film used another common theme of cosmic collisions {{in the style of}} earlier films such as the 1931 film End of the World, which depicted a comet {{on a collision course with}} the Earth.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we prove two theorems which {{resemble}} the classical cohomological and homological Brown representability theorems. The main {{difference is that}} our results classify contravariant functors <b>from</b> <b>spaces</b> to spaces up to weak equivalence of functors. In more detail, we show that every contravariant functor <b>from</b> <b>spaces</b> to spaces which takes coproducts to products up to homotopy, and takes homotopy pushouts to homotopy pullbacks is naturally weekly equivalent to a representable functor. The second representability theorem states: every contravariant continuous functor from the category of finite simplicial sets to simplicial sets taking homotopy pushouts to homotopy pullbacks {{is equivalent to the}} restriction of a representable functor. This theorem may be considered as a contravariant analog of Goodwillie’s classification of linear functors [15]...|$|R

5|$|Warning <b>from</b> <b>Space</b> {{influenced}} Toho's Gorath, a 1963 film which {{depicts a}} rogue planet {{on a collision}} course with Earth. The planet Paira in Warning <b>from</b> <b>Space</b> may have been an influence in the later Daiei film Gamera vs. Guiron, which features the planet Terra, another planet on the opposite of Earth's orbit. Critics have also noted plot similarities to the later Toho film Invasion of Astro-Monster, in that a friendly planet warns Japan of the atom bomb and subsequently assists in celestial defense. The Pairans' asteroidean appearance is similar to that of a later pentagrammic creation, Starro, a villain from DC Comics' Justice League.|$|E
5|$|Above the chromosphere, {{in a thin}} (about 200km) {{transition}} region, {{the temperature}} rises rapidly from around 20,000 K in the upper chromosphere to coronal temperatures closer to 1,000,000 K. The temperature increase is facilitated by the full ionization of helium in the transition region, which significantly reduces radiative cooling of the plasma. The transition region does not occur at a well-defined altitude. Rather, it forms a kind of nimbus around chromospheric features such as spicules and filaments, and is in constant, chaotic motion. The transition region is not easily visible from Earth's surface, but is readily observable <b>from</b> <b>space</b> by instruments sensitive to the extreme ultraviolet portion of the spectrum.|$|E
