25|$|The <b>grape</b> <b>berry</b> {{is made of}} skin, flesh (or pulp), and seeds. The {{seeds are}} hard and are 2 to 5% by weight of the berry. The seeds contain 25-45% water, 34-36% carbohydrates, 13-20% fat (the grape seed oil), 4-6% tannins, 4-6.5% protein, 2-4% minerals, and 1% fatty acids. Their {{contribution}} in white wine is zero since they are removed in the pressing, in addition, the pressure is insufficient to extract anything from the seed.|$|E
25|$|In the vineyard, {{nitrogen}} {{is taken}} up by the grapevine as nitrate (NO3−), ammonium or urea which gets reduced into ammonia. Through additional reactions the nitrogen is incorporated into glutamine and glutamate and eventually used in the synthesis of other amino acids and nitrogenous compounds. After harvest, the majority (around 80%) of available nitrogenous compounds found in the grapes are concentrated in the skins and seeds. These compounds get released into the must during the process of crushing and during maceration/skin contact. Even after pressing up to 80% of initial nitrogen content within each <b>grape</b> <b>berry</b> will be left behind in the pomace.|$|E
40|$|Frost events {{across the}} state have {{resulted}} in the loss of some primary buds. This will result in secondary buds breaking and eventually flowering and producing <b>grape</b> <b>berries.</b> Be aware that in vineyards where frost killed some primary buds, there will be an extended bloom period. In these vineyards, there likely will be asynchronous bloom (that is an extended period in flowering). Within these vineyards will also be <b>grape</b> <b>berries</b> of different maturities. <b>Grape</b> <b>berries</b> arising from primary buds will develop ontogenic (age related) resistance to some grape diseases well ahead of berries arising from secondary buds. This asynchronous bloom will extend the period of susceptibility of the <b>grape</b> <b>berries</b> to disease infections [...] In vineyards with asynchronous bloom, a critical management step will be timing immediate pre-bloom and post-bloom disease management programs...|$|R

25|$|Scientist have {{discovered}} {{it is possible}} to determine, to some extent, the presence of these compounds in the grape before harvest. One way is to measured with gas chromatograph-mass spectrometers. Another method is through analysis of the glycosyl-glucose assay. Through this method glycosides from the grape juice are isolated and then hydrolysized to yield glucose. The amount of glucose produced is then quantified and tabulated in results that are expressed as amount of glycosides in micromoles per liter or per <b>grape</b> <b>berry.</b> The relationship between the presence of glycosides in wine grapes and the potential for quality in the resulting wine is not exact science but this remains an area of continuing research and development.|$|E
25|$|With {{abundant}} water, a grapevine {{will produce}} shallow root systems and vigorous growths of new plant shoots. This {{can contribute to}} a large, leafy canopy and high yields of large <b>grape</b> <b>berry</b> clusters {{that may not be}} sufficiently or physiologically ripe. With insufficient water, many of the vine's important physiological structures, including photosynthesis that contributes to the development of sugars and phenolic compounds in the grape, can shut down. The key to irrigation is to provide just enough water for the plant to continuing function without encouraging vigorous growth of new shoots and shallow roots. The exact amount of water will depend on a variety of factors including how much natural rainfall can be expected as well as the water retaining and drainage properties of the soil.|$|E
25|$|In {{white wine}} production, {{pressing}} usually takes place immediately after crushing or/and before primary fermentation. In red wine production, the grapes are also crushed but pressing usually doesn't take place till after {{or near the}} end of fermentation with the time of skin contact between the juice and grapes leaching color, tannins and other phenolics from the skin. Approximately 60-70% of the available juice within the <b>grape</b> <b>berry,</b> the free-run juice, can be released by the crushing process and doesn't require the use of the press. The remaining 30-40% that comes from pressing can have higher pH levels, lower titratable acidity, potentially higher volatile acidity and higher phenolics than the free-run juice depending on the amount of pressure and tearing of the skins and will produce more astringent, bitter wine.|$|E

25|$|Within wine {{there are}} {{volatile}} and non-volatile compounds {{that contribute to}} the make up of a wine's aroma. During the fermentation and for {{the first few months of}} a wine's existence, chemical reactions among these compounds occur frequently and a wine's aroma will change more rapidly during this period than at any other point. As a wine ages and matures, changes and developments in aroma will continue to take place but at a slower and more gradual pace. Volatile aroma compounds are present in the skin and juice of a <b>grape</b> <b>berry</b> and will vary in composition according to the individual grape variety. It is theorized that the Vitis vine developed these compounds as an evolutionary tool to aid in procreation by attracting insects to assist with pollination and birds and other animals to eat the berries and disperse the seeds. The diverse spectrum of aromas associated with individual grape varieties is a reflection of the vine's adaptation to ecological conditions and competition among other plants.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the flowering process the only part that is visible is the fused cap of petals known as the calyptra. Shortly after the calyptra is shed, liberating the pollen from the anthers of the stamen. Wind and insects generally play only a small role in aiding pollination, with the process being mostly self-contained within the vine. But cross-pollination between vine species is possible as in the cases of the origins of several grape varieties like Cabernet Sauvignon (a cross pollination of Cabernet Franc and Sauvignon blanc) and Petite Sirah (a cross of Syrah and Peloursin). During the process of fertilization, the pollen fertilizes the ovary which produces seeds as the flower begins the transformation into a <b>grape</b> <b>berry,</b> encapsulating the seed. Detrimental weather (cold, wind & rain) can severely affect the flowering process, causing many flowers not to be fertilized and produce a group. It is during this time when the buds that will become next years crops begin to form.|$|E
25|$|Pinot gris is a Pinot color sport (and {{can arise}} by {{mutation}} of Pinot noir or Pinot blanc), presumably representing a somatic mutation {{in either the}} VvMYBA1 or VvMYBA2 genes that control <b>grape</b> <b>berry</b> color. Pinot blanc is a further mutation and can either naturally arise from or give rise to Pinot gris or Pinot noir; the mutation–reversion path is multi-directional therefore. The general DNA profiles of both Pinot gris and blanc are identical to Pinot noir; and other Pinots, Pinot moure and Pinot teinturier, are also genetically similarly close. It should be noted therefore that almost any given Pinot (of whatever berry color) can occur as a complete mutation or as a chimera of almost any other Pinot As such, suggestions that Pinot noir is the fundamental and original form of the Pinots are both misleading and highly tendentious. Indeed, if anything, Pinot blanc may be the original human-selected form of Pinot, although given the genetic variability of this longstanding genetic line, thinking of Pinot as a familial cluster of grapes sharing a fundamental and common genetic core is almost certainly nearest the truth. It is this 'core' around which the sub-varietally identifying color variations (blanc, rouge, noir, gris, rose, violet, tenteurier, moure, etc.) occur, along with the more striking chimeric morphological mutation that is Pinot Meunier, and the interesting further mutations of this variety as Pinot Meunier gris and as the non-hairy mutation which the Germans classify as 'Samtrot' (effectively 'Pinot red velvet').|$|E

The primary host plant in both areas is grape (Vitis spp.), both wild and cultivated variations, though documentation of P. viteana on other host plants, including sassafras and blackberry, exists.

2500|$|Depending on temperatures, 40–80 {{days after}} bud break {{the process of}} {{flowering}} begins with small flower clusters appearing on {{the tips of the}} young shoots looking like buttons. Flowering occurs when average daily temperatures stay between 1520°C (5968°F) which in the Northern Hemisphere wine regions is generally around May and for the Southern Hemisphere regions around November. A few weeks after the initial clusters appear, the flowers start to grow in size with individual flowers becoming observable. It is during this stage of flowering that the pollination and fertilization of the grapevine takes place with the resulting product being a <b>grape</b> <b>berry,</b> containing 1-4 seeds.|$|E
2500|$|The {{stage of}} fruit set follows {{flowering}} almost immediately, when the fertilized flower begins {{to develop a}} seed and <b>grape</b> <b>berry</b> to protect the seed. In the Northern Hemisphere, this normally takes place in May and in the Southern Hemisphere in November. This stage is very critical for wine production since it determines the potential crop yield. Not every flower on the vine gets fertilized, with the unfertilized flowers eventually falling off the vine. The percentage of fertilized flowers averages around 30 but can get as high as 60 or be much lower. Climate {{and the health of}} the vine play an important role with low humidity, high temperatures and water stress having the potential of severely reducing the amount flowers that get fertilized. Coulure occurs when there is an imbalance of carbohydrate levels in the vine tissues and some berries fail to set or simply fall off the bunch. Varieties like Grenache and Malbec are prone to this abnormal fruit set. Millerandage occurs when some fertilized flowers do not form seeds but only small berry clusters. <b>Grape</b> <b>berry</b> size depends on the number of seeds so berries with no seeds will be significantly smaller than berries containing seeds. On one cluster there may be berries of various sizes which can create problems during winemaking due to the varying [...] "skin to pulp" [...] ratio among the grapes. This can be caused by vine disease, such as fanleaf, or by a boron deficiency in the vine. Gewürztraminer and the Chardonnay clones IA and Mendoza are both prone to millerandage.|$|E
2500|$|Flavan-3-ols (catechins) are {{flavonoids}} {{that contribute}} to the construction of various tannins and contribute to the perception of bitterness in wine. They are found in highest concentrations in grape seeds but are also in the skin and stems. Catechins {{play a role in the}} microbial defense of the <b>grape</b> <b>berry,</b> being produced in higher concentrations by the grape vines when it is being attacked by grape diseases such as downy mildew. Because of that grape vines in cool, damp climates produce catechins at high levels than vines in dry, hot climates. Together with anthocyanins and tannins they increase the stability of a wines color-meaning that a wine will be able to maintain its coloring for a longer period of time. The amount of catechins present varies among grape varieties with varietals like Pinot noir having high concentrations while Merlot and especially Syrah have very low levels.|$|E

The most efficient transformation occurred when the co-cultivation was done with 104 conidia due to higher frequency of resistance colonies (894 per 104 conidia) and lower background obtained. To confirm the presence of the hph gene in hygromycin resistant colonies, 20 putative transformants were screened by PCR analysis. The hph gene was identified in all the transformants. Variation on the expression levels of the eGFP was detected among the transformants and 50 % of them appeared bright green fluorescent under the microscope.
