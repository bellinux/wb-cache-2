5|$|The {{changes were}} met with {{critical}} reception in the province. Many students are now required to pay higher sports <b>fees</b> <b>to</b> cover higher transportation costs.

5|$|Hugh de Lacy died childless around 1115, and Henry I gave Ludlow Castle {{and most}} of the {{surrounding}} estates to Hugh's niece, Sybil, marrying her to Pain fitzJohn, one of his household staff.

Pain died in 1137 fighting the Welsh, triggering a struggle for the inheritance of the castle. Robert fitzMiles, who had been planning to marry Pain's daughter, laid claim to it, as did Gilbert de Lacy, Roger de Lacy's son. By now, King Stephen had seized the English throne, but his position was insecure and he therefore gave Ludlow to fitzMiles in 1137, in exchange for promises of future political support.|$|E

Later that year the Oregon legislature resolved the technical issue in the statute and the state high court admitted Leonard into the state bar.|$|E

5|$|Joyce {{had begun}} his {{education}} at Clongowes Wood College, a Jesuit boarding school near Clane, County Kildare, in 1888 {{but had to}} leave in 1892 when his father could no longer pay the fees. Joyce then studied at home and briefly at the Christian Brothers O'Connell School on North Richmond Street, Dublin, before he was offered {{a place in the}} Jesuits' Dublin school, Belvedere College, in 1893. This came about because of a chance meeting his father had with a Jesuit priest who knew the family and Joyce was given a reduction in <b>fees</b> <b>to</b> attend Belvedere. In 1895, Joyce, now aged 13, was elected to join the Sodality of Our Lady by his peers at Belvedere. The philosophy of Thomas Aquinas continued to have a strong influence on him for most of his life.|$|E
5|$|Many {{commentators}} {{suggested that}} the 2012 rise in tuition fees in England would put poorer students off applying to university. However, the {{gap between rich and}} poor students has slightly narrowed (from 30.5% in 2010 to 29.8% in 2013) since the introduction of the higher fees. This may be because universities have used tuition <b>fees</b> <b>to</b> invest in bursaries and outreach schemes. In 2016, The Guardian noted that the number of disadvantaged students applying to university had increased by 72% from 2006 to 2015, a bigger rise than in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. It wrote that most of the gap between richer and poorer students tends to open up between Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 4 (i.e. at secondary school), rather than when applying for university, and so the money raised from tuition fees should be spent there instead.|$|E
