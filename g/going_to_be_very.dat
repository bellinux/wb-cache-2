Keating was an imposing 6 feet 5inches, a natural leader and co-captain of the team with Lagaly. Of Keating, Lagaly said, [...] "You could tell even then he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> successful. He was very ambitious. Whatever he did, he did all the way." [...] Keating followed this by swimming for Cincinnati Gym, finishing second to future Olympic gold medalist Joseph Verdeur in the 220-yard breaststroke at the April 1946 national AAU championships.|$|E

500|$|The Silver Samurai, {{rendered}} by Weta Digital, {{was based}} on a model that had been 3D printed and chrome painted using electrolysis. Stunt performer Shane Rangi, wearing a motion capture suit, stood on stilts while filming as the Silver Samurai. Rangi's performance was then used to animate the digital character. Hill said the main challenge was creating the Silver Samurai's highly reflective surface, [...] "He's pretty much chrome. We were worried {{that he was going to}} look incredibly digital and that it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> hard to make him look solid and real and not just like a mirrored surface." ...|$|E

This album isn't {{just going to be}} a compilation of songs, but a classic body of work." [...] The album only contained three guest features with Drake, Gucci Mane and Soulja Boy Tell 'Em. Songz wanted to keep the amount of features very limited, and stated that [...] "anybody else I add is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> special". American rapper Fabolous was added as a guest feature on the track, titled [...] "Say Aah".|$|E
500|$|Whitaker next {{appeared}} {{in what has}} been called one of the worst films ever made, the 2000 production of Battlefield Earth, based on the novel of the same name by L. Ron Hubbard. The film was widely criticized as a notorious commercial and critical disaster. However, Whitaker's performance was lauded by the film's director, Roger Christian, who commented that, [...] "Everybody's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> surprised" [...] by Whitaker, who [...] "found this huge voice and laugh." [...] Battlefield Earth won seven Razzie Awards; Whitaker was nominated for Worst Supporting Actor, but lost to his co-star, Barry Pepper.

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{executive}} producer Frank Spotnitz and {{was intended as a}} morality tale. Spotnitz made sure that the episode had an explicit purpose and reason, and he noted, [...] "If you're going to depart from literal reality as most of us know—if you're going to go into supernatural—as a writer {{you have to ask yourself}} 'Why? ... And if you don't really have a point or reason, your story's probably not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> good." [...] Despite largely being concerned with a [...] "Monster-of-the-Week", [...] "The Gift" [...] also fits in the series' overarching mythology. The Complete X-Files book, released in 2008, considers the episode part of the overall myth arc, however, it was not included on the 2005 DVD release The X-Files Mythology, Volume 4 – Super Soldiers.|$|E

[...] In August 2009, Columbia Pictures hired screenwriters Adam Fierro and Glen Mazzara to write the sequel, and the studio plans to bring back the producing team from the original film. [...] Charlize Theron confirmed that she would reprise her role, and Berg said to expect a third actor to star as another figure with powers like Smith's and Theron's characters.|$|E

Reprising {{her role as}} Doctor Beverly Crusher, Gates McFadden said that [...] "Shooting Star Trek and getting paid {{to do it is}} great. But what's actually changed my life the most is travelling around and...being a tiny little part of this huge mythology that has changed people's lives, in many ways for the better." [...] Marina Sirtis appeared once more as Counselor Deanna Troi. She was positive about the film, saying [...] "we've been involved with this for eleven years, we've done 179 episodes, three movies, and there are still surprises. There are more layers in this movie, it's not as black and white.

On {{the topic of}} O'Malley's longtime crush on Meredith in the second season, Knight said: [...] "What's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> interesting to see is what he's {{going to do with}} Meredith. It's getting close to time. Whatever he chooses to do will inform who he is the rest of his life." [...] After their sexual encounter occurred onscreen, Knight {{said in an interview with}} Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune: [...] "George wasn't really paying full attention. He was letting his own feelings override his respect for Meredith. A person really clued in would get that there wasn't anything coming back, but he was so in his head about it and caught up in his own feelings that he wasn't listening. It's not just that he loves her...it's a kind of selfish love he had for her." [...] He also added that, [...] "I think George has a lot of growing up to do. Part of that is making horrible, stupid mistakes. He's been pretty sheltered." ...|$|E

500|$|Following Meddle in 1971, Pink Floyd {{assembled}} for {{an upcoming}} tour of Britain, Japan and the United States in December of that year. Rehearsing in Broadhurst Gardens in London, there was the looming prospect of a new album, although their priority {{at that time was}} the creation of new material. In a band meeting at drummer Nick Mason's home in Camden, bassist Roger Waters proposed that a new album could form part of the tour. Waters' idea was for an album that dealt with things that [...] "make people mad", focusing on the pressures faced by the band during their arduous lifestyle, and dealing with the apparent mental problems suffered by former band member Syd Barrett. The band had explored a similar idea with 1969's The Man and The Journey. In an interview for Rolling Stone, guitarist David Gilmour said: [...] "I think we all thought – and Roger definitely thought – {{that a lot of the}} lyrics that we had been using were a little too indirect. There was definitely a feeling that the words were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> clear and specific." ...|$|E
500|$|Scott {{chose not}} to show the full Alien {{for most of the}} film, keeping most of its body in shadow {{in order to create a}} sense of terror and heighten suspense. The {{audience}} could thus project their own fears into imagining what the rest of the creature might look like: [...] "Every movement is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> slow, very graceful, and the Alien will alter shape so you never really know exactly what he looks like." [...] The Alien has been referred to as [...] "one of the most iconic movie monsters in film history", and its biomechanical appearance and sexual overtones have been frequently noted. Roger Ebert remarked that [...] "Alien uses a tricky device to keep the alien fresh throughout the movie: It evolves the nature and appearance of the creature, so we never know quite what it looks like or what it can do...The first time we get a good look at the alien, as it bursts from the chest of poor Kane (John Hurt). It is unmistakably phallic in shape, and the critic Tim Dirks mentions its 'open, dripping vaginal mouth.|$|E
500|$|The NBA {{revised the}} {{schedule}} to play two preseason games and a 66-game regular season schedule per team {{rather than the}} standard seven preseason games and an 82-game regular season schedule. Teams were allowed to contact players' agents on November 30. Players could begin working out voluntarily at team facilities with trainers on December 1, but coaches and general managers {{were not allowed to}} observe the workouts nor could any drills be conducted. NBA teams began talking to free agents on December 5, 2011 at 10 a.m. EST. Training camps and free agency started on December 9 with the regular season beginning on Christmas Day with five games, two more than the original schedule. ESPN/ABC analyst Jeff Van Gundy said about the NBA opening on Christmas Day: [...] "It's a different opening day than has ever happened in the past and Christmas Day games have always been a big day for the NBA. This unique situation combined with the unveiling of a championship banner for the Mavericks in a finals rematch, and then to see the Lakers and the debut of Mike Brown as head coach, those things are all <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> compelling." ...|$|E

500|$|Jack and Helen were {{initiated}} into the Agape Lodge, the renamed Church of Thelema, in February 1941. Parsons adopted the Thelemic motto of Thelema Obtenteum Proedero Amoris Nuptiae, a Latin mistranslation of [...] "The establishment of Thelema through {{the rituals of}} love". The initials of this motto spelled out T.O.P.A.N., also serving as the declaration [...] "To Pan". Commenting on Parsons' errors of translation, in jest Crowley said that [...] "the motto which you mention is couched in a language beyond my powers of understanding". Parsons also adopted the Thelemic title Frater T.O.P.A.N—with T.O.P.A.N represented in Kabbalistic numerology as 210the name with which he frequently signed letters to occult associates—while Helen became known as Soror Grimaud. Smith wrote to Crowley saying that Parsons was [...] "a really excellent man... He has an excellent mind and much better intellect than myself... JP is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> valuable". Wolfe wrote to German O.T.O. representative Karl Germer that Parsons was [...] "an A1 man... Crowleyesque in attainment {{as a matter of}} fact", and mooted Parsons as a potential successor to Crowley as Outer Head of the Order. Crowley concurred with such assessments, informing Smith that Parsons [...] "is the most valued member of the whole Order, with no exception!" ...|$|E
500|$|Waugh {{worked on}} the Pinfold novel {{intermittently}} {{during the next two}} years. After his return from Jamaica he set the book aside, confining his writing to journalism and occasional prefaces—"neat little literary jobs". There is no mention of Pinfold in his diary or in letters. Waugh's biographer Martin Stannard describes Waugh at this time as physically lazy, unable to harness his still considerable mental energies—the diary entry for 12 July 1955 notes the pattern of his days: [...] "the morning post, the newspaper, the crossword, gin". Waugh's longstanding feud with the Beaverbrook press preoccupied him, particularly after an uninvited visit to Piers Court by the Daily Express journalist Nancy Spain in June, that left Waugh [...] "tremulous with rage". In March 1956 Spain attacked Waugh in an Express article, after which he began a libel action against her and her paper. Meanwhile, preparations for his daughter Teresa's coming-out ball provided a further hindrance to progress on the novel. It is not until 11 September 1956 that his diary records: [...] "I have resumed work on Pinfold". Soon after, he was writing 1,000 words a day—on 26 September he told his friend Ann Fleming that [...] "the mad book is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> funny I believe". A week later he asked his friend Daphne Fielding for permission to dedicate the book to her.|$|E
500|$|When {{it became}} clear that Foster would skip Hannibal, the {{production}} team considered several different actresses, including Cate Blanchett, Angelina Jolie, Gillian Anderson, Hilary Swank, Ashley Judd, Helen Hunt and Julianne Moore. Hopkins asked his agent if he had any [...] "power" [...] over casting. He informed De Laurentiis that he knew Moore, with whom he had worked on Surviving Picasso, and thought her a [...] "terrific actress". Although Hopkins' agent told him he had no contractual influence on casting, Scott thought it correct to discuss who would be Hopkins' [...] "leading lady". Scott said he was [...] "really surprised to find that [...] had five of the top actresses in Hollywood wanting it." [...] Moore would eventually secure the part. Scott said his decision was swayed in favor of Moore because: [...] "She is a true chameleon. She can be a lunatic in Magnolia, a vamp in An Ideal Husband, a porn star in Boogie Nights and a romantic in The End of the Affair." [...] "Julianne Moore, once Jodie decided to pass, was always top of my list," [...] said Scott on his female lead. Moore talked about stepping into a role made famous by another actress: [...] "The new Clarice would be very different. Of course people are going to compare my interpretation with that of Jodie Foster's... but this film is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> different." ...|$|E
