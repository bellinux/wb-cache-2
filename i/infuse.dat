5|$|After his {{two and a}} {{half years}} of training, Naruto returns to Konoha and begins to deal more {{actively}} with the Akatsuki threat by saving Gaara from their clutches. To fight them, Naruto trains with Kakashi to <b>infuse</b> the Rasengan with his own wind-element chakra, creating the Rasen-Shuriken attack that proves instrumental in the downfall of the Akatsuki member Kakuzu. Despite being targeted by the Akatsuki, Naruto dedicates himself to finding and retrieving Sasuke; he eventually disposes of Orochimaru and starts acting on his vengeance-driven whims. Over time, though resisting the urge to use the creature's power, the Nine Tails's influence over him expands to the point where he begins to lose his rationality as more chakra manifests in the form of tails to the point the Tailed Beast can take control of his body. This ultimately causes him to go on a rampage, destroying everything in his path.|$|E

Ignoring Athena's warnings, Kratos joins the Spartan army in an attack on Rhodes, during which a giant eagle suddenly drains him of his powers and animates the Colossus of Rhodes. While battling the statue, Zeus offers Kratos the Blade of Olympus in order to defeat it, requiring Kratos to <b>infuse</b> the blade with {{the remainder of his}} godly power. Although now human, Kratos defeats the Colossus but is mortally wounded. The eagle reveals itself to have been Zeus all along, who states he was forced to intervene as Athena refused to do so. Zeus then grants Kratos a final opportunity to be loyal to the gods, but Kratos refuses. Zeus kills him with the blade and destroys the Spartan army.|$|E
5|$|Seeing all the singers, {{you really}} {{come face to}} face with a lot of people that are {{predominantly}} younger. That's inspiring, because they come up to you and they're such big fans and they share with you what song touched them the most and how they had to learn every single ad lib and dissect it. As a vocalist it brought me back to, 'Yeah, that's what I used to do to my Whitney Houston record and my Mariah Carey record and my Etta James record.' It brings you back to a place where it becomes your personal responsibility to <b>infuse</b> the next generation with more information about learning every intricate note.

40|$|Four adult Corriedale sheep {{were used}} in an {{experiment}} divided into three parts. In part 1 a primed continuous infusion of [6, 6 - 2 H 2]glucose was <b>infused</b> for 7 h. The first 3 h was the control period, from 3 to 7 h glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) was <b>infused,</b> and from 5 to 7 h somatostatin was <b>infused.</b> Part 2 of the experiment {{was the same as}} for part 1 except that insulin was <b>infused</b> between 3 h and 7 h and GIP was <b>infused</b> between 5 and 7 h. Coincident with the insulin infusion, normal glucose was also <b>infused</b> at a variable rate {{in order to keep the}} plasma glucose at basal levels. In part 3 of the experiment [6, 6 - 2 H 2]glucose was <b>infused</b> for 5 h and somatostatin was <b>infused</b> between 3 and 5 h. Measurements of glucose turnover were made in the last 40 min of the control, GIP only, insulin only, somatostatin only, GIP plus somatostatin and GIP plus insulin infusion periods. Plasma insulin levels were reduced to the limit of detection by the somatostatin infusion; under such conditions whole-body glucose uptake should be entirely non-insulin-mediated (NIMGU). Expressing glucose disposal as glucose metabolic clearance rate demonstrated that elevated, but still physiological GIP levels had no effect on NIMGU but significantly increased insulin-mediated glucose uptake when plasma insulin levels were similar to levels typically observed after a meal. These results indicate that in sheep, GIP may enhance insulin action with respect to glucose disposal following a meal, but has no effect on glucose disposal pathways not responsive to insulin.

25|$|The goal of islet {{transplantation}} is to <b>infuse</b> enough islets {{to control}} the blood glucose level removing the need for insulin injections.

Because good control of blood glucose can slow or prevent the progression of complications associated with diabetes, such as nerve or eye damage, a successful transplant may {{reduce the risk of}} these complications. But a transplant recipient will need to take immunosuppressive drugs that stop the immune system from rejecting the transplanted islets.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the absence}} of {{contemporary}} culinary utensils such as the refrigerator, gas stovetops and ovens, the Indigenous resorted to other means to prepare their food. Upon bringing back hunted game meat, the Aborigines would preserve the meat with either millet wine or salt. Another cooking technique involved the heating up of stones by fire, which are then placed inside a vessel with other certain meats and seafood, which are cooked from the heat of the stones. Foods were mostly prepared by steaming, boiling or roasting, in order to <b>infuse</b> flavours together, yet preserve the original flavours. This again is contrasted with the Han, who adopted skills like stir-frying and stewing. Meat was also put on a bamboo spit and cooked over the fire.|$|E
25|$|Goldwater seriously {{considered}} retirement in 1980 {{before deciding to}} run for reelection. Peggy Goldwater reportedly hoped that her husband's Senate term, due to end in January 1981, would be his last. Goldwater decided to run, planning to make the term his last in the Senate. Goldwater faced a surprisingly tough battle for reelection. He was viewed by some as out of touch and vulnerable for several reasons; most importantly, because {{he had planned to}} retire in 1981, Goldwater had not visited many areas of Arizona outside of Phoenix and Tucson. He was also challenged by a formidable opponent, Bill Schulz, a former Republican turned Democrat and a wealthy real estate developer. Schulz was able to <b>infuse</b> massive amounts of money into the campaign from his own fortune.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Utilization of {{intravenously}} administered o-methionine {{was measured}} in mor-bidly obese subjects fed parenterally after elective gastric bypass surgery. Five patients were <b>infused</b> with a 25 % glucose- 4. 25 % amino acid solution containing DL-methiomne, and four were treated with a 25 % glucose- 3. 5 % amino acid solution containing only L-methionine. Mean (± SD) total daily methionine excretion was 0. 06 ± 0. 04 mmoles (of 28 ± 4 mmoles <b>infused)</b> in patients treated with the L-methionine containing solution, and was 15. 2 ± 4. 2 mmoles/day (of 45. 2 ± 5 mmoles DL-isother <b>infused)</b> in patients treated with the DL-methionine containing solution. In these latter patients, 90 to 98 % of the excreted methionine was the 1) -isomer. The data indicate 64 ± 23 % of <b>infused</b> r-metbionine is excreted in the urine. Four patients excreted between 70 to 85 % of <b>infused</b> D-methionine in the urine, but one patient excreted only 35 to 55 %, suggesting better utilization.

40|$|The {{current study}} was {{designed}} to examine the acute effects of intravenous propionate infusion on plasma hormones and metabolites and the expression of adipose tissue lipogenic genes. Four yearling rams were assigned to two groups (saline or propionate infusion) in a crossover design. All sheep were cannulated in both jugular veins and <b>infused</b> with 1. 2 M propionate at a rate of 64 mmol/min/kg BW for 30 min. Blood samples were collected at – 10, 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60 and 120 min after initiation of propionate infusion. Subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies were obtained from the tail head at 0 and 2 hr after propionate infusion and analyzed for gene expressions of uncoupling protein- 2 (UCP 2), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FAS), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor g (PPARg) and leptin using a non-isotopic ribonuclease pro-tection assay. Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations abruptly increased 5 min after beginning propionate infusion and further increased up until 30 min. Plasma glucose and insulin concentration increased in propionate <b>infused</b> sheep but not in saline <b>infused</b> sheep (P< 0. 05).
