500|$|Hill {{repeatedly}} tells a {{story from}} when she was 14 years old and bouldering in Joshua Tree: she succeeded on a route when a man came over and commented how surprised he was that she could do the route because even he could not. [...] "I thought, well, why would you expect that you automatically could do it? Just because I was a small girl, was I {{not to be able}} to do it? It was a memorable experience because it occurred to me then that other people had a different view of what I should or shouldn't be capable of doing. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> should just do whatever they can do or want to do. It shouldn't be a matter of if they're a man or a woman. It shouldn't be a matter of one's sex." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked by}} Beck for his opinion on [...] "Muslim extremists", Ellison replied, [...] "They're {{criminal}}s. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> who commit criminal acts {{should be treated}} like criminals, regardless of their faith." [...] Ellison has also said, [...] "Osama bin Laden no more represents Islam than Timothy McVeigh represented Christianity." [...] Asked about the incident later, Ellison dismissed it, saying, [...] "It's just shock TV. Some pundits {{think they have to}} ask the most outrageous questions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Governor General Michaëlle Jean {{stated that}} [...] "what is {{happening}} right now {{is part of the}} possibilities in our democratic system and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> can be reassured that, as I turn to what is happening, I am myself looking at my constitutional duties." [...] Jean was faced with three possible outcomes {{as a result of her}} planned meeting with the prime minister on December 4, 2008: dissolving parliament, proroguing parliament, or asking him to resign and inviting the opposition parties to form a government.|$|E
50|$|But, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{there are}} <b>people</b> who can handle it, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> for the <b>people</b> who can handle it, it's OK. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> there's {{anything}} wrong with it. <b>I</b> just <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> um, {{when it comes to}} the point where the pain of using the things are too great than the pain of not using them, then you have to stop.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the same}} context, {{there will be}} a council of the isles. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> some <b>people</b> are calling it IONA - the islands of the north Atlantic, from which England, by definition, will be excluded.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Jack, I fancy {{she could}} have plenty after her, for she's the prettiest and best girl o' the place; but you see, you are always about wi' her, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> most <b>people</b> <b>think</b> {{it will be a}} match some day." ...|$|R
2500|$|Jemison began {{dancing at}} the age of 11. [...] "I love dancing! I took all kinds of dance — African dancing, ballet, jazz, modern — even Japanese dancing. I wanted to become a {{professional}} dancer," [...] said Jemison. At the age of 14, she auditioned for the leading role of [...] "Maria" [...] in West Side Story. She did not get the part but Jemison's dancing skills did get her into the line up as a background dancer. [...] "I had a problem with the singing but I danced and acted pretty well enough for them to choose me. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> sometimes limit themselves and so rob themselves of the opportunity to realise their dreams. For me, I love the sciences and I also love the arts," [...] says Jemison. [...] "I saw the theatre as an outlet for this passion and so I decided to pursue this dream." [...] Later during her senior year in college, she was trying to decide whether to go to New York to medical school or become a professional dancer. Her mother told her, [...] "You can always dance if you're a doctor, but you can't doctor if you're a dancer." ...|$|E
2500|$|The show's other {{prominent}} pairing, Nathan and Haley, {{emerged as a}} supercouple. James Lafferty, Nathan's portrayer, said, [...] "I think Nathan and Haley... Well Schwahn always says that he had that sort of as an 'ace in the hole' the entire time. As he was writing the pilot script, he was planning on doing that, he really didn't know how it would pan out or what would happen. But, the fans have responded so passionately towards it, and I'm not really sure why." [...] However, Lafferty has said {{that there is a}} genuine relationship between Nathan and Haley: [...] "It started as something sort of based on betrayal and deceit. It then kind of transgressed over into something based on actual true love. So, I think that it's a transition that the fans really bought into, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> really enjoy to watch." [...] Schwahn called the couple [...] "gold" [...] and said, [...] "I love Nathan and Haley, and most of our audience does as well." [...] He explained that Nathan and Haley's fan base is strong because they have always been the most stable couple on the show, admitting that it confuses him when people ask when he is going to let them be happy. [...] "They have a lot of obstacles come their way," [...] said Schwahn, [...] "but I see them growing– especially with the jump [...] ahead and aging them a little bit– I see them growing into some really great places, not only as individuals, but as a family." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes;--I am a Conservative because I {{was born}} one. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> in {{politics}} should remain {{as they are}} born,--unless they are very wise indeed. When men come to be statesmen {{and all that kind}} of thing, of course they can change backwards and forwards." ...|$|E
25|$|Wu Zhipu {{claims he}} can move 30 billion cubic metres; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> 30,000 people will die. Zeng Xisheng {{has said that}} he will move 20 billion cubic metres, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> 20,000 <b>people</b> will die. Weiqing only {{promises}} 600 million cubic metres, maybe nobody will die.|$|R
5000|$|Anthony Curtis of the Las Vegas Advisor {{opined that}} while The Reserve had good bargain deals, it {{suffered}} from a bad location and a [...] "strange theme," [...] saying, [...] "The jungle theme was always dark and brooding, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> turned <b>people</b> off a bit." [...] The Reserve also faced competition from the nearby Sunset Station hotel and casino.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it was true. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{there was}} a great flood, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> some <b>people</b> did escape, and that they saved their beasts, just as we should try to save Nigger and the Monkstown cocks and hens if we were flooded out. Then they were able to start again when the waters went down, and they were {{naturally}} very grateful to God for their escape." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It seems to," [...] {{answered}} Glascow. [...] "I {{sleep until}} about noon, and then I {{have the rest}} of the day, until seven o'clock, to myself. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> who work at night can make a more satisfactory use of their own time than those who work in the daytime. In the summer I can take a trip on the river, or go somewhere out of town, every day, if I like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{not quite}} decided yet, sir. As far as I am myself concerned, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> {{are a great}} deal too prudent about money, I believe I could live as a married man on a hundred a year, if I had no more; and as for London, I don't see why London should be more {{expensive}} than any other place. You can get {{exactly what you want}} in London, and make your halfpence go farther there than anywhere else." ...|$|E
60|$|This was {{an extreme}} case, and perhaps such a venture might not always turn out so happily; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> might oftener trust {{themselves}} to Providence {{in these matters}} than they do. There is really an infinite variety of pleasant resorts of all kinds now, and one could quite safely {{leave it to the}} man in the ticket-office where one should go, and check one's baggage accordingly. I think the chances of an agreeable summer would be as good in that way as in making a hard-and- fast choice of a certain place and sticking to it. My own experience is that in these things chance makes a very good choice for one, as it does in most non-moral things.|$|E
5000|$|Paisley caused further {{controversy}} in May 2007 when, {{in an interview}} with journalist Jason O'Toole in Hot Press magazine, he said that [...] "I am pretty repulsed by gay and lesbianism. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it is wrong. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> those <b>people</b> harm themselves and - without caring about it - harm society. That doesn't mean to say that I hate them - I mean, I hate what they do." ...|$|R
5000|$|When Wright's {{comments}} were aired {{in the national}} media, Obama distanced himself from them, saying to Charles Gibson of ABC News, [...] "It's as if we took the five dumbest things that I've ever said or you've ever said in our lives and compressed them and put them out there — <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people's</b> reaction would, understandably, be upset." [...] At the same time, Obama stated that [...] "words that degrade individuals {{have no place in}} our public dialogue, whether it's on the campaign stump or in the pulpit. In sum, I reject outright the statements by Rev. Wright that are at issue." [...] Obama later added, [...] "Had the reverend not retired, and had he not acknowledged that what he had said had deeply offended people and were inappropriate and mischaracterized what I believe is the greatness of this country, for all its flaws, then I wouldn't have felt as comfortable staying at the church." ...|$|R
5000|$|The song is one {{of three}} tracks on Pet Sounds where Brian is the only Beach Boy performing. On the line [...] "Listen to my heart...beat", Brian stated: [...] "I felt very deeply about that line. One of the sweetest songs I ever sang. I have to say I'm proud of it. The innocence of youth in my voice, of being young and childlike. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> what <b>people</b> liked." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] she {{answered}} simply, [...] "because I must. Oh! whatever we may hear about each other, {{we may be}} quite certain that we still love each other--because we must--and all your heaven and hell cannot make any difference, no, not if they were both to join forces and try their best. But {{that does not mean}} that necessarily we shall marry each other, for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> who love like that rarely do marry, because, you see, they would be too happy, which something is always trying to prevent. It may mean, however," [...] she added reflectively, [...] "that we shall not marry anybody else, though even that might happen in your case--not in mine. Always remember, Godfrey, that I shall never marry anybody else, not even if you took three wives one after the other." ...|$|E
6000|$|Before dark, {{we had to}} go below, for {{the captain}} said he didn't want any of us to roll overboard, and, besides, the spray from the high waves made the deck very wet and unpleasant. None of us liked it below. There was no place to sit but in the long saloon, where the dining-tables were, and after supper we all sat there and read. Mr. Chipperton had a lot of novels, and we each took one. But it wasn't much fun. I couldn't get {{interested}} in my story,--at least, not in the beginning of it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> who want to use up time when they are travelling ought to take what Rectus called a [...] "begun" [...] novel along with them. He had got on pretty well in his book while he was in Nassau, and so just took it up now and went right along.|$|E
5000|$|... "I've {{always thought}} that there shouldn't be any limit {{to the things that}} are well designed. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> who {{consider}} that art should only be kept for art galleries and doesn't have a role in public life, I think that's too narrow." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{will tell}} you now, first off, I'm Christian, and my career is {{evidence}} of God in my life, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> most <b>people</b> are already thinking that Gaga and the blasphemy and they're premeditating the approach and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they'll be very shocked {{to find out how}} huge and really groundbreaking the message is and how freeing the message is for all the right reasons. And it's really going to shock the world." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I don't {{think this}} is a very real movie," [...] said Hill. [...] "But at the same time, it's quite real once you {{understand}} where you are, once you're kind of `over there.' But not everybody can get over there. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the <b>people</b> <b>that</b> can't get over there, you're not terribly interested in, anyway. Which is probably not the attitude of the marketplace, but [...] [...] [...] there are some movies you make for different reasons, you know?" ...|$|R
500|$|... "There's a {{delay in}} the screen above me, so {{if you listen to}} the music and watch the screen, they don't sync up. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> confuses <b>people.</b> But I'm singing every song. I'm singing my ass off. [...] There are times during the show, when I'm dancing so much, where I get out of breath, and we have a signal where I'm dying and they'll help me out. Believe me, I'd give {{anything}} to do a show where I just sit there and sing".|$|R
5000|$|... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> {{should have}} {{democratic}} {{control over the}} profits that they produce. It is not real democracy until you have that.

5000|$|... "To {{speak the}} truth, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> {{ought to be}} upset, and if I had a paper I would upset them all the time; I think that life is so {{important}} and, in its workings, so upsetting that nobody should be spared." [...] (Letter to Stephen Spender, December 1955.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Stephanopoulos was {{introduced}} to transcendental meditation by Jerry Seinfeld. Conducting an interview on Good Morning America, he said, “We’re all here because we all have something in common—we all practice Transcendental Meditation. … <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> don’t really understand {{exactly what it is}} and what a difference it has made in people’s lives.” ...|$|E
5000|$|... “I think I’m {{the playwright}} or the director, {{and not the}} actor. And the actors need to be onstage, not the director. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it’s absurd <b>that</b> <b>people</b> who do what I do become as important, as celebrated, as {{the ones who are}} running.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Well, that's a {{judgment}} {{that you are}} making.

5000|$|On {{the same}} day, Derek Fildebrandt {{came out as}} the first Wildrose MLA to openly support a merger with the PC Party when he told a radio station, [...] "Frankly, I've heard enough. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> are pretty clear. They want a single {{conservative}} option to face against the NDP in the next election." ...|$|E
5000|$|The lyrics also {{refer to}} Butler's {{idea that it}} is {{impossible}} to completely hide one's secrets. [...] "A lot of people have idea that there are aspects of your life that are hidden or secret … But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> are pretty much open book." [...] He adds that the song can be interpreted politically, as current political figures have been accused of acting with hidden motives.|$|E
5000|$|The {{realistic}} {{approach to the}} series included the costume design for Oliver's vigilante persona, created by Colleen Atwood. According to Amell, {{it was important for}} the suit to be functional, and the best way that he knew for that was if he could put the costume on by himself: [...] "If I can put it on by myself, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> will buy it. And that was our idea. That's our world." ...|$|E
2500|$|Populist {{politicians}} Geert Wilders and Jan Roos {{were the}} only ones reacting positively. Wilders wrote on Twitter [...] "A historic victory! A revolution." [...] He added that: [...] "We also will give our country back {{to the people of the}} Netherlands." [...] The day after the election, Wilders stated that [...] "America regained its national sovereignty, its identity. It reclaimed its own democracy, that’s why I called it a revolution.

5000|$|Tom Hiddleston as James Conrad, {{a broken}} but noble former British Special Air Service Captain {{who served in}} the Vietnam War with the Special Air Service Regiment, hired as a hunter-tracker for the {{expedition}} by Randa. Hiddleston described his character as a man who holds [...] "no political allegiance in the conflict" [...] but [...] "understands conflict", further stating, [...] "He’s a former soldier who has been formed by an understanding of war, but his specific skill set is something that's attached to the power of nature; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> something <b>people</b> haven’t seen in a long time".|$|R
