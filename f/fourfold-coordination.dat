A fivefold-coordinated environment was confirmed for the Li atoms in the empty octahedral sites in titanate (orthorhombic) LixTiO 2 structures. For the low Li concentration structures (anatase) a <b>fourfold-coordination</b> was found for the Li atoms, The energy barrier to move a Li atom from one octahedral site to a neighboring one is found to converge for value higher than 0. 5 0. 6 cV. The barrier used to calculate the hopping rate was found to decrease with increasing Li concentration. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
