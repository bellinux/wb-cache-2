He later meets with Jill Tuck at her clinic and takes control of the games, and is given five envelopes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>box</b> left to her in John Kramer's will, each containing photos of people to be tested. After he leaves, a flashback reveals that John brought Amanda Young to Jill, who had deemed her a lost cause, as proof of his methods. A later flashback, as Jill delivers a package <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>box</b> to {{the hospital}}, shows that Jill met with John at the plant hours before his death, where he gave her the box's key and his promise that she would be protected when the games ended.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} was a King of the Mountain {{match for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship with Kevin Nash as Special Guest Ringside Enforcer between then-champion Samoa Joe and the challengers Booker T, Christian Cage, Rhino, and Robert Roode. In a King of the Mountain match, the {{objective}} is to climb a ladder and hang the championship belt on a hook above the ring. In order to do so, a wrestler must first qualify by either pinning or making another wrestler submit in the match. A wrestler who is pinned or made to submit is this placed in a penalty box for two minutes. The match is fought under no disqualification rules. Booker T was the first to qualify by pinning Rhino after slamming him back-first into the mat with his signature Book End maneuver. Rhino was this placed in the penalty box. Roode was the next to qualify after bashing a ladder Cage held with a chair into him and following with a pin. Immediately afterwards, Rhino pinned Roode with a roll-up pin to qualify. Later, Joe held Booker T in his signature Coquina Clutch submission hold when Cage ascended a padded turnbuckle and jumped off onto Booker T and Joe. He followed by pinning Booker T to qualify and send Booker T to the penalty box. When Booker T was released <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>box,</b> he attacked Nash with the title belt and then attempted to hang it. Nash stopped him and then dropped Booker T back-first against the mat with his signature Jackknife Powerbomb maneuver. Joe was the last to qualify by pinning Roode after slamming him back and neck-first into the mat with his signature Muscle Buster maneuver. Joe then hung the title belt at 19 minutes and 49 seconds to win the competition.|$|E

Bertolucci presented the cricket's container as a magic black box that opens up the memories of Puyi. According to Bruce Sklarew, the cricket, mysteriously emerging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>box,</b> carries at least three meanings: it is the metaphor of Puyi himself, it is the metaphor of his wisdom acquired through suffering, and a symbol of the ultimate freedom that comes with death.|$|E

Another new source claimed that the mastermind of the Ashura blast was arrested 10 days before the attack by the police. The source also claims that police had managed to hide the arrest and the knowledge thereof.

25|$|Operant conditioning, {{sometimes}} called instrumental learning, was first extensively studied by Edward L. Thorndike (1874–1949), who observed {{the behavior of}} cats trying to escape from home-made puzzle boxes. A cat could escape <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>box</b> by a simple response such as pulling a cord or pushing a pole, but when first constrained the cats {{took a long time}} to get out. With repeated trials ineffective responses occurred less frequently and successful responses occurred more frequently, so the cats escaped more and more quickly. Thorndike generalized this finding in his law of effect, which states that behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated. In short, some consequences strengthen behavior and some consequences weaken behavior. By plotting escape time against trial number Thorndike produced the first known animal learning curves through this procedure.|$|E
25|$|The premiere {{was given}} at the Königliches Hof- und National-Theater, Munich, on June 21, 1868. The {{production}} was sponsored by Ludwig II of Bavaria and the conductor was Hans von Bülow. Franz Strauss, {{the father of the}} composer Richard Strauss played the French horn at the premiere, despite his often-expressed dislike of Wagner, who was present at many of the rehearsals. Wagner's frequent interruptions and digressions made rehearsals a very long-winded affair. After one 5 hour rehearsal, Franz Strauss led a strike by the orchestra, saying that he could not play any more. Despite these problems, the premiere was a triumph, and the opera was hailed as one of Wagner's most successful works. At {{the end of the first}} performance, the audience called for Wagner, who appeared at the front of the Royal box, which he had been sharing with King Ludwig. Wagner bowed to the crowd, breaking court protocol, which dictated that only the monarch could address an audience <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>box.</b>|$|E

25|$|Among {{the ghosts}} they {{encounter}} are Shiragiku, a young shrine maiden whose sacrifice has preserved {{her as an}} undying spirit: and Kyozo Kururugi, a man who initially went to die on the mountain but developed an insane fear of the shrine maidens due to their mind-reading powers, killing many maidens and priests before committing suicide. Many of those Kururugi slew became ghosts in their own right. The central story revolves around Ouse Kurosawa, whose near-death experience had left her with sixth sense abilities. Because of this, she became a shrine maiden and was eventually chosen to be a special Eternal Flower who would act as a powerful force pacifying Yomi. Prior to the ritual, her photograph was taken by Kunihiko Asou, creator of the Camera Obscura. They fell in love, and {{when the time came}} for the ritual, Ouse's feelings for Kunihiko and the feelings of the shrine maidens murdered by Kururugi caused the ritual to fail. The power overflowed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>box</b> and Ouse became a hostile spirit that corrupted all the spirits of the mountain.|$|E

25|$|Set {{off from}} the main {{building}} by approximately 13 metres to the north-west and south-east are two wide butterfly-roofed, steel-framed shelters with built-in seating that faces both tracks. Four steel T-shaped components support steel perforated purlins, which inturn support the corrugated metal roof sheeting. The former divide the seating lengths. Set about {{four and a half}} metres apart, they are made with two cantilevered, tapering I-beams bolted to a rectangular hollow steel column (made with two C-sections welded together) which is founded in a concrete upstand. A perpendicular upstand runs the length of the shelter along the midline. Welded to the steel columns and beams are lighter steel frames. The infill panels of glass have been removed, as have some of the steel ones, while others are corroded. The seating is made with painted timber slats supported on timber studs and some steel framing. The downpipes taking water <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>box</b> gutter continue the rhythm of the columns, piercing the timber caps that join the two sides of seating at the centre of each gap.|$|E
