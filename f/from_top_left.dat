25|$|If {{this game}} is a {{coordination}} game, then the following inequalities hold in the payoff matrix for player 1 (rows): A>B,D>C, and for player 2 (columns): a>c,d>b. See Fig. 1. In this game the strategy profiles {Left,Up} and {Right,Down} are pure Nash equilibria, marked in gray. This setup can be extended {{for more than two}} strategies (strategies are usually sorted so that the Nash equilibria are in the diagonal <b>from</b> <b>top</b> <b>left</b> to bottom right), as well as for a game with more than two players.|$|E

2500|$|The Song Dynasty scholar Shao Yong (1011–1077) rearranged the hexagrams in {{a format}} that resembles modern binary numbers, {{although}} he did not intend his arrangement to be used mathematically.

2500|$|The image pixel data, scanned {{horizontally}} <b>from</b> <b>top</b> <b>left,</b> are converted by LZW encoding to {{codes that}} are then mapped into bytes for storing in the file. The pixel codes typically don't match the 8-bit {{size of the}} bytes, so the codes are packed into bytes by a [...] "little-Endian" [...] scheme: [...] the least significant bit of the first code is stored in the least significant bit of the first byte, higher order bits of the code into higher order bits of the byte, spilling over into the low order bits of the next byte as necessary. [...] Each subsequent code is stored starting at the least significant bit not already used.|$|E
2500|$|The {{coat of arms}} of Ponce {{consists}} of an escutcheon (shield) in the Spanish tradition. This shield has a field with a party per bend division. The division runs <b>from</b> <b>top</b> <b>left</b> to bottom right. The field is red and black, bordered with a fine golden line. In {{the center of the}} shield is the figure of an erect lion standing on a bridge. [...] The top of the bridge is a golden, the middle is red bricks, and the base foundation is gray rocks. Under the bridge there are gray wavy lines. Over the shield rests a five-tower golden stone wall with openings in the form of red windows. To the left of the shield is a coffee tree branch with its fruit, and {{to the right of the}} shield is a sugarcane stalk. The symbols of the shield are as follows: The field represents the flag of the municipality of Ponce, divided diagonally in the traditional city colors: red and black. The lion over the bridge alludes to the last name of the conqueror and first governor of Puerto Rico, Juan Ponce de Leon. The waves under the bridge allude to the Rio Portugues, on the banks of which the city was born. [...] The coronet in the form of a five-tower mural crown above the shield allude to the Spanish crown, through which the settlement obtained its city charter. The coffee tree branch and the sugarcane stalk represent the main agricultural basis of the economy of the young municipality.|$|E
