New Zealand Winegrowers (NZWG), a national trade body, stated that the industry sold 1 billion <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> in nearly 100 countries. New Zealand accounted for over 10% of wines sold in Britain for more than Â£5 ($10).|$|E
2500|$|The {{medicinal}} use of wine was frequently studied by the Greeks, including Hippocrates, who did extensive {{research on the}} topic. He used wine as a cure for fevers, to ease convalescence and as an antiseptic. He also studied the effect of wine on his patients' stool. Various types of wine were prescribed by Greek doctors for use as an analgesic, diuretic, tonic and digestive aid. The Greeks were also aware of some negative health effects, especially those arising from the consumption of wine beyond moderation. Athenaeus made frequent mention of wine's ability to induce hangover and suggested various remedies for it. The poet Eubulus noted that three bowls (kylikes) were the ideal amount of wine to consume. The quantity of three bowls to represent moderation is a recurring theme throughout Greek writing (today, the standard 750 ml bottle contains roughly three to six <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine,</b> depending on serving size). In his [...] c. 375 BC play Semele or Dionysus, Eubulus has Dionysus say: ...|$|E

5000|$|Vermeer {{was about}} 27 when he painted The <b>Glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wine,</b> and {{according}} to the critic Walter Liedtke, [...] "No analysis of artistic conventions can suggest the sheer beauty and extraordinary refinement of a painting like The <b>Glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wine,</b> which may be considered one of Vermeer's first fully mature works".|$|R

6000|$|... "No, I am much {{obliged to}} you, miss, I'm sure. I've {{everything}} that I can require {{to make me}} comfortable--at least I--not comfortable--I'm never that." [...] He drank off two more <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine,</b> one after another.|$|E
60|$|He quietly {{left the}} room, {{and the two}} <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> that he had poured out for their supper--one for her, one for him--remained on the table untasted. This was what their agape had come to. At tea, {{two or three hours}} earlier, they had, in the freakishness of affection, drunk from one cup.|$|E

60|$|During the twelve-hour effort friends {{brought to}} the orator three <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine,</b> four cups of coffee, and one glass of beer--a most stingy re-enforcement of his wasting tissues, but the hostile Chair would permit no {{addition}} to it. But, no matter, the Chair could not beat that man. He was a garrison holding a fort, and {{was not to be}} starved out.|$|E
6000|$|The play itself nearly {{came to an}} {{untimely}} conclusion. Captain Lightfoot screwed his failing {{courage to}} the sticking point by several <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine,</b> with the result that, being a very abstemious man, he became tipsy.

60|$|Supper ended, {{the party}} broke up into old and young, the two elder gentlemen sadly {{discussing}} politics over their tall <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine,</b> the matrons talking over the wedding and Lady Archfield's stay in London at the parlour fire, {{and the young}} folk in a window, waiting for the fiddler {{and a few more}} of the young people who were to join them in the dance.|$|E
60|$|Having {{concluded}} {{his observations}} upon the soup, Mr. Osborne {{made a few}} curt remarks respecting the fish, also of a savage and satirical tendency, and cursed Billingsgate with an emphasis quite worthy of the place.

60|$|Mr. Griggins's spirits were {{slightly}} depressed {{for a short}} period by this unlooked-for result of such a harmless pleasantry, but being promptly elevated by the attentions of the host and several <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine,</b> he soon recovered, and became even more vivacious than before, insomuch that the stout gentleman previously referred to, assured us that although he had known him since he was THAT high (something smaller than a nutmeg-grater), he had never beheld him in such excellent cue.|$|E

He had, indeed, {{made up his mind}} to a great resolve; and thus unfolded his final scheme for his own reformation:-- ...|$|E
60|$|Here, on {{the school}} side of the wall, there was a {{separate}} establishment of servants, and a separate kitchen. There was no sending backwards or forwards of food or of clothes,--unless it might be when some special delicacy was sent in if a boy were unwell. For these no extra charge was ever made, as had {{been done in the}} case of young Stantiloup. Then a strange doctor had come, and had ordered the wine and the carriage. There was no extra charge for the kindly <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> which used to be administered in quite sufficient plenty.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile {{terms were}} {{ratified}} and agreed upon between Mrs Chick and Richards, {{with the assistance}} of Miss Tox; and Richards being with much ceremony invested with the Dombey baby, {{as if it were an}} Order, resigned her own, with many tears and kisses, to Jemima. <b>Glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> were then produced, to sustain the drooping spirits of the family; and Miss Tox, busying herself in dispensing 'tastes' to the younger branches, bred them up to their father's business with such surprising expedition, that she made chokers of four of them in a quarter of a minute.|$|E
