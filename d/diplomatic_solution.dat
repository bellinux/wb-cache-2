5|$|The French {{government}} negotiator Jean Sainteny flew to Saigon {{to consult}} Leclerc, who was acting as high commissioner {{in the absence}} of d'Argenlieu. Leclerc approved Sainteny's proposal to negotiate with Ho because he preferred a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>solution</b> to a larger conflict, but he still dispatched a flotilla with shiploads of French soldiers to northern Vietnam ready to attack if the talks failed. At that time, Ho felt that negotiations with the French constituted his best option because the Soviet Union had not yet endorsed the Vietminh or the Vietnamese nationalist party (VNQDD), and the French Communist Party chose to support French rule in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|In 1795, he {{returned}} to the practice of law in New York. He tried to control the policies of President Adams (1797–1801). In 1798–99, Hamilton called for mobilization against France after the XYZ Affair and became commander of a new army, which he readied for war. However, the Quasi-War was never officially declared and did not involve army action, though it was hard-fought at sea. In the end, President Adams found a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>solution</b> that avoided a war with France. Hamilton's opposition to Adams' re-election helped cause his defeat in the 1800 election. Jefferson and Aaron Burr tied for the presidency in the electoral college in 1801, and Hamilton helped to defeat Burr, whom he found unprincipled, and to elect Jefferson despite philosophical differences.|$|E
5|$|In Congress, the {{influential}} senator and losing presidential candidate Rui Barbosa championed the rebels' cause. Barbosa used the navy official's rhetoric {{against them in}} arguing for a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>solution,</b> noting that if the new dreadnoughts were as unsinkable as they claimed, the remaining warships in government hands would certainly {{not be able to}} force a military victory. Furthermore, he argued, if such an attack had the support of Congress and failed, any resulting destruction of Rio de Janeiro would be held at fault. These arguments won Barbosa much support in the Senate, {{so much so that the}} body began working on an amnesty that would absolve the mutineers of all criminal charges once the ships were turned back over to the government. After hours of debate, the bill was passed unanimously that day and sent to the lower Chamber of Deputies on 25 November.|$|E

5|$|The war {{took place}} in two theaters: {{northern}} in Lithuania and southern in Ukraine. In both, the Polish forces retreated before the numerically superior Russian forces, though they offered significantly more resistance in the south, thanks to the effective leadership of Polish commanders Prince Józef Poniatowski and Tadeusz Kościuszko. During the three-month-long struggle several battles were fought, but no side scored a decisive victory. The largest success of the Polish forces was the defeat {{of one of the}} Russian formations at the Battle of Zieleńce on 18 June; {{in the aftermath of the}} battle the Polish highest military award, Virtuti Militari, was established. The war ended when the Polish King Stanisław August Poniatowski decided to seek a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>solution,</b> asked for a ceasefire with the Russians and joined the Targowica Confederation, as demanded by the Russian Empire.|$|E
5|$|In autumn 968, {{battles between}} the Holy Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire {{commenced}} in the Principality of Capua, in the Duchy of Benevento and Apulia, and hostilities continued until 970. Both {{sides of the}} conflict made many attempts to find a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>solution.</b> Otto I intended to receive recognition of his title in Byzantium, and to clarify the borders of Western and Eastern allegiances in southern Italy. He wanted this agreement to be ratified by the marriage of his son, Otto II, {{to a member of}} the Byzantine imperial family. Anna, daughter of the deceased Emperor Romanos II, was considered a possible bride. However, Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas was unwilling to marry off a purple-born princess (i.e. a child born to a reigning emperor). After tough negotiations with Nikephoros II Phokas' successor John I Tzimiskes, Archbishop of Cologne Gero secured the marriage of Otto II with Theophanu, a member of the Byzantine imperial family who was not, however, born to the purple.|$|E
5|$|In 1852, John Camden Neild, an {{eccentric}} miser, left Victoria an unexpected legacy, which Albert {{used to obtain}} the freehold of Balmoral. As usual, he embarked on an extensive programme of improvements. The same year, he was appointed to several of the offices left vacant {{by the death of}} the Duke of Wellington, including the mastership of Trinity House and the colonelcy of the Grenadier Guards. With Wellington's passing, Albert was able to propose and campaign for modernisation of the army, which was long overdue. Thinking that the military was unready for war, and that Christian rule was preferable to Islamic rule, Albert counselled a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>solution</b> to conflict between the Russian and Ottoman empires. Palmerston was more bellicose, and favoured a policy that would prevent further Russian expansion. Palmerston was manoeuvred out of the cabinet in December 1853, but {{at about the same time}} a Russian fleet attacked the Ottoman fleet at anchor at Sinop. The London press depicted the attack as a criminal massacre, and Palmerston's popularity surged as Albert's fell. Within two weeks, Palmerston was re-appointed as a minister. As public outrage at the Russian action continued, false rumours circulated that Albert had been arrested for treason and was being held prisoner in the Tower of London.|$|E
50|$|Numerous legacy issues {{remained}} in South America into the 20th century, {{some of which}} attracted military solution. Military technology was increasing throughout the period, {{with the introduction of}} mobile warfare and aircraft - but logistics and the sheer cost of modern warfare remained key challenges, leading to an increasing trend towards <b>diplomatic</b> <b>solutions</b> over the period.|$|R

25|$|The Belgian {{government}} was strongly {{opposed to the}} Iraq War during the Iraq crisis of 2003. The Verhofstadt government proposed a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>solution</b> regarding WMD and took the view that military action could only be taken with UN approval.|$|E
25|$|The affair {{became a}} {{diplomatic}} challenge as the foreign press took note and {{sided with the}} Italians. A <b>diplomatic</b> <b>solution</b> was found and the parties were compensated: the Italian workers on the one hand, and France for the riots at the Palazzo Farnese, the French Embassy in Rome. The mayor of Aigues-Mortes, Marius Terras, had to resign.|$|E
25|$|The Italian Government took a mixed approach. Defense Minister Giovanni Spadolini had the {{military}} send sixty paratroopers, four helicopters, and {{experts on the}} ship's layout to the British base at Akrotiri. Prime Minister Bettino Craxi looked for a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>solution</b> beginning a near-continuous dialogue with every country involved, including the nations with citizens aboard, and the Arab states of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and Tunisia.|$|E
50|$|U.S.-led {{operations}} in Iraq and Afghanistan have forced Al-Qaeda and Taliban loyalists to flee, seeking {{refuge in the}} nation of Zekistan by invitation of the nation's dictator, Mohammad Jabbour Al-Afad. His tyrannical regime houses death camps and training centers for the terrorist networks, and promotes cleansing of the ethnic Zeki population. After several failed <b>diplomatic</b> <b>solutions</b> and repeated warning by the UN, NATO votes to invade Zekistan to remove Al-Afad from power.|$|R
50|$|After {{the death}} of Stonewall Jackson {{prompted}} some sympathy for the south, Hotze attempted to organize pro-Confederacy meetings in Manchester, Sheffield, Preston and elsewhere to support a House of Commons resolution, initiated by J. A. Roebuck, for recognition of the Confederacy. Its failure and withdrawal on July 13, 1863, seemed {{like the end of}} hope for <b>diplomatic</b> <b>solutions</b> to Hotze. When James M. Mason was withdrawn, Hotze was the only remaining agent for the Confederacy in Britain.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1930s Britain and France coordinated their {{policies}} toward the aggressive dictatorships of Mussolini's Italy and Hitler's Germany. However public opinion {{did not support}} going to war again, so the diplomats sought <b>diplomatic</b> <b>solutions,</b> but none worked. Efforts to use the League of Nations to apply sanctions against Italy for its invasion of Ethiopia failed. France supported the [...] "Little Entente" [...] of Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia. It proved much too weak to deter Hitler.|$|R
25|$|On Ukraine between 8 and 12 October Polish cavalry under Gen. J. Rómmel reached Korosteń. After the mid-October Battle of the Szczara River, the Polish Army {{had reached}} the Tarnopol-Dubno-Minsk-Drisa line. The Bolsheviks sued for peace and the Poles, {{exhausted}} and constantly pressured by the Western governments, with Polish army now controlling majority of disputed territories, agreed to try <b>diplomatic</b> <b>solution</b> once again. A ceasefire was signed October 12 and went into effect October 18.|$|E
25|$|Despite Saudi Arabia {{asking for}} Pakistan's support {{to join the}} coalition, the Pakistan {{government}} has also called for a ceasefire {{in order to help}} negotiate a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>solution.</b> Alongside Turkey, Pakistan has taken initiatives to arrange a ceasefire in Yemen. Analysis written in U.S. News, Pakistan's strategic calculations firmly believes that if the Saudis enter into a ground war in Yemen– with or without Pakistani military– it will become a stalemate; therefore, Pakistan is increasing its efforts to potentially help engineer a face-saving solution to achieve a ceasefire and end the war.|$|E
25|$|On 3 April 1982, the United Nations Security Council {{comprising}} the five permanent {{members and the}} 10 elected members (Poland, Spain, Ireland, Panama, Guyana, Japan, Jordan, Uganda, Zaire, and Togo) passed the Resolution 502 demanding an immediate withdrawal of all Argentine forces from the islands and called on the governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom to seek a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>solution</b> to the situation and refrain from further military action. Panama voted against this resolution, with China, Poland, Spain and the Soviet Union abstaining. All 10 remaining members voted for the resolution.|$|E
50|$|Human intelligence, {{gathered}} by spies, is usually carefully tested against unrelated sources. It is notoriously prone to inaccuracy. In some cases, sources will just make up imaginative stories for pay, {{or they may}} try to settle grudges by identifying personal enemies as enemies of the state that is paying for the intelligence. However, human intelligence is often the only form of intelligence that provides information about an opponent's intentions and rationales, and it is therefore often uniquely valuable to successful negotiation of <b>diplomatic</b> <b>solutions.</b>|$|R

Borja Guijarro Usobiaga writes on potential <b>diplomatic</b> <b>solutions</b> to the crisis.

25|$|While the Emperor {{received}} detailed {{reports from}} Sugiyama and Nagano about the operations in Southeast Asia and the attack of Pearl Harbor, Prime Minister Konoe made one last {{desperate attempt to}} avoid war. That very evening, he arranged a secret dinner conference with American Ambassador Joseph Grew. He told Grew that {{he was prepared to}} travel to meet Roosevelt on a moment's notice. The ship had already been prepared. Ambassador Grew urged his superiors to advise Roosevelt to accept the summit proposal. However, in the end, Konoe's last push for a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>solution</b> was made in vain.|$|E
25|$|The Libyan Civil War {{began in}} 2011, {{the last year}} of Ban's first term, and {{dominated}} his attention and public statements that year. Throughout the conflict, he lobbied for peaceful solutions to the crisis. He frequently spoke out against military action in Libya, believing that a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>solution</b> would be possible and preferable. However, he conceded that if then-leader Muammar Gaddafi refused to abide by a cease fire agreement, the international coalition of military forces would {{have no choice but to}} intervene to protect the human rights of Libyans. The Gaddafi government was eventually overthrown and Gaddafi killed in the conflict.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} May, the Kriegsmarine {{had become}} even more opposed to invading Britain {{following}} its Pyrrhic victory in Norway: after Operation Weserübung, the Kriegsmarine had only one heavy cruiser, two light cruisers, and four destroyers available for operations. Raeder was strongly opposed to Sea Lion, for almost the entire Kriegsmarine surface fleet had been either sunk or badly damaged in Weserübung, and his service was hopelessly outnumbered by the ships of the Royal Navy. British parliamentarians still arguing for peace negotiations were defeated in the May 1940 War Cabinet Crisis, but throughout July the Germans continued with attempts to find a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>solution.</b>|$|E
5000|$|On June 3, 2006, Tony Blair {{was granted}} a private {{audience}} with Pope Benedict XVI at the Vatican {{at the end of}} a week-long trip to Italy.

A Vatican spokesman said: [...] "The Pope did stress that diplomacy and not conflict was the best way forward". The two leaders also discussed how [...] "moderate voices" [...] from the world's main religions need to work together to tackle extremism and reduce the risk of terrorism.|$|R
50|$|In case of {{allegation}} of use of chemical weapons or the prohibited production, a fact-finding inspection can be employed according to the convention. None of those activities have taken place, although the OPCW contributed to investigations of alleged use of Chemical Weapons in Syria {{as part of a}} United Nations mission. The OPCW only undertakes these inspections on request of another member state, after verification of the presented proof. To avoid misuse, a majority of three quarters can block a challenge inspection request. Furthermore, the OPCW can only be involved after bilateral <b>diplomatic</b> <b>solutions</b> have failed.|$|R
40|$|This work {{examines}} {{the development of}} U. S. military airlift from unproven curiosity to a transformative system of technologies, tactics and logistical support which enabled the United States to engage diplomatic and military scenarios around the world. Through an examination of contemporary reports, technological advances and statistical analyses of airlift practices it is shown that the period of 1938 - 1949 witnessed a great leap in tactical and technological innovation within the U. S. air transport community. The capabilities utilized during air supply missions to China during World War II and the Berlin Airlift foreshadowed a transformative capability providing military and <b>diplomatic</b> <b>solutions</b> when none previously existed.

25|$|Efforts by Costa Rican President Óscar Arias and the United States {{to effect}} a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>solution</b> between Micheletti and Zelaya {{initially}} resulted in a proposal by President Arias calling for Zelaya's return to the presidency, albeit with curtailed powers. Arias's proposal also stipulated political amnesty and advanced the Honduran general elections by a month, pushing them {{to take place in}} October. In spite of US support for the (dubbed) San José Accord, negotiations ultimately broke down as the two parties were unwilling to come to any lasting agreement. Zelaya also insisted that he would not recognise the elections of 29 November as a precondition to returning to power.|$|E
25|$|On February 15, 1898, the Maine {{exploded}} in the harbor of Havana, Cuba, killing hundreds of crew members. While Roosevelt and many other Americans blamed Spain for the explosion, McKinley sought a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>solution.</b> Without approval from Long or McKinley, Roosevelt sent out orders to several naval vessels, directing them to prepare for war. George Dewey, who had received an appointment to lead the Asiatic Squadron {{with the backing of}} Roosevelt, later credited his victory at the Battle of Manila Bay to Roosevelt's orders. After finally giving up hope of a peaceful solution, McKinley asked Congress to declare war upon Spain, beginning the Spanish–American War.|$|E
25|$|In a weak {{military}} {{position with}} few troops, Otto's regent in Italy attempted a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>solution</b> and opened peace negotiations with Berengar II. Conrad recognized that a military confrontation would impose great costs upon Germany, both in manpower and in treasure. At {{a time when}} the kingdom was facing invasions from the north by the Danes and from the east by the Slavs and Hungarians, all available resources were required north of the Alps. Conrad believed that a client state relationship with Italy would be in Germany's best interest. He offered a peace treaty in which Berengar II would remain King of Italy on the condition that he recognized Otto as his overlord. Berengar II agreed and the pair traveled north to meet with Otto to seal the agreement.|$|E

Its goal is to provide political and financial support to candidates for federal office from US citizens who believe a new direction in US policy will advance US interests in the Middle East and promote real peace and security for Israel. Founded by former President Bill Clinton advisor Jeremy Ben Ami and policy analyst Daniel Levy and supported by prominent Israeli politicians and high-ranking officers (see Letter of support from prominent Israeli leaders), J Street supports <b>diplomatic</b> <b>solutions</b> over military ones, including with Iran; multilateral over unilateral approaches to conflict resolution; and dialog over confrontation {{with a wide range}} of countries and actors.|$|R
