Their fifth European title put them joint third with Bayern Munich and Liverpool. <b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> Champions League era is considered, this is their fourth title, putting them joint first with Real Madrid, until Madrid extend their lead by winning a fifth title in the Champions League era in the 2016 final.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day, the Egyptian forces also changed the {{disposition}} of their forces, moving the 9th Battalion to the Ad Halom bridge, the 2nd to Isdud itself, and the 1st to Iraq Suwaydan and Faluja. Heavy machine gun and armored units were dispersed in between. Staff soldiers and those who manned Bren carriers took positions together with regular infantry soldiers. The Israeli side {{did not know of}} this development, but was aware that they had been detected in the previous night's preparations. The army was against attacking Isdud soon, but the order was given by the political echelon. The attack was expected to be a tactical failure; Avraham Ayalon writes that it could have succeeded <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> southern Egyptian force in Isdud itself was attacked, but attributes that lack of such a plan to the inexperience of the command and the heterogeneous nature of the Israeli force, which according to him could not have pulled off such an offensive.|$|E

25|$|People should undergo regular {{physical}} examination to detect edema {{and signs of}} central nervous side effects. Blood pressure checks will reveal development of hypertension. Periodic serum electrolyte (sodium, potassium, chloride) measurements, complete blood cell counts and assessment of liver enzymes {{as well as of}} creatinine (renal function) should be performed. This is particularly important if Indometacin is given together with an ACE inhibitor or with potassium-sparing diuretics, because these combinations can lead to hyperkalemia and/or serious kidney failure.

25|$|Errors in the dbSNP can hamper {{candidate}} gene association studies and haplotype-based investigations. Errors may also increase false conclusions in association studies: {{increasing the number}} of SNPs that are tested by testing false SNPs requires more hypothesis tests. However, these false SNPs cannot actually be associated with traits, so the alpha level is decreased more than is necessary for a rigorous test <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> true SNPs were tested and the false negative rate will increase.

25|$|Shorter code lengths can be {{used for}} {{palettes}} smaller than the 256 colors in the example. If the palette is only 64 colors (so color indexes are 6 bits wide), the symbols can range from 0 to 63, and the symbol width can be taken to be 6 bits, with codes starting at 7 bits. In fact, the symbol width need not match the palette size: as long as the values decoded are always less than the number of colors in the palette, the symbols can be any width from 2 to 8, and the palette size any power of 2 from 2 to 256. For example, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> first four colors (values 0 to 3) of the palette are used, the symbols can be taken to be 2 bits wide with codes starting at 3 bits.|$|E
25|$|Double {{depression}} {{occurs when}} a person experiences a major depressive episode {{on top of the}} already-existing condition of dysthymia. It is difficult to treat, as sufferers accept these major depressive symptoms as a natural part of their personality or as a part of their life that is outside of their control. The fact that people with dysthymia may accept these worsening symptoms as inevitable can delay treatment. When and if such people seek out treatment, the treatment may not be very effective <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> symptoms of the major depression are addressed, but not the dysthymic symptoms. Patients with double depression tend to report significantly higher levels of hopelessness than is normal. This can be a useful symptom for mental health services providers to focus on when working with patients to treat the condition. Additionally, cognitive therapies can be effective for working with people with double depression in order to help change negative thinking patterns and give individuals a new way of seeing themselves and their environment.|$|E
25|$|A {{second round}} of secret {{diplomacy}} by Anderson in February 1956 was equally unsuccessful. Nasser sometimes suggested during his talks with Anderson that {{he was interested in}} peace with Israel <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> Americans would supply him with unlimited quantities of military and economic aid. In case of Israeli acceptance to the return of the Palestinian refugees to Israel and to Egypt annexing the southern half of Israel, Egypt would not accept a peace settlement. The United States or the United Nations would have to present the Israeli acceptance to all Arabs as a basis for peace settlements. It is not clear if Nasser was sincerely interested in peace, or just merely saying what the Americans wanted to hear in the hope of obtaining American funding for the Aswan high dam and American weapons. The truth will likely never be known as Nasser was an intensely secretive man, who managed to hide his true opinions on most issues from both contemporaries and historians. However, the British historian P. J. Vatikitos noted that Nasser's determination to promote Egypt as the world's foremost anti-Zionist state as a way of reinforcing his claim to Arab leadership meant that peace was unlikely.|$|E

25|$|Partly as {{a result}} of these failures, and those of other English commanders at this period, John was one of the first {{important}} figures in England to conclude that the war with France was unwinnable because of France's greater resources of wealth and manpower. He began to advocate peace negotiations; indeed, as early as 1373, during his great raid through France, he made contact with , brother and political adviser of Pope Gregory XI, to let the pope know he would be interested in a diplomatic conference under papal auspices. This approach led indirectly to the Anglo-French Congress of Bruges in 1374–77, which resulted in the short-lived Truce of Bruges between the two sides. John was himself a delegate to the various conferences that eventually resulted in the Truce of Leulinghem in 1389. The fact that he became identified with the attempts to make peace added to his unpopularity at a period when the majority of Englishmen believed victory would be in their grasp <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> French could be defeated decisively as they had been in the 1350s. Another motive was John's conviction that it was only by making peace with France would it be possible to release sufficient manpower to enforce his claim to the throne of Castile.|$|E
25|$|The table below {{illustrates}} {{the capacity of}} a light rail train (the Siemens S70) {{compared to that of}} a standard car with five seats. The average length of a standard five-seat car is about 4.74 metres. The length of a Siemens S70 light rail vehicle is 27.7 meters, approximately the same length as 5.8 cars. The maximum occupancy of a five-seat automobile car is five people. The maximum capacity of the Siemens S70 is 220 people. This means that one metre in a car has a capacity of one person and one metre in a light rail vehicle has a capacity of almost eight persons, so the capacity of light rail is about eight times as high as that of an average consumer car, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> length of the vehicles is taken into consideration. The average width of an automobile is about 1.77 metres, while the average width of the Siemens S70 is about 2.7 metres. The area of an average consumer car is about 8.4m², while the area taken up by a light rail car is about 74.8m². In an automobile car, each square metre has room for only 0.6 persons, while each square metre in a light rail car has room for 2.9 persons. This means that a light rail vehicle is significantly more capacity-effective than a consumer car is. Height is not taken into consideration, because it is not normally a problem given minimum-clearance regulations for underpasses.|$|E
