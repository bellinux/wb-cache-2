50|$|In homolytic cleavage, or <b>homolysis,</b> the two {{electrons}} in a cleaved covalent bond are divided equally between the products. This process {{is also known}} as homolytic, or radical fission.|$|E
5000|$|Quantum {{mechanics}} simulations {{showed the}} N-hydroxylation catalyzed by flavin-containing monooxygenases initiated by <b>homolysis</b> of the O-O bond in the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate {{resulting in the}} formation of an internal hydrogen bonded hydroxyl radical.|$|E

5000|$|Bonds can {{be broken}} symmetrically or asymmetrically. The former is called <b>homolysis</b> and {{is the basis of}} the usual BDEs. Asymmetric {{scission}} of a bond is called heterolysis. For molecular hydrogen, the alternatives are: ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} step called {{initiation}} (2,3) a free radical is created by <b>homolysis.</b> <b>Homolysis</b> can be brought about by heat or ultraviolet light but also by radical initiators such as organic peroxides or azo compounds. UV Light is used to create two free radicals from one diatomic species. The final step is called termination (6,7) in which the radical recombines with another radical species. If the reaction is not terminated, but instead the radical group(s) go on to react further, the steps where new radicals are formed and then react is collectively known as propagation (4,5) because a new radical is created available for secondary reactions.|$|E
50|$|The {{peroxide}} bond undergoes <b>homolysis</b> {{at temperatures}} >100 °C. For this reason di-tert-butyl peroxide {{is commonly used}} as a radical initiator in organic synthesis and polymer chemistry. The decomposition reaction proceeds via the generation of methyl radicals.|$|E
50|$|Sulfonyl {{bromides}} {{have the}} general formula R-SO2-Br. In contrast to sulfonyl chlorides, sulfonyl bromides readily undergo light-induced <b>homolysis</b> affording sulfonyl radicals, which {{can add to}} olefins, {{as illustrated by the}} use of bromomethanesulfonyl bromide, BrCH2SO2Br in Ramberg-Bäcklund reaction syntheses.|$|E
50|$|The concerted, {{synchronous}} pathways presented above generally predominate; it {{was calculated}} for anionic oxy-Cope processes that a divide of 17-34 kcal/mol favors heterolysis over <b>homolysis.</b> Several factors may bridge this energetic gap, however, as evidenced {{in the work of}} Cha, Kim, and Cho.|$|E
50|$|The {{choice of}} a {{specific}} nitroxide species to use has a large effect on the efficacy of an attempted polymerization. An effective polymerization (fast rate of chain growth, consistent chain length) results from a nitroxide with a fast C-O <b>homolysis</b> and relatively few side reactions. A more polar solvent lends itself better to C-O <b>homolysis,</b> so polar solvents which cannot bind to a labile nitroxide are the most effective for NMP. It is generally agreed that the structural factor that has the greatest effect {{on the ability of}} a nitroxide to mediate a radical polymerization is steric bulk. Generally speaking, greater steric bulk on the nitroxide leads to greater strain on the alkoxyamine, leading to the most easily broken bond, the C-O single bond, cleaving homolytically.|$|E
50|$|Similar are the carbonyls such as {{molybdenum}} hexacarbonyl and tungsten hexacarbonyl and {{the related}} carbene and carbyne complexes. Compounds of the type CpM(CO)32 are known for all three metals, e.g. Cyclopentadienylmolybdenum tricarbonyl dimer. The chromium compound is however prone to <b>homolysis</b> of the Cr-Cr bond owing to steric crowding.|$|E
50|$|The symbol • {{indicates}} that the products are radicals; i.e., they contain at least one unpaired electron. Such species are highly reactive. The <b>homolysis</b> is usually induced by heating. The half-life of benzoyl peroxide is one hour at 92 °C. At 131 °C, the half-life is one minute.|$|E
50|$|Studies {{investigating}} {{the mechanism of}} cobalt-catalyzed peroxidation of alkenes by Nojima and coworkers, support the intermediacy of a metal hydride that reacts with the alkene directly to form a transient cobalt-alkyl bond. <b>Homolysis</b> generates a carbon centered radical that reacts directly with oxygen and is subsequently trapped by a cobalt(II) species to form the same cobalt-peroxide adduct as suggested by Mukaiyama. Metal exchange with the hydrosilane produces a silyl peroxide product and further reduction (via <b>homolysis</b> of the oxygen-oxygen bond) leads to the product alcohol. The authors also note, in accordance with previous studies, that the addition of t-butylhydroperoxide can increase the rate of slower-reacting substrates. This rate increase is likely due to oxidation of cobalt(II) to alkylperoxo-cobalt(III) complex, which subsequently participates in a rapid metal exchange with the hydrosilane to generate the active cobalt(III)-hydride.|$|E
50|$|Chlorination is {{generally}} highly exothermic. Both saturated and unsaturated compounds react directly with chlorine, the former usually requiring UV light to initiate <b>homolysis</b> of chlorine. Chlorination is conducted {{on a large}} scale industrially; major processes include routes to 1,2-dichloroethane (a precursor to PVC), as well as various chlorinated ethanes, as solvents.|$|E
50|$|The McLafferty {{rearrangement}} {{can occur}} in a molecule containing a keto-group and involves β-cleavage, with the gain of the γ-hydrogen atom. Ion-neutral complex formation involves bond <b>homolysis</b> or bond heterolysis, in which the fragments {{do not have enough}} kinetic energy to separate and, instead, reaction with one another like an ion-molecule reaction.|$|E
5000|$|The {{formation}} of radicals may involve {{the breaking of}} covalent bonds by <b>homolysis,</b> a process that requires significant amounts of energy. Such energies are known as homolytic bond dissociation energies, usually abbreviated as [...] "ΔH°". Splitting H2 into 2H•, for example, requires a ΔH° of +435 kJ·mol, while splitting Cl2 into 2Cl• requires a ΔH° of +243 kJ·mol.|$|E
50|$|The {{efficiency}} of polymerization increases {{more and more}} with increased steric bulk of the nitroxide up to a point. TEMPO ((2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl) is capable of inducing the polymerization of styrene and styrene derivatives fairly easily, but is not sufficiently labile to induce polymerization of butyl acrylate under most conditions. TEMPO derivatives with even bulkier groups at the positions α to N have a rate of <b>homolysis</b> great enough to induce NMP of butyl acrylate, and the bulkier the α groups, the faster polymerization occurs. This indicates that the steric bulk of the nitroxide fragment {{can be a good}} indicator of the strength of an alkoxyamine initiator, at least up to a point. The equilibrium of its <b>homolysis</b> and reformation favors the radical form to the extent that recombination to reform an alkoxyamine over the course of NMP occurs too slowly to maintain control of chain length.|$|E
50|$|Nitroethane is {{produced}} industrially by treating propane with nitric acid at 350-450 °C. This exothermic reaction produces four industrially significant nitroalkanes: nitromethane, nitroethane, 1-nitropropane, and 2-nitropropane. The reaction involves free radicals, such as CH3CH2CH2O., which arise via <b>homolysis</b> of the corresponding nitrite ester. These alkoxy radicals {{are susceptible to}} C—C fragmentation reactions, which explains {{the formation of a}} mixture of products.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{industrial}} application, about 100,000 tonnes of benzyl chloride are prepared annually by the gas-phase photochemical reaction of toluene with chlorine. The light is absorbed by chlorine molecule, the low energy of this transition being {{indicated by the}} yellowish color of the gas. The photon induces <b>homolysis</b> of the Cl-Cl bond, and the resulting chlorine radical converts toluene to the benzyl radical: ...|$|E
50|$|In the Gronert model these repulsive 1,3 {{interactions}} {{account for}} trends in bond dissociation energies which for example decrease going from methane to ethane to isopropane to neopentane. In this model the <b>homolysis</b> of a C-H bond releases strain {{energy in the}} alkane. In traditional bonding models the driving force {{is the ability of}} alkyl groups to donate electrons to the newly formed free radical carbon.|$|E
50|$|The triphenylmethyl radical (often shorted to trityl radical) is a {{persistent}} radical {{and the first}} radical ever described in organic chemistry. It can be prepared by <b>homolysis</b> of triphenylmethyl chloride 1 (scheme 1) by a metal like silver or zinc in benzene or diethyl ether. The radical 2 forms a chemical equilibrium with the quinoid type dimer 3(3-triphenylmethyl-6-diphenylmethylidene-1,4-cyclohexadiene). In benzene the concentration of the radical is 2%.|$|E
50|$|Nitromethane is {{produced}} industrially by treating propane with nitric acid at 350-450 °C (662-842 °F). This exothermic reaction produces the four industrially significant nitroalkanes: nitromethane, nitroethane, 1-nitropropane, and 2-nitropropane. The reaction involves free radicals, including the alkoxyl radicals {{of the type}} CH3CH2CH2O, which arise via <b>homolysis</b> of the corresponding nitrite ester. These alkoxy radicals are susceptible to C—C fragmentation reactions, which explains {{the formation of a}} mixture of products.|$|E
50|$|The Norrish type I {{reaction}} is the photochemical cleavage or <b>homolysis</b> of aldehydes and ketones into two free radical intermediates. The carbonyl group accepts a photon and is excited to a photochemical singlet state. Through intersystem crossing the triplet state can be obtained. On cleavage of the α-carbon bond from either state, two radical fragments are obtained. The size {{and nature of}} these fragments depends upon {{the stability of the}} generated radicals; for instance, the cleavage of 2-butanone largely yields ethyl radicals in favor of less stable methyl radicals.|$|E
50|$|The diradical {{mechanism}} {{has been}} supported by kinetic studies performed on the reaction, which have revealed that the reaction is not truly unimolecular, as it is most likely initiated by hydrogen addition from another gas-phase species. However, the reaction still obeys first-order kinetics, which is a classical characteristic of radical chain reactions. A mechanistic rational for the thermal rearrangement of azulene to naphthalene is included below. <b>Homolysis</b> of the weakest bond in azulene occurs, followed by a hydrogen shift and ring closure so as to retain the aromaticity of the molecule.|$|E
