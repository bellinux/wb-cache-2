40|$|Abstract — Short Message Service (SMS) is {{a hugely}} popular and easily adopted {{communications}} technology for mobile devices. Yet {{due to a}} lack of understanding in its insecure implementation, it is generally trusted by people. Users conduct business, disclose passwords and receive sensitive notification reports from systems using this communication technology. SMS was an “after-thought ” in the Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) design which uses SS 7 for signalling. SMSs by default are sent in cleartext form within the serving GSM’s SS 7 network, Over The Air (OTA), and potentially over the public Internet in a predictable format. This allows anyone accessing the signaling system to read, and or modify the SMS content on the fly. In this paper, we focus our attention on alleviating the SMS security vulnerability by securing messages using an approximate one-time pad. A one-time pad, considered to be the only perfectly secure cryptosystem, secures an SMS message for transport over any medium between a mobile device and the serving GSM network.

As the battery power is limited in portable devices, therefore it is required to manage the battery power in a way that it last longer. This research paper is focusing on the power management on the location estimation based history. The derived algorithm is divided into two parts; first: while the device is located in a single terrain only and secondly: when the device is falling at the intersection of two or more terrains. Location of the handheld device is used as a parameter for cluster calculation. At first the location estimation is done by triangulation method, an algorithm is derived which is getting information from Google earth about the terrain. Based on that knowledge by considering the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and the phenomenon of reflection, diffraction and scattering it is decided that how much power will be required by the portable device to communicate with the tower. Calculation of the location is based on the Available Signal Strength (ASS) and the Receive Signal Strength (RSS). In this research, we are considering <b>GSM</b> <b>architecture</b> and the cell phone is operating as a portable device. In the last part of the algorithm, while the device is not participating in the communication it is directed to change its state from the active mode to a park mode, so the device will save the battery power.

So, the corresponding three nodes (MS, VLR, and HLR) of these systems are involved as well in the authentication and data ciphering procedures. Moreover, the methods of the conventional cryptography have been adopted by all three systems.

40|$|M. Sc. (Information Technology) Making {{changes to}} a complex system, such as a {{cellular}} network, without being well informed about the potential effects of the change could prove to have negative and costly outcomes. In order to diminish the risk of making changes to a real system, a simulation of the real system is a viable and valuable alternative. By creating a simulation of the real system, the effects of changes made can be tested in the simulation instead of the real system. The dissertation presents a model by which subscriber behaviour within a cellular network can be simulated. The model that is introduced to this end is called the Mobile Network Subscriber-Behaviour Simulation (MNSS). Subscriber behaviour is important as it is {{largely responsible for the}} variation in traffic within the cellular network. Thus, the research presented in the dissertation seeks to provide a means by which the planning and operation of cellular networks can be enhanced through a better comprehension of network traffic, which is influenced by subscriber behaviour. In the dissertation, specific focus is given to voice traffic, and, as such, the cellular network architecture that was chosen for the model is the GSM mobile network architecture due to its ubiquitous use in carrying voice traffic. The research presented in the dissertation begins with a discussion on the <b>GSM</b> <b>architecture.</b> Subscriber behaviour is simulated through the use of intelligent agents that are configured to interact with one another to form a Multi-agent System. In addition, the subscriber agents interact with, and adapt to, the mobile network component of the MNSS model, which constitutes the formation of a Complex Adaptive System. Therefore, the discussion is subsequently directed towards Artificial Intelligence, intelligent agents, Multi-agent Systems and Complex Adaptive Systems. Using these aforementioned concepts, the dissertation presents the MNSS model and a prototype implementation, as well as a discussion on the results obtained from this. The main purpose of the dissertation is to examine a means by which subscriber behaviour can be simulated in a cellular network, through the use of multiple intelligent agents that interact in a complex system. This is conducted {{for the express purpose of}} analysing the change in behaviour of the subscriber agents in relation to changes made to external conditions, such as the underlying cellular network or the behaviour of other subscriber agents...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, avalanches, {{earthquakes}} and collapsed buildings are claiming an increasing death toll due to urbanisation, {{climate change and}} tourism, which means a harder work is required from Search and Rescue (SAR) operations. Despite this claim, SAR operations are still very limited and expensive, due to numerous constraints. RESCUECELL is a European Commission funded project, that {{will take advantage of}} the fact that nowadays most of the victims of this kind of accidents carry mobile phones with them, to develop an accurate location system based on mobile signal measurements, {{in order to create a}} cost-effective and portable kit for emergency search services, which will be easy to install and use. The aim of this thesis is to study, develop, and test the implementation of a portable GSM Base Transceiver Station (BTS) for the RESCUECELL system. This master node is called Control Centre (CC) and will be in charge of communicating with the buried GSM phones and locating them through captured mobile signals with the help of GSM sniffers, called Femtocell Access Points (FAPs) in this project, disposed within the disaster zone. <b>GSM</b> <b>architecture</b> involves a lot of highly expensive infrastructure, which would certainly not fulfill the requirements. The challenge of implementing it in a portable kit, easy to be transported by the rescue team, is faced in this thesis. Such implementation will be able to serve all the terminals within the disaster area, independently of the operator, and provide emergency and normal call support. Furthermore, cell selection and reselection procedures followed by Mobile Terminals (MTs) are studied, both for the technology chosen (GSM) as for other coexisting technologies (i. e. UMTS and LTE), in order to present an optimal cell setup that will enable the cell broadcasted by RESCUECELL CC to appear as the most attractive cell for the MTs in the affected area to attach to, in the presence of other competing cells, whether they are GSM, or other technology cells. Finally, CC-FAP communication is also studied and tested through GPRS communication, allowing the FAPs communicate the phones' signal properties (RSSI and ToA) to the CC and hence to locate them. In conclusion, this thesis presents the hardware and software used, procedures followed, requirements needed, optimal configuration, and developed code, in order to create a portable system that can make all phones in the affected area attach to the cell operated by RESCUECELL CC, and communicate with it, in order to permit the FAPs calculate their signal properties, and communicate them to the RESCUECELL CC leading to the phones' location...|$|E

With the rigorous growth of cellular network many mobility datasets are available publically, which attracted researchers to study human mobility fall under spatio-temporal phenomenon. Mobility profile building is main task in spatio-temporal trend analysis {{which can be}} extracted from the location information available in the dataset. The location information is usually gathered through the GPS, service provider assisted faux GPS and Cell Global Identity (CGI). Because of high power consumption and extra resource installation requirement in GPS related methods, Cell Global Identity is most inexpensive method and readily available solution for location information. CGI location information is four set head i. e. Mobile country code (MCC), Mobile network code (MNC), Location area code (LAC) and Cell ID, location information is retrieved in form of longitude and latitude coordinates through any of publically available Cell Id databases e. g.

40|$|The use of {{satellites}} for {{mobile communication}} applications {{has become a}} global issue. The use of handheld, vehicle mounted and transportable terminals is a key feature of Satellite Personal Communication Networks (S-PCNs). Due to the higher eirp requirements on the Earths surface and also because of their inherent delay, geostationary (GEO) satellites are not considered suitable for such applications. Instead, constellations of satellites at lower altitudes have been proposed for use in what are termed 2 nd generation mobile satellite communication systems. Low intensity regions in the Earths surrounding trapped radiation bands, have resulted in two altitude bands of specific interest, resulting in two constellation types - LEO (Low Earth Orbit) constellations at around 1, 000 km and MEO (Medium Earth Orbit) constellations at around 10, 000 km. A satellite constellation consists {{of a number of}} satellites orbiting at the same altitude and inclination and phased in a specific way. The work reported in this thesis proposes a network control architecture for LEO or MEO based S-PCN systems. Air-interface signalling aspects are then considered for mobility management and call setup signalling. LEO and MEO constellation design aspects and properties are initially considered. Important implications on the control network are drawn based on constellation coverage and connectivity properties. Other system constraints such as terrestrial network interworking considerations as well as user, network operator and regulator requirements are also considered. Finally network and more specifically satellite control signalling is examined before a S-PCN architecture is proposed. The reference architecture results in constellation control being distributed globally with individual satellite control, at any one time, being located at a specific earth station. The use of two earth station types allows network administration to be separated from traffic channel carrying aspects. In order to reduce system setup cost and delay, the reuse of network related standards from the GSM terrestrial mobile communication system is envisaged. An equivalence is made between the S-PCN <b>architecture</b> and the <b>GSMs</b> terrestrial <b>architecture.</b> Network implementation aspects are considered for a 14 satellite MEO constellation. Network implications resulting from the use of LEO and MEO constellations are considered. After an examination of S-PCN traffic demand on a MEO constellation, mobility management signalling is considered. A new approach is proposed based on the use of a positioning system. The performance of this approach is examined from a system signalling viewpoint for both LEO and MEO constellations and a method to minimise the required amount of signalling is described. The air interface signalling procedure for location update, based on a modified GSM network layer protocol, is simulated from a delay point of view for both LEO and MEO constellations. User-originated, user-terminated and user-to-user call setup signalling were also simulated and their delay performance examined. The importance of random access channel delay and of user cooperation with the link were highlighted as aspects which have a significant influence on the average signalling delay. Finally, the effect of common and dedicated control channel system signalling on satellite power consumption, based on busy hour call setup and mobility management signalling estimates, was examined for a MEO constellation. From this, conclusions can be made on the signalling power efficiency of S-PCN systems...|$|R

Finally, the work will conclude {{on the benefits of}} what has been presented and the future of upcoming technologies such as D VB-RCS will briefly looked into as to how they can improve Abis optimization and reduce the OPEX 1. 2 introduction This dissertation titled "GSM Backhauling over VSAT" derives its concept from two technology white papers. The first was published by Alcatel as an Alcatel Telecommunications Review - 15 t Quarter 2003. The paper titled as "New Opportunities for Satellites in Telecommunication Systems" discusses that how the new generation telecommunication networks may present the satellite industry with new tasks and markets. The second technology white paper comes from Comtech EF Data, Revision 2 published on December 21, 2005. The paper is titled as "GSM over VSAT: Choosing the Right Backhaul Solution". It discusses the Point-to-Point and Point-to-Multipoint GSM backhauling options. In the first former the SCPC access scheme is taken into consideration and in the latter two hybrid technologies based on two access schemes are well thought-out. Keeping into account the matters presented in the above mentioned papers, this project shall converse about certain aspects of the blending of such networks. Before proceeding on the integration of the two technologies, a detailed over view of the both <b>GSM</b> and VSAT <b>architectures</b> is carried out. The second chapter titled "The GSM Network" shall look at the <b>architecture</b> of a <b>GSM</b> network where it breaks down into its three component systems i. e. the Mobile Station (MS), the Base Station Sub-system (BSS) and the Network Switching Sub-system (NSS). The sub-components of each of the three shall be outlined in detail with their respective functions. The cell design objectives shall be looked at along with the call routing in a mobile network. This chapter shall out line the interfaces and protocols used in a GSM network and the OS! model will be discussed with special emphasis on the Physical Layer which in this case is the Transmission Layer (Tx Layer), concluding on a technical overview. The third chapter titled "The VSAT Network" will focus on the basic structure of the VSAT network its components, the modulation and access schemes related to this research i. e. SCPC (Single Channel Per Carrier), SCPC-DAMA (Single Channel Per Carrier - Demand Assigned Multiple Access) and DVB-RCS (Digital Video Broadcast through Return Channel Satellite). DVB-RCS will only be discussed as an emerging standard and the benefits that it will bring towards the concept of backhauling in GSM in Chapter 6. Later on we shall see how the overall channel capacity is calculated and what the parameters of the VSAT uplink are and downlink channel-to-noise ratio equations. The fourth chapter shall discuss the error correction and coding techniques used in digital communications and satellites and shall begin with the history of the infamous Shannon's capacity. Reasons shall be presented as to why coded information is preferred over un-coded information. Later on, in the chapter the comparison and contrast of hard and soft decision decoding shall be carried out and shall look at the different coding techniques used in satellite and digital communications, concluding on their prospects. Moving on towards the fifth chapter, which is the main research context, the integration of the two technologies at the Abis interface (in GSM) will be covered with discussion on the advantage of using a DAMA scheme arranged in a Mesh topology over plain SCPC arranged in a Star Topology, the results of the required frequency at the transponder of a satellite and finally the effects of rain attenuation as to how it plays a pivotal role in the degradation of the service. This is followed by a theoretical analysis of the research. In the sixth chapter the emerging DVB-RCS standard shall be discussed and some light shall be shed on the future research and prospects this technology has to offer the GSM industry as a backhauling option. Lastly a conclusion will be presented that shall once again outline the work done on this topic. School of Computing, Communications & Electronic...|$|R
