5000|$|In 1933, Newton Circus, a 40 ft wide {{circular}} carriageway, {{was constructed}} for <b>gyratory</b> <b>traffic</b> {{according to a}} Singapore Improvement Trust layout at {{the focus of a}} number of converging roads, including Bukit Timah Road, Dunearn Road, Newton Road, Keng Lee Road, Kampong Java Road, Bukit Timah Road, Clemenceau Avenue and Scotts Road.

50|$|Both of Stratford's {{shopping}} centres: The Stratford Centre and {{the recently}} opened (2011) Westfield Stratford City {{are located on}} either side of Stratford station. Westfield Stratford City, home to 350 stores, {{is one of the largest}} shopping centres in Europe. The older centrehas a range of accessibly-priced stores, its indoor and outdoor market stalls, and the 'inshops' network of small retail outlets. The centre occupies much of the 'island site' created in the 1960s by the surrounding <b>gyratory</b> <b>traffic</b> system.|$|E
5000|$|During {{that same}} year, Eno {{proposed}} {{the first version}} of today's roundabouts or traffic circles, which he termed [...] "the rotary or <b>gyratory</b> <b>traffic</b> system". In his 1920 book, Eno recalled that [...] "in 1903, the New York Police Department asked that a plan be suggested for Columbus Circle, where accidents were occurring almost daily. It was advised that vehicles should keep to the right, going around the circle in one direction instead of two. In 1905, the plan was put in operation.... In 1907, the system was put in operation at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, but whether due to the suggestion sent them from New York or not is not clear." [...] His 1909 book, Street Traffic Regulation, contains a diagram of the Columbus Circle rotary.|$|E
500|$|The road {{is part of}} the A4 {{connecting}} central London to Hammersmith, Earl's Court, Heathrow Airport and the M4 motorway. Congestion {{along the}} road has been reported since the mid-19th century, leading to its progressive widening [...] and removing the northern portions of Green Park. Traffic signals were installed in the 1930s. In the late 1950s, the Ministry of Transport remodelled Hyde Park Corner at the western end to form a major <b>traffic</b> <b>gyratory</b> system, including enlargement of Park Lane. It opened on 17 October 1962 at a cost of Â£5 million.|$|R
