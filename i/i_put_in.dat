25|$|In November 2002, {{the book}} “Victoria, Victoria!” came out, {{speaking}} further about her eating disorder. Victoria said: “I {{felt like an}} accelerating train, going right down... during the whole period. I had eating disorders and was aware of it, my anguish was enormous. I really hated how I looked like, how I was... I, Victoria, didn’t exist. It felt like everything {{in my life and}} around me was controlled by others. The one thing I could control was the food <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> me”. She further said that “What happened cost and I was the one who stood for the payments. Now I’m feeling well and with the insights I’ve acquired through this I can hopefully help someone else”.|$|E
25|$|The {{good news}} is, I'm finally {{working on my}} debut retail album. It sounds amazing so far. Everyone is excited about it. The bad news is, no more free music. Odds are, ever. No loopholes. Which means, Vampire Sunlight {{might be the last}} free release, and The Evil Microchip will not drop. Not even on YouTube. Sorry, Markus. But a major thank you is in order for {{everyone}} who's helped me this far. Everyone from Boe and Dre to Jimmy Iovine. All the graphic designers who have made covers, all the fans who uploaded my music, everyone. Thank you. My digital revolution has taken the Galaxy by storm, and I'm proud of it. It's just time to take things to a higher level. Hopefully, yall will support me. I'm not gonna throw the fact you've heard all my secrets for free in your face. But honestly, I would personally appreciate it if you went out and supported whatever <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> stores. More news to come, but once again, no free music indefinitely. Hold your head, kids...|$|E
500|$|Hanneman's lyrics for {{the song}} [...] "Angel of Death" [...] led to accusations of Slayer being Nazi sympathizers. Hanneman defended himself with [...] "nothing <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> the lyrics that says {{necessarily}} he (Josef Mengele) was a bad man, because to me – well, isn't that obvious? I shouldn't {{have to tell you}} that." [...] The band has stated numerous times that they are not Nazis and do not condone Nazism.|$|E

500|$|Duchess has {{prepared}} a ham and veal pie in a pink-rimmed dish (just like Ribby's dish), and {{would much rather}} eat her own pie. [...] "It is all ready to put into the oven," [...] she says, [...] "Such a lovely pie-crust; and <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> a little tin patty-pan {{to hold up the}} crust." [...] She reads the invitation again and realizes she {{will have the opportunity to}} switch the pies when Ribby leaves on an errand.|$|E
500|$|Hanneman was {{inspired}} to write [...] "Angel of Death" [...] after he read {{a number of books}} on Mengele during a Slayer tour. Hanneman has complained people usually misinterpret the lyrics, and clarified: [...] "Nothing <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> the lyrics that says necessarily he was a bad man, because to me— well, isn't that obvious? I shouldn't have to tell you that." [...] The band utilized the controversy to attract publicity, incorporating the Reichsadler into their logo (also the S in the band's name resembles the Sig runes used by the SS), and writing a song in Divine Intervention titled [...] "SS-3", which mentions Reinhard Heydrich, the second in command in the Schutzstaffel.|$|E
500|$|Writer Michael Michaelian {{originally}} {{pitched a}} story idea based on andropause, {{sometimes referred to}} as [...] "male menopause". He wrote a treatment and first draft script involving reverse aging. D. C. Fontana later explained that the terrorist MacGuffin (an ambiguous but central plot point) was not quite right. Fontana was brought in to overhaul the ending, and explained that a [...] "lot of what <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> at the end was also in Michael's story and drafts, but approached with a different emphasis". One significant alteration she made was to change the plot from involving actual terrorists to a trap that the crew must defuse. The original ending also had the two opposing parties on the planet sit down for peace talks with Jameson surviving the effects of the de-aging drugs. He would have been reduced in age to fourteen and could no longer remember his wife.|$|E

500|$|Harrison Ford {{stars as}} Indiana Jones, an {{archaeology}} professor who often embarks on perilous adventures to obtain rare artifacts. Jones {{claims that he}} has no belief in the supernatural, only to have his skepticism challenged when he discovers the Ark. Spielberg suggested casting Ford as Jones, but Lucas objected, stating {{that he did not want}} Ford to become his [...] "Bobby De Niro" [...] or [...] "that guy <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> all my movies"—a reference to Martin Scorsese, who often worked with Robert De Niro. Desiring a lesser known actor, Lucas persuaded Spielberg to help him search for a new talent. Among the actors who auditioned were Tim Matheson, Peter Coyote, John Shea, and Tom Selleck. Selleck was originally offered the role, but became unavailable for the part because of his commitment to the television series Magnum, P.I.. [...] In June 1980, three weeks away from filming, Spielberg persuaded Lucas to cast Ford after producers Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy were impressed by his performance as Han Solo in The Empire Strikes Back.|$|E
500|$|One such {{relationship}} was between Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, who wrote to Anne Wortley in 1709: [...] "Nobody was so entirely, so faithfully yours ... <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> your lovers, for I don't allow {{it possible for}} a man to be so sincere as I am." [...] Similarly, English poet Anna Seward had a devoted friendship to Honora Sneyd, who was the subject of many of Seward's sonnets and poems. When Sneyd married despite Seward's protest, Seward's poems became angry. However, Seward continued to write about Sneyd long after her death, extolling Sneyd's beauty and their affection and friendship. As a young woman, writer and philosopher Mary Wollstonecraft was attached to a woman named Fanny Blood. Writing to another woman by whom she had recently felt betrayed, Wollstonecraft declared, [...] "The roses will bloom when there's peace in the breast, and the prospect of living with my Fanny gladdens my heart:—You know not how I love her." [...] Wollstonecraft's first novel , in part, addressed her relationship with Fanny Blood.|$|E
2500|$|Andrews {{also wrote}} in his book Man of No Property that [...] "I have always {{believed}} that all individuals are, as human beings, equally important. My approach to them has been the same, high or low. Two only, among all the people I met, did <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> a class apart: they were Peadar Clancy and Gunnar Myrdal." ...|$|E

2500|$|Composer Terry Riley {{describes}} how {{he works with}} the Kronos Quartet, an ensemble devoted to contemporary music: [...] "When I write a score for them, it's an unedited score. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> just a minimal amount of dynamics and phrasing marks...we {{spend a lot of}} time trying out different ideas in order to shape the music, to form it. At the end of the process, it makes the performers actually own the music. [...] That to me is the best way for composers and musicians to interact." ...|$|E
2500|$|Off the field, {{he helped}} Red Sox pitcher Josh Beckett win a bet against catcher Doug Mirabelli. Breslow {{calculated}} {{how many times}} a baseball spins when it's thrown 90 miles an hour from the pitcher's mound to home plate. [...] "Josh {{wanted to know if}} I could figure out how many times a baseball spins {{on the way to the}} plate", Breslow said. [...] "There's a lot of variables, but <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> some figures and came up with answers for a fastball, curve, or slider. It's rather simple once you do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shlomo Ben-Ami, then Israel's Minister of Foreign Relations {{who participated}} in the talks, stated that the Palestinians wanted the {{immediate}} withdrawal of the Israelis from the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, and only subsequently the Palestinian authority would dismantle the Palestinian organizations. The Israeli response was [...] "we can't accept the demand for a return to the borders of June 1967 as a pre-condition for the negotiation." [...] In 2006, Shlomo Ben-Ami stated on Democracy Now! that [...] "Camp David was not the missed opportunity for the Palestinians, and if I were a Palestinian I would have rejected Camp David, as well. This is something <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> the book. But Taba is the problem. The Clinton parameters are the problem" [...] referring to his 2001 book Scars of War, Wounds of Peace: The Israeli-Arab Tragedy.|$|E

2500|$|After {{watching}} Michigan's 12–11 {{victory over}} Chicago in 1898, Louis Elbel, {{who was at}} the time a student in the University of Michigan School of Music, was inspired to write [...] "The Victors," [...] which was later adopted as Michigan's fight song. [...] He reportedly began composing the song at his sister's house in the Englewood section of Chicago and continued the effort on the return train ride from Chicago to Ann Arbor. [...] Elbel's lyric, [...] "Champions of the West," [...] refers to Michigan's having won the Western Conference championship {{for the first time in}} the school's history. [...] Elbel later recalled:"We were crazed with joy. [...] We paraded in the dark. We yelled and followed our U-M Band, singing to the tune of 'Hot Time in the Old Town.' It struck me quite suddenly that such an epic should be dignified by something more elevating, for this was not ordinary victory. [...] My spirits were so uplifted that I was clear off the earth, and that is when 'The Victors' was inspired. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> a lot of 'hails' and I knew the fellows would get them in with the proper emphasis. Through them, the title suggested itself, and I dedicated it to the Michigan team of 1898." ...|$|E
