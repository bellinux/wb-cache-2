The latter <b>is</b> <b>separated</b> by the Polden Hills from the main wetland of the Parrett/Tone/Cary valleys. The Poldens are a low narrow ridge of Blue Lias with {{alternating}} bands of limestone and clay. Because {{of the nature of the}} Levels and Moors, the Poldens have a significant visual impact.|$|E

5|$|Another {{potential}} source of lithium is the leachates of geothermal wells, which are carried to the surface. Recovery of lithium has been demonstrated in the field; the lithium <b>is</b> <b>separated</b> by simple filtration. The process and environmental costs are primarily those of the already-operating well; net environmental impacts may thus be positive.|$|E

In humans, replication protein A is the best-understood {{member of this}} family and is used in processes where the double helix <b>is</b> <b>separated,</b> including DNA replication, recombination, and DNA repair. These binding proteins seem to stabilize single-stranded DNA and protect it from forming stem-loops or being degraded by nucleases.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{amphibians}} {{and most}} reptiles {{have a double}} circulatory system, meaning a circulatory system divided into arterial and venous parts. However, the heart itself is not completely separated into two sides. Instead, it <b>is</b> <b>separated</b> into three chambers – two atria and one ventricle. Blood returning from both the systemic circulation and the lungs is returned, and blood is pumped simultaneously into the systemic circulation and the lungs. The double system allows blood to circulate to and from lungs which deliver oxygenated blood directly to the heart.|$|E
5|$|After it is dissolved, osmium <b>is</b> <b>separated</b> {{from the}} other {{platinum}} group metals by distillation or extraction with organic solvents of the volatile osmium tetroxide. The first method {{is similar to the}} procedure used by Tennant and Wollaston. Both methods are suitable for industrial scale production. In either case, the product is reduced using hydrogen, yielding the metal as a powder or sponge that can be treated using powder metallurgy techniques.|$|E
