40|$|The {{attached}} draft {{working paper}} on the statistical treatment of securities repurchase agreements, securities lending, <b>gold</b> <b>swaps</b> and <b>gold</b> loans is a Fund work-in-progress on the treatment of these complex and important transactions. The paper attempts {{to address the issue}} from a broad macroeconomic statistical perspective, as the transactions have an important role in monetary and financial statistical framework (as well as, to a lesser extent, in the national accounts and government finance statistics). The issue of the appropriate treatment of repurchase agreements (repos) and securities lending transactions has been discussed at three previous meetings of the IMF Committee on Balance of Payments Statistics (in 1995, 1996 and 1998). On each occasion, it was decided that the existing BPM 5 guidelines were inadequate to reflect the changing nature of these transactions and that additional methodological work in this complex area was required. Accordingly, in early 1999, a comprehensive research and consultation process was undertaken by the Fund. Visits were made to the authorities in several countries as well as to international organizations and {{a review of the literature}} was undertaken. The outcome of the research is reflected in the attached paper which shows that...|$|R

2500|$|From 2018, the Eagles' home {{guernsey}} {{will see}} a return of the club's former 'royal blue' design used prior to 2000, updated to feature the club's new logo. The club's away strip, which already uses a variation of this design with the royal blue and <b>gold</b> colours <b>swapped</b> around, will be updated to feature the new logo but will otherwise remain relatively unchanged. Between 2000 and 2015, the club's home jumper design featured a stylised eagle on a tricolour of navy blue, white and gold. This jumper was introduced during the 2000 season along with a much criticised ochre away jumper {{as part of a}} rebrand of the club to coincide with the new millennium. The ochre jumper was later dropped at the end of 2002 in favour of an updated version of the club's former royal blue jumper, which was worn during their 1992 and 1994 premierships. Starting in 2010, the Eagles also wore a third, predominantly white guernsey in order to avoid visual clashes with teams who used similar colours. It was dropped as the club's designated clash jumper at the end of 2016, in favour of an updated version of their original 1987 [...] "yellow peril" [...] guernsey. During October 2015, the club announced a navy version of the royal blue jumper would replace the tricolour guernsey as the club's home uniform from 2016, and was used until the introduction of the current design.|$|R

2500|$|Back at Mr. <b>Gold's</b> shop he <b>swaps</b> Hook's {{hand for}} the actual hook, but says that their deal is not done. Hook {{says that it is}} done because he saw Mr. Gold use the real dagger to open the box, which means he is still lying to Belle. Mr. Gold {{produces}} a video tape with a recording from the house they just left, threatening to reveal it to Emma. Hook states he only did it to rid himself of the cursed hand to be a better man, and that Emma will understand that. Mr. Gold then reveals that the hand is not cursed, but it allowed Hook to be [...] "the man he really is." [...] Mr. Gold states the hand allows him to be his true pirate self and embrace his darkness. Hook threatens that he'll have no problem [...] "crushing Belle's heart" [...] with the truth of Gold's deception and Mr. Gold states if that happens, he will [...] "lose" [...] Emma. For his threats, Gold states that Hook now serves him {{for as long as he}} lives, anticipating the [...] "fun" [...] they will have together. Emma visits the jail to talk to Will Scarlet and shows him the book he was found next to. He tries to say it has no meaning to him. Emma looks at his eye and asks what happened. Will sees Hook arrive and claims that he does not remember what happened to his eye. When Emma asks him about his hook being back, Hook states that Mr. Gold's magic wasn't what he had hoped it would be. David, going through documents with Elsa, tells Emma that the Snow Queen's alias, Sarah Fisher, is nowhere in any Storybrooke records stating that she did not arrive at the town via the curse. Hook, Emma, David and Elsa all look at each other wondering how the Snow Queen arrived at Storybrooke and Emma asks what she wants with her. Henry tells Regina that they need to talk to his other grandpa, Mr. Gold, about finding out who wrote the book to find the author. Regina says that Mr. Gold will not want to help her, so he goes to the shop and tells Mr. Gold that he wants to work at the shop. Henry states that because his father is dead Mr. Gold is the closest link to him, [...] Mr. Gold agrees to let Henry be his apprentice, but tells him not to touch anything. Then, Mr. Gold hands him the broom he and Hook used to find the Apprentice. After Mr. Gold leaves, Henry begins to sweep the floor.|$|R
