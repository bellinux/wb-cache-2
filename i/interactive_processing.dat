5|$|WFO Boise {{operates}} 24 hours a day, 365 days a {{year and}} provides weather forecasts, warnings, aviation forecast and local statements for Southeast Oregon and Southwest Idaho. There is one WSR-88D (NEXRAD) radar upgraded to dual polarization on August 30, 2012 improving the accuracy and identification of precipitation types and precipitation estimates. The office is also equipped with an Advanced Weather <b>Interactive</b> <b>Processing</b> System (AWIPS II) that greatly increases monitoring capabilities of weather, satellite, and computer model data by forecasters. The office also maintains eight Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS) around the area. NWS Boise employs 18 meteorologist of which two are dedicated Fire Weather Forecasters and Incident Meteorologists and one hydrologist. There are also 7 support staff member that provide technical, administrative and IT support.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln is {{equipped}} with a WSR-88D (NEXRAD) radar, one of 159 high-resolution Doppler weather radars operated by the National Weather Service. The Lincoln office is also equipped with an Advanced Weather <b>Interactive</b> <b>Processing</b> System (AWIPS) that greatly increases monitoring capabilities of weather, satellite, and computer model data by forecasters. In addition the Lincoln office is also in charge of Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS) at General Wayne A. Downing Peoria International Airport and Abraham Lincoln Capital Airport. NWS Lincoln employs both short and long term weather forecasters who each have vital duties. The short term forecaster issues the Hazardous Weather Outlook, river forecast products and monitors thunderstorm activity as it develops. The long term forecaster plans weather forecasts up until seven days into the future, coordinates with other long term forecasters in neighboring regions and issues advisories for Winter weather and dense fog. There are also meteorologists assigned to data acquisition responsibilities, staff in this position are responsible for monitoring weather balloons, river stage observations, operation of the NOAA weather radio system and operations of the cooperative observer network. During times of Severe Weather NWS Lincoln divides its covered area into various geographic districts with different forecasters handling the severe weather operation {{of his or her own}} sector. Depending on the severity of the outbreak NWS Lincoln employs 2 to 6 meteorologists to issue any warnings. Volunteer HAM radio operators are also present during most severe weather outbreaks, coordinating information between weather spotters and forecasters.|$|E
5|$|The National Weather Service Boise, Idaho is {{a weather}} {{forecast}} office responsible for weather forecasts, warnings and local statements {{as well as}} aviation weather forecasts and fire weather forecasts for 3 counties in Southeast Oregon and 14 counties in Southwest and South central Idaho. The U.S. Weather Bureau established {{an office in the}} Sonna Building on December 1, 1898. Since then, the U.S Weather Bureau office, now known as the National Weather Service forecast office gained forecast responsibility of Southern Idaho on June 22, 1970 which was expanded to the entire state of Idaho in 1973. After modernization in 1993, the forecast responsibility was changed to Southeast Oregon and Southwest Idaho. The current office in Boise maintains a WSR-88D (NEXRAD) radar system, 8 Automated airport weather station (ASOS) systems and Advanced Weather <b>Interactive</b> <b>Processing</b> System (AWIPS) that greatly improve forecasting in the region. Continuous weather observations have been maintained for the city of Boise since February 1, 1964 about 5 months after the U.S. Army established Fort Boise. The post surgeon for the U.S. Army took observations until July 1, 1877 when the U.S. Signal Service, established an office downtown. The Signal Office was discontinued on July 1, 1890.|$|E
40|$|<b>Interactive</b> {{image data}} <b>processing</b> has greatly {{improved}} {{the capability to}} extract scientific information from satellite image data. Previous methods of batch processing did not allow the scientist to interpret intermediate results on a short enough time scale to effectively modify either the data or processes as required for efficient data extraction. A primary Goddard Space Flight Center meteorological program objective is to develop methods to improve detection and prediction of severe storms using geostationary satellite measurements. <b>Interactive</b> data <b>processing</b> systems can perform many tasks towards meeting this objective. The development of <b>interactive</b> image <b>processing</b> techniques which have led to meteorological data processing systems at the Goddard Space Flight Center are discussed. Hardware and software functions of the existing Image Display and Manipulation System (IDAMS) and the special purpose METPAK software package which has been developed for performing meteorology operations on IDAMS are described. A second generation <b>interactive</b> image <b>processing</b> system, the Atmospheric and Oceanographic Information Processing System (AOIPS), which is under development, is also outlined.
