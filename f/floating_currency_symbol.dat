Moreover, the paper finds evidence that, not only yield differentials widen, but that US bond yields do react in anticipation of exchange rate movements, notably when these take place vis- 0 -vis major <b>floating</b> <b>currencies.</b> Last, the paper detects signs of nonlinearities in UIP at the mediumterm horizon for dollar rates vis- 0 -vis {{some of the major}} <b>floating</b> <b>currencies,</b> albeit surrounded by some uncertainty...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{behavior}} of interest rates and exchange rates following a variety of shocks to the international monetary system. Our analysis suggests that real interest rates in the US and Europe will remain low relative to historical experience {{for an extended period}} but converge slowly toward normal levels. During this adjustment interval, the US absorbs a disproportionate share of world savings. After a substantial initial appreciation of <b>floating</b> <b>currencies</b> relative to the dollar, the dollar and other <b>floating</b> <b>currencies</b> remain constant relative to each other. An improvement in the investment climate in Europe during the adjustment period would generate an immediate depreciation of the euro relative to the dollar. In real terms, the dollar and the <b>floating</b> <b>currencies</b> will eventually have to depreciate relative to the managed currencies. But most of the adjustment in the US trade account will come as US absorption responds to increases in real interest rates. ...|$|R
