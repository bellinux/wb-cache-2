30|$|The {{variation}} of common emission indices with <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> rate indicates that linear relationships are present for certain <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> fragments, where <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> fragments are the <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> rate regions {{for a given}} flight phase {{for all of the}} engines. For instance, the given <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> rates for the climb phases of all the engine models constitute a <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> region, while there are other specific <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> ranges for the other three flight phases: takeoff, approach, and landing. In other words, there is specific <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> region for each flight phase for the engines of each group. For these regions, the relationship between the emission indices and the <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> rates can be straightforwardly identified. However, for <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> rates outside the specified regions, particularly between the two regions, the approach based on the aforementioned relationship can lead to incorrect results. Therefore, one needs additional methods which can be obtained utilizing the sequential regions. For instance, if the overall <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> ranges are divided into three parts (highest, medium, and lowest regions indicating the amount of <b>fuel</b> <b>flow),</b> then the region between the highest and medium <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> rates and also between the medium and the lowest <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> rates can be described by additional relationships. The required model descriptions are presented in the following section.|$|R

30|$|It {{is noted}} that two common methodologies {{are used to}} {{estimate}} the <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> rate of commercial aircraft, namely, the Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) and Boeing <b>Fuel</b> <b>Flow</b> methods. In the BADA method, a total energy model is used {{for a wide range}} of aircraft types which involves all the forces acting on the aircraft and the variations of potential and kinetic energies. In the Boeing method, <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> data from the ICAO emission databank, which are calibrated to temperature and pressure ratios to obtain corrected <b>fuel</b> <b>flows</b> for the related cruise altitude and engine power, are used. However, since each method is based on <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> estimates considering relatively limited operating conditions, there exists the potential for high levels of error. This study, on the other hand, is believed to generate better estimates since it is based on actual flight data.|$|R

40|$|In lean {{premixed}} combustors of {{gas turbine}} engines, fuel-air mixing is considered vital for controlling pollutant emissions {{as well as}} combustion instability. Enhancement in mixing may be obtained by modulating the <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> rate. Modulation of <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> is also a useful technique to actively control combustion instabilities arising from the pressure oscillations in the combustor and thrust augmenters. Effectiveness of the forced oscillations depends {{on the level of}} dispersion present in the system.

This paper presents the experimental efforts undertaken to study the spatial and temporal dispersion of <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> rate oscillation introduced at the premixer inlet. Effects of oscillation amplitude and frequency are investigated at different bulk flow rates and at various locations in the premixer.
