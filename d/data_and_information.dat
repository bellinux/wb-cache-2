5|$|In July 2013, the Air Force began a fleet-wide {{technological}} upgrade of its B-52 bombers called Combat Network Communications Technology (CONECT) {{to modernize}} electronics, communications technology, computing, and avionics {{on the flight}} deck. CONECT upgrades include software and hardware such as new computer servers, modems, radios, data-links, receivers, and digital workstations for the crew. One update is the ARC-210 Warrior beyond-line-of-sight software programmable radio able to transmit voice, <b>data,</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> in-flight between B-52s and ground command and control centers, allowing the transmission and reception of data with updated intelligence, mapping, and targeting information; previous in-flight target changes required copying down coordinates. The ARC-210 allows machine-to-machine transfer of data, useful on long-endurance missions where targets may have moved {{before the arrival of}} the B-52. The aircraft will be able to receive information through Link-16. CONECT upgrades will cost $1.1 billion overall and take several years. Funding has been secured for 30 B-52s; the Air Force hopes for 10 CONECT upgrades per year, but the rate has yet to be decided.|$|E

25|$|The Gahnamak is {{believed}} to be written by Armenian Catholic Sahak Parthev (387-439), whose surname indicates distant Persian origin from the Parthav or Parthian clan. Sahak Parthev made the registrar available to the Sasanian Persian court, mentioning a total of 70 Armenian nakharars. In another source of the 4th century 86 nakharars were listed. According to the Arab chronologist Yacoubi (9th century) there were 113 lords in the administrative province of Arminiya, whereas another Arab historian, Yacout al-Hamavi (12–13th centuries) the number of Armenian principalities was 118. Armenian historians Agathangelos, Pavstos Buzand, Yeghishe, Lazar Parbetsi, Movses Khorenatsi, Sebeos and others also provided numerous <b>data</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> about Armenian princely houses and lords.

25|$|The DACS was {{established}} in the late 1970s. The software community, at that time, recognized the need for <b>data</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> about computer software, its development process and the software technology area in general. The rapid expanison of software engineering technology and the proliferation of tools and techniques made it difficult for an individual or organization to remain cognizant of the current status of the software engineering field. This situation resulted in the duplication of efforts in software research and seriously hampered the transfer of technology from the software research environment to the user sector of the software community.|$|E
25|$|In {{fulfillment}} of its charter, DACS engages {{in a continuous}} cycle of <b>data</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> collection, analysis, and dissemination. DACS adds value for the community by {{the manner in which}} it organizes and disseminates or otherwise packages information to make it accessible to the broadest spectrum of community members. Thus collection and dissemination are tightly integrated. DACS maintains an information rich web site, produces a quarterly technical journal, and periodically, develops State-Of-The-Art Reports (SOARs) on various software engineering topics in addition to focused research such as the ROI initiative and the Gold Practice initiative. The paragraphs below provide details about specific products and services.|$|E
25|$|The American Council on Science and Health {{said that}} denialism {{of the facts}} of climate science and of climate change, means to {{misrepresent}} verifiable <b>data</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> as political opinion. In that vein, anti-intellectualism puts scientists in the public view and so forces them to align with either a liberal or a conservative political stance. One third of Americans believe that climate scientists know about climate change, while fewer than one third believe that scientists know how to end global climate change. Moreover, 53 per cent of Republican politicians in the U.S. House of Representatives and 74 percent of Republican senators deny the scientific facts and the occurrence of climate change.|$|E

25|$|With wide deployment(s) of flash drives {{being used}} in various environments (secured or otherwise), the issue of <b>data</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> {{security}} remains important. The use of biometrics and encryption is becoming the norm {{with the need for}} increased security for data; on-the-fly encryption systems are particularly useful in this regard, as they can transparently encrypt large amounts of data. In some cases a secure USB drive may use a hardware-based encryption mechanism that uses a hardware module instead of software for strongly encrypting data. IEEE 1667 is an attempt to create a generic authentication platform for USB drives. It is supported in Windows 7 and Windows Vista (Service Pack 2 with a hotfix).|$|E

EPA's analysis determined that both ethanol produced from corn starch and biobutanol from corn starch comply with the 20% GHG emission reduction threshold required to classify as a renewable fuel. EISA grandfathered existing U.S. corn ethanol plants, and only requires the 20% reduction in life cycle GHG emissions for any renewable fuel produced at new facilities that commenced construction after December 19, 2007.|$|E
