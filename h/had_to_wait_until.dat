As a result, for a time the object became known to the wider public as Xena.|$|E

5|$|It {{was also}} {{realized}} that the beta decay of 239Np must produce an isotope of element 94 (now called plutonium), but the quantities involved in McMillan and Abelson's original experiment were too small to isolate and identify plutonium along with neptunium. The discovery of plutonium <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> the end of 1940, when Glenn T. Seaborg and his team identified the isotope plutonium-238.|$|E

5|$|After {{using the}} plot of the aborted 1884 {{collaboration}} with Archer to complete Widowers' Houses (it was staged twice in London, in December 1892), Shaw continued writing plays. At first he made slow progress; The Philanderer, written in 1893 but not published until 1898, <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> 1905 for a stage production. Similarly, Mrs Warren's Profession (1893) was written five years before publication and nine years before reaching the stage.|$|E
5|$|Chris Brandkamp {{produced}} most of {{the ambient}} and incidental sounds in the game. To make sure the sounds fit, Brandkamp <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> the game's visuals were placed in context. Sound effects were drawn from unlikely sources; the noise of a fire in a boiler was created by driving slowly over stones in a driveway, because recordings of actual fire did not sound like fire burning. The chimes of a large clock tower were simulated using a wrench, then transposed to a lower pitch.|$|E

Making only 20 starts in 26 appearances he scored just one goal for Tottenham leading him to be listed by one journalist as one of the worst signings of the January Transfer market.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{departure}} from Luton, Whalley joined Shrewsbury Town, recently promoted to League One, on 6 June 2015. Making only sporadic substitute {{appearances in the}} early part of the season, Whalley <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> 28 December to make his first league start for the club, scoring a late winning goal in a 2–1 away victory over Crewe Alexandra. He scored another late winner away at the league-leaders Burton Albion the following month, eventually ending the season with seven goals in all competitions as Shrewsbury avoided relegation with a game to spare.|$|E

From that point he became a regular member of the county side; he finished the season with 73 wickets {{at an average of}} 18.01, with best match figures of 11 for 41 against Worcestershire. From time to time he showed good form as a batsman, his best score being 70 against Northamptonshire.|$|E

5|$|By late May 1942, {{responsibility}} for the defence of Fiji shifted to the United States with a division arriving in the country. The 148th Infantry Regiment was {{to take over the}} positions of the 14th Brigade. While the 30th and 35th Battalions began packing and left the area by late June, the 37th <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> more American forces arrived. It was not until 5 August that the battalion boarded the American troopship President Coolidge and departed five days later. The battalion reached Auckland on 13 August and proceeded to Pukekohe where a camp had been established. After a few days, the battalion personnel went on leave for two weeks.|$|E

The trials were successful but revealed incomplete work that Cramp had to finish before {{he received his}} last payment. More work {{needed to be done}} on the armament, but it <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> she arrived in Russia. Retvizan was accepted on 23 March 1902, under the command of Captain Eduard Schensnovich who commanded her throughout her Russian service.|$|E
5|$|On 5 August, Pash {{received}} a secret message from Washington, D.C., {{reporting that the}} French physicist Frédéric Joliot-Curie had been sighted at his holiday home at L'Arcouest in Brittany. Joliot-Curie {{was at the top}} of Alsos's wanted list, so Pash and CIC Special Agent Gerry Beatson set out to investigate in the wake of the advancing U.S. Third Army. They searched the University of Rennes and found some documents there on 9 August. On 11 August they reached the homes of Joliot-Curie, Francis Perrin, and Pierre Auger in the L'Arcouest area. Joliot-Curie was not home, but German snipers fired on them, and they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> 12 August before they could search the house.|$|E

5|$|The {{invasion}} force left Bremerhaven {{early on}} 8 April 1940, bound for Kristiansand. When they arrived, a heavy fog obscured the city, making {{the passage of}} the fjord outside the harbor very dangerous. As a result, they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> the following morning to begin the attack. As Karlsruhe entered the fjord, she came under heavy fire from the Norwegian coastal guns at Odderøya Fortress. The cruiser turned in the fjord to bring her full broadside into action; the artillery duel lasted for about two hours before heavy fog again covered the port, forcing both sides to cease fire. The Norwegians surrendered an hour later, and the German ships landed their soldiers.|$|E

Their {{trenches}} stretched from the sea to Walkers Ridge and included two outposts, No.1 Post and No.2 Post. The regiment took over on the extreme right, with one squadron in the front line, one squadron in the support trench and the third squadron as the reserve. Next in line to their right, was the Auckland Mounted Rifles, and then the Wellington Mounted Rifles on the left. However, the regiment <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> it got dark before sending men forward to man the two outposts.|$|E
