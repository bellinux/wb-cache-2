25|$|Žalgiris {{became the}} {{dominant}} force in Soviet Union and in Europe when they added new talents to the team: first came Valdemaras Chomičius then Rimas Kurtinaitis and Vladas Garastas became the new team coach. But <b>everything</b> <b>changed</b> {{when the team}} noticed a talented young kid named Arvydas Sabonis, who was 17 years old 209cm and he debuted in the club in 1981. He grew about 12 more cm {{in the next couple}} of years and could do everything on the court: play defense, assist his teammates, shoot 3 pointers and dominate inside the paint.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of the German forces, the largest {{employer}} had been the States of Jersey and the States of Guernsey. Under the occupation, <b>everything</b> <b>changed,</b> and working-age people who remained still needed jobs to feed their families and themselves. Unemployment in Jersey at Christmas 1940 was 2,400 men. Many businesses closed or operated on reduced staffing levels, so many jobs vanished. The island governments tried to create suitable relief work. The island authorities introduced pay scales that were lower for single men or men whose wives and children were in England. They also cut the salaries of civil servants in half.|$|E
25|$|<b>Everything</b> <b>changed</b> in World War Two, when India {{became the}} main {{base for the}} American China Burma India Theater (CBI) {{in the war against}} Japan. Tens of {{thousands}} of American servicemen arrived, bringing all sorts of advanced technology, and money; they left in 1945. Serious tension erupted over American demands, led by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, that India be given independence, a proposition Prime Minister Winston Churchill vehemently rejected. For years Roosevelt had encouraged Britain's disengagement from India. The American position was based on principled opposition to colonialism, practical concern for the outcome of the war, and the expectation of a large American role in a post-colonial era. However, in 1942 when the Indian National Congress launched a Quit India movement, the British authorities immediately arrested tens of thousands of activists. Meanwhile, India became the main American staging base for aid to China. Churchill threatened to resign if Roosevelt pushed too hard, so Roosevelt backed down.|$|E

25|$|Ricky Ponting {{chose to}} bat {{when he won}} the toss for the visiting Australian cricket team in an {{extremely}} tense and see-sawing match at The County Ground, Bristol. It looked like a great decision when Jon Lewis and Darren Gough were smashed about early on, as Australia made their way to 57 for 0 after 11 overs with Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden taking sixes off Lewis over midwicket. However, with the entrance of Steve Harmison, <b>everything</b> <b>changed.</b> In his third over – the 12th of the game, he removed Gilchrist with a bouncy ball that the batsman edged behind, then Ponting with a yorker that he didn't play at – resulting in lbw – then a dot ball, and then Martyn with a slog shot to Pietersen at third man. Australia tried to consolidate, but when Hayden tried to hit out off Harmison four overs later, Paul Collingwood jumped up to pick the ball out of the air with his right hand – a magnificent catch, and Australia had lost four wickets for six runs, reminiscent of their collapse in the Twenty20 match earlier on in the week.|$|E
25|$|Then <b>everything</b> <b>changed</b> {{when the}} Jin dynasty attacked, with even better bombs. The iron bomb. Traditionally the {{inspiration}} {{for the development of the}} iron bomb is ascribed to the tale of a fox hunter named Iron Li. According to the story, around the year 1189 Iron Li developed a new method for hunting foxes which used a ceramic explosive to scare foxes into his nets. The explosive consisted of a ceramic bottle with a mouth, stuffed with gunpowder, and attached with a fuse. Explosive and net were placed at strategic points of places such as watering holes frequented by foxes, and when they got near enough, Iron Li would light the fuse, causing the ceramic bottle to explode and scaring the frightened foxes right into his nets. While a fanciful tale, it's not exactly certain why this would cause the development of the iron bomb, given the explosive was made using ceramics, and other materials such as bamboo or even leather would have done the same job, assuming they made a loud enough noise. Nonetheless, the iron bomb made its first appearance in 1221 at the siege of Qizhou (in modern Hubei province), and this time it would be the Jin who possessed the technological advantage. The Song command Zhao Yurong (趙與褣) survived and was able to relay his account for posterity.|$|E
25|$|It is said until Nasir left Malé Gayoom praised Nasir {{and talked}} {{in favour of}} him (As in his first speech after being sworn in as president). But after Nasir left Malé <b>everything</b> <b>changed.</b> After he left Malé, mass demonstrations were held against him, {{labeling}} him traitor, calling for his death. He was tried in absentia and sentenced. 16 May 1980 was the day Gayoom himself led a massive demonstration against Nasir and his 'crowd' in which Gayoom spoke to a crowd of between 15,000 and 20,000 (the population of Malé was then about 35,000) in which he discussed his views about how Nasir came to power, how he {{had been one of}} the leaders in the overthrow of first president Mohamed Ameen in 1953 and how he had allegedly mishandled government money. However, the allegations against Nasir were never proven. Later Gayoom pardoned him in July 1990, but never granted permission for him to return to Maldives. This point turned out to be proven according to an interview given by Kuvaa Mohamed Maniku, a close associate of Nasir to TVM on 23 November 2008. Maniku said he met President Nasir at Bangkok Airport in 1990 after Nasir had been pardoned by the Government and Nasir had told Maniku he had sent a letter to President Gayoom requesting permission to return to Maldives and to live anywhere in the country approved by President Gayoom. According to Maniku, late President Nasir had told him that he had not received a reply from Gayoom.|$|E

500|$|After {{the shock}} {{exit from the}} Confederations Cup with Spain, Villa {{returned}} from his holidays on 27 July amidst much media speculation linking him with top clubs such as Real Madrid, Barcelona, Liverpool, Chelsea, and Manchester United. Villa quelled such rumours after announcing his desire to remain at the Mestalla to fulfil his contract, underlining that he [...] "could not spend all summer refuting things, so I wanted to be quiet... I was told I should leave Valencia {{for the good of}} the club, soon after that <b>everything</b> <b>changed</b> and from that moment on I never saw myself out of here – before the Euros, the club told me what my asking price was, and I thought they were going to sell me, but when I returned from my vacations, Vicente Soriano said that he did not want me to leave Valencia. That removed all doubt for me. There is no train missed because all that I have achieved is because of Valencia and the Spanish national team." [...] When questioned on whether or not he should apologise to Valencia fans, he simply replied, [...] "I did not kill anyone, I do not think I have to ask for forgiveness." ...|$|E
500|$|Paul's sixteenth CD, The Day After <b>Everything</b> <b>Changed,</b> was {{released}} on January 12, 2010. Rather than work with a record label, Paul invited fans to help finance the recording by offering donors various premiums determined by the level of donation. [...] Although Paul wasn't sure {{what to expect when}} the United States economy collapsed, the fan-funding initiative resulted in more than $100,000 being collected - more, according to Paul, - than any label had ever spent on him. Recorded in Nashville with a guest appearance by Kristian Bush that includes a duet on the track, [...] "Paper Dolls", Paul says the fan support inspired him to make [...] "the best record I could". One reviewer wrote: [...] "This is such a tuneful, beautifully drawn set of songs played and sung with authority that it reminds you how much we need storytellers back in pop music—storytellers with empathy, fine eyes and an understanding that even though we live in a soulless, indifferent world our music doesn't have to reflect our culture." [...] In her review for the Folk and Acoustic Music Exchange, Roberta Schwartz said that the CD is [...] "a masterwork filled with the best music and lyrics of his career." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 1844 at a camp-meeting in Exeter, New Hampshire, <b>everything</b> <b>changed</b> when Samuel S. Snow {{presented}} {{a message of}} earth-shattering proportions—what {{became known as the}} [...] "seventh-month" [...] message or the [...] "true midnight cry." [...] In a complex discussion based on scriptural typology, Snow presented his conclusion (still based on the 2300 day prophecy in Daniel 8:14), that Christ would return on, [...] "the tenth day of the seventh month of the present year, 1844." ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>Everything</b> <b>changed</b> {{with the}} {{building}} of the Canadian Pacific Railway and its arrival in Banff in the late 1880s. [...] Bill Peyto may have been the first person to bring real tourists through the Sunshine area. The eccentric Peyto was a trapper and prospector. He was also a competent guide, as his rugged life gave him the skills required to face the often harsh realities of nature. In the 1890s Peyto would guide tourists through the Sunshine Meadows to the base of Mt. Assiniboine, the highest peak in the Southern Continental Ranges of the Canadian Rockies.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1929, <b>everything</b> <b>changed</b> {{when the}} German Reichsmarine {{laid down the}} keel of the first , an armored ship (in German, Panzerschiff).

2500|$|In March 1920, Sandford {{sent the}} message, [...] "Work." [...] No one {{anticipated}} that this directive would effectively end the Shiloh community within days.

2500|$|In August 1948, {{during a}} visit by an American writer, Chad Walsh, Lewis talked vaguely about {{completing}} a children's book he had begun [...] "in the tradition of E. Nesbit". After this conversation not much happened {{until the beginning of}} the next year. Then <b>everything</b> <b>changed.</b> In his essay [...] "It All Began With a Picture" [...] Lewis continues: [...] "At first I had very little idea how the story would go. But then suddenly Aslan came bounding into it. I think I had been having a good many dreams of lions about that time. Apart from that, I don't know where the Lion came from or why he came. But once he was there, he pulled the whole story together, and soon he pulled the six other Narnian stories in after him." ...|$|E
2500|$|William York of AllMusic wrote, [...] "the tracks {{here could}} best be {{described}} as miniature audio movies." [...] Christian Renner of Metal Crypt praised the album as being [...] "overall another excellent album worthy of extremely high praise and what would be a masterpiece for most bands turns out to be just another great album from the genius that is Opeth." [...] Jim Raggi of Lamentations of the Flame Princess said that [...] "this is still the most perfect album ever recorded." [...] He also stated [...] "the more personal nature of the lyrics on Morningrise are another thing that make it a much more intense listen than the stories that would follow. It's incredible how <b>everything</b> <b>changed</b> after this album. The lineup, the style, the lyrics... Opeth has never released less than an excellent album. But they have only released one perfect album." [...] Drew Schinzel of Chronicles of Chaos said that the songs are [...] "melodic and well played, with great vocals and the occasional guitar solo". However, he also commented, [...] "maybe I'm just not in touch with my inner-acoustic-child, but the acoustic sections are too numerous, and get old fast." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{area was}} lightly settled {{even before the}} {{founding}} of Moutier-Grandval Abbey around 640. [...] Much of {{the early history of}} the village is closely connected with the Abbey. [...] Between 1049 and 1150 the Abbey was granted a stift or land donation to support the college of canons. [...] The stift allowed the Abbey to grow into a major landholder and a regional power. [...] The village church of Saint-Pierre, which eventually became a parish church, was probably built during the Early Middle Ages. [...] In the 12th century another monastery was founded in Moutier, but it was destroyed in a fire in 1269. [...] In addition to the Church of Saint-Pierre, the collegiate church of Saint-Germain and Saint-Randoald was built in Moutier during the 12th century. [...] <b>Everything</b> <b>changed</b> in Moutier after the Protestant Reformation was accepted by Bern in 1531. [...] The Abbey closed and the college of canons relocated to Delémont. [...] The church of Saint-Germain and Saint-Randoald was closed while the church of Saint-Pierre converted to the new faith and was expanded. [...] A fire destroyed the church of Saint-Germain and Saint-Randoald in 1571 though in 1860-63 a Reformed church was built on the site. [...] The church of Saint-Pierre was demolished in 1873. [...] Today Moutier has both German and French speaking churches.|$|E
