40|$|Determining the gypsum {{content in}} soil is lengthy and {{cumbersome}} using methods based on SO 4 determination. Moreover, as these methods do not strictly titrate gypsum, inaccuracies {{can be produced}} {{by the presence of}} sulfate minerals other than gypsum. The thermogravimetric properties of gypsum, however, allow determination of its content in a rapid and easy way sufficiently accurate for many pedologic purposes. Our objective was to expand the lower limit of gypsum detection to make the test useful for soil classification and management.

The extraction kinetics were characterized by an initial solubility-controlled period (8. 78 g oil/kg CO 2 at 40 °C and 300 bar), followed by a transition period to a final mass transfer-controlled process. The integral yield of oil ap-proached an asymptotic value that was dependent on the parti-cle size of the substrate: 57. 1 g oil/kg dry oil-free substrate (large particles), 171. 0 g/kg (medium-size particles), or 391. 5 g/kg (small particles).

40|$|The {{potential}} for Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) {{was investigated in}} the sandstone outcrop succulent Talinum calycinum in central Kansas. Field studies revealed CAM-like diurnal acid fluctuations in these plants. These fluctuations persisted under all moisture and temperature regimes in the laboratory. Despite this CAM-like acid metabolism, simultaneous <b>gravimetric</b> <b>determinations</b> of day- and nighttime transpiration rates indicated {{the presence of a}} C 3 gas exchange pattern. Subsequent analyses of diurnal CO 2 and H 2 O exchange patterns under well-watered conditions and after 3, 5, and 7 days of drought confirmed these findings, though low rates of nocturnal CO 2 uptake were observed on the fifth night after continuous drought. Finally, the δ 13 C/ 12 C value of this succulent, − 27. 8 ‰, emphasizes the insignificance of any nocturnal CO 2 uptake in the lifelong accumulation of carbon in this species. Thus, it is proposed that T. calycinum is a C 3 plant with some CAM characteristics, including the ability to re-fix respiratory CO 2 at night under all moisture regimes, potentially resulting in a conservation of carbon, and occasionally to fix atmospheric CO 2 at night. These findings may prove to be common among rock outcrop succulents...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSuspended {{particulate}} {{inorganic matter}} (PIM) and {{particulate organic matter}} (POM) often exhibit significant variation both spatially and temporally in coastal oceans. The size distributions and optical properties of these particles are poorly known. Utilizing a newly developed inversion technique from the measured angular scattering pattern, {{we were able to}} examine POM and PIM in terms of detailed particle size distributions (PSD) and optical volume scattering functions (VSF), gaining further insights and knowledge of particles that will greatly improve biogeochemical investigations and remote-sensing algorithms. We report the results on two extremes or end-members of possible coastal environments, sediment-laden, turbid Mobile Bay, Alabama, USA and biologically productive, clear water Monterey Bay, California, USA. The optically inferred mass concentrations of PIM and POM, when accounting for the fractal nature of suspended particles, agreed well with the respective <b>gravimetric</b> <b>determinations</b> within the analysis and inversion uncertainty. Despite intra- and inter-site variability, the inferred PSDs in both coastal regions commonly showed an apparent background population of PIM at radii 50  μm. The clearly distinctive PSDs between PIM and POM provide evidence to support the Risović two-component model for suspended particulates. The shape of the VSFs, i. e., the scattering phase functions, for POM are similar between the two sites (backscattering ratio ≈  0. 0015), but the PIM in Monterey Bay exhibited a higher backscattering ratio than in Mobile Bay (backscattering ratios 0. 012 vs. 0. 008, respectively). At both sites, the mass-specific scattering cross section values for PIM (σ [PIM]) are about 70 – 80 % lower than σ[POM], while the mass-specific backscattering cross section values for PIM (σb[PIM]) are 10 – 25 % greater than σb[POM]...|$|R
40|$|Growth {{rates of}} {{unicellular}} microbes are usually determined by measurements of culture turbidity or by cell counts. However, growth of filamentous microbes cannot be assessed by counting and the heterogeneous distribution of mycelium generally precludes accurate turbidimetric measurements. Therefore <b>gravimetric</b> <b>determinations,</b> which are laborious and less accurate at low concentration, are required. This partly explains the comparative {{lack of information}} on the growth kinetics of such microbes. The growth kinetics of several fungi grown in submerged culture and on agar media have been studied by Trinci (1969, 197 ra, b, 1972), who compared specific growth rates, radial extension of colonies and germ-tube growth rates. Most actinomycetes form stable filaments and are generally regarded as slow-growing microbes, but there have been few attempts to determine their growth rates accurately. Haines (1932) recorded exponential germ-tube extension rates of several unidentified isolates, while Marshall & Alexander (1960) claimed that the rate of increase of mass of a Streptornyces sp. and a Nocardia sp. in submerged culture fitted a cube root relationship. Recently, Schuhmann & Berger (1976) studied the growth kinetics of Streptomyces hygroscopicus on solid medium. Since turbidity measurements can be used to estimate growth rates of fungi which have reasonably dispersed growth in submerged culture (Trinci, I 972; Caldwell & Trinci, 1973), we decided to evaluate the use of turbidimetric methods for determining the specific growth rates of streptomycetes.

40|$|For many {{developing}} countries such as Uganda, precise <b>gravimetric</b> geoid <b>determination</b> is hindered by the low {{quantity and quality of}} the terrestrial gravity data.   With only one gravity data point per 65 km 2, <b>gravimetric</b> geoid <b>determination</b> in Uganda appears an impossible task. However, recent advances in geoid modelling techniques coupled with the gravity-field anomalies from the Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) satellite mission have opened new avenues for geoid determination especially for areas with sparse terrestrial gravity. The present study therefore investigates the computation of a gravimetric geoid model over Uganda (UGG 2014) using the Least Squares Modification of Stokes formula with additive corrections. UGG 2014 was derived from sparse terrestrial gravity data from the International Gravimetric Bureau, the 3 arc second SRTM ver 4. 1 Digital Elevation Model from CGIAR-CSI and the GOCE-only global geopotential model GO_CONS_GCF_ 2 _TIM_R 5. To compensate for the missing gravity data in the target area, we used the surface gravity anomalies extracted from the World Gravity Map 2012. Using 10 Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) /levelling data points distributed over Uganda, the RMS fit of the gravimetric geoid model before and after a 4 -parameter fit is 11 cm and 7 cm respectively. These results show that UGG 2014 agrees considerably better with GNSS/levelling than any other recent regional/global gravimetric geoid model.   The results also emphasize the significant contribution of the GOCE satellite mission to the gravity field recovery, especially for areas with very limited terrestrial gravity data.
