5|$|Having taken heavy {{casualties}} and losing strategic superiority, Burbridge {{and his men}} conducted a disorganized withdrawal. The Confederates had succeeded <b>in</b> <b>holding</b> the rail breastworks, yet had expended most of their ammunition in doing so. Each Confederate infantryman had fired at least seventy-five rounds, with some firing significantly more. The Union commanders then ordered another charge with a cavalry regiment that reinforced the Union infantry. The unexpected fighting capabilities of the small Confederate force had temporarily created a reprieve for the salt works.|$|E
5|$|In Colombia, Gulf {{purchased}} the Barco oil concession in 1926. The government of Colombia revoked the concession the same year, but after much negotiation Gulf won {{it back in}} 1931.

5|$|Against Arkansas, Cody {{dominated}} Razorbacks center Jonathan Luigs—the 2007 Rimington Trophy winner—and {{helped the}} Crimson Tide to a 49–14 win. In a memorable {{play on a}} fourth-and-goal from the 1-yard line {{late in the first}} half, Cody blasted past Luigs and left guard Wade Grayson to grab running back Michael Smith before he could reach the end zone. In Alabama's rout over Georgia at Sanford Stadium, Cody was instrumental <b>in</b> <b>holding</b> Doak Walker award candidate Knowshon Moreno to just 34 yards rushing. In the seventh game of the season against Ole Miss, he received a knee injury during the third quarter which sidelined him for two weeks.|$|E

5|$|Aside from {{constant}} bombing sorties, Potez 25 and Breguet 19 aircraft {{were also}} used for daily supply missions to the besieged army garrison at Rogatica. They would land under fire at a small improvised grass landing strip, unloading ammunition and other supplies while keeping their engines running and taking off as soon as was possible. On 23 March, a ZNDH Potez 25 was shot down by the Partisans and the crew were killed. Three days later an Avia Fokker F.9 was damaged whilst dropping ammunition to Rogatica but managed to return to base safely. As {{a result of the}} determined re-supply effort by the ZNDH, the Rogatica garrison succeeded <b>in</b> <b>holding</b> out until relieved by German-NDH forces on 17 April.|$|E
5|$|Despite the battalion's success <b>in</b> <b>holding</b> the {{trenches}} at Lone Pine, the August Offensive failed {{to break the}} deadlock as setbacks elsewhere resulted in continued stalemate {{and for the rest}} of the campaign the fighting was relatively static. Finally, in December the decision was made to evacuate the Allied force from the peninsula. During the evacuation, two of the battalion's soldiers, William Scurry and Alfred 'Buntie' Lawrence played a significant part through their invention of a self-firing rifle, which assisted in making the Turks believe that there were still men manning {{the trenches}} even as they were being evacuated.|$|E
5|$|German {{forces in}} Stalingrad {{soon began to}} run out of supplies, some {{soldiers}} were forced to live on horse meat. By the end of 1942, the distance between the German 6th Army and forces outside of the encirclement was over , and most of the German formations in the area were extremely weak. Hitler's insistence <b>in</b> <b>holding</b> Stalingrad to the last risked the existence of the 6th Army. The end of the German offensive also allowed the Red Army to continue in its efforts to cut off German forces in the Caucasus, which would begin in the middle of January. On the other hand, the encirclement of the 6th Army and the operations to destroy it tied down a considerable number of Soviet troops, which affected Soviet operations on other sectors.|$|E

5|$|In 1915 the 8th Battalion {{joined the}} British Army in France {{as part of}} the 3rd Canadian Division. At the Second Battle of Ypres his troops faced the brunt of the German assault, {{involving}} the first use of poison gas in modern warfare. Lipsett is credited with issuing the first order to counteract the effects of poison gas, when he ordered his men to urinate on strips of cloth and tie them to their faces to neutralise the chlorine. Lipsett's battalion was instrumental <b>in</b> <b>holding</b> the line during the action and he was consequently rewarded by being made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, promoted to acting brigadier-general and given command of the Canadian 2nd Brigade, which he trained during the spring of 1916 to conduct major trench raids on German lines.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Gorrostieta Salazar {{was elected}} mayor of Tiquicheo. Several drug {{trafficking}} organizations, particularly the La Familia Michoacana and the Knights Templar Cartel, {{are based in}} the area. Michoacán is a leading producer of marijuana and opium poppy, making it a lucrative route for smugglers taking narcotics into the United States. Despite receiving threats, Gorrostieta Salazar publicly denounced the activities of these groups. The drug cartels, which are constantly fighting each other for territorial control, often target mayors who confront them. Other mayors, however, are corrupted and bribed by the cartels. Mexico has more than 2,500 municipalities, {{many of which are}} far from the capital cities and lack amenities available {{in other parts of the}} country. Many of these areas are plagued with drug-related violence, so the political parties have faced difficulties finding people interested <b>in</b> <b>holding</b> the post of mayor.|$|E
5|$|In early August, Major General Ironside {{launched}} his offensive against the 6th Red Army, with the British force subsequently inflicting {{large numbers of}} casualties and taking many prisoners for relatively little loss to themselves. The offensive was mainly fought through thick pine forest and swamp which provided little terrain for manoeuvre and although hugely successful, may have been unnecessary. Indeed, the Bolshevik forces in the region perhaps numbered only 6,000 men, and was probably engaged <b>in</b> <b>holding</b> operations only. It {{has been suggested that}} they probably had no intention of interrupting the Allied evacuation, and may have been caught unprepared by the sudden offensive. To be sure the main Red Army activity in early August was on the Siberian front, where Kolchak's White armies were falling back in disarray.|$|E

5|$|Lord Methuen {{failed to}} perform {{adequate}} reconnaissance {{in preparation for}} the impending battle, and was unaware that Boer Vecht-generaal (Combat General) De la Rey had entrenched his forces {{at the foot of the}} hills rather than the forward slopes as was the accepted practice. This allowed the Boers to survive the initial British artillery bombardment; when the British troops failed to deploy from a compact formation during their advance, the defenders were able to inflict heavy casualties. The Highland Brigade suffered the worst casualties, while on the Boer side, the Scandinavian Corps was destroyed. The Boers attained a tactical victory and succeeded <b>in</b> <b>holding</b> the British in their advance on Kimberley. The battle was the second of three battles during what became known as the Black Week of the Second Boer War.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in 1942 the Australian {{military}} {{was reinforced by}} units recalled from the Middle East and {{an expansion of the}} Militia and RAAF. United States military units also arrived in Australia in great numbers before being deployed to New Guinea, and in April 1942 command of Australian and US forces in the South West Pacific was consolidated under an American commander, General Douglas MacArthur. After halting the Japanese the Allies moved onto the offensive in late 1942, with the pace of advance accelerating in 1943. From 1944 the Australian {{military was}} mainly relegated to subsidiary roles <b>in</b> <b>holding</b> or mopping-up operations, but continued to conduct large-scale operations {{until the end of the}} war with a larger proportion of its forces deployed in the final months of the conflict than at any other time.|$|E
5|$|On July 29 the 1st Battalion {{suffered}} {{about 60}} casualties from North Korean mortar fire. As {{the men were}} preparing their perimeter defense for the night, a general panic arose, {{for reasons that are}} still unclear. Most of them deserted their positions in a state of alarm. Colonel White found himself, the 77th Combat Engineer Company, and a battery of the 159th Field Artillery Battalion all that was left in the front line. He had to personally reorganize the battalion as many of his officers were unable to get the men to listen to them. As White tried to rally his men, the field artillery maintained a sustained barrage of fire to slow the North Koreans advance. That night alone the artillery fired 3,000 rounds <b>in</b> <b>holding</b> back the North Koreans.|$|E
