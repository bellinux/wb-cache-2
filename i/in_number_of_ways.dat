This concept is common in whole Oceanian world.|$|E
50|$|This {{investigation}} {{is filled with}} many traps and thrills by Ajatshatru and his colleagues. They try to destroy the name of CBI <b>in</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>ways.</b> Things get worse when Ajatshatru comes to know about her wife Geeta helping CBI. He then beats Geeta brutally with his belt behind closed doors and leaves her hospitalised. Pratap, filled with anger, traps each of the criminals by hacking their respective phone's databases and capturing their illicit activities on CCTV cameras. When it is Ajatshatru's turn, Pratap cuts him with a sharp razor and beats him brutally and mercilessly in a salon behind closed doors. The duo also manage {{to get one of}} the criminals to believe {{that the rest of the}} gang are behind him thinking he is rat, and that he had better become a government witness for their case. The criminal who intimidated was the one who actually was only guilty, in this case, only of disposing of and burying the bodies. After the trial we see him hiding behind a pillar and still being threatened by the guilty miscreants on their way to prison. The heaviest sentence received was 10 years and the lightest was 3. Obviously justice is still blind because there was no sentence passed for the 300 villagers burned alive,the cruel beating of the wife, or the kidnap, abuse, and cutting of the tongue of Jhamunia.|$|E

40|$|For {{the last}} two decades, lot of {{research}} has been done on neural networks, resulting in many types of neural networks. These neural networks can be implemented <b>in</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>ways.</b> Due to the revival of research interest in neural networks, some important technological developments have been made in VLSI. This paper discusses comparative study between analog implementation and digital implementation for neural networks. The discussion topics include power-consumption, area, robustness, and implementation efficiency of these implementation techniques respectively. It can be estimated whether an analog or digital neural network is optimum for a specific application. It is observed that the choice between analog and digital neural networks is application dependent. The goal is to estimate which type of implementation should be used for which class of applications. This work is based on the study of neural implementations restricted only to pattern classification and focuses on widely used layered feed-forward neural network. Key words...|$|E

This paper presents a review of both kinds of ankle robots along with a brief analysis of their design, actuation and control approaches. While reviewing these designs it was observed that most of them are undesirably inspired by industrial robot designs. Taking note of the design concerns of current ankle robots, few improvements in the ankle robot designs have also been suggested. Conventional position control or force control approaches, being used in the existing ankle robots, have been reviewed. Apparently, opportunities of improvement also exist in the actuation as well as control of ankle robots. Subsequently, a discussion on most recent research in the development of novel actuators and advanced controllers based on appropriate physical and cognitive human-robot interaction has also been included in this review...|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of {{experts agree that}} taxes are distortionary in nature. This is relatively true {{for all of the}} different groups of taxes, but for the corporate taxes is exceptionally obvious. The existence of the corporate tax system can affect the company’s behavior <b>in</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>ways</b> {{and one of the most}} criticized is the ability for distortion of the choice of the sources of finance. In the following article, we explore the effects from corporate taxation on investment, through the methodological frame of the effective marginal tax rates. The objective is to analyze the investment decision in the case of isolated implementation of corporate taxes which means that the effects from the so-called “double taxation”, induced by the personal taxes are not taken in consideration. We hope to prove that these conditions generate “uneven” distribution of the burden across the projects covered with different sources of finance. Also, we intend to test and explore the properties of some alternative corporate tax systems which are widely known as neutral, such as: the comprehensive business income tax system (CBIT), the imputation corporate tax system (ICT), the full imputation corporate tax system (FICT), the allowance for corporate equity tax system (ACE) and the split rate corporate tax system (SRCT). In addition, we support our findings with a practical example: the case study from the implementation of the split rate corporate tax system in Macedoni...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Water is {{an eternal}} wonder, a life given force, a {{powerful}} agent of progress or ruin. Man must harness the basic resources wisely for the progress and prosperity of mankind. Water {{is the most}} precious commodity to the human life; if it is properly managed it can serve the society <b>in</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>ways.</b> Depending upon the circumstances it can be both priceless and worthless, blessing and a curse. Water is a common chemical substance that is essential to all known forms of life. We know that all life is dependent on water and that water exists in nature in many forms – clouds, rain, snow, ice and fog: however, strictly speaking chemically pure water does not exist for any appreciable length of time in nature. Even while falling as rain, water picks up small amounts of gases, ions, dust and particulate matter from the atmosphere. The prime {{aim of this study}} is to understand the water distribution pattern in Coimbatore city with considering the Siruvani Water Supply Scheme in a geographical manner. Questionnaire has been framed to collect the information about water supply and utilized as primary data and few relevant data collected from field investigations. In addition to the primary data, the suitable secondary data were collected from Government departments. Survey of India topographic sheets and Quick bird satellite imagery were used to prepare necessary thematic maps. The Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) were engaged to address the chosen research investigation in a cartographical way.

40|$|A quantum {{computer}} is a promising {{addition to a}} classical computer due to increase in performance on certain computational problems. A classical computer computes by manipulating bits, which assume a value either 0 or 1, using logical gates. Similarly, a quantum computation is carried out by manipulating quantum bits, so-called qubits, using quantum gates. The main advantage of qubits {{is that they can}} be not only in the states representing 0 and 1, but also in any superposition of these two states. Many different physical realizations for qubits have been proposed. One of the most promising candidates for the hardware of quantum computing are superconducting circuits. Here, the qubit can be represented <b>in</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>ways.</b> For example, the two different states can be the direction of current circulating in a superconducting loop, or presence and absence of a photon in a transmission line. In this thesis, we study a tunable phase gate for microwave photons. The gate is implemented by a transmission line interrupted by three superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), which we model as inductors. We theoretically show that this system fulfills the requirements of a phase gate and that the tunability of the phase shift is frequency dependent. In addition, we consider a non-ideal system by including the effects of the capacitance associated with the SQUIDs. We find that the capacitance has no adverse effects, and in the best case, it may even increase the range of tunability. We also measure the phase shift at frequency of 6. 3 GHz and find that the system is well described by the theory. To our knowledge, similar phase gate has not been experimentally studied before...|$|E

The {{purpose of the study}} is to uphold the evils that grey market that has invaded the Indian economy that is becoming a threat to the existence of few of the major sectors of India. This is a very extensive study regarding the effects Indian economy has due to the grey market invasion which is basically eating up the whole economy. Thus this needs to be controlled and mitigated. The grey market can be mitigated <b>in</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>ways.</b> But the intellectual property rights can prove to be a very powerful weapon if used in a proper way. Intellectual property right makes the original organization the legal owner of the product or service they produce. There are Indian laws that have protected the ownership rights of the organization. But the powers of intellectual property rights are yet to be cultivated. The premise of the study is to generate the awareness amongst the people regarding the potential of the weapon that the study has taken upon, against the grey market. Moreover, the study discusses about the usefulness of the competitive intelligence regarding the grey market mitigation with the help of intellectual property rights. In precise, grey market can be mitigated with the help of intellectual property rights. But the weapon needs a catalyst for its effectiveness and competitive intelligence is the catalyst which gives a competitive edge to the mitigating weapon.
