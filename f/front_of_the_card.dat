6000|$|Like a true philosopher, Flambeau had no aim in his holiday; but, {{like a true}} philosopher, he had an excuse. He {{had a sort of}} half purpose, {{which he}} took just so seriously that its success would crown the holiday, but just so lightly that its failure would not spoil it. Years ago, when he had been a king of thieves and the most famous figure in Paris, he had often {{received}} wild communications of approval, denunciation, or even love; but one had, somehow, stuck in his memory. It consisted simply of a visiting-card, in an envelope with an English postmark.

I want to meet you, for I have met all the other great men of my time. That trick of yours of getting one detective to arrest the other was the most splendid scene in French history."
