5|$|The game also {{provides}} a co-operative mode where two players may play through the game's campaign together via split-screen, system link, or through the Xbox Live online service. In co-operative, the missions are slightly altered to suit both players. For instance, some doors may require two players to open them. Additionally, in certain missions, the second player can occasionally start {{far away from the}} main player and takes over an allied character that was AI-controlled in the single player campaign. The respawn procedure is also altered substantially, as if one player dies, the other <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> and revive the partner's corpse to bring it back to life.|$|E

5|$|Chulip is an adventure/simulation game {{in which}} the player must improve the hero's {{reputation}} {{in the community of}} Long Life Town by kissing its various citizens. The player's health is represented by a number of hearts. To gain more hearts the player <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> and kiss other characters in the game. Finding out how and when to kiss other characters is a puzzle in of itself. The game and each of its non-player characters (NPCs) follow a 24-hour day schedule. In the daytime, many of the NPCs of the game are walking around the streets. To succeed in kissing an NPC, the player is required to wait for the correct time where they will be happy and press the corresponding button. The player must sometimes complete a certain task for that NPC. Choosing the wrong time to kiss will often result in the player getting hit and losing health. Exploring Long Life Town presents the player with numerous environmental hazards discovered by trial and error. For instance, attempting to use the town's playground equipment or being suddenly shot at by the night-patrolling policeman will cause instant death. One mission ends in the player being struck by lightning, removing more than ten hearts and resulting in a game over if the player does not have sufficient health.|$|E

25|$|The {{effects of}} such high incarceration rates are also shown in other ways. For example, {{a woman who has}} been {{recently}} released from prison is ineligible for welfare in most states. She is not eligible for subsidized housing, and for Section 8 she has to wait two years before she can apply. In addition to finding housing, she also <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> employment, but most likely she can not find a job because she has a criminal record so no one wants to hire her. Essentially, a woman who has been recently released from prison comes into a society that is not prepared structurally or emotionally to welcome her back.|$|E

25|$|Fermat's {{principle}} {{is the main}} principle of quantum electrodynamics which states that any particle (e.g. a photon or an electron) propagates over all available, unobstructed paths and that the interference, or superposition, of its wavefunction over all those paths {{at the point of}} observation gives the probability of detecting the particle at this point. Thus, because the extremal paths (shortest, longest, or stationary) cannot be completely canceled out, they contribute most to this interference. In humans, for example, Fermat's principle can be demonstrated in a situation when a lifeguard <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the fastest way to traverse both beach and water in order to reach a drowning swimmer. The principle has been tested in studies with ants, in which the ants' nest is on one end of a container and food is on the opposite end, but the ants choose to follow the path of least time, rather than the most direct path.|$|E

500|$|In {{many ways}} Norwegian society {{embodied}} the British radical ideal of [...] "a small-producer society, its wealth sufficiently dispersed to ensure rough equality", {{similar to what}} Wollstonecraft had outlined in A Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790). After careful consideration of how to improve {{the social and political}} problems in the places she visited, Wollstonecraft {{came to the conclusion that}} social progress must occur at a measured and [...] "natural" [...] rate. She argues that each country <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> its own way to improve, that democratic revolution cannot be foisted upon a people. She believed that the lower classes and the yeomen were the most promising [...] "potential source of revolutionary social transformation". Implicit in her assessment, however, was a bourgeois condescension; she viewed the lower classes as a group separate from herself, at one point describing their behavior as [...] "picturesque".|$|E
500|$|On a busy New York City street, Jones and {{his team}} use the energy cell to open a doorway into a {{parallel}} universe and bring a truck through, but are apparently unsuccessful, as Jones complains he used the [...] "wrong coordinates".

He’s been to The Wall and now he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the dragons." [...] Benioff and Weiss said that the conversation between Tyrion and Daenerys focused on the parallels between their lives, as Tyrion had a [...] "lot of empathy" [...] toward Daenerys for being an orphan, like himself, and both had [...] "terrible fathers". Tyrion realized that Varys might be right about Daenerys being the [...] "last hope for Westeros". Benioff and Weiss also suggested that Tyrion believes that Daenerys could bring him [...] "back into power".|$|E

But he's the hero. She believes he's the love of her life. I guess with that in mind you wouldn't let anything {{get in the way of}} that. Who knows, he might be." [...] However Breeds previously revealed she did not want the pair to romance each other, due to her real life relationship with Mitchell. Mitchell himself had also revealed he did not want the pair to start a romance. In comparison to her willingness to take him from Indigo, Breeds said Ruby would not have done the same whilst Romeo was with her best friend Annie Campbell (Charlotte Best).|$|E
