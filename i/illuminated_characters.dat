5000|$|Ella Leffland (born November 25, 1931) is an American {{novelist and}} short story writer. Highly {{regarded}} by other writers, her novels demonstrate stunning {{mastery of the}} techniques of realistic fiction; but Leffland uses her facility to <b>illuminate</b> <b>characters</b> whose imaginative lives are rich and often strange. The settings of most of her works are in northern California, where she grew up; she is {{perhaps best known for}} her semi-autobiographical novel Rumors of Peace (1979; reprinted as a [...] "rediscovered classic" [...] in 2011) about a girl coming of age during World War II. The fascination with personal and social evil that Leffland explores in Rumors of Peace emerges powerfully in her ambitious historical novel based on the life of Hermann Göring, Knight, Death and the Devil, published in 1990.|$|R

40|$|The first aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore Jane Austen 2 ̆ 7 s use of {{contrast}} in terms of characterisation. The second {{is to look at}} how contrast becomes a tool of didacticism, both for the characters within the novels and for readers of the novels. This study encompasses Austen 2 ̆ 7 s six completed novels and traces the development of the techniques she used to evoke contrast. Austen used contrast in a variety of ways. Primarily it was used to construct and <b>illuminate</b> <b>characters,</b> but Austen also used it to introduce characters into the narrative, to compare two or more characters, and to structure the arcs of characters throughout the plot. Many of Austen 2 ̆ 7 s plots are structured around the sustained contrast of two characters. This thesis traces Austen 2 ̆ 7 s maturation in her handling of this technique by looking at instances of direct and implied contrast. Austen also employed contrast as a tool of didacticism. Contrasting the actions and behaviours of various characters allowed Austen to portray some qualities as admirable and worth emulating, while others were shown to be negative and harmful. Realising these contrasts is a learning experience for both characters within the novels and for readers of the novels, if they choose. The chief qualities that Austen champions through her portrayal of her heroines are self-knowledge and personal integrity...|$|R

Dexter's second season has just gotten better and better and this week's episode was a true jaw-dropper, moving the plot along at an incredibly fast rate. ... This is truly an excellent and nailbiting scenario the writers have crafted, leaving the show in a wonderfully suspenseful situation. In fact, it was so thrilling, {{it felt like the}} penultimate episode of the season, and it's hard to believe there's still three more weeks left. Either way, the show has certainly proved it can continue to grab the audience and I'm sure I'm not alone by far when I say I can't wait to see what happens next." [...] The A.V. Club critic Scott Tobias gave the episode a B+ grade and stated that [...] "I'm having trouble figuring out what to write about the episode because so much of it involved the gears of the plot doing a lot of grinding, while leaving Dexter's characterization on the back burner.

Instead of advocating a unitary feminine view and making just one case against male-domination and discrimination in organizations, differences between groups of women and a multiplicity of forms of masculinity in working life are suggested. In order to better understand gender bias and conflicts in organizations, a differentiated understanding of gender/ organization relations is suggested, based on an organizational symbolism approach...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides a}} guide to John Philip Sousa's operetta El Capitan through investigating its historical significance, compositional distinctives, and performance practice. Chapter one introduces the nature {{and scope of the}} work by presenting a statement of the problem, the need and significance for the study, and its delimitations. The historical section of this document traces the genesis and process of the actual composition of the work, including identifying pieces borrowed from other Sousa works as well as consideration of Sousa's sketchbooks and other sources for compositional techniques. This section also presents a synopsis and performance history of the operetta, as well as biographies of the composer, lyricist, librettist, and major stage performers. The second part of the dissertation explores Sousa's compositional techniques and how harmonic, melodic and rhythmic considerations advance the plot of the operetta and <b>illuminate</b> <b>character</b> motivation. A comparison is made between the original and published scores for discrepancies. The performance guide includes interviews with key personnel involved in the 1973 Minnesota Opera production of El Capitan. This section closes with an appraisal of the strengths, weaknesses, and potential for successful revival of the work. The appendices provide information on El Capitan in print and recording, the original libretto, copies of programs from significant productions of the operetta, a partial listing of performances of the work between 1970 and 1994, and a description of the roles by voice type. The appendix also includes a transcription of the stage directions found in a stage manager's guide to El Capitan located in the Tams-Witmark collection at the University of Wisconsin.
