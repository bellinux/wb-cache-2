500|$|April 13: Brother Lyman [...] {{started on}} a mission to California with O. P Rockwell and others. [...] May the Lord bless and prosper them and return them in safety. <b>He</b> <b>left</b> <b>us</b> ... without {{anything}} to make bread, it not being in his power to get any.|$|E
500|$|Edwards {{was buried}} at Dudley Cemetery five days later, {{alongside}} his sister Carol Anne. More than 5,000 people lined {{the streets of}} Dudley for his funeral. His tombstone reads: [...] "A day of memory, Sad to recall, Without farewell, <b>He</b> <b>left</b> <b>us</b> all", and his grave is regularly visited by fans.|$|E
500|$|... {{continued}} to single me {{out at the}} dance, press my hand at parting, and utter expressions of unmeaning passion, to which I gave a meaning naturally suggested by the romantic turn of my thoughts.... When <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>us,</b> the colouring of my picture became more vivid—Whither did not my imagination lead me? In short, I fancied myself in love—in love with the disinterestedness, fortitude, generosity, dignity, and humanity, with which I had invested the hero I dubbed.|$|E
6000|$|He {{reflected}} for a space. [...] "It's a smash-up, Ann. More {{likely than}} not, Ann, <b>'e's</b> <b>left</b> <b>us</b> over'ead in debt. We {{got to get}} out of it just 'ow we can....|$|R

2500|$|Groucho {{himself was}} no help on this point; he was {{discussing}} the Brothers' names during his Carnegie Hall concert, {{and he said}} of his own, [...] "My name, of course, I never did understand." [...] He goes on to mention the possibility that he was named after his unemployed uncle Julius, who lived with his family. The family believed that he was a rich uncle hiding a fortune, and Groucho claimed that he may have been named after him by the family {{trying to get into the}} will. [...] "And he finally died, and <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>us</b> his will, and in that will he left three razor blades, an 8-ball, a celluloid dicky, and he owed my father $85 beside." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 1974, Benny {{cancelled}} {{a performance}} in Dallas {{after suffering a}} dizzy spell, coupled with numbness in his arms. Despite a battery of tests, Benny's ailment could not be determined. When he complained of stomach pains in early December, a first test showed nothing, but a subsequent one showed he had inoperable pancreatic cancer. Benny went into a coma at home on December 22, 1974. While in a coma, he was visited by close friends including George Burns, Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Johnny Carson and John Rowles. He died on December 26, 1974 at age 80. At the funeral George Burns, Benny's best friend for more than fifty years, attempted to deliver a eulogy but broke down shortly after he began {{and was unable to}} continue. Bob Hope also delivered a eulogy in which he stated, [...] "For a man who was the undisputed master of comedy timing, you would have to say this is the only time when Jack Benny's timing was all wrong. <b>He</b> <b>left</b> <b>us</b> much too soon." [...] He was interred in a crypt at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California. As a tribute to his skinflint stage persona, visitors often leave pennies on his crypt. [...] Benny's will arranged for a single long-stemmed red rose, to be delivered to his widow, Mary Livingstone, every day {{for the rest of her}} life. Livingstone died nine years later on June 30, 1983.|$|E
2500|$|Régis Debray called de Gaulle [...] "super-lucide" [...] {{and pointed}} out that {{virtually}} all of his predictions, such as the fall of communism, the reunification of Germany and the resurrection of 'old' Russia, came true after his death. Debray compared him with Napoleon ('the great political myth of the 19th century'), calling de Gaulle his 20th century equivalent. [...] "The sublime, it seems, appears in France only once a century ... Napoleon left two generations dead on battlefield. De Gaulle was more sparing with other people's blood; even so, <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>us,</b> as it were, stranded, alive but dazed... A delusion, perhaps, but one that turns the world upside down: causes events and movements; divides people into supporters and adversaries; leaves traces {{in the form of}} civil and penal codes and railways, factories and institutions (the Fifth Republic has already lasted three times as long as the Empire). A statesman who gets something going, who has followers, escapes the reality of the reports and statistics and become part of imagination. Napoleon and de Gaulle modified the state of things because they modified souls". However, Debray pointed out that {{there is a difference between}} Napoleon and de Gaulle: [...] "How can the exterminator be compared with the liberator? ... The former ran the whole enterprise into the ground, while the latter managed to save it. So that to measure the rebel against the despot, the challenger against the leader, is just glaringly idiotic. You simply do not put an adventurer who worked for himself or his family on the same level as a commander-in-chief serving his country. ... Regrettably, Gaullism and Bonapartism have a number of features in common, but Napoleon and de Gaulle do not have the same moral value. ... the first wanted a Holy French Empire without the faith, a Europe under French occupation. The second wanted to rescue the nation from the emperors and establish a free France in a free Europe".|$|E

60|$|Salamander sighed, {{but made}} no further objection, and {{half an hour}} later <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>us.</b>|$|E
60|$|It {{was there}} his voice belied the jest in his words, and <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>us</b> with precipitation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Fenn {{was here}} a few minutes ago," [...] he replied, [...] "but <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>us</b> abruptly. I fancy that he rather disapproved of our conversation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Father {{has gone}} to Scotland," [...] she said. [...] "He seems to be tired, and has had a good deal to worry him. <b>He</b> only <b>left</b> <b>us</b> yesterday." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Grant {{seemed to}} expect him. He {{is going to}} buy American mining {{machinery}} or something of the kind in Victoria. I believe it was <b>he</b> Grant <b>left</b> <b>us</b> to meet." ...|$|R
5000|$|Karagounis {{retired from}} {{international}} football after Greece's World Cup elimination in a penalty shootout loss to Costa Rica. <b>He</b> <b>left</b> as the nation's most capped player with 139 appearances over 15 years since making his debut in 1999. Greece's goalscorer in the Costa Rica match, defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos, {{paid tribute to}} his departing leader: [...] "He's written his own story ... he's the record holder caps, he's given everything for the team and had to make concessions for it... <b>He's</b> <b>left</b> <b>us</b> a legacy for the future. He shouldn't worry." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{the teacher}} {{concluded}} this anecdote we reached his door. Saying {{that he had}} business to attend to, <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>us</b> to amuse ourselves as we best could.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shouldn't have forgiven myself," [...] March said, [...] "if we hadn't let Tom {{know that}} twenty minutes after <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>us</b> {{we were still}} alive and well." ...|$|E
60|$|Isa. Came not Sir Timorous this way, gentlemen? <b>He</b> <b>left</b> <b>us</b> in the garden, {{and said}} he would look out my Lord Nonsuch, to make his peace with him.|$|E
6000|$|Lettie took my arm, {{and with}} her {{disengaged}} hand held her skirts above the wet grass. When <b>he</b> had <b>left</b> <b>us</b> {{at the end of}} the riding in the wood, Lettie said: ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Beyond a question; and no {{more than}} a commendable {{prudence}} required. Still <b>he</b> has <b>left</b> <b>us</b> in a most critical position. This priming is a little damp, and I distrust it. The coal, if you please." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that is good! As if the quarrel was {{not just}} as much mine, and every man's in the ship. Why, when he left Drake, <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>us</b> all, did he not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hunting, I think," [...] replied Edward; [...] "at least <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>us</b> {{this morning}} to join the Laird of Colmslie and his hounds. I have heard them baying in the glen all day." ...|$|E
60|$|With {{scarcely}} {{another word}} <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>us,</b> {{and a moment}} later we heard the roar of applause which greeted his appearance on the stage. Isobel's eyes kindled, and she moved restlessly towards the door.|$|E
50|$|Composing {{music for}} {{numerous}} films and documentaries prevented Arteaga from leaving {{a more extensive}} body of works for posterity. However, <b>he</b> has <b>left</b> <b>us</b> enough to justifiably situate his figure with the most outstanding of the 1951 generation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite right!" [...] said Sir Percival. [...] "Of {{course the}} {{housekeeper}} {{is the first}} person to question. Excessively stupid of me not to see it myself." [...] With those words <b>he</b> instantly <b>left</b> <b>us</b> to return to the house.|$|R
60|$|I {{could have}} {{answered}} this also, if our discussion {{had not been}} interrupted at the moment. The Doctor came into the library {{in search of a}} book. When <b>he</b> had <b>left</b> <b>us,</b> my colleague's strong prejudice against him instantly declared itself.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is Davy!" [...] he cried. [...] "Oh, the sly rascal! And {{this is the}} {{promenade}} of which <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>us</b> word, the solitary meditation! Speak up, man; you are forgiven for deserting us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hired him}} at Fort Pitt. <b>He</b> <b>left</b> <b>us</b> {{suddenly}} this morning. A big man, with black beard and bushy eyebrows. A bit of his ear {{had been shot}} or cut out," [...] Sheppard replied.|$|E
6000|$|Yes, I say gone! [...] <b>He</b> <b>left</b> <b>us</b> at Smorgoni hours ago. [...] The Sacred Squadron even he {{has left}} behind. [...] By this time he's at Warsaw or beyond, [...] Full pace for Paris.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, <b>he</b> <b>left</b> the <b>U.S.</b> Air Force {{and joined}} the Dallas Cowboys as a 26-year-old rookie, playing on special teams and quickly {{becoming}} a key reserve, {{on one of the}} best defensive line rotations in the NFL.|$|R
60|$|Kauffman {{remained}} {{for a few}} more minutes at our table, but he did not return to the subject. After <b>he</b> had <b>left</b> <b>us</b> with a somewhat stiff bow, he went and talked earnestly with Karl, the little head-waiter. Then he slowly returned.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{stand out}} against him," [...] he replied harshly, pausing with the towel in his hands. His eyes were hard and piercing. [...] "But if he expects me to gush over his coming back, he's fooled, that's all. <b>He's</b> <b>left</b> <b>us</b> to paddle our own canoe all this while, and, {{so far as}} I'm concerned, he can leave us alone hereafter. He looked out for his {{precious}} hide mighty well, and now he comes back here to play big gun and pat us on the head. I don't propose to let him come that over me." ...|$|R
