40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the efficacy of}} internal and external enforcement policy to combat illegal immigration. The model features search-theoretic unemployment and policy interdependency among multiple destination countries. With one destination country, internal and external enforcement policy have similar effects. With multiple destination countries, we consider prototypal geographical configurations. In one, all destinations are contiguous with the source country, while in the other only one destination country is contiguous with the source country. In both cases the equilibrium external enforcement policy level {{is lower than the}} joint optimum, calling for supranational authorities to implement immigration policy. In the absence of such policy, we consider the effect of delegating border control policy to one destination country and find that <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>authorities</b> to the largest country can improve each destination country ’s welfare relative to the Nash equilibrium level...|$|E

These changes are due to its harmonization with the EU criteria, and it is an important moment in the rise of healthy, independent generations, who will be able to face all the challenges that lie ahead in the global society of the future. With the signing of the Ohrid Framework Agreement the process of decentralization in Macedonia begins and the <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>authorities</b> will lead to a change in the control of the educational process. The educational system in Macedonia depends on the legislation itself and its structure, but also on those taking part in the educational process. In this paper we explain the notion of control and answer the question who performs control over the educational system in Macedonia, and how decentralization affects the distribution of control and responsibility in the educational process.

The long-term and diverse dysfunctions that affect these organizations more often than private enterprises cause a considerable wastage of organizational resources of companies wholly owned by the State Treasury. The result of development of organizational pathologies involves difficulties in the functioning and growth of companies wholly owned by the State Treasury, as well as the decrease of competitiveness when compared to private enterprises. This paper identifies such organizational pathologies developed in companies wholly owned by the State Treasury as negative empowerment, resistance to the change syndrome, identification with object of possession or management resulting in the lack of <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>authorities,</b> organizational attention deficit syndrome, responsibility decline syndrome, theft of company’s property, hackwork combined with mental incapacitation of employees and making a series of irrational decisions by the executives, often {{to the detriment of the}} company...|$|E
40|$|<b>Delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>authorities</b> is {{a common}} {{practice}} in various organizations. The way delegation is performed can be quite complicated. To capture possible delegation structures, the concept of delegation network is proposed, so that anyone can be convinced of who obtained delegation from whom {{in order to produce}} the final proxy signature. In this paper, we consider the delegation network for identity-based (ID-based) scenario. Since the public key is just a string denoting the user's identity, certificate management is simplified. Proxy signature schemes have been devised to delegate signing authorities. We show that a trivial attempt of extending an existing ID-based proxy signature may result in an insecure scheme. After that we propose a building block of our ID-based delegation network, which is an ID-based proxy signature supporting batch verifications. Our proposed ID-based delegation network is flexible {{in the sense that the}} whole delegation network does not need to be known in advance. Our proposal is provably secure under the random oracle model. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{changing}} {{demands of}} the environment is leading {{to the development of}} new organisational forms. These organisations are characterised by flexibility, specialisation, <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>authorities</b> and development of competence. Small organisations that have started to adapt innovative constructions in order to be flexible are becoming of increasing importance in trade and industry but are given little attention in current research. Purpose: To make an in-depth study of Agora in order to increase the understanding about small organisations where the majority of the work force consists of self-employed actors. Realisation: We have made a case study on one company, namely Agora. Our empirical findings where collected through six in-depth interviews. Results: We {{have come to the conclusion}} that Agora cannot be seen as neither a network organisation nor an imaginary organisation but something in between: an imaginary network. Furthermore, we have identified three main forces that hold the company together: the shared values, the business concept of Agora and the leadership. There is a distinct and strong leadership that to a large extent is linked to the personality of the CEO and it is crucial for the maintenance of Agora...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} the {{new management}} {{practice in the}} hotel industry. Over recent years, the environment for hotel management in Croatia has changed radically. Difficult business conditions require the transformation of management in the hotel industry. From the old-style business model, in which hotel managers were focused inwards on the hotel and its operation, a new paradigm encompassing a more externally oriented focus is now required. The current transformation of socially-owned hotels into capital-based and market-oriented business enterprises will accelerate the general process of privatisation and promote incentive management strategies. The article gives the research results of the new management practice {{in the case of}} the hotel "Excelsior" in Dubrovnik. It is one of the most successful hotels on the Croatian coast, which practises modern management. The research referred to management level, sex, age and educational structure of managers, their continuing education, knowledge, skills and characteristics of management, main functions of management, <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>authorities</b> and responsibilities, management system, decision-making, styles of leading and governing of managers by their time. The received results have been compared with the earlier management approach of the above-mentioned hotel.

40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, {{there is a great}} {{degradation}} in the environment of Sudan as a result of deforestation. The inclusion of the institutional forests in forest policy of 1986 was made in order to enhance and encourage all the institutions to adopt the activity. Two institutions managed to establish institutional forests, namely; El-Rahad Irrigated Scheme and Kenana Sugar Corporation (KSC). Even for these institutions there is a relative paucity analyzing company-community partnership. Moreover, there is no lettle information that explores the relationship between the Forests National Corporation (FNC) and the institutions, strategies and methods of application. Kennana Sugar Corporation institutional forests were selected for this study. The broad objective {{of this study is to}} explore the nature of the institutional forest with special emphasis on the strategies and evolution of institutional forests in Sudan, to investigate the degree of success of institutional forest and the possibility of transferring this model to other institutions and assess the main constraints confronting the activity. Two types of data were used to collect the necessary information, namely; primary and secondary data. The primary data was collected through interviewing, and self-administered questionnaire with the local people and the administrators, respectively. The main findings of the study were; the adoption of institutional forests was made without specification of the strategies and the objectives of the institutional forests. KS C institutional forest, in the absence of extension unit in the administrative level of the institutional forest, is run by foresters without enough background in forestry extension. Accordingly the administrators rely on top-bottom approach for the assignment of different tasks to appointed committees "Not elected" and <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>authorities.</b> Neither public meetings nor home visits are made toencourage the participation of local people. Moreover, KSC restrict the introduction of the tree component in the agricultural land. The formation of local institutions and performance of the species is made by the KSC. The main conclusions of the study area; the absence of scientific extension unit is behind the constraints confronting the community forestry activity; formation of local institution to administer the community forestry is the utmost need of the local people. The main recommendation is; KSC should establish a separate extension unit in the administration level of the institutional forests to run the extension program...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives: The {{destructive}} {{effect of}} centralized management {{can be found}} throughout each organization, which is a barrier for <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> and productivity leading to administrative violence increase and compression and frigidity of affairs. With attention to the importance <b>of</b> <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> this research aimed at determining {{the correlation between the}} manager's <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> with the manner of employee direction in Qom hospitals, designed for contributing to improvement of managers’ performance in hospitals. Methods: This correlational and cross-sectional research, was carried out on all the employees under the control of managers and chiefs of Qom province hospitals (N= 2167). Sampling was done by cluster sampling method through the use of Cokran sampling based on Morgan and kerjsi chart. 998 samples with the confidence level of % 95 and permitted errors of 0. 05 were randomly selected. Data were collected via questionnaires which were answered by self-report method. The data were then analyzed by the Pearson correlation coefficient, variance's test F analyses, multiple variant regression and T-test. Results: The mean score of the manager's non-delegation <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> was (32. 4). Among the indicators of the direction, there was a significant relationship between the motivation (mean= 61. 44) and organizational communication (49. 39), also there was a significant relationship between the managers’ <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> and the manner of their employees direction (non-delegation <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> R=- 0. 13). Conclusion: Due to the meaningful and direct relationship between most of direction variables with the managers’ <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority,</b> increasing the <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> and deconcentration can lead to an increase in employee motivation and (vertical and formal) communication and improved performance of affairs...|$|R

[...] Monday 2 ̆ 7 s {{scheduled}} {{interviews with}} John and Patsy Ramsey {{could provide the}} jumpstart that the stalled investigation of their daughter Jon-Benet 2 ̆ 7 s brutal murder needs, says UGA trial and criminal law expert Ron Carlson. 2 ̆ 2 These interviews are a positive sign, 2 ̆ 2 said Carlson. 2 ̆ 2 They signal {{to the public that}} the case remains under active investigation. Second, they bring the Ramseys together with the people responsible for solving this crime - the Boulder police. Such cooperation is virtually always helpful to law enforcement. Finally, while participation in these interviews may not conclusively establish the innocence of the Ramseys, the willingness of John and Patsy to sit for interrogation - which they are not required to do - does impress many people as conduct which is inconsistent with guilt. 2 ̆ 2 Carlson has previously criticized some Colorado police and prosecutors for their refusal to discuss certain aspects of the case, saying that the Ramseys had been 2 ̆ 2 so pilloried, so horribly tried in the media, that in fairness, some of the exonerating evidence should be disclosed. 2 ̆ 2 For example, he cites last fall 2 ̆ 7 s disclosures published by Newsweek magazine: 2 ̆ 2 Newsweek reported that DNA from tissue found under Jon-Benet 2 ̆ 7 s fingernails has not been matched to anyone in the family, 2 ̆ 2 said Carlson. 2 ̆ 2 Particularly when citizens have been subjected to trial by tabloid, careful and measured release of some of the investigative information which is helpful to the individual is in the public interest. 2 ̆ 2 The Monday interviews in Atlanta will be the first major sit-down by the Ramseys with the Boulder police in two years. It has been reported that a substantial <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>authorities</b> will arrive in Atlanta and that the Boulder police chief apparently has new questions and information - prospects Carlson views as encouraging. 2 ̆ 2 The interview potentially promises to be a pivotal step, 2 ̆ 2 he said. Carlson, a nationally recognized expert in evidence, trial practice and criminal procedure, has litigated many cases and has argued twice before the United States Supreme Court. He has written numerous books on trial techniques and provided extensive commentary for the national media in high-profile trials.
