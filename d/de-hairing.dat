Historically, fine-haired Cashmere goats have been called Capra hircus laniger, {{as if they were}} a subspecies of the domestic goat Capra hircus. However, they are now more commonly considered part of the domestic goat subspecies Capra aegagrus hircus. Cashmere goats produce a double fleece that consists of a fine, soft undercoat or underdown of hair mingled with a straighter and much coarser outer coating of hair called guard hair. For the fine underdown to be sold and processed further, it must be de-haired. <b>De-hairing</b> is a mechanical process that separates the coarse hairs from the fine hair. After <b>de-hairing,</b> the resulting [...] "cashmere" [...] is ready to be dyed and converted into textile yarn, fabrics and garments.|$|E
40|$|The strain Chryseobacterium sp. kr 6 {{shown to}} be useful for biotechnological {{purposes}} such as hydrolysis of poultry feathers and <b>de-hairing</b> of bovine pelts. The effect of temperature, initial pH and media composition on protease production by this keratinolytic strain was studied. The enzyme was produced between 25 and 37 ºC, with maximum activity and yield at 30 ºC. When protease production was tested in media with different initial pH, maximum activity was observed when cultivation was carried out at 30 ºC and initial pH ranging from 6. 0 to 8. 0. Higher activity was observed when feathers or feather meal were used as growth substrates, followed by soybean meal. The addition of carbohydrates or surfactants to feather broth resulted in decrease in keratinolytic activity...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} show the {{usefulness}} of theoretical tools of chemical engineering in natural polymer processing, namely on the example of white hide deliming. White hide is a consequent product in the processes in which raw hide is transformed into leather. It is produced in the <b>de-hairing</b> stage which follows the soaking operation. For next operation, tanning, {{it is necessary to}} remove calcium hydroxide from white hide. Mathematical descriptions of both non-chemical and chemical deliming are presented, concentration fields of the reacting chemicals described and the importance of the acido-basic boundary inside the white hide shown. Experimental determination of the effective diffusion coefficient is also included. The presented mathematical models can serve as a very good basis for rationalization of the deliming process, save considerable amounts of energies, deliming chemicals and technological water, and make the whole process more environmentally friendly...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This study {{aimed to}} isolate and {{identify}} a new local bacterial strain, able to completely degrade keratin-rich wastes into soluble and useful materials {{which can be}} used in many proposes. Bacterial keratinases are of particular interest because of their action on insoluble keratin substrates and generally on a broad range of protein substrates. These enzymes have been studied for <b>de-hairing</b> processes in the leather industry and hydrolysis of feather and keratin. Samples from poultry industry wastes, soil, water, fodder and feather were collected from different places in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Each sample was plated on feather meal 1 agar plates containing 5 g LG feather as the sole carbon and nitrogen source and the obtained colonies were selected, purified and their growth were detected on skimmed milk agar and feather meal broth media. The well grown isolates on feather meal agar which producing the largest clearing zone on skimmed milk plate were selected for keratinase assays. Out of 23 bacterial isolates, 7 isolates were selected. The best keratinase producing bacterium kera MS 21 was selected and identified based on morphological, physiological and some biochemical characteristics. It was recorded as a species belonging to the genus Pseudomonas and identified as Pseudomonas sp. The results of identification were confirmed by 16 S rDNA studies. Precipitation and purification of the keratinase enzyme in addition to factors affecting enzyme activity were studied. The enzyme molecular weight was determined to be of 30 KDa using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. The optimum temperature and pH were determined to be 37 °C and pH 8. 0, respectively. The effect of some proteases inhibitors and activators were also studied...|$|E
