5|$|In {{addition}} to the standard characters, six characters taken from the Grantha script, which {{was used in the}} Tamil region to write Sanskrit, are sometimes used to represent sounds not native to Tamil, that is, words adopted from Sanskrit, Prakrit and other languages. The traditional system prescribed by classical grammars for writing loan-words, which involves respelling them in accordance with Tamil phonology, remains, but is not always consistently applied. ISO 15919 is an international standard for the transliteration of Tamil and other <b>Indic</b> scripts into Latin characters. It uses diacritics to map the much larger set of Brahmic consonants and vowels to the Latin script. Tamil can be transliterated into English by using ISO 15919, since English language uses the Latin script for writing.|$|E
5|$|In the {{southern}} regions of Karnataka, the Western Gangas of Talakad were contemporaries of the Kadambas. The Kadambas and Gangas {{were followed by}} the imperial dynasties of the Badami Chalukya Empire, the Rashtrakuta Empire, the Western Chalukya Empire, the Hoysala Empire and the Vijayanagara Empire, all patronising the ancient <b>Indic</b> religions while showing tolerance to the new cultures arriving from {{the west of the}} subcontinent. The Muslim invasion of the Deccan resulted in the breaking away of the feudatory Sultanates in the 14th century. The rule of the Bahamani Sultanate of Bidar and the Bijapur Sultanate from the northern Deccan region caused a mingling of the ancient Hindu traditions with the nascent Islamic culture in the region. The hereditary ruling families and clans ably served the large empires and upheld the local culture and traditions. The fall of the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565 brought about a slow disintegration of Kannada-speaking regions into minor kingdoms that struggled to maintain autonomy in an age dominated by foreigners until unification and independence in 1947.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the most}} {{pronounced}} effects of Hellenization {{can be seen in}} Afghanistan and India, in the region of the relatively late-rising Greco-Bactrian Kingdom (250–125 BC) (in modern Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan) and the Indo-Greek Kingdom (180 BC – 10 CE) in modern Afghanistan and India. There on the newly formed Silk Road Greek culture apparently hybridized with Indian, and especially Buddhist culture. The resulting syncretism known as Greco-Buddhism heavily influenced the development of Buddhism and created a culture of Greco-Buddhist art. These Greco-Buddhist kingdoms sent some of the first Buddhist missionaries to China, Sri Lanka, and the Mediterranean (Greco-Buddhist monasticism). Some of the first and most influential figurative portrayals of the Buddha appeared at this time, perhaps modeled on Greek statues of Apollo in the Greco-Buddhist style. Several Buddhist traditions may have been influenced by the ancient Greek religion: the concept of Boddhisatvas is reminiscent of Greek divine heroes, and some Mahayana ceremonial practices (burning incense, gifts of flowers, and food placed on altars) are similar to those practiced by the ancient Greeks; however, similar practices were also observed amongst the native <b>Indic</b> culture. One Greek king, Menander I, probably became Buddhist, and was immortalized in Buddhist literature as 'Milinda'. The process of Hellenization also spurred trade between the east and west. For example, Greek astronomical instruments dating to the 3rd century BC were found in the Greco-Bactrian city of Ai Khanoum in modern-day Afghanistan, while the Greek concept of a spherical earth surrounded by the spheres of planets eventually supplanted the long-standing Indian cosmological belief of a disc consisting of four continents grouped around a central mountain (Mount Meru) like the petals of a flower. The Yavanajataka (lit. Greek astronomical treatise) and Paulisa Siddhanta texts depict the influence of Greek astronomical ideas on Indian astronomy.|$|E
25|$|South <b>Indic</b> letter {{forms are}} very rounded; North <b>Indic</b> less so, though Odia, Golmol and Litumol of Nepal script are rounded.|$|E
25|$|Most North <b>Indic</b> scripts' full letters {{incorporate}} a horizontal {{line at the}} top, with Gujarati and Odia as exceptions; South <b>Indic</b> scripts do not.|$|E
25|$|<b>Indic</b> scripts {{originated}} in India and spread to Southeast Asia. All surviving <b>Indic</b> scripts are {{descendants of the}} Brahmi alphabet. Today they are used in most languages of South Asia (although replaced by Perso-Arabic in Urdu, Kashmiri and some other languages of Pakistan and India), mainland Southeast Asia (Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia), and Indonesian archipelago (Javanese, Balinese, Sundanese, etc.). The primary division is into North <b>Indic</b> scripts used in Northern India, Nepal, Tibet and Bhutan, and Southern <b>Indic</b> scripts used in South India, Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia.|$|E
25|$|The Proto-Indo-European Creation myth {{seems to}} have {{involved}} two key figures: *Manu- ("Man"; <b>Indic</b> Manu; Germanic Mannus) and his twin brother *Yemo- ("Twin"; <b>Indic</b> Yama; Germanic Ymir). Reflexes of these two figures usually fulfill the respective roles of founder {{of the human race}} and first human to die.|$|E
25|$|The Brahmic {{family of}} abugidas {{is used for}} {{languages}} of the Indian subcontinent and south-east Asia. There is a long tradition {{in the west to}} study Sanskrit and other <b>Indic</b> texts in Latin transliteration. Various transliteration conventions have been used for <b>Indic</b> scripts since the time of Sir William Jones.|$|E
25|$|The {{alphabetical}} order of Hangul does not mix consonants and vowels as the Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek alphabets do. Rather, the order {{is that of}} the <b>Indic</b> type, first velar consonants, then coronals, labials, sibilants, etc. However, the vowels come after the consonants rather than before them as in the <b>Indic</b> systems.|$|E
25|$|Arta- {{sometimes}} {{appears as}} an element in Vedic and <b>Indic</b> personal names, as with Iranian.|$|E
25|$|With these <b>Indic</b> {{languages}} came scripts, {{including the}} Brahmi script (later adapted to write Tocharian) and the Kharosthi script.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} {{with all the}} other <b>Indic</b> scripts, Gujarati is written from left to right, and is not case-sensitive.|$|E
25|$|Although {{with some}} points of {{comparison}} such as shared etymology, <b>Indic</b> devá- is thematically different from Avestan daēva.|$|E

25|$|The most {{extensive}} remains are in Vedic Sanskrit and Old Avestan (the oldest recorded stages of oldest <b>Indic</b> and Iranian languages, c. 1300-1700 BC); younger {{stages of the}} same languages already show extensive regularization.|$|E
25|$|Prakrit {{documents}} from 3rd-century Krorän, Andir and Niya on the southeast {{edge of the}} Tarim Basin contain around 100 loanwords and 1000 proper names that cannot be traced to an <b>Indic</b> or Iranian source.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} phonological {{processes are}} not intended as an exhaustive description of the historical changes which produced Pali from its Old <b>Indic</b> ancestor, but rather are {{a summary of the}} most common phonological equations between Sanskrit and Pali, with no claim to completeness.|$|E
25|$|The {{vocabulary}} of Singlish consists of words originating from English, Malay, Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese, Tamil {{and to a}} lesser extent various other European, <b>Indic</b> and Sinitic languages.

25|$|Virtually {{every word}} in Pāḷi has {{cognates}} {{in the other}} Middle Indo-Aryan languages, the Prakrits. The relationship to Vedic Sanskrit is less direct and more complicated; the Prakrits were descended from Old Indo-Aryan vernaculars. Historically, influence between Pali and Sanskrit has been felt in both directions. The Pali language's resemblance to Sanskrit is often exaggerated by comparing it to later Sanskrit compositionswhich were written centuries after Sanskrit {{ceased to be a}} living language, and are influenced by developments in Middle <b>Indic,</b> including the direct borrowing of a portion of the Middle <b>Indic</b> lexicon; whereas, a good deal of later Pali technical terminology has been borrowed from the vocabulary of equivalent disciplines in Sanskrit, either directly or with certain phonological adaptations.|$|E
25|$|Another momentous {{process in}} Gowa and Talloq's early history was the {{introduction}} of writing {{in the form of}} the Makassar alphabet, knowledge of which was apparently widespread by 1605. However, the early history of the script remains shrouded in mystery. Although some historians have interpreted the Gowa Chronicle as stating that writing was unknown until the reign of Tumapaqrisiq Kallonna, it is generally thought that writing existed in the region some time prior to the sixteenth century. There is also universal agreement that the alphabet ultimately derives from an <b>Indic</b> source, although it remains an open question which <b>Indic</b> script had the greatest influence on the Makassar alphabet; the Javanese kawi script, the Batak and Rejang alphabets of Sumatra, and even the Gujarati script of western India have all been proposed.|$|E
25|$|Spanish (including Spanish Creole) is the second-most-spoken {{language}} in Maryland, after English. The third- and fourth-most-spoken languages are French (including Patois and Cajun) and Chinese. Other commonly spoken languages include various African languages, Korean, German, Tagalog, Russian, Vietnamese, Italian, various Asian languages, Persian, Hindi and other <b>Indic</b> languages, Greek and Arabic.|$|E
25|$|The Gurmukhi script has {{roots in}} the Brahmi script like most Indian, Tibetan, and Southeast Asian languages. In a cursory look, the Gurmukhi script appears {{different}} from other <b>Indic</b> scripts such as Bengali, Oriya, Tibetan or Devanagari, but a closer examination reveals they are similar except for angles and structural emphasis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Indic</b> scripts {{indicate}} vowels through dependent vowel signs (diacritics) {{around the}} consonants, often including {{a sign that}} explicitly indicates {{the lack of a}} vowel. If a consonant has no vowel sign, this indicates a default vowel. Vowel diacritics may appear above, below, to the left, to the right, or around the consonant.|$|E
25|$|Early Medieval (Gupta period) {{literature}} in India sees the flowering of Sanskrit drama, classical Sanskrit poetry and the compilation of the Puranas. Sanskrit {{declines in the}} early 2nd millennium, late works such as the Kathasaritsagara dating to the 11th century, {{to the benefit of}} literature composed in Middle <b>Indic</b> vernaculars such as Old Bengali, Old Hindi.|$|E
25|$|Learning Hebrew {{has been}} a great challenge, {{especially}} for the older generation, for whom the phonology of their native <b>Indic</b> and Sinitic languages makes Hebrew especially challenging. Younger members have had more opportunities to learn Hebrew, as they are more involved in society. Some have gained jobs as soldiers; others as nurses' aides for the elderly and infirm.|$|E
25|$|Six-pointed {{stars have}} also been found in cosmological {{diagrams}} in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. The reasons behind this symbol's common appearance in <b>Indic</b> religions and the West are unknown. One possibility {{is that they have}} a common origin. The other possibility is that artists and religious people from several cultures independently created the hexagram shape, which is a relatively simple geometric design.|$|E
25|$|<b>Indic</b> {{scholars}} distinguish 42 dialects of spoken Marathi. Dialects bordering {{other major}} language areas have many properties {{in common with}} those languages, further differentiating them from standard spoken Marathi. The bulk of the variation within these dialects is primarily lexical and phonological (e.g. accent placement and pronunciation). Although the number of dialects is considerable, the degree of intelligibility within these dialects is relatively high.|$|E
25|$|Aśoka's edicts (c. 265–238 BC) were {{committed}} to stone. These inscriptions are stiff and angular in form. Following the Aśoka style of <b>Indic</b> writing, two new calligraphic types appear: Kharoṣṭī and Brāhmī. Kharoṣṭī {{was used in the}} northwestern regions of India from the 3rd century BC to the 4th century of the Christian Era, and it was used in Central Asia until the 8th century.|$|E
25|$|The {{analysis}} of different Indo-European tales {{indicates that the}} Proto-Indo-Europeans believed there were two progenitors of mankind: * ("Man") and * ("Twin"), his twin brother. A reconstructed creation myth involving the two is given by David W. Anthony, attributed in part to Bruce Lincoln: Manu and Yemo traverse the cosmos, accompanied by the primordial cow, and finally decide to create the world. To do so, Manu sacrifices either Yemo or the cow, and {{with help from the}} sky father, the storm god and the divine twins, forges the earth from the remains. Manu thus becomes the first priest and establishes the practice of sacrifice. The sky gods then present cattle to the third man, *, who loses it to the three-headed serpent *, but eventually overcomes this monster either alone or aided by the sky father. Trito is now the first warrior and ensures that the cycle of mutual giving between gods and humans may continue. Reflexes of *Manu include <b>Indic</b> Manu, Germanic Mannus; of Yemo, <b>Indic</b> Yama, Avestan Yima, Norse Ymir, possibly Roman Remus (< earlier Old Latin *Yemos).|$|E
25|$|Because the {{concepts}} of khvarenah/khwarrah and Aramaic gd(y) circulated in the same areas and have many characteristics in common, {{it is possible that}} the Mesopotamian concept influenced the Zoroastrian one. On the other hand, khvarenah may also be a facet of Zoroastrianism's Indo-Iranian cultural inheritance since khvarenah appears to have a parallel in <b>Indic</b> tejas. in which kingship is likewise associated with the bright splendor and power of light and fire.|$|E
25|$|Some {{decorative}} typefaces, {{sometimes called}} simulation typefaces, {{have been designed}} that represent the characters of the Roman alphabet but evoke another writing system. This group includes typefaces designed to appear as Arabic, Chinese characters, Cyrillic (Faux Cyrillic), <b>Indic</b> scripts, Greek, Hebrew, Kana, or Thai. These are used largely {{for the purpose of}} novelty to make something appear foreign, or to make businesses such as restaurants offering foreign food clearly stand out.|$|E
25|$|With {{regards to}} directionality, Siddhaṃ texts were usually read from left-to-right then top-to-bottom, as with <b>Indic</b> languages, but {{occasionally}} {{they were written}} in the traditional Chinese style, from top-to-bottom then right-to-left. Bilingual Siddhaṃ-Japanese texts show the manuscript turned 90 degrees clockwise and the Japanese is written from top-to-bottom, as is typical of Japanese, and then the manuscript is turned back again, and the Siddhaṃ writing is continued from left-to-right (the resulting Japanese characters look sideways).|$|E
25|$|Punjabi Sufi poetry also {{influenced}} other Punjabi literary traditions particularly the Punjabi Qissa, a genre of romantic tragedy which also derived inspiration from <b>Indic,</b> Persian and Qur'anic sources. The Qissa of Heer Ranjha by Waris Shah (1706–1798) {{is among the}} most popular of Punjabi qisse. Other popular stories include Sohni Mahiwal by Fazal Shah, Mirza Sahiba by Hafiz Barkhudar (1658–1707), Sassi Punnun by Hashim Shah (1735?-1843?), and Qissa Puran Bhagat by Qadaryar (1802–1892).|$|E
