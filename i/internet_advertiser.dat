Recent negative trends in Internet advertising, such a. s "banner blindness " and extremely low click-through rates, make it imperative to study various factors affecting Internee ad avoidance. Accordingly, this study builds a comprehensive theoretical model explaining advertising avoidance on the Internet, We examined three latent variables of Internet ad avoidance: perceived goal impediment, perceived ad clutter, and prior negative experience. We found that these constructs successfully explain why people cognitively, affectively, and behaviorally avoid advertising messages on the Internet. Perceived goal impediment Is {{found to be the}} most significant antecedent explaining advertising avoidance on the Internet. The purpose of this research is ro engender a detailed explica-tion of what drives ad avoidance on the <b>Internet.</b> <b>Advertisers</b> and marketers have become disenchanted with the Internet for many reasons (Lanctot 2002).

Tracking these rogue advertisers is important to the Cyber Security cause, where in an ideal scenario individuals are exposed to correct information as is their basic right, along with their reaction toward the sensitivity of any content. In the past manual tracking has been the commonest method of checking but in some cases manual tracking could fail, other than time parameters the accuracy is also questionable, the solution to this the concept of Automatic URL Tracking. This thesis represents an analytical method of Automatic URL Tracking, according to this approach, where various pages are checked for advertising banners, these are clicked until the final URL or its destination is reached. To achieve various concrete results a significant work has been done to develop an Automatic URL Tracking Software which is run when connected through internet while holding the reported URLs databases where each of these are tracked to its final destination. The Automatic URL Tracking Software was run for the total of 2500 URL samples, upon manually tracking these URLs the two processes showed 87. 7 % agreement which can be reliable result considering the presence of various blocking techniques adopted by hosting sites and site developers but there are chances for further development where the application is enhanced specifically to overcome these obstacles.

40|$|Background: The ready {{availability}} of so-called natural remedies from Internet websites, together with mostly unsubstantiated claims {{as to their}} efficacy in treating various medical conditions, continues to give rise to serious safety concerns. Although the possibility of acute cyanide toxicity from ingestion of large quantities of apricot kernels is well documented, certain websites are still advocating this practice as a ‘natural’ treatment for cancer - even recommending consumption of 50 kernels daily.   Case report: A 48 year-old non-smoking female patient attended the emergency department complaining of nausea, headache, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. She was previously diagnosed with multiple endocrine neoplasia (type IIa) and had undergone a number of neck operations including recent removal of a medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. In an attempt to prevent further recurrence of her disease she had taken advice from a website advocating apricot kernel therapy. Initially she had been ingesting 10 kernels/day but this had been increased to 40 /day for the past week. She described having a terrible taste since commencing the therapy and that she now felt very unwell and ‘raw inside’. Examination revealed mild dehydration and an elevated plasma calcium concentration (2. 85 mmol/L). Blood cyanide concentration was normal but her serum thiocyanate concentration was 22. 6 mg/L (1 – 4 mg/L in non-smokers), a level consistent with that found in studies of patients ingesting 1500 mg amygdalin (the cyanogenic component of apricot kernels) daily. Following supportive care and intravenous fluids, her symptoms abated and she was discharged.   Discussion:  Analytical data provided by the Food Standards Agency indicate that bitter apricot kernels on sale in health shops in the UK contain on average 0. 5 mg of cyanide per kernel. This patient may therefore have been ingesting approximately 330 microgram/kg cyanide daily - uncomfortably close to the lower acute lethal dose limit in humans of 500 microgram/kg and 28 times the TDI (Tolerable Daily Intake) of 12 microgram/kg/day set by the WHO in 2003.

40|$|With the {{prosperity}} of the <b>Internet,</b> many <b>advertisers</b> choose to deliver their advertisements by online targeting, where the ad broker is responsible for matching advertisements with users {{who are likely to}} be interested in the underlying products or services. However, this online advertisement targeting system requires user profile information and may fail due to privacy issues. In light of growing privacy concerns, we propose a privacy-aware framework for online advertisement targeting, where users are compensated for their privacy leakage and motivated to click more advertisements. In the framework, an ad broker pays a varying amount of money to users for clicking different advertisements due to distinct privacy leakage. Meanwhile advertisers send advertisements to the ad broker and determine the price per user click they need to pay. We model the interactions among advertisers, the ad broker and users as a three-stage game, where every player aims at maximizing its own utility, and Nash Equilibrium is achieved by backward induction. We further analyze the optimal strategies for advertisers, the ad broker and users. Numerical results have shown that the proposed privacy-aware framework is effective as it enables all advertisers, the ad broker and users to maximize their utilities in case of different levels of user privacy sensitivities. In addition, the proposed framework produces higher profits for advertisers and the ad broker than the traditional 'paid to click' system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to classify the types of information in online advertising that Internet users prefer and to examine whether different forms of online advertisements cause disturbance in information searching prior to product purchases. The data were gathered by conducting surveys to college students in three universities in Taipei, Taichung, and Kaohsiung in Taiwan. The total valid samples were 283, out of 300 surveyed respondents. The mobile phone is used in this study as objects due to the familiarities of the products to college students and abundance of information provided online. The informativeness of online advertisements including dimensions of price/promotion, service, design, and function are what respondents intend to view. Due to the characteristics of the <b>Internet,</b> <b>advertisers</b> are able to utilize animated, colored, and interactive advertisements on Websites to draw attention of users. The concern is that certain advertisements disturb what users are currently doing online. This study intends to examine the reactions to different forms of online advertisements and to reveal whether respondents express feelings of annoyance for certain forms of online advertisements during information searching activities. Subsequent behavior of the respondents after verifying whether they are annoyed upon viewing certain types of online advertisements is examined. Respondents are categorized into two clusters, ad-neutral and ad-annoyed, using variables measuring annoyance of online advertisements while searching information of mobile phones. For respondents in the ad-neutral cluster, price/promotion and service are factors valued more importantly while viewing information in online advertisements. On the contrary, for respondents in the ad-annoyed cluster, design and function are more important factors than price/promotion and service in terms of information upon seeing online advertisements. Nearly all kinds of online advertisements cause annoyance to a certain level. For those young adults who do not have reactions of being disturbed by online advertisements, they tend to have subsequent behavior of ignoring the online advertisements. These results indicate Internet users are aware of online advertisements and understand the disturbance caused by online advertisements is unavoidable. In sum, if marketers or advertisers intend to design online advertisements that do not cause too much annoyance to the majority of Internet users, the banners or interstitials should be ideal. Certain types of online advertisements like pop-ups and mouse-tailing need to be used with caution. When Internet users are disturbed and the annoyance can be tolerated, the information searching behavior goes on. When Internet users are disturbed and the annoyance cannot be tolerated, the information searching behavior is terminated. The effort of designing online advertisements ended up with users' ignorance or termination can be wasted and useless. Marketers and advertisers not only try to attract attentions of online users with advertisements, but also need to restrict the annoyance or disturbance of online advertisements to an acceptable level to reduce the opportunities of being ignored or terminated.

Building on these advances, a rapid development of e-commerce has taken place which has resulted in the emergence of Internet as an important medium for advertising. Through a variety of technological advances, the <b>Internet</b> has allowed <b>advertisers</b> to address a targeted audience which in general was beyond the reach of traditional media. The Internet thus offers opportunities for advertisers to present advertisements to a captive audience based on various criteria. Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) on the other hand, help protect technologies via various means. The advancements made in field of information technology coupled with business methods can be protected by patents. Patent rights prevent others from practicing (making, using or selling) a claimed invention in a particular territory for a limited time during the life of the patent. Patents often are the first and many a times, the only source in which technology is revealed. Thus patents can act as important techno-legal documents, containing various different kinds of information related to technology and/or its advancements. In the present study, patents are used as source of information to understand how advancements in ICTs has influenced business and more particularly how the ICT is being used for internet based targeted advertising...|$|R

A similar, earlier idea of a conflated generic-item auction is an important component of the Combinatorial Clock Auction (Ausubel, Cramton and Milgrom, 2006), widely used in spectrum auctions including the UK's recent 800 MHz / 2.6 GHz auction, and has also been proposed for Incentive Auctions. [...] Bidders are allowed to express only the quantity of frequencies in the allocation stage of the auction without regard to the specific assignment (which is decided in a later assignment stage). Milgrom (2010) shows that with a certain “outcome closure property,” conflation adds no new unintended outcome as equilibrium and argued that, by thickening the markets, may intensify price competition and increase revenue.|$|R
