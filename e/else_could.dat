5|$|We {{marched to}} the place we called Cornhill, where we had found the corn before. At another place we had seen before, we dug and found some more corn, two or three baskets full, {{and a bag of}} beans....In all we had about ten bushels, which will be enough for seed. It is with God's help that we found this corn, for how <b>else</b> <b>could</b> we have done it, without meeting some Indians who might trouble us.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{two leaders}} had a strong relationship, by 1960 US {{officials}} were becoming concerned by what they viewed as Canadian procrastination on vital issues, such as whether Canada should join the Organization of American States (OAS). Talks on these issues in June 1960 produced little in results. Diefenbaker hoped that US Vice President Richard Nixon would win the 1960 US presidential election, but when Nixon's Democratic rival, Senator John F. Kennedy won the race, he sent Senator Kennedy a note of congratulations. Kennedy did not respond until Canadian officials asked {{what had become of}} Diefenbaker's note, two weeks later. Diefenbaker, for whom such correspondence was very meaningful, was annoyed at the President-elect's slowness to respond. In January 1961, Diefenbaker visited Washington to sign the Columbia River Treaty. However, with only days remaining in the Eisenhower administration, little <b>else</b> <b>could</b> be accomplished.|$|E
5|$|Aside from Nikki, Victor {{is known}} for his {{relationship}} with Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson). While Ashley was at a low point in her life, he had an affair with her. This led to her pregnancy, which he left Nikki for. However, Nikki was diagnosed with cancer and he returned to her, and Ashley aborted her baby; a move she regretted for many years. Ashley stole his sperm many years later, and had a child, Abby Carlton. Abby was believed to be Brad Carlton's (Don Diamont) daughter until she was five years old. Victor was married to Ashley from 1990 to 1993. In 2008, Victor married Sabrina Costelana (Raya Meddine), which was short-lived following her accidental death. Afterward, he left town and Ashley tracked him down when nobody <b>else</b> <b>could.</b> They reconnected their romantic relationship, later remarried and Ashley became pregnant. Davidson stated she was surprised by Ashley's pregnancy, but decided to like the storyline as it was unexpected. Victor and Ashley's second marriage ended after she miscarried the child.|$|E

5|$|The battle finally ceased when a shell from Virginia {{struck the}} pilot house of Monitor and exploded, driving {{fragments}} {{of paint and}} iron through the viewing slits into Worden's eyes and temporarily blinding him. As no one <b>else</b> <b>could</b> see to command the ship, Monitor was forced to draw off. The executive officer, Lieutenant Samuel Dana Greene, took over, and Monitor returned to the fight. In the period of command confusion, however, the crew of Virginia believed that their opponent had withdrawn. Although Minnesota was still aground, the falling tide meant that {{she was out of}} reach. Furthermore, Virginia had suffered enough damage to require extensive repair. Convinced that his ship had won the day, Jones ordered her back to Norfolk. At about this time, Monitor returned, only to discover her opponent apparently giving up the fight. Convinced that Virginia was quitting, with orders only to protect Minnesota and not to risk his ship unnecessarily, Greene did not pursue. Thus, each side misinterpreted the moves of the other, and as a result each claimed victory.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{explanation}} for the sinking among modern historians is that the ship was unstable {{for a number of}} reasons. When a strong gust of wind hit the sails at a critical moment, the open gunports proved fatal, the ship flooded and quickly foundered. Coates offered a variant of this hypothesis, which explains why a ship which served for several decades without sinking, and which even fought in actions in the rough seas off Brittany, unexpectedly foundered: the ship had accumulated additional weight over the years in service and finally become unseaworthy. That the ship was turning after firing all the cannons on one side has been questioned by Marsden after examination of guns recovered in both the 19th and 20th centuries; guns from both sides were found still loaded. This has been interpreted to mean that something <b>else</b> <b>could</b> have gone wrong since it is assumed that an experienced crew would not have failed to secure the gunports before making a potentially risky turn.|$|E
25|$|Bravo {{promised that}} he would write to the king immediately, and hoped that there matter would be {{properly}} settled there.

25|$|Linares {{received}} Mexico's National Arts and Sciences Award in the Popular Arts and Traditions {{category in}} 1990, {{two years before}} he died. This inspired other alebrije artists, and Linaresâ€™ work became prized both in Mexico and abroad.

25|$|Among the Timucua, a type {{of black}} drink was called cacina by the Spanish. The {{preparation}} and consumption of the drink were strictly limited to the community council house. Women (other than an occasional female chief) were normally excluded from the council house except for activities such as dances, but did prepare the cacina. In 1678 a bedridden cacica (a female chief) was given permission to brew and consume cacina in her house, {{on the condition that}} no one <b>else</b> <b>could</b> be present while she did so.|$|E
25|$|According to Yuen Yim Keung, {{there where}} three (3) two (2) minute rounds with a one (1) minute rest in between. The ring was five (5) metres in diameter, which was drawn in chalk, {{and as a}} result if the {{opponent}} went out of the ring more than three (3) times he would be announced as the loser. There were also no attacks to the eyes, throat or groin, but everything <b>else</b> <b>could</b> be applied. Also if there was excessive blood loss, then the injured fighter would be announced as the loser.|$|E

25|$|The 1st Experimental Guided Missiles Group, {{apart from}} {{receiving}} nationwide attention for completing the drone flight from Eglin to Washington D.C. on a simulated bombing mission, the Group received little notice {{in its own}} right. Without higher supply and personnel priorities, very little <b>else</b> <b>could</b> be accomplished. The situation began to change in March 1947, when the Group moved to Eglin's main base and received its first series of test projects. The Group was given the JB-2 and it got involved in VB-6 Felix, VB-3 Razon, and VB-13 Tarzon guided bomb activities.|$|E
25|$|Since none of {{the means}} of knowing were found to be worthy to {{establish}} the invariable connection between middle term and predicate, Charvakas concluded that the inference could not be used to ascertain metaphysical truths. Thus, to Charvakas, the step which the mind takes from the knowledge of something to infer the knowledge of something <b>else</b> <b>could</b> be accounted for by its being based on a former perception or by its being in error. Cases where inference was justified by the result were seen only to be mere coincidences.|$|E
25|$|It {{is little}} wonder that many desperate Devonians tried their luck abroad, with the sailing ship Elizabeth, Isabella and Margaret taking emigrants from Torquay Harbour to America and Canada. Those they left behind faced a bleak future of low pay in {{insecure}} employment with few rights. The basic diet of working-class families in those days consisted mainly of bread and whatever <b>else</b> <b>could</b> be had, usually cheese and a few vegetables, so when the staple food supply was scarce or too expensive to buy then just surviving was made even harder.|$|E

25|$|The most {{brilliant}} analysis ever {{done on a}} structural puzzle was surely the solution (1953) of the terramycin problem. It was a problem of great industrial importance, and hence many able chemists had performed {{an enormous amount of}} work trying to determine the structure. There seemed to be too much data to resolve the problem, because a significant number of observations, although experimentally correct, were very misleading. Woodward took a large piece of cardboard, wrote on it all the facts and, by thought alone, deduced the correct structure for terramycin. Nobody <b>else</b> <b>could</b> have done that at the time.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 19 January 1799, Grampus was in the Thames and {{under the command of}} Captain John Hall. She weighed at 7a.m., and took a pilot, Sammuel Richardson, on board. Nevertheless, by 9a.m. she had {{grounded}} on the Barking Shelf. She could not be refloated and so for the next three days work went on to remove her stores, her masts, and whatever <b>else</b> <b>could</b> be salvaged. On 21 January {{the decision was made to}} abandon her as by then she had 20 feet of water in her hold. The subsequent court martial absolved Captain Hall and his officers and crew of any responsibility, instead blaming Richardson's ignorance.|$|E
25|$|During {{the initial}} {{development}} {{to get the}} film made, Jack Nicholson and Marlon Brando were originally considered for the roles of Duke and Gonzo but they both grew too old. Afterward, Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi were considered for the duo, but that fell apart when Belushi died. John Malkovich was later considered {{for the role of}} Duke, but he grew too old too. At one point John Cusack was almost cast (Cusack had previously directed the play version of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, with his brother playing Duke). However, after Hunter S. Thompson met with Johnny Depp he became convinced that no one <b>else</b> <b>could</b> play him. When Cox and Davies started writing the screenplay, Depp and del Toro committed to starring in the film.|$|E

25|$|Little {{is known}} of the {{activities}} of Carthage between 405 and 397 BC, during which time Dionysius had muscled his way through Sicily and had already broken an existing treaty by making war on the Sicels. Carthage may have been weakened by the plague brought over from Sicily in 405. When Motya was put under siege and most cities in Sicily broke free of Carthaginian control, Carthage sent the aforementioned naval force under Himilco, which achieved nothing. Carthage {{did not have a}} standing army, so nothing <b>else</b> <b>could</b> be done before enough mercenaries had been hired and marshalled. Carthage had begun to recruit an army and man a fleet to send to Sicily. The final army may have included 50,000 infantry, 4,000 cavalry, 400 chariots, while the fleet included 400 Triremes and 600 transports.|$|E
25|$|With another World War looming, 1939 was the {{beginning}} of a difficult period, not just for Pinchon and other artists, but for the vast majority of the world's nations. Pinchon was deeply saddened by the human folly that would lead to such a turn of events. Neither he nor anyone <b>else</b> <b>could</b> have imagined the human loss and destruction that would be unleashed on Rouen. Yet despite the carnage that followed, hope and optimism had not entirely vanished. The 30th Salon des artistes rouennais went ahead as scheduled, with its opening on 19 May 1940; however, due to the gravity of the situation, it was closed two days later. The first bombardment of the city began on June 5, followed by a mass exodus. On June 8 at 10:00p.m. the first German tanks rolled in on la route de Neufchatel, very close to the Pinchon residence.|$|E
25|$|The Mears Newz was {{published}} by Swift Lathers, its founder and editor. Lathers was well-skilled in English and grammar, benefiting from training by his mother, an English teacher. Lathers worked as a stringer for a Detroit newspaper, where he grew to dislike the constant editing of his writing by others. He was then motivated {{to start his own}} newspaper where no one <b>else</b> <b>could</b> edit his writing. Moving from the Detroit area to Mears in 1909, Lathers started The Mears News (he initially spelled the word News in the name with an s) and believed it was his life's calling to report on items related to Mears, his adopted hometown. His simple meager lifestyle sacrificed personal financial gain to keep his newspaper going. Lathers wrote all his own stories and reports. He printed the newspapers on a foot operated printing press. Lathers would hand deliver the newspapers himself locally.|$|E
