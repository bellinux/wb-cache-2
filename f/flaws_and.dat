5|$|Leighton Meester, who {{portrayed the}} {{character}} in the television drama, has described Blair as being insecure about her social status.

5|$|The Texian {{army was}} {{a force of}} 810 volunteers and staff at this point, but few had any {{military}} training and experience. Faced with past desertions, discipline <b>flaws,</b> <b>and</b> individual indecisiveness of volunteers in training, Houston knew they were {{not yet ready to}} engage the Mexican army. Compounding the situation were the civilian refugees dependent upon the army for their protection. The news of Fannin's capture, combined with his doubts about the readiness of the Texian army, led Houston to order a retreat on March 26. Some of the troops viewed the decision as cowardice with Sesma sitting just {{on the other side of}} the Colorado, and several hundred men deserted.|$|E
5|$|The hardest natural {{diamonds}} mostly {{originate from}} the Copeton and Bingara fields {{located in the}} New England area in New South Wales, Australia. These diamonds are generally small, perfect to semiperfect octahedra, and are used to polish other diamonds. Their hardness {{is associated with the}} crystal growth form, which is single-stage crystal growth. Most other diamonds show more evidence of multiple growth stages, which produce inclusions, <b>flaws,</b> <b>and</b> defect planes in the crystal lattice, all of which affect their hardness. It is possible to treat regular diamonds under a combination of high pressure and high temperature to produce diamonds that are harder than the diamonds used in hardness gauges.|$|E

5|$|Upon release, Halo: The Flood {{cracked the}} Publishers Weekly Top Ten Bestsellers List for Paperbacks, but {{critical}} reception {{to the novel}} was less positive than Eric Nylund's Fall of Reach or other Halo novels. The repetitive fight scenes and dramatically different characterization of the protagonist compared to Nylund's work were seen as major <b>flaws,</b> <b>and</b> Dietz's style of writing was alternatively praised and lambasted. The next Halo novel, , would serve {{to bridge the gap}} between Combat Evolved and its sequel, Halo 2.|$|E
5|$|Work {{began in}} about 1735 and {{continued}} until Dashwood's death in 1781, when the older {{house had been}} transformed inside and out. The long building time partly explains the <b>flaws</b> <b>and</b> variations in design: when building commenced, Palladianism was the height of fashion, {{but by the time}} of its completion, Palladianism had been succeeded by Neoclassicism; thus, the house is a marriage of both styles. While the marriage is not completely unhappy, the Palladian features are marred by the lack of Palladio's proportions: the east portico is asymmetrical with the axis of the house, and trees were planted either side to draw the eye away from the flaw.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{protection}} scheme of the Yamato class still suffered from several major design <b>flaws</b> <b>and</b> shortcomings. The torpedo defense system performed substantially worse than designed; in particular, very poor jointing between the upper-belt and lower-belt armour created a rupture-prone seam {{just below the}} waterline, causing the class to be susceptible to torpedoes. Other structural weaknesses existed near {{the bow of the}} vessels, where the armour plating was generally thinner. These deficiencies proved crucial, particularly for the first two members of the class when they were each seriously damaged by submarine torpedoes in 1943 and then sunk by torpedo bombers in 1944–45. The hull of the Shinano was subject to even greater structural weaknesses, being hastily constructed {{near the end of the}} war and having been equipped with incomplete armour and unsealed watertight compartments at the time of her sinking.|$|E

5|$|I think {{everyone}} who disses the Columbine RPG is gutless. Most haven't played the game, or have played it with such preconceptions that they're blinded to the genuis , the honesty, {{the beauty of}} its social commentary. Super Columbine Massacre RPG is riddled with design <b>flaws</b> <b>and</b> has mediocre graphics by 1995, the maker of the game admits this, but it regardless {{is a work of}} art. It puts you in the mindset of the killers and provides a very clear suggestion of why they did what they did; they were enacting an ideological demonstration through a terrorist act, and the game shines light on this as an indictment of the American dream and way of life painfully close to the main nerve.|$|E
5|$|Industrial use of {{diamonds}} {{has historically been}} associated with their hardness, which makes diamond the ideal material for cutting and grinding tools. As the hardest known naturally occurring material, diamond {{can be used to}} polish, cut, or wear away any material, including other diamonds. Common industrial applications of this property include diamond-tipped drill bits and saws, and the use of diamond powder as an abrasive. Less expensive industrial-grade diamonds, known as bort, with more <b>flaws</b> <b>and</b> poorer color than gems, are used for such purposes. Diamond is not suitable for machining ferrous alloys at high speeds, as carbon is soluble in iron at the high temperatures created by high-speed machining, leading to greatly increased wear on diamond tools compared to alternatives.|$|E
5|$|Killian has {{manipulated}} American {{intelligence agencies}} regarding the Mandarin's location, luring James Rhodes– the former War Machine, now re-branded as the Iron Patriot– {{into a trap}} to steal the armor. With Harley's help, Stark traces the Mandarin to Miami and infiltrates his headquarters using improvised weapons. Inside he discovers the Mandarin is actually an English actor named Trevor Slattery, who says he is oblivious to the actions carried out in his image. Killian, who appropriated Hansen's Extremis research as a cure for his own disability and expanded the program to include injured war veterans, reveals he is the real Mandarin, using Slattery as a cover. After capturing Stark, Killian shows him Potts (whom he had kidnapped) being subjected to Extremis, {{in order to gain}} Stark's aid to fix Extremis's <b>flaws</b> <b>and</b> thus save Potts. Killian kills Hansen when she has a change of heart and tries to stop him.|$|E

5|$|The Windows {{version of}} the game had a more mixed reception, with {{criticism}} aimed mostly at the technical issues present {{at the time of}} the game's release, ultimately leading to sales being suspended. On June 23, 2015, the launch day for Arkham Knight, thousands of users reported major technical <b>flaws</b> <b>and</b> performance problems with the Windows {{version of the}} game, with some saying it seemed like the optimization phase of the game's development was skipped. Steam users immediately wrote scathing reviews of the game's performance, including reports of frame rate being capped at 30 frames per second (which could be raised, though with potential side effects) and dropping as low as 10 frames per second while gliding or using the Batmobile.|$|E
5|$|A {{short run}} of Gran Trak systems was {{produced}} in March 1974 and revealed other design problems, such as the steering controls; in their prototype system, Eigen used real a real car steering wheel and pedals, but the production run used different parts. Alcorn returned to Cyan that month and redesigned the game to fix the <b>flaws</b> <b>and</b> use more standard parts; the copying protection scheme was changed to use a custom-designed integrated circuit that was named {{the same as a}} standard Texas Instruments integrated circuit. Alcorn later stated in an interview that neither Warman nor Emmons understood the challenges in converting a prototype design to a product that could be manufactured. The game entered production soon after, and Atari announced it was shipping a full production run in May 1974. Although the design flaws were fixed, the communication problems during development led to one final problem with the game: Atari was unclear on the actual cost of producing the game. As a result, a single Gran Trak game ended up costing US$1,095 to manufacture, while Atari was selling them to distributors for only $995, losing $100 per sale. Atari soon corrected the problem, but ended the fiscal year with a large loss {{due in part to the}} financial failure of the game.|$|E
