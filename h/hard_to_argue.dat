Paul Kott of AllMusic commented that [...] "Undisputed Attitude, while not perfect, is a fitting tribute to the bands that inspired Slayer to break from the traditional metal mold." [...] Sandy Masuo of Rolling Stone reasoned: [...] "some punk purists will undoubtedly cry foul, but when the dust settles it's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> with Slayer's mettle."

He told Bloomberg News that [...] "People say that we are responsible for the situation we find ourselves in. OK, sure. But I think that Germany will find it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> that in 1953 [...] they were completely blameless." [...] He appeared in various international media as a spokesperson for Syriza and making the case for their policies: among others, he was interviewed on Lateline, an Australian news programme on ABC, by SBS, another Australian news channel, was quoted by the BBC and Bloomberg, and also appeared in an Intelligence Squared debate arguing for the motion 'Angela Merkel is Destroying Europe'.|$|E

500|$|Once Lowe {{joined the}} {{permanent}} cast, Chris' role changed into {{more of an}} authority figure concerned with integrity and efficiency, although he continued to maintain his positive attitude and personality. Schur said of this second role: [...] "He doesn’t like frayed ends or controversies [...] he wants the body politic to be as clean-running and organic as his own human body. Part of {{the design of the}} character was to give the other characters a true boss [...] an actual authority figure whose rules and regulations meant they had to toe certain lines, even while his endlessly cheery disposition made it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> with him." [...] As a result, Chris Traeger changed in minor ways once he became a regular character. In his earlier episodes, Chris avoided associating himself with anything negative and constantly made Ben report bad news to people. As city manager in later episodes as a regular, however, Chris started imposing rules or changes around the office that were not popular and seemed less resistant about enforcing them. For example, Chris began to enforce his strict no-dating policy around city hall. Additionally, in the episode [...] "Jerry's Painting", Chris forcefully orders Leslie to destroy a painting when it proves to be controversial, and becomes angry with her when she tries to resist those orders.|$|E

500|$|The {{selection}} of one particular quote in Carr's essay from pathologist Bruce Friedman, {{a member of}} the faculty of the University of Michigan Medical School, who commented on a developing difficulty reading books and long essays and specifically the novel War and Peace, was criticized for having a bias toward narrative literature. The quote failed to represent other types of literature, such as technical and scientific literature, which had, in contrast, become much more accessible and widely read {{with the advent of the}} Internet. At the Britannica Blog, writer Clay Shirky pugnaciously observed that War and Peace was [...] "too long, and not so interesting", further stating that [...] "it would be <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> that the last ten years have seen a decrease in either the availability or comprehension of material on scientific or technical subjects". Shirky's comments on War and Peace were derided by several of his peers as verging on philistinism. In Shirky's defense, inventor W. Daniel Hillis asserted that, although books [...] "were created to serve a purpose", that [...] "same purpose can often be served by better means". While Hillis considered the book to be [...] "a fine and admirable device", he imagined that clay tablets and scrolls of papyrus, in their time, [...] "had charms of their own". Wired magazine editor Kevin Kelly believed that the idea that [...] "the book is the apex of human culture" [...] should be resisted. And Birkerts differentiated online reading from literary reading, stating that in the latter the reader is directed within themselves and enters [...] "an environment that is nothing at all like the open-ended information zone that is cyberspace" [...] in which he feels psychologically fragmented.|$|E

40|$|Sustainable {{tourism is}} the result of the melange between tourism and {{sustainable}} tourism. The concept has evolved during the last decades of the twentieth century, in international conferences, summits etc. organized by the World Tourism Organization, the United Nations and other international organizations where it was defined, characterized and criticized. Unfortunately, the concept was not able to overcome its theoretical conceptualization and it did not reach practitioners of the tourism industry. Sustainable tourism has several forms which are actually practiced by tourists all over the world: ecotourism, backpacking, rural tourism, nature-based tourism, pro-poor tourism, volunteer tourism etc. In the present paper, we have focused on an area in Apuseni Mountains, Romania. We tried to identify the forms of sustainable tourism most suitable for this area considering: natural resources, socio-economical development, protected areas, gastronomic traditions etc. After considering all these we have selected three forms: ecotourism, volunteer tourism and slow tourism, which could have the highest impact in promoting this area, and actually all the Apuseni Mountains as an important destination for sustainable tourism. The arguments for ecotourism are based on the numerous natural tourism resources> caves, gorges, forests and wildlife. Volunteers are needed especially in conservation and English language course. For slow tourism, there are numerous trails for walking and biking. Also there are several foods, mainly based on milk and wild berries that should be promoted and sold under the slow food brand. The shortcomings of the research are the lack of quantitative and qualitative results, as there is no information regarding the number of tourists which visit the area during each year. Also, it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> compare the benefits of sustainable tourism with those of mass tourism, due to the lack of references. So it is <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> for sustainable tourism and its forms to the detriment of mass tourism...|$|R

2500|$|Despite the group's successes, {{there has}} been {{criticism}} of PETA from both the conservative and radical ends of the animal rights movement. Michael Specter writes that it provides for {{groups such as the}} Humane Society of the United States the same dynamic that Malcolm X provided for Martin Luther King, or Andrea Dworkin for Gloria Steinem—someone radical to alienate the mainstream and make moderate voices more appealing. The failure to condemn the Animal Liberation Front triggers complaints from the conservatives, while the more radical activists say the group has lost touch with its grassroots, is soft on the idea of animal rights, and that it should stop the media stunts, the pie-throwing, and the use of nudity.

2500|$|The {{group has}} been the focus of controversy, both inside and outside the animal rights movement. Newkirk and, formerly, Pacheco are seen as the leading {{exporters}} of animal rights to the more traditional animal-protection groups in the United States, but sections of the movement nonetheless say that PETA is not radical enough—law professor Gary Francione lists the group among what he calls [...] "the new welfarists," [...] arguing that its work with industries to achieve reform, which continues in the tradition of Henry Spira, makes it an animal welfare group, not an animal rights group. Newkirk told Salon in 2001 that PETA works toward the ideal but tries in the meantime to provide carrot-and-stick incentives."What I say to myself all the time is that we have our heads in the clouds looking for Utopia, but we have our feet firmly planted on the ground dealing with reality. We make no bones about the fact that we want an end to all cruelty to animals. But I think the meat industry and the leather industry and the experimenters understand, especially if we're fighting them, that we will back off if they move society and their industry a step forward. We're not going to stop everything overnight, so while we work for the ideal we certainly wish to provide the carrot-and-stick incentives to move along toward that goal."Animals are going to die by the millions today in all sorts of ugly ways for all sorts of ridiculous, insupportable reasons. If one animal who is lying in a battery egg farm cage could have the extra room to stretch her wing today because of something you've done, I think she would choose to have that happen." [...] There has also been criticism from feminists within the movement about the use of scantily clad women in PETA's anti-fur campaigns and others, but as Norm Phelps notes, [...] "Newkirk has been consistent in her response. No one, she says, is being exploited. Everyone ... is an uncoerced volunteer. Sexual attraction is a fact of life, and if it can advance the animals' cause, she makes no apologies for using it." [...] Also, Phelps notes that some activists believe that the group's media stunts trivialize animal rights, but he qualifies this by saying, [...] "t's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> with success and PETA is far and away the most successful cutting-edge animal rights organization in the world." [...] Newkirk's view is that PETA has a duty to be [...] "press sluts." [...] She argues, [...] "It is our obligation. We would be worthless if we were just polite and didn't make any waves." [...] PETA has also faced criticism for it's targeting of children, such as distributing comic books entitled Your Mommy Kills Animals.|$|E
2500|$|Adrian Ballinger and Cory Richards were {{sponsored}} by Eddie Bauer to climb Everest, and they relayed {{information from the}} Everest climb using the smartphone software application and service Snapchat. Mount Everest has had a 3G wireless data communication network since 2010. One {{of the things that}} was reported by them, was that bottled oxygen was stolen from them and there was some bad behaviour up there. The bottled oxygen was there for emergency back-up if they ran into trouble. Cory Richards summited Mount Everest without oxygen and returned safely, and Adrian made it almost to the top also. Another famous mountaineer, British climber Kenton Cool achieved his 12th Everest summit (the second-highest number of Everest summitings for a foreigner after Dave Hahn), and US celebrity mountaineer Melissa Arnot, completed her sixth summit, and achieved her personal goal of climbing Everest without supplementary bottled oxygen. This also turned out to be the most summits for a foreign female (not Nepali or Chinese), and one of the first US women to summit and survive without supplementary oxygen. In 1998 Francys Arsentiev had made it to the summit, but died during the descent; she went on to become a famous corpse as a landmark known as [...] "Sleeping Beauty" [...] until she was buried on Everest in 2007 by one of the people who had tried to help her. Another woman from the Americas, the Ecuadorian woman Carla Perez also summited Mount Everest in 2016 without supplementary oxygen. Perez and Arnot became the fifth and sixth women to summit Everest without supplementary oxygen. There is an ongoing discussion about the use of extra bottled oxygen in mountaineering. Also at issue is Dexamethasone (Dex), which is valuable as a lifesaver as it reduces swelling in the brain if someone comes down with high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE). When American Bill Burke was interviewed for his attempt, he noted how one of his team members had overdosed on Dex, prompting a medical evacuation even as in his more recent expedition, someone had 25 doses of Dex. He also noted it was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> against large supplies of Dex, due its life-saving properties against some types of altitude sickness, especially HACE. An example of a death in which Dex was implicated was Dr. Eberhard Schaaf in 2012 on Everest. Schaaf died on descent at the south summit from altitude sickness. It has a good reputation as a life saver, and is commonly given to Everest climbers for its ability to intervene in last desperate moments when altitude sickness sets in. For example, in the 2016 season Robert Gropel said he gave Dex to his wife (as reported by the Telegraph) in attempt to save her as they tried to descend Everest. Of course, Dex is just the tip of the iceberg, with the UIAA noting the aforementioned dexamethasone, but also [...] acetazolamide (aka Diamox), amphetamine, and alcohol use; and another noted Diamox (acetazolamide) use among trekkers. It is not really a matter of some authorities being for or against medications, but awareness, as misuse can cause drug interactions and various side effects. [...] In particular it was noted that supplementary oxygen significantly lowers death rate on ultra-high altitude mountain climbing, and is generally not regulated as a drug, whereas the safe use of medications is less understood or even acknowledged in many cases.
