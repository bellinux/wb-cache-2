5|$|In Japan, {{health care}} is {{provided}} by national and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee.

Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance. Patients are free to select the physicians or facilities of their choice.|$|E
30|$|Finally, the {{introduction}} of public <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>programs</b> can lead to problems of moral hazard, which refers {{to the effect of}} insurance on the behavior of the insured.

5|$|President Bill Clinton {{proposed}} a healthcare reform bill in 1993 {{that included a}} mandate for employers to provide health insurance to all employees through a regulated marketplace of health maintenance organizations. Republican Senators {{proposed a}}n alternative that would have required individuals, but not employers, to buy insurance. Ultimately the Clinton plan failed amid an unprecedented barrage of negative advertising funded by politically conservative groups and the health insurance industry and due to concerns that it was overly complex. Clinton negotiated a compromise with the 105th Congress to instead enact the State Children's <b>Health</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Program</b> (SCHIP) in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Along with Senators Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch, Clinton was a {{force behind}} {{the passage of the}} State Children's <b>Health</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Program</b> in 1997, a federal bill that gave state support to {{children}} whose parents could not provide them health coverage and conducted outreach efforts on behalf of enrolling children in the program once it became law. She promoted nationwide immunization against childhood diseases and encouraged older women to get a mammogram for breast cancer screening, with coverage provided by Medicare. She successfully sought to increase research funding for prostate cancer and childhood asthma at the National Institutes of Health.

30|$|Thus, {{there appears}} to be a {{trade-off}} between the expansion of subsidized <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>programs</b> and workers’ choices of informal employment. Given the high rates of informality in LAC and the need to expand access to healthcare to the uninsured, long-term evaluation of the impact of publicly subsidized <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>programs</b> on the informal market is a research priority. Along these lines, it is also crucial to assess the effects of these programs on health status. The empirical evidence on the extent to which public <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>programs</b> improve <b>health</b> outcomes is very limited (Sloan and Hsieh 2012).|$|R

5|$|Clinton {{presided over}} the longest period of peacetime {{economic}} expansion in American history and signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement, but failed to pass his plan for national health care reform. In the 1994 elections, the Republican Party won unified control of the Congress {{for the first time}} in 40 years. In 1996, Clinton became the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected to a second full term. Clinton passed welfare reform and the State Children's <b>Health</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Program,</b> as well as financial deregulation measures, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. In 1998, Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives for matters related to a scandal that involved White House employee Monica Lewinsky. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in 1999 and proceeded to complete his term in office. Clinton is only the second U.S. president to ever be impeached. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency, the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus, the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, signed the Iraq Liberation Act in opposition to Saddam Hussein, and participated in the 2000 Camp David Summit to advance the Israeli–Palestinian peace process.|$|E
5|$|In the January 1997 State of the Union address, Clinton {{proposed}} a new initiative {{to provide health}} coverage to up to five million children. Senators Ted Kennedy—a Democrat—and Orrin Hatch—a Republican—teamed up with Hillary Rodham Clinton and her staff in 1997, and succeeded in passing legislation forming the State Children's <b>Health</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Program</b> (SCHIP), the largest (successful) health care reform in {{the years of the}} Clinton Presidency. That year, Hillary Clinton shepherded through Congress the Adoption and Safe Families Act and two years later she succeeded in helping pass the Foster Care Independence Act. He negotiated the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 by the Republican Congress. In October 1997, he announced he was getting hearing aids, due to hearing loss attributed to his age, and his time spent as a musician in his youth. In 1999 Clinton signed into law the Financial Services Modernization Act also known as the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, which repealed the part of the Glass–Steagall Act that had prohibited a bank from offering a full range of investment, commercial banking, and insurance services since its enactment in 1933.|$|E
25|$|In {{the face}} of {{increasing}} loss {{and the need for}} cost containment, NHI changed the payment system from fee-for-service to a global budget, a kind of prospective payment system, in 2002. Taiwan's success with a single-payer <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>program</b> is owed, in part, to the country's human resources and the government's organizational skills, allowing for the effective and efficient management of the government-run <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>program.</b>|$|E
30|$|However, the {{potential}} benefits of <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>programs</b> depend on the details of the <b>program</b> design. <b>Health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>programs</b> differ greatly in their coverage. Some programs offer coverage for catastrophic health shocks that are life-threatening and require hospitalization or costly medication.

40|$|Medicine {{benefits}} through <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>programs</b> {{have the}} potential to improve access to and promote more effective use of affordable, high quality medicines. Information is lacking about medicine benefits provided by <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>programs</b> in Sub-Saharan Africa. We describe the structure of medicine benefits and data routinely available for decision-making in 33 <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>programs</b> in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda. Most programs surveyed were private, for profit schemes covering voluntary enrollees, mostly in urban areas. Almost all provide both inpatient and outpatient medicine benefits, with members sharing the cost of medicines in all programs. Some programs use strategies that are common in high-income countries to manage the medicine benefits, such as formularies, generics policies, reimbursement limits, or price negotiation. Basic data to monitor performance in delivering medicine benefits are available in most programs, but key data elements and the resources needed to generate useful management information from the available data are typically missing. Many questions remain unanswered about the design, implementation, and effects of specific medicines policies in the emerging and expanding <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>programs</b> in Sub-Saharan Africa. These include questions about the most effective medicines policy choices, given different corporate and organizational structures and resources; impacts of specific benefit designs on quality and affordability of care and health outcomes; and ways to facilitate use of routine data for monitoring. Technical capacity building, strong government commitment, and international donor support will be needed to realize the benefits of medicines coverage in emerging and expanding <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>programs</b> in Sub-Saharan Africa. <b>Health</b> <b>insurance</b> Sub-Saharan Africa Medicine benefits...|$|R

25|$|Poland's {{healthcare}} system {{is based on}} an all-inclusive insurance system.

30|$|<b>Health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>programs</b> {{can also}} {{mitigate}} moral hazard by requiring providers to follow specified protocols for care, and by covering only {{a list of}} essential healthcare services. Still {{another way is to}} increase cost sharing, that is, the share of the payment to the provider that the insured consumer bears. While the increase in cost sharing increases expenditure, it reduces moral hazard. Thus, using tools to balance moral hazard and risk protection are important for the design of public <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>programs.</b>|$|R

30|$|<b>Health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>programs</b> {{have the}} {{potential}} to improve healthcare quality and efficiency by creating a new institutional interface between healthcare consumers and suppliers, which improves the governance of healthcare management. The new institutional arrangements can help healthcare consumers coordinate their demands and negotiate better contractual arrangements. Further efficiency gains may be obtained when <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>programs</b> encourage households to make more efficient use of the healthcare system. For instance, by covering primary care visits, <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> can encourage households to enter the healthcare system at an earlier stage of illness, when treatment is more effective and less costly (Schaffner 2013).|$|R
25|$|In the US, direct {{government}} funding {{of health care}} is limited to Medicare, Medicaid, and the State Children's <b>Health</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Program</b> (SCHIP), which cover eligible senior citizens, the very poor, disabled persons, and children.

25|$|States may bundle {{together}} {{the administration of}} Medicaid with other {{programs such as the}} Children's <b>Health</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Program</b> (CHIP), so the same organization that handles Medicaid in a state may also manage the additional programs.

30|$|The {{logic of}} <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> market {{failures}} suggests that where households must pay significant user fees for healthcare, governments {{may be able}} to increase healthcare utilization and reduce the financial burden associated with care by introducing new <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>programs</b> (Schaffner 2013). As always, while logic suggests the potential for <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>programs</b> to generate benefits at low cost, it does not guarantee that in practice the benefits will be large and the cost low. The nature and magnitude of the impact of such programs are likely to depend on the details of program design, as will be discussed in the following subsection.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{development}} of medical expense insurance, patients were expected to pay all other health care costs {{out of their own}} pockets, under {{what is known as the}} fee-for-service business model. During the middle to late 20th century, traditional disability insurance evolved into modern <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>programs.</b> Today, most comprehensive private <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>programs</b> cover the cost of routine, preventive, and emergency health care procedures, and also most prescription drugs, but this was not always the case. The rise of private insurance was accompanied by the gradual expansion of public <b>insurance</b> <b>programs</b> for those who could not acquire coverage through the market.|$|R
30|$|In sum, {{over the}} past three decades the region has seen {{important}} reforms that sought to improve health systems. However, the norm is still mixed and fragmented models in which contributory and noncontributory <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>programs</b> coexist. One of the implications of this situation is low financial protection for individuals. In addition, the increase in informal labor poses great challenges to achieving universal healthcare coverage. This is especially relevant taking into account the high prevalence of NCDs, which require effective <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>programs</b> that provide coverage for long-term treatment.|$|R
25|$|The current {{program was}} {{implemented}} in 1995, {{and is considered}} to be a form of social insurance.

40|$|Abstract: We used panel {{data from}} the Indonesian Family Life Survey to {{investigate}} the impact of <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>programs</b> on reducing out-of-pocket expenditures. We employed three linear panel data models, two of which accounted for endogeneity: pooled ordinary least squares (OLS), pooled two-stage least squares (2 SLS) for instrumental variable (IV), and fixed effects (FE). The study revealed that two <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>programs</b> had a significantly negative impact on out-of-pocket expenditures by using IV estimates.

By doing so, workers can avoid having to make otherwise mandatory contributions to the social <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> system while receiving some free services under the new program. However, there is scarce robust empirical evidence, based on randomized control trials, of the actual effect of these programs on workers’ choices of formal or informal employment in the region.|$|R
