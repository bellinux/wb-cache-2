5|$|Dragon Warriors release {{has been}} noted as a notable turning point in video game history. The game has been listed as a genre builder for RPGs. Its {{popularity}} in Japan is synonymous with RPGs. While the game's elements <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>present</b> in previous RPG titles, Dragon Warrior set the template for others; almost all of its elements became the foundation for nearly every later game of the genre, from gameplay to narrative, replacing D as the model to follow. According to Shigeru Miyamoto, the success of Dragon Warrior {{changed the nature of}} video game development by making scenario writers far more important.|$|E

5|$|During the investigation, an {{examination}} of the pylon attachment points revealed damage to the wing's pylon mounting bracket that matched the shape of the pylon's rear attachment fitting. This meant that the pylon attachment fitting had struck the mounting bracket at some point. This was important evidence, as the only way the pylon fitting could strike the wing's mounting bracket in the observed manner was if the bolts that held the pylon to the wing had been removed and the engine/pylon assembly was being supported by something other than the aircraft itself. Hence investigators were able to conclude that the observed damage to the rear pylon mount <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>present</b> before the crash, rather than being caused by it.|$|E
5|$|Hess {{acquired}} full {{ownership of}} the Jets on February 9, 1984, when Helen Dillion sold her 25%interest to him. Before the season, New York traded quarterback Richard Todd to the New Orleans Saints. New York began its season with veteran Pat Ryan as starting quarterback; O'Brien was spending most weekdays waiting to testify about an altercation at the Studio 54 nightclub, at which Jets players <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>present</b> and, by some accounts, involved. The Jets had a second consecutive mediocre season, finishing 7–9 after starting the season 6–2.|$|E
5|$|In his article, Winter {{wondered}} why Coandă did not add the novel feature of fuel injection and air stream combustion to his May 1911 patent applications if that feature <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>present</b> during his supposed flying experience five months earlier. Rather, Winter {{noted that the}} August 1910 patent filings in French were {{essentially the same as}} the May 1911 ones in English, and that all the descriptions were applicable to air or water flowing through the device, meaning that the patents could not possibly include fuel combustion in the jet stream. He also noted that no mention was made in the early patents of asbestos or mica heat shields, or of any fuel injection or combustion.|$|E

5|$|It {{was placed}} on the Top Ten lists of several critics, with Roger Ebert giving it four stars, and listed it as 2005's eighth best film. The film {{received}} four Academy Award nominations, for Visual Effects, Sound Mixing (Christopher Boyes, Michael Semanick, Michael Hedges, Hammond Peek), Sound Editing, and Production Design, winning all but the last. Entertainment Weekly called the depiction of Kong the most convincing computer-generated character in film in 2005. Some criticized the film for retaining racist stereotypes that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>present</b> in the 1933 film, though it was not suggested that Jackson had done this intentionally.|$|E

In 1944 this was submitted to the United Nations War Crimes Commission, which had been set up by the Allies following the Moscow Declaration. Evidence about the crimes was presented to the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal on 2 January 1947, but no Japanese personnel were prosecuted for actions during the fighting at Milne Bay.|$|E
5|$|Sarah was {{completely}} oblivious to any friendship between Anne and Abigail, {{and was therefore}} surprised when she discovered that Abigail frequently saw the Queen in private. Sarah found out about Abigail's marriage several months after it had occurred, and immediately went to see Anne – {{with the intention of}} informing her of the event. It was at this interview that Anne let slip that she had begged Abigail to tell Sarah of the marriage; Sarah became suspicious about what had really happened. After questioning servants and Royal Household for a week about Abigail's marriage, Sarah discovered that Anne <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>present</b> and had given Abigail a dowry of £2000 from the Privy Purse. This proved Anne's duplicity to Sarah: as Keeper of the Privy Purse, Sarah had been unaware of any such payment.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Wisconsin Heights {{had been}} {{a victory for the}} militia; no regular {{soldiers}} of the U.S. Army <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>present.</b> Atkinson and the regulars joined up with the volunteers several days after the battle. With a force of about 400 regulars and 900 militiamen, the Americans crossed the Wisconsin River on July 27 and resumed the pursuit of the British Band. The British Band was moving slow, encumbered with wounded warriors and people dying of starvation. The Americans followed the trail of dead bodies, cast off equipment, and the remains of horses the hungry Natives had eaten.|$|E
5|$|The {{archbishop}} {{swore to}} Henry I {{that he would}} support Henry's daughter Matilda's claim to the English throne, but after Henry's death he instead crowned Stephen, on 22December 1135. He was persuaded {{to do so by}} Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester and Stephen's brother, and Roger of Salisbury, Bishop of Salisbury. The bishops argued that Henry had no right to impose the oath, and that the dying king had released the barons and the bishops from the oath in any event. The royal steward, Hugh Bigod, swore that he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>present</b> at the king's deathbed and had heard the king say that he released the oath.|$|E

5|$|A celebration {{broke out}} among the miners, who broke into liquor {{warehouses}} and saloons. That night, some of the miners loaded a flatcar with dynamite and attempted to roll it toward the deputies' camp. It overturned short of its goal and killed a cow. Other miners wanted to blow up every mine in the region, but Johnson quickly discouraged them. Frustrated, several drunken miners then stole a work train and steamed into Victor. They {{caught up with the}} group of fleeing deputies, and a gun battle broke out. One deputy and one miner died, a man on each side was wounded, and six strikers were captured by the deputies. The miners subsequently captured three officials of the Strong mine who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>present</b> when the shafthouse was blown up. A formal prisoner exchange later freed all prisoners on both sides.|$|E
5|$|After {{the border}} reopened, the British {{government}} reduced the {{military presence in}} Gibraltar by closing the naval dockyard. The RAF presence was also downgraded; although the airport officially remains an RAF base, military aircraft are no longer permanently stationed there. The British garrison, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>present</b> since 1704, was withdrawn in 1990 following defence cutbacks {{at the end of}} the Cold War. A number of military units continue to be stationed in Gibraltar under the auspices of British Forces Gibraltar; the garrison was replaced with locally recruited units of the Royal Gibraltar Regiment, while a Royal Navy presence is continued through the Gibraltar Squadron, responsible for overseeing the security of Gibraltar's territorial waters. In March 1988 a British military operation against members of the Provisional IRA (PIRA) planning a car bomb attack in Gibraltar ended in controversy when the Special Air Service shot and killed all three PIRA members.|$|E

5|$|Alice Nutter {{was unusual}} among the accused in being {{comparatively}} wealthy, {{the widow of}} a tenant yeoman farmer. She made no statement either before or during her trial, except to enter her {{plea of not guilty}} to the charge of murdering Henry Mitton by witchcraft. The prosecution alleged that she, together with Demdike and Elizabeth Device, had caused Mitton's death after he had refused to give Demdike a penny she had begged from him. The only evidence against Alice seems to have been that James Device claimed Demdike had told him of the murder, and Jennet Device in her statement said that Alice <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>present</b> at the Malkin Tower meeting. Alice may have called in on the meeting at Malkin Tower on her way to a secret (and illegal) Good Friday Catholic service, and refused to speak for fear of incriminating her fellow Catholics. Many of the Nutter family were Catholics, and two had been executed as Jesuit priests, John Nutter in 1584 and his brother Robert in 1600. Alice Nutter was found guilty.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{the design}} of the jersey was {{modified}} because the dye used to colour jerseys was needed for the war effort. This saw Eastern Suburbs playing in different colours and an altered design. Instead of using the traditional hoops, the side used a sky-blue based jersey and a red and white V-strip around the collar. This is the only noted time in the club's history where the traditional deep blue, red and white combination was absent from the jersey. After the war, the V-strip design reverted to the original blue that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>present</b> in the original jerseys, and the single red and white stripes around the shirt's chest were incorporated with a single white stripe surrounded by a red stripe on either side. This jersey appeared in the 1950s and remains the team's base design.|$|E
