5|$|Aqil's father, Musa Agha al-Hasi, {{himself a}} {{commander}} of Hawwara irregulars {{in the service}} of Acre's Ottoman governors, had left Egypt for Gaza in 1814.

5|$|Finally, {{the delegates}} {{turned to the}} vice presidency. Edmund Pettus, {{representing}} Alabama, moved the nomination of William Hayden English, a banker and former representative from Indiana.

He had been a Bayard enthusiast and was known as a successful businessman and hard money supporter; more crucially, he <b>hailed</b> <b>from</b> an important swing state. While Hendricks was a better-known representative of Indiana, Easterners in the party preferred English, who they saw as sounder on the money question. Several states seconded the nomination. John P. Irish of Iowa nominated former governor Richard M. Bishop of Ohio but, after all the other states expressed support for English, the Ohio delegation requested that Bishop's name be withdrawn and English's nomination made unanimous; the motion carried.|$|E
