5|$|Meanwhile, fuel {{flows through}} the main fuel valve into {{regenerative}} cooling systems for the nozzle and MCC, or through the chamber coolant valve. Fuel passing through the MCC cooling system then passes back through the LPFTP turbine before being routed either to the fuel tank pressurization system or to the hot gas manifold cooling system (<b>from</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> passes into the MCC). Fuel in the nozzle cooling and chamber coolant valve systems is then sent via pre-burners into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited again in the hot gas manifold, <b>from</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> passes into the MCC injectors. Once in the injectors, the propellants are mixed and injected into the main combustion chamber where they are ignited. The burning propellant mixture is then ejected through the throat and bell of the engine's nozzle, the pressure of which creates the thrust.|$|E

5|$|A crosstown line via Worth Street {{would serve}} as a branch of the IND Eighth Avenue Line's local tracks. The line would have {{branched}} off at Church Street, <b>from</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> would run via Worth Street and East Broadway to Lewis Street. This two-tracks segment would have cost $15,200,000. The line would then tunnel under the East River between Lewis Street to Driggs Avenue. This section would have cost $18,500,000. The South Fourth Street junction would be completed.|$|E
5|$|A more {{immediate}} {{need for a}} canal covering the section between Givors and Rive-de-Gier emerged in the 1750s, when a cheaper method than pack mules was needed to carry coal to heat houses in Lyon and to fuel the glass works that had been opened in Givors in 1749. In 1751, there were 1,200 mules engaged in carrying the coal from Rive-de-Gier to Givors, <b>from</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> was taken by water north to Lyon and south to the towns of the Midi. Lyon was consuming 36,000 tons annually. The coal sold for 5 francs a ton at the mine head and 21.70 francs per ton at the Lyon docks.|$|E
5|$|After briefly {{stopping}} in Albany, where its convoy was delayed due to {{concerns over the}} presence of German warships en route, the 10th Battalion departed Australian waters in November and proceeded towards Egypt.

Poor conditions and overcrowding in training camps in the United Kingdom resulted {{in the decision to}} disembark the Australians in Alexandria instead. Arriving there on 4 December 1914, the battalion was sent into camp at Mena, near Cairo.|$|E

The route crosses by ferry from Roscoff to Plymouth, and beyond Poole the path follows the Bournemouth Coast Path to Milford on Sea, then the Solent Way (with an Isle of Wight option), South Downs Way, 1066 Country Walk and Saxon Shore Way to Dover, <b>from</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> returns to {{continental}} Europe.

5|$|In 1827, at its peak, {{the canal}} {{transport}}ed 332,000 tons. The {{main purpose of}} the canal was still to transport coal to Givors, <b>from</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> could be taken to other towns on the river Rhone. On the return trip, boats carried some of the merchandise of the Midi including iron, oak wood and other things needed by the factories of the Loire department. By 1831, the population of Givors had risen to 9,210. There were many factories making window panes, bottles and glasses, and the port had a busy trade in coal shipment. Ten large glass works had been established at Rive-de-Gier that also transported their products by the canal.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, the New York State Legislature {{added two}} spur routes to Route30, an {{unsigned}} legislative route extending from Niagara Falls in western Niagara County to Rouses Point in Clinton County via Medina. The {{first of these}} began at Route30 (modern NY63) and followed what is now NY31E west to Middleport, <b>from</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> continued toward Lockport on current NY31. On March1, 1921, most of Route30's Medina–Lockport spur route was supplanted by an extended Route20. The lone exception was from Medina to Middleport, where Route20 utilized modern NY31 instead. When {{the first set of}} posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, all of legislative Route20 west of Rochester became part of NY3.|$|E

NY111 soon crosses the nearby Montauk Branch of the Long Island Rail Road just east of the Islip station, <b>from</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> continues north past various businesses and residences. As the road heads northward, it intersects with Bittermint Street, a connector to NY27 (Sunrise Highway) eastbound.

The signed and official routings join at the exit's northbound ramps. While concurrent with US9, NY149 passes the Adirondack/Lake George Factory Outlet Mall and several other businesses located {{on both sides of the}} highway. At the end of the factory outlets in the hamlet of French Mountain, NY149 turns off US9 and proceeds in a generally eastward direction toward the village of Fort Ann.|$|E
5|$|NY52 and NY216 largely swapped {{alignments}} in Spring1937 {{as part of}} {{a larger}} realignment of NY52 through Dutchess and Putnam counties. Route52 was relocated onto NY216 between Stormville and Ludingtonville, <b>from</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> followed a new roadway south to Lake Carmel. The former alignment of NY52 between Stormville and Towners became NY216, which was also extended eastward along NY164 to a new eastern terminus at NY22 east of Towners. The alignment of NY216 remained unaltered until January1, 1970, when Route216 was truncated to its current eastern terminus in Poughquag. As part of the truncation, NY216's former alignment from West Pawling to Patterson was renumbered to NY292 while the east–west roadway through Towners became NY164.|$|E
