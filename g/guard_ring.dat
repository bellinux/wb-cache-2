Thus, these designs have advantages for safe operation of the detectors at a high depletion voltage and for stability of readout chips.

One of the detector types had an n+ <b>guard</b> <b>ring</b> surrounding the diode, which was designed to minimise leakage current and limit the sensitive volume of the detector. This investigation showed that the <b>guard</b> <b>ring</b> was effective in minimising leakage current when grounded, but left unconnected greatly increased the overall detector noise and lead to a large decrease in collection efficiency. However, it was also seen that having the <b>guard</b> <b>ring</b> grounded acted as a pathway to ground for charge carriers created during incident radiation at low voltages, thus disqualifying it for use in passive mode.
