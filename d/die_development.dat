40|$|Abstract: This paper {{develops}} a general approach {{and a system}} tool for concurrent metal stamping part and <b>die</b> <b>development.</b> After analysis {{of the characteristics of}} the metal stamping development process and the interaction level among part design and die design activities, the needs for concurrent stamping part and die design are explored in depth, and an activity model for concurrent stamping part and <b>die</b> <b>development</b> is presented. A framework is proposed to support concurrent stamping part and <b>die</b> <b>development</b> by providing computer aided environments for part, process and die design, advisory tools for part stampability evaluation and part cost estimation, as well as process and die evaluation, and knowledge bases incorporated in the advisory tools. According to the framework, a design support strategy for concurrent stamping part and <b>die</b> <b>development</b> is investigated to guide the coordination of design activities including material selection, part stampability evaluation, process planning and die design, as well as cost estimation. Based on the proposed approach and strategy, the system prototype has been developed employing the knowledge-based approach. The results of this research will facilitate the rationalization of stamping part and <b>die</b> <b>development</b> and thus reduce the cost of metal stamping development...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{examine whether}} parental overprotection {{contributes}} to <b>die</b> <b>development</b> of functional somatic symptoms (FSS) in young adolescents. In addition, we aimed to study whether this potential effect of parental overprotection is mediated by parenting distress and/or moderated by the adolescent's sex. Study design FSS were measured in 2230 adolescents (ages 10 to 12 {{years from the}} Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey) by the Somatic Complaints subscale of the Youth Self Report at baseline and at follow-up 21 / 2 years later. Parental overprotection as perceived by the child was assessed {{by means of the}} EMBU-C (Swedish acronym for my memories of upbringing-child version). Parents completed the Parenting Stress Index. Linear regression analyses were performed adjusted for FSS at baseline and sex. Results Parental overprotection was a predictor of <b>die</b> <b>development</b> of FSS in young adolescents (beta = 0. 055, P <. 01). Stratified analyses revealed that maternal overprotection was a predictor of <b>die</b> <b>development</b> of FSS in girls (beta = 0. 085, P <. 02), whereas paternal overprotection was a predictor of the development of FSS in boys (beta = 0. 072, P <. 01). A small (5. 7 %) but significant mediating effect of maternal parenting stress in the relationship between parental overprotection and FSS was, found. Conclusions Parental overprotection {{may play a role in}} the development of FSS in young adolescents. (J Pediatr 2009; 154 : 918 - 23) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{introduces}} three auto {{body build}} concepts: net build (NB), functional build (FB) and integrated build (IB). Most manufacturers design and validate their vehicle launches using the NB concept. This concept {{is shown to}} be expensive, time consuming and not effective value added. Functional build has found growing acceptance as being preferable over NB. Functional build has tended to find the greatest acceptance as a die buyoff procedure for individual parts based on subassembly quality. Aspects of FB are shown in a case study where the manufacturer claimed to use FB for <b>die</b> <b>development,</b> but critical elements were omitted and opportunities lost. The integrated build (IB) process {{is an extension of}} the FB approach. It is a more inclusive process that considers the entire vehicle and requires closer coordination with product design.

40|$|Abstract. To reduce {{weight and}} {{increase}} fuel efficiency and safety, {{more and more}} automotive sheet stamping parts are being made of aluminum and high strength steels. Forming of such materials encounters not just reduced formability but also dimensional quality problems. Springback prediction accuracy and compensation effectiveness have been the major challenge to <b>die</b> <b>development,</b> construction and tryout. In this paper, the factors that affect the accuracy of springback prediction are discussed, which includes the effect of material models, the selection of element size, and the contact algorithms. Springback predictions of several automotive aluminum and high strength panels are compared with measurement data. The examples show that the prediction correlates with measurement data in both springback trend and magnitude. The effect of springback on final product can be reduced or eliminated through process control and die face compensation. The process control method involves finding {{the root causes of}} springback and eliminating them through process modification. The geometrical compensation of die surface is a direct way to eliminate the springback effect. The global scaling compensation method is normally limited to parts with relatively small springback. For large springback and twisting, a new approach is discussed, which takes into account of the effect of deformation and springback history. The compensation is achieved iteratively by solving a system of non-linear equations. Production dies were cut to the compensated surface, which shows that the die compensation is an efficient way to reduce springback-induced geometry deviation...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the effects of serotonin depletion on the progress and severity of adjuvant-induced arthritis in the Piebald-Viral-Glaxo (PVG) strain of rat. Total body depletion of serotonin was achieved using p-chlorophenylalanine given i. p. Two paradigms were investigated. First we depleted serotonin {{at the time of}} injection of the adjuvant to determine whether serotonin was involved in the initial induction phase. Secondly, we depleted serotonin at the time of onset of the inflammation. Serotonin levels in the hypothalamic para ventricular nucleus (PVN) were reduced by> 95 %. Depletion at the time of induction had no effect on the severity of the disease (determined by the increase in hind paw volume) 14 days after injection of the adjuvant. In contrast, depletion at the time of onset of the disease resulted in a significant reduction in severity at day 14, suggesting a pro-inflammatory role for serotonin in this model. The decrease in corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) mRNA in the PVN associated with <b>die</b> <b>development</b> of adjuvant arthritis in the PVG rat was reversed in the serotonin-depleted animals.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} {{the process of}} implementing a complex communications protocol that provides reliable delivery of data in multicast-capable, packet-switching telecommunication networks. Tile protocol, called the Reliable Multicasting Protocol (RMP), was developed incrementally {{using a combination of}} formal and informal techniques in an attempt to ensure the correctness of its implementation. Our development process involved three concun'ent activities: (1) the initial construction and incremental enhancement of a formal state model of the protocol machine; (2) tile initial coding and incren,,mtal enhancement of the implementation; and (3) m_:xlel-based testing of iterative implementations of the protocol. These activities were carried out by two separate teams: a design team and a V&V team. The design team built the first version of RMP with limited functionality to handle only nominal requirements of data delivery. In a series of iterative steps, the design team added new functionality to the implementation while the V&V team kept the state model in fidelity with the implementation. This was done by generating test cases based on suspected errant or off-nominal behaviors predicted by tile current model. If the execution of a test was different between the model and implementation, then the differences helped identify inconsistencies between the model and implementation. The dialogue between both teams drove tile co-evolution of the model and implementation. Testing served as the vehicle for keeping the model and implementation in fidelity with each other.

Females from Wolbachia-infected matrilines, however, {{give rise to}} all-female broods when infected and to all-male broods when cured of the infection. These observations had been interpreted as Wolbachia-induced feminization of genetic males into functional females. Here, we show that the interpretation is incorrect. Females from both lines have a female karyotype with a WZ sex-chromosome constitution while males are ZZ. At the time of hatching from eggs, WZ and ZZ individuals are present at a 1 : 1 ratio in broods from uninfected, infected and cured females. In broods from Wolbachia-infected females, ZZ individuals <b>die</b> during larval <b>development,</b> whereas in those from cured females, WZ individuals <b>die.</b> Hence, <b>development</b> of ZZ individuals is impaired by Wolbachia but development of WZ females may require the presence of Wolbachia in infected matrilines. Sexual mosaics generated (i) by transfection of uninfected eggs and (ii) by tetracycline treatment of Wolbachia-infected mothers prior to oviposition were ZZ in all tissues, including typically female organs. We conclude that: (i) Wolbachia acts by manipulating the sex determination of its host; and (ii) although sexual mosaics can survive, development of a normal female is incompatible with a ZZ genotype...|$|R
40|$|The {{underlying}} {{mechanisms that}} perpetuate liver inflammation in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis are poorly understood. We explored {{the hypothesis that}} cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) can exert pro-inflammatory effects in metabolic forms of fatty liver disease. Male wild-type (WT) C 57 BL 6 /N or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha knockout (PPAR-alpha(-/-)) mice were fed a lipogenic, methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet or the same diet with supplementary methionine and choline (control). COX- 2 was not expressed in livers of mice fed the control diet. In mice fed the MCD diet, hepatic expression of COX- 2 messenger RNA and protein occurred from day 5, continued to rise, and was 10 -fold higher than controls after 5 weeks, thereby paralleling <b>die</b> <b>development</b> of steatohepatitis. Upregulation of COX- 2 was even more pronounced in PPAR-alpha(-/-) mice. Induction of COX- 2 was completely prevented by dietary supplementation with the potent PPAR-alpha agonist Wy- 14, 643 in WT but not PPAR-alpha(-/-) mice. COX- 2 upregulation was preceded by activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) and coincided with increased levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL) - 6, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM- 1). Selective COX- 2 inhibitors (celecoxib and NS- 398) protected against the development of steatohepatitis in WT but not PPAR-alpha(-/-) mice. In conclusion, induction of COX- 2 occurs in association with NF-kappa B activation and upregulation of TNF-alpha, IL- 6, and ICAM- 1 in MCD diet-induced steatohepatitis. PPAR-alpha suppresses both COX- 2 and development of steatohepatitis, while pharmacological inhibition of COX- 2 activity ameliorates the severity of experimental steatohepatitis. COX- 2 may therefore be a pro-inflammatory mediator in metabolic forms of steatohepatitis...|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{technological}} development has flooded modern-day society with change and innovation. Virtual Reality, {{one of these}} technologies, is modifying conventional ideas of not only entertainment and communication, but also questions the concept of reality. The roots of the underlying concepts of Virtual Reality {{can be traced back}} to the past. Metaphysically, hermeneutically and anthropologically these traces indicate why Virtual Reality is more than just the mere simulation of reality and why this technology has such an immersive influence on society. This influence is also prevalent in theology, wherein virtuality is more than just a metaphor for understanding theology and expressing faith. This study explores the value of virtuality for theology by investigating Dietrich Bonhoeffer s doctoral dissertation Sanctorum Communio of 1927. Three tenets of virtuality, being actualisation, time-space irrelevancy and collectivity are elaborated on with the aim of providing a new reading of Sanctorum Communio. Deleuzian philosophy and the technology of hypertext are indicated as two main moments in <b>die</b> <b>development</b> of actuality. This study supports Gilles Deleuze s position that virtual reality is about the reality of the virtual which causes space and time to become irrelevant, however, based on a modernistic epistemology this notion can lead to individualism and disruption. The value of actualisation is found in community as depicted in collective intelligence and reciprocity, offering a new postfoundationalist epistemology for understanding virtuality and reality. Bonhoeffer s Sanctorum Communio is thus approached via the hermeneutical key of virtuality. By investigating the sociality of the church, Bonhoeffer arrives at a Christo-ecclesiology of the church as being Christus als Gemeinde existierend. This presents a church for all space and all time, but just as community is the key to unlocking the value of virtuality, it similarly is the key to unlocking the value of the actualisation of Christ in church. This is realised through the reciprocal community of the sanctorum communio. By re-reading Bonhoeffer through the hermeneutic of virtuality, a new understanding of reality and of church is formulated.

We characterized the VDR gene polymorphism in a healthy adult Brazilian population and {{in a group of}} patients with IDDM and correlated these findings with densitometric values in both groups. the Brazilian population is characterized by an important racial heterogeneity and therefore is considered an ethnically heterogeneous population. We recruited 94 healthy adult Brazilian volunteers (63 women and 31 men), mean (+/- SD) age 32. 4 +/- 6. 5 years (range 18 - 39 years), and 78 patients with IDDM (33 women and 45 men) diagnosed before 18 years of age, mean (+/- SD) age 23. 3 +/- 5. 5 years (range 18 - 39 years). VDR genotype was assessed by polymerase chain reaction amplification followed by BsmI digestion on DNA isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes. Statistical analysis included Bonferroni t-test to compare densitometric values within different genotypes in bath groups and multiple regression analysis of bone density adjusted for potential confounding factors. the IDDM group had a lower BMD compared with the control group. the VDR genotype distribution in the control group was 43 Bb (45. 7 %), 39 bb (41. 5 %) and 12 BB (12. 8 %). This distribution did not differ from that observed in the IDDM group: 39 Bb (50 %), 26 bb (33. 3 %) and 13 BB (16. 7 %). in the IDDM group, patients with the Bb genotype had a higher body weight when compared with the BB genotype (p = 0. 02). However, when diabetic patients were controlled for age, sea and body mass index, BB genotype was associated with a lower mean BMD at lumbar spine and femoral neck than in Bb and bb patients. BE patients had a shorter duration of IDDM than bb and Bb patients. These findings suggest a small influence of VDR gene polymorphism on BRID of a racially heterogeneous population with IDDM.
