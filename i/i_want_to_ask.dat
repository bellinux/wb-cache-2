25|$|<b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> {{for your}} {{forgiveness}}, {{that many of}} our dreams didn't come true. That what seemed to us to be simple turned out painfully difficult. I ask forgiveness for the fact that I didn't justify some of the hopes of those people who believed that with one stroke, one burst, one sign we could jump from the grey, stagnant, totalitarian past to a bright, rich, civilized future.

One burst was not enough... but I want you to know – I've never said this, today it's important for me to tell you: the pain of every one of you, I feel in myself, in my heart... in saying farewell, I want to say to every one of you: be happy. You deserve happiness. You deserve happiness, and peace.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh! You think so? When I saw you I didn't {{know why}} you were here. I was glad when you spoke to me because {{this is exactly what}} <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you for. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you if you ever meet Captain Anthony--by any chance--anywhere--you are a sailor too, are you not?--that you, would never mention--never--that--that you had seen me over there." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'I--er--no, thank you. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you a question. What is your candid {{opinion of}} those verses Mr Wells was reading just now?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah! <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for Captain Houghton,' said Alice, glad to {{lead the}} {{conversation}} away from revelations of which she had an instinctive dread.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Jenney said {{something}} else that--that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you about," [...] she went on, breathing more deeply. [...] "It {{was about the}} railroad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I'm {{going down}} home pretty early, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> your mother {{what is the}} best way to put away my winter things." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{am a man}} again," [...] Julian declared. [...] "Come along {{round to}} Westminster. There are many things <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> about the Executive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{been here}} {{two or three}} days. Well, it's a bit of luck {{catching}} you. You see, what <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> your advice about...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I doubted if my step-father {{would bring}} me, but I really meant to come," [...] she said. [...] "For one thing, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you--" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Is she gone?' said Mr. Kendal, who {{had been}} musing after his last words. 'Gone to tell her friend, <b>I</b> suppose? <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> what this scene was.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Professor {{spoke up}} like a man," [...] she agreed, [...] "but, Laura, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you something. Did you notice his servant--that man Craig?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{answered}} {{your question}} just now," [...] said the girl, very quietly, [...] "because <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you one. Do you believe my uncle’s {{story about the}} buried treasure?" ...|$|R
