5|$|Lapensée was {{reputed to}} have scored over 150 goals {{and led her}} team to be unbeaten {{throughout}} 1916 and 1917, when records indicate that they won 45 of their 46 games. However, after demanding {{a share of the}} profits from the games, Lapensée disappeared from the sport in 1918, still aged under 20. There were a number of rumours: that she had died in the 1918 flu pandemic, that she had travelled to New York to undergo a sex-change, or that she had always been a draft <b>dodging</b> man, though none provided any credible evidence. A 1940 profile of her father refuted all those claims, detailing her as living as a woman in New York.|$|E

5|$|When combat is initiated, a {{separate}} screen shows the battle play out: attack power {{is based on}} the strength of weapons and their units, while damage is calculated based on both the type of attack used and the opposing unit's physical and magical defense. Critical hits triple the damage of normal attacks. Each battle awards experience points, which raise a unit's experience level: their level and statistics cap at 20. When a character changes class, their experience level returns to 1 while their stats increase slightly. Unit abilities can be influenced through a Support system: when two characters have a story-based relationship such as being lovers of friends, they boost stats such as attack power or <b>dodging</b> ability.|$|E
5|$|While games such as Street Fighter and Tekken require {{players to}} {{memorize}} relatively lengthy and complicated button-input combinations often specific {{to only a}} particular character, Super Smash Bros. uses the same control combinations to access all moves for all characters. Characters are additionally not limited to only facing opponents, instead being allowed to run around freely on the stage. The game focuses more on aerial and platforming skills than other fighting games, with relatively larger, more-dynamic stages rather than a simple flat platform. Smash Bros. also implements blocking and <b>dodging</b> mechanics. Grabbing and throwing other characters is also possible.|$|E
5|$|During {{spare time}} in filming, Tom Baker and Ian Marter (who played Harry Sullivan {{in the series}} and later novelised several Doctor Who scripts for Target Books) wrote a script for a Doctor Who film, Doctor Who meets Scratchman. The script, {{sometimes}} titled Doctor Who and the Big Game, saw the Doctor encounter the Daleks, meet the Devil known as Harry Scratch or Scratchman, robots known as Cybors, scarecrows made from bones, the Greek god Pan, and at times Vincent Price and Twiggy {{were associated with the}} production to play as the villain Harry Scratch and a possible new female companion after Elisabeth Sladen left the TV series. The finale of the film was to have taken place on a giant pinball table, with the Doctor, Harry and Sarah <b>dodging</b> balls as well as battling Daleks on the board. During his tenure as the Fourth Doctor, Baker repeatedly tried to attract funding for the film. At one point, he received substantial donations from fans, but after taking legal advice was forced to return them. The plans were eventually dropped.|$|E

5|$|Jet Force Gemini is a third-person shooter with shoot 'em up and action-adventure elements, {{in which}} the player {{controls}} the player character from a third-person perspective in a 3D environment. The game places strong emphasis on shooting large numbers of enemies while <b>dodging</b> their attacks. Weapons have no magazines restrictions and range from grenades to a pistol, a machine gun, a sniper rifle, a flamethrower, and rocket launchers, among others. Although much {{of the game is}} spent in battle, the player has the ability to jump, hang from most ledges, swim and fly using jet packs when needed. In combat, the player is free to set on a manual aiming system with the targeting camera fixed behind the character's head. When using this technique, a crosshair appears on screen and the player character becomes translucent so that players can aim and shoot with finesse. By contrast, when walking around, the game plays similar to a 3D platformer.|$|E
5|$|Malini is an indigent {{woman whose}} father is in poor health. She is persuaded by her friend Sundari, an actress, {{to join her}} theatre company, Kala Mandhiram. Malini soon becomes very {{successful}} and popular. She is later befriended by Sampath, a charlatan, who is regularly involved in <b>dodging</b> creditors. Deaf to all advice, Malini allows herself to be led astray in professional, financial and moral terms.

She also severs ties with those who previously helped her, including Sundari.

Sampath abandons Malini, who falls back to her previous poor condition. However, with Sundari's help, she returns to Kala Mandhiram and begins her life anew.|$|E
5|$|McPherson's corps was {{assigned}} to attack the center along the Jackson Road. On their right flank, the brigade of Brig. Gen. Thomas E. G.

Logan {{was assigned}} to assault the 3rd Louisiana Redan and the Great Redoubt. The brigade of Brig. Gen. John E. Smith made {{it as far as}} the slope of the redan, but huddled there, <b>dodging</b> grenades until dark before they were recalled. Brig. Gen. John D. Stevenson's brigade advanced well in two columns against the redoubt, but their attack also failed when they found their ladders were too short to scale the fortification. Brig. Gen. Isaac F. Quinby's division advanced a few hundred yards, but halted for hours while its generals engaged in confused discussions.|$|E
