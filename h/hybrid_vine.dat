50|$|Zarya severa (Northern Lights) {{is a red}} grape variety. It is a {{descendant}} of the Asiatic wild grape Vitis amurensis and the grape Malingre Précoce and is thus a <b>hybrid</b> <b>vine.</b> The crossing {{took place at the}} Potapenko Viticulture Research Institute in Rostov Oblast, Russia in 1936. Because of its high winter frost resistance as well as its resistance to downy mildew, this variety, often mentioned by breeders in Eastern Europe, became a major breeding stock in the search for new varieties.|$|E
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th Century, {{hybridization}} {{became a}} popular avenue of research for stopping the phylloxera louse. Hybridization is the breeding of Vitis vinifera with resistant species. Most native American grapes are naturally phylloxera resistant (Vitis aestivalis, rupestris, and riparia are particularly so, while Vitis labrusca has a somewhat weak resistance to it) but have aromas that are off-putting to palates accustomed to European grapes. The intent of the cross was to generate a <b>hybrid</b> <b>vine</b> that was resistant to phylloxera but produced wine that did not taste like the American grape. Ironically, the hybrids tend not to be especially resistant to phylloxera, although they are much more hardy with respect to climate and other vine diseases. The new hybrid varieties have never gained the popularity of the traditional ones. In the EU they are generally banned or at least strongly discouraged from use in quality wine, although they are still in widespread use in much of North America, such as Missouri, Ontario, and upstate New York.|$|E
40|$|Currently, <b>hybrid</b> <b>vine</b> cultivars are not {{significantly}} used for wine making in Europe due to technological and legal reasons, nor as table grapes. VITENERGY 1 {{is a project}} finalized to the evaluation and selection of grapevine hybrid cultivars suitable for production of biomasses destined {{to the production of}} bioenergies (e. g., bioethanol, cellulose). Anthocyanins, flavonoids, flavonols and seed oil triglyceride composition of 34 grape cultivars collected from the CRA-VIT vine germplasm collection were characterized to evaluate their production of by-products useful for the food, nutraceutical and pharmaceutical industry. ‘Seibel 8357 ’, ‘Burdin 4077 ’ and ‘Bacò 30 - 12 ’ grape had very high total anthocyanins content (between 3 - 5 g/kg) and total flavonoids (5 - 6 g/kg grape). ‘Seibel 19881 ’, ‘Siebel 8745 ’ and ‘Seyve Villard 12 - 347 ’ had total flavonol contents between 100 - 200 mg/kg; ‘Bacò 1 ’ showed high percentage of unsaturated triacylglycerols, and ‘Seibel 10878 ’ high seed oil production. The considerable commercial value of these bioactive compounds can {{play an important role in}} the economic sustainability of a vineyard dedicated also to production of biomass for energy use...|$|E
50|$|While rare, {{interspecific}} <b>hybrid</b> <b>vines</b> {{can result}} in the wild from cross-pollination. Due to the abundance of American Vitis species one finds such natural <b>hybrid</b> <b>vines</b> on the American continent. The majority of the well-known <b>hybrid</b> <b>vines</b> however, have been artificially created. The earliest named hybrid in America was the Alexander grape, discovered around 1740 near a vineyard planted for William Penn along the Schuylkill.|$|R
50|$|Nova Scotia's {{primary focus}} on grape growing for wine {{production}} had been <b>hybrid</b> <b>vines,</b> {{due to their}} cold hardy and disease-resistant nature. In recent years, Nova Scotia's wineries attempted to grow vinifera in significant amounts, to moderate success.|$|R
50|$|While {{better quality}} wines (vinho fino) are {{produced}} from the European grapevine Vitis vinifera, in 2003 only some 5000 ha out of Brazil's 68000 ha were planted with such vines. The rest are American <b>vines</b> or <b>hybrid</b> <b>vines,</b> {{many of which}} are easier to cultivate under Brazilian growing conditions.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{evaluate}} the sustainability, in terms of greenhouse gases emission saving, of a new potential bio-ethanol production chain {{in comparison with the}} most common ones. The innovation consists of producing bio-ethanol from different types of no-food grapes, while usually bio-ethanol is obtained from matrices taken away from crop for food destination: sugar cane, corn, wheat, sugar beet. In the past, breeding programs were conducted with the aim of improving grapevine characteristics, a large number of <b>hybrid</b> <b>vine</b> varieties were produced and are nowadays present in the CRA-VIT (Viticulture Research Centre) Germplasm Collection. Some of them are potentially interesting for bio-energy production because of their high production of sugar, good resistance to diseases, and ability to grow in marginal lands. LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) of grape ethanol energy chain was performed following two different methods: (i) using the spreadsheet “BioGrace, developed within the “Intelligent Energy Europe” program to support and to ease the RED (Directive 2009 / 28 /EC) implementation; (ii) using a dedicated LCA software. Emissions were expressed in CO 2 equivalent (CO 2 eq). The results showed that the sustainability limits provided by the normative are respected to this day. On the contrary, from 2017 this production will be sustainable only if the transformation processes will be performed using renewable sources of energy. The comparison with other bioenergy chains points out that the production of ethanol using grapes represents an intermediate situation in terms of general emissions among the different production chains...|$|E
50|$|Phylloxera is an American root aphid that devastated V. vinifera {{vineyards}} in Europe when accidentally {{introduced in}} the late 19th century. Attempts were made to breed in resistance from American species, but many winemakers didnt like the unusual flavour profile of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>vines.</b> Fortunately, V. vinifera grafts readily onto rootstocks of the American species, and most commercial production of grapes now relies on such grafts.|$|R
5000|$|Hybrid {{varieties}} {{exhibit a}} mix of traits from their European, Asiatic, and North American parentage. Those varieties which derive from Vitis labrusca parentage (such as those still used {{in the production of}} Austrian Uhudler) have a strong [...] "candied" [...] or [...] "wild strawberry" [...] aroma, while those that derive from Vitis riparia often have a herbaceous nose with flavours reminiscent of black currants. Most hybrid grape varieties struggle to produce adequate tannin for red wine production, and usually display a level of acidity that exceeds what consumers of wines produced from vitis vinifera are accustomed to. These attributes proved unpopular in Europe, and were among the factors that led to the prohibition of the commercial growth of <b>hybrid</b> <b>vines</b> in many countries in Europe.|$|R
40|$|Xylella fastidiosa (Xf) is the causative {{agent of}} Pierce’s disease of grape. Xf {{genetics}} {{has not been}} evaluated in Texas despite growing financial risk to the US grape industry, a Texas population of the insect vector now spreading in California, and evidence that the bacterium is ubiquitous to southern states. Using sequences of conserved gyrB and mopB genes, we have established at least two strains in Texas, grape strain and ragweed strain, corresponding genetically with subspecies piercei and multiplex, respectively. The grape strain in Texas is found in Vitis vinifera varieties, <b>hybrid</b> <b>vines</b> and in wild Vitis near vineyards; whereas, the ragweed strain in Texas is found in annuals, shrubs and trees near vineyards or other areas. RFLP and QRT PCR techniques were used to differentiate grape and ragweed strains with greater efficiency than sequencing and are practical for screening numerous Xf isolates for clade identity...|$|R
50|$|Black rot is {{probably}} the “Achilles heel” for organic grape production in the East. In the only good trial that we’ve run with copper, it provided 40% disease control when applied at 2-week intervals, versus essentially 100% control with Nova. To try to avoid this, implement a rigorous program to remove mummies during pruning, and spray copper once a week {{throughout much of the}} growing season. This was hard on some of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>vines</b> and runs counter to the thinking of many with a “sustainable” orientation (after all, copper is an element and doesn’t break down into anything else, so it stays in the soil forever), but it did control the disease in an organically acceptable manner. Limit inoculum within the vineyard. Ideally, this would include removing or burying any mummies that you might encounter at the site. All mummified clusters should be removed from the trellis during pruning and from 2 to 6 weeks after cap fall and prune out any affected clusters before they allow the disease to spread, all the better (spores for disease spread are dispersed by rain primarily within the canopy, so should pose little risk of causing new infections if said clusters are simply dropped to the ground).|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of genes that confer resistance to major grapevine pests and pathogens into the highly susceptible V. vinifera cultivars used for wine production worldwide {{would be of}} signifi cant economic and environmental benefi t. The availability of genetic resources for grapevine {{has led to a}} dramatic increase in research on the mapping of resistance loci. Often the outcome of this work is the development of markers for marker-assisted selection of new disease-resistant interspecific hybrids. However, positional cloning of these resistance genes offers the possibility to introduce these genes into existing elite wine grape cultivars by grapevine transformation without affecting wine quality which has been a major obstacle in the adoption of <b>hybrid</b> <b>vines</b> generated by classical breeding. Furthermore positional cloning offers the possibility to introduce resistance genes into V. vinifera cultivars from species which cannot be achieved through hybridization. Finally, cloning of resistance genes provides sequence information {{that can be used to}} design perfect genetic markers which will maximize the effi ciency of marker assisted selection approaches. This chapter describes the strategy used, and technical challenges encountered, during the mapping and positional cloning of powdery mildew and downy mildew resistance genes from the wild North American grape species Muscadinia rotundifolia...|$|R
50|$|The Rias Baixas is {{the most}} well known region of Galicia and {{produces}} some of Spain's most sought after dry white wines based on the Albariño grape. While wines have been produced in this region for some time, exports of the wine {{to other areas of}} Europe didn't begin till 16th century and was kept at a steady pace till the phylloxera epidemic devastated the region's vineyards. At the turn of the 20th century many of the region's vineyards were replanted with low quality <b>hybrid</b> <b>vines</b> and some plantings of the Sherry grape Palomino that didn't produce as well in the cooler climate of Rías Baixas. In the 1970s growers began to replant native varieties like Albariño. Throughout the region 12 grape varieties are permitted, including the red wine grapes of Mencia and Espadeiro, but Albariño accounts for 90% of the region's production. The vineyard soils of the area are granite based and ideally situated for the damp maritime climate of the area. Despite the reputation for high yields in other parts of Galicia, Rías Baixas keeps the yield of its Albariño plantings low in order to produce concentrated fruity and fragrant wine. The wines are often a minimum alcohol content of 12% and are rarely produced in a style other than dry.|$|R
50|$|Like {{many other}} plants, grape vines are {{susceptible}} to chlorosis, and symptoms of iron deficiency tend to be common on soils rich in limestone. In the wake of The Great French Wine Blight, when European Vitis vinifera were affected by Phylloxera, chlorosis became a greater problem in viticulture. To deal with the Phylloxera blight, V. vinifera was grafted onto rootstock based on American species of the Vitis genus, such as Vitis riparia, Vitis rupestris, Vitis berlandieri. However, many of these were less adapted to the lime-rich soils that were common in France's vineyards, in particular many of those that produced wines of top quality. Many grafted vines in lime-rich vineyards therefore showed signs of iron deficiency, and in France this specific form of chlorosis was termed chlorose calcaire. The problem was largely overcome by the selection of lime-resistant American vines as basis for <b>hybrid</b> <b>vines</b> used for rootstock material. However, since such rootstocks may be less than optimal in other respects, {{it is necessary for}} the viticulturalist to balance the need for chlorosis resistance against other viticultural needs. This is illustrated by {{one of the most common}} lime-resistant rootstocks, 41 B, which is a hybrid between V. vinifera cultivar Chasselas and V. berlandieri, which generally has a sufficient, but not extremely high, Phylloxera resistance.|$|R
40|$|Noiret' is a mid-season {{red wine}} grape {{suitable}} {{for the production of}} varietal wines. The distinctive red wine is rickly colored and has notes of green and black pepper along with raspberry, blackberry, and some mint aromas. A major distinguishing characteristic of this selection is the fine tannin structure that is complete {{from the front of the}} mouth to the back. The tannin structure and the absence of any hybrid aromas strongly distinguish this selection from other red <b>hybrid</b> grapes.

25|$|In the mid-1970s, several growers began {{experimenting with}} plantings of Vitis vinifera. The Osoyoos Indian band {{established}} {{the first commercial}} vineyard dedicated to vinifera varieties with plantings of Riesling, Ehrenfelser and Scheurebe. In 1976, notable German viticulturalist and grape breeder Helmut Becker visited the Okanagan and encouraged more growers to consider planting German grape varieties and provided clones of Pinot blanc, Pinot gris and Gewürtztraminer that were developed at the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute and bred to withstand the cold, winter temperatures of the Okanagan. Further impetus for the planting of vinifera came in the late 1980s when Canada entered into the North American Free Trade Agreement that opened up the Canadian markets to American wines from California, Oregon and Washington.

40|$|A mass spectrometric-based {{procedure}} for anthocyanin profiling {{was set up}} to distinguish authentic Vitis vinifera from hybrid red grapevine cultivars. 3 -O-Monoglucoside and the related acetyl-, p-coumaryland caffeoyl-monoglucoside anthocyanins occurred only in Vitis vinifera, whereas 3, 5 -O-diglucoside and the substituted acetyl-, p-coumaryl-, feruloyl- and caffeoyl-diglucoside anthocyanins were the additional pigments in hybrid grapevines. The procedure was applied expressly to identify red grape cultivars based on the anthocyanin chemo-type determination. In particular, a red grape cultivar, having 3, 5 -O-diglucoside anthocyanins and a novel class of anthocyanin monoglucosides, such as cyanidin- 3 -O-, cyanidin- 3 -O-(6 -O-acetyl) - and cyanidin- 3 -O-(6 -O-p-coumaryl) pentoside, was classified as <b>hybrid.</b> A second <b>vine</b> cultivar, characterized exclusively by 3 -O-monoglucoside anthocyanins, was included among the Vitis vinifera species.
