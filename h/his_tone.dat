5|$|Smith {{replied that}} in his {{interpretation}} Rhodesia was required to keep Whitehall informed, but prior British concurrence was not necessary; if Britain contested this, the Prime Minister said, then surely the 1957 entrustment had never meant anything. Dupont then spoke again, rejecting {{the idea that the}} Rhodesian mission should be a mere subsidiary consulate of the British Embassy. Hughes replied firmly that the 1957 despatch did not give the Rhodesians free rein over external matters, and warned them to be more flexible if they intended to find common ground. Eager to avoid open confrontation, Smith told Dupont to reconsider <b>his</b> <b>tone,</b> and changed the subject.|$|E
25|$|Rachmaninoff {{composed}} the concerto in the peaceful setting of his family's country estate, Ivanovka, completing it on September 23, 1909. Contemporary with this work are his First Piano Sonata and <b>his</b> <b>tone</b> poem The Isle of the Dead.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Woodward {{asked the}} {{question}} sneeringly, but there was much of curiosity in <b>his</b> <b>tones.</b>|$|R
60|$|The lad spoke fairly, although, as I fancied, {{with too}} much of boldness, and just a spice of anger in <b>his</b> <b>tones.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Beggin' your pardin', sir," [...] {{said one}} of them with more politeness in <b>his</b> <b>tones</b> {{than he had ever}} used before, [...] "but------" ...|$|R
25|$|Commerford is very secretive of <b>his</b> <b>tone,</b> {{even going}} so far as to put effects on his pedalboard that he doesn't even use, making his own gear, and even {{removing}} the labels off some of his effects. Here are some effects which he has used during his career.|$|E
25|$|From {{the point}} of view of style, the poet's work is marked by his simplicity, distant from the grandiloquence and the {{metrical}} structure of the neoclassic poets. His verses approach the popular forms, and <b>his</b> <b>tone</b> approaches a colloquialism, which contributes to the effect of denunciation of everyday vices, of ordinary episodes.|$|E
25|$|With <b>his</b> <b>tone</b> poems Amazonas (1917, first {{performed}} in Paris in 1929) and Uirapurú (1917, first performed 1935) he created works dominated by indigenous Brazilian influences. The works use Brazilian folk tales and characters, imitations {{of the sounds}} of the jungle and its fauna, imitations of the sound of the nose-flute by the violinophone, and not least imitations of the uirapuru itself.|$|E
6000|$|... [Before 115] Ordonio (checking {{the feeling}} of surprise, and forcing <b>his</b> <b>tones</b> into an {{expression}} of playful courtesy). Editions 1, 2, 3, 1829.|$|R
60|$|Mary's {{answer to}} this, as <b>his</b> <b>tones</b> became incautiously emphatic, was a glance round all the attic doors, lest {{they should have}} ears.|$|R
60|$|<b>His</b> <b>tones</b> were so fearful, {{and he put}} so much {{emphasis}} on the last sentence, that the watchman burst hurriedly out of the galley.|$|R
25|$|In 1826, {{when the}} Sultan issued a decree abolishing the janissaries in Bosnia, Gradaščević's {{immediate}} reaction was {{not unlike that}} {{of the rest of}} the Bosnian aristocracy. Gradaščević threatened that he would use military force to subdue anybody opposed to the Sarajevo janissaries. When the janissaries killed nakibul-ešraf Nuruddin Efendi Šerifović, however, <b>his</b> <b>tone</b> shifted and he rapidly distanced himself from their cause.|$|E
25|$|Zerachia Halevi {{influenced}} greatly {{the following}} generations of rabbis and scholars, {{and some of}} them wrote responsa in his defense, among them Nahmanides, who previously had been his irreconcilable critic. Even Ravad, who outlived his friend and rival by 13 years, softened <b>his</b> <b>tone</b> after Zerachiah's death and wrote about him with great respect, criticizing him only on the substance of issues under consideration.|$|E
25|$|Parker was {{a highly}} {{influential}} jazz soloist and a leading figure {{in the development of}} bebop, a form of jazz characterized by fast tempos, virtuosic technique and advanced harmonies. Parker was a blazingly fast virtuoso, and he introduced revolutionary harmonic ideas including rapid passing chords, new variants of altered chords, and chord substitutions. <b>His</b> <b>tone</b> ranged from clean and penetrating to sweet and somber.|$|E
60|$|The speaker {{tried to}} {{disguise}} <b>his</b> <b>tones,</b> {{but the voice}} sounded much like that of Lew Flapp and instantly Dick was on the alert.|$|R
60|$|He said {{it through}} his teeth with such a {{concentration}} of rage in <b>his</b> <b>tones</b> that {{it was easy to}} guess where the sore rankled.|$|R
60|$|Thuvan Dihn turned upon Kulan Tith. Rage flamed in his keen eyes; {{but by the}} masterfulness of his {{self-control}} he kept <b>his</b> <b>tones</b> {{level as}} he spoke.|$|R
25|$|In the sonnet, {{the speaker}} {{declares}} his admiration {{and love for}} the beauty of youth, but warns this figure of youth that he will lose it if he doesn't revitalize himself through offspring. The primary arguments made in this procreation sonnet are the maintenance of self-identity and duty to one's own heritage. <b>His</b> <b>tone</b> throughout the sonnet is intimate, highlighting the theme of affection for youth that is prevalent in the first seventeen sonnets.|$|E
25|$|As Wilson {{departed}} Key West, {{he made an}} off-hand {{remark that}} he believed the WSB recommendations would seriously destabilize the economy. Murray was outraged by the statement, and declared that it was Wilson who had wrecked national economic stabilization policy. Although Murray said he remained committed to resuming bargaining on March 26, he refused to meet with Wilson. Murray, working with Goldberg, had initially prepared a much stronger statement, but Feinsinger successfully pleaded with him to moderate <b>his</b> <b>tone</b> and language.|$|E
25|$|On March 5, 1990, Atwater {{suffered}} a seizure during a fundraising breakfast for Senator Phil Gramm. Doctors discovered a grade 3 astrocytoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer, {{in his right}} parietal lobe. He underwent interstitial implant radiation – then a new treatment – at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, followed by conventional radiation therapy at George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.C. The treatment left him paralyzed on his left side, robbed him of <b>his</b> <b>tone</b> discrimination, and swelled his face and body.|$|E
60|$|Her husband {{kept his}} place, {{and spoke to}} her as she stopped {{opposite}} to me. <b>His</b> <b>tones</b> were altered, but his manner showed as little feeling as ever.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The novice,' pursued Mr Tappertit, {{not exactly}} {{in a voice}} of thunder, for <b>his</b> <b>tones,</b> to say the truth were rather cracked and shrill--but very impressively, notwithstanding--'where is he?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{want you}} to go away," [...] said Josiah Crabtree, and there was just a trace of {{nervousness}} in <b>his</b> <b>tones.</b> Evidently Dick's firm words had had some effect.|$|R
25|$|He stopped {{composing}} {{during his}} time in Berlin, resuming only in 1841 with a move to Vienna and marriage to Mathilde Scherer. In 1842 a concert of <b>his</b> <b>tone</b> poems at the Redoutensaal at the Hofburg Imperial Palace received extremely positive reviews, and {{over the course of}} the next three years Berwald wrote four symphonies. These were not the first symphonies he wrote. Numerous major works from the 1820s have gone missing, and the torso of a Symphony in A's first movement remains, has been finished, and recorded.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 1940s, Copland {{became aware that}} Stravinsky and other fellow {{composer}}s had begun to study Arnold Schoenberg's use of twelve-tone (serial) techniques. After he {{had been exposed to}} the works of French composer Pierre Boulez, he incorporated serial techniques into his Piano Quartet (1950), Piano Fantasy (1957), Connotations for orchestra (1961) and Inscape for orchestra (1967). Unlike Schoenberg, Copland used <b>his</b> <b>tone</b> rows in much the same fashion as his tonal material—as sources for melodies and harmonies, rather than as complete statements in their own right, except for crucial events from a structural point of view. From the 1960s onward, Copland's activities turned more from composing to conducting. He became a frequent guest conductor of orchestras in the U.S. and the UK and made a series of recordings of his music, primarily for Columbia Records.|$|E
25|$|Strauss's next opera was Elektra (1909), {{which took}} {{his use of}} dissonance even further, in {{particular}} with the Elektra chord. Elektra {{was also the first}} opera in which Strauss collaborated with the poet Hugo von Hofmannsthal. The two subsequently worked together on numerous occasions. For his later works with Hofmannsthal, Strauss moderated his harmonic language: he used a more lush, melodic late-Romantic style based on Wagnerian chromatic harmonies that he had used in <b>his</b> <b>tone</b> poems, with much less dissonance, and exhibiting immense virtuosity in orchestral writing and tone color. This resulted in operas such as Der Rosenkavalier (1911) having great public success. Strauss continued to produce operas at regular intervals until 1942. With Hofmannsthal he created Ariadne auf Naxos (1912), Die Frau ohne Schatten (1919), Die ägyptische Helena (1928), and Arabella (1933). For Intermezzo (1924) Strauss provided his own libretto. Die schweigsame Frau (1935), was composed with Stefan Zweig as librettist; Friedenstag (1935–6) and Daphne (1937) both had a libretto by Joseph Gregor and Stefan Zweig; and Die Liebe der Danae (1940) was with Joseph Gregor. Strauss's final opera, Capriccio (1942), had a libretto by Clemens Krauss, although the genesis for it came from Stefan Zweig and Joseph Gregor.|$|E
60|$|There was a hypocritical flavour of courtliness {{about his}} words, and a mincing of <b>his</b> <b>tones</b> that {{suggested}} {{the efforts of}} a bull-calf to imitate the warbling of a throstle.|$|R
50|$|Sulekha who {{reviewed}} the music {{said that the}} title track ‘Maha Maha’ is the top pick. Cinesnacks said that {{the words in the}} songs, sound perfectly ‘clear cut’ in <b>his</b> <b>tones.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'When {{you were}} with Hewby, of course, of course. Well, I can't {{understand}} it.' <b>His</b> <b>tones</b> rose. 'I don't know what to say, your hoodwinking me like this for so long!' ...|$|R
500|$|Szigeti's {{performing}} {{technique was}} not always flawless and <b>his</b> <b>tone</b> lacked sensuous beauty, although it acquired a spiritual quality in moments of inspiration ... Szigeti held the bow in an old-fashioned way, with the elbow close to the body, and produced much emphatic power, but not without extraneous sounds. Minor reservations, however, were swept aside {{by the force of}} his musical personality.|$|E
500|$|The {{songs were}} first {{published}} in Munich by Joseph Aibl. They were then published by Universal Edition. [...] "" [...] appeared also in English in a translation by John Bernhoff and Nelia Fabretto, in transpositions for low and high voice, and with an orchestral arrangement by Robert Heger. [...] Strauss quoted the music, as several other early works, in the fifth section of <b>his</b> <b>tone</b> poem [...] Ein Heldenleben (A Hero's Life), Op. 40, completed in 1898, which is usually considered autobiographical in tone.|$|E
500|$|As {{the poem}} {{comes to a}} close, the narrator once again {{addresses}} the urn as a single object. However, <b>his</b> <b>tone</b> becomes sharper as he seeks answers {{from the work of}} art that it appears unable to answer. In the final couplet, the poet provides a line for the urn, which complicates the narrative and has generated a multitude of critical responses as to the author's intent: [...] "Beauty is truth—truth beauty / that is all ye know on earth and all ye need to know" [...] (lines 49–50).|$|E
6000|$|... "I would, sir, {{that you}} had been of this opinion some hours earlier," [...] {{returned}} the Pilot, with a severity in <b>his</b> <b>tones</b> that even conveyed more meaning than his words.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll be over," [...] said Bince, [...] "as soon as I dress." [...] If {{there was}} any trace of {{surprise}} or shock in <b>his</b> <b>tones</b> the girl failed to notice it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Remain {{where you}} are, or your death {{will pay the}} penalty," [...] he cried, and there was that in <b>his</b> <b>tones</b> which told {{it would not be}} safe to disobey him.|$|R
