5000|$|A hex key, Allen key or Allen wrench {{is a tool}} used {{to drive}} bolts and screws with <b>hexagonal</b> <b>sockets</b> in their heads.|$|R
50|$|An air {{ratchet wrench}} {{is very similar}} to hand-powered ratchet {{wrenches}} in that it has the same square drive, but an air motor is attached to turn the <b>socket</b> <b>drive.</b> Pulling the trigger activates the motor which turns the <b>socket</b> <b>drive.</b> A switch is provided to change which direction the <b>socket</b> <b>drive</b> turns.|$|R
40|$|Addition of PTFE {{pressure}} pad increases utility of <b>hexagonal</b> <b>socket</b> wrench. Pad presses against opposing inside socket walls, causing frictional force that retains socket-head screw against gravitational and handling forces. Developed for spacecraft repairs, tool is useful wherever tight clearance prevents insertion or removal of screw by hand...|$|R
50|$|Rotary {{broaching}} {{is another}} common operation. The broach holder is mounted stationary while its internal live spindle and end cutting broach tool {{are driven by}} the workpiece. As the broach is fed into or around the workpiece, the broach's contact points are constantly changing, easily creating the desired form. The most common form made this way is a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>socket</b> {{in the end of}} a cap screw.|$|R
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1949 (as {{unveiled}} {{and demonstrated}} in October at the Motor Cycle Show at Earls Court, London) an optional mechanical reversing device became available which comprised a long lever with a ratchet and a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>socket</b> on the end which fitted onto {{the centre of the}} driver's side rear wheel hub. This device could then be operated from the driving seat and allowed the car to be cranked backwards by hand to assist with maneuvering.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} Dextre's {{arms are}} ORU/Tool Changeout Mechanisms (OTCM). The OTCM has {{built-in}} grasping jaws, a retractable <b>socket</b> <b>drive,</b> a monochrome TV camera, lights, and an umbilical connector that can provide power, data, and video to/from a payload.|$|R
5000|$|In 1909-1910, William G. Allen {{patented}} {{a method}} of cold-forming screw heads around a hexagonal die (...) [...] Published advertisements for the [...] "Allen safety set screw" [...] by the Allen Manufacturing Company of Hartford, Connecticut, exist from 1910.

50|$|The SPARCstation 20 has a {{built in}} 13W3 video <b>socket</b> <b>driven</b> by an {{optional}} SX (CG14) framebuffer built onto a VSIMM. The VSIMM {{is available in}} 4MB or 8MB capacity, capable of up to 1280x1024 (8MB) or 1152x900 (4MB) in 24-bit color. If two VSIMMs are installed an auxiliary video board must also be installed to provide a second 13W3 video socket. Alternatively, SBus cards can be used, including the ZX (Leo), Turbo GX (CG6) and others.|$|R
50|$|Head {{designs that}} overlap both are the Allen or Torx heads; <b>hexagonal</b> or splined <b>sockets.</b> These modern designs span a large range of sizes and {{can carry a}} {{considerable}} torque.|$|R
40|$|Effective extravehicular-activity (EVA) {{operations}} {{depend upon}} having the proper tools from simple wrenches to smart powered <b>socket</b> <b>drives</b> to powered adjustable foot restraints. The Space Shuttle carries a standard toolkit {{in the cargo}} bay for emergencies. Many special tools {{have been developed for}} the recent satellite repair missions; i. e., Solar Max, Westar/Palapa, and Leasat. Many more are being developed to maintain the Hubble Space Telescope on orbit for 15 years. The EVA tools developed and used in space to date are summarized and some of the new tools now in development are described herein. Finally, the requirements are given for several additional tools which may be needed in the future...|$|R
50|$|The use of psychosurgery {{increased}} {{during the}} 1940s, {{and there was}} a proliferation of the techniques used for the operation. In 1946 Freeman developed the transorbital lobotomy, based on a technique first reported by Italian psychiatrist Amarro Fiamberti. In this operation an ice-pick like instrument was inserted through the roof of the orbit (eye <b>socket),</b> <b>driven</b> in with a mallet, and swung to and fro to cut through the white matter. Freeman used electroconvulsive therapy in the place of a normal anaesthetic and carried out the operation without the aid of a neurosurgeon. This led to a rift with Watts. Freeman performed over 4,000 of these transorbital operations.|$|R

5000|$|Headless {{set screws}} {{have been around}} for a long time, with the {{straight}} slot being the oldest drive type (due to its ease of machining), but the demand for headless set screws experienced a marked increase in the first and second decades of the 20th century, when a penchant for better industrial safety, a campaign with the slogan [...] "safety first", swept the industrialized nations of North America and Europe as a part of the larger Progressive Movement. This surge in safety consciousness was a backlash against the often-atrocious industrial safety standards of the era. H.T. Hallowell, Sr., a U.S. industrialist whose corporation was one of several that pioneered the commercialization of the hex <b>socket</b> <b>drive,</b> noted in his memoir that line shafting, which was [...] in the industrial practice of the time, often had headed set screws (with external-wrenching square drive) holding the many pulleys to the line shafts, and collars holding the shafts from axial movement. Gear trains of exposed gears were also common at the time, and those, too, often used headed set screws, holding the gears to the shafts. His company's chief products at the time were shaft hangers and shaft collars of pressed-steel construction. The [...] "safety craze" [...] created a burgeoning demand for headless set screws on pulleys, gears, and collars to replace the headed ones, so that workers' clothing and fingers were less likely to catch on the exposed rotating screw head. It was this heightened demand that prompted Hallowell's firm to get into the screw-making business and to explore socket-head drive designs. With P.L. Robertson holding fresh patent rights on a practical-to-make square-socket drive, the firm soon pursued the hex <b>socket</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|R
50|$|Throughout the 19th century, {{the most}} {{commonly}} used forms of screw head (that is, drive types) were simple internal-wrenching straight slots and external-wrenching squares and hexagons. These were easy to machine and served most applications adequately. Rybczynski describes a flurry of patents for alternative drive types in the 1860s through 1890s, but explains that these were patented but not manufactured due to the difficulties and expense of doing so at the time. In 1908, Canadian P. L. Robertson was the first to make the internal-wrenching square <b>socket</b> <b>drive</b> a practical reality by developing just the right design (slight taper angles and overall proportions) to allow the head to be stamped easily but successfully, with the metal cold forming as desired rather than being sheared or displaced in unwanted ways. Practical manufacture of the internal-wrenching hexagon <b>drive</b> (hex <b>socket)</b> shortly followed in 1911.|$|R
5000|$|In his autobiography, {{the founder}} of the Standard Pressed Steel Company (SPS; now SPS Technologies, Inc.), Howard T. Hallowell Sr, {{presents}} a version of events in which SPS developed a hex <b>socket</b> <b>drive</b> in-house, independently of Allen, circa 1911. From this came the [...] line of products. This account from Hallowell does not mention the Allen patent of 1910, nor the Allen safety set screw product line. Hallowell does describe, however, the same inspiration also mentioned in connection with Allen for a wave of adoption of the hex socket head, beginning with set screws and followed by cap screws. This was an industrial safety campaign, part of the larger Progressive Movement, to get headless set screws onto the pulleys and shafts of the line shafting that was ubiquitous in factories of the day. The headless set screws {{would be less likely to}} catch the clothing of workers and pull them into injurious contact with the running shaft.|$|R
50|$|New Britain Machine Company was a tool {{company that}} was {{headquartered}} in New Britain, Connecticut. The company started to sell <b>sockets</b> and <b>drive</b> tools. New Britain was the main supplier for NAPA tools until its closure in 1990.

5000|$|A socket is {{typically}} a cylinder {{which has a}} female six- or twelve-point recessed opening sized to fit over the common male hexagonal head of a bolt or nut fastener. The {{opposite end of the}} socket wrench has a standardized (ANSI B107, ISO, or other consensus standard) square recess to accept the <b>socket</b> wrench's <b>drive</b> size. Male drivers are also produced for use with socket head cap screws, and are often called Allen drivers (trademark) or the generic term male bit drivers ...|$|R

40|$|A report {{describes}} an interface for utilizing {{some of the}} mobility features of a mobile robot for general-purpose manipulation of tools and other objects. The robot in question, now undergoing conceptual development for use on the Moon, is the All-Terrain Hex-Limbed Extra-Terrestrial Explorer (ATHLETE) rover, {{which is designed to}} roll over gentle terrain or walk over rough or steep terrain. Each leg of the robot is a six-degree-of-freedom general purpose manipulator tipped by a wheel with a motor drive. The tool interface includes a square cross-section peg, equivalent to a conventional socket-wrench drive, that rotates with the wheel. The tool interface also includes a clamp that holds a tool on the peg, and a pair of fold-out cameras that provides close-up stereoscopic images of the tool and its vicinity. The field of view of the imagers is actuated by the clamp mechanism and is specific to each tool. The motor drive can power any of a variety of tools, including rotating tools for helical fasteners, drills, and such clamping tools as pliers. With the addition of a flexible coupling, it could also power another tool or remote manipulator at a short distance. The <b>socket</b> <b>drive</b> can provide very high torque and power because it is driven by the wheel motor...|$|R

Backplanes are commonly found in disk enclosures, disk arrays, and servers.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the heads}} do look much the same, {{attempts}} {{to fit the}} wrong HQ number may fail; for example, an HQ5 head will not correctly engage with the spindle on a shaver model designed for an HQ3 or HQ4 head, due to a small extra piece of plastic in {{the centre of the}} HQ5 <b>drive</b> <b>socket.</b> Care should therefore be taken when choosing replacement parts.|$|R
50|$|By 28 February 1815 Stephenson {{had made}} enough {{improvements}} {{to file a}} patent with the overseer of the colliery, Ralph Dodds. This specified direct communication between cylinder and wheels using a ball and <b>socket</b> joint.

Sigmund Mandl went on to Blackhawk Manufacturing Company in 1931 after the Husky Wrench Company was bought by Olsen Manufacturing. During this time, New Britain Machine had a contract with Sears to supply <b>sockets</b> and <b>drive</b> tools for their Craftsman tool line. This contract survived until 1947 when the socket was gradually phased out and replaced by the [...] "V" [...] series sockets.

5000|$|Extant records suggest (without {{offering}} exhaustive documentation) {{that the}} idea of a hex <b>socket</b> screw <b>drive</b> was probably conceived as early as the 1860s to the 1890s, but that such screws were probably not manufactured until around 1910.

P. L. Robertson, of Milton, Ontario, Canada, first commercialised the square socket in 1908, having perfected and patented a manufacturing method (cold-forming, using the right material and the right die design).|$|R
50|$|At first, {{motor drives}} were {{external}} units that {{attached to the}} basic camera body, normally beneath it, with an interface consisting of a physical <b>drive</b> <b>socket</b> and some electrical contacts to signal the drive when to actuate. Beginning in the late 1970s, motor drives began to be integrated into cameras themselves - at first, in compact cameras for the beginner market, and by the 1980s, in amateur-grade and later professional-grade single lens reflex cameras. By the 1990s, {{the vast majority of}} 35mm cameras had integral motor drive, and the feature found its way into some medium format cameras as well.|$|R

30|$|The 5  mm borer {{requires}} smaller torque for coring. Due to its smaller reaction force, we used thinner reaction bar {{of smaller}} diameter and a lighter square <b>drive</b> <b>socket,</b> reducing the total weight to 6.0  kg (Table  1). Due {{to the larger}} torque required for sampling 12  mm cores, we had to increase the total weight of the device for sampling 12  mm cores to 9.5  kg. The rotation speed of the bit stayed almost constant irrespective of penetration depth and the wood species sampled. Using the gear ratios of 1 : 24 and 1 : 118, the penetration speeds of the 5 and 12  mm bits were approximately 50  cm and 12  cm per min, respectively (Table  1).|$|R
40|$|Data {{security}} using Cryptosteganography in {{web application}} is a {{web based application}} used to conceal important information through hybrid cryptography and Steganography and provide means of its secure transmission through any medium or channel. Using a web browser the user uploads the important information and an envelope image. The same is received by the Data Shielder facade web application. The web application sends the data and envelope image to the real Data Shielder. It generates a unique key and encrypts the crucial data. The key {{is associated with a}} "unique id " and preserved in a store. Then the encrypted information is embedded into the envelope image using modified BPCS technique.

The user can simply unzip the archive and transmit the stego image through unsecured channels like email, <b>sockets,</b> pen <b>drives,</b> cds, dvds, etc. And can keep the unique id safe. When the user wants its data back then user needs to upload the stego image and the "unique id " to the Data Shielder facade web application. The web application sends the unique id and stego image to the real Data Shielder. First it finds the encryption key from the store through the unique id. Next, reversing the BPCS Steganography, the stego image is processed and encrypted data is fetched. Finally using the encryption key decryption is done and the crucial data is fetched back.

5000|$|Socket {{wrenches}} {{are most}} commonly hexagonal, or more {{commonly referred to}} as [...] "6-point" [...] in lay terms. <b>Sockets</b> are <b>driven</b> by being attached to the driving tool via a male/female square connection fitting (called the square drive). Standard sizes of square drives around the world include 1/4", 3/8", 1/2", 3/4", 1", 1-1/2", 2-1/2" [...] and 3-1/2" [...] square drive sizes (a de facto international standard with no metric equivalents) along with some lesser used drivers such as 5/8" [...] square drive, and both #4 and #5 spline drives specified in ANSI B107 specifications. This wide range of square drive sizes provides {{for a wide variety of}} socket types and sizes to suit small to very large nuts and bolts. Some square drivers have a through hole to attach the socket to the driver (using a retaining ring with o-ring and pin type, or single piece molded retaining rings), a locking pin, or friction ball. Some common hand ratchets employ a quick release button on their top for quick socket release of smaller sockets.The tool chosen to <b>drive</b> the <b>socket</b> wrench ultimately supplies the mechanical advantage needed by the user to provide the torque needed to loosen or tighten the fastener as may be required. Larger drivers are typically used with higher torque, while smaller drivers are used for convenience in smaller low torque applications. Given the limits of human strength and fatigue, torque above 600 ft-lbs of torque will generally involve some kind of power assist, instead of the user simply pushing on the handle of a wrench. Very large sockets and drivers are typically powered by hydraulics to achieve torque.|$|R
40|$|Performance {{requirements}} in high end microprocessors have increased tremendously {{in the last}} several years, leading to higher I/O counts and interconnect densities. As greater currents pass through the microprocessor interconnect, higher temperatures driven by Joule heating are expected to pose reliability risks to high pin count microprocessor sockets. In this study Joule heating and its effect on the reliability of stamped metal land grid array (LGA) sockets was investigated using a combination of experimental and numerical methods. A methodology to determine socket temperature environments under electrical loading was developed. Knowledge of socket operating temperatures can allow original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and socket manufacturers to test for and mitigate failure mechanisms under thermal aging. The factors that influence Joule heating and contribute to premature socket failure were examined. Processor temperature, contact alloy and contact pitch were all found to significantly influence <b>socket</b> temperatures <b>driven</b> by Joule heating, with the contact alloy and processor temperature having the most significant effects. The resulting temperatures at higher currents were found to significantly influence the mechanical properties of the polymer housing and adversely affect socket stress relaxation behavior. The properties of the polymer housing were found to be sensitive to temperature owing to its visco-elastic nature. Polymer housing relaxation was therefore identified as a principle contributor to failure in stamped metal sockets under high temperature environments. In {{the latter part of the}} study, numerical modeling was used to develop a methodology for assessing socket life expectancy under temperature and deformation loads. A full visco-elastic characterization of the polymer housing was conducted and the measured properties were subsequently used to model socket stress relaxation time to failure. The results of this study indicate that socket temperatures under electrical loading can be significantly higher than those called for by EIA test specifications for LGA sockets. Passing tests that are not stringent enough to account for worst case scenarios can pave the way for field failures. The methodology outlined in this dissertation may be used to determine socket temperature environments and their effect on socket life expectancy...|$|R
50|$|According to one source, New Britain Machine {{was founded}} in New Britain, Connecticut in 1887. However, {{according}} to Archives & Special Collections at the Thomas J.

The first product the new company produced was a chainsaw mortising machine. In 1917, it registered the None Better trademark to sell its line of sockets and tools. Much of New Britain Machine's early tool production was done under the None Better line. Many of the early tools were carbon steel, offering a lower cost alternative to the higher price alloy steels of the day. Early tool sets consisted of hex <b>drive</b> <b>sockets</b> and an ell bar for the drive tool. Beginning in the 1930s, the None Better line consisted {{of a wide variety of}} 1/2 square drive tools with a Cadmium finish. At this time, New Britain Machine was also supplying tools for Sears in their Craftsman line of tools. These tools are easy to distinguish as they either have a BE or an H in a circle stamped into the tools. The New Britain Machine line was also created at this time as a higher priced alloy steel alternative.|$|R
