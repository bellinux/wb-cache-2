The new Executive Director, Kelvyn Anderson, stated that the [...] "nondisclosure {{agreement}} that the 2008 Police Advisory Commission entered into with the DA undermines our effectiveness and credibility as a civilian oversight board and compromises the openness and transparency that is our raison d’être.” Calling [...] "the magnitude of mismanagement of the Nizah Morris homicide [...] staggering," [...] Anderson sent a letter requesting a full investigation from U.S. Attorney Zane Memenger. The letter cites that the Philadelphia Police Department investigation was a [...] "litany of errors" [...] including procedural errors in policing, hospital errors, handling intoxicated persons, record keeping, logging <b>information,</b> <b>document</b> storage, hiding communications, [...] "off-the-record" [...] communiques, missing evidence, and testimony so inconsistent {{to rise to the}} level of perjury.|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} {{paper is}} {{an outgrowth of}} research performed with a data base of merged individual income tax returns and <b>information</b> <b>documents.</b> Tax Year 1989 was the first year for which such a data base was created and perfected. Traditionally, the Statistics of Income (SOI) Division of the Internal Revenue Service has interpreted its mandate to produce "statistics reasonably available {{with respect to the}} operations of the internal revenue laws " [1] as meaning tabulating data shown on tax returns. In recent years, with the computerization of the millions of <b>information</b> <b>documents</b> prepared by employers, banks, stock brokers, payers of pensions, etc., data from these documents have increasingly become "reasonably available. " Data from <b>information</b> <b>documents,</b> when matched to tax returns, can be used to serve as a check on the data shown on individual income tax returns, as well as to provide an indication of how much of the income on a joint return belongs to the husband and how much to the wife. In addition, it is possible to pull a sample of <b>information</b> <b>documents</b> that do not match to tax returns, and use them to tally data about non-filers. The data base used for this paper was created as a tool to compare tax return data to data gathered from <b>information</b> <b>documents.</b> It includes a sample of tax returns matched to <b>information</b> <b>documents,</b> as well as unmatched tax returns and unmatched <b>information</b> <b>documents.</b> The age of each individual in the sample was determined by matching his or her social security number (SSN) to the Year of Birth file, whic...|$|R
