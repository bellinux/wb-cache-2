5|$|<b>Industrial</b> {{conscription}} and {{the drive}} to increase productivity led to an increasing degree of <b>industrial</b> unrest over time. Many workers were required to work long hours in poor conditions and {{were not able to}} change their employment due to the manpower laws. Poor work conditions were exacerbated by the Government's austerity measures reducing workers' standards of living. As a result, strikes and other forms of protest disrupted Australian production, especially from 1943 onwards. These protests attracted considerable criticism from other civilians and members of the military. In May 1943 the Government introduced policies which enabled workers who were undertaking unlawful <b>industrial</b> action to be conscripted into the military, but this had little impact due to the shortage of skilled labour in the industries most prone to <b>industrial</b> disputes.|$|E
