40|$|This work aims to {{describe}} the basic principles and characteristics of economic rights in copyright with regard to historical development, international and European legal framework. Economic rights in copyright are divided into two groups, namely {{the right to use}} the work and other economic rights. The work is dedicated to both groups with an emphasis on the use of work by public, taking into account the current SDEU case law and the effects of international and European law. Attention is also paid to the wider concept of the thing in the legal sense, as the Civil Code adopted in 2012 introduced again explicitly the concept of intangible things. As a result, this work deals also with the issue of their transferability. The theoretical method of research is used in the thesis. Work is based mainly on the commentary literature to the copyright act and the rules governing copyright at national, international and European level. In regard to the fact that copyright law is constantly evolving and new forms of use are emerging the legislation cannot flexibly react to these changes and therefore also the relevant decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Czech courts are used. The work is systematically divided into three main chapters: (<b>i)</b> <b>general</b> <b>characteristics</b> of copyright, (ii) [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Low-quality {{obstetric care}} in low-and middle-income {{countries}} contributes to high in-hospital maternal mortality. Criterion-based clinical audits are increasingly {{used to measure}} and improve obstetric care in these settings. This article systematically reviews peer-reviewed literature to determine if these audits are feasible, valid and reliable measurement tools for assessing the quality of obstetric care. Data sources. PUBMED, Google Scholar and Web of Science databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles published between 1995 and 2009 and which used criterion-based clinical audits to measure the quality of obstetric care in low-and middle-income countries. Study selection. Sixty-nine studies were identified by key terms and subsequently reviewed. Ten were retained based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. Data extraction. (<b>i)</b> <b>General</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the study; (ii) compliance with expected standards of care and on maternal/child health outcomes; (iii) selection of the study population and sampling methods; and (iv) quality control and reliability. Results of data synthesis. Criterion-based clinical audit is increasingly used in low-and middle-income countries. Most audits were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. Studies had cross-sectional study or before-and-after designs. Sampling methods were poorly reported and selection bias was a concern. No studies compared audit against other measures of quality of care or against patient outcomes. Methods for quality control and assurance were generally not documented and reliability was mostly unaddressed. Conclusions. Criterion-based clinical audit appears feasible. No studies have rigorously evaluated its measurement properties in low-and middle-income countries. Without such evaluation, measurement properties of the audit remain under question...|$|E

Knowledge of seat contours of a student population could thus be useful in the design of school chairs. This study investigated seated buttock contours of senior high school students in order to determine: <b>i)</b> their <b>general</b> <b>characteristics,</b> ii) the effect of gender and sitting posture, and iii) the relationship between the contours and selected anthropometric variables (stature and mass). A contour measurement device was developed and used to measure buttock contours in five sitting postures (typing, sitting up, sitting back, slumping and writing). Buttock contours were quantified by constructing anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral profiles from which six discrete profile dimension measurements were made. AP and lateral profiles were found to have a consistent shape across all participants. Five out of six profile dimensions were significantly different between genders, with just one significantly different between sitting postures (typing and sitting back). Correlations between anthropometric measures and profile dimensions were relatively low (r < 0. 34) with no clear patterns evident. Overall {{results of this study suggest}} that buttock contours are influenced by gender to a greater extent than sitting posture. Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|This paper gives a {{detailed}} description of an algorithm for the solution of a specialized Linear Programming model, to be called the Machine Loading model. It is a generalization of the Transportation Problem, in that weighting factors are applied to the individual elements which form the row and column sums. For the Machine Loading model, the simplex method reduces to a specialized algorithm which generalizes the stepping stone method of the Transportation Problem [2], [3]. With the resulting generalized stepping stone method, it becomes practicable to solve many large-scale problems for which the direct application of the simplex method would be impracticable. The present paper is restricted to a discussion of the following topics: (<b>i)</b> the <b>general</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the model and its topological features; (ii) {{a detailed}} solution algorithm, including a consideration of degenerate cases and the use of a computer; (iii) a more restrictive capacitated model and the corresponding modifications to the solution algorithm; and (iv) the complete illustrative solution of a numerical example.

A brief description of some aspects of solar physics relevant {{to the study of}} solar noise is given, and the literature relating to the correlation of radio effects with solar disturbances is reviewed. Chapter II. A concise description of the apparatus constructed for the continuous recording of the flux density of solar radio noise at a frequency of 300 Mc/s is given, with some mention of difficulties experienced, and how these were overcome. Full circuit diagrams of electronic apparatus, and illustrative photographs, are supplied. Chapter III. The development of theories of the origin and propagation of solar noise radiation is historically reviewed and the success of each theory in explaining or predicting observed phenomena, is assessed. A working model is chosen from among these theories, and reasons for its adoption are given. Chapter IV. Observations made by the author of solar radiation at a frequency of 300 Mc/s are described, together with a description of the objects and methods, of analysis of the records. Chapter V. Phenomena observed by the author are compared with those observed by other workers. It is concluded that storm bursts are caused by transients similar to those producing Type II and Type ITI bursts, and a model for the production of storm bursts is tentatively suggested. Chapter VI.

The {{radiation}} we see from these sources originates in a jet of similar aperture angle, {{and we think}} it {{is the result of the}} conversion of some of the jet kinetic energy into random motion of the emitting particles.

40|$|The present {{review is}} {{concerned}} with studies which aimed at evaluating changes in spontaneous oral and written expression {{as a function of}} the normal aging process, by comparing the performance of older and younger adults on various discourse tasks. These studies are all based on analysis of language sample data collected from normal subjects in picture description tasks, expository discourse or narrative production tasks.

The general conclusions of this review are : (1) there is clearly no effect of aging on the lexical variety of spontaneous expression; (2) there is an overall decline in elderly adults' production of complex sentences, especially of left-branching constructions; (3) there is a substantial decline of discourse cohesion, mainly due to an increase of ambiguous references with age; and (4) there is a significant increase with age of the structural complexity of narratives (multiple and embedded episodes, but simple sentences) ...|$|R
