However, the output is called [...] "reverse" [...] acting if it's necessary to apply negative corrective action. For instance, if the valve in the <b>flow</b> <b>loop</b> was 100-0% valve opening for 0-100% control output - meaning the controller action has to be reversed. Some process control schemes and final control elements require this reverse action. An example would be a valve for cooling water, where the fail safe mode, {{in the case of}} loss of signal, would be 100% opening of the valve; therefore 0% controller output needs to cause 100% valve opening.|$|E

40|$|The paper raises {{awareness}} {{of the presence of}} closed parasitic <b>flow</b> <b>loops</b> in the solutions of published algorithm for maximising the throughput flow in networks. If the rooted commodity is interchangeable commodity, a closed parasitic loop can effectively be present even if the routed commodity does not physically travel along a closed loop. The closed parasitic <b>flow</b> <b>loops</b> are highly undesirable <b>loops</b> of <b>flow,</b> which effectively never leave the network. Parasitic <b>flow</b> <b>loops</b> increase the cost of transportation of the flow unnecessarily, consume residual capacity from the edges of the network, increase the likelihood of deterioration of perishable products, increase congestion and energy wastage. Accordingly, the paper presents a theoretical framework related to parasitic <b>flow</b> <b>loops</b> in networks. By using the presented framework, it is demonstrated that the probability of existence of closed and dominated <b>flow</b> <b>loops</b> in networks is surprisingly high. The paper also demonstrates that the successive shortest path strategy for minimising the total length of transportation routes from multiple interchangeable origins to multiple destinations fails to minimise the total length of the routes. It is demonstrated that even in a network with multiple origins and a single destination, the successive shortest path strategy could still fail to minimise the total length of the routes. By using the developed theoretical framework, it is shown that a minimum total length of the transportation routes in a network with multiple interchangeable origins, is attained if and only if no closed parasitic <b>flow</b> <b>loops</b> and dominated <b>flow</b> <b>loops</b> exist in the network. Accordingly, an algorithm for minimising the total length of the transportation routes by eliminating all dominated parasitic <b>flow</b> <b>loops</b> is proposed...|$|R

Previous studies indicated that the effective matrix diffusion coefficient values, obtained from {{a large number of}} field tracer tests, are enhanced in comparison with local values and may increase with test scale. In this study, we have performed numerical experiments to investigate potential mechanisms behind possible scale-dependent behavior. The focus of the experiments is on solute transport in flow paths having geometries consistent with percolation theories and characterized by local <b>flow</b> <b>loops</b> formed mainly by small-scale fractures. The water velocity distribution through a flow path was determined using discrete fracture network flow simulations, and solute transport was calculated using a previously derived impulse-response function and a particle-tracking scheme. Values for effective (or up-scaled) transport parameters were obtained by matching breakthrough curves from numerical experiments with an analytical solution for solute transport along a single fracture.

5000|$|The Heart, {{arteries and}} veins (a network of tubes to carry blood) {{constitutes}} the cardiovascular system or circulatory system of our body which transports the blood throughout the body. The heart {{can be thought}} of as a muscular pump, consisting of four chambers, and pulsatile muscles which pumps and circulates the blood through the vasculature. Arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules and veins make up the vasculature. The cardiovascular system circulates about 5 litres of blood at a rate of approximately 6 l/m. The pulmonary and the systemic circulations are the two parts of the vasculature. The pulmonary circulation system consists of the network of blood vessels from the right heart to the lungs and back to the left heart [...] The rest of the blood <b>flow</b> <b>loop</b> is called systemic circulation system. The pulmonary and systemic circulations take the blood through large arteries first and then branches into smaller arteries before reaching arterioles and capillaries. After capillaries, the blood enters the venules before joining smaller veins first and then larger veins before reaching the right heart. Thus completing the cycle of blood going to heart and then coming from it and going to all parts of the body.The tricuspid valve, right heart (right ventricle), pulmonary valve, pulmonary artery, lungs, pulmonary veins and right heart are the elements of the Pulmonary Circulation System. The process of gas exchange, that is, exchange of carbon dioxide with oxygen in the lungs, is the main function of the pulmonary system [...] The de-oxygenated blood from the right ventricle is pumped to the lungs where the capillaries surrounding the alveole sacks exchange carbon dioxide for oxygen. The red blood cells and the hemoglobin present in the blood, which is the main carrier of oxygen in the blood are responsible for this exchange of gases, before they are carried to the left ventricle of the heart. The systemic circulation is responsible for taking the oxygenated blood to various organs and tissues via the arterial tree before taking the deoxygenated blood to the right ventricle using the venous system (network of veins). Arteries carry the oxygenated blood while the veins carry the deoxygenated blood.|$|E

40|$|The Advanced Cuttings Transport Study (ACTS) was a 5 -year JIP project {{undertaken}} at the University of Tulsa (TU). The {{project was}} sponsored by the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) and JIP member companies. The objectives of the project were: (1) to develop and construct a new research facility that would allow three-phase (gas, liquid and cuttings) flow experiments under ambient and EPET (elevated pressure and temperature) conditions, and at different angle of inclinations and drill pipe rotation speeds; (2) to conduct experiments and develop a data base for the industry and academia; and (3) to develop mechanistic models for optimization of drilling hydraulics and cuttings transport. This project consisted of research studies, <b>flow</b> <b>loop</b> construction and instrumentation development. Following a one-year period for basic <b>flow</b> <b>loop</b> construction, a proposal was submitted by TU to the DOE for a five-year project that was organized in such a manner as to provide a logical progression of research experiments as well as additions to the basic <b>flow</b> <b>loop.</b> The <b>flow</b> <b>loop</b> additions and improvements included: (1) elevated temperature capability; (2) two-phase (gas and liquid, foam etc.) capability; (3) cuttings injection and removal system; (4) drill pipe rotation system; and (5) drilling section elevation system. In parallel with the <b>flow</b> <b>loop</b> construction, hydraulics and cuttings transport studies were preformed using drilling foams and aerated muds. In addition, hydraulics and rheology of synthetic drilling fluids were investigated. The studies were performed under ambient and EPET conditions. The effects of temperature and pressure on the hydraulics and cuttings transport were investigated. Mechanistic models were developed to predict frictional pressure loss and cuttings transport in horizontal and near-horizontal configurations. Model predictions were compared with the measured data. Predominantly, model predictions show satisfactory agreements with the measured data. As a part of this project, instrumentation was developed to monitor cuttings beds and characterize foams in the <b>flow</b> <b>loop.</b> An ultrasonic-based monitoring system was developed to measure cuttings bed thickness in the <b>flow</b> <b>loop.</b> Data acquisition software controls the system and processes the data.

However, many fundamental questions remain as to how these valves will function in vivo, and new in vitro tools need to be created to address these questions. Traditional in vitro heart valve testing devices (mock <b>flow</b> <b>loops)</b> are designed to subject valves to physiologic and pathologic hemodynamic conditions. These devices offer a heart valve designer a useful tool with which to evaluate the mechanical functioning of their device in a variety of well-controlled hemodynamic situations.

Consequently, a theorem giving the necessary and sufficient condition for a parasitic <b>flow</b> <b>loop</b> on randomly oriented source-destination paths in a plane has been formulated and a simple expression has been obtained for the probability of a directed <b>flow</b> <b>loop.</b> A closed-form expression has also been derived for determining the probability of a parasitic <b>flow</b> <b>loop</b> on a fixed lattice with flows whose directions are random. The results demonstrate that even for a relatively small number of intersecting flow paths, the probability of a directed <b>flow</b> <b>loop</b> is very large, which shows that the existence of directed flow loops in large and complex networks is practically inevitable. Consequently, a simple and efficient recursive algorithm has also been proposed for discovering and removing parasitic flow loops in real networks.

In this paper, we also raise awareness of a fundamental flaw of algorithms for maximising the throughput flow published since 1956.

The simulation study was derived {{on the basis of the}} Richards equation. The one-dimensional form of the Richards equation was used for the percolation process and the two-dimensional form of the Richards equation was used for the subsurface return flow process. In each case the Richards equation was transformed to a set of nonlinear algebraic equations using the finite element method to transform the space derivatives and the finite difference method to transform the time derivatives. The system of nonlinear algebraic equations were solved using the Gaussian elimination procedure and an under-relaxation procedure. To characterize the percolation and subsurface return flow processes a sensitivity analysis was performed by varying parameters of the soil systems. It was found that the relationships between stored soil moisture and deep percolation and between stored soil moisture and subsurface return flow each form hysteresis loops. The percolation loops were most sensitive to soil texture class, and water application rate. Soil layering, soil evaporation, water table depth, and evapotranspiration did not greatly influence the percolation loop.
