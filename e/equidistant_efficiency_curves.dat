40|$|The {{decline in}} the service flow from a stock of capital goods with age, due to the {{physical}} retirement of capital units and to the gradual loss of efficiency of each unit remaining, can be described by survival <b>curves</b> and <b>efficiency</b> <b>curves.</b> The paper reconsiders {{the relationship between these}} curves and the vintage prices of capital under neo-classical assumptions about perfect second hand markets and malleability, using duality between quantites and prices. Three examples with parametric survival and <b>efficiency</b> <b>curves</b> are presented. Concavity of the survival and <b>efficiency</b> <b>curves</b> may be compatible with convexity of the age-price profile. This approach is contrasted with the frequently cited Hulten-Wykoff approach. Empirical illustrations, focusing on the cenvexity/concavity issue, are given.

40|$|The {{removal of}} sewer solids at {{combined}} sewer overflow locations depends on the flow patterns inside the overflow structure {{on the one hand}} and on the sediment characteristics on the other hand. Flow conditions can be described by the residence time distribution; sewer sediments can be characterised by their settling velocity distribution. The combination of both distributions leads to a dimensionless <b>efficiency</b> <b>curve,</b> which gives the removal efficiency as a function of the Hazen number. For field conditions this <b>efficiency</b> <b>curve</b> is mainly influenced by the settling velocity distribution of the sewer sediments and, as a consequence, nearly identical <b>efficiency</b> <b>curves</b> are found for different types of prototype CSO structure.

40|$|The power <b>efficiency</b> <b>curves</b> of {{photovoltaic}} {{solar cells}} were investigated {{as a function}} of the forbidden energy gap (E sub g) and the current-voltage characteristic of the diode. Minority carrier injection, depletion layer recombination, and interface recombination terms were considered in models for the I-V characteristic. The collection efficiency for photons with energy between (E sub g) and an upper energy cutoff (E sub w) was assumed to be 100 % and zero otherwise. Results are presented in terms of a single parameter related to the ratio of depletion layer width and minority carrier diffusion length. It was found that increasing depletion layer recombination shifts the <b>efficiency</b> <b>curves</b> to larger values of the energy without changing the shape of the <b>efficiency</b> <b>curve</b> appreciably.

40|$|A neutron {{detector}} for {{the accurate}} measurement of relative neutron flux intensities in the keV energy region is described. The detector consists, in its simplest arrangement, of a paraffin pile and a NaI(Tl) detector {{to detect the}} 2. 2 MeV capture y-rays. The <b>efficiency</b> <b>curve</b> is relatively flat in the considered energy range. The <b>efficiency</b> <b>curve</b> depends only slightly on {{a change in the}} parameters used for its ca 1 culation. The application ofthe detector in neutron cross section experiments is described. that all neutrons are slowed down and captured in the moderator (no leakage). b. There should be no y-ray absorption in the sphere. With these assumptions and neglecting the capture in components of the moderator other than hydrogen, the 2. 2 -MeV y-ray flux integrated over the surface of the sphere is independent of the primary neutron energy of the source and equal to the neutron source strength. This means that the efficiency of the detector will be expected to be a constant. Due to this important basic principle of the detector, calculated <b>efficiency</b> <b>curves</b> taking into account the y-ray absorption in the sphere are very reliable as long as no neutron leakage occurs...|$|R

Special attention was paid to the body forces term of the momentum equation, a key aspect for thermosyphon system calculations. The models were verified and validated using a virtual test that numerically reproduces <b>efficiency</b> <b>curves</b> according to EN 12975 (2006). A virtual test generated to represent thermosyphon unsteady system conditions was used to analyze model response under transient conditions. The Extended Duffie–Beckman model was shown to perform well when submitted to strong unsteady boundary conditions such as inlet fluid temperature, irradiance and mass flow rate. The model based on the <b>efficiency</b> <b>curve</b> was shown to work well for time steps larger than the collector residence time. However, for lower time steps, the model was found to be inaccurate due to the hypothesis of a single control volume for the fluid analysis. For the same reason, besides the assumption of a first order temperature profile in the fluid flow, the model was not capable to predict a physical behavior when submitted to strong variations of the fluid inlet temperature.

Flue gases are condensed into liquid form, thus recovering their latent heat of vaporization, {{which results in}} as much as 10 %– 12 % increase in efficiency.
