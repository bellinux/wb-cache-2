5|$|In October 2008, {{staff at}} WhiteWater World stopped Paralympian Steve Simmonds from riding the slides. Simmonds was angry {{and stated that}} he <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> he was {{discriminated}} against. WhiteWater World cited manufacturer guidelines and safety concerns as the reasons behind the restrictions.|$|E
5|$|The {{world record}} jump was very smooth. It <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> I {{was lying on}} my stomach on a glass coffee table, {{watching}} a movie projected on a screen underneath the table. Although the flight was very smooth, {{it seemed like the}} movie projector was running the film faster than intended.|$|E
5|$|Game {{director}} Shigeki Morimoto {{aimed to}} respect the feelings of those who played the previous games, while also ensuring that it <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> a new game to those that {{were introduced to the}} series in more recent years. The games have received positive reviews from critics, and as of March 2014, the games' combined sales have reached 12.72 million, making the two games combined the eight best-selling DS game of all time.|$|E
50|$|This urban flood {{was very}} unexpected. The weather {{forecast}} identified {{it as an}} Low-pressure area, but it <b>felts</b> <b>like</b> a storm was coming. There {{was a lack of}} adequate drainage canals and to many clogged drainage in the areas. After the incident, officials took action on cleaning the drains so that this won't happen again.|$|R
60|$|He {{suddenly}} {{took the}} paper from her. It <b>felt</b> stiff, <b>like</b> {{a sheet of}} cartridge-paper.|$|R
60|$|I <b>felt</b> {{something}} <b>like</b> a pang when I {{thought how}} little trouble it had been.|$|R
5|$|I {{had that}} beat {{actually}} {{before she got}} to the studio. So she came in, she heard that beat and was like, 'Yeah, that's what I want.' That {{was one of the first}} records we had. I didn't really know what to do for her because I didn't hear nothing else that was on the album, but I just <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> she didn't have that bounce on her album.|$|E
5|$|It {{had a big}} impact. He was a {{founding}} member and really created the vocal style we are known for. Just <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> part of the band died too. Like when he died, it was just weird to think about doing shows or recording without him around, {{even if he was}} no longer in the band. He was a good person and definitely deserves to be remembered.|$|E
5|$|The {{thing about}} that song, it's such a passionate song. I had to present it in a passionate way, and I used mythology to tell the story, {{with the story of}} the Minotaur, the matador, {{fighting}} for love. And the color red. And flowers. Horns, and death. And naked men. You know, the important things in life. I don't want to make every video the same. But I did love the richness of that video. To me it <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> a painting that came to life. That's what I was trying to do.|$|E

60|$|Afterward {{the girl}} told {{how she had}} <b>felt</b> almost <b>like</b> weeping when she entered alone the dark, chilly opera house.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Jobson, junior, who {{had just}} {{come in from the}} shop, remarked, shortly, that he <b>felt</b> more <b>like</b> a {{blooming}} snowdrop.|$|R
5|$|We {{received}} daily e-mails with feedback {{that was}} concise, unambiguous and occasionally entertaining. She works extremely hard with gumption and detail, {{and it was}} clear to us how she has remained on top for twenty years. It was no use being unprepared with vague ideas disguised as creativity, and there was no place to hide... First it <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> doing nonsense, then it's fun and it's something that's going to be seen. The project brings us into contact with interesting actors within both film and music.|$|E
5|$|Alright, {{the main}} titles. Why the change? As you'll see here, the {{previous}} titles {{were such a}} high school aesthetic. It would have felt silly {{for me to go}} back to college with the same sort of look—the notebook paper. So it <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> we needed to change for college anyway. And in season one when we first did the titles, the network was very clear on wanting to sell it as a high school show rather than a noir show. But once we went to college and had a chance to redo the titles I wanted it to feel noir. For the new theme song, Thomas asked The Dandy Warhols to commission a remix of their original track, which Thomas reported enjoying upon first listening.|$|E
5|$|Benny was {{a tricky}} one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It {{was a little}} bit {{frustrating}} at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> I knew him very well.|$|E
50|$|Though The Penelopes won the Best Discovery 2007 Qwartz Electronic Music Award, they <b>felt</b> more <b>like</b> a {{rock band}} using {{electronic}} tools.|$|R
60|$|In {{the morning}} Giant <b>felt</b> quite <b>like</b> himself and insisted upon leaving off the bandage {{that had been}} placed over his forehead.|$|R
60|$|By morning Dave <b>felt</b> more <b>like</b> himself, and {{he would}} have gone ahead on the hunt, but Barringford would not permit it.|$|R
5|$|Brian and Stewie go to {{the mall}} so they can meet Santa, but Peter is asking Santa for gifts (he asks for a game of Uno, a Magna Doodle, a pet chink (a mix of a {{chinchilla}} and a mink) and a Charles in Charge lunchbox.) When the mall Santa leaves for the night and Brian demands that he let Stewie sit in his lap, Santa mentions he will be at Applebee's. Stewie says that Santa leaving before he got a chance to sit in his lap <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> a bigger betrayal than the betrayal of Gary Busey by reality; this takes us to Busey looking himself in the mirror asking his reflection, {{in the form of a}} crazed clown, how he is doing.|$|E
5|$|His {{work on the}} X-Men {{franchise}} {{would continue}} {{with a number of}} covers for The New Mutants and The Uncanny X-Men in 1986 and 1987, respectively. He also drew all but three of the first 23 covers and interior frontispieces to Classic X-Men from 1986 to 1988. His interior X-Men-related work included a two-issue run on X-Factor and the one-shot , both in 1989, and three Uncanny X-Men Annuals, in 1986, 1988 and 1990. It was in drawing the 1988 annual that Adams says he <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> a professional comic book artist for the first time, as he first felt confident that {{he knew what he was}} doing.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Applewhite met Bonnie Nettles, a nurse with an {{interest}} in theosophy and Biblical prophecy. The two quickly became close friends; he later recalled that he <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> he had known her {{for a long time and}} concluded that they had met in a past life. She told him their meeting had been foretold to her by extraterrestrials, persuading him that he had a divine assignment. By that time, he had begun to investigate alternatives to traditional Christian doctrine, including astrology. He also had had several visions, including one in which he was told that he was chosen for a role like that of Jesus. In her 2005 profile of Applewhite, Susan Raine speculates that he had a schizophrenic episode around this time.|$|E
60|$|Gee! I <b>felt</b> just <b>like</b> that myself. All day {{the country}} had been tugging at me, and now it tugged worse than ever.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} colearner agent performance and social behavior on learner performance and subjective satisfaction in an interactive learning environment. In this 2 (high- or low-performing colearner) by 2 (socially supportive or competitive colearner) experiment (N= 44), participants learned Morse Code alongside an agent colearner. Participants with highscoring colearner agents performed significantly better than participants with low-scoring colearners. Participants <b>liked</b> and <b>felt</b> <b>liked</b> by socially supportive agents {{more than they did}} socially competitive agent participants. Implications for developing educational software are discussed...|$|R
5|$|Jonathan Del Arco had {{no concept}} of what a Borg was prior to the audition. He {{received}} his script on the evening prior to meeting with the producers and felt that {{it gave him a}} decent sense of the character. Instead, Del Arco later explained that he was deliberately anti-social towards the other actors at the audition in order to get into Hugh's mindset. When he performed for the producers, someone else read the lines assigned to Picard and La Forge, and he <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> he immediately got a positive result. He received a call back, and returned to audition once more.|$|E
5|$|On 20 January 1942, Finucane {{was given}} command of No. 602 Squadron RAF at RAF Redhill. Five days later Group Captain Victor Beamish arrived {{as the new}} station commander. Beamish {{promoted}} Finucane instantly {{to the rank of}} squadron leader. Beamish had flown in the Battle of Britain and was posted to Group Captain Operations headquarters at 11 Group in 1941. Beamish frequently asked for an operational command and eventually Leigh-Mallory relented and gave him Redhill. Beamish was ordered not to fly on operations but usually flew whenever he <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> it. Beamish was killed on operations just two months later. Finucane observed 602's Glasgow traditions by reviving the squadron badge which pictured the Scottish lion rampant in red.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June 2010 Walton filmed {{her final}} scenes for the series, {{along with two}} fellow cast members Scare and Gerard McCarthy (who plays Kris Fisher). She spoke of her upset over leaving her fellow cast members, but later said she {{was looking forward to}} {{pursuing}} other projects. Walton also confirmed that she was happy the door was left open for a potential return, stating that she would consider reprising her role as Loretta in the future. Walton also said she understood why Marquess axed her character, he did not feel Loretta had anywhere left to go after the cancellation of her main storyline. However, she also <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> she deserved another chance to prove herself.|$|E

60|$|Anne {{had gone}} upstairs. She <b>felt</b> oddly <b>like</b> crying. But {{she made herself}} laugh instead. Rusty and Joseph had been TOO awful! And Dorothy WAS a dear.|$|R
5|$|Sam Jones III was {{the last}} of the season one series regulars to be cast–being hired just four days before filming for the pilot episode began. Jones, who is African American, was also cast against the Superman mythology where Pete Ross is Caucasian. Jones has stated that he would have {{understood}} if the producers had simply created a black character for him to portray, but the fact that they chose to go with him, even though the character has always been white, gave him more honor {{to be a part of}} the show. During the first season, Jones <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> he should have more screen time, but later conceded that the show was about Clark's journey and that the other characters are there to help his story move along.|$|E
5|$|The {{publication}} debuted {{at number}} one on the bestseller lists for The New York Times and The Globe and Mail, holding the position on the former for eleven consecutive weeks. Generally well received by critics, Outliers was considered more personal than Gladwell's other works, and some reviews commented on how much Outliers <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> an autobiography. Reviews praised the connection that Gladwell draws between his own background {{and the rest of the}} publication to conclude the book. Reviewers also appreciated the questions posed by Outliers, finding it important to determine how much individual potential is ignored by society. However, the lessons learned were considered anticlimactic and dispiriting. The writing style, though deemed easy to understand, was criticized for oversimplifying complex social phenomena.|$|E
5|$|This {{community}} {{also saw}} close collaboration between architects, specialist structural engineers, and building contractors emerge {{on the new}} skyscraper projects. Historically the industry had been dominated by individuals and small firms who combined the roles of architect and engineer, but this broke down in Chicago during the period, being replaced by a partnership between specialist architects who focused on {{the appearance of the}} skyscraper, and specialist engineers who focused on the structures that enabled it to be built. Chicago architectural firms grew to be large, hierarchical and with numerous specialist staff; the D. H. Burnham & Company, for example, <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> a small factory to visitors, and ultimately expanded to employ 180 staff.|$|E

60|$|It was over! And {{despite the}} {{imminent}} corporal punishment, Red <b>felt</b> something <b>like</b> a load fall from him. At least {{the decision was}} out of his hands.|$|R
60|$|This {{was one of}} {{the moments}} when he <b>felt</b> more <b>like</b> running away than fighting, but Jet took good care that he should not have an opportunity.|$|R
