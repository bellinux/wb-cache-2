25|$|The D.V {{version was}} a less radical {{departure}} from the earlier D.II version and mostly differed from the D.II, in having its four-member cabane strut structure supporting a central panel for the upper wing, rather than both upper wing panel's wing roots meeting along the centreline of the aircraft, for better forward pilot vision. It also used the D.III version's Argus As.II engine and changed the mounting position of the aircraft's 7.92mm (.312in) lMG 08 machine gun from the right {{to the left side}} of the nose. A total of 57 D.V aircraft were built, from orders placed in October 1916 and <b>January–June</b> 1917, with 31 of these being sent to Germany's ally in the Central Powers, the Ottoman Empire.|$|E

500|$|The law {{has caused}} a {{significant}} reduction in the number and percentage of people without health insurance. The CDC reported that the percentage of people without health insurance fell from 16.0% in 2010 to 8.9% during the <b>January–June</b> 2016 period. The uninsured rate dropped in every congressional district in the U.S. between 2013 and 2015. [...] The Congressional Budget Office reported in March 2016 that there were approximately 12 million people covered by the exchanges (10 million of whom received subsidies to help pay for insurance) and 11 million made eligible for Medicaid by the law, a subtotal of 23 million people. An additional 1 million were covered by the ACA's [...] "Basic Health Program," [...] for a total of 24 million. CBO also estimated that the ACA would reduce the net number of uninsured by 22 million in 2016, using a slightly different computation for the above figures totaling ACA coverage of 26 million, less 4 million for reductions in [...] "employment-based coverage" [...] and [...] "non-group and other coverage." ...|$|E

2500|$|The IRA {{leadership}} was deeply divided over {{the decision by}} the Dáil to ratify the Treaty. Despite the fact that Michael Collins – the de facto leader of the IRA – had negotiated the Treaty, many IRA officers were against it. Of the General Headquarters (GHQ) staff, nine members were in favour of the Treaty while four opposed it. Many of the IRA [...] were against the Treaty and in <b>January–June</b> 1922, their discontent developed into open defiance of the elected civilian Provisional government of Ireland. Anti-treaty writer Dorothy Macardle has claimed that 70 to 80 percent of the IRA was against the Treaty.|$|E
2500|$|The keel for Goliath {{was laid}} down on 4 January 1897, and the {{completed}} hull was launched on 23 March 1898.

Captain Frank Hannam Henderson was appointed in command 11 July 1902. She left the China Station in July 1903 and returned home, where she paid off into the commissioned Reserve at Chatham Dockyard on 9 October 1903. While in reserve, Goliath underwent a refit at Palmers on the Tyne from <b>January–June</b> 1904, then participated in maneuvers later in the year. On 9 May 1905, Goliath returned to full commission at Chatham to relieve her sister ship [...] on the China Station. However, Great Britain and Japan ratified a treaty of alliance while she was on her outbound voyage, allowing the Royal Navy to reduce its presence on the China Station and recall all battleships from those waters; when Goliath reached Colombo, Ceylon in June 1905, she was recalled, and was instead attached to the Mediterranean Fleet. In January 1906, she was transferred to the Channel Fleet.|$|E
