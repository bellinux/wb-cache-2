500|$|The {{episode was}} largely {{based upon the}} 1985 film Spies Like Us, which starred Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd, and the movie is {{mentioned}} in the episode itself. The episode was also based on the 1977 spy film Telefon about brainwashed Russian spies in the U.S. who can be activated by a special code phrase. When Peter {{has to go to}} the bathroom, he runs to Cleveland's empty home, which has been put up for sale since he left to live in Virginia with his new family. A montage of Peter going to the bathroom is shown, while Jennifer Lopez's [...] "Let's Get Loud" [...] plays. When Peter becomes aware that Cleveland's house is being rented by actors Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd, he mentions that he is honored to have dinner with [...] "two of the three Ghostbusters." [...] Chase then replies that he was not in that movie; Peter also notes that he is honored to meet [...] "two of the Three Amigos," [...] a movie starring Chase but not Aykroyd. After dinner, Stewie is seen drawing and coloring Sebastian the crab, a character from the Disney film The Little Mermaid. When Aykroyd and Chase ask Stewie and Brian <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> [...] "spies like us", Stewie asks if they can be [...] "spies like them" [...] and points to Black Spy and White Spy from Spy vs. Spy, one of the head comic strip features of MAD magazine. When Aykroyd and Chase explain to Stewie and Brian how they were recruited as official spies by Reagan, a cutaway is shown of an event in which 1985 is awarded the [...] "Awesomest Year of the 80's" [...] prize and all characters spontaneously start dancing to the 1983 song [...] "(Keep Feeling) Fascination." [...] Later, Brian and Stewie agree to become agents, and Stewie asks if [...] "Ron Howard's weird-looking brother is here." [...] There is a cutaway to The Brady Bunch, in which it is revealed Mike Brady killed his first wife, and housekeeper Alice walks in and demands a raise.|$|E

According to Abu Hozifa, a 29-year-old national security officer who teaches in the program, children are taught to [...] "honor the national flag and anthem, to strengthen their affinity with the homeland and Jerusalem, the spirit of resistance and the principles of steadfastness.

2500|$|The {{status of}} Abyei {{was one of}} the most {{contentious}} issues in the negotiation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. [...] The first protocol signed, the 2002 Machakos Protocol, defined Southern Sudan as the area as of independence in 1956. [...] It thus excluded the SPLA strongholds in Abyei, the Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile, known collectively during the talks as the Three Areas. [...] The SPLA negotiators then spent several years attempting to give these regions the right to a referendum in which they could decide <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> under the administrative control of the north or south. [...] This would potentially mean that these regions would become part of a nation of South Sudan after the 2011 independence referendum. [...] The government blocked these attempts, stating that the Machakos Protocol had already delineated the border for the Three Areas in favor of the north.|$|E

Politicians {{have been known to}} have many faces; it is a must <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to be everything for everyone. The Great and Terrible Wizard of Oz agrees to meet with each traveler separately, allowing him to alter his appearance to best fit each character. When the gang returns having completed the Wizard's task, they discover that the Wizard is a fake and is actually just [...] "a common man" [...] who has made everyone believe he was powerful. The Scarecrow adds that he is a humbug, in which the Wizard gladly says that is he is exactly that. The Wizard made promises he could not keep, as did many 19th-century politicians. The Wizard later states: [...] "How can I help being a humbug… when all these people make me do things that everyone knows can't be done," [...] showing {{that he was able to}} deceive others because others were willing to be deceived.|$|E

6000|$|In {{the things}} of the world, he had fences, and looked at some people through palings and even over the broken bottles {{on the tops of}} walls; and I think he was the loser by this, as well as they. But then I think all fences are bad, and that God has made enough {{differences}} between men; we need not trouble ourselves to multiply them. Even behind his fences, however, Holmes had a heart kind for the outsiders, and I do not believe any one came into personal relations with him who did not experience this kindness. In that long and delightful talk I had with him on my return from Venice (I can praise the talk because it was mainly his), we spoke of the status of domestics in the Old World, and how fraternal the relation of high and low was in Italy, while in England, between master and man, it seemed without acknowledgment of their common humanity. [...] "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "I always felt as if English servants expected to be trampled on; but I can't do that. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> trampled on, they must get some one else." [...] He thought that our American way was infinitely better; and I believe that in spite of the fences there was always an instinctive impulse with him to get upon common ground with his fellow- man. I used to notice in the neighborhood cabman who served our block on Beacon Street a sort of affectionate reverence for the Autocrat, which could have come from nothing but the kindly terms between them; if you went to him when he was engaged to Doctor Holmes, he told you so with a sort of implication in his manner that the thought of anything else for the time was profanation. The good fellow who took him his drives about the Beverly and Manchester shores seemed to be quite in the joke of the doctor's humor, and within the bounds of his personal modesty and his functional dignity permitted himself a smile at the doctor's sallies, when you stood talking with him, or listening to him at the carriage- side.|$|E
