5|$|In {{her later}} years, the Queen Mother became {{known for her}} longevity. Her 90th birthday—4 August 1990—was celebrated by a parade on 27 June that {{involved}} many of the 300 organisations of which she was patron. In 1995, she attended events commemorating {{the end of the}} war fifty years before, and had two operations: one to remove a cataract in <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>eye,</b> and one to replace her right hip. In 1998, her left hip was replaced after it was broken when she slipped and fell during a visit to Sandringham stables.|$|E
5|$|When {{the bust}} was first discovered, no piece of quartz to {{represent}} the iris of the left eyeball was present, as in the other eye, and none was found despite an intensive search and a then significant reward of £5 being put up for information regarding its whereabouts. Borchardt assumed that the quartz iris of the left eye had fallen out when the sculptor Thutmose's workshop fell into ruin. The missing eye led to speculation that Nefertiti may have suffered from an ophthalmic infection, and actually lost <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>eye,</b> though {{the presence of an}} iris in other statues of her contradicted this possibility.|$|E
5|$|Kotarou invites {{three other}} girls into the occult {{research}} society {{who are also}} heroines in the game. One is Kotori Kanbe, Kotarou's childhood friend in his class who has few friends and starts attending school regularly after joining the club. She has a playful personality and has an extremely strong pet dog named Chibi-Moth, which is actually a familiar created by Kotori {{from the body of}} her dead pet dog Pero. However, she is not affiliated with Gaia or Guardian, and instead follows in the path of an ancient sect of summoners called Druids who revered nature and protected Kagari with familiars. Another heroine is first-year student Sizuru Nakatsu, a shy girl on the public morals committee who has excellent hearing, eyesight and can read lips. She has heterochromia, though wears an eyepatch over her golden-colored right eye as she is very self-conscious about it; <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>eye</b> is blue. Sizuru is a member of Guardian who has the ability to produce various chemicals inside her body which can be used to heal herself and others, paralyze and cause amnesia. Sizuru joins the club with her close friend Lucia Konohana, another heroine and the class representative of Kotarou's class. Lucia is easily agitated by the antics of boys and often punches Kotarou when he annoys her. She is obsessed with cleanliness and always wears gloves. Like Sizuru, Lucia is a member of Guardian and has the ability to produces poisonous miasma and pus {{as a result of an}} experiment by Guardian, which she takes medication for to suppress. She can also create vibrations within the objects she touches and break glass at a distance. Both Lucia and Sizuru have superhuman speed, agility, and reflexes in addition to their other abilities.|$|E

25|$|TLC's debut album, chiefly {{written by}} Dallas Austin and Lisa Lopes, {{consisted}} of playful lyrics, with some female-empowering songs. It {{was characterized by}} Watkins' low-register contralto vocals, Thomas's higher-register mezzo-soprano vocals, and Lopes's quirky soprano raps. The musical formula was augmented by the girls' brightly colored videos and curious costuming: each girl wore wrapped condoms on their clothing (Lopes also wore one over <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>eye</b> {{in a pair of}} glasses).|$|E
25|$|She was {{comatose}} for 12 days. She suffered severe hypothermia, severe brain damage, Class 4 (the most severe) hemorrhagic shock, {{and loss}} of 75–80 percent of her blood from five deep stab wounds and a gash {{on one of her}} thighs, and internal bleeding. Her skull had been fractured so badly that <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>eye</b> was dislodged from its socket, which in turn was fractured in 21 places, and she suffered as well from facial fractures.|$|E

40|$|Acquired Toxoplasma gondii ocular {{infection}} usually presents with necrotizing retinochoroiditis with dense vitritis and vasculitis. Atypical {{disease has}} been observed in immunocompromised states such as malignancy and AIDS 1 or after iatrogenic systemic 2 or local 3 immunosuppression. Intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (TA) is used frequently by ophthalmologists for conditions like uveitis and diabetic macular edema. However, its unscrupulous use may have dismal consequences. We recently managed a case of fulminant retinal necrosis after intravitreal TA in a patient with previously undiagnosed ocular toxoplasmosis. This 53 -year-old Malay woman with diabetes consulted an ophthalmologist for blurring of vision in the <b>left</b> <b>eye.</b> On examination, <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>eye’s</b> best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20 / 1200.

25|$|On 4 November 1849, when Blackwell was {{treating}} {{an infant}} with ophthalmia neonatorum, she spurted some contaminated solution {{into her own}} eye accidentally, and contracted the infection. She lost sight in <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>eye,</b> causing her to have her eye surgically extracted and thus lost all hope of becoming a surgeon. After a period of recovery, she enrolled at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London in 1850. She regularly attended James Paget's lectures.

Kuragari, Proctor of the Crimson Dawn, tried to claim Betsy as his bride, but was thwarted with Gomurr and Angel's aid, freeing Betsy of the Dawn's influence.

40|$|Abstract: A 30 -year-old female {{patient was}} {{referred}} to our institution due to vitreous hemorrhage. Best corrected visual acuity of <b>her</b> right and <b>left</b> <b>eyes</b> at <b>her</b> initial visit was 10 / 20 and 20 / 20, respectively. Although hypochromic iris was observed in the superior iris between the 10 and 2 o’clock positions in her right <b>eye,</b> <b>her</b> entire <b>left</b> <b>eye</b> exhibited hypochromic iris. Hypopigmentation of the fundus {{was seen in the}} superior part of her right eye. This eye also had a huge neovascularization on the optic disc that was 7 discs in diameter. Conversely, <b>her</b> <b>left</b> fundi showed hypopigmentation of the fundus in the entire region of the <b>left</b> <b>eye,</b> and dot hemorrhages were observed all over the left fundi, although no neovascularization could be seen microscopically. Fluorescein angiography showed a huge neovascularization in the right eye and a tiny neovascularization in the <b>left</b> <b>eye.</b> Gene analysis revealed the presence of the PAX 3 gene homeobox domain mutation, which led to her being diagnosed as Waardenburg syndrome type 1. Magnetic resonance angiography showed there was no obstructive region at either of the internal carotid arteries and ophthalmic arteries.

Fundus examination revealed cystoid macular oedema (CME) in the <b>left</b> <b>eye,</b> which was confirmed in optical coherence tomography (OCT) with thickness of 422  μ. She was started on topical nepafenac, and dose of oral steroid was hiked up to 50  mg/day.|$|R
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} attack, Piper {{ran into a}} local café, where an {{ambulance}} was called. Crews had to wait an hour before being able to treat Piper, {{because of the risk}} presented by the acid, which was still unidentified at that point, and because Sylvestre could still have been nearby. Piper was treated in Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, where her treatment was led by Dr. Mohammad Ali Jawad. The acid, some of which Piper had swallowed, blinded her in <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>eye,</b> and caused partial thickness and full thickness burns. The surgeons completely removed the skin of Piper's face, and replaced it with a skin substitute, Matriderm, to build the foundations for a skin graft. This procedure was {{the first of its kind}} to be done in a single operation.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} season finale, Cameron denies that {{exposure}} to Terminators and their shielded nuclear power cells cause cancer in humans, as John believes that if his mother is sick it could be from living with her for so long. Cameron states that she has internal sensors to detect radiation leakage. While rescuing Sarah from the Los Angeles County lockup, Cameron sustains heavy damage, including the loss of <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>eye</b> covering. Cameron then enters the basement of ZeiraCorp to find John Henry. The cyborg's body is subsequently found inside the room where John Henry was kept, but missing its chip; the original chip (from Cromartie) was destroyed by Sarah Connor. When John and the T-1001 give chase into the future, a character portrayed by Summer Glau is present, but it is Allison Young, and not Cameron, as Josh Friedman stated in the audio commentary to the finale episode of the show (the dog is not barking at her and she acts as a human female rather than as Cameron).|$|E
25|$|A 31-year-old woman {{went to her}} {{physician}} {{because of}} decreased vision in <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>eye.</b> The left eye showed fibrinous exudates, posterior synechiae and vitritis. After a vitreous sample {{was sent to the}} lab for identification, the yeast was identified as Sporobolomyces salmonicolor. The recommended treatment was voriconazole 200mg, twice a day for two months. Improvement in the left eye was seen within a week. Exposure to mould and yeast within a military hospital in Finland lead to an outbreak of asthma, alveolitis and rhinitis. The building was known to have severe water and mould damage. After performing inhalation provocation tests, four cases of asthma caused by Sporobolomyces salmonicolor were reported. An additional seven workers were diagnosed with rhinitis. All seven individuals with rhinitis acted positively in nasal S.salmonicolor provocation tests. Sporobolomyces salmonicolor was recovered from the cerebrospinal fluid of three patients in a hospital, one of whom was a kidney transplant recipient. Heavy growth of S.salmonicolor was recovered from utility rooms on the floors of each patient, and from the hospital rooms of two patients. It was suggested that this particular case was most likely caused by contamination. During the collection process, S.salmonicolor was most likely introduced into the CSF as a contaminant.|$|E

The severity of the diabetic retinopathy appeared to be correlated with the degree of hypopigmentation in the posterior fundus. We speculate that hypopigmentation of the fundus in Waardenburg syndrome may be responsible for the reduction in retinal metabolism, which led to a reduction in oxygen consumption and prevented further aggravation of the diabetic retinopathy. Only laser treatments using short wavelengths was effective in this case. While the extinction coefficient for hemoglobin when using green light is higher than when using yellow light, the differences between these wavelengths tend to disappear when oxygenated hemoglobin is present. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first case report of a patient with Waardenburg syndrome and diabetic retinopathy...|$|R

The following day Anderson defeated Misaki Ohata on Volume 31 and Ayako Hamada in the main event of Volume 32, before demanding a title match from the new Shimmer Champion Eagles. She received her title match on September 11, 2010, on Volume 33, but {{was defeated}} by Eagles. The following day on Volume 36 Melissa pinned Eagles to win an eight-woman elimination tag team match, where she, Ayako Hamada, Ayumi Kurihara and Serena Deeb defeated Eagles, Daizee Haze, Sara Del Rey and Tomoka Nakagawa. On October 2, 2011, at Volume 43, Melissa defeated Kana to become the number one contender to the Shimmer Championship. Later that same day on Volume 44, Melissa defeated Madison Eagles to become the fourth Shimmer Champion. During her title celebration, she was attacked from behind by Nicole Matthews. Melissa made her first two title defenses on March 17, 2012, defeating Nicole Matthews on Volume 45 and Portia Perez on Volume 46. The following day, after successfully defending the Shimmer Championship against Jessie McKay on Volume 47, Melissa lost the title to Saraya Knight on Volume 48. After pinning Knight to win a ten-woman elimination tag team match on October 28 at the tapings of Volume 50, Melissa was granted a rematch for the Shimmer Championship the following day on Volume 52, but was defeated after being hit with the title belt. On April 6, 2013, at the Volume 53 internet pay-per-view (iPPV) in Secaucus, New Jersey, Melissa defeated Knight in a steel cage match to win the Shimmer Championship for the second time. Melissa made her first successful title defense a week later on April 13 at Volume 54, where she defeated Mercedes Martinez. Later that same day on Volume 55, Melissa made another successful title defense against Courtney Rush. The following day on Volume 56, Melissa made her third and final title defense of the weekend by defeating Kalamity. Later that same day on Volume 57, Melissa took part in Allison Danger's retirement match, where she and Ayako Hamada faced Danger and Leva Bates. Melissa initially submitted Danger for the win, but the decision was reversed when Melissa turned heel and refused {{to let go of}} the hold after the match. Post-match, the evil Melissa completed her heel turn by attacking Hamada. On October 19 at Volume 58, Melissa made her fourth successful title defense against Leva Bates. Post-match Melissa attacked both Bates and the retired Allison Danger, before being chased away by LuFisto. Later that same day, after another successful defense against Hiroyo Matsumoto on Volume 59, Melissa was again run off by LuFisto, who was, as a result, named the next challenger for her Shimmer Championship. The title match between Melissa and LuFisto took place on the following day's Volume 60 and saw Melissa retain the title. Following the match, Melissa was taken to a local hospital, where she received ten stitches above <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>eye.</b> As a result, Volume 61 became the first Volume in Shimmer history, which did not feature a Cheerleader Melissa match. On April 5 at the Volume 62 iPPV in New Orleans, Louisiana, Melissa successfully defended the Shimmer Championship against LuFisto in a two out of three falls match, following outside interference from Mercedes Martinez. A week later on Volume 64, Melissa made another successful title defense against Japanese wrestler Yumi Ohka.
