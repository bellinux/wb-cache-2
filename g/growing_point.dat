5|$|In the autumn, {{the leaves}} die {{back and the}} outer scales of the bulb become dry and brittle, so the crop is then {{normally}} harvested. If left in the soil over winter, the <b>growing</b> <b>point</b> {{in the middle of}} the bulb begins to develop in the spring. New leaves appear and a long, stout, hollow stem expands, topped by a bract protecting a developing inflorescence. The inflorescence takes the form of a globular umbel of white flowers with parts in sixes. The seeds are glossy black and triangular in cross section.|$|E

40|$|New lobe {{development}} and lobe division was {{studied in the}} foliose lichen Xanthoparmelia conspersa (Ehrh. ex. Ach.) Hale. In thalli with either the centre or margin removed, the inside edge of the perimeter, {{the outer edge of}} the reproductive centre, and fragments derived from the thallus perimeter all regenerated <b>growing</b> <b>points</b> (‘lobe primordia’) within a year. Thalli possessing isidia had the greatest ability to regenerate <b>growing</b> <b>points.</b> In reproductive thalli, there was a positive correlation between the density of new <b>growing</b> <b>points</b> and thallus size. When fragments were cut from the perimeters of mature X. conspersa thalli and glued to pieces of slate, the ratio of <b>growing</b> <b>points</b> to mature lobes increased over 54 months. Lobes within a thallus exhibited different degrees of bifurcation. In some bifurcating lobes, the point of origin of the bifurcation advanced at the same rate as the lobe tips over 4 months but in most lobes, the bifurcation point either advanced less rapidly than the lobe tips or retreated from its original location. Removing adjacent lobes had no significant effect on the radial growth of a lobe over 4 months or on the location of the bifurcation point but it increased the number of <b>growing</b> <b>points.</b> These results suggest that for X. conspersa: 1) all portions of of thalli can regenerate <b>growing</b> <b>points,</b> 2) few <b>growing</b> <b>points</b> actually develop into mature lobes, 3) individual lobes within a thallus grow and divide differently, and 4) adjacent lobes inhibit the development of <b>growing</b> <b>points</b> on their neighbours...|$|R

25|$|Two to {{four months}} after the fungus has {{infected}} the plant, black whip-like structures, instead of a spindle leaf, emerge from the meristem, or <b>growing</b> <b>point,</b> of the plant. The developing whip is a mixture of plant tissue and fungal tissue. The whip reaches maturity between the sixth and the seventh month. When spores that are contained inside the whip are released, the core of the whip remains behind and is a straw-like color.|$|E
25|$|Sarracenia are {{herbaceous}} {{perennial plants}} that grow from a subterranean rhizome, with many tubular pitcher-shaped leaves radiating {{out from the}} <b>growing</b> <b>point,</b> and then turning upwards with their trap openings facing {{the center of the}} crown. The trap is a vertical tube with a 'hood' (the operculum) extending over its entrance; and below it the top of the tube usually has a rolled lip (the peristome) which secretes nectar and scents. The hood itself frequently produces nectar too, but in lesser quantities.|$|E
25|$|Stolons {{arise from}} the base of the plant. In {{strawberries}} the base is above the soil surface; in many bulb-forming species and plants with rhizomes, the stolons remain underground and form shoots that rise to the surface at the ends or from the nodes. The nodes of the stolons produce roots, often all around the node and hormones produced by the roots cause the stolon to initiate shoots with normal leaves. Typically after the formation of the new plant the stolon dies away in a year or two, while rhizomes persist normally for many years or for the life of the plant, adding more length each year to the ends with active growth. The horizontal growth of stolons results from the interplay of different hormones produced at the <b>growing</b> <b>point</b> and hormones from the main plant, with some studies showing that stolon and rhizome growth are affected by the amount of shady light the plant receives with increased production and branching from plants exposed to mixed shade and sun, while plants in all day sun or all shade produce fewer stolons.|$|E

500|$|L. williamsii is {{native to}} {{northern}} Mexico and southern Texas. Individual stems are about [...] high with a diameter of , and {{may be found in}} clumps up to [...] wide. A large part of the stem is usually below ground. Mescaline is concentrated in the photosynthetic portion of the stem above ground. The center of the stem, which contains the <b>growing</b> <b>point</b> (the apical meristem), is sunken. Experienced collectors of peyote remove a thin slice {{from the top of the}} plant, leaving the <b>growing</b> <b>point</b> intact, thus allowing the plant to regenerate. Evidence indicates peyote was in use more than 5,500 years ago; dried peyote buttons presumed to be from a site on the Rio Grande, Texas, were radiocarbon dated to around 3780–3660 BC. Peyote is perceived as a means of accessing the spirit world. Attempts by the Roman Catholic church to suppress its use after the Spanish conquest were largely unsuccessful, and by the middle of the 20th century, peyote was more widely used than ever by indigenous peoples as far north as Canada. It is now used formally by the Native American Church.|$|E
500|$|Trees do {{not usually}} grow {{continuously}} {{throughout the year}} but mostly have spurts of active expansion followed by periods of rest. This pattern of growth is related to climatic conditions; growth normally ceases when conditions are either too cold or too dry. In readiness for the inactive period, trees form buds to protect the meristem, the zone of active growth. Before the period of dormancy, the last few leaves produced {{at the tip of}} a twig form scales. These are thick, small and closely wrapped and enclose the <b>growing</b> <b>point</b> in a waterproof sheath. Inside this bud there is a rudimentary stalk and neatly folded miniature leaves, ready to expand when the next growing season arrives. Buds also form in the axils of the leaves ready to produce new side shoots. A few trees, such as the eucalyptus, have [...] "naked buds" [...] with no protective scales and some conifers, such as the Lawson's cypress, have no buds but instead have little pockets of meristem concealed among the scale-like leaves.|$|E
2500|$|Outside of a laboratory, {{the only}} {{effective}} asexual propagation method is rhizome division. This uses material {{from a single}} parent, and {{as there is no}} exchange of genetic material, it almost always produces plants that are identical to the parent. After a summer’s growth, the horticultural cultivars can be separated into typically four or five separate smaller rhizomes, each with a growing nodal point ('growing eye'). [...] Without the <b>growing</b> <b>point,</b> which is composed of meristem material, the rhizome will not grow.|$|E
50|$|When soil-{{potassium}} {{levels are}} high, plants take up more potassium than needed for healthy growth. The term luxury consumption {{has been applied}} to this. When potassium is moderately deficient, the effects first appear in the older tissues, and from there progress towards the <b>growing</b> <b>points.</b> Acute deficiency severely affects <b>growing</b> <b>points,</b> and die-back commonly occurs. Symptoms of potassium deficiency in white spruce include: browning and death of needles (chlorosis); reduced growth in height and diameter; impaired retention of needles; and reduced needle length. A relationship between potassium nutrition and cold resistance has been found in several tree species, including two species of spruce.|$|R

2500|$|Auxins are {{compounds}} that positively influence cell enlargement, bud formation and root initiation. They also promote {{the production of}} other hormones and in conjunction with cytokinins, they control the growth of stems, roots, and fruits, and convert stems into flowers. [...] Auxins were the first class of growth regulators discovered. They affect cell elongation by altering cell wall plasticity. They stimulate cambium, a subtype of meristem cells, to divide and in stems cause secondary xylem to differentiate. Auxins act to inhibit the growth of buds lower down the stems (apical dominance), and also to promote lateral and adventitious root development and growth. [...] Leaf abscission is initiated by the <b>growing</b> <b>point</b> of a plant ceasing to produce auxins. [...] Auxins in seeds regulate specific protein synthesis, as they develop within the flower after pollination, causing the flower to develop a fruit to contain the developing seeds. Auxins are toxic to plants in large concentrations; they are most toxic to dicots and less so to monocots. Because of this property, synthetic auxin herbicides including 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T have been developed and used for weed control. Auxins, especially 1-Naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), are also commonly applied to stimulate root growth when taking cuttings of plants. [...] The most common auxin found in plants is indole-3-acetic acid or IAA. The correlation of auxins and cytokinins in the plants is a constant (A/C = const.).|$|E
