5|$|Blood {{and urine}} samples {{indicated}} {{that she had}} taken the anti-psychotic drug <b>haloperidol,</b> and several days earlier had used cannabis. There were no marks on her body suggestive of a struggle. The firearms officer who first saw her said her feet and hands were clean, her fingernails manicured and not broken, and her fingertips free of blood, dirt or powder. There was no trace of lead dust. The rifle magazine would have been loaded at least twice during the killings; this would usually leave lubricant and material from the bullets on the hands. A scenes-of-crimes officer, DC Hammersley, said there were bloodstains {{on the back of}} her right hand, but that otherwise her hands were clean.|$|E
5|$|Mephedrone {{is often}} {{consumed}} with alcohol. A study in mice investigated the interrelation {{between these two}} substances, focusing on the psychostimulant and rewarding properties of mephedrone. It found that at low (non stimulant) doses alcohol significantly enhanced the psychostimulant effects of mephedrone. This effect was mediated {{by an increase in}} synaptic dopamine, as <b>haloperidol,</b> but not ketanserin, was able to block the potentiation by alcohol. Similarly, the rewarding properties of mephedrone were enhanced by a low non-rewarding dose of alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people on}} {{antipsychotics}} have side effects. People on typical antipsychotics {{tend to have}} a higher rate of extrapyramidal side effects, while some atypicals are associated with considerable weight gain, diabetes and risk of metabolic syndrome; this is most pronounced with olanzapine, while risperidone and quetiapine are also associated with weight gain. Risperidone has a similar rate of extrapyramidal symptoms to <b>haloperidol.</b> It remains unclear whether the newer antipsychotics reduce the chances of developing neuroleptic malignant syndrome or tardive dyskinesia, a rare but serious neurological disorder.|$|E
5|$|Medication is {{available}} to help when symptoms interfere with functioning. The classes of medication with the most proven efficacy in treating tics—typical and atypical neuroleptics including risperidone (trade name Risperdal), ziprasidone (Geodon), <b>haloperidol</b> (Haldol), pimozide (Orap) and fluphenazine (Prolixin)—can have long-term and short-term adverse effects. The antihypertensive agents clonidine (trade name Catapres) and guanfacine (Tenex) are also used to treat tics; studies show variable efficacy, but a lower side effect profile than the neuroleptics. Stimulants and other medications {{may be useful in}} treating ADHD when it co-occurs with tic disorders. Drugs from several other classes of medications can be used when stimulant trials fail, including guanfacine (trade name Tenex), atomoxetine (Strattera) and tricyclic antidepressants. Clomipramine (Anafranil), a tricyclic, and SSRIs—a class of antidepressants including fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), and fluvoxamine (Luvox)—may be prescribed when a Tourette's patient also has symptoms of obsessive–compulsive disorder. Several other medications have been tried, but evidence to support their use is unconvincing.|$|E
5|$|Wilson tricks Neto {{and brings}} {{him to a}} {{hospital}} where he is forcibly admitted without any examination to verify its necessity. Neto is sedated by a nurse before receiving the diagnosis of Dr. Cintra. When he wakes up, Neto encounters Ceará, a hyperactive man, and finds out the hospital is decaying and careless. He also meets Rogério, an injectable drugs user committed by his family, who tells him {{it is impossible to}} escape and that if he were to try he would be drugged with <b>haloperidol</b> or electrocuted. Rogério also tells him not to consume the medications administered by nurses because it awakes the appetite in order to make patients look healthier. Meanwhile, Cintra has a conversation in which he discusses that if necessary he could easily admit more people, mostly homeless, to avoid losing the government subsidy.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybin {{is rapidly}} dephosphorylated {{in the body}} to psilocin, which is a partial agonist for several {{serotonin}} receptors, which are also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors. Psilocin has a high affinity for the 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors in the human brain, and with a slightly lower affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor. Psilocin binds with low affinity to 5-HT1 receptors, including 5-HT1A and 5-HT1D. Serotonin receptors are located in numerous parts of the brain, including the cerebral cortex, and {{are involved in a}} wide range of functions, including regulation of mood and motivation. The psychotomimetic (psychosis-mimicking) effects of psilocin can be blocked in a dose-dependent fashion by the 5-HT2A antagonist drug ketanserin. Various lines of evidence have shown that interactions with non-5-HT2 receptors also contribute to the subjective and behavioral effects of the drug. For example, psilocin indirectly increases the concentration of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the basal ganglia, and some psychotomimetic symptoms of psilocin are reduced by <b>haloperidol,</b> a non-selective dopamine receptor antagonist. Taken together, these suggest that there may be an indirect dopaminergic contribution to psilocin's psychotomimetic effects. Unlike LSD, which binds to D2-like dopamine receptors in addition to having strong affinity for several 5-HT receptors, psilocybin and psilocin have no affinity for the dopamine D2 receptors.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{extensive}} research into metallopharmaceuticals, including discussion of rhodium compounds in medicine. A substantial {{body of research}} has examined using metallocene derivatives of ruthenium and iron as metallopharmaceuticals. One area of such research has utilised metallocenes {{in place of the}} fluorophenyl group in <b>haloperidol,</b> which is a pharmaceutical classified as a typical antipsychotic. The ferrocenyl–haloperidol compound investigated has structure (C5H5)Fe(C5H4)–C(=O)–(CH2)3–N(CH2CH2)2C(OH)–C6H4Cl and can be converted to the ruthenium analog via a transmetalation reaction. Using the radioactive isotope 103Ru produces a ruthenocenyl–haloperidol radiopharmaceutical with a high affinity for lung but not brain tissue in mice and rats. Beta-decay of 103Ru produces the metastable isotope 103mRh in a rhodocenyl–haloperidol compound. This compound, like other rhodocene derivatives, has an unstable 19-valence electron configuration and rapidly oxidises to the expected cationic rhodocenium–haloperidol species. The separation of the ruthenocenyl–haloperidol and the rhodocenium–haloperidol species and the distributions of each amongst bodily organs has been studied. 103mRh has a half-life of 56min and emits a gamma ray of energy 39.8keV, so the gamma-decay of the rhodium isotope should follow soon after the beta-decay of the ruthenium isotope. Beta- and gamma-emitting radionuclides used medically include 131I, 59Fe, and 47Ca, and 103mRh has been proposed for use in radiotherapy for small tumours.|$|E
25|$|The study's {{patients}} {{also showed}} {{significant improvement in}} the disease's symptoms; a later double-blind, randomized controlled trial also found ondansetron to significantly improve schizophrenia symptoms when used {{as an adjunct to}} <b>haloperidol,</b> and people taking both drugs experienced fewer of the adverse effects commonly associated with <b>haloperidol.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Haloperidol,</b> marketed {{under the}} trade name Haldol among others, {{is a typical}} {{antipsychotic}} medication. <b>Haloperidol</b> {{is used in the}} treatment of schizophrenia, tics in Tourette syndrome, mania in bipolar disorder, nausea and vomiting, delirium, agitation, acute psychosis, and hallucinations in alcohol withdrawal. It may be used by mouth, as an injection into a muscle, or intravenously. <b>Haloperidol</b> typically works within thirty to sixty minutes. A long-acting formulation may be used as an injection every four weeks in people with schizophrenia or related illnesses, who either forget or refuse to take the medication by mouth.|$|E
25|$|<b>Haloperidol,</b> {{when given}} to {{lactating}} women, {{is found in}} significant amounts in their milk. Breastfed children sometimes show extrapyramidal symptoms. If the use of <b>haloperidol</b> during lactation seems indicated, the benefit for the mother should clearly outweigh the risk for the child, or breastfeeding should be stopped.|$|E
25|$|<b>Haloperidol</b> is the INN, BAN, USAN, AAN {{approved}} name.|$|E
25|$|<b>Haloperidol,</b> {{and some}} other antipsychotics, {{have been shown to}} {{increase}} the binding capacity of the D2 receptor when used {{over long periods of time}} (i.e. increasing the number of such receptors). <b>Haloperidol</b> increased the number of binding sites by 98% above baseline in the worst cases, and yielded significant dyskinesia side effects.|$|E
25|$|Schizophrenia: {{antipsychotics}} such as <b>haloperidol,</b> clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone and quetiapine.|$|E
25|$|In {{patients}} with hyperthyreosis, {{the action of}} <b>haloperidol</b> is intensified and side effects are more likely.|$|E
25|$|A 2006 double-blind, {{randomized}} controlled trial indicated ondansetron may have {{value in the}} treatment of schizophrenia, as an adjunct to <b>haloperidol.</b> The study found the combination to significantly improve negative schizophrenia symptoms, and people taking both drugs experienced fewer of the adverse effects commonly associated with <b>haloperidol.</b> An earlier, smaller, open-label trial had found ondansetron to be useful in treating antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia in people with schizophrenia, and the study patients also showed significant improvement in the disease's symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Topical {{formulations}} of <b>haloperidol</b> {{should not be}} used as treatment for nausea because research does not indicate this therapy is more effective than alternatives.|$|E
25|$|<b>Haloperidol</b> was {{discovered}} in 1958 by Paul Janssen. It was made from pethidine (meperidine). It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. It is the most commonly used typical antipsychotic. The yearly cost of the typical dose of <b>haloperidol</b> is about 20 to 800 pounds (30 to 1,250 US dollars) in the United Kingdom. The cost in the United States is around 250 US dollars a year.|$|E
25|$|In general, the {{prognosis}} of overdose is good, and lasting damage is not known, provided the person has survived the initial phase. An overdose of <b>haloperidol</b> can be fatal.|$|E
25|$|<b>Haloperidol</b> was {{discovered}} by Paul Janssen. It was developed in 1958 at the Belgian company Janssen Pharmaceutica and submitted to the first of clinical trials in Belgium later that year.|$|E
25|$|In {{some cases}} antipsychotics, such as <b>haloperidol</b> {{may also be}} used. Older drugs such as {{paraldehyde}} and clomethiazole were formerly the traditional treatment but have now largely been superseded by the benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|<b>Haloperidol</b> is {{also used}} on many {{different}} kinds of animals. It appears to be particularly successful when given to birds, e.g., a parrot that will otherwise continuously pluck its feathers out.|$|E
25|$|<b>Haloperidol</b> was {{approved}} by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on April 12, 1967; it was later marketed in the U.S. and other countries under the brand name Haldol by McNeil Laboratories.|$|E
25|$|The {{bioavailability}} of oral <b>haloperidol</b> {{ranges from}} 60–70%. However, {{there is a}} wide variance in reported mean Tmax and T1/2 in different studies, ranging from 1.7 to 6.1 hours and 14.5 to 36.7 hours respectively.|$|E
25|$|A 2014 meta {{analysis}} of 9 published trials having minimum duration 6 months and median duration 52 weeks concluded that olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone had better effects on cognitive function than amisulpride and <b>haloperidol.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Haloperidol</b> was {{considered}} indispensable for treating psychiatric emergency situations, although the newer atypical drugs have gained {{greater role in}} a number of situations as outlined in a series of consensus reviews published between 2001 and 2005.|$|E
25|$|Macaque monkeys {{administered}} {{with the}} antipsychotics <b>haloperidol</b> and olanzapine over a 17–27 month period showed reduced brain volume. These results {{have not been}} observed in humans who also take the drug {{due to the lack}} of available data.|$|E
25|$|As <b>haloperidol</b> is a high-potency typical antipsychotic, {{it tends}} to produce {{significant}} extrapyramidal side effects. According to a 2013 meta-analysis of the comparative efficacy and tolerability of 15 antipsychotic drugs {{it was the most}} prone of the 15 for causing extrapyramidal side effects.|$|E
25|$|Antipsychotics, such as <b>haloperidol,</b> are {{sometimes}} used {{in addition to}} benzodiazepines to control agitation or psychosis. Antipsychotics may potentially worsen alcohol withdrawal as they lower the seizure threshold. Clozapine, olanzapine, or low-potency phenothiazines (such as chlorpromazine) are particularly risky; if used, extreme caution is required.|$|E
25|$|Aside from antipsychotics, {{there is}} scant {{reliable}} research {{about the effectiveness}} or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with ASD. Results of the handful of randomized controlled trials that have been performed suggest that risperidone, the SSRI fluvoxamine, and the typical antipsychotic <b>haloperidol</b> may be effective in reducing some behaviors, that <b>haloperidol</b> {{may be more effective}} than the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine, and that the opioid antagonist naltrexone hydrochloride is not effective. In small studies, memantine has been shown to significantly improve language function and social behavior in children with autism. Research is underway on the effects of memantine in adults with autism spectrum disorders. A person with ASD may respond atypically to medications and the medications can have adverse side effects.|$|E
25|$|Risperidone is {{effective}} in treating the acute exacerbations of schizophrenia. A 2013 study compared 15 antipsychotic drugs in treating schizophrenia. Risperidone was ranked fourth, 11% more effective than paliperidone (5th), 20-23% more effective than <b>haloperidol,</b> quetiapine, and aripiprazole, and 36% less effective than clozapine (1st).|$|E
25|$|In a 2013 {{study in}} a {{comparison}} of 15 antipsychotic drugs in effectiveness in treating schizophrenic symptoms, clozapine was ranked first, demonstrating very high effectiveness. 25% more effective than amisulpride (2nd), 33% more effective than olanzapine (3rd), and twice as effective as <b>haloperidol,</b> quetiapine, and aripiprazole.|$|E
25|$|Serotonin receptors: Its {{action at}} these receptors may be {{responsible}} for its lower extrapyramidal side effect liability (via the 5-HT2A/2C receptors) and improved negative symptom control compared to typical antipsychotics such as <b>haloperidol</b> for instance. Its antagonistic actions at the 5-HT2C receptor may account, in part, for its weight gain liability.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} high {{prevalence}} of social anxiety in Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. In a recent study, social phobia was diagnosed in 50% of Parkinson's disease patients. Other {{researchers have found}} social phobia symptoms in patients treated with dopamine antagonists like <b>haloperidol,</b> emphasizing the role of dopamine neurotransmission in social anxiety disorder.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{hypersensitivity}} to neuroleptics, preventing DLB {{patients from}} taking these medications is important. People with DLB {{are at risk}} for neuroleptic malignant syndrome, a life-threatening illness, because of their sensitivity to these medications, especially the older typical antipsychotics, such as <b>haloperidol.</b> Other medications, including medications for urinary incontinence and the antihistamine medication diphenhydramine (Benadryl), also may worsen confusion.|$|E
25|$|<b>Haloperidol</b> {{is heavily}} protein bound in human plasma, {{with a free}} {{fraction}} of only 7.5 to 11.6%. It is also extensively metabolized in the liver with only about 1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. The greatest proportion of the hepatic clearance is by glucuronidation, followed by reduction and CYP-mediated oxidation, primarily by CYP3A4.|$|E
25|$|Plasma {{levels of}} four to 25 micrograms per liter are {{required}} for therapeutic action. The determination of plasma levels {{can be used to}} calculate dose adjustments and to check compliance, particularly in long-term patients. Plasma levels in excess of the therapeutic range may lead to a higher incidence of side effects or even pose the risk of <b>haloperidol</b> intoxication.|$|E
