Here we intend to automate <b>Karyotyping</b> completely. <b>Karyotyping</b> is a common technique in cytogenetics, to classify human chromosomes into 24 classes. <b>Karyotyping</b> can be used to predict genetic disorders or abnormalities in pre-natal stage which may happen to occur in future generation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Couples with {{recurrent}} miscarriage (RM) have {{an increased}} risk of one of the partners carrying a structural chromosome abnormality. On the basis of four independent risk factors, an evidence-based model was developed, which allows limiting <b>karyotyping</b> to high-risk couples. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the level of adoption of selective <b>karyotyping,</b> its clinical consequences and the factors at the patient and hospital level that determine adoption. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed in nine Departments of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, the Netherlands, in 2006. Selective <b>karyotyping</b> was defined as offering <b>karyotyping</b> to high-risk couples and refraining from <b>karyotyping</b> in low-risk couples. Data were collected for risk factors as described in the model for selective <b>karyotyping,</b> cytogenetic results as a measure for clinical consequences, and information about determinants and costs. RESULTS: A total of 530 couples were included; 252 (48 %) high-risk couples and 278 (52 %) low-risk couples. Among the high-risk couples, 186 (74 %) were offered <b>karyotyping.</b> Although not advised, <b>karyotyping</b> was still performed in 198 (71 %) low-risk couples. Overall, selective <b>karyotyping</b> was offered to 50 % of the couples. The main determinants for adoption of the model were maternal age, obstetric history, treatment by specialists in RM and the number of patients per centre. If selective <b>karyotyping</b> was adopted adequately, a potential reduction of 34 % of all <b>karyotyping</b> tests performed is possible. CONCLUSION: Selective <b>karyotyping</b> is applied in only half of the couples with RM in daily practice. Implementation of selective <b>karyotyping</b> should be a topic of future research...|$|R
5|$|The <b>karyotype</b> {{generally}} includes 56chromosomes with a {{total of}} 54major arms (2n=56, FN=54) in specimens from both Bolivia and Brazil; a poorly prepared Paraguayan specimen seems to have a similar <b>karyotype.</b> In this <b>karyotype,</b> all autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) are acrocentric (with one arm so short as to be almost invisible). However, in two specimens from the Brazilian states of Tocantins and São Paulo, one pair of autosomes contains both an acrocentric and a metacentric chromosome (with two equally long arms), yielding an FN of 55. One arm of the metacentric chromosome consists entirely of heterochromatin. Apparently, a whole heterochromatic arm was added to this chromosome; cases of similar variation are known from the rodents Peromyscus, Clyomys, and Thaptomys. Both sex chromosomes are acrocentric, and X is larger than Y. In addition to heterochromatin near the centromere, the Y chromosome contains two large blocks of heterochromatin on its long arm. The <b>karyotype</b> is closely similar to that of Holochilus brasiliensis.|$|E

5|$|The <b>karyotype</b> in T.talamancae is variable. Samples {{from two}} {{different}} localities in Venezuela have 34chromosomes and a fundamental number of 64 chromosomal arms (2n=34, FN=64). Four specimens from another Venezuelan locality each have a different <b>karyotype,</b> {{with the number of}} chromosomes ranging from 40 to 42 and the fundamental number from 66 to perhaps 67. The autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) of the 2n=34 <b>karyotype</b> all have two major arms, but the 2n=40–42 karyotypes include several acrocentric autosomes, which only have one major arm. The 2n=34 <b>karyotype</b> includes two large submetacentric pairs, which have two long arms but one distinctly longer than the other, and one pair of subtelocentric chromosomes, with a long and a much shorter arm, but the 2n=40–42 karyotypes lack the submetacentrics and have another pair of subtelocentrics. Both Robertsonian translocations (fusions of the long arm of one chromosome with the long arm of another and the short arm of the one with the short arm of the other) and pericentric inversions (reversals of part of a chromosome that includes the centromere) are needed to explain {{the difference between the two}} groups.

5|$|The <b>karyotype</b> of Drymoreomys albimaculatus is 2n=62, FN=62: {{the animal}} has 62 chromosomes, and 29 pairs of autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) are {{acrocentric}} (with one arm so short {{as to be}} almost invisible) and one small pair is metacentric (with two equally long arms). Both sex chromosomes are submetacentric (with one arm noticeably longer than the other), and X is larger than Y. Blocks of heterochromatin are present on all autosomes and the long arm of Y.

40|$|Background: Conventional <b>karyotyping</b> {{has been}} a routine method to {{identify}} chromosome abnormalities in products of conception. However, this process is being transformed by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, which has advantages over <b>karyotyping,</b> including higher resolution and dispensing with cell culture. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the advantage of high-resolution SNP array in identifying genetic aberrations in products of conception. Methods: We consecutively collected 155 products of conception specimens, including 139 from first-trimester miscarriage and 16 from second-trimester miscarriage. SNP array was performed on these samples in parallel with G-banded <b>karyotyping.</b> Results: The test success rate was 98. 1 % (152 / 155) using SNP array, which was higher than that using <b>karyotyping</b> (133 / 155, 85. 8 %). It yielded a 63. 8 % (97 / 152) abnormality rate, and the frequency of various chromosome abnormalities was in agreement with other previous studies. The results between array and <b>karyotyping</b> demonstrated a 94. 0 % (125 / 133) concordance. SNP array obtained additional aberrations in 3. 8 % (5 / 133) of those cases unidentified by <b>karyotyping,</b> which included three cases with whole-genome uniparental disomy, one with pathogenic copy number variation, and one with del(4) (q 35. 1 q 35. 2) and dup(12) (q 24. 31 q 24. 33). However, chromosome translocations presented in two cases and tetraploidy presented in one case were detected by <b>karyotyping</b> instead of array. Additionally, two out of three cases with mosaic trisomy were revealed by array but recognized as pure trisomy by <b>karyotyping.</b> Conclusion: This study demonstrated that SNP array had certain advantages over G-banded <b>karyotyping,</b> including a higher success rate, additional detection of copy number variations and uniparental disomy, and improved sensitivity to mosaicism. Therefore, it would be an alternative method to <b>karyotyping</b> in clinical genetic practice...|$|R

40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					In 1952 Papanicolaou et al. first {{diagnosed}} and graded cervical carcinomas {{based on}} individual &# 8220;abnormal DNA contents&# 8221; and cellular phenotypes. Surprisingly current papilloma virus and mutation theories of carcinomas do not mention these individualities. The viral theory holds that randomly integrated, defective genomes of papilloma viruses, {{which are often}} untranscribed, cause cervical carcinomas with unknown cofactors 20 &# 8211; 50 years after infection. Virus-free carcinomas are attributed to mutations of a few tumor-suppressor genes, especially the p 53 gene. But the paradox of how a few mutations or latent defective viral DNAs would generate carcinomas with endless individual DNA contents, degrees of malignancies and cellular phenotypes is unsolved. Since speciation predicts individuality, we test here the theory that cancers are autonomous species with individual clonal <b>karyotypes</b> and phenotypes. This theory postulates that carcinogens induce aneuploidy. By unbalancing mitosis genes aneuploidy catalyzes chain reactions of karyotypic evolutions. Most such evolutions end with non-viable <b>karyotypes</b> but a few become new cancer <b>karyotypes.</b> Despite congenitally unbalanced mitosis genes cancer <b>karyotypes</b> are stabilized by clonal selections for cancer-specific autonomy. 				 				 					 						Results 					To test the prediction of the speciation theory that individual carcinomas have individual clonal <b>karyotypes</b> and phenotypes, we have analyzed here the phenotypes and <b>karyotypes</b> of nine cervical carcinomas. Seven of these contained papilloma virus sequences and two did not. We determined phenotypic individuality and clonality based on the morphology and sociology of carcinoma cells in vitro. Karyotypic individuality and clonality were determined by comparing all chromosomes of 20 <b>karyotypes</b> of carcinomas in three-dimensional arrays. Such arrays list chromosome numbers on the x-axis, chromosome copy numbers on the y-axis {{and the number of}} <b>karyotypes</b> arrayed on the z-axis. We found (1) individual clonal <b>karyotypes</b> and phenotypes in all nine carcinomas, but no virus-specific markers, (2) 1 -to- 1 variations between carcinoma-specific <b>karyotypes</b> and phenotypes, e. g. drug-resistance and cell morphology, (3) proportionality between the copy numbers of chromosomes and the copy numbers of hundreds of over- and under-expressed mRNAs, (4) evidence that tobacco-carcinogens induce cervical carcinomas via aneuploidy, consistent with the speciation theory. 				 				 					 						Conclusions 					Since the individual clonal <b>karyotypes</b> of nine carcinomas correlated and co-varied 1 -to- 1 with complex individual transcriptomes and phenotypes, we have classical genetic and functional transcriptomic evidence to conclude that these <b>karyotypes</b> encode carcinomas - much like the clonal <b>karyotypes</b> that encode conventional species. These individual <b>karyotypes</b> explain the individual &# 8220;DNA contents&# 8221;, the endless grades of malignancies and the complex individual transcriptomes and phenotypes of carcinomas...|$|R
