40|$|Tree {{growth is}} a {{fundamental}} indicator for conservation plans of Amazonian floodplain forests. In this study we use dendrochronology to analyze wood growth patterns of Tabebuia barbata and Vatairea guianensis, two tree species occurring in nutrient-rich white-water (várzea, Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve, MSDR) and nutrient-poor black-water (igapó, Amanã Sustainable Development Reserve, ASDR) floodplain forests of Central Amazonia. From 20 trees per species and floodplain system (total of 80 trees) growing under a similar flooding regime with a mean inundation height of about 4 m we measured diameter at breast height (dbh). We sampled two cores per tree with an increment corer {{at the height of}} dbh to determine wood density (WD), tree age and mean radial increment (MRI) rates. The wood samples were macroscopically analyzed. Both tree species show distinct annual tree rings characterized by marginal parenchyma tissues. MRI was measured by a digital measuring device and WD was determined by the ratio dry mass/fresh volume. MRI of both tree species was significantly higher in the várzea than in the igapó, which {{can be traced back to}} the contrasting nutrient status. WD showed no difference comparing both floodplain forest types. Tree ages of a species for the same diameter are more than twofold higher in the igapó than in the várzea. To insure a sustainable <b>harvest,</b> <b>felling</b> cycles in these forests should be adjusted according to rates of growth...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Peruvian anchovy {{industry}} grew at {{a compound}} rate of 42 percent between 1956 and 1965, making Peru the largest fish producer in the world. Between 1967 and 1971 annual catches averaged 10. 5 million metric tons. However, in 1972 the anomalous ocean current known as El Nino combined with over-exploitation to decimate the anchovy stock. Anchovy <b>harvests</b> <b>fell</b> by 55 percent in 1972 and another 51 percent in 1973. Despite {{the efforts of the}} Institutio del Mar del Peru, an incomplete understanding of the anchovy's behavior and imperfect management practices led to severe economic hardship. This paper presents an anchovy population dynamics model implemented as a computer simulation. It incorporates aspects of several general population models in the literature, the peculiar characteristics of the anchovy ecosystem, and Peru's specific economic needs. Our goal was to find the optimal management policy that can be practically implemented and to develop a methodology that can be applied to other situations. The model indicated that Peru should limit fishing to the springtime and use quotas that favor large modern purse seiners...|$|R

This tendency may have made it difficult for managers to predict the severe decline of the Chesapeake’s blue crab populations. Once considered an overwhelmingly abundant annoyance, the declining blue crab population is now the subject of anxiety among fishermen and managers. Over the decade between the mid-1990s to 2004, the population fell from 900 million to around 300 million, and <b>harvest</b> weight <b>fell</b> from 52,000 tons (115,000,000 lbs) to 28,000 tons (62,000,000 lbs).

Even more alarming, the number of females capable of reproducing, known as spawning age females, has plummeted 84% in just a few decades. Survival and addition of juveniles to the harvestable crab population is also low.

The Harvest System Assignment (HSA) model is {{used to evaluate the}} impact of a particular stand assignment on harvest system effectiveness and is designed to assist with harvest system assignment decisions. Four general harvesting systems: manual, mechanized, shovel and cut-to-length can be modeled to harvest timber, from standing trees to processed logs loaded on to trucks. Model testing showed that as terrain, tract and system characteristics changed, the effectiveness of each of the four systems varied. The most effective system can be determined for any combination of terrain, tract and system characteristics. The model output shows production potential as well as cost per unit, and identifies the causes and magnitude of inefficiency.

Soil moisture tension of the top soil dropped sharply during FC 4, from moderately dry to almost saturated (Fig.  3). All samples taken during FC 4 were brownish in colour.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{absolute}} dating techniques are now used in archaeology, from dendrochronology {{to a variety}} of luminescence and radiometric methods. 1 However, radiocarbon dating remains the most effective approach for the early historic periods. This is largely because of the levels of precision achievable, but also due to the diversity of materials that can be dated, and the ease with which radiocarbon dates can be connected to specific events in the past. Radiocarbon dating can be employed on all carbon-containing materials that are biogenic in origin. Common sample types include items fashioned from plant material, such as textiles and basketry, and the remains of animal and human tissue. Radiocarbon estimates denote the time elapsed since the antecedent organism ceased exchanging carbon with its environment. For human and animal remains this is invariably taken to be the time of death, and for plants it is most commonly the time at which the material was <b>harvested</b> or <b>felled.</b> With the advent of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) in the 1980 s, it became possible to conduct radiocarbon analysis on samples several orders of magnitude smaller than preceding techniques. 2 Typically, AMS can produce reliable dates on as little as 10 mg of plant material and just 250 mg of whole bone powder. As a result, AMS accounts for {{a large proportion of the}} dates made on archaeological samples. No form of radiocarbon dating can, however, provide direct estimates for the age of lithic or ceramic artefacts. The principle difficulty lies in relating any datable material obtained to the manufacture or use of the object in question. In fact, carbonaceous inclusions in such materials are likely to be of geological age, and therefore beyond the 50, 000 year detection limit of the technique. Consequently, there remains a disjunction between radiocarbon results and dates based on ceramic seriation. One possibility at bridging this divide comes from the radiocarbon dating of organic residues adhered to specific ceramic types. This prospect was investigated for Early Egypt by an interdisciplinary research team from the University of Oxford, University College London and Cranfield University.

25|$|Extensive logging of redwoods {{began in}} the early nineteenth century. The trees were felled by ax and saw onto beds of tree limbs and shrubs to cushion their fall. Stripped of their bark, the logs were transported to mills or {{waterways}} by oxen or horse. Loggers then burned the accumulated tree limbs, shrubs, and bark. The repeated fires favored secondary forests of primarily redwoods as redwood seedlings sprout readily in burned areas. The introduction of steam engines allowed logs to be dragged through long skid trails to nearby railroads, furthering the reach of loggers beyond the land nearby rivers previously used to transport trees. This method of harvesting, however, disturbed large amounts of soil, producing secondary-growth forests of species other than redwood such as Douglas-fir, grand fir, and western hemlock. After World War II, trucks and tractors gradually replaced steam engines, giving rise to two harvesting approaches: clearcutting and selection <b>harvesting.</b> Clearcutting involved <b>felling</b> all the trees in a particular area and was encouraged by tax law which exempted all standing timber from taxation if 70% of trees in the area were harvested. Selection logging, by contrast, called for the removal 25% to 50% of mature trees in the hopes that the remaining trees would allow for future growth and reseeding. This method, however, encouraged growth of other tree species, converting redwood forests into mixed forests of redwood, grand fir, Sitka spruce, and western hemlock. Moreover, the trees left standing were often felled by windthrow; that is, they were often blown over by the wind.|$|R
