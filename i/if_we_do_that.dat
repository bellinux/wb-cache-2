500|$|Williams felt music lacked energy, citing Limp Bizkit's [...] "Nookie" [...] as {{the last}} {{energetic}} record. Williams suggested his engineer, Andrew Coleman, to [...] "put the drums and bass on the right, keys in the middle, and the mothafucking guitar and backgrounds on the left". Coleman denied his request, saying, [...] "those systems were different back then. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> you'll be in a club and all you will hear {{on one side of}} the club is drums and on the other side, just chords." ...|$|E

[...] "Not a bit of it. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> we are bound to see {{something}} or hear something that will make us hesitate and consider, and <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> away goes our enthusiasm and our rapture. I say, telegraph this minute and say we'll take the house, and send a letter by the next mail with a postal order in it, to secure the place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{thinking}} of that. But, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> we had better wait until to-morrow morning. You can't see much in the dark." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It can't be helped," [...] {{answered}} Snap. [...] "We can't {{expect to}} bring down something every time <b>we</b> go out. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> {{there would be no}} fun in hunting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Bluff Harry is right, Ben; however, it ain't no use having words atween friends. We {{have got}} to stick {{together}} here, and <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can clear this camp out.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It's {{cheaper to}} live with you, granddad," [...] laughed Mrs. Joshua. [...] "Josh says <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> he has more money to buy cows." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{that is the}} plan, chief. Well, if we {{get down}} there we shall have to take our shovels and clear the snow {{off some of the}} narrow ledges. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> we can lead one of the horses down to pack the poles up here." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{the lesson}} was this: {{when we are}} puzzling our brains with plans to help {{ourselves}} out of our troubles, let us always stop a moment in our planning, and try to think {{if there is not}} some simple way out of the difficulty, which shall be in every respect perfectly right. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> we shall probably find the way, and also find it much more satisfactory as well as easier than any of our ingenious and elaborate plans.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wish we had}} a flag," [...] said Dick. [...] "Here is a tall tree. We could chop {{away the}} top {{branches}} and hang up a signal of distress. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>that,</b> perhaps some ship would come this way and rescue us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [In broken tones.] Don't you {{understand}} that we could never respect ourselves again <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> poor creature such a fearful wrong? She would be always between us with her tears and her sorrows. I tell you I couldn't bear it. Have mercy on me--if you love me at all.|$|R
6000|$|... "Attick is a fool!" [...] said Muskrat, contemptuously. [...] "Does he {{not know}} that no more goods would evermore be sent into our lands <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>that,</b> and also that the pale-faces always hunt murderers to death? No; if that had been possible, or wise, Muskrat {{would have done it}} himself long ago." ...|$|R
60|$|If we shut {{our hearts}} to those good feelings, {{they will go}} away and leave us. And if they do, we shall neither respect our neighbours, nor respect ourselves. We shall see no good in our neighbours, but become scornful and {{suspicious}} to them; and <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> we shall soon see no good in ourselves. We shall become discontented with ourselves, more and more given up to angry thoughts and mean ways, which we hate and despise, all the while that we go on in them.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is an all-fired nasty-looking place," [...] Jerry said; [...] "but I {{have heard}} {{men who had}} been in the north talk about rapids they had gone through, and from what they said about them they must have been worse than this. We have got to keep as near the side as we can; the waves ain't as high there as they are in the middle, and we have got to keep the boat's head straight, and to paddle all we know. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> I reckon the canoes will go through." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't {{answer for}} that, Ben; {{it is early}} in the day yet, and there is no saying how the wind may be blowing before to-morrow morning. Anyhow, now we have time we may as well get some of those bundles of bushes that we brought down, and pile them so as to thicken the shelter of these bushes and lighten it a bit. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> and hang a couple of {{blankets}} inside of them, it will give us a good shelter even if the wind works round, and will help to keep us warm. For though we haven't got wind or snow in here, we have got cold." ...|$|E

5000|$|To prevent {{more federal}} deficits, Buckley said: [...] "I like tax cuts {{but only when}} they're matched with {{spending}} cuts, and I've proposed a 25% across-the-board cut in spending apart from Social Security. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> right now it would balance the budget, allow the Social Security surplus to be funded, and provide for tax cuts." [...] Buckley has also called for a referendum on whether to increase Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax (FICA).|$|R
5000|$|The team thrilled spectators with low-flying {{maneuvers}} {{performed in}} tight formations, and (according to Voris) by [...] "keeping something {{in front of}} the crowds at all times. My objective was to beat the Army Air Corps. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>that,</b> we'd get all the other side issues. I felt that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> weren't the best, it would be my naval career." [...] The Blue Angels' first public demonstration also netted the team its first trophy, which sits on display at the team's current home at NAS Pensacola.|$|R
6000|$|... "It grieves me to {{find you}} in this {{negative}} state," [...] she returned, [...] "and I can only {{hope and pray that}} you will not always continue in it. You do not deny the truth of Christianity, you say; but tell me, putting aside all that men say for and against our holy faith, and the arguments that have pulled you this way and that, is there not something in your own soul that tells you that you are not here by chance, that there is an Unseen Power that gave us life, and that it is good for us, even here in this short existence, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> which is pleasing to Him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{will put}} you down, Wilfrid," [...] Mr. Atherton said quietly; [...] "that {{will give me}} time to cool down a bit before they arrive. They could not have come up at {{a better place for}} us. It is no use our trying to hide, they would track us directly. We must make a stand at the mouth of this defile. It is a good place for defence, and {{if it were not for}} this rascally bush we should have no {{difficulty}} in keeping them off. Even as it is I think we can make a good fight of it. Now, Mrs. Renshaw, will you and Mrs. Sampson and the child go a little way in and sit down. I have no doubt we shall be able to beat these fellows back, and <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> we can hope to make the rest of our journey without further molestation." ...|$|E
60|$|Oh, my friends, {{consider}} this. We {{were not}} put {{into this world}} to get pleasant things; and we shall not be put into the next world, {{as it seems to}} me, to get pleasant things. We were put into this world to do God's will. And we shall be put (I believe) into the next world for the very same purpose--to do God's will; and <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> we shall find pleasure enough in doing it. I do not doubt that in the next world all manner of harmless pleasure will come to us likewise; because that will be, we hope, a perfect and a just world, not a piecemeal, confused, often unjust world, like this: but pleasant things will come to us in the next life, only in proportion as we shall be doing God's will in the next life; and we shall be happy and blessed, only because we shall be living that eternal life of which I have been preaching to you all along, the life which Christ lives and has lived and will live for ever, saying to the Eternal Father--I come to do thy will--not my will but thine be done.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't want to. I {{know how}} you feel about it, Mistress Blythe--just as I feel meself. But it ain't our {{feelings}} we have to steer by through life--no, no, we'd make shipwreck mighty often <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>that.</b> There's only the one safe compass and we've got to set our course by that--what it's right to do. I agree with the doctor. If there's a chance for Dick, Leslie should be told of it. There's no two sides to that, in my opinion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I say, Robin, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> find <b>that</b> gal, you won't {{split on}} me, eh? You won't tell 'er who I am or where I is? You won't wictimise your old friend?" ...|$|R

60|$|God {{grant that}} when that lesson {{is sent to}} us we may learn it. Learn it, perhaps, at once, and in a moment, we cannot. Weak flesh and blood cannot enter into the kingdom of God, and see that he is ruling us, and all things, in love and justice; and our eyes are, as it were, dimmed with our tears, so that we cannot see God's {{handwriting}} upon the wall against us. But at length, when the first burst of sorrow is past, we may learn it; and, like righteous Job, justify God; saying,--The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, blessed be {{the name of the}} Lord. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> and give God the glory, it may be with us, after all, as it was with Job, when God gave him back sevenfold for all that he had taken away, wealth and prosperity, sons and daughters. For God doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men out of spite. His punishments are not revenge, but correction; and, as a father, he chastises his children, not to harm, but to bless them.|$|E
6000|$|Is {{not then}} the Old Testament {{contrary}} to the New, if the Old Testament teaches men to look for their reward in this life, and the New Testament in the next? No, it is not, my friends. And I think we shall {{see that it is}} not, and why it is not, if we will look honestly at this very important text. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> we shall see that what St. Peter meant-- what the VII. Article means is the only meaning which will make sense of either one or the other; is simply this--that what causes a man to enjoy this life, is the same that will cause him to enjoy the life to come. [...] That what will bring a blessing on him in this life, will bring a blessing on him in the life to come. That what blessed the old Jews, will bless us Christians. That if we refrain our tongue from evil, and our lips from speaking deceit; it we avoid evil and do good; if we seek peace and follow earnestly after it; then shall we enjoy life, and see good days, and inherit a blessing; whether in this life or in the life to come.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{a bit of}} it. Sophie and Aunt Zeruah have fixed their throne up in our bedroom, {{and there}} they sit all day long, except at calling-hours, and then Sophie dresses herself and comes down. Aunt Zeruah insists upon it that the way {{is to put the}} whole house in order, and shut all the blinds, and sit in your bedroom, and then, she says, nothing gets out of place; and she tells poor Sophie the most hocus-pocus stories about her grandmothers and aunts, who always kept {{everything}} in their houses so that they could go and lay their hands on it in the darkest night. I'll bet they could in our house. From end to end it is kept looking as if we had shut it up and gone to Europe,--not a book, not a paper, not a glove, or any trace of a human being in sight; the piano shut tight, the bookcases shut and locked, the engravings locked up, all the drawers and closets locked. Why, if I want to take a fellow into the library, in the first place it smells like a vault, and I have to unbarricade windows, and unlock and rummage for half an hour before I can get at anything; and I know Aunt Zeruah is standing tiptoe at the door, ready to whip everything back and lock up again. A fellow can't be social, or take any comfort in showing his books and pictures that way. Then there's our great, light dining-room, with its sunny south windows,--Aunt Zeruah got us out of that early in April, because she said the flies would speck the frescoes and get into the china-closet, and we have been eating in a little dingy den, with a window looking out on a back alley, ever since; and Aunt Zeruah says that now the dining-room is always in perfect order, and that it is such a care off Sophie's mind that I ought to be willing to eat down cellar {{to the end of the}} chapter. Now, you see, Chris, my position is a delicate one, because Sophie's folks all agree that, if there is anything in creation that is ignorant and dreadful and mustn't be allowed his way anywhere, it's 'a man.' Why, you'd think, to hear Aunt Zeruah talk, that we were all like bulls in a china-shop, ready to toss and tear and rend, if we are not kept down cellar and chained; and she worries Sophie, and Sophie's mother comes in and worries, and if I try to get anything done differently Sophie cries, and says she don't know what to do, and so I give it up. Now, if I want to ask a few of our set in sociably to dinner, I can't have them where we eat down cellar,--oh, that would never do! Aunt Zeruah and Sophie's mother and the whole family would think the family honor was forever ruined and undone. We mustn't ask them unless we open the dining-room, and have out all the best china, and get the silver home from the bank; and <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> Aunt Zeruah doesn't sleep for a week beforehand, getting ready for it, and for a week after, getting things put away; and then she tells me that, in Sophie's delicate state, it really is abominable for me to increase her cares, and so I invite fellows to dine with me at Delmonico's, and then Sophie cries, and Sophie's mother says it doesn't look respectable for a family man to be dining at public places; but, hang it, a fellow wants a home somewhere!" ...|$|E
