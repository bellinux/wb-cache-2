500|$|Hardly <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was doing... I {{sat down}} and started to work out an agonized craving for the sun and a furious revolt against that terrible cheerless, heartless food by writing down {{descriptions}} of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cooking. Even to write words like apricot, olives and butter, rice and lemons, oil and almonds, produced assuagement. Later I {{came to realize that}} in the England of 1947, those were dirty words I was putting down.|$|E
500|$|Adamle was {{eligible}} {{to play for}} the Buckeyes again in 1947, but decided to leave school and join the Cleveland Browns of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Adamle had been selected with the 105th pick in the 1947 NFL Draft by the Chicago Bears, and he told Cleveland head coach Paul Brown, who coached Ohio State's varsity team between 1941 and 1943, that he would join the Bears if the Browns did not sign him. [...] "I would be a pretty sick fellow today, <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> do about Tony, if George Halas had gotten him," [...] Brown said before the season began.|$|E
500|$|After {{playing at}} a few gigs with Deftones in California, United States, Korn {{went back to the}} studio to start {{recording}} Life Is Peachy in April 1996. Korn asked Ross Robinson to produce, and wanted to begin recording at Indigo Ranch, mostly because their first album had been recorded there and was a success. Authors Jason Arnopp and Doug Small, insisted the album was rushed when it was put together. Silveria explained, [...] "We went in really fresh, and we wanted to get it done quickly to capture that moment. So it was probably about sixty percent <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was going to play and forty percent just playing whatever came to mind at that moment, It ended up really good, and it has a kind of energy I probably wouldn't have gotten if I'd worked everything out beforehand." [...] Korn's bassist Reginald [...] "Fieldy" [...] Arvizu said, [...] "We wanted that same energy and inspiration we found up in the Malibu Hills." ...|$|E

2500|$|At the inter-Allied {{conference at}} Boulogne (20 October) Asquith {{supported}} Robertson in opposing major offensives at Salonika, although Britain {{had to agree}} to send a second British division, rather than be the only Ally not to send reinforcements. Robertson wrote to Repington (31 October 1916) “If I were not in my present position I daresay I could find half a dozen different ways of rapidly winning this war. Being in the position I am and <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> know I find it not so easy...”.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his time}} in the Senate, Edwards co-sponsored 203 bills. Among them was Lieberman's 2002 Iraq War Resolution (S.J.Res.46), which he co-sponsored along with 15 other senators, but which did not go to a vote. He voted for {{replacement}} resolution (H.J Res. 114) in the full Senate to authorize {{the use of military force}} against Iraq, which passed by a vote of 77 to 23, On October 10, 2002, he stated that: [...] He defended his vote on an October 10, 2004, appearance on Meet the Press, saying [...] "I would have voted for the resolution <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> know today, because it was the right thing to do to give the president the authority to confront Saddam Hussein...I think Saddam Hussein was a very serious threat. I stand by that, and that's why [...] stand behind our vote on the resolution". However, he subsequently changed his mind about the war and apologized for that military authorization vote. Edwards also voted in favor of the Patriot Act.|$|E
2500|$|Castro, on {{the other}} hand, was {{convinced}} that an invasion of Cuba was soon at hand, and on October 26, he sent a telegram to Khrushchev that appeared {{to call for a}} pre-emptive nuclear strike on the US in case of attack. However, in a 2010 interview, Castro expressed regret about his earlier stance on first use: [...] "After I've seen what I've seen, and <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> know now, it wasn't worth it at all." [...] Castro also ordered all anti-aircraft weapons in Cuba to fire on any US aircraft: the orders had been to fire only on groups of two or more. At 6:00am EDT on October 27, the CIA delivered a memo reporting that three of the four missile sites at San Cristobal and the two sites at Sagua la Grande appeared to be fully operational. It also noted that the Cuban military continued to organize for action but was under order not to initiate action unless attacked.|$|E

2500|$|That bad bowling on that Sunday, that's {{the only}} regret I have in cricket, and I'm sorry I can't have it over again, because <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> could do, in my opinion, that's what hurts {{most of all}} [...] [...] Sometimes it haunts me, but anyway, that's {{part and parcel of}} life, and you cop it sweet. Anyone who asks me , that's no problem, it brings back bad memories, but you cop it sweet and anyone decent you respond by telling them what you think, and everyone's {{entitled}} to ask in that regard... The only person who gave me some moral support, after I'd bowled the six overs, was Keith Stackpole, he was vice-captain. He ran up and said, 'It's not easy first-up, 'Wok'. I thought it was good of him to say that. Unfortunately I had one opportunity and I botched it; I lacked disposition on the day and after that I lost my confidence.|$|E
2500|$|Duff McKagan {{praised the}} album, saying that [...] "Axl sounds amazing" [...] and [...] "I think Axl's finally made the record {{he always wanted}} to". Slash reacted {{positively}} to the title track, stating [...] "That sounds cool. It's good to hear Axl's voice again, y'know?" [...] When the album was released, Slash responded by saying [...] "It's a really good record. It's {{very different from what}} the original Guns N' Roses sounded like, but it's a great statement by Axl... It's a record that the original Guns N' Roses could never possibly make. And {{at the same time it}} just shows you how brilliant Axl is." [...] In a later interview, Slash stated the album was [...] "exactly what I thought it would sound like," [...] with many synthesizers and digital augmentations. Izzy Stradlin, soon after the album was released, said [...] "I have listened to some tracks off the record and I enjoyed them" [...] and [...] "I like what I've heard." [...] Steven Adler said he [...] "didn't like the album, not one bit." [...] Gilby Clarke stated [...] "I think it's a really good record – I honestly do. I think it's a great record... <b>Knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> know what direction he wanted to take the band, I think he hit the nail on the head; I think he did a great job" [...] Matt Sorum called the album a 'toe-tapper'. Early Guns N' Roses guitarist Tracii Guns said he thought the album was [...] "over-indulgent, sterile and not that exciting." ...|$|E

60|$|When I reached Miss Heda she was {{collecting}} half-opened monthly roses {{from the}} hedge, {{and not quite}} <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> to say <b>I</b> made the appropriate quotation. At least it was appropriate to my thought, and, from her answer, to hers also.|$|R

60|$|The morning {{found me}} with my pen in my hand, confronting the serious {{responsibility}} of writing to the Princess, and not <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> to say. <b>I</b> had already torn up two letters, when Uncle David presented himself with a message from his niece.

6000|$|She {{did not say}} no, {{and long}} after the door had closed upon him she {{remained}} fixed in thought. 'How can he be blamed for his manner,' she said, 'after <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> did!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor have I {{any desire}} to do you an injury, Dr. Sterndale. Surely the clearest proof of it is that, <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> know, I have sent for you {{and not for the}} police." ...|$|E

6000|$|Now we were face to face. Our eyes met, and oh! hers {{were full}} of love and trust. They dazzled and bewildered me.

60|$|In {{the midst}} of my doleful dumps, some one tapped me on the shoulder, and looking up I saw a couple of rough sturdy fellows {{standing}} behind me.

6000|$|I did so, not <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> djinns <b>I</b> should evoke; and {{the result}} was such an apology as one might make who had spent a night on the rack.

Until Mr. Shaynor came down from the North his assistants had by no means agreed with Mr. Cashell.
