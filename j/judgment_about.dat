5|$|In 1994 Tony Hall, {{the head}} of the BBC's News and Current Affairs, argued that the {{restrictions}} did not allow viewers to make a proper <b>judgment</b> <b>about</b> those subject to the rules, as the subtle changes to their voices could not be heard. In particular he cited the example of the appearance of Gerry Adams on the BBC's On the Record in September 1993, in which he spoke about the prospect of peace in Northern Ireland. Hall said Adams was nervous and defensive throughout the interview as the presenter, Sheena McDonald, argued that peace could not be achieved while the IRA continued its violent stance, but that viewers were unaware of these aspects of the discussion. He also said that some countries, such as India and Egypt, had quoted the restrictions to BBC journalists who complained about the over use of censorship by authorities in those countries. Additionally Hall argued that Sinn Féin and the IRA had manipulated the ban by using it as an excuse to decline interviews.|$|E

40|$|Past {{studies have}} {{revealed}} that encountering negative events interferes with cognitive processing of subsequent stimuli. The present study investigates whether negative events affect semantic and perceptual processing differently. Presentation of negative pictures produced slower reaction times than neutral or positive pictures in tasks that require semantic processing, such as natural or man-made <b>judgments</b> <b>about</b> drawings of objects, commonness <b>judgments</b> <b>about</b> objects, and categorical <b>judgments</b> <b>about</b> pairs of words. In contrast, negative picture presentation did not slow down judgments in subsequent perceptual processing (e. g., color <b>judgments</b> <b>about</b> words, size <b>judgments</b> <b>about</b> objects). The subjective arousal level of negative pictures did not modulate the interference effects on semantic or perceptual processing. These findings indicate that encountering negative emotional events interferes with semantic processing of subsequent stimuli more strongly than perceptual processing, and that not all types of subsequent cognitive processing are impaired by negative events...|$|R

Using a minimal group paradigm, participants read either positive or negative trait-relevant behaviors performed by group members. They then were asked to make <b>judgments</b> <b>about</b> the group’s trait characteristics. Results demonstrated that, for groups described positively, <b>judgments</b> <b>about</b> the out-group but not the in-group were accomplished by retrieving from memory specific behaviors performed by group mem-bers. In contrast, for groups described negatively, <b>judgments</b> <b>about</b> the in-group but not the out-group were accomplished by retrieving specific behaviors performed by group mem-bers. These results suggest that basic differences in the way <b>judgments</b> <b>about</b> in-groups and out-groups are made contribute to the establishment and perpetuation of intergroup bias by decreasing the stability of negative in-group and positive out-group impressions and increasing the stability of positive in-group and negative out-group impressions. r 199...|$|R

Third, Michigan's system did not entirely lack mechanisms for considering the individual circumstances of a particular defendant. Prosecutors have discretion in bringing charges, the governor has the power to grant clemency post hoc, and the legislature has the power to retroactively modify the sentence for all persons convicted of Harmelin's crime.|$|E
40|$|Psychopathy is a {{personality}} variable associated with persistent immoral behaviors. Despite this, attempts to link moral reasoning deficits to psychopathic traits have yielded mixed results with many findings supporting intact moral reasoning in individuals with psychopathic traits. Abundant {{evidence shows that}} psychopathy impairs responses to others' emotional distress. However, most studies of morality and psychopathy focus on <b>judgments</b> <b>about</b> causing others physical harm. Results of such studies may be inconsistent because physical harm is an imperfect proxy for emotional distress. No previous paradigm has explicitly separated <b>judgments</b> <b>about</b> physical harm and emotional distress and assessed how psychopathy affects each type of judgment. In three studies we found that psychopathy impairs <b>judgments</b> <b>about</b> causing others emotional distress (specifically fear) but minimally affects <b>judgments</b> <b>about</b> causing physical harm and that <b>judgments</b> <b>about</b> causing fear predict instrumental aggression in psychopathy. These {{findings are consistent with}} reports linking psychopathy to insensitivity to others' fear, and suggest that sensitivity to others' fear may play a fundamental role in the types of moral decision-making impaired by psychopathy...|$|R

25|$|Historians {{disagree}} {{on the details of}} Reynolds' death, including the specific time (either 10:15a.m. or 10:4010:50a.m.), the exact location (on East McPherson Ridge, near the 2nd Wisconsin Infantry, or West McPherson Ridge, near the 19th Indiana), and the source of the bullet (a Confederate infantryman, a Confederate sharpshooter, or friendly fire). One primary source was Sergeant Charles Henry Veil, his orderly and unit Color Guard, who described the events in a letter in 1864 and then contradicted some of the details in another letter 45 years later. A letter from Reynolds' sister, Jennie, stated that the wound had a downward trajectory from the neck, implying that he was shot from above, presumably a sharpshooter in a tree or barn. Historians Bruce Catton and Glenn Tucker make firm assertions that a sharpshooter was responsible; Stephen Sears credits volley fire from the 7th Tennessee against the 2nd Wisconsin; Edwin Coddington cites the sister's letter and finds the sharpshooter theory to be partly credible, but leans towards Sears' conclusion; Harry W. Pfanz agrees that the location was behind the 2nd Wisconsin, but makes no <b>judgment</b> <b>about</b> the source of the fire. Steve Sanders, writing in Gettysburg magazine, suggested the possibility of friendly fire based on some accounts, and concludes that it is as equally likely as enemy fire.|$|E
25|$|Taylor {{built upon}} Heidegger’s work when he {{described}} {{human beings as}} constantly being engaged {{in the process of}} interpreting and re-interpreting themselves using their own unique perspectives based on their thoughts, feelings, and desires. According to Taylor, human beings make sense of their feelings by seeing “them as embodying a <b>judgment</b> <b>about</b> the object they bear on: ‘To experience fear is to experience some object as terrifying or dangerous; to experience shame is to experience some objects as shameful or humiliating” (Taylor: 47, as cited in Richardson et al.: 216). What Taylor is getting at is that Dasein's emotions provides him with a sense of situational understanding and are “affective modes of awareness” (as cited in Richardson et al.: 216). Psychologists practicing ontological hermeneutics in counseling write that this standpoint is in stark contrast to mainstream cognitive approaches which hold that emotions are merely byproducts of our cognitive awareness. Instead, Taylor is taking the cognitive-affective relation out of a linear mode of understanding (thoughts lead to emotions) and placing it phenomenologically in non-linear fashion (thoughts=emotions=interpreted knowledge, meaning they don’t necessarily happen in sequence). This affective mode of awareness serves as more than just knowledge about the world and/or about Dasein, where upon Taylor takes the theory to its logical conclusion: if Dasein's emotions reflect his judgments about the world around him, they also show what is important to him and why. For example, to experience love for another person subjectively informs Dasein that the relationship with that person is important to him. It is through such subjective experience that Dasein's world and his experiences become meaningful to him. Richardson et al. say that this contrast between Taylor’s theory and mainstream approaches has profound implications for conceptualizing human suffering as therapists. Taylor's argument is that emotions are not the mere result of cognitive processes, but subjective judgments about how human beings view their world around them and what is important to them, then it begs questions like what is human suffering, what causes human suffering, is all suffering bad, etc. Taylor, drawing on ontological hermeneutics, takes the phenomenon of human suffering out of the objective, scientific realm (where mainstream psychotherapy has currently placed it) and restores it to the subjective realm of embodied experience. Proponents of ontological hermeneutics state that this is where it rightfully belongs.|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} are conducted in which MBA students make <b>judgments</b> <b>about</b> a company's future performance and management's reputation {{after the company}} reports poor financial results. Information about the CEO's pre-existing reputation is manipulated at three levels (favorable, unfavorable, or none) and the plausibility of management's explanation is manipulated at two levels (plausible or implausible). Generally, {{the results indicate that}} management's explanations influence investors' judgments of the company's future performance and that <b>judgments</b> <b>about</b> management were jointly influenced by both manipulated factors. Specifically, our results indicate that a pre-existing favorable management reputation is an enduring trait that is not damaged even when management offers an implausible explanation. Our results are consistent with Mercer (2004) but inconsistent with other research ([Janoff-Bulman, 1992] and [Meyerson et al., 1996]) suggesting that a good reputation is easily lost. Our results also indicate that offering a plausible explanation improves the reputation of managers with an unfavorable reputation. We also find that <b>judgments</b> <b>about</b> management's intentions for explaining poor performance represent a partial mediator for <b>judgments</b> <b>about</b> management's reputation. Finally, we provide evidence that <b>judgments</b> <b>about</b> the company's future performance and management's reputation are consequential in that they are associated with investors' equity judgments. ...|$|R

40|$|Social {{projection}} is {{the tendency}} to expect similarities between oneself and others. A {{review of the literature}} and a meta-analysis reveal that projection is stronger when people make <b>judgments</b> <b>about</b> ingroups than when they make <b>judgments</b> <b>about</b> outgroups. Analysis of moderator variables further reveals that ingroup projection is stronger for laboratory groups than for real social categories.

Outgroup projection is positive, but small in size. Together, these findings support the view that projection can serve as an egocentric heuristic for inductive reasoning. The greater strength of ingroup projection can con-tribute to ingroup-favoritism, perceptions of ingroup homogeneity, and cooperation with ingroup members.
