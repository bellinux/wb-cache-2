5|$|The {{nature of}} the product {{and the manner in}} which it is {{processed}} led to concerns that it might be a risk to human health, despite the fact that there have been no reported cases of <b>foodborne</b> illnesses due to consumption of the product. Among consumers, media reporting significantly reduced its acceptance as an additive to ground beef.|$|E
5|$|If {{bacteria}} form a parasitic {{association with}} other organisms, they are classed as pathogens. Pathogenic bacteria {{are a major}} cause of human death and disease and cause infections such as tetanus, typhoid fever, diphtheria, syphilis, cholera, <b>foodborne</b> illness, leprosy and tuberculosis. A pathogenic cause for a known medical disease may only be discovered many years after, {{as was the case with}} Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcer disease. Bacterial diseases are also important in agriculture, with bacteria causing leaf spot, fire blight and wilts in plants, as well as Johne's disease, mastitis, salmonella and anthrax in farm animals.|$|E
25|$|A main aim of {{this study}} was to compare if <b>foodborne</b> illness {{incidence}} had increased over time. In this study, similar methods of assessment were applied to data from circa 2000, which showed that the rate of <b>foodborne</b> gastroenteritis had not changed significantly over time. Two key estimates were the total number of gastroenteritis episodes each year, and the proportion considered <b>foodborne.</b> In circa 2010, it was estimated that 25% of all episodes of gastroenteritis were <b>foodborne.</b> By applying this proportion of episodes due to food to the incidence of gastroenteritis circa 2000, there were an estimated 4.3 million (90% CrI: 2.2–7.3 million) episodes of <b>foodborne</b> gastroenteritis circa 2000, although credible intervals overlap with 2010. Taking into account changes in population size, applying these equivalent methods suggests a 17% decrease in the rate of <b>foodborne</b> gastroenteritis between 2000 and 2010, with considerable overlap of the 90% credible intervals.|$|E
25|$|Globally, infants are a {{population}} that are especially vulnerable to <b>foodborne</b> disease. The World Health Organization has issued recommendations for the preparation, use and storage of prepared formulas. Breastfeeding remains the best preventative measure for protection of <b>foodborne</b> infections in infants.|$|E
25|$|Most <b>foodborne</b> parasites are zoonoses.|$|E
25|$|The main causes were Norovirus, {{pathogenic}} Escherichia coli, Campylobacter spp. and non-typhoidal Salmonella spp., {{although the}} causes of approximately 80% of illnesses were unknown. Approximately 25% (90% CrI: 13%–42%) of the 15.9 million episodes of gastroenteritis that occur in Australia were estimated to be transmitted by contaminated food. This equates {{to an average of}} approximately one episode of <b>foodborne</b> gastroenteritis every five years per person. Data on the number of hospitalisations and deaths represent the occurrence of serious <b>foodborne</b> illness. Including gastroenteritis, non-gastroenteritis and sequelae, there were an estimated annual 31,920 (90% CrI: 29,500–35,500) hospitalisations due to <b>foodborne</b> illness and 86 (90% CrI: 70–105) deaths due to <b>foodborne</b> illness circa 2010. This study concludes that these rates are similar to recent estimates in the US and Canada.|$|E
25|$|Escherichia coli O157:H7, a <b>foodborne</b> {{pathogen}} {{associated with}} large-scale food recalls.|$|E
25|$|The most {{significant}} zoonotic pathogens causing <b>foodborne</b> diseases are , Campylobacter, Caliciviridae, and Salmonella.|$|E
25|$|Viral infections make up {{perhaps one}} third of cases of food {{poisoning}} in developed countries. In the US, more than 50% of cases are viral and noroviruses {{are the most common}} <b>foodborne</b> illness, causing 57% of outbreaks in 2004. <b>Foodborne</b> viral infection are usually of intermediate (1–3 days) incubation period, causing illnesses which are self-limited in otherwise healthy individuals; they are similar to the bacterial forms described above.|$|E
25|$|The long {{incubation}} period of many <b>foodborne</b> illnesses tends to cause sufferers to attribute their symptoms to gastroenteritis.|$|E
25|$|None of the US Department of Health and Human Services targets {{regarding}} {{incidence of}} <b>foodborne</b> infections were reached in 2007.|$|E
25|$|In {{the food}} {{handling}} and processing industry, especially for food storage systems and food preparation. Maintaining the correct temperature {{is critical to}} prevent <b>foodborne</b> illness.|$|E
25|$|Food {{intolerance}} reactions {{can include}} pharmacologic, metabolic, and gastro-intestinal responses to foods or food compounds. Food intolerance {{does not include}} either psychological responses or <b>foodborne</b> illness.|$|E
25|$|All cut, peeled, or cooked {{fruits and}} {{vegetables}} should be refrigerated within two hours. After a certain time, harmful bacteria may grow on them and {{increase the risk of}} <b>foodborne</b> illness.|$|E
25|$|Various {{pathogens}} {{can cause}} gastroenteritis an {{inflammation of the}} stomach and small intestine. These can include those organisms that cause <b>foodborne</b> illnesses. Gastroenteritis is the most common disease of the GI tract.|$|E
25|$|Microwave ovens are {{frequently}} used for reheating leftover food, and bacterial contamination {{may not be}} repressed if the safe temperature is not reached, resulting in <b>foodborne</b> illness, as with all inadequate reheating methods.|$|E
25|$|The {{doubling}} of U.S. food imports {{over the last}} five years is one of the factors contributing to tens of millions of <b>foodborne</b> illnesses and 9,000 deaths that occur annually, and the trend is up.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, using FoodNet {{data from}} 2000–2007, the CDCP {{estimated}} there were 47.8 million <b>foodborne</b> illnesses per year (16,000 cases for 100,000 inhabitants) with 9.4 million of these caused by 31 known identified pathogens.|$|E
25|$|The World Health Organization Department of Food Safety and Zoonoses (FOS) {{provides}} {{scientific advice}} for {{organizations and the}} public on issues concerning the safety of food. Its mission is to lower the burden of <b>foodborne</b> disease, thereby strengthening the health security and sustainable development of Member States. <b>Foodborne</b> and waterborne diarrhoeal diseases kill an estimated 2.2 million people annually, {{most of whom are}} children. WHO works closely with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to address food safety issues along the entire food production chain—from production to consumption—using new methods of risk analysis. These methods provide efficient, science-based tools to improve food safety, thereby benefiting both public health and economic development.|$|E
25|$|The genus name Norovirus {{is derived}} from Norwalk virus, the only species of the genus. The species causes {{approximately}} 90% of epidemic nonbacterial outbreaks of gastroenteritis around the world, and {{may be responsible for}} 50% of all <b>foodborne</b> outbreaks of gastroenteritis in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Campylobacteriosis is an {{infection}} by the Campylobacter bacterium, most commonly C. jejuni. It {{is among the}} most common bacterial infections of humans, often a <b>foodborne</b> illness. It produces an inflammatory, sometimes bloody, diarrhea or dysentery syndrome, mostly including cramps, fever and pain.|$|E
25|$|Recently, {{there has}} been an {{increase}} in <b>foodborne</b> illnesses which has put an emphasis on the importance of the safety of the food chain in Lebanon. This raised the illues public awareness. More restaurants are seeking information and compliance with International Organization for Standardization.|$|E
25|$|From 1985-2015 {{there was}} an {{outbreak}} of 91 confirmed cases of <b>foodborne</b> botulism in Canada, 85% of which were in Alaska Native communities, especially the Inuit of Nunavik and First Nations of the coast of British Columbia from eating traditionally prepared marine mammal and fish products.|$|E
25|$|A {{study by}} the Australian National University, {{published}} in November 2014, found in 2010 that there were an estimated 4.1 million cases of <b>foodborne</b> gastroenteritis acquired in Australia on average each year, along with 5,140 cases of non-gastrointestinal illness. The study {{was funded by the}} Australian Department of Health, Food Standards Australia New Zealand and the NSW Food Authority.|$|E
25|$|Membership to INFOSAN is voluntary, but is {{restricted}} to representatives from national and regional government authorities and requires an official letter of designation. INFOSAN seeks to reflect the multidisciplinary nature of food safety and promote intersectoral collaboration by requesting the designation of Focal Points {{in each of the}} respective national authorities with a stake in food safety, and a single Emergency Contact Point in the national authority with the responsibility for coordinating national food safety emergencies; countries choosing to be members of INFOSAN are committed to sharing information between their respective food safety authorities and other INFOSAN members. The operational definition of a food safety authority includes those authorities involved in: food policy; risk assessment; food control and management; food inspection services; <b>foodborne</b> disease surveillance and response; laboratory services for monitoring and surveillance of foods and <b>foodborne</b> diseases; and food safety information, education and communication across the farm-to-table continuum.|$|E
25|$|The {{infectious}} dose is {{the amount}} of agent that must be consumed to give rise to symptoms of <b>foodborne</b> illness, and varies according to the agent and the consumer's age and overall health. Pathogens vary in minimum infectious dose; for example, Shigella sonnei has a low estimated minimum dose of < 500 colony-forming units (CFU) while Staphylococcus aureus has a relatively high estimate.|$|E
25|$|In the United States {{an average}} of 145 cases are {{reported}} each year. Of these, roughly 65% are infant botulism, 20% are wound botulism, and 15% are <b>foodborne.</b> Infant botulism is predominantly sporadic and not associated with epidemics, but great geographic variability exists. From 1974 to 1996, for example, 47% of all infant botulism cases reported in the U.S. occurred in California.|$|E
25|$|If {{irradiation}} was {{to become}} common in the food handling process {{there would be a}} reduction of the prevalence of <b>foodborne</b> illness and potentially the eradication of specific pathogens. However, multiple studies suggest that an increased rate of pathogen growth may occur when irradiated food is cross-contaminated with a pathogen, as the competing spoilage organisms are no longer present. This being said, cross contamination itself becomes less prevalent with an increase in usage of irradiated foods.|$|E
25|$|The OutbreakNet, a {{group of}} state public health {{officers}} who investigate <b>foodborne</b> infection outbreaks, shared information with CDC that indicated that Oregon and Wisconsin were considering the same hypothesis: fresh spinach was the possible vehicle of infection. The group tracked and updated the increasing case count and exposure information. During a multistate call on Thursday, September 14, the group noted that the data strongly suggested that fresh spinach was a likely source. Within 24 hours of the outbreak, the data indicated that the outbreak was probably ongoing.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{recorded}} {{outbreak of}} <b>foodborne</b> botulism in the United Kingdom occurred in June 1989. A total of 27 patients were affected; one patient died. Twenty-five {{of the patients}} had eaten one brand of hazelnut yogurt in {{the week before the}} onset of symptoms. Control measures included the cessation of all yogurt production by the implicated producer, the withdrawal of the firm's yogurts from sale, the recall of cans of the hazelnut conserve, and advice to the general public to avoid the consumption of all hazelnut yogurts.|$|E
25|$|Campylobacter {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes of human {{bacterial}} gastroenteritis. For instance, an estimated 2 million cases of Campylobacter enteritis occur annually in the U.S., accounting for 5–7% of cases of gastroenteritis. Furthermore, in the United Kingdom during 2000, Campylobacter jejuni was involved in 77.3% in all cases of laboratory confirmed <b>foodborne</b> illness. About 15 of every 100,000 people are diagnosed with campylobacteriosis every year, and with many cases going unreported, up to 0.5% of the general population may unknowingly harbor Campylobacter in their gut.|$|E
25|$|In produce, {{microorganisms}} {{attach to}} the surfaces and biofilms develop internally. During the washing process, biofilms resist sanitization and allow bacteria to spread across the produce. This problem {{is also found in}} ready to eat foods because the foods go through limited cleaning procedures before consumption Due to the perishability of dairy products and limitations in cleaning procedures, resulting in the buildup of bacteria, dairy is susceptible to biofilm formation and contamination. The bacteria can spoil the products more readily and contaminated products pose a health risk to consumers. One bacteria that can be found in various industries and is a major cause of <b>foodborne</b> disease is Salmonella. Large amounts of salmonella contamination {{can be found in the}} poultry processing industry as about 50% of salmonella strains can produce biofilms on poultry farms. Salmonella increases the risk of <b>foodborne</b> illnesses when the poultry products are not cleaned and cooked correctly. Salmonella is also found in the seafood industry where biofilms form from seafood borne pathogens on the seafood itself as well as in water. Shrimp products are commonly affected by salmonella because of unhygienic processing and handling techniques The preparation practices of shrimp and other seafood products can allow for bacteria buildup on the products.|$|E
25|$|E. coli O157:H7 is a potent, highly infectious, ACDP (Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens, UK) Hazard Group 3 <b>foodborne</b> and {{waterborne}} pathogen. The bacterium produces potent toxins {{that cause}} diarrhea, severe aches and nausea in infected persons. Symptoms of severe infections include hemolytic colitis (bloody diarrhea), hemolytic uremic syndrome (kidney disease), and death. E. coli O157:H7 {{has become a}} serious public health threat because of its increased incidence and because children up to 14 years of age, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals {{are at risk of}} incurring the most severe symptoms.|$|E
25|$|In one {{outbreak}} at {{an international}} scout jamboree in the Netherlands, each person with gastroenteritis infected an average of 14 people before increased hygiene measures were put in place. Even after these new measures were enacted, an ill person still infected an average of 2.1 other people. A US CDC study of 11 outbreaks in New York State lists the suspected mode of transmission as person-to-person in seven outbreaks, <b>foodborne</b> in two, waterborne in one, and one unknown. The source of waterborne outbreaks may include water from municipal supplies, wells, recreational lakes, swimming pools and ice machines.|$|E
25|$|Supporters of raw feeding {{believe that}} the natural diet of raw meat, bones, and organs is nutritionally {{superior}} to cooked meat and commercial pet food. They argue that a careful plan of a raw diet gives the animal numerous health benefits, including a healthier coat and cleaner teeth and elimination of bad breath. Critics of raw feeding assert {{that the risk of}} nutritional imbalance, intestinal perforations and <b>foodborne</b> illnesses posed by the handling and feeding of raw meat and bones outweigh any benefits. The assertion that raw feeding is inherently better because it is natural has also been criticized by proponents of commercial pet foods.|$|E
25|$|The 2011 United States {{listeriosis}} outbreak was {{a widespread}} outbreak of Listeria monocytogenes food poisoning across 28 US states {{that resulted from}} contaminated cantaloupes linked to Jensen Farms of Holly, Colorado. As of the final report on December 8, 2011, there were 30 deaths and 147 total confirmed cases {{since the beginning of}} the first recorded case on July 31, 2011. It was the worst <b>foodborne</b> illness outbreak in the United States, measured by the number of deaths, since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began tracking outbreaks in the 1970s, or tied with the worst, an outbreak of listeria from cheese in 1985, depending on which CDC report is used.|$|E
