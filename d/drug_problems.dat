5|$|During {{his major}} league career, Wiggins {{struggled}} with drug addiction, {{which resulted in}} multiple arrests and suspensions from baseball. His <b>drug</b> <b>problems</b> prompted a 1985 trade from San Diego to Baltimore, where Wiggins spent three seasons. After leaving baseball, {{he was diagnosed with}} AIDS. He was the first MLB player known to die of AIDS. Long after his death, two of Wiggins' children, Candice and Alan, Jr., became professional basketball players.|$|E
5|$|Ellis {{lived in}} Apple Valley, California. He worked in Victorville, California {{as a drug}} counselor. He also counseled prisoners in Pittsburgh and at a prison in Adelanto, California. The Yankees hired Ellis in the 1980s to work with their minor league players, {{including}} Pascual Perez, whom he counseled for <b>drug</b> <b>problems.</b> In 2005, Ellis began teaching weekly classes for individuals convicted of driving under the influence. Ellis also appeared in the 1986 film Gung Ho, directed by Ron Howard.|$|E

5|$|In August, {{the band}} {{appeared}} at the Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington in the United Kingdom, performing {{to an audience of}} more than 100,000. One show featured a guest appearance by Metallica drummer (and Mustaine's former bandmate) Lars Ulrich. The band was added to the Monsters of Rock European tour, but left after the first show due to Ellefson's <b>drug</b> <b>problems,</b> for which he was treated immediately.|$|E
5|$|The Amps were an American alternative/indie rock group. Formed by Kim Deal in 1995 {{after her}} band the Breeders went on hiatus, the group {{consisted}} of Deal, vocals and guitars; Luis Lerma, bass; Nate Farley, guitars; and the Breeders' Jim Macpherson, drums. The Breeders' Kelley Deal, Kim's sister, was also briefly involved, but {{had to leave the}} band due to <b>drug</b> <b>problems.</b> The group was named when Kim Deal started calling herself Tammy Ampersand for fun, and the band Tammy and the Amps. They recorded the album Pacer in Ireland and the United States.|$|E
5|$|Wiggins and {{his mother}} were very close, and her 1983 Alzheimer's disease {{diagnosis}} {{may have contributed to}} his <b>drug</b> <b>problems.</b> He was devastated that she {{would not be able to}} enjoy his success in the major leagues. In the last few years of Wiggins' life, he enjoyed a closer relationship with his father, Albert, and he often took his children on visits to see their grandfather. Wiggins had a very difficult time with his father's death in May 1990.|$|E

5|$|In August 1979, {{the band}} entered Wessex Studios to begin {{recording}} London Calling. The Clash asked Guy Stevens {{to produce the}} album, much {{to the dismay of}} CBS Records. Stevens had alcohol and <b>drug</b> <b>problems</b> and his production methods were unconventional. During a recording session he swung a ladder and upturned chairs – apparently to create a rock & roll atmosphere. The Clash, especially bassist Paul Simonon, got along well with Stevens, and found Stevens' work to be very helpful and productive to both Simonon's playing and their recording as a band. The album was recorded during a five- to six-week period involving 18-hour days, with many songs recorded in one or two takes.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of {{the causes}} of the Breeders' hiatus, by early 1995 Deal {{believed}} her next album would be a solo one, and at first intended to play all instruments on it herself. Back at her home in Dayton, Ohio, she practiced the drums and initially prepared six songs for recording. Around the same time, she produced some tracks for Guided by Voices at Easley Studios in Memphis, Tennessee. While there, Deal used a portion of the studio time to record demos for some of her new songs. As an attempt to distract her sister from her <b>drug</b> <b>problems,</b> Deal recruited Kelley to play on three songs at this initial recording session. Kelley's involvement changed Deal's mind about playing all the instruments herself, and she began to conceptualize the album as a band project.|$|E
5|$|Robinson's eldest son, Jackie Robinson Jr., had {{emotional}} trouble {{during his}} childhood and entered special education {{at an early}} age. He enrolled in the Army {{in search of a}} disciplined environment, served in the Vietnam War, and was wounded in action on November 19, 1965. After his discharge, he struggled with <b>drug</b> <b>problems.</b> Robinson Jr. eventually completed the treatment program at Daytop Village in Seymour, Connecticut, and became a counselor at the institution. On June 17, 1971, he was killed in an automobile accident at age 24. The experience with his son's drug addiction turned Robinson Sr. into an avid anti-drug crusader {{toward the end of his}} life.|$|E

Chapter II presents a long-term perspective on the characteristics and evolution of the <b>drug</b> <b>problem</b> and the main factors that shaped it. It starts with a discussion of the main characteristics of the contemporary <b>drug</b> <b>problem,</b> followed by an overview of the shifts observed over the last few de cades, before concluding with an analysis of the driving factors that shaped the evolution of the <b>drug</b> <b>problem,</b> including a brief outlook for its likely future direction...|$|R
5|$|Yet {{the band}} members' <b>drug</b> <b>problems</b> still stood in their way. In 1986, Tyler {{completed}} a successful drug rehabilitation program, after an intervention by his fellow band members, a doctor, and manager Tim Collins, {{who believed that}} the band's future would not be bright if Tyler did not get treated. The rest of the band members also completed drug rehab programs {{over the course of}} the next couple of years. According to the band's tell-all autobiography, Collins pledged in September 1986 he could make Aerosmith the biggest band in the world by 1990 if they all completed drug rehab. Their next album was crucial because of the commercial disappointment of Done With Mirrors, and as the band members became clean, they worked hard to make their next album a success.|$|E
5|$|Despite his superpowers, Parker {{struggles to}} help his widowed aunt pay rent, is taunted by his peers—particularly {{football}} star Flash Thompson—and, as Spider-Man, engenders the editorial wrath of newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson. As he battles his enemies for the first time, Parker finds juggling his personal life and costumed adventures difficult. In time, Peter graduates from high school, and enrolls at Empire State University (a fictional institution evoking the real-life Columbia University and New York University), where he meets roommate and best friend Harry Osborn, and girlfriend Gwen Stacy, and Aunt May introduces him to Mary Jane Watson. As Peter deals with Harry's <b>drug</b> <b>problems,</b> and Harry's father is revealed to be Spider-Man's nemesis the Green Goblin, Peter even attempts {{to give up his}} costumed identity for a while. Gwen Stacy's father, New York City Police detective captain George Stacy is accidentally killed during a battle between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus (#90, November 1970).|$|E
5|$|Now {{settled into}} Warner Bros. Records, the Chili Peppers {{began looking for}} a {{suitable}} producer. One person in particular, Rick Rubin, stood out, as he was more broadminded in contrast to individuals they had worked with in the past even though Rubin previously turned down the band's offer to produce their 1987 album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan due to the <b>drug</b> <b>problems</b> of Kiedis and guitarist Hillel Slovak who would die of a heroin overdose a year later. Eventually, the band decided Rubin {{would be the best}} choice as a producer, and therefore hired him to produce what would become Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Unlike the Peppers' previous producers, Rubin was someone that they felt confident to ask for guidance and input during times of difficulty. He would often help arrange drum beats, guitar melodies and lyrics.|$|E

40|$|The {{project has}} {{examined}} drug consumption {{as a political}} problem and its ideological undertones. It is shown how drugs and drug consumption often have been subordinate in problem descriptions that have fulfilled other political purposes. Worries about politically radical youth, foreign religions or incomprehensible music have been understood as a <b>drug</b> <b>problem.</b> In the Swedish parliament the <b>drug</b> <b>problem</b> has been {{described in terms of}} capitalist class oppression, Americanism or cultural superficiality. Modernity, urbanization and industrialization have also been criticized {{in the name of the}} <b>drug</b> <b>problem.</b> In the treatment centres and within the ruling bureaucracy it was also elucidated that the <b>drug</b> <b>problem</b> was an ideological problem. The effective treatment method has been elusive, but the effective method has also played second fiddle in the choice of treatment solutions. Other values have been awarded, such as rural romanticism, Swedishness, solidarity and diligence. Individualism, Americanism and profit making have also been opposed within the ideological treatment sector. At the end of the research period such assessments however became subordinate to an overarching ideological quest to make substance abuse treatment a market among others...|$|R
