50|$|Ideasthesia {{refers to}} the {{capability}} of our minds to experience meaning.

5|$|De re militari, a {{treatise}} on Roman military affairs by Vegetius, a late 4th or early 5th-century writer, contains considerable {{information on the}} late army, although its {{focus is on the}} army of the Republic and Principate. However, Vegetius (who wholly lacked military <b>experience)</b> <b>is</b> often unreliable. For example, he stated that the army abandoned armour and helmets in the later 4th century (offering the absurd explanation that this equipment was too heavy), which is contradicted by sculptural and artistic evidence. In general, it is not safe to accept a statement from Vegetius unless it is corroborated by other evidence.|$|E
5|$|Do I wish I {{had never}} endured post-partum depression? Absolutely. But {{to deny the}} <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> to deny who I am. I still mourn the loss of what could have been, but I also feel deep {{gratitude}} for those who stood by me, for the lesson that we must never be afraid to ask for help, and for the feeling of summer that still remains.|$|E
5|$|Fremantle Prison {{receives}} {{international and}} domestic tourists, as well as ex-prisoners, former prison officers, and their descendants. Tourist numbers increased each year from 2001/02 to 2009/10, up from almost 105,000 to nearly 180,000 over that period. , the prison has won, been a finalist in, or received other commendation at tourism or heritage awards each year since 2006. While the tourist <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> based on authenticity and heritage values, some details are concealed or de-emphasised, such as prison tattooing, riots, and graffiti portraying revenge, sexuality, or brutality.|$|E
50|$|Further {{blurring}} {{the lines of}} behavioral spheres, Gabriel Weimann wrote that media scholars have found that virtual <b>experiences</b> <b>are</b> very similar to real-life experiences, and people can confuse their own memories and have trouble remembering if those <b>experiences</b> <b>were</b> mediated or not.|$|R

Theodore then sees Amy, who is upset with the departure of the OS that she had befriended, and they go to the roof of their apartment building where they sit down together and watch the sun rise over the city.|$|E
5|$|On 12 January 2016, Alton Towers {{announced}} that Air would be re-themed as Galactica for the 2016 season and would include on-ride virtual reality headsets simulating a {{ride through the}} cosmos. The announcement was made at an event held at the Science Museum. Each seat on the roller coaster is fitted with a Samsung Gear VR headset and pouch. The virtual reality <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> optional, as guests can choose to ride without using the headsets. A promotional website was also released explaining {{more information about the}} ride and its new storyline. In late February 2016, the park {{announced that}} the official opening date would be 24 March 2016.|$|E

The park's tag line for this <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> 'THE SWARM- Brave It Backwards'. The park additionally announced that they were adding a damaged, mangled billboard, which the train travels through. In 2016 the seats were returned to all facing forwards.|$|E

50|$|Mystical {{experience}} - Mystical <b>experiences</b> <b>are</b> in {{many ways}} the opposite of numinous experiences. In the mystical experience, all 'otherness' disappear and the believer becomes one with the transcendent. The believer discovers {{that he or she is}} not distinct from the cosmos, the deity or the other reality, but one with it. Zaehner has identified two distinctively different mystical experiences: natural and religious mystical experiences (Charlesworth: 1988). Natural mystical <b>experiences</b> <b>are,</b> for example, <b>experiences</b> of the 'deeper self' or experiences of oneness with nature. Zaehner argues that the experiences typical of 'natural mysticism' are quite different from the experiences typical of religious mysticism (Charlesworth: 1988). Natural mystical <b>experiences</b> <b>are</b> not considered to <b>be</b> religious <b>experiences</b> because they <b>are</b> not linked to a particular tradition, but natural mystical <b>experiences</b> <b>are</b> spiritual <b>experiences</b> that can have a profound effect on the individual.|$|R
5|$|Songs of <b>Experience</b> <b>is</b> {{the second}} studio album by American {{composer}} and producer David Axelrod, released in October 1969 by Capitol Records. It was composed, arranged, and produced by Axelrod, {{who worked with}} session musicians such as guitarist Al Casey, drummer Earl Palmer, and conductor Don Randi. As with his 1968 debut album Song of Innocence, Axelrod composed musical interpretations of English poet William Blake's Songs of Innocence and of Experience, an 18th-century illustrated collection of poems.|$|E
5|$|Sri Aurobindo {{argues that}} divine Brahman manifests as {{empirical}} reality through līlā, or divine play.

5|$|The MSE {{derives from}} an {{approach}} to psychiatry known as descriptive psychopathology or descriptive phenomenology, which developed {{from the work of}} the philosopher and psychiatrist Karl Jaspers. From Jaspers' perspective it was assumed {{that the only way to}} comprehend a patient's <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> through his or her own description (through an approach of empathic and non-theoretical enquiry), as distinct from an interpretive or psychoanalytic approach which assumes the analyst might understand experiences or processes of which the patient is unaware, such as defense mechanisms or unconscious drives.|$|E

5|$|The {{first chapter}} asks what {{religion}} is, stating that religious thought is contradictory, {{is rooted in}} intuition, and that God is fundamentally a mystery. The second and third chapters look at the negative divine - the characterisation of God as void, silence or non-being - which Stace maintains is an idea found in all religions. He maintains that mystical <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> shared by all mankind, {{it is only the}} theories about it that differ. On this point he says he is in agreement with Otto. In this experience the distinction between subject and object is overcome, indeed there is no difference between the experiencer and the experience.|$|E
5|$|The rider's <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> {{dependent}} upon the location of her or his seat on the train. Screens are located {{on both sides of}} the track but the only continuous screen on the track is on the right-hand side. The train makes several tight turns during the ride; riders facing forward experience all the animations while riders facing backward miss some scenes because of the lack of screen space. The cars rotate 90 degrees clockwise to face the screens; forward-facing riders rotate toward the continuous screen.|$|E

30|$|For an {{empirical}} phenomenological educational science, {{the primacy of}} experience raises the difficulty, that subjective <b>experiences</b> <b>are</b> not accessible in an unmediated way. <b>Experiences</b> <b>are</b> not ‘visible’ in video data, {{which is why we}} place our focus on the lived body as a medium of embodiment of subjective experiences.|$|R
40|$|Any {{educational}} process involves four distinct stages: {{the selection of}} goals, the selection of learning experiences, the organization of these experiences and the evaluation of achievement. If the results of evaluation are unsatisfactory, then the goals were unrealistic, the learning <b>experiences</b> <b>were</b> inadequate, or the <b>experiences</b> <b>were</b> poorly organized...|$|R
5|$|The theologian Sallie McFague {{believes}} that the more recent problem of religious language is based on individual experience, owing to the increased secularisation of society. She notes that human <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> of this world rather than regular encounters with the divine, which makes the experience of God uncommon and potentially unnecessary. Because of this, she argues, religious language is both idolatrous because it fails to express sufficient awe of God, and irrelevant because without adequate words it becomes meaningless.|$|E
5|$|There is a clifftop {{walk from}} Jacob's Ladder along {{the crest of}} the gorge and back to the road, with views of the gorge. A caving <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> offered within Gough's Cave. There is a path of 275steps, built {{up the side of the}} gorge, known as Jacob's Ladder after the Biblical {{description}} of a ladder to the heavens. A watchtower at the top provides a 360–degree view of the entire area and village. An open-top bus tour operates during the summer. Cheddar cheese is made in the lower part of the gorge.|$|E
5|$|Three centuries {{after the}} death of the Buddha (c. 150 BCE) saw the growth of a large body of {{literature}} called the Abhidharma in several contending Buddhist schools. In the Abdhidharmic analysis of mind, the ordinary thought is defined as prapañca ('conceptual proliferation'). According to this theory, perceptual <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> bound up in multiple conceptualizations (expectations, judgments and desires). This proliferation of conceptualizations form our illusory superimposition of concepts like self and other upon an ever changing stream of aggregate phenomena.|$|E

40|$|Intermodal representationalists {{hold that}} the phenomenal {{characters}} of <b>experiences</b> <b>are</b> fully determined by their contents. In contrast, intramodal representationalists hold that the phenomenal characters of <b>experiences</b> <b>are</b> determined by their contents {{together with their}} intentional modes or manners of representation, which are nonrepresentational features corresponding roughly to the sensory modalities. This paper discusses a kind of experience that provides evidence for an intermodal representationalist view: intermodal experiences, experiences that unify experiences in different modalities. I argue that such <b>experiences</b> <b>are</b> much easier to explain on the intermodal view...|$|R
40|$|I {{present a}} {{framework}} {{to explain how}} <b>experiences</b> <b>are</b> different from products, and how these differences influence consumers' processing and evaluation of experiences versus products, before choice. I define an experience as an event or {{series of events that}} a consumer lives through, while a product is a tangible object, kept in one's possession (Van Boven and Gilovich 2003). <b>Experiences</b> <b>are</b> central to consumers' lives and to businesses, but most consumer research so far has focused on tangible objects, paying less attention to intangibles such as experiences (Carter and Gilovich 2012; Holbrook and Hirschman 1982; Sun, Tat Keh, and Lee 2012). My framework has two parts. In the first part I suggest that the evaluation of <b>experiences</b> <b>is</b> associated with uncertainty and multidimensionality and that, as a consequence, <b>experiences</b> <b>are</b> better evaluated through holistic processing rather than analytic processing. In the second part I study how these differences influence consumers' processing and evaluation of experiences compared to products. I suggest that <b>experiences</b> <b>are</b> evaluated closer to the self, more vividly, and more in the form of narratives...|$|R
