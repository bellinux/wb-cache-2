40|$|In {{the paper}} {{the results of}} <b>welding</b> of <b>girth</b> <b>welded</b> joints of steel pipe API 5 L grade X 70 (L 485 M) are presented. GMA welding and two {{categories}} of strength of <b>girth</b> <b>welded</b> joints (100 - 110 % and 110 - 130 % of strength of base metal) have been adopted. The weldability tests of base metal as well as numerical modelling for welding process were also carried out. The results of the simulated HAZ confirmed that in the HAZ of the <b>girth</b> <b>welded</b> joints will have high fracture toughness, however, the cooling time t 8 / 5 should be under 10 s. Hardness in the simulated HAZ does not exceed 300 HV for real time value t 8 / 5 cooling occurring during welding, which indicates a low tendency to hardening of steel in the HAZ and hence a high resistance to cold cracking of steel. This was confirmed by the Tekken test. Even in the welding without preheating the cracks not occurred in the base metal and HAZ. The hardness was lower than 380 HV. Taken into account that the specific cooling time t 8 / 5 has to be lower than 10 s during welding API 5 L X 70 steel the numerical models were prepared in the Sysweld software and verified experimentally. The verification of the numerical modelling confirmed the compatibility of the models. Two welding filler metals were used to weld the preliminary welded joints as well as <b>girth</b> <b>welded</b> joints.

40|$|Purpose: Position welding {{technology}} {{was developed by}} using disk laser-GMA hybrid welding in this research. Design/methodology/approach: The effect of hybrid welding parameters such as the shielding gas composition and laser-arc interspacing distance were investigated for the bead-on-plate <b>welding.</b> The pipe <b>girth</b> <b>welding</b> was implemented and the adequate arc welding parameters were selected according to the welding position from a flat position to an overhead position. Findings: The optimized shielding gas composition and laser-arc interspacing distance for disk laser-GMA hybrid welding were 80 % Ar- 20 % CO 2 and 2 mm, respectively for the bead-on-plate welding. The sound welds could be achieved even in the pipe <b>girth</b> <b>welding,</b> but the proper joint shape should be prepared.

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for energy has motivated {{the oil and}} natural gas exploration in very hostile environments, including very deep water operation and the transport of corrosive fluids. Technological advances favor the use of high strength steel pipelines either clad or mechanically lined with a corrosion resistant alloy (CRA), such as Alloy 625, for the transport of corrosive hydrocarbons. Moreover, these pipelines are subjected to severe installation conditions and a case of interest is the pipe reeling process which allows pipe welding and inspection to be conducted at onshore facilities. While cost effective, fracture assessments and specification of critical flaw sizes for the <b>girth</b> <b>welds</b> of lined/clad pipes become more complex due to the dissimilar nature of these materials and the high levels of plastic strain imposed during installation. In particular, effective analyses of crack driving forces in undermatched or partially mismatched pipe <b>girth</b> <b>welds</b> remain essential to determine more accurate acceptable flaw sizes for the piping system based upon conventional ECA procedures.

40|$|Abstract. In the German {{pipeline}} industry {{ultrasonic testing}} (UT) {{has been and}} still is the method favoured over radiographic testing (RT) for the inspection of <b>girth</b> <b>welds.</b> However, in the internationally widely applied Standard API 1104 (Welding of Pipelines and Related Facilities) till the nineteenth edition, September 1999, UT was of secondary importance when compared to RT. The NDT requirements in API 1104 are contrary to the NDT requirements in API 5 L (Line Pipes), which are applied in pipe mills for the longitudinal and spiral welds, specifically for the continuous and uninterrupted inspection of welds by ultrasonic means (Automatic respectively mechanized UT). Common line pipe specifications like API 5 L and EN 10208 (Steel Pipes for pipe lines for combustible fluids) include clear definitions about the reference standards used and define clearly the acceptance criteria for the applied ultrasonic inspection. As long as the NDT of <b>girth</b> <b>welds</b> is based on European Standards, the testing parameters including reference criteria and acceptance criteria for the ultrasonic inspection are also clearly defined.

The paper gives examples of new technologies currently being developed in NDT and investigates how these technologies could add value, in the field, on weld testing and assessment. The guiding principle in this investigation is that the data gathered in NDT should be sufficient for making an engineering decision. It will be argued that this is not currently the case as NDT is now used in a qualitative check on the welding process rather than a quantitative information source on the weld strength. An overview of technologies like Inverse Wave Extrapolation (IWEX), Full Matrix Capture (FMC), and Sampling Phased Array (SPA) will be given. These technologies show promise to increase the quality of data received from Automated Ultrasonic Testing (AUT) of pipeline <b>girth</b> <b>weld.</b> The most important improvement is that an image of the defect is generated, in three dimensions, which allows for improved assessment of the impact of detected flaws on the weld strength.

In the investigation of X 80 welds, a series of experimental single and dual torch gas metal arc welds were prepared with three C-Mn-Si wires, which contained additions of Ti, Ni-Ti and Ni-Mo-Ti. The weld metal microstructures, tensile properties, notch toughness, and fracture resistance were evaluated. The results indicate that high weld metal yield strength and good toughness can be achieved. The X 80 single torch welds exhibited higher yield strength but lower toughness compared to the corresponding dual torch welds. For the development and evaluation of welding procedures for mainline <b>girth</b> <b>welding</b> of X 100 pipe, two narrow gap mechanized gas metal arc welding procedures were evaluated with emphasis placed on measurement of the tensile properties.

40|$|The total {{fatigue life}} of a brace in an {{offshore}} jacket structure is conventionally considered in four parts. N 1 {{is the number of}} cycles to initiate the first discernible surface cracking as noted by any available method. N 2 is the number of cycles to detect surface cracking by visual examination without the use of crack enhancement or optical aids. N 3 is the number of cycles until the first through wall cracking and N 4 is the total number of cycles to the end of test or final separation of the member. The majority of fatigue tests conducted on tubular connections or on <b>girth</b> <b>welds</b> in brace members obtained only N 3 results, it being common practice to stop testing when a through wall crack was present.

40|$|The {{location}} {{of oil and}} gas reserves in Australia and the distribution of centres of population have created a need for an extensive network of land based transmission pipelines. There is a continuing need to expand this network but this must be achieved within increasingly stringent cost targets and in accordance with changing environmental constraints. The pipeline industry in Australia has traditionally employed smaller diameter and thinner wall pipe materials than are common in many other parts of the world. In order to improve cost effectiveness there is also a trend to increase the yield strength of the material and to further reduce wall thickness. <b>Girth</b> <b>welding</b> of pipelines in the field represents a significant proportion of the installation cost and is currently performed by highly skilled manual welders using the shielded metal arc process (SMAW), cellulosic electrodes and a 2 ̆ 7 stovepipe 2 ̆ 7 technique. The use of lower wall thickness has the potential {{to reduce the number of}} weld runs and the overall cost. The higher yield strength low alloy pipe materials have been shown to have excellent weldability but as yield strength increases there may be an increased risk of weld metal cracking, particularly if overmatching welds are required. The current Australian field welding practice has been analysed and the local constraints identified. Based on this review a list of desirable attributes for suitable processes was drawn up. The international literature on process options for mechanised <b>girth</b> <b>welding</b> was reviewed and techniques, which fitted the Australian requirements were identified. The most attractive mechanised <b>girth</b> <b>welding</b> options for further investigation were identified as: • GMAW (New technology controlled transfer) • Pulsed plasma keyhole welding • High current (buried arc/keyhole) GTAW 3 ̆c• MIAB welding The rationale behind these suggestions is discussed and the implications for the pipeline industry in adopting mechanised <b>girth</b> <b>welding</b> are explored.

In addition, the weld metal mechanical properties may only be partly overmatching compared to the base material. For operational conditions where the local material utilization exceeds the elastic limit, commonly used assessment methods based on analytical fracture models such as BS 7910 might be inadequate for clad pipelines, and more detailed finite element modeling must be performed. This paper addresses the relevant load scenarios for a clad steel pipeline installed by S-lay. A dedicated finite element program, LINKpipe has been used for the analyses to verify the acceptance criteria for defects in the <b>girth</b> <b>welds.</b> Input data for the analyses are taken from the detailed pipeline design calculations and material testing of the actual <b>welding</b> procedures of <b>girth</b> <b>welds...</b>|$|R
