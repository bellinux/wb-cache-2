5|$|Carlson {{and the two}} companies, with Company B leading, marched west {{towards the}} village of Asamana on the Metapona River. While {{crossing}} the river, the Marines captured two <b>Japanese</b> <b>soldiers</b> and killed a third who happened by in a native boat, then attacked and occupied Asamana, surprising and killing several <b>Japanese</b> <b>soldiers</b> in the village. Signs in Japanese in the village indicated that it was {{being used as a}} rallying location for Shōji's forces. Occupying defensive positions around the village and river crossing, the raiders killed 25Japanese soldiers that approached the village during the remainder of the day.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Japanese</b> <b>soldiers</b> {{eventually}} find Ip at {{the cotton}} mill. Ip tells Chow {{to take his}} wife and son away for protection. Miura tells Ip that his life will be spared if he agrees to instruct the <b>Japanese</b> <b>soldiers</b> in martial arts. Ip refuses and challenges Miura to a match, which Miura accepts, both because of his love for martial arts and because refusing the challenge would be a humiliation to the Japanese. The match between Ip and Miura is held in public in Foshan's square. Sato tells Ip that his life will be spared if he lets the general win.|$|E
5|$|The Marines {{captured}} 12 37mm anti-tank guns, one 70mm {{field artillery}} piece, and 34 machineguns and counted the dead bodies of 239 <b>Japanese</b> <b>soldiers,</b> including 28 officers.|$|E

5|$|As the {{sun rose}} on 14 September, pockets of <b>Japanese</b> <b>soldiers</b> {{remained}} scattered along {{both sides of the}} ridge. But with Tamura's battalion shattered after losing three-quarters of its officers and men, and with heavy casualties to his other attacking units as well, Kawaguchi's assault on the ridge had effectively ended. About 100 <b>Japanese</b> <b>soldiers</b> still remained in the open on the south slope of Hill 80, perhaps preparing for one more charge on Hill 123. At first light, three U.S. Army P-400 Airacobra fighters from the 67th Fighter Squadron at Henderson Field, acting on a request personally delivered by Bailey, strafed the Japanese near Hill 80 and killed most of them, with the few survivors retreating back into the jungle.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>soldiers</b> {{killed during}} the assault ranged from 530 to 1,000. The {{estimates}} include the 73 guards and approximately 150 traveling Japanese who stayed in the camp that night, {{as well as those}} killed by Pajota's men attempting to cross the Cabu River.|$|E
5|$|The {{logistical}} {{demands of}} the surrender were formidable. After Japan's capitulation, more than 5,400,000 <b>Japanese</b> <b>soldiers</b> and 1,800,000 Japanese sailors were taken prisoner by the Allies. The damage done to Japan's infrastructure, combined with a severe famine in 1946, further complicated the Allied efforts to feed the Japanese POWs and civilians.|$|E

5|$|A {{recurring}} {{horror story}} on many websites and popular media outlets is that <b>Japanese</b> <b>soldiers</b> during World War II inflicted bamboo torture upon prisoners of war. The victim was supposedly tied securely in place above a young bamboo shoot. Over several days, the sharp, fast growing shoot would first puncture, then completely penetrate the victim's body, eventually emerging {{through the other}} side. Possibility of this method was tested on an episode of MythBusters, and confirmed.|$|E
5|$|After {{three days}} of {{covering}} the offensive on Betio Island, she moved to Apamama Island to guard Marine landings there. Marines met with only light resistance from 30 <b>Japanese</b> <b>soldiers</b> there, and two prisoners were brought to Maryland. On 7 December, Maryland left Apamama Island for Pearl Harbor. After a brief stopover there, Maryland left for San Francisco for repairs.|$|E
5|$|Although some <b>Japanese</b> <b>soldiers</b> {{were taken}} prisoner, most fought {{until they were}} killed or {{committed}} suicide. Nearly 99% of the 21,000 defenders of Iwo Jima were killed. Of the 117,000 Japanese troops defending Okinawa in April–June 1945, 94% were killed. American military leaders used these figures to estimate high casualties among American soldiers in the planned invasion of Japan.|$|E

5|$|During the 1593 Siege of Pyongyang, 40,000 Ming troops {{deployed}} {{a variety}} of cannon against Japanese troops. Despite their defensive advantage {{and the use of}} arquebus by <b>Japanese</b> <b>soldiers,</b> the Japanese were at a severe disadvantage due to their lack of cannon. Throughout the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98), the Ming-Joseon coalition used artillery widely in land and naval battles, including on the turtle ships of Yi Sun-sin.|$|E
5|$|During {{the day of}} 25 October, Puller's men {{attacked}} and eradicated the salient in their lines and hunted small groups of Japanese infiltrators, killing 104 <b>Japanese</b> <b>soldiers.</b> More than 300 of Maruyama's men in total were killed in their first attacks on the Lunga perimeter. At 04:30, Hyakutake rescinded the message announcing the capture of the airfield, but at 07:00 declared {{that the results of}} Maruyama's attack were unknown.|$|E
5|$|Early on 31 August, the 2/12th Infantry Battalion {{began moving}} towards KB Mission, with 'D' Company {{leading the way}} and {{struggling}} through muddy conditions along the track, which {{had been turned into}} a quagmire due to the heavy rain and equally heavy traffic. After passing through the 61st Infantry Battalion's position, at around 9:00am they began their counterattack along the north coast of Milne Bay. As the Australians went they were harassed by snipers and ambush parties. They also encountered several <b>Japanese</b> <b>soldiers</b> who tried to lure the Australians in close for attack by pretending to be dead. In response, some Australians systematically bayoneted and shot the bodies of <b>Japanese</b> <b>soldiers.</b> At noon, the 9th Infantry Battalion, a Militia unit from the 7th Infantry Brigade, dispatched two companies to occupy some of the ground that the 2/12th had regained around No. 3 Airstrip and the mission.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the capture}} of the city <b>Japanese</b> <b>soldiers</b> massacred Chinese prisoners of war, murdered civilians, and {{committed}} acts of looting and rape in an event known as the Nanking Massacre. Though Japan's military victory excited and emboldened them, the subsequent massacre tarnished their reputation {{in the eyes of}} the world. Contrary to Matsui's expectations, China did not surrender and the Second Sino-Japanese War continued for another eight years.|$|E
5|$|Once {{assembled}} at Nadzab, the 25th Infantry Brigade commenced its {{advance on}} Lae. On 11 September, it engaged the <b>Japanese</b> <b>soldiers</b> at Jensen's Plantation. After defeating them, it engaged and defeated a larger Japanese force at Heath's Plantation. During this skirmish, Private Richard Kelliher won the Victoria Cross, Australia's highest award for gallantry. The Japanese Army elected {{not to fight}} for Lae, preferring instead to withdraw over the Saruwaged Range. This {{proved to be a}} gruelling test of endurance for the <b>Japanese</b> <b>soldiers</b> who had to struggle over the rugged mountains; in the end, the Japanese Army managed to withdraw its forces from Salamaua and Lae, though with extensive losses from exposure and starving during the retreat. Troops of the 25th Infantry Brigade reached Lae shortly before those of the 9th Division that had been advancing on Lae from the opposite direction.|$|E
5|$|Some Japanese holdouts, {{especially}} on small Pacific Islands, refused to surrender at all (believing the declaration to be propaganda or considering surrender against their code). Some {{may never have}} heard of it. Teruo Nakamura, the last known holdout, emerged from his hidden retreat in Indonesia in December 1974, while two other <b>Japanese</b> <b>soldiers,</b> who had joined Communist guerrillas {{at the end of}} the war, fought in southern Thailand until 1991.|$|E

5|$|Sumiyoshi's forces, {{including}} two battalions of the 4th Infantry Regiment under Colonel Nomasu Nakaguma, launched {{attacks on the}} U.S. Marine defenses {{at the mouth of}} the Matanikau on the evening of 23 October. U.S. Marine artillery, cannon, and small arms fire repulsed the assaults and killed many of the attacking <b>Japanese</b> <b>soldiers</b> while suffering only light casualties to themselves.|$|E
5|$|The Australians {{estimated}} Japanese casualties to {{be around}} 700 to 750 killed in action, and a Japanese source reported 625 killed in action. Of the 1,943 <b>Japanese</b> <b>soldiers</b> that were landed at Milne Bay, ships from the Japanese 18th Cruiser Division managed to evacuate 1,318 personnel, including 311 who were wounded. The Australians suffered 373 casualties, of which 167 were killed or missing in action. US forces lost 14 personnel killed and several wounded.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Iwo Jima {{was marked}} {{by some of the}} fiercest {{fighting}} of the Pacific campaign. The battle was the first American attack on the Japanese home islands and the Imperial soldiers defended their positions tenaciously.
