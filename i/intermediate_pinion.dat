40|$|Two input pinion shafts and one 1 st <b>intermediate</b> <b>pinion</b> shaft used in {{gearboxes}} of sugar-crushing mills {{were reported}} to have failed prematurely after about 3, 600 hr of service against a specified life of 100, 000 hr. These shafts were referred to the laboratory for analyzing the cause of failure. Investigation revealed that the pinions have failed by surface contact fatigue/spalling due to low surface hardness and unusual hardness profile on the teeth. Examination also revealed non-uniform case depth and surface hardness from one tooth to another. Studies showed that improper heat treatment of the components was responsible for such metallurgical abnormalities leading to premature failure of the pinions. A detailed analysis of the failure is presented in this report. A few recommendations are also suggested to prevent recurrence of similar failures...|$|E
