5|$|Division III {{is usually}} {{made up of}} one <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>six</b> to eight teams. The top team in each year's tournament is {{promoted}} to Division II Group B. The 2017 Division III tournament, which saw seven teams participate, was held in Sofia, Bulgaria, from 10 to 16 April 2017.|$|E
5|$|The Chacal-class destroyer, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the Jaguar class, were a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>six</b> large destroyers (contre-torpilleurs) built for the French Navy during the 1920s. Their primary role was scouting for the battleline. All were named for predators: Chacal means jackal, and the other five were named for big cats.|$|E
5|$|Division II works {{similarly}} to Division I, with two six-team groups where group 'A' promotes one team to Division I and group 'B' exchanges its last placed team with Division III. Division III is now composed of one <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>six,</b> and {{if more than}} six nations register for this, the lowest level, then a qualification tournament will be held.|$|E

5|$|Giorgio Locatelli {{allegedly}} caused {{criminal damage}} to the restaurant later in 1999 by spitting at the wallpaper, resulting in an estimated £1,300 worth of damage, however the case was dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service. In July 2001, the expenditure of a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>six</b> investment bankers at Pétrus made national news in the UK. Together they spent more than £44,000 on wine, resulting in the restaurant giving them £400 worth of food for nothing.|$|E
5|$|Once there, Achebe was double-promoted in {{his first}} year, {{completing}} the first two years' studies in one, and spending only four years in secondary school, instead of the standard five. Achebe was unsuited to the school's sports regimen and belonged instead to a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>six</b> exceedingly studious pupils. So intense were their study habits that the headmaster banned the reading of textbooks from five to six {{o'clock in the afternoon}} (though other activities and other books were allowed).|$|E
5|$|Plymouth {{was granted}} {{the dignity of}} Lord Mayor by King George V in 1935. The {{position}} is elected each year by a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>six</b> councillors. It is traditional that {{the position of the}} Lord Mayor alternates between the Conservative Party and the Labour Party annually and that the Lord Mayor chooses the Deputy Lord Mayor. Conservative councillor Dr John Mahony is the incumbent for 2015–16.|$|E

Lawson. Copperfield, located on the Snake River in Baker County, had grown up around construction projects for a railroad tunnel and power plant. Fifteen-hundred jobs in the area came from the railway project of E. H. Harriman or the power generation facility.|$|E
5|$|At 10:45am on 12 June Private Haines, a sentry on {{the left}} hand flank, warned of the {{approach}} of an Indonesian foot patrol along the river bank. The Australians had sited the ambush to engage targets on the river and were initially at a disadvantage. Ten minutes after the Indonesians were first seen, Private Sneddon, on the extreme left, engaged a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>six</b> Indonesians with a long burst of machine-gun fire, killing two instantly and a third as he ran towards him. Haines subsequently killed a fourth, while a fifth Indonesian continued past him, followed by five others, who then engaged the Australians. The Indonesian patrol continued to advance, taking them towards {{the rear of the}} Australian positions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} stage, Aucouturier {{had a clear}} lead and seemed set to win a third {{successive}} stage, but was caught using the slipstream of a car, and {{was removed from the}} race. Swiss Charles Laeser (who had abandoned in the 3rd stage) took the victory, becoming the first non-French winner. As in the third stage, the cyclists departed in two groups, and Laeser was in the second group because he was no longer contending for the general classification. Laeser finished more than 50 minutes after a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>six</b> cyclists, but he had travelled the distance 4 minutes faster than them, so he was declared the winner.|$|E

5|$|In {{the weeks}} {{following}} the floods, the Pan American Health Organization provided $10,000 worth of water supply units and a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>six</b> workers, and offices within the United Nations provided $55,000 worth of contributions. The government of Barbados provided five units {{to assist in}} vector control, and the United States donated $25,000 in aid. The European Economic Community donated about $376,300 in assistance. The government of Canada provided $142,490 worth of aid, {{and the government of}} West Germany donated $21,740. The British Red Cross and the United Kingdom government collectively donated $302,850 to the country, mostly for 3helicopters to transport relief and medical teams. The California Air National Guard flew three trips of supplies, including 2,000cots, to Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|On a clear, {{sunny day}} in July 1964, a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>six</b> boys went {{swimming}} in the Roundout Creek at a park in Rosendale Village. After {{getting out of the}} creek, the boys were struck by lightning. One boy was knocked back into the creek, and regained consciousness as he was being pulled out. Two of the boys, Gary Schmitt and Ronald Morelli, died. Ronald Morelli was the son of Albert Morelli, who served as Rosendale's fire chief. Albert Morelli was part of the team that put out the fire at Reid's Village Inn.|$|E
5|$|Seyfert's Sextet is a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>six</b> galaxies, four {{of which}} are {{interacting}} gravitationally and two of which simply {{appear to be a}} part of the group despite their greater distance. The gravitationally bound cluster lies at a distance of 190 million light-years from Earth and is approximately 100,000 light-years across, making Seyfert's Sextet one of the densest galaxy group known. Astronomers predict that the four interacting galaxies will eventually merge to form a large elliptical galaxy. The radio source 3C 326 was originally though to emanate from a giant elliptical galaxy. However, in 1990, it was shown that the source is instead a brighter, smaller galaxy a few arcseconds north. This object, designated 3C 326 N, has enough gas for star formation, but is being inhibited due to the energy from the radio galaxy nucleus.|$|E

5|$|The Iranian Embassy siege {{took place}} from 30 April to 5 May 1980, after a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>six</b> armed men stormed the Iranian embassy in South Kensington, London. The gunmen, {{members of an}} Iranian Arab group campaigning for Arab {{national}} sovereignty in the southern Iranian region of Khuzestan Province, took 26 people hostage—mostly embassy staff, but also several visitors {{as well as a}} police officer who had been guarding the embassy. They demanded the release of Arab prisoners from prisons in Khuzestan and their own safe passage out of the United Kingdom. Margaret Thatcher's government quickly resolved that safe passage would not be granted, and a siege ensued. Over the following days, police negotiators secured the release of five hostages in exchange for minor concessions, such as the broadcasting of the hostage-takers' demands on British television.|$|E
5|$|The {{assassination}} of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne, {{and his wife}} Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, occurred on 28 June 1914 in Sarajevo when they were mortally wounded by Gavrilo Princip. Princip {{was one of a}} <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>six</b> assassins (five Serbs and one Bosniak) coordinated by Danilo Ilić, a Bosnian Serb {{and a member of the}} Black Hand secret society. The political objective of the assassination was to break off Austria-Hungary's South Slav provinces so they could be combined into a Yugoslavia. The assassins' motives were consistent with the movement that later became known as Young Bosnia. The assassination led directly to the First World War when Austria-Hungary subsequently issued an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Serbia, which was partially rejected. Austria-Hungary then declared war, triggering actions leading to war between most European states.|$|E
5|$|The peloton {{remained}} intact for roughly {{the first half}} of the sixth stage. Luigi Ganna and Carlo Galetti broke away from the pack and made it to the finish in Rome where Ganna then edged out Galetti for the stage victory. During the next stage, a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>six</b> riders lead for the most part before Galetti and Ganna broke away again. The two riders made their way to the finish in Genoa, where a large crowd of spectators came to see the finish. Ganna went on to win his second consecutive stage, while Galetti extended his lead over the rest of the field. The race's eighth stage contained some harsh climbs, most notably the Giovi. The finish of the stage was hotly contested as Galetti, Ganna, and Eberardo Pavesi finished at the same time, with Galetti winning the stage in the end.|$|E

5|$|There are {{different}} {{accounts of the}} rise of Darius to the throne from both Darius himself and Greek historians. The oldest records report a convoluted sequence of events in which Cambyses II lost his mind, murdered his brother Bardiya, and was killed by an infected leg wound. After this, Darius and a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>six</b> nobles traveled to Sikayauvati to kill an usurper, Gaumata, who had taken the throne by pretending to be Bardiya during the true king's absence. Many modern historians believe that Gaumata, in fact, was the true heir Bardiya, with the historical account being altered by Darius to make the coup d'etat appear more legitimate.|$|E
5|$|With {{few other}} options {{available}} to him, the President of the Assembly, Jean Joseph Mounier, accompanied a deputation of market-women into the palace to see the king. A <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>six</b> women nominated by the crowd were escorted into the king's apartment, where they told him of the crowd's privations. The king responded sympathetically, and using all his charm impressed the women {{to the point that}} one of them fainted at his feet. After this brief but pleasant meeting, arrangements were made to disburse some food from the royal stores, with more promised, and some in the crowd felt that their goals had been satisfactorily met. As rain once again began to pelt Versailles, Maillard and a small cluster of market women trooped triumphantly back to Paris.|$|E
5|$|A <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>six</b> Serbian nationalists, {{among them}} Boško Radonjić, placed a home-made {{bomb in the}} home of the Yugoslav {{consulate}} in Chicago in 1975. Radonjić later became the leader of the Westies gang in New York City, where he participated in organized crime and racketeering. He eventually {{became one of the most}} feared gangsters in the New York City underworld, and developed extensive friendships with Vojislav Stanimirović, John Gotti and the Gambino family. After Sammy Gravano turned John Gotti in to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in December 1990, Radonjić was highly suspected to have attempted to fix the trial on John Gotti's behalf. As a result of this, Radonjić was arrested on December 1999 during a spectacular rerouted plane going to Cuba to a lockdown at Miami International Airport when he was tracked down by the FBI. He was arrested in the United States again in January 2000 for further investigation of the 1992 Gotti trial. Upon release in 2001, he left the United States and moved back to Serbia where he lived until his death in 2011. He was also an admirer and long-time friend of Radovan Karadžić until the latter went into hiding in 1996.|$|E
