500|$|Originally set for {{a single}} {{theatrical}} release, the idea to split the book into two parts was suggested by executive producer Lionel Wigram due to what David Heyman called [...] "creative imperative". Heyman initially responded negatively to the idea, but Wigram asked, “No, David. <b>How</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> to do it?”. After rereading the book and discussing it with screenwriter Steve Kloves, he agreed with the division.|$|E
500|$|Trevor Noah also avoided talking {{too much}} about Fox News, as Stewart was {{previously}} known for. [...] "The Daily Show {{was based on an}} emerging 24 hour news cycle, that’s everything it was, that’s what inspired The Daily Show. Now you look at news and it’s changed. It’s no longer predicated around 24 hour news. There are so many different choices. Half of it is online now. Now you’ve got the 'Gawker's, the 'Buzzfeed's. The way people are drawing their news is soundbites and headlines and click-bait links has changed everything. The biggest challenge {{is going to be an}} exciting one I'm sure is <b>how</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> to bring all of that together looking at it from a bigger lens as opposed to just going after one source — which was historically Fox News" [...] Noah said at a press conference before the shows debut.|$|E
500|$|The {{script for}} [...] "Twilight" [...] {{was written by}} Mike Sussman, one of the {{co-producers}} on Enterprise. The producers had considered showing the episode {{later on in the}} series in order to show what could have happened if the Xindi were successful in their attack on Earth, but instead elected to show it earlier in the series to demonstrate the stakes in the storyline during season three. [...] "Twilight" [...] was directed by Robert Duncan McNeill, his third directing credit for the series following [...] "" [...] and [...] "". McNeill had previously starred in [...] as Tom Paris. McNeill was interviewed for the magazine Star Trek Monthly shortly after reading the script for [...] "Twilight" [...] for the first time. He explained that after reading it, he said [...] "Holy crap <b>how</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> to do that?" [...] He explained that the episode would see the Enterprise destroyed but wasn't yet sure how they were going to film certain sequences such as the roof being blown off the bridge and the crew being sucked out into space.|$|E

2500|$|... "A decade ago, {{most people}} thought I was crazy {{when they learned}} of my efforts to save the old part of Jakarta. A few years later, the {{negative}} voices started to disappear, and now many {{people are starting to}} think with me: <b>how</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> to save our city. In the past using the negative sentiment towards the colonial era was often used as an excuse to disregard protests against the demolition of historical buildings. An increasing number of people now see the old colonial buildings as part of their city’s overall heritage rather than focusing on its colonial aspect.", leading Indonesian architect and conservationist Budi Lim said.|$|E
2500|$|Compton was {{evacuated}} {{for severe}} trench foot; Stephen E. Ambrose concluded that Compton witnessing the carnage involving {{two of his}} closest friends, Joe Toye and William Guarnere [...] "unnerved" [...] him. Compton wrote in his autobiography, [...] "...although I was affected by the horrors of Bastogne, I do not believe I was clinically shell shocked, as the series portrays me. In real life, while I was hollering for the medic, {{trying to figure out}} what to do, I remember two distinct thoughts: <b>How</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> to help the wounded guys?...Maybe this is the time the Germans are really going to get us all." ...|$|E

How do you rebuild a military when we have no money? <b>How</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> {{to take care of}} the people? I think this wild goal to have another war in the name of defense is the dangerous thing. The danger is really us overreacting. We need a strong national defense, and we need to only go to war with a declaration of war."

2500|$|All of {{the movie}} themes and mini-games were {{conceived}} by the creative-design team, which they decided the movie themes would have an old B-movie feel. Trowers notes {{the making of the}} mini-games to be [...] "quite an organic process": [...] "Sometimes we'd have a movie and we'd say OK, we want the player to do this in the scene, which is the action we want, so try to think of a game idea for this. But other times we'd be thinking, [...] "Oh, you know what, we got this great idea for a game and these are the essential actions we can get out of it, <b>how</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> to use it in movies?" [...] So it was really a three-way process, {{trying to figure out what}} we could get people to do, what would be fun, how it would fit in the movie—it wasn't just one process of doing it, it had to go both ways." [...] There had also been a few more movie ideas, but they were left out of the game.|$|E
2500|$|Dion {{organized}} and hosted the First International Conference on Federalism in Mont Tremblant in October 1999 to foster {{international support for}} the cause of federalism in Canada. Quebec sovereigntist leaders were granted a prominent role in the conference and used their floor time to denounce Canadian federalism to an international audience to the great annoyance of their federalist host. But Dion's views got a big boost during the closing speech by United States President Bill Clinton. Clinton appeared to echo the Supreme Court Reference, warning that [...] "when a people thinks it should be independent {{in order to have a}} meaningful political existence, serious questions should be asked.... Are minority rights as well as majority rights respected? <b>How</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> to co-operate with our neighbours?". Clinton argued that federalism allows peoples seeking recognition of their identity a way to do so without isolating themselves in a nation-state. The speech laid to rest any doubts about the U.S. position on the legality and desirability of unilateral secession in Quebec.|$|E
