40|$|AbstractLittle {{is known}} about the {{pollination}} biology of the large (c. 230 species) African orchid genus, Eulophia. Here we report the discovery of pollination by <b>flower</b> <b>chafer</b> beetles (Cetoniinae; Scarabaeidae) in two color forms of E. ensata and in E. welwitschii. Both species have congested, capitate inflorescences, traits that are generally associated with pollination by <b>flower</b> <b>chafer</b> beetles in Eulophia and other plant genera. Pollinarium reconfiguration, including pollinarium bending and anther cap retention, in these beetle-pollinated species is slow. Such slow reconfiguration is predicted by Darwin's hypothesis to be a mechanism that limits geitonogamous self-pollination by slow moving beetles. A breeding system experiment conducted on E. welwitschii showed that this species, like most others in the genus, is self-compatible, but is dependent on pollinators for fruit set. As all Eulophia species are non-rewarding, the basis of attraction of beetles to flowers of the study species seems to be the generalized resemblance of their inflorescence in terms of flower arrangement and color to the capitula of sympatric rewarding Asteraceae that are utilized as food or rendezvous sites (or both) by <b>flower</b> <b>chafer</b> beetles...|$|E

5000|$|Gnorimus variabilis (the {{variable}} Chafer) is {{a species}} of scarab beetle belonging to the subfamily Cetoniinae, the <b>flower</b> <b>chafers.</b> It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. [...] The species is native to Europe and is usually found in oak and beech woods or parkland.|$|R
50|$|The C-shaped larvae, called grubs, are {{pale yellow}} or white. Most adult beetles are nocturnal, {{although}} the <b>flower</b> <b>chafers</b> (Cetoniinae) and many leaf chafers (Rutelinae) are active during the day. The grubs mostly live underground or under debris, so are {{not exposed to}} sunlight. Many scarabs are scavengers that recycle dung, carrion, or decaying plant material. Others, such as the Japanese beetle, are devastating agricultural pests.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of our studies on the preferences of the <b>flower</b> <b>chafer,</b> Protaetia speciosissima (Scopoli, 1786). The studies were carried out in 2009 - 2010 in the Forest Districts of Hajnówka, Krotoszyn, Łochów, Pińczów, and Puławy, located in various regions of Poland. Barrier traps consisting of a Moericke's trap and a Malaise's trap combined with a barrier of fine net were used to collect beetles. Traps were installed at two heights in over 100 years old oak stands, with the upper level in the canopy layer (mean height of 20. 5 m) and the lower level adjacent to the tree trunk (mean height of 4, 5 m). During two-year study, we collected a total of 328 specimens of P. speciosissima, 299 from the upper- and 29 from the lower forest layer. Thus, we confirmed strong preferences of the adult of P. speciosissima for the canopy layer in oak stands. Furthermore, our observations on phenology indicate that the second half of June and all of July are the months with the highest population density of P. speciosissima. This paper also proposes modes of action for conservation of the species. Przemysław Szmi...|$|E
40|$|The {{implementation}} of conservation actions requires a reliable assessment of presence and/or abundance of targeted species. This is particularly difficult for rare and elusive species. In this study {{the use of}} bottle traps {{and the effects of}} two potential baits in relation to height in the trees were tested to detect presence and assess abundance of stag beetles (Lucanidae) and flower chafers (Scarabaeidae, Cetoniinae), an important component of forest biodiversity. The study was carried out in a flood-plain forest of northern Italy. Forty-eight handcrafted traps were assigned to two height categories (1. 5 – 2  m and 10 – 20  m) and three kinds of bait: (i) red wine, white wine and sugar, (ii) red wine, beer and mashed banana, (iii) no bait, as control. Fieldwork lasted 8 weeks, with 32 surveys, from May to July. Overall, we recorded 399 captures of the following species: Dorcus parallelipipedus, Lucanus cervus, Cetonia aurata, Protaetia speciosissima, P. affinis, P. morio and P. cuprea. Traps baited with red wine, white wine and sugar showed the highest detection probabilities for all the species. A clear preference for the canopy layer (traps between 10 and 20  m high) was shown by all species except for D. parallelipipedus which was mostly captured between 1. 5 and 2   m of height. The study period was long enough to improve ecological knowledge on species phenology, but not enough to include the whole phenology for all of them.

50|$|Cotinis mutabilis, {{also known}} as the figeater beetle (also green fruit beetle or fig beetle), {{is a member of the}} scarab beetle family. It belongs to the {{subfamily}} Cetoniinae, comprising a group of beetles commonly called <b>flower</b> <b>chafers</b> since many of them feed on pollen, nectar, or petals. Its habitat is primarily the southwestern United States and Mexico. Figeater beetles are often mistaken for green June beetles (Cotinis nitida) and occasionally Japanese beetles (Popillia japonica), which occur in the eastern US; however, they are not considered to be an important pest because they do not damage lawns as larvae and trees as much as their eastern cousins.|$|R
50|$|The fiddler beetle was {{originally}} described by Anglo Irish naturalist Edward Donovan as Cetonia australasiae in his 1805 work An Epitome of the Natural History of the Insects of New Holland, New Zealand, New Guinea, Otaheite, and other Islands in the Indian, Southern, and Pacific Oceans. It was reclassified in {{and became the}} type species of the new genus Eupoecila by German entomologist Hermann Burmeister in 1842. Within the scarab family, it {{is a member of}} the subfamily Cetoniinae, commonly known as <b>flower</b> <b>chafers.</b> These beetles are strong flyers and can fly without moving the elytra; they spend much of the time searching for nectar and plant exudates.|$|R
50|$|In this context, {{a bottle}} trap {{is a type}} of baited {{arboreal}} insect trap for collecting either prized or harmful frugivorous beetles, especially <b>flower</b> beetles, leaf <b>chafers</b> and longhorn beetles as well as wasps and other unwanted flying insects.|$|R
40|$|Hemocytes are {{key players}} in the immune {{response}} against pathogens in insects. However, the hemocyte types and their functions in the white-spotted <b>flower</b> <b>chafers,</b> Protaetia brevitarsis seulensis (Kolbe), are not known. In this study, we used various microscopes, molecular probes, and flow cytometric analyses to characterize the hemocytes in P. brevitarsis seulensis. The circulating hemocytes were classified based on their size, morphology, and dye-staining properties into six types, including granulocytes, plasmatocytes, oenocytoids, spherulocytes, prohemocytes, and adipohemocytes. The percentages of circulating hemocyte types were as follows: 13 % granulocytes, 20 % plasmatocytes, 1 % oenocytoids, 5 % spherulocytes, 17 % prohemocytes, and 44 % adipohemocytes. Next, we identified the professional phagocytes, granulocytes, which mediate encapsulation and phagocytosis of pathogens. The granulocytes were immunologically or morphologically activated and phagocytosed potentially hazardous substances in vivo. In addition, we showed that the phagocytosis by granulocytes is associated with autophagy, and that the activation of autophagy could be an efficient way to eliminate pathogens in this system. We also observed a high accumulation of autophagic vacuoles in activated granulocytes, which altered their shape and led to autophagic cell death. Finally, the granulocytes underwent mitotic division thus maintaining their number in vivo...|$|R
