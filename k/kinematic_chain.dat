40|$|In {{order to}} find a {{systematic}} approach to aid the creative design of mechanisms, this thesis proposes a unified structural synthesis method for planar <b>kinematic</b> <b>chains</b> and mechanisms with simple and multiple joints, characterized by effectiveness, automation and human-machine interaction, and develops the atlas databases containing all the topological graphs for these <b>kinematic</b> <b>chains</b> and mechanisms with different numbers of links, classified by their structural characteristics. Based on the classified atlas databases, the creative design of several kinds of mechanisms is also conducted to verify {{the usefulness of the}} method. The overall structure of the thesis is as follows. (1) In chapter 2, the representation models of planar <b>kinematic</b> <b>chains</b> with simple joints, multiple joints and geared joints are presented and the relationships between these models are revealed. (2) In chapter 3, the relationships of contracted graphs of planar non-fractionated <b>kinematic</b> <b>chains</b> and their link assortment arrays are revealed first. Then a fully-automatic method for the synthesis of the contracted graphs of planar non-fractionated <b>kinematic</b> <b>chains</b> is proposed. With the method, the complete families of non-fractionated contracted graphs and of valid contracted graphs with up to eight basic loops and all possible degrees of freedom are synthesized and obtained for the first time. (3) In chapter 4, a general method is proposed to synthesize planar non-fractionated <b>kinematic</b> <b>chains</b> and mechanisms based on the obtained contracted graphs. The method is fully-automatic and designer-friendly, and planar non-fractionated <b>kinematic</b> <b>chains</b> and mechanisms with up to 19 links are synthesized. Moreover, the classified atlas databases for these <b>kinematic</b> <b>chains</b> and mechanisms are also established. (4) In chapter 5, based on the structure characteristics of fractionated <b>kinematic</b> <b>chains,</b> a general synthesis equation of planar fractionated <b>kinematic</b> <b>chains</b> is proposed first. Then an automatic method is proposed to synthesize planar fractionated <b>kinematic</b> <b>chains</b> by the combination of planar non-fractionated <b>kinematic</b> <b>chains,</b> and the whole family of planar fractionated <b>kinematic</b> <b>chains</b> with up to seven basic loops is synthesized for the first time. (5) In chapter 6, based on the new bicolor topological graph and its inter-convertible characteristics with that of simple joint <b>kinematic</b> <b>chains,</b> an automatic method is proposed to synthesize multiple joint <b>kinematic</b> <b>chains</b> from simple joint <b>kinematic</b> <b>chains</b> and their classified atlas databases. The whole family of multiple joint <b>kinematic</b> <b>chains</b> with up to 16 links is synthesized {{for the first time and}} corresponding classified atlas databases are also established. (6) In chapter 7, based on the structural synthesis and classified atlas databases of <b>kinematic</b> <b>chains</b> with simple and multiple joints, a creative design method is proposed to obtain all the feasible mechanisms for a specified task from the topological graphs in the classified atlas databases subject to design constraints. The creative design of road tractors, hydraulic robots and forging manipulators is conducted as examples, and a number of novel mechanisms are obtained for the first time together with the widely used ones...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. At present, the {{research}} of isomorphism identification of planar <b>kinematic</b> <b>chains</b> has reached a great improvement, however, most of the methods are proved so complex, inefficient as well as unreliable that {{the research}} is hindered and restricted a lot. At the same time, especially {{with the appearance of}} the planar <b>kinematic</b> <b>chains</b> with multiple joints, there is less research about the methods. Hence, in the paper, based on the method of <b>kinematic</b> <b>chains</b> with characteristic arrays, one method of isomorphism identification of <b>kinematic</b> <b>chains</b> with single joint as well as multiple joints is proposed presently. What is more, a software based on this new method proposed is developed with Visual Basic.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an extensive {{study of the}} kinematics of parallel manipulators. The latter are considered here as a subset of a more general class of <b>kinematic</b> <b>chains</b> called complex <b>kinematic</b> <b>chains</b> which are defined as chains in which there exists at least one link having a degree of connectivity {{greater than or equal}} to three. The degree of connectivity of a link is defined here as the number of rigid bodies that are directly attached to this link by kinematic pairs. The first portion of the thesis is devoted to the study of simple <b>kinematic</b> <b>chains</b> which are the basic elements from which complex <b>kinematic</b> <b>chains,</b> and hence parallel manipulators, are constructed. The analysis of complex <b>kinematic</b> <b>chains</b> is then pursued through their graph representation and through the derivation of the associated Jacobian matrix. The three types of singularities pertaining to this class of <b>kinematic</b> <b>chains</b> are identified using the latter concept. They are illustrated with some examples. This also leads to an unambiguous definition of parallel manipulators based on their graph representation. Parallel manipulators are then analyzed in detail. The analysis includes the solution of the direct and inverse kinematic problems, the velocity and acceleration inversions and an investigation of the singularities. These problems are discussed in a general framework before special cases are introduced. The kinematic design optimization of parallel manipulators is then undertaken using some performance criteria such as symmetry, workspace, local dexterity and global dexterity. A new performance index called global conditioning index (GCI) is also defined. Finally, the kinematic inversion of redundant parallel manipulators is approached as a local dexterity maximization problem. The concept of trajectory map is introduced and an algorithm for the generation of smooth trajectories is given...|$|R
