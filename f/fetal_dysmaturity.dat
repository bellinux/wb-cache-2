40|$|Although post-term {{pregnancy}} {{is associated with}} an increased incidence of fetal distress, oligohydramnios, fetal macrosomia, <b>fetal</b> <b>dysmaturity,</b> and perinatal mortality, as many as 80 % of post-term fetuses appear completely normal. The authors of this article discuss the three sub-groups of post-term pregnancies, and deal with the diagnosis and antepartum and intrapartum management of the condition. Recommendations and a protocol for management are provided...|$|E
40|$|Study of 108 {{samples of}} amniotic fluid {{obtained}} between 28 and 42 weeks' gestation from 101 patients revealed that in normal pregnancies the creatinine concentration, lecithin/sphingomyelin (L/S) ratio {{and percentage of}} fat cells correlated better with the gestational age of the newborn [...] assessed by clinical criteria [...] than did the bilirubin and sodium concentrations. A creatinine concentration of 1. 75 mg/dL or more, an L/S ratio of 4 or more and a fat cell percentage of 10 or more correlated significantly with a gestational age of 37 weeks or more. In abnormal pregnancies (those with obstetric or medical complications, or both) the mean creatinine concentration in the amniotic fluid was significantly less than expected for gestational age in <b>fetal</b> <b>dysmaturity</b> and greater than expected when the mother had diabetes. The mean L/S ratio in the amniotic fluid was elevated when the mother had hypertension or smoked and in cases of <b>fetal</b> <b>dysmaturity</b> or long interval between rupture of the membranes and delivery, whereas it was significantly lower than normal when the mother had diabetes. The mean bilirubin concentration in the amniotic fluid was significantly lower than normal when the mother had hypertension. When the mother had diabetes, maturity of the fetal lung, liver, skin and brain appeared to be delayed, according to the values for the amniotic fluid constituents...|$|E
