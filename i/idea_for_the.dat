5|$|When {{planning}} an episode, the writers {{started with the}} <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> episode and determined the main story arc.

5|$|A dwarf, in the Dungeons & Dragons (D) fantasy roleplaying game, is a {{humanoid}} race, one of {{the primary}} races available for player characters.

Tolkien's novel The Lord of the Rings (1954-1955), and has been used in D and its predecessor Chainmail since the early 1970s. Variations from the standard dwarf archetype of a short and stout demihuman are commonly called subraces, of which {{there are more than a}} dozen across many different rule sets and campaign settings.|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} {{success of the}} Shakespeare Gallery, many wanted to take credit.

James Northcote claimed that his Death of Wat Tyler and Murder of the Princes in the Tower had motivated Boydell to start the project. However, according to Winifred Friedman, who has researched the Boydell Gallery, it was probably Joshua Reynolds's Royal Academy lectures on the superiority of history painting that influenced Boydell the most.|$|E
