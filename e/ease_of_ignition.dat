50|$|Several {{studies in}} the 1980s tested {{ignition}} in whole pieces of furniture with different upholstery and filling types, including different flame retardant formulations. In particular, they looked at maximum heat release and time to maximum heat release, two key indicators of fire danger. These studies found {{that the type of}} fabric covering had a large influence on <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>ignition,</b> that cotton fillings were much less flammable than polyurethane foam fillings, and that an interliner material substantially reduced the <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>ignition.</b> They also found that although some flame retardant formulations decreased the <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>ignition,</b> the most basic formulation that met TB 117 had very little effect. In one of the studies, foam fillings that met TB 117 had equivalent ignition times as the same foam fillings without flame retardants. A report from the Proceedings of the Polyurethane Foam Association also showed no benefit in open-flame and cigarette tests with foam cushions treated with flame retardants to meet TB 117. However, other scientists support this open-flame test.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Forestry, 1989 This {{study was}} an {{examination}} of forest floor characteristics and related fire behavior in the northern range of California's coastal redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) forests. Experimental fires, {{during the summer and}} fall of 1986, in stands of redwood located in Redwood National Park, determined the fuel bed characteristics (fuel depth, load, and moisture) and local weather conditions (temperature and relative humidity) necessary to sustain a low intensity ground fire. Elevation and topographic position, and how they influence fuel moisture, emerged as the determining factors related to <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> fire <b>ignition</b> and rates <b>of</b> spread. Fuel depth and load appeared to affect the intensity and duration of the fires and rate of spread. Once favorable burning conditions were determined, a burning window was identified. The lower threshold conditions were relative humidity less than 40 percent and temperature greater than 20 ??C. The best time of day for burning was mid-afternoon. This burning window was limited to a few day per month. Preliminary equations to predict flame length were developed using multiple regression and compared with Rothermel's Fuel Model " 8 ". Linear regression analysis determined that the created prediction equation was a better predictor of flame length than Rothermel's Model...|$|R
40|$|We {{measure the}} time to {{explosion}} of 12. 7 mm diameter spheres of ultra fine TATB and PBX- 9502 (95 wt% TATB, 5 wt% Kel-F 800) at 85. 0, 92. 5, and 98. 0 percent of theoretical maximum density (TMD) in confined and unconfined configurations and at several elevated temperatures with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) One Dimensional Time to Explosion (ODTX) apparatus. Time to explosion data {{provide insight into the}} relative <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> thermal <b>ignition</b> and allow for the calibration of kinetic parameters. The measurements show that PBX- 9502 is more thermally stable than ultra fine TATB, that unconfined samples are slightly more thermally stable than confined ones, and that lower density samples are more thermally stable than higher density ones. 'Go/no go' data at the lowest temperatures yield an experimental measurement of the critical temperature, which is the temperature at which an explosive can be heated indefinitely without undergoing self-heating and concomitant rapid and violent decomposition. Critical temperatures ranges for 12. 7 mm diameter spheres of 98 % TMD ultra fine TATB and PBX- 9502 are 213 - 230 C and 234 - 239 C, respectively. Experimental data are modeled with ALE 3 D and kinetic parameters are determined. These kinetic parameters, when coupled with thermal property data, provide good prediction of {{the time to}} explosion...|$|R

50|$|Some fire-safe {{polymers}} naturally exhibit {{an intrinsic}} resistance to decomposition, {{while others are}} synthesized by incorporating fire-resistant additives and fillers. Current research in developing fire-safe polymers is focused on modifying various properties of the polymers such as <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>ignition,</b> rate of heat release, {{and the evolution of}} smoke and toxic gases. Standard methods for testing polymer flammability vary among countries; in the United States common fire tests include the UL 94 small-flame test, the ASTM E 84 Steiner Tunnel, and the ASTM E 622 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) smoke chamber. Research on developing fire-safe polymers with more desirable properties is concentrated at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and at the Federal Aviation Administration where a long-term research program on developing fire-safe polymers was begun in 1995. The Center for UMass/Industry Research on Polymers (CUMIRP) was established in 1980 in Amherst, MA as a concentrated cluster of scientists from both academia and industry for the purpose of polymer science and engineering research.|$|E

40|$|The main {{challenge}} for the wide spread use of hydrogen in fuel cell systems is the safety concerns due to its <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> leaking, low-energy <b>ignition,</b> large flammability range, high buoyancy and diffusion rate in air. To alleviate concern of explosion during experiments, scientists are using helium as a stimulant for hydrogen safety studies. However, the equivalent behavior between the two gases only relies on numerical or experimental results, and the similarity is not connected by a theoretical correlation. This thesis assesses similarity relations using helium for hydrogen studies and develops a theoretical helium plume model. Meanwhile, {{a case study of}} leakage in fuel cell vehicles is simulated by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The accuracy of three different correlations, i. e., equal volumetric flow rate, equal buoyancy and equal concentration between helium and hydrogen was compared by CFD simulations validated by helium experiment in a 1 / 4 sub-scale residential garage model. The accuracy of these different methods at different leakage rate, stage of release, ventilation method and location was discussed. An updated theoretical helium plume model was validated by PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) experiment and CFD. It is found that the new model could be used in estimating the plume size and velocity. In the case study of hydrogen leakage inside a FCV (Fuel Cell Vehicle), ventilation and sunroof show critical effect to reduce the level of hydrogen concentration accumulation...|$|R

The different fire models employed in the two tests could be responsible for this discrepancy. As the former test has been validated by large-scale evalua-tions the use of ISO 5657 for the assessment of the burning behaviour of carpets is not to be recommended. Incorporation of the measurement of smoke emission and heat output in the NBS Flooring Radiant Panel, in addition to spread of flame, allows the assess-ment of additional flammability parameters using one, validated, fire model. All these three flammability parameters were highly significantly correlated. There was no correlation between the smoke emission results in the NBS Flooring Radiant Panel and in the NBS Smoke Density Chamber, probably because of the different fire models employed...|$|E
