(1964), was reached later that summer. To repair her public image, Monroe engaged in several publicity ventures, including interviews for Life and Cosmopolitan and her first photo shoot for Vogue. For Vogue, she and photographer Bert Stern collaborated for two series of photographs, one a standard fashion editorial and another of her posing nude, which were both later published posthumously with the title The Last Sitting. In the last weeks of her life, she was also planning on starring in a biopic of Jean Harlow.|$|E
5|$|The 18th {{century was}} indeed {{the golden age of}} the chair, {{especially}} in France and England (including Colonial America), between which there was considerable <b>give</b> <b>and</b> take of ideas. Even Diderot could not refrain from writing of them in his Encyclopédie. The typical Louis Seize chair, oval-backed and ample of seat, with descending arms and round-reeded legs, covered in Beauvais or some such gay tapestry woven with Boucher or Watteau-like scenes, is a very gracious object, in which the period reached its high-water mark. The Empire brought in squat and squabby shapes, comfortable enough no doubt, but entirely destitute of inspiration. English Empire chairs were often heavier and more sombre than those of French design.|$|E
40|$|About the {{expression}} of <b>giving</b> <b>and</b> accepting in Japanese, the differences between honorific and unhonorific expression of <b>giving</b> <b>and</b> accepting verbs {{are very difficult to}} Chinese learners. It's said about {{the expression}} of <b>giving</b> <b>and</b> accepting, that there are seven <b>giving</b> <b>and</b> accepting verbs and these verbs have a complicated system like honorific and unhonorific expression, inside and outside expression in Japanese, but Chinese is very easy and just has one verb without any systems by okutukeiitirou. In fact, because there are honorific and unhonorific expression in Japanese, there is a direction of {{up and down in the}} relationship between <b>giving</b> <b>and</b> accepting. On the other hand, in Chinese, the verb for <b>giving</b> <b>and</b> accepting doesn't have a difference between honorific and unhonorific expressions, so maybe there is no direction up and down just from the verb. In this paper, comparison of Japanese and Chinese about the direction of up and down in the relationship between <b>giving</b> <b>and</b> accepting will be looked at with a focus on the verbs of <b>giving</b> <b>and</b> accepting in Japanese...|$|R

This article discusses the challenges associ-ated with designing <b>giving</b> <b>and</b> volunteering surveys, suggests strategies for improving measures of <b>giving</b> <b>and</b> volunteering, and shows how they were applied in the design of Canada’s 1997 National Survey of <b>Giving,</b> Volunteering <b>and</b> Participating. Surveys are frequently used to collect data about <b>giving</b> <b>and</b> volunteering; however, the quality of the data is seldom known, and the measurement chal-lenges inherent in such surveys are not well recognized. For example, the inability of respondents to accurately recall past behaviors introduces both random errors and probable downward biases to estimates of <b>giving</b> <b>and</b> vol-unteering. On the other hand, the tendency of some respondents to provide socially desirable responses may lead to an overreporting of <b>giving</b> <b>and</b> volun-teering. The extent to which these two potential sources of bias may offset one another is seldom known and varies from survey to survey according to the particular way in which <b>giving</b> <b>and</b> volunteering are measured.

So if there's the direction of up and down in the relationship between <b>giving</b> <b>and</b> accepting. So if there's the direction of up and down in the dialogues, the honorific expression like 「～te a ge ru/te sa shi a ge ru」「～te ku da sa ru」must be used frequently.

As a result, it's clear that although in Japanese there's the direction of up and down, the direction is influneced by the idea of consideration.
