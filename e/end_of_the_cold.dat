5|$|A reduced fear of {{persecution}} encouraged the resistance movements; anti-integration protests accompanied high-profile visits to East Timor {{including that of}} Pope John Paul II in 1989. The <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War removed much of the justification for western support of Indonesia's occupation.|$|E
5|$|At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War, the Army saw further {{drawdowns}} and {{reductions in}} spending. The 29th Infantry Division was retained, however 2nd Brigade was inactivated {{in favor of}} assets from the inactivating 26th Infantry Division, which was redesignated the 26th Brigade, 29th Infantry Division.|$|E
5|$|During his presidency, Reagan pursued {{policies}} that reflected his personal belief in individual freedom, brought changes domestically, {{both to the}} U.S. economy and expanded military, {{and contributed to the}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War. Termed the Reagan Revolution, his presidency would reinvigorate American morale, reinvigorate the American economy and reduce American reliance upon government.|$|E

25|$|In 1995 {{there had}} been no further sales <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cray-3, and <b>the</b> <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War made it {{unlikely}} anyone would buy enough Cray-4s to offer a return on the development funds. The company ran out of money and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy March 24, 1995.|$|R
5|$|In the 1990s, the {{discovery}} of wing cracking led to the quick retirement of all Hunter F.58As. The <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War also allowed Switzerland to retire its Hunters earlier than expected; the Hunter was completely withdrawn from Swiss service in 1994. The Swiss Air Force lost the capability to carry out air-to-ground operations when the Hunters were withdrawn from service.|$|E
5|$|No {{military}} operations {{were conducted by}} NATO during the Cold War. Following the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War, the first operations, Anchor Guard in 1990 and Ace Guard in 1991, were prompted by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Airborne early warning aircraft were sent to provide coverage of southeastern Turkey, and later a quick-reaction force was deployed to the area.|$|E

50|$|Although {{this is more}} of a {{digression}} from <b>the</b> {{main course}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book, he links the 1995 Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway with the 9/11 suicide attacks, and repeats the (not unusual) opinions of military affairs critics <b>of</b> how <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> terrorist organisations was possibly a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War.|$|R
50|$|The AIM-152 AAAM was a {{long-range}} air-to-air missile {{developed by the}} United States. The program went through a protracted development stage but was never adopted by the United States Navy, due to <b>the</b> <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War and <b>the</b> reduction in threat of its perceived primary target, Soviet supersonic bombers. Development was cancelled in 1992.|$|R
5|$|After the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War and the Dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia and the Central Asian republics were {{weakened}} {{economically and}} faced declines in GDP. Post-Soviet states underwent economic reforms and privatisation. The process of Eurasian integration began {{immediately after the}} break-up of the Soviet Union to salvage economic ties with Post-Soviet states {{through the creation of}} the Commonwealth of Independent States on 8 December 1991 by the presidents of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia.|$|E
5|$|At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War, the FPÖ {{became more}} eurosceptic, which was {{reflected}} by its change from pan-Germanism to Austrian patriotism. The party's {{opposition to the}} European Union grew stronger in the 1990s. The FPÖ opposed Austria's joining the EU in 1994, and promoted a popular initiative against {{the replacement of the}} Austrian Schilling with the Euro in 1998, but to no avail. Owing to perceived differences between Turkish and European culture, the party opposes the accession of Turkey to the EU; it has declared that should this happen, Austria must immediately leave the EU.|$|E
5|$|At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War, the US Army {{considered}} new {{options for}} the integration and organization of active duty, Army Reserve and Army National Guard units in training and deployment. Two division headquarters activated in the active duty component for training National Guard units. The 7th Infantry Division and the 24th Infantry Division headquarters were selected. The subordinate brigades of the divisions did not activate so {{they could not be}} deployed as divisions, however their active duty status would allow the headquarters to focus on the national guard units under them full-time.|$|E
50|$|From 1983 to 1992, Hyland was <b>the</b> editor <b>of</b> Foreign Affairs magazine.

With <b>the</b> <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War, Hyland advocated a period of American disengagement with world affairs.|$|R
50|$|When parent {{corporation}} The Donning Company folded Starblaze Graphics, Doran self-published {{under the}} Aria Press imprint, reprinting earlier work and creating new work. <b>The</b> <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War necessitated some minor revision to political references in early chapters.

50|$|Both studies {{reported}} in 1989, {{and almost immediately}} were rendered obsolete by <b>the</b> <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War. <b>The</b> Navy suddenly faced <b>the</b> disappearance <b>of</b> its greatest threat, and <b>the</b> prospect <b>of</b> budget cuts as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peace dividend. Interest waned in big new designs like the SOCS ship; the Destroyer Variant (DDV) program of December 1991 {{was intended as a}} stopgap, <b>the</b> final development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Burke class destroyer.|$|R
5|$|Cheney {{publicly}} {{expressed concern}} that nations such as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, could acquire nuclear components {{after the collapse of}} the Soviet Union in 1991. The <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War, the fall of the Soviet Union, and the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact obliged the first Bush Administration to reevaluate the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO's) purpose and makeup. Cheney believed that NATO should remain the foundation of European security relationships and that it would remain important to the United States in the long term; he urged the alliance to lend more assistance to the new democracies in Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Following the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War in 1989, the US {{government}} conducted careful {{restructuring of}} national priorities {{and of the}} defense establishment. Fort Lewis, ideally located {{to act as a}} base for mobilization and power projection into the Pacific region, was one of few military bases that did not downsize with the US military overall. Thus, while most of the Army was downsizing, Fort Lewis began to grow, however, several tenant units such as the 9th Infantry Division were downsized.|$|E
5|$|Following the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War {{there have}} been a number of {{attempts}} to curb military activity or even abolish the armed forces altogether. A notable referendum on the subject, launched by an anti-militarist group, was held on 26 November 1989. It was defeated with about two thirds of the voters against the proposal. A similar referendum, called for before, but held shortly after the 11 September attacks in the US, was defeated by over 78% of voters.|$|E
50|$|Marquardt Corporation was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> few {{aeronautical}} engineering firms that was dedicated almost solely to <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ramjet engine. Marquardt designs were developed through the 1940s into the 1960s, but the ramjet never {{became a major}} design and the company turned to other fields in the 1970s. They suffered a particularly bad financial crisis with <b>the</b> <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War, and went bankrupt in the 1990s.|$|R
2500|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War ended {{two years}} after Kennedy's book appeared, validating his thesis {{regarding}} the Soviet Union, but leaving the United States as the sole superpower and, apparently, at <b>the</b> peak <b>of</b> its economy. Nau (2001) contends that Kennedy's [...] "realist" [...] model of international politics underestimates <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> national, domestic identities or <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War and <b>the</b> growing convergence <b>of</b> democracy and markets resulting from the democratic peace that followed.|$|R
40|$|Dutch {{politics}} has experienced quite some change since the 1980 s. In the past, {{these changes are}} due to contextual developments like <b>the</b> <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War and <b>the</b> broadening and deepening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EU. At the same time Dutch society has changed {{as well as its}} socio-economic profile and performance. This special issue examines <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> these changes on <b>the</b> working <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dutch political system. In a nutshell it signifies a farewell to consociationalism...|$|R
5|$|Following the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War, III Corps {{headquarters}} itself saw {{no major}} contingencies, however it saw numerous units under its command deploy to contingencies around the world. III Corps units {{were sent to}} Grenada, Panama, Honduras, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Iraq. In the fall of 1990, two 6th Cavalry Brigade (Air Combat) units deployed to Iraq during Operation Desert Shield. One of those units was 2nd Battalion, 158th Aviation Regiment, a Chinook battalion from Fort Hood. Other corps units also provided humanitarian support for Operation Restore Hope in Somalia. III Corps elements supported Operation Joint Endeavor in Bosnia and Herzegovina as well.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{aftermath}} of the Cold War is not always easily erased, as many of the economic and social tensions that were exploited to fuel Cold War competition in parts of the Third World remain acute. The breakdown of state control {{in a number of areas}} formerly ruled by communist governments produced new civil and ethnic conflicts, particularly in the former Yugoslavia. In Central and Eastern Europe, the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War has ushered in an era of economic growth and an increase in the number of liberal democracies, while in other parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, independence was accompanied by state failure.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Army leaders {{including}} General Eric Shinseki began shifting the Army force toward brigade centered operations. All separate brigades had been inactivated in the 1990s {{as part of}} the U.S. Army's drawdown following the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War. These inactivations, along with subsequent reorganization of U.S. Army divisions, saw several divisional brigades stationed in bases that were far from the division's headquarters and support units. These brigades had difficulty operating without support from higher headquarters.|$|E
50|$|Intended {{for sales}} to the US Army and Canadian Army, the system was {{developed}} and produced at a new facility in Quebec. In spite <b>of</b> successfully developing <b>the</b> system, {{by the time it}} was ready for service <b>the</b> <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War led <b>the</b> US Army to cancel its orders, after Oerlikon invested over CHF 1 billion in the project. A small number of vehicles, many <b>of</b> them <b>the</b> development prototypes, entered service with the Canadian Army.|$|R
50|$|Formed in 1986 by vocalist/programmer Heiki Sillaste (aka Mouth 392), {{the project}} was {{considered}} Toronto's answer to the established Vancouver-based industrial acts like Skinny Puppy, and Front Line Assembly. Digital Poodle's sound can be best described as house/techno mixed with European Electronic body music (EBM) and occasionally skirting experimental and ambient soundscapes. Sillaste's lyrical themes and choice of audio sampling typically covered <b>the</b> <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War, {{as well as the}} following political independence struggles in the Baltic states and Eastern Europe.|$|R

5|$|Since the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War, India has {{increased}} its economic, strategic, and military co-operation with the United States and the European Union. In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons {{at the time and}} was not party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India's nuclear technology and commerce. As a consequence, India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state. India subsequently signed co-operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada.|$|E
5|$|The British Army {{has seen}} action in major wars between the world's great powers, {{including}} the Seven Years' War, the Napoleonic Wars, the Crimean War and the First and Second World Wars. Britain's victories in these decisive wars {{allowed it to}} influence world events and establish itself {{as one of the}} world's leading military and economic powers. Since the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War the British Army has deployed to a number of conflict zones, often as part of an expeditionary force, a coalition force or part of a United Nations peacekeeping operation.|$|E
5|$|The <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War and {{the signing}} of the CFE Treaty gave rise to a {{requirement}} for Germany {{to reduce the size of}} its armed forces, including the number of combat aircraft. To meet this need, one of the Marinefliegers Tornado wings was disbanded on 1 January 1994; its aircraft replaced the Phantoms of a Luftwaffe reconnaissance wing. The second wing was enlarged and continued in the anti-shipping, reconnaissance and anti-radar roles until it was disbanded in 2005 with its aircraft and duties passed on to the Luftwaffe.|$|E
50|$|The seven-month-long 1990 American tour {{acknowledged}} <b>the</b> <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War. <b>The</b> tour starred Carolee Carmello, John Herrera, and Stephen Bogardus and {{was staged}} by Des McAnuff. Playwright Robert Coe worked with McAnuff on revising the show, mostly using the Nelson script and restoring most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original song order from <b>the</b> British version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> musical and deleting the new songs {{written for the}} American version. A UK tour starring Rebecca Storm and mostly based on the London production, was a bigger success.|$|R
5000|$|RAF Edzell reopened in 1960, forming part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States Navy global High Frequency Direction Finding (HFDF) network, used {{to track}} various targets around the world. Up to 3,000 {{personnel}} {{were said to}} have been stationed at RAF Edzell. <b>The</b> <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War, and advances in technology rendered the HF network obsolete, and the station closed in October 1997, by which time staffing levels had fallen to 300 local, and 700 military personnel.
