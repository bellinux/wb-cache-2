40|$|A {{rotating}} {{disk electrode}} has been designed, fabricated, and tested {{for use in}} high temperature molten salt systems to determine mass-transport parameters that {{have been difficult to}} obtain hitherto due to experimental difficulties. The design incorporates a centrifugally cast and machined solid gold cone soldered to an Inconel shaft, which fits snugly in a precision-machined high purity alumina sheath. A thermal <b>expansion</b> <b>seal</b> obtained when the electrode is heated to the experimental temperature prevents eepage of electrolyte between the gold and insulator. Preliminary tests have shown good performance. Since the development of the theory of the rotating disk electrode (RDE) by Levich 1 in 1942, practical extensions of the theory and electrode design have appeared, making the RDE a powerful tool in electrochemical investigations. Ex-cellent comprehensive treatises 2 ' 3 are available, that deal with the application f the theory to different systems. De-spite some of its unique analytical capabilities the RDE has found little use in the study of high temperature molten sal...|$|E

40|$|A new {{repository}} {{waste package}} (WP) concept for {{spent nuclear fuel}} (SNF) is being investigated that uses depleted uranium (DU) to improve performance and reduce the uncertainties of geological disposal of SNF. The WP would be filled with SNF and then filled with depleted uranium (DU) ({approximately} 0. 2 wt % {sup 235 }U) dioxide (UO{sub 2 }) or DU silicate-glass beads. Fission products and actinides can not escape the SNF UO{sub 2 } crystals until the UO{sub 2 } dissolves or is transformed into other chemical species. After WP failure, the DU fill material slows dissolution by three mechanisms: (1) saturation of AT groundwater with DU and suppression of SNF dissolution, (2) maintenance of chemically reducing conditions in the WP that minimize SNF solubility by sacrificial oxidation of DU from the + 4 valence state, and (3) evolution of DU to lower-density hydrated uranium silicates. The fill <b>expansion</b> <b>seals</b> the WP from water flow. The DU also isotopically exchanges with SNF uranium as the SNF degrades to reduce long-term nuclear-criticality concerns...|$|R

50|$|Another {{possibility}} of seal construction is the compression seal. This type of glass-to-metal seal {{can be used}} to feed through the wall of a metal container.

40|$|In this diploma thesis, the {{archived}} {{documents of}} Franziscean Land Cadastre is presented, which {{we used to}} analyse the spatial characteristics in the 19 th century for {{the case of the}} area in the cadastral community of Postojna. A brief introduction about the history of land cadastre in Slovenia is followed by the presentation of results of comparative analysis, where the situation of land use was analysed from the perspective of plot’s structure and land use patterns. Here we compared the situation of land use as it was at the time of establishment of the Franziscean cadastre with the situation as it is evident from the current official data about the land. For the purpose of land use change analyses we compared the land use data of the Franziscean land cadastre with the current cadastral land use data obtained from the official land cadastre and with the land use data about the actual land use from the agricultural and forest land use records of the agricultural ministry. The results of the analytical work confirmed the assumption that visible changes have occurred in the study area in the past two centuries. In addition to the changes observed by analysing the land plot’s structure, where the number of land plots has increased, we also observed immense land use changes in the studied period. Comparison of data on actual land use from the year 2013 with the data about the cadastral land use from the Franziscean cadastre has primarily shown the reduction of agricultural land, where new built-up areas have appeared (<b>expansion</b> <b>sealing)</b> and, on the other hand, notable process of overgrowing of the agricultural land is evident. ...|$|R

40|$|Bridge {{expansion}} joints, if {{not properly}} designed, constructed, and maintained, {{often lead to}} the deterioration of critical substructure elements. Strip <b>seal</b> <b>expansion</b> joints consisting of a steel extrusion and neoprene gland are one type of expansion joint and are commonly used by the Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT). Strip <b>seal</b> <b>expansion</b> joints are susceptible to tears and pull outs that allow water, chlorides, and debris to infiltrate the joint, and subsequently the bearings below. One area of the strip seal that is particularly problematic is where it terminates at the interface between the deck and the barrier rail. The Iowa DOT has noted that the initial construction quality of the current strip seal termination detail is not satisfactory, nor ideal, and a need exists for re-evaluation and possibly re-design of this detail. Desirable qualities of a strip seal termination detail provide a seal that is simple and fast to construct, facilitate quick gland removal and installation, and provide a reliable, durable barrier to prevent chloride-contaminated water from reaching the substructure. To meet the objectives of this research project, several strip seal termination details were evaluated in the laboratory. Alternate termination details may not only function better than the current Iowa DOT standard, but are also less complicated to construct, facilitating better quality control.

40|$|Objectives:The aim of {{this study}} was to assess {{efficacy}} of transfemoral endovascular aneurysm management (TEAM) during mid-term follow-up. Design:Prospective multicentre study. Materials and Methods:In 26 patients treated by a Tube Endograft, the pre- and postoperative contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) images were reviewed in a blinded fashion. Aortic diameters were measured at the coeliac trunk, the inferior and superior aneurysm neck and the level of the maximal aneurysm size. The changes in diameter were related to the presence or absence of an endoleak. Results:The median follow-up was 12 months. In 10 patients an endoleak was found. Three endoleaks sealed spontaneously within 30 days after operation. All aneurysms with persistent endoleaks expanded, at a median rate of 0. 30 mm per month. Four patients were converted between 9 and 14 months after TEAM. Aneurysms excluded by the endoprosthesis showed a median shrinkage of 0. 41 mm per month. The inferior aneurysm neck demonstrated significant growth during follow-up, unrelated to endoleaks. Conclusions:This study demonstrated the efficacy of TEAM in discontinuing the process of aneurysm <b>expansion.</b> Complete <b>seal</b> of the aneurysm sac after TEAM leads to shrinkage or arrest of growth of the aneurysm, while persistent endoleak is associated with progressive expansion...|$|R
5000|$|In the UK, {{prior to}} the use of <b>sealed</b> <b>expansion</b> tanks, [...] "open" [...] tanks were {{installed}} in the roof space to accommodate the water's expansion; these had the disadvantage of being exposed to the cold air in the roof space. This, without effective loft insulation, could fall below freezing, and could cause the pipework supplying the tank to freeze. However, with good pipe and tank insulation, this was in practice quite rare. Although such systems were remarkably trouble free, there are concerns about the potability of water from roof tanks due to the possibility of contamination. The other major disadvantage is that the water pressure from a roof tank is considerably lower than mains water pressure, making the use of mixer taps sometimes unpredictable.|$|R
