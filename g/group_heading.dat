2500|$|According to an {{autosomal}} DNA {{study by}} Hodgson et al. (2014), the Afro-Asiatic languages were likely spread across Africa and the Near East by an ancestral population(s) carrying a newly identified non-African genetic component, which the researchers dub the [...] "Ethio-Somali". This Ethio-Somali component is today most common among Afro-Asiatic-speaking {{populations in the}} Horn of Africa. It reaches a frequency peak among ethnic Somalis, representing {{the majority of their}} ancestry. The Ethio-Somali component is most closely related to the Maghrebi non-African genetic component, and is believed to have diverged from all other non-African ancestries at least 23,000 years ago. On this basis, the researchers suggest that the original Ethio-Somali carrying population(s) probably arrived in the pre-agricultural period from the Near East, having crossed over into northeastern Africa via the Sinai Peninsula. The population then likely split into two branches, with one <b>group</b> <b>heading</b> westward toward the Maghreb and the other moving south into the Horn. Ancient DNA analysis indicates that this foundational ancestry in the Horn region is akin to that of the Neolithic farmers of the southern Levant.|$|E

2500|$|According to the Russian paper Kommersant, another {{alternative}} version [...] "actively discussed among the Chechens living in Georgia" [...] {{is that the}} gunmen belonged to a Chechen armed <b>group</b> <b>heading</b> for a meeting of field commanders with the Caucasus Emirate leader Doku Umarov in Dagestan and had entered Georgia's territory through the Chechen section of the Russian-Georgian border, but got lost along the way near Dagestan and so attempted to take the locals as guides.
