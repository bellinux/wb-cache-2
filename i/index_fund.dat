25|$|Several {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that hedge funds are sufficiently diversifying to merit inclusion in investor portfolios, but this is disputed for example by Mark Kritzman who performed a mean-variance optimization calculation on an opportunity set that consisted of a stock <b>index</b> <b>fund,</b> a bond <b>index</b> <b>fund,</b> and ten hypothetical hedge funds. The optimizer found that a mean-variance efficient portfolio did not contain any allocation to hedge funds, largely because of the impact of performance fees. To demonstrate this, Kritzman repeated the optimization using an assumption that the hedge funds incurred no performance fees. The result from this second optimization was an allocation of 74% to hedge funds.|$|E
25|$|ETFs have a {{reputation}} for lower costs than traditional mutual funds. This will be evident as a lower expense ratio. This is mainly from two factors, the fact that most ETFs are index funds and some advantages of the ETF structure. However, this needs to be compared in each case, since some index mutual funds also have a very low expense ratio, and some ETFs' expense ratios are relatively high. An <b>index</b> <b>fund</b> is much simpler to run, since it does not require some security selection, and can be largely done by computer. Not only does an ETF have lower shareholder-related expenses, but because it does not have to invest cash contributions or fund cash redemptions, an ETF does not have to maintain a cash reserve for redemptions and saves on brokerage expenses. Mutual funds can charge 1% to 3%, or more; <b>index</b> <b>fund</b> expense ratios are generally lower, while ETFs are almost always less than 1%. Over the long term, these cost differences can compound into a noticeable difference.|$|E

25|$|Most ETFs are {{index funds}} {{that attempt to}} {{replicate}} {{the performance of a}} specific index. Indexes may be based on stocks, bonds, commodities, or currencies. An <b>index</b> <b>fund</b> seeks to track the performance of an index by holding in its portfolio either the contents of the index or a representative sample of the securities in the index.

Index ETF assets are about $1.2 trillion, compared with about $7 billion for actively managed ETFs.

2500|$|Towards {{his later}} life, {{particularly}} following {{the global financial}} crisis of 2007-08, Buffett became an increasingly vocal critic of active management, i.e., mutual funds and hedge funds.

Buffett said in one of his letters to shareholders that [...] "when trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients."

2500|$|Thus, {{according}} to the EMH, no investor has an advantage in predicting a return on a stock price because no one has access to information not already available to everyone else.

This [...] "random walk" [...] of prices, commonly spoken about in the EMH school of thought, results in the failure of any investment strategy that aims to beat the market consistently.

Hedge funds, however, are actively managed, so that tracking is impossible. Non-investable hedge fund indices {{on the other hand}} may be more or less representative, but returns data on many of the reference group of funds is non-public.
