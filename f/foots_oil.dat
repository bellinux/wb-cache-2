5000|$|The {{existing}} contract required {{that a second}} well be drilled within thirty days after the first one. A new agreement was negotiated which allowed Heywood to continue drilling beyond {{the bottom of the}} first well. If favorable conditions were found at 1,500 feet, he could proceed to an even greater depth. At 1,500 <b>feet,</b> no <b>oil</b> was discovered, and the team ran short of drill pipe. However, Heywood opted to order more drill pipe and continue to try. At 1,700 <b>feet,</b> <b>oil</b> was discovered in sugar sand. Additional drilling discovered 110 <b>feet</b> of <b>oil</b> sand. A casing was set with a gate valve, and after running a bailer the well gushed forth a four-inch stream of <b>oil</b> over 100 <b>feet</b> high. This spray of oil and sand lasted for seven hours and covered several acres of rice fields. However, the sand soon filled up the casing, and despite repeated attempts to clear it, the well was abandoned. Though the drilling failed, Heywood's work signaled the beginning of the oil boom in Louisiana. [...] Heywood thereafter owned and operated barges on the Mermentau River in southwestern Louisiana and constructed a pipeline from the oil fields to the railroad.|$|R

50|$|Engineer Thomas Leps, who {{had served}} as {{consultant}} on the 1964 state investigation, took on a role as neutral reviewer in this and most subsequent American studies of the failure.

Leps associated the latter with repressurization of the oilfield.

Approximately 1700 barrels (71,000 gallons) of crude oil mingled with the already contaminated flood waters. The EPA worked to prevent the oil and flood water mix from continuing downriver, where it could damage the water in Oologah Lake near Oologah, Oklahoma. Many residential water supplies are drawn from that lake. A minimal amount of oil reached Oolagah Lake, and it did not pose a threat to the water supplies of other cities along the Verdigris River or from the lake.
