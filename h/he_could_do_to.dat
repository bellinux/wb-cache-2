5|$|The {{restoration}} {{then was}} carried out between 1907 and 1911, using the principles of anastylosis and led by Theodor van Erp. The first seven months of restoration were occupied with excavating the grounds around the monument to find missing Buddha heads and panel stones. Van Erp dismantled and rebuilt the upper three circular platforms and stupas. Along the way, Van Erp discovered more things <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> improve the monument; he submitted another proposal, which was approved with the additional cost of 34,600 guilders. At first glance, Borobudur had been restored to its old glory. Van Erp went further by carefully reconstructing the chhatra (three-tiered parasol) pinnacle {{on top of the}} main stupa. However, he later dismantled the chhatra, citing that there were not enough original stones used in reconstructing the pinnacle, which means that the original design of Borobudur's pinnacle is actually unknown. The dismantled chhatra now is stored in Karmawibhangga Museum, a few hundred meters north from Borobudur.|$|E
25|$|Edward III {{continued}} {{to focus on}} France, though he made clear his intentions of addressing Scotland when time permitted. But {{at the same time}} that Edward III was considering how best to deal with the French, the French were continuing to pour supplies into Scotland, and as the year progressed the Scottish forces began to encroach even into northern England, laying waste to Cumberland. Such actions forced Edward III to take the Scottish threat seriously, and in October he sent William Montagu, 1st Earl of Salisbury, to Scotland to see what <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> contain the situation.|$|E

When the city council appealed to him to rescind that order, {{on the grounds that}} it would cause great {{hardship}} to women, children, the elderly, and others who bore no responsibility for the conduct of the war, Sherman sent a written response in which he sought to articulate his conviction that a lasting peace would be possible only if the Union were restored, and that he was therefore prepared to do all <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> quash the rebellion: ...|$|E

500|$|Ian Hendry {{stars as}} Dr John Kane, British {{astrophysicist}} {{and head of}} the Phoenix project. Hendry, who had appeared in the television series The Avengers (1961–69) and, according to Anderson, [...] "was always drinking", performed the stunt sequence depicting the aftermath of the Dove crash while drunk: [...] "...he was pissed as a newt, and it was as much as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> stagger away. Despite all that, it looked exactly as it was supposed to on-screen!" [...] In the draft script, Kane's first name is Philip, and he has a wife called Susan. In scenes deleted from the completed film, a romance between Kane and Lise Hartman, a EUROSEC official portrayed by Austrian actress Loni von Friedl, is played out at Kane's villa and on a beach in Portugal.|$|E
500|$|Digby unsuccessfully {{sought an}} {{audience}} with James to try and explain himself, in Fraser's opinion suggesting either that {{the extent of his}} involvement was limited, or that he was [...] "astonishingly naive and trusting of his sovereign's forgiveness." [...] While imprisoned he busied himself with writing secret letters, smuggled from the Tower and not rediscovered until Kenelm Digby's death in 1675. [...] Although he was fortunate not to suffer the fate of Guy Fawkes, who was tortured on several occasions, one of these letters hints that it had been [...] "in a fashion, offered". [...] He described his refusal to cooperate with his interrogators, boasted of his deceit, and how there was nothing <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> make the plot appear less abhorrent to fellow Catholics. [...] Digby also carved an inscription on the wall of his cell, extant as of 1996.|$|E
500|$|In March 1996, Sega of Japan representatives, {{including}} CEO Hayao Nakayama, visited STI {{headquarters to}} evaluate the game's progress. They were unimpressed by the main game engine's performance on the Saturn, although Senn and Alon {{did not have an}} opportunity to demonstrate the PC version. Therefore, Nakayama requested the entire game be reworked around the boss engine. To achieve this in time for the strict December 1996 deadline, Coffin's team was moved into a place of isolation from further company politics and worked between sixteen and twenty hours a day. [...] Then, in April, Bernie Stolar approached the STI team and inquired of Wallis what <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> help the game meet its deadline. [...] Wallis suggested that the game engine from Sonic Team's Nights into Dreams would be helpful. [...] Stolar agreed and acquired the engine. [...] However, the engine's creator and lead programmer of the original Mega Drive Sonic games, Yuji Naka, reportedly threatened to leave the company if it was used. [...] STI lost two weeks of development time from the loss of the Nights engine. A playable demo of the game was displayed at the May 1996 Electronic Entertainment Expo.|$|E

500|$|Katzenberg {{moved the}} opening of Antz from spring 1999 to October 1998 to compete with Pixar's release. David Price writes in his 2008 book The Pixar Touch that a rumor, [...] "never confirmed", was that Katzenberg had given PDI [...] "rich {{financial}} incentives to induce them to whatever {{it would take to}} have Antz ready first, despite Pixar's head start". Jobs was furious and called Katzenberg and began yelling. Katzenberg made an offer: He would delay production of Antz if Jobs and Disney would move A Bug’s Life so that it did not compete with The Prince of Egypt. Jobs believed it [...] "a blatant extortion attempt" [...] and would not go for it, explaining that there was nothing <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> convince Disney to change the date. Katzenberg casually responded that Jobs himself had taught him how to conduct similar business long ago, explaining that Jobs had come to Pixar's rescue by making the deal for Toy Story, as Pixar was near bankruptcy at that time. [...] "I was the one guy there for you back then, and now you’re allowing them to use you to screw me," [...] Katzenberg said. He suggested that if Jobs wanted to, he could simply slow down production on A Bug’s Life without telling Disney. If he did, Katzenberg said, he would put Antz on hold. Lasseter also claimed Katzenberg had phoned him with the proposition, but Katzenberg denied these charges later.|$|E

2500|$|Minor {{improvements}} at the Palais Royal {{began in}} 1661 {{at the time}} of Philippe's marriage to Henrietta, but the property was part of the crown holdings, and had not been used officially for years. [...] Philippe was limited in what <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> renovate the building until it was given to him in 1692. Philippe again turned to Mansart for assistance in modernizing it. The interior décor was entrusted to Antoine Coypel, whose father Noël Coypel had previously worked at the palace. In 1695, Philippe bought a small island in the Seine directly opposite the château, which he renamed the [...] "Île de Monsieur".|$|E

He got the idea to start a camp, one that [...] "is interested not merely in the boy, but in the man the boy will become." [...] He set up a foundation, naming it after his father; the foundation runs the camp. For decades, Jonas personally interviewed many prospective campers and he was fondly called by all by his nickname, [...] "Freddie." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hawke {{was sent}} to replace Admiral John Byng as {{commander}} in the Mediterranean, with orders to hoist his flag in the second-rate HMS Ramillies, in June 1756. Byng {{had been unable to}} relieve Menorca (historically called [...] "Minorca" [...] by the British) following the Battle of Minorca and he was sent back to Britain where he was tried and executed. Almost as soon as Menorca had fallen in June 1756, the French fleet had withdrawn to Toulon in case they were attacked by Hawke. Once he arrived off Menorca, Hawke found that the island had surrendered and there was little <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> reverse this. He decided not to land the troops he had brought with him from Gibraltar. Hawke then spent three months cruising off Menorca and Marseille before returning home where he gave evidence against Byng. Hawke was subsequently criticised by some supporters of Byng, for not having blockaded either Menorca or Toulon. He was promoted to full admiral on 24 February 1757.|$|E

2500|$|At his {{memorial}} service Leikny Øgrim told {{of growing up}} with a big brother who would read the dictionary {{from beginning to end}} and who from reading even the telephone book could learn something to relate to acquaintances. Douglas Draper, secretary of the Norwegian Esperanto League, also delivered a short talk on behalf of the NEL, by turns bantering and earnest. He said there were three kinds of Esperantists. There were active members engaged in management and organizational duties. There were passive members satisfied with paying their dues. Then there was Tron Øgrim. It might happen that for long periods the NEL would hear nothing from him; then he would telephone to ask: [...] "Skylder jeg noe gryn?" [...] ("Do I owe any groats?"—i.e., membership dues.) He might show up at the NEL office in Oslo and purchase not one or two books, but a whole load. While most Esperantists would plan their trips to major Esperanto congresses more than six months in advance, Tron might call up three days {{before the start of the}} event and ask what <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> help out.|$|E
2500|$|While not {{active in}} any Watergate {{activities}} per se, Gray was aware through {{his dealings with}} John Dean that the White House was concerned about what might be discovered from a full-field FBI investigation and explored what <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> limit the investigation or shift {{it away from the}} Bureau’s jurisdiction. As Dean wrote in his Watergate memoir “Blind Ambition,” he used Gray as a shill knowing that “we could count on Pat Gray to keep the Hunt material from becoming public, and he did not disappoint us.” [...] In fact, even though he thought of this as a political not criminal situation and that he was ultimately serving the President as the “nation’s chief law enforcement officer,” Gray would come dangerously close to collusion because he chose to be useful to the White House without asking the hard questions. Dean goes on to say, “I met Pat Gray secretly at his home in southwest Washington. We were both apprehensive about the meeting as we walked to a park and sat down on a bench overlooking the Potomac, discussing my request to obtain FBI 302s and AirTels on the Watergate investigation." ...|$|E
2500|$|In another {{situation}} involving sibling rivalries, David {{is confronted}} by James, who he blames for {{being taken away}} from their mother and being consigned to a worse life with King George. After James knocks David out by using his stun gun, he tricks his niece Emma and Robin Hood to lead him to Zelena's baby. James reveals himself when they reach the rendezvous point, after slapping an anti-magic cuff on Emma, and is joined by Cruella, who is {{still looking for a}} way to escape the Underworld, by stealing Zelena's baby for leverage with Hades. When Cruella and James enter the harbor, as part of their plan to send Emma and Robin to their deaths, David and Hook arrive to rescue Emma and Robin, before it's too late. Hook grabs the gun dropped by James and removed the cuffs from Emma, and Cruella runs back to safety. Meanwhile, David attempts to help James move on while confronting him, as James continues to believe that killing David is the [...] "unfinished business" [...] that is keeping him in the Underworld. After David's plea to help James falls on deaf ears, the twins continue fighting each other on the edge of the dock, with David wanting the others to stay out of the struggle. As James begins to lose, he pulls out a boot knife, despite David's pleas to stop. David eventually twists James off into the River of Lost Souls, condemning him to eternal torment, while Cruella flees the scene. Emma tells her father that there was nothing <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> save James, despite his best efforts, and that some people just won't ever move on.|$|E
