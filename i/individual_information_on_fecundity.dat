40|$|Abstract The jaraquis (Semaprochilodus spp.) are {{the most}} {{abundant}} group in the fishing landing in Manaus. However, just command and control management strategies {{have been used by}} the fishery governmental agency in the region without the power to enforce centralized decisions. The fishermen and their culture represent a source of <b>information</b> <b>on</b> dynamics of the resources and aquatic environments, fundamental in making possible the co-management of the fishing resources. The present study aims to contribute to management through identification of common information available in scientific and traditional knowledge about the jaraquis' bio-ecology. There were 57 semi-structured interviews recorded with fishermen of Manaus and rural areas of Manacapuru in 2002 concerning biological and ecological aspects. Similarity was observed between scientific and traditional knowledge in the following items: size of first sexual maturation, spawning type, parental care, trophic relationships and migratory behavior, as well as in some aspects of the mortality and growth of the species. However, there was less ethnoicthyological <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>fecundity</b> and the determination of the age and growth of adult fish. Common information would be used preferably by agencies to start an effective and technical dialogue with commercial and riverine fishermen to design management plans in a decentralized strategy. </p...|$|R

40|$|We used {{improved}} <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>fecundity</b> {{and credible}} estimates of survival {{to define the}} plausible bounds of maximum intrinsic rate of population increase (r m) in magpie geese and explored the management and conservation implications, given current estimates of off-take. We considered previous estimates of r m (0. 78, based on time-series analysis of aerial count data) and the corresponding predicted maximum sustainable harvest rates (30 – 39 % per annum) to be excessive, thereby risking poor management decisions. In contrast, our estimate of the maximum plausible range of r m (0. 11 – 0. 28) is substantially lower than the previous estimate, and suggests maximum harvest rates {{of no more than}} 5 – 14 % of total population size per annum. We consider that it would be unwise to adopt the prior estimate of r m for management policy because it would risk over-exploitation. Our results embody a more precautionary approach to assessing maximum sustainable yield for magpie geese in northern Australia, and are not confounded by migration. The move from a simple empirical model to a partially mechanistic one reflects a significant improvement in understanding, but must nevertheless be viewed as part of an ongoing process of model refinement and testing.

The twin pair difference estimates from instrumental variables estimation for genetically identical twins reveal a significant height-wage premium for women but not for men.
