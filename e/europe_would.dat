5|$|More broadly, one {{hallmark}} of the 1950s {{was the beginning of}} European integration—a fundamental by-product of the Cold War that Truman and Eisenhower promoted politically, economically, and militarily, but which later administrations viewed ambivalently, fearful that an independent <b>Europe</b> <b>would</b> forge a separate détente with the Soviet Union, which would use this to exacerbate Western disunity.|$|E
5|$|All former {{republics of}} the Soviet Union, which were {{geographically}} situated in <b>Europe,</b> <b>would</b> later compete in the contest on their own in the 1990s and 2000s: Russia, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan, except Kazakhstan, with four of the countries going on to win one of the contests: Estonia, Latvia, Russia, and Azerbaijan. Ukraine was the first ex-USSR country to win twice.|$|E
5|$|Chrysler Corporation {{approved}} {{the development of}} the model on the assumption that Chrysler <b>Europe</b> <b>would</b> sell 60,000 C9 models per year, which translated into a projected 5percent share of the executive car market. This estimate seemed achievable because Chrysler had a 7percent market share in Europe overall. The projected sales would have covered the car's tooling costs, with the development costs accounted for separately, as part of an independent annual budget.|$|E

5|$|Blaine and {{his wife}} and daughters sailed for Europe in June 1887, visiting England, Ireland, Germany, France, Austria-Hungary, and finally Scotland, where they stayed at the summer home of Andrew Carnegie. While in France, Blaine {{wrote a letter to the}} New-York Tribune criticizing Cleveland’s plans to reduce the tariff, saying that free trade with <b>Europe</b> <b>would</b> {{impoverish}} American workers and farmers. The family returned to the United States in August 1887. His letter in the Tribune had raised his political profile even higher, and by 1888 Theodore Roosevelt and Henry Cabot Lodge, both former opponents, urged Blaine to run against Cleveland again. Opinion within the party was overwhelmingly in favor of renominating Blaine.|$|E
5|$|Europeans would sail to the West African {{coast and}} trade African kings {{manufactured}} goods (rifles and ammunition) for slave. From there slaves {{would be sent}} to the West Indies or the east coast of North America to be used for labor. Goods such as cotton, molasses, sugar, tobacco would be sent from these places back to Europe. <b>Europe</b> <b>would</b> also use their goods and trade with Asian countries for tea, cloth and spices. The triangle trade in a sense was an agreement for established trade routes, that led to greater global integration, which ultimately contributed to globalization.|$|E
5|$|Henry VIII {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of an artillery blockhouse at East Tilbury in 1539–40 as part of a major scheme to fortify the coastline of England and Wales. It followed his break from the Pope and the Catholic Church, which led to fears that the Catholic powers of <b>Europe</b> <b>would</b> seek to invade so as to reimpose Papal authority. Five blockhouses were built along the Thames between Gravesend and Higham – two on the north bank at Tilbury and East Tilbury and three on the south bank at Gravesend, Milton (near the present New Tavern Fort) and Higham.|$|E

5|$|Mathematics {{were also}} used in musical tuning and music theory. The 2nd-century-BCE Huainanzi, {{compiled}} by eight scholars under the patronage of King Liu An (179–122 BCE), outlined the use of twelve tones on a musical scale. Jing Fang (78–37 BCE), a mathematician and music theorist, expanded these to create a scale of 60 tones. While doing so, Jing Fang realized that 53 just fifths is approximate to 31 octaves. By calculating the difference at 177147⁄176776, Jing reached the same value of 53 equal temperament duly discovered by the German mathematician Nicholas Mercator (1620–1687) (i.e. 353/284, known as Mercator's comma). Later, the prince Zhu Zaiyu (1536–1611 CE) in Ming China and Simon Stevin (1548–1620 CE) of the Flemish Region in <b>Europe</b> <b>would</b> simultaneously (but separately) discover the mathematical formula for equal temperament.|$|E

The band also stated that they would like to set up an Australian tour during the summer and singer Brandan Schieppati stated in a reply to an Instagram comment that the band would have a final U.S. tour possibly starting in September. November 2013 the band announced final west coast dates will take place in 2014.|$|E
25|$|Corbin {{had more}} {{industrial}} desires for building {{the train to}} Montauk.

25|$|In 1677, Leibniz {{called for}} a European confederation, governed by a council or senate, whose members would {{represent}} entire nations and {{would be free to}} vote their consciences; this is sometimes considered an anticipation of the European Union.

25|$|During this period, rakı was {{produced}} by distillation of grapes pomace (cibre) obtained during wine fermentation. When the amount of pomace was not sufficient, alcohol imported from <b>Europe</b> <b>would</b> be added. If anise was not added, {{it would take the}} name düz rakı ("straight rakı"), whereas rakı prepared with the addition of gum mastic was named sakız rakısı (gum rakı) or mastikha.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} complicating factors related to such ventures {{is the fact that}} the CIS states' broad railway gauge is {{incompatible}} with China and Western and Central Europe's standard gauge.

25|$|In Europe, BMG {{created a}} minor scandal in 2001 when it {{released}} Natalie Imbruglia's second album, White Lilies Island, without warning labels {{stating that the}} CD had copy protection.
