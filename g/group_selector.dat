Hence local calls within the exchange and busy direct junction routes to exchanges with high traffic from that exchange could be trunked via one code selection stage, which reduced both the setting-up time and the total numbers of selectors required in the network. Distant exchanges which did not justify direct junction routes could be called via one or more tandem exchanges; being routed via one, two or three local code selectors in the originating exchange, one or more selectors in the tandem exchange(s), and finally the numeric selection stages in the terminating exchange for the last four digits, which were stored and forwarded without translation.|$|R

40|$|Many feature {{selection}} algorithms {{have been proposed}} in the past focusing on improving classification accuracy. In this work, we point out the importance of stable {{feature selection}} for knowledge discovery from high-dimensional data, and identify two causes of instability of feature selection algorithms: selection of a minimum subset without redundant features and small sample size. We propose a general framework for stable feature selection which emphasizes both good generalization and stability of feature selection results. The framework identifies dense feature groups based on kernel density estimation and treats features in each dense group as a coherent entity for feature selection. An efficient algorithm DRAGS (Dense Relevant Attribute <b>Group</b> <b>Selector)</b> is developed under this framework. We also introduce a general measure for assessing the stability of feature selection algorithms. Our empirical study based on microarray data verifies that dense feature groups remain stable under random sample hold out, and the DRAGS algorithm is effective in identifying a set of feature groups which exhibit both high classification accuracy and stability...|$|E
40|$|In {{multicellular}} organisms morphogenesis {{results from}} organized cell proliferation and spatial cell differentiation. A genetic approach to development has the two-fold task of explaining how the genetic information is selected {{and how it}} expresses itself in developmental operations. The genetic and developmental analysis of morphogenetic mutants in Drosophila has thrown some light on both problems. Experiments on genetic mosaics confirm {{the idea that the}} genetic information is expressed within the cell itself. The behaviour of those morphogenetic mutants in mosaics suggests the existence of at least two classes of morphogenetic genes. Genes of a first group (cyto-differentiation genes) would include those controlling cell behaviour relevant to morphogenesis and common to most developing systems: mitotic rate, mitotic orientation, cell recognition and cuticular differentiation. Those of a second <b>group</b> (<b>selector</b> genes) seem to control developmental pathways and share several operational characteristics. A functional scheme is advanced showing how selector genes may become activated and control development. We postulate that inductor molecules interfere with the products of activator genes which are selector specific. In this way signals extrinsic to the genome become translated into genetic ones. The activation, or repression, of selector genes occurs once in development and remains clonally irreversible. This, possibly, is the genetic basis of a stable state of determination. However, the products of these activated selector genes are required throughout subsequent development in order to maintain a certain pathway. They may function by activating in turn the corresponding cytodifferentiation genes leading to changes in developmental operations. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{is to develop a}} framework, along with the tools required, for the development of process monitoring solutions. In most cases, it is impractical to develop precise models from first principles for monitoring purposes as it requires consideration of not only the complex physics involved in the process but also the interactions between different components constituting the process. In these cases, soft computational methods, which can make use of process data to capture its trends and dynamics, provide an attractive alternative for the quick development and deployment of process monitoring solutions. ^ Firstly, signal based methods based on feature-level sensor fusion are considered for monitoring purposes. The problem of optimal sensor selection is formulated as the problem of selecting optimal groups of inputs during linear or non-linear model training from data. Novel penalty terms called as Group Selection Terms (GST) are derived based on hierarchical Bayesian modeling. A generalized algorithm based on the “Bound Optimization” approach is derived for simultaneously selecting the optimal sensors, sensor-features and model parameters from data. Three specific algorithms called Linear Embedded Sensor Selection (L-ESS), Nonlinear Embedded Sensor Selection (NL-ESS) and Sparse Multiple Kernel Learning (SMKL) are derived for training models which allow the user to tradeoff the number of points they can handle versus the degree of non-linearity allowed by the model. The ability of these algorithms to learn models which use fewer groups of features while achieving a high degree of prediction accuracy is tested using real data sets. Finally, NL-ESS is tested on experimental data obtained for the purpose of monitoring burn and chatter conditions during cylindrical plunge grinding. ^ While the performance of the regularization based methods was found to be satisfactory in terms of prediction accuracy as well as the sparsity of the obtained solution, one of its main drawbacks {{is the fact that it}} requires the tuning of one or more tradeoff parameters. In an attempt to further automate the process of sensor and sensor-feature selection, the hierarchical Bayesian formulation is extended further and two algorithms, Variational Relevant <b>Group</b> <b>Selector</b> (VRGS) and the Relevant <b>Group</b> <b>Selector</b> (RGS), are derived to estimate the parameter probability distributions directly from the data. Experimental results using data from plunge grinding monitoring and diesel engine diagnostics verify the excellent performance of the algorithms without the need for any manual parameter tuning. ^ As a complementary approach, some of the insights gained from classical model based fault detection and isolation (FDI) methods are exploited by making use of data based dynamic process models. In this work Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are used to capture the dynamics of any system that can be represented in the state space form. A novel constructive procedure for training RNNs from data is proposed. A systematic method for incorporating partial state measurements into the structure of a RNN is proposed where the measured states are augmented with hidden node activations to get a complete dynamic model of the system. A robust stochastic nonlinear discrete observer called the Adaptive Divided Difference Filter (ADDF) is developed for simultaneous state and parameter estimation in uncertain systems with the goal of combining it with the RNN system model for data based FDI. All the modules of this framework are validated using simulation examples. ...|$|E
50|$|The first code {{selectors}} had {{levels for}} local exchange calls and {{calls to the}} local tandem exchange. An exchange with up to 23 outgoing routes would require a second code selection stage on some calls, and for more outgoing routes (up to 93) some third selection stages. But as a nearby business exchange might have 50 TU (traffic units) in the BH (busy hour), and more distant exchanges might have only 2 or 3 TUs, the busy routes {{should be on the}} first code selectors and the least busy routes only via a second and perhaps a third selection stage. Hence for a hypothetical example with 30 outgoing routes, three schemes are possible with (A) three second and no third code <b>selector</b> <b>groups,</b> (B) two second and one third code <b>selector</b> <b>groups,</b> and (C) one second and two third code <b>selector</b> <b>groups.</b> The number of switches for the hypothetical traffic distribution is 348, 302 and 315 switches, i.e. scheme B is the optimum; but each exchange must be calculated individually. The busy routes should also be allocated to the lower levels on the selectors to minimise setting-up time and also the number of operations of the mechanism and hence the wear on them.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1984 Visual {{selection}} for grain yield {{may be a}} limiting factor in identifying superior yielding genotypes in a breeding program. This investigation was conducted (1) to compare the effectiveness of visual {{selection for}} grain yield by three <b>selector</b> <b>groups</b> representing different levels of plant breeding experience, and (2) to examine the association of selected traits {{with the process of}} evaluating plots visually for grain yield. The germplasm evaluated consisted of fifty non-segregating, diverse genotypes selected to include a wide range of expression for phenotypic characters. They were grown in solid-seeded, two-row plots with three replications in a randomized block design during 1981 - 1982. Data were collected on a plot basis for grain yield and twenty-two agronomic traits. Eighteen selectors were placed in three groups comprised of two plant breeders, eight graduate students, and eight summer student workers, respectively, from the Oregon State University cereal breeding program. Evaluations were made on two separate days by scoring each of the 150 plots on a scale of 1 to 5 for grain yield. The plant breeder selectors were the most successful of the three groups in discriminating both high and low yielding plots. The two best graduate student selectors were similar in ability to the plant breeders in scoring plots for high yield, although not in scoring for low yield. The remaining graduate student and summer worker selectors were generally not able to score more low and high yielding plots "correctly" than would be expected if selection were done at random. Considered individually, the most effective selectors failed to select several high yielding plots. However, when selections of the four most effective selectors were combined, only one of the twenty highest yielding plots was omitted. Results comparing trait association with actual plot grain yield and with selector scoring for plot grain yield suggested "biases" for or against certain traits. Biases for later heading and maturing plant types with wide flag leaves were common to all <b>selector</b> <b>groups</b> when visually selecting for high yield, as were earlier heading and maturing entries with narrower flag leaves when selecting for low yield. The plant breeder selectors were notable for lack of trait biases relative to other <b>selector</b> <b>groups.</b> In contrast, the summer worker selectors tended to overemphasize several spike characteristics whether selecting for high or low yield.

In this work we use FCA to optimize style sheets to reduce redundancy, merge several rules together, and <b>group</b> the <b>selectors</b> with their declarations to express general formatting concepts. Two problems we solved include converting complex style sheets into a form on which FCA can be applied, and interpreting the resulting concept lattice to avoid introducing too many styles for small concepts.

40|$|AbstractThe {{initiation}} of eye formation in all seeing animals {{is controlled by}} a <b>group</b> of <b>selector</b> genes that together forms the retinal determination cascade. In Drosophila, mice and humans, loss-of-function mutations lead to defects in eye and/or head development. While ectopic expression of these genes is sufficient to direct non-retinal tissues towards an eye fate, the ability of each gene to initiate eye formation is neither unlimited nor equal. A particularly enigmatic observation has been that {{one member of the}} cascade, sine oculis (so), which {{is a member of the}} SIX family of homeobox transcription factors, is unable to initiate eye development in non-retinal tissues. It is in contrast to every other retinal determination gene including optix, another Six family member, which can induce eye formation when expressed on its own. Here we demonstrate that, in contrast to published reports, expression of so on its own is sufficient to induce eye development within non-retinal tissues. We have extended results from prior reports on binding partner selectivity and DNA binding sites by conducting a structure/function analysis of the SO and OPTIX proteins. Here we demonstrate that the SIX domains and C-terminal portions of the SO and OPTIX proteins are required for functional specificity of SIX class transcription factors while the homeodomain of these proteins are interchangeable. Taken together, these results shed new light on the role that so plays in eye specification...|$|R

Besides using common bilaterian models, more attention has recently been targeted at the identification and characterization of these genes within the basal metazoan phyla. Cnidaria as a diploblastic sister group to bilateria with simple and yet specialized organs are suitable models for studies on the sensory organ origin and the associated role of homeobox genes. In this work, Pou and Six homeobox genes, together with a broad range of other sensory-specific transcription factors, were identified in the transcriptome of hydrozoan jellyfish Craspedacusta sowerbyi. Phylogenetic analyses of Pou and Six proteins revealed cnidarian-specific sequence motifs and contributed to the classification of individual factors. The majority of the Craspedacusta sowerbyi Pou and Six homeobox genes are predominantly expressed in statocysts, manubrium and nerve ring, the tissues with sensory and nervous activities.
