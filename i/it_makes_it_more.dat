500|$|Climbing gyms often feature {{multiple}} {{problems within}} the same section of wall. In the US the most common method Routesetters use to designate the intended route for a particular problem is by placing colored tape next to each hold—for example, holds with red tape would indicate one bouldering problem, while green tape {{would be used to}} set off a different problem in the same area. Across {{much of the rest of}} the world problems and grades are usually designated by using a set color of plastic hold to indicate a particular problem. For example, green may be v0-v1, blue may be v2-v3 and so on. Setting via color has certain advantages, the most notable of which are that <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> obvious where the holds for a problem are, and that there is no chance of tape being accidentally kicked off of footholds. [...] Smaller, resource-poor climbing gyms may prefer taped problems because large, expensive holds can be used in multiple routes simply by marking them with more than one color of tape.|$|E

According to Gilkison, “The goal was to streamline <b>it,</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> theatrical, reinvent <b>it</b> {{with the help of the}} dancers, who had their own ideas of how to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> contemporary." ...|$|R

500|$|Quesada {{confirmed}} in April 2014 that the Netflix series {{would be set}} within the MCU.

It does take place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's all connected. But that doesn't necessarily mean that we would look up in the sky and see [...] It's just a different part of New York that we have not yet seen in the Marvel movies." [...] In January 2015, Netflix COO Ted Sarandos said Netflix planned to release a Marvel series approximately a year apart from each other after Daredevils April 2015 release. A year later, Sarandos noted that the release schedules of the Marvel Netflix series are dependent on the [...] "long production times and long post times. In some cases, when we have characters crossover, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> difficult to manage production. It's not the goal to put out {{more than one or two}} [...] year ... The complex one is really The Defenders. The Defenders production schedule will determine a lot of the season 2 and 3 output of those shows." [...] He also noted on potential spin-offs that [...] "all the characters in the universe could also spin out" [...] into their own series at some point, with Netflix ordering Marvel's The Punisher, a spin-off from Daredevil, that April. Sarandos later stated that Netflix was trying to close the gap between releases of Marvel seasons, but would always prioritize the quality of the series over higher numbers of releases per year. He also said that Netflix was open to exploring the MCU beyond the Defenders series, including potential crossovers with ABC's Marvel series.|$|E

2500|$|Wittgenstein {{makes this}} clear in section 258: [...] "A {{definition}} surely serves {{to establish the}} meaning of a sign.—Well, that is done precisely by the concentrating of my attention; for in this way I impress on myself the connexion between the sign and the sensation.—But [...] "I impress it on myself" [...] can only mean: this process brings it about that I remember the connexion right in the future. But in the present case I have no criterion of correctness." [...] This absence of any criterion of correctness is not a problem because <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> difficult for the private linguist to remember his sensation correctly; it is a problem because it undermines the intelligibility of such a concept as remembering the sensation, whether correctly or incorrectly.|$|E

2500|$|Although Norwood {{received}} a sole writing credit on album cut [...] "Finally" [...] only, she noted Afrodisiac the most honest effort {{of her career}} yet based on its deeply autobiographical content, commenting: [...] "Everything I do {{has something to do}} with what I've gone through in my life [...] I definitely wanted to incorporate that in my art. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> real when you add what's been going on in your life in your music. I've grown and I've gone through some things in my life, and I celebrate that, I honor that." [...] Soundwise, her collaboration with Timbaland, recent motherhood, life experiences, and growing affinity toward alternative music such as Coldplay, caused Norwood to shift toward a more matured outlook and raw nature with the album, a venture into the organic sounds of soul blues, ambient music, and the nostalgic street-wise sound of 1990’s hip-hop.|$|E

Hudgens later commented on the photos' impact on her career in the October issue of Allure with, [...] "Whenever anybody asks me, would I do nudity in a film, if I say that it's something I'm not comfortable with, they're like, 'Bullshit, you've already done it.'

While reflecting on the theatrical nature of A Fever You Can't Sweat Out touring, Urie commented [...] "We did it and {{it was a lot of}} fun when we did it, but this time around I think we wanted to get back to a more intimate, personal setting, and scale it down a little bit." [...] Ryan Ross explained that [...] "It's more about connecting with the audience and seeing what's gonna happen every night.
