5|$|At 09:00, Washington {{arrived from}} Manhattan. He {{realized}} that he had been wrong about a <b>feint</b> on Long Island and he ordered more troops to Brooklyn from Manhattan. His location on the battlefield is not known because accounts differ, but most likely he was at Brooklyn Heights where he could view the battle.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the failure}} to gain even local air superiority in the Battle of Britain, Operation Sea Lion was {{postponed}} indefinitely. Hitler and his generals {{were aware of the}} problems of an invasion. Hitler was not ideologically committed to a long war with Britain and many commentators suggest that German invasion plans were a <b>feint</b> never to be put into action.|$|E
5000|$|Deception: Strikers use <b>feints</b> or distractions to {{disguise}} the timing or direction of their attacks. Stomping the foot, noise, frequent hand movement, head movement, switching the guard position, etc. are common <b>feints.</b> Using <b>feints,</b> then attacking at multiple levels and with various techniques may help deceive the opponent, defeating their guard.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine methods of <b>feints</b> in judo {{throwing}} techniques by being based on movement structures. The participants were 11 national intercollegiate judo players and they gave demonstrations of their own favorite throwing techniques with the <b>feints.</b> A seventh-dan grade judo expert and 10 participants except for a demonstrator evaluated whether 32 demonstrations contained <b>feints</b> or not. By their agreement on each evaluation, 18 kinds of the throwing techniques with the <b>feints</b> were selected for the analysis. The impressionistic analysis by means of other-observation was conducted about the phase structures of the movement process in the throwing techniques with the <b>feints.</b> The results demonstrated that the methods of the <b>feints</b> were divided into two motions, which were Tsukuri and Kake of a certain throwing technique, and that the combination methods of the <b>feints</b> and the throwing techniques were divided into two sorts, which were the connections to either Tsukuri or Kake of the throwing techniques. Sannohe (1999) advanced a theory that judo throwing techniques could be classified into two types : rotation and non-rotation. Binomial tests indicated that when the type of the <b>feints</b> was rotation and the type of the throwing techniques was non-rotation, there was a significant difference between two combination methods : 0 connections to Tsukuri and 7 connections to Kake, and that when the type of the <b>feints</b> was non-rotation and the type of the throwing techniques was rotation, there was a significant difference between two combination methods : 8 connections to Tsukuri and 0 connections to Kake. Results are discussed with relation to practice and instruction in <b>feints</b> in judo throwing techniques...|$|R
50|$|Benrinnes {{employed}} {{some unusual}} production techniques. Between 1974 and 2007 the distillery used a unique partial triple distillation process. In this process the <b>feints</b> from the wash still, the weaker parts of <b>feints</b> {{of the spirit}} still, and the <b>feints</b> from the low wine still itself are distilled in a low wines still, while the spirit still is fed by the foreshots and {{the heart of the}} wash and low wine still, and its own foreshots and strong <b>feints.</b> The necks of the stills are cooled by worm tubs, a technique that is no longer very common.|$|R
5|$|Nearly 5,000 RAF airmen {{prepared}} {{to take part in}} 817 heavy bombers which were fueled and armed in the evening. A trigger plan was prepared, which would act as a <b>feint</b> but, this night, Bomber Command amended the <b>feint</b> which was partially compromised by weather conditions. Restrictions on the flight path of the bombers was also changed. Bomber streams were permitted to fly over Ingoldmells Point to Filey; but not over coastal areas where no ground defences were stationed. The route took them downstream to southern England by Reading, and across the English Channel, as the trigger plan required. However, they were then ordered to turn back toward the North Sea. The reason behind this was the low-lying cloud which was ever-present over the continent that night. The clouds made it difficult for pilots to see and steer clear of zones heavily guarded by Allied ground defences near to the frontline. The possibility of losing aircraft to Friendly fire was too great.|$|E
5|$|The Allied {{forces at}} Kranji {{were to be}} {{assaulted}} by the Imperial Guards Division led by Major General Takuma Nishimura. 400 Imperial Guards had landed and taken Pulau Ubin, {{an island in the}} north-east of Singapore, in a <b>feint</b> attack on 7 February, where they encountered minimal resistance.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the same}} time, to the south, Percy {{advanced}} with some 3,000 men. Percy advanced in two columns with his brigade of Hessians {{on the left}} and Percy himself leading the right. About 200 yards from the American lines Percy halted the advance, waiting for the <b>feint</b> by Stirling to take place. Facing Percy was Alexander Graydon and his company. Graydon's superior was Lambert Cadwalader, Magaw's second in command, {{who was in charge of}} holding the three defensive lines south of Fort Washington. After hearing that there was a landing on the shore in his rear, Cadwalader sent 50 men to oppose it. The 50 men ran into the <b>feint</b> by Col. Stirling's 42nd Foot of 700 men. Where Stirling landed happened to be the least defended area of the American defenses, and when Cadwalader heard how many men were there, he sent another 100 men to reinforce the 50 he had sent earlier. The British landing parties spread out, looking for a path through the rough terrain on the landing spot. The Americans took up a position on a hilltop and began firing at the British troops who were still crossing the river, killing or wounding 80 men. The British troops charged the American position, dispersing them.|$|E
5|$|In 1745, Crossford Bridge– which dated back to {{at least}} 1367– was torn down. It {{was one of a}} series of bridges {{crossing}} the River Mersey destroyed by order of the government, to slow the advance of Jacobite forces during the Jacobite rising. The Jacobites repaired the bridge upon reaching Manchester, and used it to send a small force into Sale and Altrincham. Their intention was to deceive the authorities into believing that the Jacobites were heading for Chester. The <b>feint</b> was successful and the main Jacobite army later marched south through Cheadle and Stockport instead.|$|E
5|$|In {{seventeenth century}} Spain, Lope de Vega, with a {{detailed}} knowledge of astronomy, wrote plays that ridicule astrology. In his pastoral romance La Arcadia (1598), {{it leads to}} absurdity; in his novela Guzman el Bravo (1624), he concludes that the stars were made for man, not man for the stars. Calderón de la Barca wrote the 1641 comedy Astrologo Fingido (The Pretended Astrologer); the plot was borrowed by the French playwright Thomas Corneille for his 1651 comedy <b>Feint</b> Astrologue.|$|E

5|$|In {{the extreme}} south, the six border battalions in the {{province}} of Limburg only slightly delayed the advance of the German Sixth Army; before noon the area had been overrun and the strategic city of Maastricht had surrendered, opening the way for the German <b>feint</b> offensive into Central Belgium. The Germans however, failed to capture the main bridge intact, forcing them to delay the crossing by the 4th Panzer Division until the next day.|$|E
5|$|On 23 September, General Mark W. Clark, the Commander-In-Chief of United Nations Forces in Korea, came aboard Iowa. Clark {{observed}} Iowa {{in action}} as her guns shelled the Wonsan {{area for a}} third time, accounting {{for the destruction of}} a major enemy ammunition dump. On 25 September, Iowa fired her guns at an enemy railroad and 30-car train. The following month, Iowa was part of the force involved in Operation Decoy, a <b>feint</b> to draw enemy troops into Kojo and bring them within striking distance of the battleships' big guns. During the operation, Iowa provided anti-aircraft support to , an amphibious force command ship.|$|E
5|$|Smyth {{writes that}} as a result of Husky, Hitler {{suspended}} the Kursk offensive on 13July. This was partly because of the performance of the Soviet army, but partly because he still assumed that the Allied landing on Sicily was a <b>feint</b> that preceded the invasion in the Balkans, and he wanted to have troops available for fast deployment to meet them. Smyth observes that once Hitler gave up the initiative to the Soviets, he never regained it.|$|E

It proceeded to Buna in New Guinea to rendezvous {{with most of the}} escorting destroyers and made a <b>feint</b> north toward Finschhafen before turning toward Arawe after dusk on 14December. The convoy was detected by a Japanese aircraft shortly before it anchored off Arawe at 3:30am on 15December, and the 11thAir Fleet at Rabaul began to prepare aircraft to attack it.|$|E
5|$|Together, {{they went}} to see Kutuzov, who nonchalantly gave his permission. There was no clear plan and no {{objectives}} had been drawn up, the whole manoeuvre being interpreted by both Kutuzov and Uvarov as a <b>feint.</b> Uvarov and Platov thus set off, having just around 8000 cavalrymen and 12 guns in total, and no infantry support. As Uvarov moved southwest and south and Platov moved west, they eventually arrived in the undefended rear of Viceroy Eugène's IV Corps. This was towards midday, just as the Viceroy was getting his orders to conduct another assault on the Raevski redoubt.|$|E
5|$|After the 1937 Marco Polo Bridge Incident, China and Japan {{formally}} went to war. When the Kuomintang and Communist Party {{declared a}} united front to fight the Japanese, Peng was confirmed as a general in the unified command structure of the NRA. At the August 20, 1937 Lochuan Conference(洛川会议), Mao believed that the united front should {{be used as a}} <b>feint,</b> giving token resistance to the Japanese while saving the strength of the Red Army for the eventual confrontation with the Kuomintang, but Peng, along with most other senior military and political leaders at the time, disagreed, and believed that the Red Army should genuinely focus on fighting the Japanese. Mao was not able to force his position, and the communists cooperated with the Kuomintang and fought the Japanese.|$|E

50|$|In {{association}} football, a dribble {{is one of}} {{the most}} difficult ball skills to master and one of the most useful attacking moves. In typical game play, players attempt to propel the ball toward their opponents' goal through individual control of the ball, such as by dribbling (the usage of technical maneuvers). Dribbling can involve a wide variety of manipulative tricks and <b>feints</b> in order to go past an opponent; Ronaldinho would often employ elaborate skills and <b>feints,</b> such as the elastico, in order to beat defenders.|$|R
5|$|Another {{factor was}} that, in early May 1944, an {{uncontrolled}} agent based in Spain (who sold fictional intelligence to the Germans) had passed on {{details of a}} meeting in Gibraltar between several high-ranking Allied officers. Documents found after the war indicate that the Germans found this information suspect, and may have treated Montgomery's appearance as equally so. Although double agents received several urgent requests from the Abwehr about his whereabouts {{it does not appear}} that this information was passed on to the German command in France. According to captured enemy generals, German intelligence believed that it was Montgomery, though they still guessed that it was a <b>feint.</b> The Bodyguard deception had confused the German command as to Allied intentions and the apparent arrival of Montgomery in Gibraltar added little to the picture.|$|E
5|$|At midday on 3 March 1945 {{teletype}} {{messages from}} Bomber Command Headquarters at RAF High Wycombe began reaching the airfields of RAF squadrons in Eastern England. On this night a planned raid with moderate numbers of bombers was planned over western Germany. A complex plan of <b>feint</b> attacks and diversions to deceive German air defence system were drawn up. The main force was {{split into two}} separate groups in the Münster area; No. 4 Group RAF were ordered to destroy the synthetic oil plant at Kamen and No. 5 Group RAF would attempt to eliminate the aqueduct, safety gates, and canal boats on the Dortmund–Ems Canal at Ladbergen.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the rebel}} {{victory at the}} Battle of Rijmenam in July 1578, much of the Southern Netherlands were lost to the Spanish Army during the autumn; Brussels was menaced, and the States General were moved to the safer Antwerp. Taking {{advantage}} of the Dutch rebel army's indiscipline, Farnese decided {{at the beginning of}} 1579 to besiege Maastricht. As a <b>feint</b> to distract the Dutch rebels from his goal, but also aiming to scare Antwerp's inhabitants, Farnese moved with his troops to surprise the village of Borgerhout, very close to Antwerp, where a part of the Dutch States Army had its quarters, namely 3,000 or 4,000 infantry which were the backbone of the rebel army and consisted of French Calvinists under François de la Noue, and English and Scottish troops under John Norrey's orders.|$|E
