5|$|For 6 July, Charles {{planned a}} double-envelopment {{that would require}} a quick march from the forces of his brother John, then a few {{kilometres}} {{to the east of}} the battlefield. Napoleon's plan envisaged an envelopment of the Austrian left with Davout's III Corps {{while the rest of the}} army pinned the Austrian forces. Klenau's VI Corps, supported by Kollowrat's III, opened the fighting in the second day at 4am with a crushing assault against the French left, forcing the latter to abandon both Aspern and Essling. Meanwhile, a shocking development had occurred overnight. Bernadotte had unilaterally ordered his troops out of the key and central village of Aderklaa, citing heavy artillery shelling, an act that seriously compromised the entire French position. Napoleon was livid and sent two divisions of Massena's corps supported by some cavalry to regain the critical village. After difficult fighting in the first phase, Massena sent in Molitor's reserve division, which slowly but surely grabbed all of Aderklaa back for the French, only to lose it again following fierce Austrian bombardments and counterattacks. To buy time for Davout's materialising assault, Napoleon sent 4,000 cuirassiers under Nansouty against the Austrian lines, but their efforts led to nothing. To secure his center and his left, Napoleon formed a massive artillery battery of 112 guns that began pounding at the Austrians and tearing gaping holes through their lines. As Davout's men were progressing against the Austrian left, Napoleon formed the three small divisions of MacDonald <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>hollow,</b> oblong shape that marched against the Austrian center. The lumbering phalanx was devastated by Austrian artillery but managed to break through the center, although the victory could not be exploited because there was no cavalry in the immediate area. Nevertheless, when Charles sized up the situation, he realised it was only a matter of time before the Austrian position broke completely and ordered a retreat toward Bohemia a few hours after noon. His brother John arrived on the battlefield at 4pm, too late to have any impact, and accordingly ordered a retreat to Bohemia as well.|$|E
25|$|On 3 March 1978, a McDonnell Douglas DC-8-63 {{operated}} by Iberia from Madrid–Barajas Airport with 211 passengers and 11 crew members, registration EC-BMX. The aircraft touched down {{far down the}} runway after a high approach, aquaplaned off the runway, dropped <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>hollow</b> 20m deep and caught fire. The crash was settled with 70 injured people, 10 of them seriously injured, and no fatalities.|$|E
25|$|Vasculogenesis is the {{formation}} of early vasculature, which is laid down by genetic factors. Structures called blood islands form in the mesoderm layer of the yolk sac by cellular differentiation of hemangioblasts into endothelial and red blood cells. Next, the capillary plexus forms as endothelial cells migrate outward from blood islands and form a random network of continuous strands. These strands then undergo a process called lumenization, the spontaneous rearrangement of endothelial cells from a solid cord <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>hollow</b> tube.|$|E
5000|$|The Talmud {{describes}} arrow {{heads and}} mating shafts as potentially being either male or female, {{depending on their}} construction, i.e. a prong on a male arrow head fits <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>hollowed</b> out shaft and vice versa. This is owing to a prohibition on a female shaft, from its susceptibility as a receptacle for impurity, for use as s'chach ...|$|R
60|$|The night passed very comfortably on the whole. I {{say on the}} whole, for {{personally}} I {{went through}} a most horrible nightmare of being buried alive, induced, no doubt, by the sepulchral nature of my surroundings. At dawn we were aroused by a loud trumpeting sound, produced, as we afterwards discovered, by a young Amahagger blowing through a hole bored in its side <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>hollowed</b> elephant tusk, which was kept for the purpose.|$|R

25|$|A zygote {{initially}} develops <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>hollow</b> sphere, {{called a}} blastula, which undergoes rearrangement and differentiation. In sponges, blastula larvae swim {{to a new}} location and develop into a new sponge. In most other groups, the blastula undergoes more complicated rearrangement. It first invaginates to form a gastrula with a digestive chamber, and two separate germ layers—an external ectoderm and an internal endoderm. In most cases, a mesoderm also develops between them. These germ layers then differentiate to form tissues and organs.|$|E
25|$|Itoh et al. (2003) {{developed}} a scaffold {{consisting of a}} single large longitudinally oriented channel was created using chitosan tendons from crabs. Tendons were harvested from crabs (Macrocheira kaempferi) and repeatedly washed with sodium hydroxide solution to remove proteins and to deacetylate the tendon chitin, which subsequently became known as tendon chitosan. A stainless steel bar with triangular-shaped cross-section (each side 2.1mm long) was inserted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>hollow</b> tendon chitosan tube of circular-shaped cross-section (diameter: 2mm; length: 15mm). When comparing the circular-shaped and triangular-shaped tubes, {{it was found that}} the triangular tubes had improved mechanical strength, held their shape better, and increased the surface area available. While this is an effective method for creating a single channel, it does not provide as much surface area for cellular growth as the multi-channel scaffolds.|$|E
25|$|Early in the afternoon, Napoleon ordered Jacques MacDonald's 8,000 men {{to attack}} the Austrian center. Forming his three weak {{divisions}} <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>hollow</b> square, MacDonald led his soldiers forward at {{the boundary between the}} Austrian Reserve and III Armeekorps. The French smashed into their adversaries' front, but the Austrian formations on the flanks held firm, preventing a breakthrough. Seeing MacDonald's attack stall, Napoleon sent his reserves to help. In order to halt the French attack, one Austrian grenadier brigade had wheeled to face the northern side of the square. The reinforcements took the brigade in flank and drove it back in confusion to Aderklaa, where it attempted to hold out. D'Aspré tried to rally his men but suffered a fatal wound. After the fall of their leader, his men abandoned the position. When the army retreated north after the battle, the stricken general was taken along and he died on 8 July at Mikulov (Nikolsburg) in what is now the Czech Republic. He was one of four Austrian generals killed or mortally wounded at Wagram. The others were Josef Philipp Vukassovich, Peter von Vécsey, and Nordmann.|$|E

500|$|Nanostructures of arbitrary, {{non-regular}} shapes {{are usually}} made using the DNA origami method. [...] These structures {{consist of a}} long, natural virus strand as a [...] "scaffold", which is made to fold into the desired shape by computationally designed short [...] "staple" [...] strands. This method has the advantages of being easy to design, as the base sequence is predetermined by the scaffold strand sequence, and not requiring high strand purity and accurate stoichiometry, as most other DNA nanotechnology methods do. DNA origami was first demonstrated for two-dimensional shapes, such as a smiley face and a coarse map of the Western Hemisphere. Solid three-dimensional structures {{can be made by}} using parallel DNA helices arranged in a honeycomb pattern, and structures with two-dimensional faces can be made to fold <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>hollow</b> overall three-dimensional shape, akin to a cardboard box. These can be programmed to open and reveal or release a molecular cargo in response to a stimulus, making them potentially useful as programmable molecular cages.|$|E
500|$|A spreading, densely-shading tree when mature, F.rubiginosa {{may reach}} [...] {{or more in}} height, {{although}} it rarely exceeds [...] in the Sydney region. The trunk is buttressed and can reach [...] in diameter. The bark is yellow-brown. It can also grow as on other plants as a hemiepiphyte, or [...] high lithophyte. Alternately arranged on the stems, the ovate (egg-shaped), [...] (reverse egg-shaped) or oval-shaped leaves are anywhere from [...] long and [...] wide, on -long petioles (stalks that join the leaves to stems). They are smooth or bear tiny rusty hairs. There are 16 to 62 pairs of lateral veins that run off the midvein at an angle of 41.5–84.0°, while distinct basal veins run off the midvein at an angle of 18.5–78.9°. As with all figs, the fruit (fig) is actually an inverted inflorescence (compound flower) known as a syconium, with tiny flowers arising from the fig's inner surface <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>hollow</b> cavity. F. rubiginosa is monoecious—both male and female flowers are found on the same plant, and in fact in the same fruit, although they mature at different times. Often growing in pairs, the figs are yellow initially and measure [...] across. Ripening to red in colour, they are tipped with a small nipple and on a [...] stalk. Fruits ripen throughout the year, although more so in spring and summer. Some trees have ripe and unripe fruit at the same time.|$|E
