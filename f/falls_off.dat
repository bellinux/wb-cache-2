His broom is blown away and smashed by the Whomping Willow. Working with Harry outside class, Lupin teaches him the Patronus Charm to repel Dementors.|$|E
5|$|All Puranas {{agree that}} upon {{reaching}} Varanasi, Brahma's skull <b>falls</b> <b>off</b> Bhikshatana's palm {{at a place}} now called Kapala-mochana ("liberating from the skull") and Vishaksena's corpse disappears. The sin, personified by Brahmahatya, vanishes into hell. Vishaksena is resurrected and the sanctified Bhairava-Shiva, having bathed in the sacred pond in Varanasi, casts off the appearance of Bhikshatana and returns to his abode.|$|E
5|$|The term rear wobble {{is used to}} {{describe}} a mode of oscillation in which lean angle (roll) and heading angle (yaw) are almost in phase and both 180° out of phase with steer angle. The rate of this oscillation is moderate with a maximum of about 6.5Hz. Rear wobble is heavily damped and <b>falls</b> <b>off</b> quickly as bike speed increases.|$|E

While trying to {{communicate}} with him, they end up on a subway train fighting both inside, outside, and underneath it. Finally, Spider-Man <b>falls</b> <b>off</b> the train and Connors escapes. Spider-Man returns to the lab and is given a gene cleanser from Martha which must be administered to Connors orally. He then goes off to Bronx Zoo, where Connors is reportedly at.|$|E
5|$|After {{four weeks}} of filming in Philadelphia, {{the cast and crew}} moved to Wildwood, New Jersey, which doubled for scenes set at the Atlantic City boardwalk. Filming then moved to San Francisco, California. The scene where Birdy and Al climb atop a {{refinery}} building was filmed on the rooftop of an abandoned gasworks in Hercules, California. The scene required Modine and Cage to hang {{off the edge of the}} roof secured by safety wires, while the sequence in which Birdy <b>falls</b> <b>off</b> the roof was performed by a stunt double.|$|E

On his way to Pikehold Castle, Jeremy is then ambushed by Castello. The pair fight Castello, who <b>falls</b> <b>off</b> a cliff after being defeated. Inside Pikehold Castle, Jeremy discovers that the Lords of Pikehold have become thralls to a succubus. Jeremy and Alysa defeat the Lords of Pikehold and the succubus, who informs Jeremy that the Blood Seal has been taken by a vampire mage {{to the top of}} a mountain.|$|E
50|$|Part of {{the lore}} of hubcaps {{is that on}} bad roads they have a {{tendency}} of <b>falling</b> <b>off</b> due to hitting a bump. Center caps, however, <b>fall</b> <b>off</b> less frequently than older full wheel covers, which were often quite heavy. In some parts the U.S. and in Mexico there are of automotive garages whose walls were decorated with various hubcaps that had <b>fallen</b> <b>off</b> in the vicinity; they were often for sale.|$|R

5|$|At Paramount, {{the crew}} filmed all the scenes {{that would take}} place on soundstages, {{including}} the Enterprise and Bird-of-Prey sets, the Paradise City interiors, and the campfire location. Production was smoother on set, and the crew shot scenes ahead of schedule. The crew fabricated a stand-in set for the God planet location, where additional scenes were filmed to combine with the location footage. Spock's catching of Kirk as the captain <b>falls</b> <b>off</b> El Capitan was filmed against a set that replicated the forest floor and was rotated ninety degrees.|$|E
5|$|Cyril, an eleven-year-old with a nasty {{penchant for}} making trouble, comes {{to stay at}} the Place for three months. While there, he {{frequently}} lies, sneakily torments Lad, and plays such horrible pranks on the staff that two quit. After he is caught kicking Lad in plain sight, the Master loses his temper and scolds him. Cyril goes into a rage and runs away in a snowstorm. He gets lost and <b>falls</b> <b>off</b> a high cliff, landing on a small ledge. Lad finds him there, but has to jump down to the ledge to save the boy from a bobcat. Now trapped with the boy, Lad keeps him warm until a rescue party arrives.|$|E
5|$|Enemy monsters {{inhabit the}} levels, but the player can crush them by {{flattening}} impassable blocks against them. The player may also encounter timers {{in the form}} of alarm clocks that will begin to elapse when crushed {{for the first time and}} can only be stopped when Danny jumps on them. Danny wakes from his mental explorations if he <b>falls</b> <b>off</b> the level or too high of a surface, is touched by a monster, or fails to stop a timer, but the C.R.U.S.H. device reinserts him at the start of the level or the last checkpoint Danny passed.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Soluble solids (SS), {{titratable acidity}} (TA), SS/TA ratio, pH, moisture, soluble sugars (SSU), total {{reducing}} sugars (RSU), and non-reducing sugars (NRS) were assessed in the pulp of pequi fruits collected at three ripening stages: from the plant, {{from the ground}} after naturally <b>falling</b> <b>off,</b> and collected from the ground three days after naturally <b>falling</b> <b>off.</b> The evaluation was performed {{after six months of}} freezer storage both for fruits subjected to quick freezing (liquid nitrogen followed by freezer) and slow freezing (straight into the freezer). The variables assessed were not influenced by the freezing method. The SS, TA, and RSU contents increased with the ripening stage, suggesting that the fruits collected from the plant are still immature and have lower quality than those collected after naturally <b>falling</b> <b>off.</b> Although considered mature when they <b>fall</b> <b>off,</b> fruits consumed three days after naturally <b>falling</b> <b>off</b> have better quality...|$|R

5|$|Fruit bodies {{arise from}} the tips or the lateral {{branches}} or rhizomorphs. New fruit bodies are made of an exterior of thick hyphae {{similar to those found}} in the rhizomorph core; in contrast, the hyphae of the interior originate from the puffball's core. Unlike some other puffball species, the peridium does not differentiate into a distinct exoperidium and endoperidium; rather, the outer layer develops the features of a pseudoparenchyma (a tightly organised tissue where the tightly packed cells resemble plant parenchyma) as the radial and tangential hyphae become interweaved. In time, the peridium dries and <b>falls</b> <b>off</b> in flakes to expose the underlying gleba.|$|E
5|$|Nearly a {{year after}} the events of the movie, Elsa throws a {{birthday}} for Anna. However Anna discovers, through Elsa's continuous sneezing that Elsa has caught a cold. Despite trying to make the party perfect for her sister, Elsa's sneezes create tiny snowmen which try to take the cake for themselves, and she nearly <b>falls</b> <b>off</b> the clocktower due to her condition. Afterwards Anna takes Elsa to rest and feeds her soup, while Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf help transport the snowmen to Elsa's ice palace in the mountains.|$|E
5|$|Smallpox is not notably {{infectious}} in the prodromal {{period and}} viral shedding is usually delayed until {{the appearance of}} the rash, which is often accompanied by lesions in the mouth and pharynx. The virus can be transmitted throughout the course of the illness, but is most frequent {{during the first week of}} the rash, when most of the skin lesions are intact. Infectivity wanes in 7 to 10 days when scabs form over the lesions, but the infected person is contagious until the last smallpox scab <b>falls</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Baker {{explosion}} ejected {{into the}} environment about twice as many free neutrons as there were fission events. A plutonium fission event produces, on average, 2.9 neutrons, {{most of which are}} consumed in the production of more fission, until fission <b>falls</b> <b>off</b> and the remaining uncaptured neutrons escape. In an air burst, most of these environmental neutrons are absorbed by superheated air which rises into the stratosphere, along with the fission products and unfissioned plutonium. In the underwater Baker detonation, the neutrons were captured by seawater in the lagoon.|$|E
5|$|Elsa {{plans to}} give Anna a {{surprise}} birthday party {{with the help}} of Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf; but while Anna is led on a party treasure hunt by a string that winds through the kingdom, Elsa has caught a cold, and unknowingly produces a group of small living snowmen with each sneeze, who begin to dismantle the birthday party's decorations while Kristoff tries to stop them. While Elsa takes Anna on the hunt, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf try to control the snowmen and fix the decorations in time for Anna and Elsa's return. After Elsa nearly <b>falls</b> <b>off</b> a clock tower, Anna convinces her to take rest. While Anna enjoys the party, Elsa sneezes a giant snowball through an alphorn, inadvertently stunning Hans overseas; whereupon Elsa rests in bed under Anna's care. Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven escort the small snowmen to Elsa's ice palace, where they stay with her snow-giant doorkeeper Marshmallow.|$|E
5|$|Fast {{transient}} response and low distortion are both characteristic of electrostatics. The driver, being only 0.00137-inch thick and weighing only 3mg, is thus capable of stopping and starting seemingly instantaneously with no damping {{necessary to the}} drive units. However, the design also limits bandwidth to between 40Hz and 10kHz. Kohli of TNT noted that upper register starts to taper above 10kHz and then <b>falls</b> <b>off</b> severely beyond 13kHz, and is 15-20dB down at 20kHz. The speaker's design makes them extremely directional, and the general practice is to toe in the speakers to point directly to the listener. Although a slight deviation {{did not seem to}} make a difference, it is in practice not possible for more than one person to enjoy a reasonably balanced sound stage with the ESL.|$|E

5|$|Icings – Roofs {{must also}} be {{designed}} to avoid ice dams, which result from meltwater running under the snow {{on the roof and}} freezing at the eave. Ice dams on roofs form when accumulated snow on a sloping roof melts and flows down the roof, under the insulating blanket of snow, until it reaches below freezing temperature air, typically at the eaves. When the meltwater reaches the freezing air, ice accumulates, forming a dam, and snow that melts later cannot drain properly through the dam. Ice dams may result in damaged building materials or in damage or injury when the ice dam <b>falls</b> <b>off</b> or from attempts to remove ice dams. The melting results from heat passing through the roof under the highly insulating layer of snow.|$|E
5|$|Bhairava {{then takes}} Mithra, his soldiers, and his caretakers to the Bhairavakona temple atop a cliff to seek blessings from God. Mithra demands Bhairava admit {{his love for}} her. When he does not respond, she upsets the sacred items they have brought for the puja and, using her own blood, paints an image on a nearby rock of Bhairava leaving his true love to do his duty. An injured soldier arrives to tell Bhairava that Ranadev and Sher Khan's army have killed Vikram Singh and are now rushing toward them. They arrive shortly, and Sher Khan {{challenges}} Bhairava to battle his soldiers. Bhairava boldly accepts the challenge and kills a hundred soldiers, but is severely injured in the process. Sher Khan, impressed by Bhairava's bravery, has a change of heart. However, Ranadev continues attacking, eventually wounding Mithra fatally, but he is in turn killed by Bhairava. A dying Mithra asks Bhairava to confess his love, but before he can respond, she dies and <b>falls</b> <b>off</b> the cliff. Distraught, he follows her and falls to his own death.|$|E
5|$|Donna {{is taken}} to a dying TARDIS, which UNIT has managed to use as {{the core of a}} crude time machine. Rose uses energy from the TARDIS to show Donna the beetle on her back, but tells her they do not know what it is. She insists that Donna travel back to the day she made the fateful turn and choose to turn left again. Donna is transported back minutes before she would make that turn, but too far away to contact her past self in time. She makes the {{decision}} to walk out in front of a passing truck and let it hit her, creating a traffic jam that causes her past self to turn left out of impatience. As Donna lies on the ground dying, Rose whispers a message into her ear for the Doctor. The alternate universe disappears, and Donna finds herself back on Shan Shen. The beetle <b>falls</b> <b>off</b> of Donna's back, and the fortune teller runs away after uttering some terrified words about what Donna will become.|$|E
