40|$|The {{communication}} {{presents the}} partial {{results of a}} research proposing the social contract as a new instrument of analysis for the <b>employment</b> <b>relation</b> in a social context in change, such as the case of Rumania. Until then, the research which aimed at the <b>employment</b> <b>relation</b> which is formed between the employer and the employees widely appealed {{to the concept of}} psychological contract (Rousseau, 1989; 1995). The psychological contract, defined as the perception of the mutual obligations assumed by the employee and by the employer, benefited from a fashion effect in the 1990 s, when the economic difficulties questioned the model of classic <b>employment</b> <b>relation</b> based on loyalty. However, most of the empirical works on the psychological contract are static studies, for the greater part elaborated by questionnaire, which do not allow to define the impact of the social context change on the evolution of the <b>employment</b> <b>relation.</b> Although certain studies are interested in a context of change (Dick, 2010), most of the past works describe the contents and the evaluation of the psychological contract in an unchanging social environment. Yet, we saw it {{in the case of the}} ex-communist countries or those of the Northern Africa, the change in the environment of the <b>employment</b> <b>relation</b> is more present than ever. Our communication proposes a research frame which would be more suited to the understanding of the <b>employment</b> <b>relation</b> in a society in change. To do it, we rely on the social contract in management, which we define as the ensemble of the norms and of the tacit laws existing in a society or a group given with regard to the <b>relation</b> of <b>employment.</b> The approach by the social contract presents the advantage of including multiple elements bound to a societal context, such as the laws, the national culture, the faiths shared by the business environment, etc. (Rousseau, 1995). It offers a new frame of analysis for the <b>employment</b> <b>relation</b> by suggesting that it is through the systematic and global vision of the values and standards relating to the <b>employment</b> <b>relation,</b> that we can better comprehend the consequences of a change of the <b>employment</b> <b>relation.</b> Given its exploratory character, we use an inductive, thus qualitative, methodology, to perform this research. The partial results of the analysis of the interviews led in two Romanian companies during the summer of 2010 allowed us to identify several components, which we called "terms" of the social contract. These results will deliver to the practitioners and to the researchers in management a relevant tool to better understand the <b>relation</b> of <b>employment</b> in different national cultures as well as a measuring instrument for the quality of the employee-employer relation. Our communication ends by proposing various paths of reflection which will allow to use this approach in future researches concerning the <b>employment</b> <b>relation...</b>|$|R

25|$|Acknowledging {{that the}} changes in the {{national}} economy in the past two hundred years had transformed Congress' Commerce Clause power from being a marginal power that served mostly to mediate between the states by eliminating interstate tariffs and other burdens on interstate commerce into a general power that gave Congress essentially unlimited power to regulate in every area of economic life, O'Connor argued for special limitations on this power to protect the states' authority over their own <b>employment</b> <b>relations.</b> She invoked the limiting language of the most expansive interpretations of the Commerce Clause in the Court's decisions of the 1930s and 1940s to argue that the Court retained the power to decide whether a particular exercise of the Commerce Clause authority was necessary and proper to the federal purposes to be achieved. Applying that standard, she, joined by Justices Powell and Rehnquist, would find the FLSA unconstitutional as applied to employees of state and local governments.|$|E
25|$|The Court also {{rejected}} the theoretical underpinnings of the National League of Cities v. Usery decisionthat the Constitution's {{recognition of the}} sovereignty of the states necessarily implies limits on the power of the federal government to regulate their <b>employment</b> <b>relations.</b> In the majority's view, the constitutional grant of authority to Congress to regulate interstate commerce was not qualified by any implied limitation on the right to regulate the activities of the states when they engaged in interstate commerce; on the contrary, the Commerce Clause invalidates state regulations that interfere with commerce, while the Supremacy Clause allows Congress to preempt state laws that conflict with federal law in this area. According to the majority, the framers believed that state sovereignty could be maintained by the peculiar structure they adopted: a Senate in which each state was given equal representation, regardless of its population, an electoral college that gave the states the power to choose electors, and the indirect election of Senators by the legislature of each state prior to the adoption of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Noting that the same Congress that extended the FLSA to cover government-run mass transit systems also provided substantial funding for those systems, the Court concluded that the structure created by the framers had indeed protected the states from overreaching by the federal government.|$|E
25|$|From 1979, a new Conservative {{government}} took a strongly sceptical policy to {{all forms of}} labour law and regulation. During the 1980s ten major Acts gradually reduced the autonomy of trade unions and the legality of industrial action. Reforms to the internal structure of unions mandated that representatives be elected and a ballot is taken before a strike, that no worker could strike in sympathetic secondary action with workers with a different employer, and that employers could not run a closed shop system of requiring all workers to join the recognised union. The wage councils were dismantled. A public campaign against the merits of unions paralleled the decline of membership and collective agreement coverage to under 40 per cent. In addition, the government opted out of the EU Social Chapter in the Maastricht Treaty. In 1997 the new Labour government brought the UK into the EU's Social Chapter, which {{has served as the}} source for most reform in UK law since that time. Domestic led reform was minimal. The National Minimum Wage Act 1998 established a country-wide minimum wage, but did not attempt to reinvigorate the Wage Board system. The <b>Employment</b> <b>Relations</b> Act 1999 introduced a 60-page procedure requiring employers to compulsorily recognise and bargain with a union holding support among workers, though union membership remained at a level steadily declining below 30 per cent.|$|E
40|$|What kind of {{economic}} activity is conducted through markets and what kind is conducted through firms? We approach this Coaseian question by way of an <b>employment</b> <b>relation</b> between players. Every players has an endowment of 100 % of his time. He may choose to give away part of his time to other players. We will work the <b>employment</b> <b>relation</b> into characteristic functions (cooperative game theory). Here, one can proceed via Owen’s (1970) multilinear extension. However, we prefer the minimum extension. For two agents, we find (as Coase suggested) that firms spring up in response to market inefficiencies and that markets will prevail if organizational inefficiencies are profound. More specificly, cross employment (one agent employing the other and vice versa) may well happen. Also, the more productive agent {{is more likely to}} employ the less productive one than the other way around...|$|R

500|$|Labour Party {{president}} Moira Coatsworth {{stated that}} the leadership contest would be a [...] "robust contest of ideas", and suggested to the party's caucus that {{a series of meetings}} with party members be held around New Zealand. These were held from 6 to 11 December in six major cities—Hamilton, Palmerston North, Wellington, Christchurch, Dunedin and Auckland. The party membership was then encouraged to give feedback to the party caucus, who would vote in the election. On 30 November Cunliffe, Parker and Shearer were interviewed by Mark Sainsbury on the current affairs programme Close Up. The television show held a text message poll in which viewers voted for their preferred leader of the party. Over 7,500 people took part; Shearer received 50% of the support, Cunliffe 31% and Parker 19%. The following day, Parker pulled out of the leadership race and put his support behind Shearer. Shearer and Cunliffe were interviewed by Guyon Espiner on political talkshow Q+A on 4 December. During the interview, both candidates indicated their support for the introduction of a capital gains tax, which was a key part of Labour's tax policy during the 2011 general election campaign. Both also disagreed with the 2008 <b>Employment</b> <b>Relations</b> Amendment Act (90-day workplace trial), and wanted New Zealand to invest further in research and development; Shearer mentioned striving for a more green economy. On 9 December, Horizon Research released a demographically-weighted survey which found that 35.4% of adult New Zealanders supported Shearer's bid for the leadership, and 19.9% backed Cunliffe.|$|E
500|$|Testing {{before the}} onset of {{symptoms}} is a life-changing event and a very personal decision. The main reason given for choosing testing for HD is to aid in career and family decisions. Before 1993 there was not an available test for individuals to learn if they carried the Huntington's gene. At that time surveys indicated that 50–70% of at-risk individuals would have been interested in receiving testing, but since predictive testing has been offered far fewer choose to be tested. Over 95% of individuals at risk of inheriting HD do not proceed with testing, mostly because there is no treatment. A key issue is the anxiety an individual experiences about not knowing whether they will eventually develop HD, compared to the impact of a positive result. Irrespective of the result, stress levels {{have been found to be}} lower two years after being tested, but the risk of suicide is increased after a positive test result. Individuals found to have not inherited the disorder may experience survivor guilt with regard to family members who are affected. Other factors taken into account when considering testing include the possibility of discrimination and the implications of a positive result, which usually means a parent has an affected gene and that the individual's siblings will be at risk of inheriting it. In one study genetic discrimination was found in 46% of individuals at risk for Huntington's disease. It occurred at higher rates within personal relationships than health insurance or <b>employment</b> <b>relations.</b> [...] Genetic counseling in HD can provide information, advice and support for initial decision-making, and then, if chosen, throughout all stages of the testing process. Because of the implications of this test, patients who wish to undergo testing must complete three counseling sessions which provide information about Huntington's.|$|E
