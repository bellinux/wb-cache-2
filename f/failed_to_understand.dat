40|$|This paper {{discusses}} Bernard Williams's famous case of Jim and the Indians. It contrasts {{two ways}} of diagnosing the alleged errors of Act Utilitarianism in considering this case. One approach suggests that Act Utilitarianism <b>fails</b> <b>to</b> appreciate the importance of what Jim does; it <b>fails</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the significance of Jim's agency. This paper favours an alternative diagnosis, according to which Act Utilitarianism <b>fails</b> <b>to</b> appreciate the importance of what Pedro could do; it <b>fails</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the significance of Pedro's agency...|$|R

In the footage Dion repeatedly <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the conditional perfect construction used by the interviewer in a single repeatedly asked question.|$|E
25|$|Contact with colonizing groups {{brought about}} a {{considerable}} transformation in the way indigenous peoples of Melanesia have thought about other societies. Early theories of cargo cults began from the assumption that practitioners simply <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> technology, colonization, or capitalist reform; in this model, cargo cults are a misunderstanding of the systems involved in resource distribution and an attempt to acquire such goods {{in the wake of}} interrupted trade. However, many of these practitioners actually focus on the importance of sustaining and creating new social relationships, with material relations being secondary.|$|E
25|$|Ptolemy later {{measured}} the lunar parallax directly (Almagest V.13), {{and used the}} second method of Hipparchus with lunar eclipses to compute {{the distance of the}} Sun (Almagest V.15). He criticizes Hipparchus for making contradictory assumptions, and obtaining conflicting results (Almagest V.11): but apparently he <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> Hipparchus's strategy to establish limits consistent with the observations, rather than a single value for the distance. His results were the best so far: the actual mean distance of the Moon is 60.3 Earth radii, within his limits from Hipparchus's second book.|$|E

25|$|Abrahams spent around 10 {{weeks in}} 1946 in Nyasaland taking {{evidence}} from colonial officials, estate owners and settlers, African politicians and chiefs and missionaries, visiting almost {{all parts of}} the protectorate. He submitted his report in October 1946 and it was published in early 1947. Abrahams identified the main problem as the conflicting African and European concepts of land ownership. In addition, many European landowners either acted illegally towards tenants or exercised their rights harshly and without consideration of customary practices. In part, this was because the system set up following the 1928 Natives on Private Estates Ordinance neither provided the owners with a reliable pool of labour nor enabled them to reduce the numbers living on their estates. Many African tenants, in Abrahams’ view, <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> their obligations or the limits on their legal rights. Many Africans living on Native Trust Land felt strong resentment at the large areas of under-used estate land.|$|E
25|$|On 14 October, Egypt began {{a limited}} {{offensive}} against Israel for political reasons. Sadat needed Assad {{on his side}} for his peace policy with Israel to succeed, and military action was {{a means to an}} end. The renewed Egyptian military offensive was ill-conceived. A week later, due to Egyptian inactivity, the Israelis had organised and the Arabs had lost their most important advantage. While the military offensive gave Assad hope, this was an illusion; the Arabs had already lost the war militarily. Egypt's behavior during the war caused friction between Assad and Sadat. Assad, still inexperienced in foreign policy, believed that the Egyptian–Syrian alliance was based on trust and <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> Egypt's duplicity. Although it was not until after the war that Assad would learn that Sadat was in contact with American National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger almost daily during the war, the seeds of distrust had been sown. Around this time, Sadat called for an American-led ceasefire agreement between Egypt, Syria and Israel; however, he was unaware that under Kissinger's tenure the United States had become a staunch supporter of Israel.|$|E
25|$|At her {{mortuary}} temple, in Osirian statues that regaled {{the transportation}} of the pharaoh {{to the world}} of the dead, the symbols of the pharaoh as the deity Osiris were the reason for the attire and they were much more important to be displayed traditionally, her breasts are obscured behind her crossed arms holding the regal staffs of the two kingdoms she ruled. This became a pointed concern among writers who sought reasons for the generic style of the shrouded statues and led to misinterpretations. Understanding of the religious symbolism was required to interpret the statues correctly. Interpretations by these early scholars varied and often, were baseless conjectures of their own contemporary values. The possible reasons for her breasts not being emphasized in the most formal statues were debated among some early Egyptologists, who <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the ritual religious symbolism, to take into account the fact that many women and goddesses portrayed in ancient Egyptian art often lack delineation of breasts, and that the physical aspect of the gender of pharaohs was never stressed in the art. With few exceptions, subjects were idealized.|$|E

25|$|Since the Army {{was officially}} {{responsible}} {{for the security of}} the Pearl Harbor facilities and Hawaiian defense generally, and so of the Navy's ships while in port, Army actions are of particular interest. Short reported to Washington he had increased his alert level (but his earlier change in meaning for those levels was not understood in Washington and led to misunderstanding there about what he was really doing). In addition, Short's main concern was sabotage from fifth columnists (expected to precede the outbreak of war for decades preceding the attack), which accounts for his orders that Army Air Corps planes be parked close together {{near the center of the}} airfields. There seems to have been no increased Army urgency about getting its existing radar equipment properly integrated with the local command and control in the year it had been available and operational in Hawaii before the attack. Leisurely radar training continued and the recently organized early warning center was left minimally staffed. Anti-aircraft guns remained in a state of low readiness, with ammunition in secured lockers. Neither Army long-range bombers nor Navy PBYs were used effectively, remaining on a peacetime maintenance and use schedule. Short evidently <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> he had the responsibility to defend the fleet. In Short's defense, it should be noted he had training responsibilities to meet, and the best patrol aircraft, B-17s and B-24s, were in demand in the Philippines and Britain, both of which had higher priority.|$|E

500|$|Howe {{has been}} criticised by contemporaries and historians {{for failing to}} decisively defeat the Continental Army during the New York {{campaign}}. [...] Contemporaries complained that his landing in Westchester failed to trap Washington, but <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that his goal in the campaign was to secure Manhattan, and not necessarily to defeat Washington. However, historian George Billias observes that Howe's overly rigid adherence to his plans meant that {{he was unable to}} capitalise on the opportunities that arose during the campaign for a decisive action.|$|E
