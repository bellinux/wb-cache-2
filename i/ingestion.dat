5|$|Lead {{exposure}} {{is a global}} issue since lead mining and smelting, and battery manufacturing/disposal/recycling, are common in many countries. Lead enters the body via inhalation, <b>ingestion,</b> or skin absorption. Almost all inhaled lead is absorbed into the body; for <b>ingestion,</b> the rate is 20–70%, with children absorbing a higher percentage than adults.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{attention}} should be sought in cases of suspected poisoning. If the delay between <b>ingestion</b> and treatment is less than four hours, activated charcoal is given.

40|$|AbstractForeign body <b>ingestions</b> in {{children}} and adolescents can pose significant challenge both in terms of diagnosis and treatment. The pediatric scientific literature is relatively scarce and consists mostly of case reports and small case series, therefore making firm guidelines and management recommendations rather difficult. The type of <b>ingestions</b> seen may vary in different countries and it changes over time depending on implementation of safety measures, or introduction of new products. Lately, there has been {{a significant increase in the}} incidence of high-powered multiple magnet, and large disc battery <b>ingestions.</b> Both of these are associated with potentially serious complications including fatal outcomes. This paper briefly discusses some of the important aspects of critical foreign body <b>ingestions,</b> proposed management algorithms, and efforts necessary to increase public awareness in order to minimize complications and improve prevention...|$|R

Limited informa-tion exists on adult metformin <b>ingestions</b> reported to poi-son control centers. The distribution of adult metformin <b>ingestions</b> reported to Texas poison control centers dur-ing 2000 – 2006 was determined for various factors. In addition, triage guidelines for {{the management}} of isolated <b>ingestions</b> were drafted. Of 1528 total metformin inges-tions, 58 % involved coingestants. Of the 264 <b>ingestions</b> of metformin alone, where the final medical outcome was known, dose ingested was reported for 66 %. The mean reported dose was 4739 mg (range 500 – 60, 000 mg). <b>Ingestions</b> of ≤ 2500 mg and> 5000 mg reported doses differed with respect to the proportion involving suspected attempted suicide (6 % versus 81 %), serious final medical outcome (3 % versus 19 %), and referral to a health care facility (3 % versus 83 %).

5|$|Little {{comprehensive}} {{data regarding}} rumination syndrome in otherwise healthy individuals exists because most sufferers are private about their illness {{and are often}} misdiagnosed due {{to the number of}} symptoms and the clinical similarities between rumination syndrome and other disorders of the stomach and esophagus, such as gastroparesis and bulimia nervosa. These symptoms include the acid-induced erosion of the esophagus and enamel, halitosis, malnutrition, severe weight loss and an unquenchable appetite. Individuals may begin regurgitating within a minute following <b>ingestion,</b> and the full cycle of <b>ingestion</b> and regurgitation can mimic the binging and purging of bulimia.|$|E

Soil can be contaminated through particulate accumulation from lead in pipes, lead paint, and residual emissions from leaded gasoline.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary care {{consists}} of gastric decontamination with either activated carbon or gastric lavage. However, {{due to the}} delay between <b>ingestion</b> and the first symptoms of poisoning, it is commonplace for patients to arrive for treatment long after <b>ingestion,</b> potentially reducing the efficacy of these interventions. Supportive measures are directed towards treating the dehydration which results from fluid loss during the gastrointestinal phase of intoxication and correction of metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalances, and impaired coagulation.|$|E

50|$|The primary {{mechanism}} of injury with button battery <b>ingestions</b> is the generation of hydroxide ions, which cause severe chemical burns, at the anode. This is an electrochemical effect of the intact battery, and {{does not require the}} casing to be breached or the contents released. Complications include oesophageal strictures, Tracheo-oesophageal fistulas, vocal cord paralysis, aorto-oesophageal fistulas, and death. The majority of <b>ingestions</b> are not witnessed; presentations are non-specific; battery voltage has increased; the 20 to 25 mm button battery size are more likely to become lodged at the cricopharyngeal junction; and severe tissue damage can occur within 2 hours. The 3 V, 20 mm CR2032 lithium battery has been implicated in many of the complications from button battery <b>ingestions</b> by children of less than 4 years of age.Button batteries can also cause significant necrotic injury when stuck in the nose or ears.|$|R

5|$|The first {{reported}} poisonings resulting in death from {{the consumption of}} A.bisporigera were from near San Antonio, Mexico, in 1957, where a rancher, his wife, and three children consumed the fungus; only the man survived. Amanita poisoning {{is characterized by the}} following distinct stages: the incubation stage is an asymptomatic period which ranges from 6 to 12 hours after <b>ingestion.</b> In the gastrointestinal stage, about 6 to 16 hours after <b>ingestion,</b> there is onset of abdominal pain, explosive vomiting, and diarrhea for up to 24 hours, which may lead to dehydration, severe electrolyte imbalances, and shock. These early symptoms may be related to other toxins such as phalloidin. In the cytotoxic stage, 24 to 48 hours after <b>ingestion,</b> clinical and biochemical signs of liver damage are observed, but the patient is typically free of gastrointestinal symptoms. The signs of liver dysfunction such as jaundice, hypoglycemia, acidosis, and hemorrhage appear. Later, there is an increase in the levels of prothrombin and blood levels of ammonia, and the signs of hepatic encephalopathy and/or kidney failure appear. The risk factors for mortality that have been reported are age younger than 10 years, short latency period between <b>ingestion</b> and onset of symptoms, severe coagulopathy (blood clotting disorder), severe hyperbilirubinemia (jaundice), and rising serum creatinine levels.|$|E
5|$|Treatment for {{antifreeze}} poisoning {{needs to}} be started as soon after <b>ingestion</b> as possible to be effective; the earlier treatment is started, the greater the chance of survival. Cats must be treated within 3 hours of ingesting of antifreeze to be effective, while dogs must be treated within 8–12 hours of <b>ingestion.</b> Once kidney failure develops, the prognosis is poor.|$|E
5|$|A person's {{history of}} taking {{paracetamol}} is somewhat accurate for the diagnosis. The {{most effective way}} to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level. A drug nomogram developed in 1975, called the Rumack-Matthew nomogram, estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after <b>ingestion.</b> To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity, the paracetamol level is traced along the nomogram. Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the nomogram appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury. A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after <b>ingestion</b> may underestimate the amount in the system because paracetamol may still be {{in the process of being}} absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, a serum level taken before 4hours is not recommended.|$|E
50|$|Although {{plans of}} {{building}} an airport near Concepción {{date back to}} 1954, construction began only in 1960, shortly after the 22 May earthquake, as it became imperative to count with a modern airport to link Chile's south-central region {{with the rest of}} the country. The airport was finally opened to the public on 3 January 1968.No airline accidents have been recorded in relation with the airport, although bird <b>ingestions</b> during takeoff have occurred causing rejected takeoffs or emergency returns from departing aircraft. No casualties derived from such bird <b>ingestions</b> have been recorded.|$|R

40|$|More than 5, 000 caustic <b>ingestions</b> are {{estimated}} to occur each year. Liquid lye {{is associated with the}} greatest morbidity. Endoscopy is the only method for evaluating the extent of the injury; clinical signs and symptoms (e. g., vomiting, dysphagia, abdominal pain, oral burns, leukocytosis) are not reliable. In less severe burns (involving only mucosal irritation or ulceration), current therapy with antibiotics and steroids results in a very favorable prognosis. Circumferential or very deep burns have a much poorer outcome, with a greatly increased risk of stricture formation and/ or perforation. The risk of developing esophageal carcinoma may be 1, 000 times greater for in-dividuals who have had a lye burn than in the general population. It cannot be overemphasized that prevention is still the key to decreasing this morbidity.

40|$|Background: Caustic <b>ingestions</b> {{are rare}} but {{potentially}} life-threatening events requiring multidisciplinary emergency approaches. Although particularly respiratory functions may be impaired after caustic <b>ingestions,</b> studies involving acute emergency care are scarce. The {{goal of this}} study was to explore acute emergency care with respect to airway management and emergency department (ED) infrastructures. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated adult patients after caustic <b>ingestions</b> admitted to our university hospital over a 10 -year period (2005 – 2014). Prognostic analysis included age, morbidity, ingested agent, airway management, interventions (endoscopy findings, computed tomography (CT), surgical procedures), intensive care unit (ICU) admission, length of stay in hospital and hospital mortality. Results: Twenty-eight patients with caustic <b>ingestions</b> were included in the analysis of which 18 (64 %) had suicidal intentions. Ingested agents were caustic alkalis (n = 22; 79 %) and acids (n = 6; 21 %). ICU admission was required in 20 patients (71 %). Fourteen patients (50 %) underwent tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, of which 3 (21 %) presented with difficult airways. Seven patients (25 %) underwent tracheotomy including one requiring awake tracheotomy due to progressive upper airway obstruction. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed in 21 patients (75 %) and 11 (39 %) underwent CT examination. Five patients (18 %) required emergency surgery with a mortality of 60 %. Overall hospital mortality was 18 % whereas the need for tracheal intubation (P = 0. 012), CT-diagnostic (P = 0. 001), higher EGD score (P = 0. 006), tracheotomy (P = 0. 048), and surgical interventions (P = 0. 005) were significantly associated with mortality. Conclusions: Caustic <b>ingestions</b> in adult patients require an ED infrastructure providing 24 / 7 -availability of expertise in establishing emergent airway safety, endoscopic examination (EGD and bronchoscopy), and CT diagnostic, intensive care and emergency esophageal surgery. We recommend that - even in patients with apparently stable clinical conditions - careful monitoring of respiratory functions should be considered as long as diagnostic work-up is completed...|$|R
