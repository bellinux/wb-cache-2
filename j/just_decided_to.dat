5|$|Nevertheless, other historians like Masahiro Yamamoto {{have argued}} that the death {{sentence}} was too severe a penalty for Matsui's crime of mere negligence in failing to stop the massacre. The journalist Richard Minear also points out that Matsui's penalty was disproportionately severe compared to the other convicted defendants. Kuniaki Koiso was found guilty on four counts and Mamoru Shigemitsu was found guilty on five counts, in both cases including one count of negligence, and both were given prison sentences. Matsui, by contrast, was found guilty of only one count of negligence but was sentenced to death. The historian Tokushi Kasahara argues that the prosecution at the IMTFE did not attempt seriously to investigate all those {{who were involved in the}} Nanking Massacre, and instead <b>just</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> make Matsui the sole scapegoat for the whole atrocity.|$|E

Many people chose the names of the ancient clans and tribes such Borjigin, Besud, Jalair, etc. Also many {{extended}} families chose the names of the native places of their ancestors. Some chose the names of their most ancient known ancestor. Some <b>just</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> pass their own given names (or modifications of their given names) to their descendants as clan names. Some chose other attributes of their lives as surnames. Gürragchaa chose Sansar (Cosmos). Clan names precede the patronymics and given names, e.g. Besud Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj. These clan names have a significance and are included in Mongolian passports.|$|E

500|$|While {{the name}} of the anti-Hulk armor, usually {{referred}} to as the [...] "Hulkbuster" [...] in comic books, is not spoken in the film, its deployment system and containment cell are code-named [...] "Veronica".

When {{listening}} to the sultry undertones and R influences threaded throughout it, you come to realize how flawlessly the singer could change up her persona while still sounding genuine". Gracie believed that Bedtime Stories was an album with [...] "timeless sound" [...] and signified an evolution of Madonna as an artist, acting as the front-runner to her more experimental album like Ray of Light (1998). However she noted how the album never {{let go of the}} sexual provocation associated with Madonna and how the singer chose to turn against what people expected from her at that time—being apologetic.|$|E
500|$|... "Exit" [...] {{was created}} {{on the final}} day of {{recording}} for The Joshua Tree. It developed from a lengthy jam that the band recorded in a single take.

[...] Producer Brian Eno edited the jam down to the end length. Guitarist the Edge said, [...] "it started off as an exercise in playing together with a kind of mood and a place in mind. And it really, for me, it brought me there, it really did succeed as an experiment." [...] Lanois said: [...] "There's something that happens when U2 bash it out in the band room... and sometimes things get out of control, sonically, in a good way. Out of control in the sense that you don't know what it is anymore, it just takes on a life of its own, and it makes people do things." ...|$|E

In a review for The New York Times, Kelefa Sanneh {{noted that the}} track [...] "successfully conjure up the infectious spirit of early Madonna." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly called the song [...] "a pricey retro fashion blurb" [...] on which Stefani appears as [...] "an old-school, gold-chained rapper". Krissi Murison of the NME disagreed, calling it one of [...] "the best bits of the decade of decadence" [...] and referring to it as [...] "Salt-N-Pepa's cartoon rap". Jason Shawhan of About.com stated that the song's [...] "great Narada Michael Walden bleepy synth noises [...] pop out of the mix like the car stereo <b>just</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> sing along", and Jennifer Nine of Yahoo! Music commented that the track had [...] "icy-cool schoolyard sass". Eric Greenwood of Drawer B argued that the track [...] "carelessly revisits Stefani's blatant fondness for 80's pop, but not even [...] Tony Kanal can save her from lifeless retreads like these." [...] The Washington Post reviewer Sean Daly compared it to Salt-n-Pepa's 1987 single [...] "Push It" [...] and added that Stefani [...] "pushes it real good". PopMatters's Jason Damas gave it a very strong review, stating that [...] "Stefani nails all the vocal mannerisms" [...] and that Kanal [...] "reveals a major mainstream pop jones here, especially {{in the way he}} layers the cut [...] with dozens of orchestra hits [...] which have been absent from almost all pop albums for a decade or more now." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine gave the song a mixed review, stating that it [...] "features some near-fatal car metaphors" [...] but that Stefani [...] "maintains her signature sass throughout".|$|E

Heat balling is a unique defense system in which several hundred bees surround the wasp in a tight ball and vibrate their muscles in an effort to produce heat and effectively kill the wasp inside. Alternatively, however, {{in the presence of a}} wasp, the bees may also just withdraw into their nests and await the heat-balling circumstances to develop naturally. Furthermore, other bees may <b>just</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> fly away as an evasive measure in times of conflict, often altering their specific flight styles in order to avoid predation.|$|R

2500|$|The {{review was}} devastating, and I wasn't clever enough to {{understand}} or use the possible notoriety attached to that performance (after all, obviously no one was bored) in a positive career move.

When Schabowski was asked when this epoch-making freedom would take effect, he glanced through his notes, then said, [...] "sofort, unverzüglich" [...] ("immediately, without delay"), touching off a stampede of East Berliners to the Wall.

2500|$|Some {{elements}} of Yousef's story have been questioned.

He <b>just</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> {{write a book about}} it." [...] The conversion to Christianity narrative promoted by Yousef and his book publishers remains unsubstantiated as well. Critics have alleged that Yousef claimed he was a Christian (for a longer period of time) in order to help secure asylum in the United States. This tactic is common for Muslim immigrants seeking to avoid deportation to countries where apostasy laws exist. However, he has since become an active figure in evangelical non-denominational Christianity in America, and has appeared on programs such as the 700 Club. Interest in the book from Christian readers helped make it a New York Times best-seller.|$|E
2500|$|No {{conceptual}} {{music videos}} {{ended up being}} made to promote Invitation to the Dance, {{in part due to}} issues with the band's troubled label London-Sire.

Max Illidge stated in 2002 [...] "We could have made a video for it and maybe if the video was shocking enough it would have given us a bigger push, but London-Sire <b>just</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> scrap [...] "Falling Down" [...] and go with [...] "Wither Away" [...] for the video.
