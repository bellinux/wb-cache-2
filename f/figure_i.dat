500|$|Upon {{the death}} of Mao Zedong in 1976, Benn {{described}} Mao as [...] "one of the greatest – if not the greatest – figures of the twentieth century: a schoolteacher who transformed China, released it from civil war and foreign attack and constructed a new society there" [...] in his diaries, adding that [...] "he certainly towers above any twentieth-century <b>figure</b> <b>I</b> can think of in his philosophical contribution and military genius". On his trip to the Chinese embassy after Mao's death, Benn recorded in an earlier volume of his diaries that he was [...] "a great admirer of Mao", while also admitting that [...] "he made mistakes, because everybody does".|$|E

[...] He added, [...] "I don't crave fame. It's kind of goofy. I didn't {{want to be a}} public <b>figure.</b> <b>I</b> wanted to be an actor, not a movie star. But I love rock 'n' roll-there, I'd rather be a rock star. That would be cool." [...] He said that [...] "like all soap actors," [...] he sticks with the script the majority of the time, [...] "but every now and then he goes off the page," [...] commenting, [...] "You get to direct yourself. You come up with a little bit. It's improvisational. Maybe you're doing it just for your castmates, but the audience catches on." ...|$|E
500|$|LeMond has {{acknowledged}} since 2010 that the increasing prevalence of doping in cycling {{contributed to his}} lack of competitiveness. Said LeMond: [...] "Something had changed in cycling. The speeds were faster and riders that I had easily out performed were now dropping me. At the time, the team I was on, Team Z, {{became more and more}} demanding, more and more concerned..." [...] He stated he had been told in 1994 that he would need to blood dope in order to win again. LeMond did not focus solely on doping for his difficulties. He frankly admitted to Abt in 1999: [...] "I <b>figure</b> <b>I</b> had three months that went right for me after the hunting accident," [...] three months in which he won the two Tours and a world road race championship. [...] "The rest were just pure suffering, struggling, fatigue, always tired." ...|$|E

500|$|Chinga, the titular evil doll, {{was created}} by sewing {{together}} various doll parts. An oversized doll's head {{was placed on the}} finished body and [...] "the world's largest wig" [...] adorned its head. Props master Ken Hawryliw later reported that the hairpiece was actually the result of several wigs being sewn together. Most of the makeup effects were created by artist Toby Lindala, who [...] "appreciate the chance to create these classics for a Stephen King project". The [...] "Death Under Glass" [...] scene featuring Dave the Butcher with a knife in his eyes was created in post-production via a computer. Special effects supervisor Laurie Kellsen-George tested the scene on her nine- and eleven-year-old sons, explaining that [...] "I gauge a lot of the show by whether my kids can stand them or not. If they can't, I <b>figure</b> <b>I</b> succeeded [...] 'Chinga' bothered them a lot." [...] Reportedly, during the self-mutilation scene in the supermarket, a real customer who had wandered onto the set saw the commotion and left in a panic.|$|E
500|$|Welles {{considered}} Falstaff to be [...] "Shakespeare's greatest creation" [...] {{and said}} that the role was [...] "the most difficult part I've ever played." [...] Keith Baxter believed that making the film was Welles's life's ambition. Before the 1939 Boston premiere of Five Kings, Welles told journalists [...] "I will play him as a tragic <b>figure.</b> <b>I</b> hope, of course, he will be funny to the audience, just as he was funny to those around him. But his humor and wit were aroused merely {{by the fact that he}} wanted to please the prince. Falstaff, however, had the potential of greatness in him." [...] Reviews for the 1939 play mention Welles' choice to downplay the traditional comedic elements of Falstaff in his performance. This reverence for the character increased over the years and by the time Welles made Chimes at Midnight, his focus was entirely on the relationships between Falstaff, Hal and Henry IV. He believed that the core of the story was [...] "the betrayal of friendship." [...] Welles called Hal's rejection of Falstaff [...] "one of the greatest scenes ever written, so the movie is really a preparation for it. Everything prepares for it." [...] Throughout the film, Hal constantly turns his back on Falstaff, foreshadowing the film's ending.|$|E
500|$|In April 1969, Clancy {{got married}} and went on a honeymoon trip around the world, swimming, surfing and [...] "getting some sun." [...] He said, however, {{marriage}} had not reduced his desire to play football. [...] "Just the opposite", he said. [...] "I'm more hungry than ever. [...] I {{want to make that}} money." [...] After a season on crutches, the UPI reported: [...] "The former rookie wonder wants to get back under quarterback Bob Griese's passes, to reclaim his billing as the Miami Dolphins' top receiver. [...] Despite a scar on his knee, Clancy was dashing, cutting and jumping for passes during summer workouts. [...] However, even Clancy acknowledged the injury had slowed him down: [...] "I'm still a couple of steps slower than before the operation. [...] But I'm optimistic. [...] It doesn't pain me. [...] I <b>figure</b> <b>I</b> have a month to work the way I want to, I'll be all right." [...] Clancy's comeback appeared to be on track in early November, as he was a close second among Miami receivers with 21 catches for 289 yards. [...] However, the comeback was cut short on November 2, 1969, when he suffered torn ligaments, this time to his right knee in a loss to the New York Jets. [...] Clancy missed the final six games of the 1969 season due to the injury.|$|E

[...] Cochems explained in words and photographs (of Robinson) how the forward pass could be thrown and how passing skills could be developed. [...] "he necessary brevity {{of this article}} will not permit of a detailed discussion of the forward pass," [...] Cochems lamented.

2500|$|When Dreyfus' {{ideas were}} first {{introduced}} in the mid-1960s, they were met with ridicule and outright hostility. By the 1980s, however, many of his perspectives were rediscovered by researchers working in robotics and the new field of connectionism—approaches now called [...] "sub-symbolic" [...] because they eschew early AI research's emphasis on high level symbols. In the 21st century, statistics-based approaches to machine learning simulate {{the way that the}} brain uses unconscious instincts to perceive, notice anomalies and make quick judgements. These techniques are highly successful and are currently widely used in both industry and academia. [...] Historian and AI researcher Daniel Crevier writes: [...] "time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of Dreyfus's comments." [...] Dreyfus said in 2007, [...] "I <b>figure</b> <b>I</b> won and it's over—they've given up." ...|$|E
2500|$|Capp also lampooned popular {{recording}} idols of the day, such as Elvis Presley ("Hawg McCall," [...] 1957), Liberace ("Loverboynik," [...] 1956), the Beatles ("the Beasties," [...] 1964)—and in 1944, Frank Sinatra. [...] "Sinatra was {{the first}} great public <b>figure</b> <b>I</b> ever wrote about," [...] Capp once said. [...] "I called him 'Hal Fascinatra.' I remember my news syndicate was so worried about what his reaction might be, {{and we were all}} surprised when he telephoned and told me how thrilled he was with it. He always {{made it a point to}} send me champagne whenever he happened to see me in a restaurant..." [...] (from Frank Sinatra, My Father by Nancy Sinatra, 1985). On the other hand, Liberace was [...] "cut to the quick" [...] over Loverboynik, according to Capp, and even threatened legal action—as would Joan Baez later, over [...] "Joanie Phoanie" [...] in 1967.|$|E

2500|$|Before the 2008 presidential {{election}}, Trudeau {{sent out}} strips {{to run in}} the days after the election in which Barack Obama was portrayed as the winner. Newspapers were also provided with old strips as an alternative. When asked whether he created the original strip with complete confidence in an Obama victory, Trudeau replied: [...] "'Nope, more like rational risk assessment. Nate Silver at Fivethirtyeight.com is now giving McCain a 3.7% chance of winning – pretty comfortable odds. Here's the way I look at it: If Obama wins, I'm in the flow and commenting on a phenomenon. If he loses, it'll be a massive upset, and the goofy misprediction of a comic strip will be pretty much lost in the uproar. I <b>figure</b> <b>I</b> can survive a little egg on my face'." [...] In response, McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said, [...] "We hope the strip proves to be as predictive as it is consistently lame." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{could be}} that it is {{extremely}} difficult to start life. It might be that it is so difficult to start life that it has happened only once among all the planets... Let us consider, just as a conjecture, that the chance life starting when we have got suitable physical conditions is 10−100. I don't have any logical reason for proposing this <b>figure,</b> <b>I</b> just want you to consider it as a possibility. Under those conditions ... it is almost certain that life would not have started. And I feel that under those conditions {{it will be necessary to}} assume the existence of a god to start off life. I would like, therefore, to set up this connexion between the existence of a god and the physical laws: if physical laws are such that to start off life involves an excessively small chance, so that it will not be reasonable to suppose that life would have started just by blind chance, then there must be a god, and such a god would probably be showing his influence in the quantum jumps which are taking place later on. On the other hand, if life can start very easily and does not need any divine influence, then I will say that there is no god.|$|E
2500|$|In 1924 the British and Irish governments {{agreed to}} attend the [...] "Boundary Commission" [...] to redraw the border which {{partitioned}} Ireland between the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland. The Free State's representative was Eoin MacNeill, a respected scholar and Minister for Education. The Free State expected to gain much territory in heavily Catholic and republican parts of counties Londonderry, Fermanagh, Tyrone, and Armagh, as the British government had indicated during the treaty negotiations that {{the wishes of the}} nationalist inhabitants along the border would be taken into account. However, after months of secret negotiations a newspaper reported that there would be little change to the border and the Free State would actually lose territory in Donegal. MacNeill resigned from the commission and the government for not reporting to Cosgrave on the details of the commission. Cosgrave immediately went to London for a meeting with the British Prime Minister and the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, where they agreed to let the border remain as it was, and in return the Free State did not have to pay its pro-rata share of the Imperial debt. In the Dáil debate on 7 December Cosgrave stated: [...] "I had only one figure in my mind and that was a huge nought. That was the <b>figure</b> <b>I</b> strove to get, and I got it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Whedon always {{intended}} for the character to become an icon, claiming [...] "I {{wanted her to be}} a hero that existed in people's minds the way Wonder Woman or Spider-Man does, you know? I wanted her to be a doll or an action <b>figure.</b> <b>I</b> wanted Barbie with Kung Fu grip! I wanted her to enter the mass consciousness and the imaginations of growing kids because I think she's a cool character, and that was always the plan. I wanted Buffy to be a cultural phenomenon, period." [...] In developing Buffy, Whedon was greatly inspired by Kitty Pryde, a character from the pages of the superhero comic X-Men. He admits, [...] "If there's a bigger influence on Buffy than Kitty, I don't know what it was... She was an adolescent girl finding out she has great power and dealing with it." [...] In a 2009 interview, Whedon revealed he only recently realised how much he saw of himself in Buffy. After years of relating more to Xander, he says, [...] "Buffy was always the person that I was in that story because I'm not in every way." [...] Whedon openly wonders why his identification figure is a woman, but describes it as [...] "a real autobiographical kind of therapy for me" [...] to be writing a strong female character like Buffy.|$|E
2500|$|Powell {{donated the}} maximum {{allowable}} amount to John McCain's {{campaign in the}} summer of 2007 and in early 2008, his name was listed as a possible running mate for Republican nominee McCain's bid during the 2008 U.S. presidential election. However, on October 19, 2008, Powell announced his endorsement of Barack Obama during a Meet the Press interview, citing [...] "his ability to inspire, because of the inclusive nature of his campaign, because he is reaching out all across America, because of who he is and his rhetorical abilities", in addition to his [...] "style and substance." [...] He additionally referred to Obama as a [...] "transformational figure". Powell further questioned McCain's judgment in appointing Sarah Palin as the vice presidential candidate, stating that {{despite the fact that she}} is admired, [...] "now that we have had a chance to watch her for some seven weeks, I don't believe she's ready to be president of the United States, which is the job of the vice president." [...] He said that Obama's choice for vice-president, Joe Biden, was ready to be president. He also added that he was [...] "troubled" [...] by the [...] "false intimations that Obama was Muslim." [...] Powell stated that [...] " [...] is a Christian—he's always been a Christian... But the really right answer is, what if he is? Is there something wrong with being a Muslim in this country? The answer's no, that's not America." [...] Powell then mentioned Kareem Rashad Sultan Khan, a Muslim American soldier in the U.S. Army who served and died in the Iraq War. He later stated, [...] "Over the last seven weeks, the approach of the Republican Party has become narrower and narrower [...] I look at these kind of approaches to the campaign, and they trouble me." [...] Powell concluded his Sunday morning talk show comments, [...] "It isn't easy for me to disappoint Sen. McCain in the way that I have this morning, and I regret that [...] I think we need a transformational <b>figure.</b> <b>I</b> think we need a president who is a generational change and that's why I'm supporting Barack Obama, not out of any lack of respect or admiration for Sen. John McCain." [...] Later in a December 12, 2008, CNN interview with Fareed Zakaria, Powell reiterated his belief that during the last few months of the campaign, Palin pushed the Republican party further to the right and had a polarizing impact on it.|$|E
