5|$|The emperor Julian himself {{published}} {{a memoir of}} his campaigns on the Rhine, now lost. <b>His</b> <b>Letter</b> <b>to</b> the Athenians, an attempt to justify his rebellion against his cousin and senior emperor Constantius II, contains some details of the Rhine campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Hixon was {{the first}} to {{describe}} the use of electromagnetic principles to measure articulation. In <b>his</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> the editor, published in The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, he described a setup using two sensor coils and one generator coil. The sensor coils, attached to the forehead and back of the neck, would remain stationary while the generator coil, attached to the jaw, would move creating variable currents in the sensor coils. These currents could then be used to determine the distance in two dimensions.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the tally}} of Cardinal Charles de Lorraine-Guise in <b>his</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> Henry II, once the twelve {{participating}} French cardinals reached Rome, twenty-three cardinals were aligned in the French faction, twenty-two in the Imperial faction, and four neutral; thus Guise judged {{it impossible for}} either faction to garner the necessary two-thirds simply by persuading neutral cardinals. In addition, eleven Italian cardinals whom Guise counted among the French faction were only likely {{to vote for a}} fellow Italian, making the three favorites of Henry IILouis de Bourbon de Vendôme, Jean de Lorraine, and Georges d'Amboiseunfeasible. The non-French cardinal protector of France, d'Este, would then have been the choice of Henry II; Catherine de' Medici preferred her cousin Giovanni Salviati, who was extremely unacceptable to the Imperial faction and the Farnese.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the writers}} who {{fell victim to}} the regime of Sejanus and its aftermath, were the historians Aulus Cremutius Cordus and Velleius Paterculus and the poet Phaedrus. Cordus was brought to trial in AD 25 by Sejanus, under accusations of treason. He was charged for having eulogized Marcus Junius Brutus and spoken of Gaius Cassius Longinus {{as the last of}} the true Romans, which was {{considered}} an offence under the Lex Maiestatis; the Senate ordered the burning of his writings. His fall is elaborated upon by Seneca the Younger, in <b>his</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> Cordus' daughter Marcia To Marcia, On Consolation. Seneca tells us that her father most likely incurred Sejanus' displeasure for criticising him because he had commissioned a statue of himself. We also know from this source that Cordus starved himself to death. Marcia was instrumental in saving her father's work so that it could be published again under Caligula.|$|E
5|$|At {{four days}} to Zero Hour, the alien plant has grown to cover {{many areas of the}} base. After SG-1 go missing on their off-world mission, a Goa'uld named Ba'al {{contacts}} Stargate Command and suggests an exchange of the captured SG-1 against Camulus, another Goa'uld who requested asylum on Earth several episodes before. With the help of Camulus, a potent power source is found and brought back to Stargate Command, only to find it tainted by Camulus (powering it up could result in the destruction of the Solar system). With the SGC suffering from a temporary electricity failure caused by the alien plants, Ba'al's renewed contacting only results in O'Neill's mocking. Exhausted by sleep deprivation two days to Zero Hour, O'Neill finishes <b>his</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> General Hammond to inform him of his resignation.|$|E
5|$|The Presbyterian {{majority}} {{was quickly}} {{demonstrated by the}} election of their candidate the Duke of Hamilton as President of the Convention. On 12th March, James landed in Ireland and on 16th March, <b>his</b> <b>Letter</b> <b>to</b> the Convention was read out, demanding obedience and threatening punishment {{for those who did}} not comply. Public anger at the Letter's uncompromising tone meant some Episcopalians stopped attending the Convention, claiming to fear for their safety while others changed sides. Tensions were high, with Edinburgh Castle held by the Duke of Gordon, Dundee recruiting Highland levies for James and fears of an Irish invasion. These factors exaggerated the Presbyterian majority in the Convention which now met behind closed doors guarded by its own troops.|$|E
