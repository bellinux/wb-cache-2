A scattered-light scanner particle sizing instrument previously developed at NASA Lewis Research Center was further developed and used to determine characteristic drop diameters for the cryogenic sprays. In the breakup regime of aerodynamic-stripping, i. e., sonic-velocity conditions, the following correlation of the reciprocal Sauter mean diameter, D(sub 32) exp - 1, with the atomizing-gas flowrate, W(g), was obtained: D(sub 32) exp - 1 = k(sub c) (W(g) exp 1. 33), where k(sub c) is a proportionality constant evaluated for each atomizing gas. Values of k(sub c) = 120, 220, and 1100 were obtained for argon, nitrogen, and helium <b>gasflows,</b> respectively.

Our study results indicate that themean free path of all molecules in nanopores depend on both the radius of the nanoporeand the gas-solid interaction strength.

Three monitored spectral lines of calcium were used to observe changes in ground and excited level populations of atoms and ions, in ion excitation temperatures using the two-line method. Observations were made at a fixed height, namely 25 mm above the rf coil and varying carrier <b>gasflows</b> from 2 to 51 min- 1 and were correlated with the position of the "initial radiation zone" (IRZ) in the plasma. Ionization interferences occurring only inside the IRZ indicate an excitation mechanism depleting ion ground level population and populating excited atom and ion levels. No changes in atom absorbances or excitation temperatures were observed ruling out ionization suppression as dominating mechanism. Indications are that increased collisional excitation for Ca ions and ambipolar diffusion may be the dominant excitation mechanism operating in the analyte channel. Recombination reactions (three body or radiative) or charge transfer reactions may be responsible for an increase of excited atom level populations. It is obvious that non-thermal processes are operating under conditions favourable for ionization interferences occurring in the ICP. © 1985. Articl...|$|R

50|$|Overhead cam engines {{were first}} {{developed}} as high performance aircraft and racing engines, with the camshafts mounted {{directly over the}} valves and driving them through a simple bucket tappet. To give the best valve position for <b>gasflow</b> through a crossflow cylinder head, valves were usually mounted in two rows and with two separate camshafts. These bucket tappets were usually adjusted by a small shim, either above or below the tappet. Shims were made {{in a range of}} standard thicknesses and a mechanic would swap them to change the tappet gap. The engine would first be assembled with a default shim of known thickness, then the gap measured. A set of different shims would then be installed, each one chosen according to the change needed from the measured gap to the ideal gap. The gaps would then be measured again, in case of mistakes and also in case the cam position had shifted slightly. As the camshaft had to be removed to change the shims, this was an extremely time consuming operation, especially as the precise height of the camshaft above the cylinder head could change, depending on how carefully it was re-installed.|$|E
40|$|The thesis "Structure and {{dynamics}} of the solar chromosphere" of J. M. Krijger is {{a study on the}} behavior of the solar chromosphere, the thin layer just above the solar surface (photosphere) visible in purple red light during a total solar eclipse. The most important result of this thesis is that the chromosphere is filled with acoustic and internal gravity waves that travel upward until they collide with a canopy of expanding magnetic field. The photosphere is the layer of which we see the light with the naked eye. Through this layer poke large and small magnetic tubes. Above the photosphere and the chromosphere sits the hot solar corona of a few million degrees. With observations of among others the space satellite TRACE (Transition Region and Coronal Explorer) J. M. Krijger shows that the photosphere is dominated by flows of the ambient gas that dictate the magnetic field where to go. The possible heating of the chromosphere is an important unsolved problem in solar physics. The chromosphere forms the transition region between the very hot corona, dominated by magnetic fields, and the photosphere where <b>gasflows</b> drag the magnetic field along. In this transition region the magnetic field, which in the photosphere is still trapped in individual tubes, expands to a canopy above which the magnetic field fills the entire space. In this thesis it is shown that the chromosphere is dominated by upward propagating acoustic waves and a magnetic canopy that changes the {{dynamics of the}} oscillations. Finally J. M.

40|$|Abridged) High-resolution spectroscopic {{monitoring}} of RW Aur A {{was carried out}} in 1996, 1998 and 1999 with simultaneous B, V photometry. A multicomponent spectrum is revealed with a veiled photospheric spectrum, broad emissions, narrow emission lines of helium, and accretion, wind and shell features. Periodic modulations in many spectral features were found. The photospheric absorption lines show sinusoidal variations in radial velocity with an amplitude of +- 6 km/s and a period of about 2. 77 days. The radial velocities of the narrow emission lines of He vary with the same period but in anti-phase to the photospheric lines. The equivalent widths of the narrow emissions vary with a phase-shift with respect to the velocity curve. The strength of the red-shifted accretion components of Na D and other lines is also modulated with the same period. The broad emission lines of metals vary mostly with the double period of about 5. 5 days. One unexpected result is that no correlation was found between the veiling and the brightness, although both varied in wide ranges. This is partly due to a contribution of the shell absorption to the photospheric line profiles, which make them vary in width and depth thus simulating lower veiling. Most of the observed features can be interpreted in the framework of non-axisymmetric magnetospheric accretion. We consider two possible models. In the first the asymmetry is induced by orbital motion of an invisible, low mass secondary, which also influences the <b>gasflows</b> around the star, the second considers rotational modulation of a single star with an inclined or asymmetric magnetosphere.

50|$|The lowest drum of {{the three}} {{provided}} the heating surface. This was almost entirely filled with a cylindrical corrugated furnace. A length, approximately one diameter, {{was filled with a}} number of, around 60, small diameter fire-tubes. Compared to previous large-flued stationary boilers, such as the Lancashire or Galloway boilers, this was a larger heating area in a very compact space. The tubes were still short, compared to locomotive boilers, and offered good <b>gasflow</b> for the exhaust gases without needing additional exhaust draughting. The waterspace around the furnace was just thick enough to allow good circulation and leave space for mud to build up, but otherwise keeping the water volume to a minimum. This led to rapid heating of the water and so good thermosyphon circulation into the central drum above. This circulation was encouraged by the provision of a number of pipe connections between the drums. Each connection had an internal divider to give two separated pipes, the downcomer being just a short pipe from {{the lower part of the}} drum, but the outlet of the upwell pipe was raised above the water level and turned over in an outlet nozzle, promoting mixing of the hottest water and avoiding the formation of a stratified hot layer above cold. Examples showed a single large diameter fire-tube at the base of the tubeplate and a full-diameter section of furnace beyond the fire-tube nest, but the purpose of either of these features is unclear. Like the larger Lancashire boilers, exhaust gases were then led through brick flues around the outside of the boiler.|$|E

40|$|Hydrogen {{combustion}} {{may represent}} a threat to containment integrity in a VVER- 440 / 213 plant owing to the combination of high pressure and high temperature. A study {{has been carried out}} using the <b>GASFLOW</b> 2. 1 three-dimensional CFD code to evaluate the hydrogen distribution in the containment during a beyond design basis accident. The VVER- 440 / 213 containment input model consists of two 3 D blocks connected via one-dimensional (1 D) ducts. One 3 D block contains the reactor building and the accident localization tower with the suppression pools. Another 3 D block models the air traps. 1 D ducts represent the check valves connecting the accident localization tower with the air traps. The VVER pressure suppression system, called ''bubbler condenser,'' was modeled as a distributed heat sink with water thermodynamic properties. This model accounts for the energy balance. However, it is not currently possible to model dynamic phenomena associated with the water pools (e. g., vent clearing, level change). The <b>GASFLOW</b> 2. 1 calculation gave detailed results for the spatial distribution of thermal-hydraulic parameters and gas concentrations. The range and trend of the parameters are reasonable and valuable. There are particularly interesting circulation patterns around the steam generators, in the bubbler tower and other primary system compartments. In case of the bubbler tower, concentration and temperature contour plots show an inhomogeneous distribution along the height and width, changing during the accident. Hydrogen concentrations also vary within primary system compartments displaying lower as well as higher (up to 13 - 20 % and higher) values in some nodes. Prediction of such concentration distributions was not previously possible with lumped parameter codes. <b>GASFLOW</b> 2. 1 calculations were compared with CONTAIN 1. 2 (lumped parameter code) results.

What is the influence of the airbag cover on the occupant response for OOP situations and how to accurately model the airbag cover? Are current dummy models suitable to assess the localized human injuries and/or is it beneficial to include human models for injury assessment? The combined multibody-FE code MADYMO was used. A virtual set-up of a folded driver airbag including cover, steering wheel and a simple seat forms the base model. Occupants were positioned according to the two OOP driver positions defined in FMVSS 208, i. e. chin on module to maximize neck injury risk and chest on module to maximize chest injury risk. The 5 th percentile Hybrid III. dummy model as well as the 5 th percentile human model were used and different airbag inflation and cover modeling techniques were investigated. Attention was focussed on analyses of the injury values obtained from the simulations of the different situations (with / without cover, use of <b>gasflow,</b> human / dummy model). From this study, it is concluded {{that it is important to}} take into account the geometrical effects of the airbag cover on airbag deployment and hence injury generation in OOP simulations. Adding a <b>gasflow</b> description to the airbag deployment simulation resulted in differences in the early deployment phase. If the dummy's injuries are determined in this phase (dependent of scenario), <b>gasflow</b> contributes to improved airbag modeling at the cost of higher CPU times.

Under sonic gas-velocity conditions, liquid-jet breakup occurred in the regime of aerodynamic stripping. As a result, the following correlation of volume-median drop diameter, D(sub v. 5), with atomizing gas flowrate, W(sub g), was derived for two-fluid atomizers: (D(sub v. 5)) (exp - 1) = k(sub c) (W(sub g)) (sup n), where proportionally constant k(sub c) and exponent n are functions of droplet vaporization rate. Partially vaporized sprays were investigated and it was found that n = 1. 11, which is considerably less than the value of 1. 33 that is predicted by atomization theory.

Because of the ongoing steam condensation occurring in the suppression pool, the pressure there remains permanently at a lower level {{compared to the other}} components, resulting in a continuous flow of steam and noncondensable gases into this volume. Since no steam condensation is modeled in the drain tank, almost all H_ 2 and N_ 2 accumulate in the suppression pool cover gas volume. After 10, 500 s of steam flow, also air starts entering the vacuum vessel, with the basic mechanisms remaining the same. Consequently, an accumulation of N_ 2 and O_ 2 takes place in the suppression pool cover gas. Combustible and explosive H_ 2 -O_ 2 -N_ 2 mixtures exist after 13, 600 s, and at 21, 000 s a stoichiometric H_ 2 /O_ 2 ratio has formed, involving 14 kg of hydrogen. Contrary to the situation in the suppression pool with its significant hydrogen risk, only inert, steam dominated mixtures without hazard potential develop in the vacuum vessel and the drain tank. Various passive mitigation measures could be considered to reduce or completely remove the hydrogen risk in the suppression pool. (orig.)

40|$|A three {{dimensional}} computation {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) code, <b>GASFLOW,</b> {{is applied to}} analyze the hydrogen risk for Qinshan-II nuclear power plant (NPP). In this paper, the effect of spray modes on hydrogen risk in the containment during a large break {{loss of coolant accident}} (LBLOCA) is analyzed by selecting three different spray strategies, that is, without spray, with direct spray and with both direct and recirculation spray. A strong effect of spray modes on hydrogen distribution is observed. However, the efficiency of the passive auto-catalytic recombiners (PAR) is not substantially affected by spray modes. The hydrogen risk is significantly increased by the direct spray, while the recirculation spray has minor effect on it. In order to simulate more precisely the processes involved in the PAR operation, a new PAR model is developed using CFD approach. The validation shows that the results obtained by the model agree well with the experimental results...|$|E
