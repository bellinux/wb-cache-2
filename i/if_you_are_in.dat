He says that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> Lhasa airport and someone is fiddling with your luggage, yelling [...] "fuck off" [...] will effectively communicate that they should stop and leave. Morissette says, [...] "The f-word is special. Everybody uses the word 'breakfast', but not everyone feels comfortable using the word 'fuck' so there's an extra power behind it." [...] Boone argues for less use of the word, saying that he uses his surname instead. Radio talk show host Dennis Prager {{says that it is}} acceptable for youths to hear the word on television and film, but not from their family members. In the film, opponents of the word [...] "fuck" [...] use an argument commonly known as [...] "Think of the children".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} on The John and Ken Show on KFI, Headley {{was asked if he}} experienced retaliation from Scientology for speaking critically about the organization. He said that he had been issued a declaration that he was to be considered a [...] "Suppressive Person" [...] by members of the organization, and explained, [...] "That's basically the thing that goes out to anyone and everyone who is in Scientology, saying, 'This person is a Suppressive Person, and you can no longer speak to him ever again.' <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> Scientology, and you speak to somebody who is a Suppressive Person, you yourself can be declared a Suppressive Person." [...] Headley said when he left Scientology the organization gave him a [...] "freeloader statement", a bill for US$62,000, for courses he had received in Scientology. [...] "It's actually illegal, because they are basically charging me for on-the-job training – in California you can't charge somebody for on-the-job training. It's of no real value, but you don't know that, when you're in Scientology. You think, 'Are they going to garnish my wages, are they going to sue me?' You don't know," [...] said Headley.|$|E

500|$|... "It's Not Up to You" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "dizzying ballad" [...] and a song that lifts the album upward. Michael Paoletta of Billboard described the track as [...] "melancholy". Its lyrics are about [...] "love for the unknown devices that culminate in 'perfect days'", and [...] "pleas to find beauty in unlikely places". The [...] "caressing lyrics" [...] of [...] "Undo" [...] assure that: [...] "It's not meant to be a strife/It's not meant to be a struggle uphill". Biographer Mark Pytlik writes, [...] "Undo" [...] is a held hand, a reassuring reminder that anything can happen once you let it. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> pain, undo it, Björk suggests, no hint of disingenuousness in her voice, over climbing strings and a rising choir". [...] "Pagan Poetry" [...] is a [...] "harp-splashed" [...] song that concerns unrequited love. The track builds slowly, [...] "with Björk wailing over swelling keyboard crescendos," [...] until, at the four-minute mark, [...] "all the music drops away, leaving Björk utterly exposed" [...] as she sings [...] "I love him, I love him/I love him, I love him/I love him, I love him". The song also features [...] "a flotilla of music boxes with an Asian-teahouse touch." [...] The instrumental interlude [...] "Frosti" [...] {{has been described}} as a [...] "metallic tundra". Its sound stems from a music box, creating an intimate, fairy tale-like effect.|$|E
2500|$|Socialist Studies {{accuses the}} SPGB of coming under the {{influence}} of anarchist ideas and not sufficiently emphasising the parliamentary aspect of the socialist revolution. [...] Socialist Studies claims that the SPGB's position is that the state would be abolished immediately upon the overthrow of class society, whereas Socialist Studies's position is that the state would [...] "gradually wither away" [...] instead. Referring to the SPGB's 1984 Conference resolution (since rescinded) that [...] "Socialism will entail the immediate abolition of and not the gradual decline of the State", Socialist Studies writes, <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> favour of the immediate abolition of the State when Socialism is established then you are in favour of its immediate abolition here and now, which is of course the anarchist position… Unless Socialists use the power of the machinery of government to dispossess the capitalist class they will be unable to establish Socialism. [...] We find it inconceivable that intelligent Socialists of a future generation would even consider such an act of monumental stupidity.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his text}} Buddho Ajahn Thate {{describes}} {{what it is}} like when the mind has finally rid itself of preoccupation with sensual distractions and is able to focus on the breath, mantra, or a part of the body, in meditation: [...] "When you first enter concentration, this is what it's like: [...] You'll have no idea at all of what concentration or one-pointedness of mind is going to feel like. You are simply intent on keeping mindfulness firmly focused on one object – and the power of a mind focused firmly on one object is what will bring you to a state of concentration. You won't be thinking at all that concentration will be like this or like that, or that {{you want it to be}} like this or like that. It will simply take its own way, automatically. No one can force it. At that moment you will feel as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> another world (the world of the mind), with a sense of ease and solitude to which nothing else in the world can compare. When the mind withdraws from concentration, you will regret that that mood has passed, and you will remember it clearly. All that we say about concentration comes from the mind which has withdrawn from that state. As long as it is still gathered in that state, we aren't interested in what anyone else says or does. You have to train the mind to enter this sort of concentration often, so as to become skilled and adept, but don't try to remember your past states of concentration, and don't let yourself want your concentration to be like it was before – because it won't be that way, and you will just be making more trouble for yourself." ...|$|E
