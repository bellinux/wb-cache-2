Instead, in 1898 the Lighthouse Board approved the construction a new 184-foot cast iron skeleton tower equipped with a first order lens named the Cape Fear Lighthouse, to be located on the southeastern end of Bald Head Island, where it could mark the shoals. The Cape Fear Light served as a coastal beacon from 1903 to 1958. After the construction of the Cape Fear Lighthouse, Old Baldy continued to serve as an active lighthouse with a fourth-order <b>fixed</b> <b>beacon</b> until 1935 and housed a radio beacon until 1958.

We investigate the behavior of the closed-loop dynamics for a two agent mutual pursuit system in which each agent employs the beacon-referenced CB pursuit law with regards to the other agent and a stationary beacon. Under certain assumptions on the associated control parameters, we demonstrate that this problem admits circling equilibria wherein the agents move on circular orbits with a common radius, in planes perpendicular to a common axis passing through the beacon. As the common radius and distances from the beacon are determined by choice of parameters in the feedback law, this approach provides a means to engineer desired formations in a three-dimensional setting...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} tracking multiple moving robots using noisy sensing of inter-robot and interbeacon distances. Sensing is local: there are three <b>fixed</b> <b>beacons</b> at known locations, so distance and position estimates propagate across multiple robots. We show that the technique of Nonparametric Belief Propagation (NBP), a graph-based generalization of particle filtering, can address this problem and model multi-modal and ring-shaped uncertainty distributions. NBP provides the basis for distributed algorithms in which messages are exchanged between local neighbors. Generalizing previous approaches to localization in static sensor networks, we improve efficiency and accuracy by using a dynamics model for temporal tracking. We compare the NBP dynamic tracking algorithm with SMCL+R, a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm [1]. Whereas NBP currently requires more computation, it converges in more cases and provides estimates that are 3 to 4 times more accurate. NBP also facilitates probabilistic models of sensor accuracy and network connectivity. ...|$|R

30|$|The RO {{comparisons}} among GPSR, CAR, CAIR, and JBR {{are depicted}} in Figure  16. It is worth noted that CAR shows a decreasing RO with VD increasing, {{whereas the other}} three protocols' RO grows {{with the rise of}} VD, which will bring more collisions on MAC. Due to the use of an adaptive beaconing mechanism, where low traffic density scenarios generate beacons more frequently than in high traffic density ones, the RO under higher VD is even smaller than that under lower VD in CAR. Among the other three protocols, JBR uses the most control overhead in view of its destination flooding mechanism to provide query results for packet source. Our CAIR's RO is in between GPSR and JBR which is consistent with the result of Figure  12. Actually, since more control overheads are needed to compute the connectivity and estimate the experienced delay when more routing paths are available, CAIR eventually shows a rising RO even though its connectivity-based route selection could tolerate some interference from physical layer thus correspondingly reducing the number of collisions and retransmissions. As for GPSR, which employs <b>fixed</b> <b>beacon</b> interval and sends beacons pro-actively (modulo data traffic with piggybacked position information), its RO also experienced a rise with the growth of VD. The reason behind is that more collisions and retransmissions on MAC cause routing layer to use more beacons to remain up-to-date about the position information of neighborhoods.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} robots to {{estimate}} their location {{is crucial for}} a wide variety of autonomous operations. In settings where GPS is unavailable, measurements of transmissions from <b>fixed</b> <b>beacons</b> provide an effective means of estimating a robot's location as it navigates. The accuracy of such a beacon-based localization system depends both on how beacons are distributed in the environment, and how the robot's location is inferred based on noisy and potentially ambiguous measurements. We propose an approach for making these design decisions automatically and without expert supervision, by explicitly searching for the placement and inference strategies that, together, are optimal for a given environment. Since this search is computationally expensive, our approach encodes beacon placement as a differential neural layer that interfaces with a neural network for inference. This formulation allows us to employ standard techniques for training neural networks to carry out the joint optimization. We evaluate this approach on a variety of environments and settings, and find that it is able to discover designs that enable high localization accuracy.

The results show that when the measurements arrive synchronously, both the filters exhibit good performance if the initial estimation errors are small.
