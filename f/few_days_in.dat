The Jury aims to order the problems so that the order in increasing difficulty is Q1, Q4, Q2, Q5, Q3 and Q6.

5|$|The {{atmosphere}} is a chaotic system. As a result, small changes to {{one part of}} the system can accumulate and magnify to cause large effects on the system as a whole. This atmospheric instability makes weather forecasting less predictable than tides or eclipses. Although it is difficult to accurately predict weather more than a <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>in</b> advance, weather forecasters are continually working to extend this limit through meteorological research and refining current methodologies in weather prediction. However, it is theoretically impossible to make useful day-to-day predictions more than about two weeks ahead, imposing an upper limit to potential for improved prediction skill.|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment is antibiotics. Phenazopyridine is occasionally prescribed {{during the first}} <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>in</b> addition to antibiotics {{to help with the}} burning and urgency sometimes felt during a bladder infection. However, it is not routinely recommended due to safety concerns with its use, specifically an elevated risk of methemoglobinemia (higher than normal level of methemoglobin in the blood). Acetaminophen (paracetamol) may be used for fevers. There is no good evidence for the use of cranberry products for treating current infections.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} individual {{training at}} Ingleburn, the battalion moved on foot to Bathurst to complete collective training. Following this, the 2/17th embarked for the Middle East from Sydney on 20 October 1940, {{on board the}} Queen Mary. Moving in convoy the Queen Mary briefly stopped in Fremantle, before continuing to Bombay in early November where the battalion was disembarked. Following a <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>in</b> camp ashore they were transferred to the Rohna for the next leg of the voyage. The convoy continued, sailing via the African coast into the Gulf of Aden and then through the Suez Canal, before finally berthing at El Kantara in Egypt. The battalion {{was assigned to the}} 20th Brigade, along with the 2/13th and 2/15th Battalions, which were initially allocated to the 7th Division; however, following its arrival in the Middle East in November 1940, the battalion was transferred {{along with the rest of}} the brigade to the 9th Division.|$|E

There were also 24 types of spider, and the five ant species included the nationally rare Myrmica specioides. The rare millipede Thalassisobates littoralis, a specialist of coastal shingle habitats, was found here in 1972, and a red-veined darter appeared in 2012. Tens of thousands of migrant turnip sawflies were recorded for a <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>in</b> late summer 2006, along with red-eyed damselflies. The silver Y moth also appears in large numbers in some years.|$|E
5|$|However, {{interviews}} with the two of the voice actors have given a glimpse into small parts of the development process.

His journey to eastern Siberia took 11 weeks, for much of which he was accompanied by his mother and sisters. Deemed only a minor threat to the government, he was exiled to a peasant's hut in Shushenskoye, Minusinsky District, where he was kept under police surveillance; he was nevertheless able to correspond with other revolutionaries, many of whom visited him, and permitted to go on trips to swim in the Yenisei River and to hunt duck and snipe.|$|E
5|$|Leopard Trek {{came to the}} Tour de France with, per season-long expectations, a squad {{centered}} around overall victory.

Brother Fränk said his goal was to have Andy win the Tour, with Fränk himself also there on the podium with him. The remaining squad members were Cancellara, Gerdemann, Monfort, Fuglsang, Voigt, O'Grady, and Posthuma. Every rider on the squad had ridden the Tour de France before, and all but Monfort, Fuglsang, and Posthuma had previously worn the yellow jersey.

The planes of the 8th Fighter Wing, which were attempting to defend Suwon to allow evacuation of UN civilians encountered repeated harassing attacks from North Korean aircraft operating out of Heijo Airfield in Pyongyang. Heijo was the KPAF's main base, but in the first <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>in</b> the war the US aircraft only had authorization to defend themselves if attacked, they could not conduct offensive operations into North Korea.|$|E
