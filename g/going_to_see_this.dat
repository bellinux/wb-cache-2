2500|$|Bawer commented {{frequently}} {{on the treatment}} of gays in the films and TV. In a March 10, 1996, Times article, Bawer argued that while new films from Britain, the Netherlands, France, and Germany provided fresh, human treatments of gay people, most Hollywood movies about gays continued to be timid, banal, and formulaic. [...] On April 14, 1996, Bawer said on the CBS Evening News, apropos of the new movie “The Birdcage,” that “A good farce has one foot in reality. A gay person <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> movie realizes this movie doesn't have a single foot in reality.” A writer for The Guardian cited Bawer's complaint about the makers of “The Birdcage”: “They don't get gay life. They don't get anything, outside of a narrow Hollywood idea of gay life. These characters have no dignity, nor pride.” Bawer was a major subject of Angela D. Dillard's 2001 book Guess Who's Coming to Dinner Now? Multicultural Conservatism in America. Reviewing it for Salon, he {{described it as a}} book written from “the heart of Academic Country, where the very existence of conservatives who are not straight white males can indeed generate horror and confusion (or, alternatively, amusement, perhaps bordering on clinical hysteria), and where, as surely as a multiplicity of genders, skin colors, ethnic backgrounds and sexual orientations is the collective dream, a multiplicity of viewpoints is the collective nightmare.” He chided Dillard's account of “gay conservative” as ill-informed and criticized her for, among other things, including him on “a list of people who have 'sided with the Religious Right'—even though I wrote 'Stealing Jesus' (1997), which indicts fundamentalism as a betrayal of Christianity.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "So you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> {{young man}} again!" [...] This came from Mrs Baggett, {{who had been}} in great {{perturbation}} all the morning. The Sergeant had slept in the stables through the night, and had had his breakfast brought to him, warm, by his own wife; but he had sat up among the straw, and had winked at her, and had asked her to give him threepence of gin with the cat-lap. To this she had acceded, thinking probably that she could not altogether deprive him of the food to which he was accustomed without injury. Then, {{under the influence of the}} gin and the promise of a ticket to Portsmouth, which she undertook to get for him at the station, he was induced to go down with her, and was absolutely despatched. Her own box was still locked up, and she had slept with one of the two maids. All this had not happened without great disturbance in the household. She herself was very angry with her master because of the box; she was very angry with Mary, because Mary was, she thought, averse to her old lover; she was very angry with Mr Gordon, because she well understood that Mr Gordon was anxious to disturb the arrangement which had been made for the family. She was very angry with her husband, not because he was generally a drunken old reprobate, but because he had especially disgraced her on the present occasion by the noise which he had made in the road. No doubt she had been treated unfairly in the matter of the box, and could have succeeded in getting the law of her master. But she could not turn against her master in that way. She could give him a bit of her own mind, and that she did very freely; but she could not bring herself to break the lock of his door. And then, as things went now, she did think it well that she should remain a few days longer at Croker's Hall. The occasion of her master's marriage was to be the cause of her going away. She could not endure not to be foremost among all the women at Croker's Hall. But it was intolerable to her feelings that any one should interfere with her master; and she thought that, if need were, she could assist him by her tongue. Therefore she was disposed to remain yet a few days in her old place, and had come, after she had got the ticket for her husband,--which had been done before Mr Whittlestaff's breakfast,--to inform her master of her determination. [...] "Don't be a fool," [...] Mr Whittlestaff had said.|$|E
