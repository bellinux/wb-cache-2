5|$|The final large {{reception}} {{room on the}} first floor is the Hondecoeter Room (16), so named because of the three huge oil paintings by Melchior d'Hondecoeter (1636–1695), depicting scenes of birds in courtyards, which are fitted into the neo-Carolean panelling. The panelling was introduced to the room by the 3rd Earl Brownlow in 1876, when it was furnished as the principal <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mansion. The room was initially created as a library in 1808 from {{the upper part of the}} earlier kitchen which had originally risen two stories. The West staircase (14) was originally a service stairs, and would have been plainer in decor, but by the late nineteenth century it was in regular use by the family.|$|E
5|$|Alliance {{with his}} father-in-law, Władysław I the Elbow-high, King of Poland, became a {{permanent}} element of Charles's {{foreign policy in}} the 1320s. After being defeated by the united forces of the Teutonic Knights and John of Bohemia, WładysławI sent his son and heir, Casimir, to Visegrád in late 1329 to seek assistance from Charles. During his stay in Charles's court, the nineteen-year-old Casimir seduced Claire Záh, who was a lady-in-waiting of Charles's wife, Elisabeth of Poland, according to an Italian writer. On 17April 1330, the young lady's father, Felician Záh, stormed into the <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> royal palace at Visegrád with a sword in his hand and attacked the royal family. Záh wounded both Charles and the queen on their right hand and attempted to kill their two sons, Louis and Andrew, before the royal guards killed him. Charles's revenge was brutal: with the exception of Claire, Felician Záh's children were tortured to death; Claire's lips and all eight fingers were cut before she was dragged by a horse through the streets of many towns; all of Felician's other relatives within the third degree of kinship (including his sons-in-law and sisters) were executed, and those within the seventh degree were condemned to perpetual serfdom.|$|E

In order not to raise suspicion, the two assailants returned separately back to their room through the staircase instead of the elevator.|$|E

25|$|At 7:00pm, the Government {{held its}} last {{meeting in the}} Malachite Room, with the {{telephone}} and all {{contact with the outside}} world disconnected. A short debate determined that they would not leave the palace to attempt dialogue with the hostile crowds outside. With the palace completely surrounded and sealed, the Aurora began her bombardment of the great Neva façade as the Government refused an ultimatum to surrender. Further machine gun and light artillery fire were directed at the palace as the Bolsheviks gained entry via His Majesty's own Staircase (36). In the ensuing battle there were casualties on both sides until the Bolsheviks finally, by 2:00am, had control of the palace. Leaving a trail of destruction, they searched room after room before arresting the Provisional Government in the Small <b>Dining</b> <b>Room</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> private apartment (28), from where they were taken to imprisonment in the Fortress across the river.

5000|$|In Neoclassical furniture, {{it was a}} {{large wooden}} vase-like {{container}} which was usually set on a pedestal on either side of a side table.

The urn and the vase were often set on the central pedestal in a [...] "broken" [...] or [...] "swan's" [...] neck pediment.

500|$|After White won {{his third}} Michelin star in 1995, {{he found a}} new obsession. While 54 {{restaurants}} across Europe had three stars at the time, there was a further rating system used by Michelin called the knives and forks.

White wanted his restaurant to be the undisputed best restaurant in the UK, since La Tante Claire, the Waterside Inn and Le Gavroche had each only gained four. With these in mind, White moved the restaurant from the Hyde Park Hotel to the Le Méridien Piccadilly Hotel, closing at the initial location on 16 August 1997. White took the [...] listed Oak Room as the main <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> restaurant, opening there two weeks later.

500|$|Sammy Cox (aka Samuel Emanuel Jervis) (c1773–1891) is a {{significant}} former resident. He {{claimed to have been}} born Samuel Emanuel Jervis in England and spent time on his uncle's ship after his father died, then jumped ship in 1789 near Tamar heads and subsequently lived with the local aboriginals for twenty-six years. This would have him resident in Tasmania years before the first recorded settlement, in 1803 on the Derwent River, and before even the existence of Bass Strait was proved by George Bass and Matthew Flinders. In 1814 he met and was befriended by the Cox family, residents near Hadspen, and took the family's surname. He ended up working as a gardener and spent about 50 years living in a cottage on the [...] "Little Moat" [...] property on the Launceston side of Carrick. Cox died in the Launceston insane asylum in 1891 claiming to be 117 years old, though 115 is a more credible figure (von Stieglitz in 1946 credited his age as 118). His story has been widely reported; the <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Carrick Hotel is named after him on the basis of it. It has been called into doubt, though, with historian Dr Andrew Piper describing the story as a tall tale constructed by Cox.
