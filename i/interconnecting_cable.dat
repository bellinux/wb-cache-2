40|$|Future high {{performance}} digital computing systems will demand extremely high throughput and connection-intensive backplanes. Free-space optical interconnects {{have the potential}} to meet these demands. This thesis explores the application of a two-dimensional array of metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) photodetectors in a free-space photonic backplane. In particular, two-dimensional smart pixels are presented as a means of achieving a large communications space-bandwidth product. It is argued that a system based on such devices can overcome several physical limitations experienced by electrical interconnects of current printed circuit board based electronic backplanes. As a means to this end, a review of MSM photodetector technology is then conducted. The layout and design of the optical receiver is presented. The effects of misalignments, optical power variations, and device non-uniformity on receiver performance are considered. With these design parameters in mind, the construction of a receiver assembly is described from the first step of packaging the photodetector array to the last <b>interconnecting</b> <b>cable</b> connection. Specific packaging challenges that are discussed include power dissipation, connectivity, and electrical isolation as related to receiver performance. The method and results of characterization are presented in relation to its meeting the requirements of a receiver array in a free-space optical backplane. Future areas for improvement are then considered...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{studies as}} well as {{simulations}} have been performed on the Back-to-Back starting schemes low frequency-, partial frequency-, and soft -start-up. A Back-to-Back configuration of two synchronous machines {{has been established in}} the laboratory, upon which parameter estimation and start-up experiments have been performed. Extensive parameter estimation was conducted in order to replicate the laboratory machines in the simulation model as accurately as possible. This was done in order to verify the validity of the simulation model. Studies into the effects of inductance interconnecting the machines were made in the laboratory and in the simulation model. Effects of resistance and inertia were studied in the simulation model. It is concluded that the simulation model appears to be as reliable as is its input parameters. Discrepancies were found in line voltages, due to faulty implementation of field current replication. Full scale simulations using Motorformer parameters were performed in the simulation model, featuring low frequency- and soft -staring. The effects of an <b>interconnecting</b> <b>cable</b> were studied. It is concluded that low frequency starting appears to be most reliable and least violent starting method. However, it might be limited by the availability of a turbine. This is not the case for soft starting, which has a lower starting capability and is more violent to the motor damper- and field windings. Low frequency startig is the recommended starting method of the ones studied. Dynamic short circuit simulations were done on a fixed speed LNG-facility. The fixed speed alternative appears to be more stable when responding to a short circuit. This is because the motors contribute to upholding the voltage during a fault by delivering reactive power to the short circuit, and because the motors do not loose all torque as is the case for LCI drives when the voltage dip exceeds 20 $%$. Further work is needed in up-scaling the experiments. A sophisticated simulation model should be established and its validity tested on the up-scaled experiments. Preliminary custom design of machines should be initiated depending on what starting scheme is chosen. Custom machine parameters should then be used in full scale simulation using the more sophisticated model. </p...|$|E
