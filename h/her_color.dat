Twilight is surprised to find these to be the friendship report letters that she had previously sent to Celestia, and the memories of her friendships in Ponyville make her regain <b>her</b> <b>color.</b> Inspired by this, she returns to her other four best friends and uses a memory spell to remind them of their friendship, cancelling Discord's magic and returning them to normal.|$|E
500|$|In {{spite of}} {{shortcomings}} in her characterization {{during the late}} 1960s, [...] "by the early 1970s, Batgirl had matured, using her keen intellect, athletic dexterity, and burgeoning detective skills to solve petty and not-so-petty thefts". <b>Her</b> <b>color</b> scheme from the [...] Adventures of Batman cartoon are used as her primary outfit. However, {{by the end of}} the Bronze Age of Comic Books in the mid-1980s (and with the dark, gritty influence of Frank Miller's work on the Batman-related titles), Batgirl became less valuable to the franchise [...] "where there was not as much room for a librarian fighting crime in high heels". In this environment, Barbara Gordon becomes increasingly skeptical of her effectiveness as Batgirl until she decides to give up crime-fighting permanently.|$|E
500|$|While the Applewhites are {{regarded}} as the first major black characters on the series, Cherry stated {{that the role of}} Betty was originally offered to two white film actresses, both of whom turned it down due to financial and time commitment issues. He clarified: [...] "There's nothing strategically black about her character. <b>Her</b> <b>color</b> is incidental." [...] Woodard had never seen the show before accepting the role. Desperate Housewives producers sent her fifteen episodes of the show, which she divided amongst various family members. After they compared storylines, Woodard recalled that she became [...] "instantly hooked" [...] on the series. Woodard reported experiencing heavy media attention after accepting the role. Both Brooks and his brother, Billy, auditioned for the role of Matthew. The final decision came down to both brothers as well as two other actors. According to Cherry, Brooks was cast because he exuded a [...] "dangerous" [...] element, as well as [...] "a combination of this wholesome, sweet quality and a dark, brooding quality." ...|$|E

500|$|Her parents, nicknamed 'Ernie' and 'Ducky,' {{were first}} cousins who {{married at the}} {{instigation}} of their common grandmother, Queen Victoria. The marriage was an unhappy one from the start. Princess Victoria Melita was eighteen {{at the time of}} Elisabeth's birth. She was fond of Elisabeth, but found it hard to compete with Ernst's devotion to their daughter. Ernst was convinced even before Elisabeth could speak that he alone could understand her. At the age of six months, she was scheduled to move to a new nursery and her father 'consulted' her on <b>her</b> <b>color</b> preferences. He claimed that she made 'happy little squeals' when he showed her a particular shade of lilac material. Ernst then decorated her nursery in shades of lilac. He later had a playhouse built for his daughter that stood in its own garden. Adults were forbidden to enter [...] "much to the frustration of royal nurses and tutors, who could be seen pacing up and down impatiently outside as they waited for their high-spirited young charges to stop their games and emerge." ...|$|E
500|$|Mansfield adopted pink as <b>her</b> <b>color</b> in 1954 and was {{associated}} with pink {{for the rest of}} her career. Her original choice was purple, but she thought it too close to lavender, Kim Novak's signature color. [...] "It must have been the right decision," [...] she said, [...] "because I got more column space from pink than Kim Novak ever did from lavender." [...] For her wedding to Hargitay she wore a tight-fitting gown of pink lace with a flounce of 30 yards of pink tulle (designed by a 20th Century-Fox costume designer), and at the reception she had Hargitay drink pink champagne. In November 1957 (shortly before their marriage), Mansfield bought the 40-room Mediterranean-style mansion (formerly owned by Rudy Vallée) at 10100 Sunset Boulevard in Beverly Hills. Much of the money to buy the house came from her inheritance from Elmer Palmer, her maternal grandfather. Mansfield had the house painted pink, with cupids surrounded by pink fluorescent lights, pink fur in the bathrooms, a pink heart-shaped bathtub and a fountain spurting pink champagne; she then dubbed it the [...] "Pink Palace". Hargitay (a plumber and carpenter before taking up bodybuilding) built the pink heart-shaped swimming pool. The year after reconstructing the [...] "Pink Palace" [...] as a [...] "pink landmark", she began riding a pink Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz convertible with tailfins, then the only pink Cadillac in Hollywood.|$|E
500|$|Zero was {{designed}} by Kimihiko Fujisaka, a designer who had worked on each entry in the Drakengard series. His original design was meant to emulate her status as a god-like being, and have a more elaborate and heroic appearance, but as the game's atmosphere was finalized, Fujisaka redesigned her with some unaesthetic elements, taking direct influence from the game atmosphere: this was the main reason behind adding her prosthetic arm. The original creation of the arm was a pure accident on Fujisaka's part. <b>Her</b> <b>color</b> palate {{was intended as a}} reverse of Caim, the protagonist of Drakengard. Other aspects of her design evoked the color and design for the Goddess of the Seal, a key character in the earlier Drakengard games. She went through two redesigns before Yoko was satisfied. Her final design, along with the flower in her eye, emphasized her sexuality. She originally had no flower in her design, but Fujisaka wanted to add an aspect of femininity to her appearance. The decision to place it in her eye was to add originality to the character: while the game's producer Takamata Shiba originally feared it {{was too much of a}} risk in conjunction with her gender, Yoko approved of the design. After Zero was finalized, Yoko decided on more female characters, and told Fujisaka to [...] "think Puella Magi Madoka Magica" [...] while designing them. Elements of her design were incorporated into the other Intoners. Her design, along with the rest of the main characters, was inspired by modern clothing styles and fashion in contrast to the [...] "medieval" [...] inspiration of previous games.|$|E

2500|$|The Idiot is a perfect, and {{her most}} famous, example of this. <b>Her</b> <b>color</b> palette is {{extremely}} vivid and striking. Malfatti makes great use of primary colors, and she outlines her subject in black which clearly defines {{the shape of}} the chair and the woman, but which leaves the background indiscernible as to exactly what it is representing. The brush-strokes are large and imperfect as well and do not lend a solid feeling of spatial organization to the painting. Instead, the woman and the background seem to exist on the same plane, only being separated by color movement and shapes. The subject of a woman seated on a chair is nothing remarkable in the art world, but the subject title of the piece as well as the striking upward glance of the woman's eyes explains how it would be shocking to a conservative Brazilian culture. Not only is Malfatti painting an (as it would seem) underbelly representation of society, but she is doing so at a time when society was searching for a [...] "Brazilian" [...] style. All of a sudden it becomes uncertain what Malfatti is representing of Brazil.|$|E
2500|$|The season saw the {{promotion}} of Alfre Woodard and Mehcad Brooks to series regulars, [...] after they were introduced {{in the final two}} episodes of the first season. Woodard played Betty Applewhite, a [...] "deeply religious, overbearing single mother" [...] while Mehcad portrayed her son, Matthew. In regards to the characters and their mystery storyline, Cherry stated: [...] "They come on the street; they seem like nice people — but they've got a secret. And it's pretty gothic. It's real and human and awful all at the same time." [...] Woodard commented that her character [...] "never means harm... Let's just say she has flaws. She had to make some really tough decisions quick and if the law ever catches up with her, she'll have to serve time... But they'll never catch her." [...] The final scene in which Betty and Matthew bring food to the prisoner in their basement was originally intended for the first-season finale but saved for [...] "Next" [...] instead. While the Applewhites are regarded as the first major black characters on the series, Cherry stated that the role of Betty was originally offered to two white film actresses, both of whom turned it down due to financial and time commitment issues. He clarified: [...] "There's nothing strategically black about her character. <b>Her</b> <b>color</b> is incidental." [...] Woodard stated that she had never seen the show before accepting the role, something that led the producers to send her fifteen episodes of the show, which she divided amongst various family members.
