40|$|Abstract — Waterworks {{fittings}} {{and accessories}} are important applications for ductile irons. Although, {{in the design of}} these components the graphite nodularity is a critical attribute for material selection, the International Standard ISO 2531 does not include the minimum required value of graphite nodularity and its definite effect on mechanical properties. In this research the effect of graphite nodularity on tensile strength, elongation, impact strength and wear rate was studies. Different samples from four heats of cast iron containing several of graphite nodularities were cast. Different degrees of graphite nodularities from low graphite nodularity of about 21 % up to high graphite nodularity of 94 % were produced by treatment cast iron by different amount of spheroidizing (Mg) and antispheroidizing (Ti) elements. It is concluded that all properties relating to strength and ductility decrease as the graphite nodularity increase, and those properties relating to failure, such as tensile strength and impact strength are more affected by changing of graphite nodularity. The minimum graphite nodularity of 60 % can be considered for design as satisfactory values of <b>ductile</b> <b>iron</b> <b>fittings</b> and accessories for all DN values.
