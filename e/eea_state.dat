5000|$|Case E-26/13 Gunnarsson {{concerned}} two Icelandic nationals {{residing in}} Denmark. Mr Gunnarsson {{and his wife}} were in Denmark from 24 January 2004 to 3 September 2009. During this period, their total income consisted of his wife’s unemployment benefit (that she was in receipt of in Iceland up until 1 May 2004) and his disability pension from the Icelandic Social Insurance Administration, together with benefit payments he received from two Icelandic pension funds. He paid income tax in Iceland on his income but was precluded from including, for tax purposes, his wife’s personal tax credit while they were Danish residents. This was because under the applicable Icelandic tax provisions, they had to reside in Iceland in order to pool their personal tax credits. Mr Gunnarsson brought an action against the Icelandic State, seeking repayment of the alleged overcharge. The Court to held that Article 1(1) of Directive 90/365 and Article 7(1)(b) of Directive 2004/38 must be interpreted such that they confer on a pensioner who receives a pension due to a former employment relationship, but who has not carried out any economic activity in another <b>EEA</b> <b>State</b> during his working life, not only a right of residence in relation to the host <b>EEA</b> <b>State,</b> but also a right to move freely from the home <b>EEA</b> <b>State.</b> The latter right prohibits the home State from hindering such a person from moving to another <b>EEA</b> <b>State.</b> A less favourable treatment of persons exercising the right to move than those who remain resident amounts to such a hindrance. Furthermore, a spouse of such a pensioner has similar derived rights, cf. Article 1(2) of Directive 90/365 and Article 7(1)(d) of Directive 2004/38, respectively.|$|E
