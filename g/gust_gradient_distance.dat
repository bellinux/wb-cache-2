40|$|The results {{obtained}} from an evaluation for gust and draft velocities of acceleration and airspeed-altitude records taken by NACA recording instruments installed in P- 61 c airplanes participating in thunderstorm flights 6, 7, and 8 of July 9, 1946, July 10, 1946, and July 11, 1946, respectively, are presented herein. These data {{are summarized in}} tables I and II. In accordance with a recent discussion {{with a member of}} the U. S. Weather Bureau staff, the tabulated results for the present flight include in addition to data of the type presented in reference 1, the initial heading of the airplane for each traverse, the pressure altitude at the start of each traverse in increments of 500 feet, and the <b>gust</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>distance</b> when it could be evaluated. The cloud entry and exit times for the present data were taken from motion-picture records of the pilot's instrument panels whenever such records were available while the length fo the traverses in seconds and feet was taken from the airspeed-altitude records. In many cases, however, poor agreement is indicated between the duration of the cloud traverses as obtained from the motion-picture records and from the airspeed-altitude records. This result is believed to be due to camera stoppages, inaccurate spring mechanisms of the clocks, and loss of motion-picture record in exposure or development. With reference to the evaluation of gust data, the nominal threshold was about 2 feet per second. In making gust counts to this threshold, some gusts below that threshold have been included due to limitations of the procedure used. Thus, it will be noted that in some instances gust counts are given in table I although now corresponding gust velocities are listed...|$|E

Data were also obtained on wind velocities and temperatures as functions of altitude for use in attempting to correlate the gust-structure data with various meteorological quantities. The results indicated little or no correlation between the gust velocity and the <b>gradient</b> <b>distance.</b> The data, however, did indicate that an airplane the size of the Aeronca will respond most frequently to <b>gusts</b> having <b>gradient</b> <b>distance</b> of the order of 30 feet.

Additional calculations were made for the DC- 6 airplane to show the effects of speed and altitude. On the basis of the method of calculation used and the conditions selected for analysis, it is indicated that: 1) The newer airplanes show appreciably greater dynamic stress in gusts then does the reference airplane; 2) Increasing the forward speed or the operating altitude results in an increase of the dynamic stress ratio for the <b>gust</b> with a <b>gradient</b> <b>distance</b> of 10 chords...|$|R
40|$|A gust-tunnel {{investigation}} {{to determine the}} effects o enter-of-gravity position on the gust loads of a delta-wing model with the leading edge swept back 60 Â° was made over a range of center-of-gravity positions from 4 percent ahead of to 11 percent behind {{the leading edge of the}} mean geometric chord. This investigation indicated that a I-percent rearward movement of the center-of-gravity position increased the acceleration increment in the sharp-edge gust by 0. 5 percent. In a gust with a gradi-ent distance of 6. 5 chords, the acceleration increment was increased by approximately 2 percent f o r the same movement of the center of gravity. - Comparison of these results with those for a conventional airplane model indicates that the change in load for both configurations would be nearly the same in a sharp-edge gust, but in a <b>gust</b> with a <b>gradient</b> <b>distance</b> of 6. 5 chords, the change in load for a given change in center-of-gravity position would be approximately twice as great for the delta-wfng model as for the conventional airplane model...|$|R

For three gust shapes, a series of flights was made with the airplane model equipped with either a torsionally flexible or a rigid wing. The results indicated that the torsionally flexible wing reduced the maximum acceleration increment 5 percent for the sharp-edge gust and about 17 percent for <b>gust</b> shapes with <b>gradient</b> <b>distances</b> of 6. 8 and 15 chord lengths. The analysis indicated that the effectiveness of this method of gust alleviation was independent of the gust velocity and that, for the same total load increment, the torsionally flexible wing would have 10 percent less bending-moment increment at the root section of the wing than a rigid wing in all but the sharpest gusts. The results also indicated that the torsionally flexible wing slightly increased the longitudinal stability of the airplane model in a gust...|$|R

We address this need with an empirical characterization of the discretization error of gradient on random unit disc graphs. This characterization has uncovered two troublesome phenomena: an unsurprising dependence of error on source shape and an unexpected transient that becomes a major source of error at high device densities. Despite these obstacles, we are able to produce a quantitative model of discretization error for planar sources at moderate densities, which we validate by using it to predict error of gradientbased algorithms for finding bisectors and communication channels. Refinement and extension of the gradient discretization error model thus offers the prospect of greatly improving the engineerability of self-organizing systems on spatial networks. ...|$|R

By smoothing each element of the structure tensor considering both the spatial and <b>gradient</b> <b>distances</b> of neighboring pixels, the nonlinear structure tensor for each pixel is constructed.

Then the multi-scale value is computed by summing of the tensor distances in each scale. So a new weight based on multi-scale structure tensor distance is set up and included in bilateral filter for cost aggregation. By constructing the multi-scale nonlinear structure tensor and adding the new corresponding weight in cost aggregation, more pixels similar with central pixel could be aggregated in a support window and the final disparity map could be more accurate.
