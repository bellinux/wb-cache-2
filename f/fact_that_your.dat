Step by step, gradually but surely, the English principle of the absolute legislative sovereignty of Parliament ... is being qualified ... The rule of law enforced by the courts is the ultimate controlling factor on which our constitution is based. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> Lordships have been willing to hear this appeal and to give judgment upon it is another indication that the courts have a part to play in defining the limits of Parliament's legislative sovereignty.|$|E
500|$|Chulip {{received}} mostly average critical scores {{upon its}} release in North America. The game currently holds a 57% on the aggregate websites GameRankings and Metacritic. The ambitious gameplay of Chulip {{has been almost}} universally criticized. Ray Barnholt of 1UP.com, Ryan Davis of GameSpot, Micah Seff of IGN, and Gus Mastrapa of X-Play all labeled the often-unclear progression presented to the player as [...] "frustrating" [...] and [...] "tedious", requiring an excessive amount of patience. Mastrapa summarized, [...] "Since the game is on 24-hour clock a missed opportunity means having {{to wait until the}} next day to take another crack. Add the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> inexperienced, young avatar can die from heartbreak, resulting in a 'game over' screen and the loss of unsaved progress and you've got a recipe for annoyance." [...] Barnholt, Davis, and Seff did positively credit Natsume for the inclusion of the mini-strategy guide. Despite faulting the [...] "indistinct objectives", Davis found gratification in successful kisses. [...] "The whole kissing thing is absolutely fantastic in concept," [...] Davis stated, [...] "And there's something unsettling about your character's encouraged promiscuity." [...] However, Game Informer writer Ben Reeves described the game {{as one of the most}} poorly designed games he has ever played due to its lack of in-game direction and frequency of game overs. In January 2008, Game Informer listed Chulip one of the worst games of 2007.|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, the Catholic Church {{directly}} {{intervened in}} government plans in Croatia to introduce sex education teaching in schools (including {{the topic of}} homosexuality). Several parishes distributed leaflets at local Mass asking: [...] "Parents, do you care about the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> child will have to learn that a homosexual act is as natural and valuable as a sexual act {{between a man and}} a woman?" [...] Subsequently the teaching was suspended by Constitutional Court on the grounds that parents had the right to freely decide about the education of their children.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the 1920s Chanler corresponded {{frequently}} {{with his old}} friend Ludwig von Höhnel, then living in retirement in Vienna, on the [...] "Jewish world conspiracy" [...] {{and the degree to}} which von Höhnel shared Chanler's antisemitic ideology, writing on March 22, 1923: [...] "You don't seem disturbed by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> town is overrun by Jews." [...] Chanler accepted as authentic the widely recognized forgery, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and he employed agents to compile dossiers on Jewish public figures in the US and other countries.|$|E

50|$|This type {{of pattern}} {{recognition}} {{can result in}} apophenia based on the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> since <b>your</b> brain is not looking for exact matches, it can pick up some characteristics of a match and assume it fits. This is more common with pareidolia than data collection.|$|R
5000|$|Eat the Rich: A Treatise on Economics is a 1998 book by P. J. O'Rourke which {{explains}} economics in a humorous way. Its chapters include Good Capitalism (United States), Bad Capitalism (Albania), Good socialism (Sweden), Bad socialism (Cuba), and an intermission on [...] "Economics 101", teaching <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> economics professor didn't tell you, including the [...] "ten less basic rules of economics". Subsequent chapters are on How {{to make everything}} out of nothing (Hong Kong), How to make nothing out of everything (Tanzania), How (or how not) to reform (maybe) an economy (if there is one) (Russia) and Eat the rich, the last an encomium to capitalism.|$|R

6000|$|... "No, no, Lady Brackenstall--it is no use. You {{may have}} heard of any little {{reputation}} which I possess. I will stake {{it all on the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> story is an absolute fabrication." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cruel! What have I done? Tell me what cruelty. Have I beat you? Have {{you been}} starved? Have I not asked and implored your assistance,--only to be refused? The <b>fact</b> is <b>that</b> <b>your</b> father {{and you have}} found out that I am not a rich man, {{and you want to}} be rid of me. Is that true or false?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{would not}} have a man marry a girl without making love to her. The <b>fact</b> is, mother, <b>that</b> <b>your</b> tastes and mine are not exactly the same; you like silent beauty, whereas I like talking beauty, and then--" ...|$|R

50|$|The {{title of}} the album {{was the focus of}} a joke on an episode of the sitcom Arrested Development that aired well over a decade after the CD's release.
