40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the process of finacialisation in South Africa. Financialisation is defined after Krippner (2005) and Arrighi (1994), as a pattern of {{accumulation}} in which profits accrue through financial markets and channels rather than through trade or commodity production in the real economy. We examine the financialisation of the South African economy from 1990 to 2012 —both before and after major financial market liberalizations. Five key features of the period emerge; first, a precipitous increase {{in the size of the}} net acquisition of financial assets (and the net <b>incurrence</b> <b>of</b> financial <b>liabilities)</b> on the balance sheets of all agents. Second the centrality of credit and foreign money capital in the financialisation process. Third a measureable relationship between levels of Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) market capitalisation and levels of portfolio capital inflows. Fourth, credit effects that overwhelm portfolio shift effects to a far greater extent than in the euro-zone area. Fifth, and last an unusually high degree of financial intermediation (when compared with the Euro zone area) that may be explained by the high degree of concentration in South Africa’s Monetary and Financial Institutions Sector (MFI’s).

Prudent long-term investment strategy and transfer taxation planning remain key considerations in achieving those goals. This paper focuses primarily on transfer taxation planning and presents a case inviting {{the reader to}} determine the efficacy of gifting family limited liability company (FLLC) membership interests under the annual gift tax exclusion. The scenario consists of a hypothetical, high-wealth, married couple who founded and co-manages a FLLC investing in marketable securities. The couple {{has embarked on a}} long-term strategy of gifting membership interests to their children and grandchildren at valuation discounts, which leverage the annual gift tax exclusion. The issues implicit in the case remain relevant to wealth transfer planning as long as the potential exists in the foreseeable future for the <b>incurrence</b> <b>of</b> large tax <b>liabilities</b> on these transfers. Realistically, chances for repeal or a significant reduction seem remote in light of the mounting current federal budget deficits. Thus, the need for prudent wealth transfer tax planning remains convincing unless and until this outlook changes significantly for the better...|$|R

40|$|Florida law is {{currently}} unclear {{on the issue}} of whether a professional may rely upon a limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clause in a professional services contract. Limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses are common in business contracts, especially in construction, a field that includes many professionals such as engineers and architects. While Florida has historically enforced limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses in professional services contracts, recent cases have cast doubt on whether the clauses are enforceable. If the Florida Supreme Court establishes that professionals cannot rely upon these clauses, it will be taking a position contrary to the majority of states, including New York, California, and Texas, all of which enforce limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses with varying degrees of restriction. This Note argues that Florida should not prohibit professionals from using limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses. These clauses do not violate public policy when, as already required by Florida law, the clauses are stated clearly, ensuring that both parties to the contract are aware of their existence. Permitting professionals to continue to rely upon limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses honors the contracting parties’ freedom of contract. Additionally, limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses provide an efficient method for parties to allocate risk...|$|R

Mobile nodes (MNs) are {{classified}} as either slow or fast; first, though, to implement a bandwidth-efficient handoff scheme, an MN should be registered in a microcell. The microcell is overlapped to handle an overflow session request, which is nested; in a macrocell, an overflow session request makes a request to return from the boundary of the new microcell. If idle session traffic is in a cell, it is requested by the target microcell. If the total systemic traffic load is not very large, the proposed scheme provides the best bandwidth efficiency and a more favorable quality of service (QoS) for an MN without the <b>incurrence</b> <b>of</b> a large systemic processing cost...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} how {{the absence of}} insurance in the past led to some special maritime liability law principles such as 'general average' (i. e., losses or expenses shared by all the parties to a maritime adventure) and the limitation <b>of</b> shipowners' <b>liability.</b> In the absence of insurance, these principles served the function of insurance mostly for shipowners. As commercial marine insurance is now widely available, these principles have lost their justification and may in fact interfere with the most important goal <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law i. e., deterrence from negligence. The thesis thus recommends their abolition. The thesis further argues that when insurance is easily available and affordable to the both parties to a liability claim, the main goal <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law should be deterrence as opposed to compensation. This is exactly {{the case with the}} maritime cargo liability claims where both cargo owners and shipowners are invariably insured. As a result, the sole focus <b>of</b> cargo <b>liability</b> law should be and, to a great extent, is deterrence. On the other hand, in the vessel-source oil pollution liability setting, pollution victims are not usually insured. Therefore, oil pollution liability law has to cater both for compensation and deterrence, the two traditional goals <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law. The final question the thesis addresses is whether the deterrent effect <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law is affected by the availability <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> insurance. Contrary the popular belief the thesis attempts to prove that the presence <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> insurance is not necessarily a hindrance but can be a complementary force towards the realization of deterrent goal <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law...|$|R
