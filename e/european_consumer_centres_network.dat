50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Consumer</b> <b>Centres</b> <b>Network</b> was {{established}} to provide consumers with clear information about their rights and to assist them to effectively solving a consumer issue; this improves consumers' confidence in the European Single Market and helps to enforce economic potential for growth.|$|E
50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Consumer</b> <b>Centres</b> <b>Network</b> was {{established}} in January 2005 by the European Commission and national governments. As {{a result of the}} enlargement of the European Union, the ECC-Net has expanded to include: Bulgaria and Romania in 2007, and Croatia in 2013. Today, there are 30 European Consumer Centres: 28 in the EU Member States, one in Norway, one in Iceland.The ECC-Net originated from two former existing consumer information and protection networks: The Network for the extra-judicial settlement of consumer disputes (EEJ-Net) and the Euroguichet Network.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} current legal {{framework}} of the communications market within the European Union and concludes that despite efforts to strengthen consumer protection within a B 2 C dispute context, {{there is still a}} gap between conferred rights and guarantees and the ability to effectively exercise them. The paper proposes the creation of a system, holistic in its approach, to bridge that gap and improve access to justice. The proposed orientation requires a reorganisation of roles and the active participation of all market stakeholders, including consumers. Though not technologically innovative, the mapped system’s intended contribution is its articulation with the market and its responsiveness to consumers. Being conducive to binding and enforceable decisions, this alternative dispute resolution (ADR) system aims at establishing structural and procedural safeguards that ward due process, impartiality and rule of law while benefiting from the swiftness and lessened formality of traditional ADR. Information and communications technology plays a key part in enhancing those benefits even further. Finally some considerations concerning an eventual harmonisation of ADR in a B 2 C European communications context and its benefits are made. Consequently a suggestion for a collaborative network between equivalent ADR Bodies on a national level and, for instance, BEREC or the <b>European</b> <b>Consumers</b> <b>Centres</b> <b>Network</b> is presented. ADR Bodies, such as the one proposed, and complaint-management agencies are concluded to be ever closer to a role of forefront of the justice system, carrying out an essential role in dispute prevention.

50|$|The EEJ-Net was {{established}} in 2001 to help consumers to solve cross-border disputes with traders providing defective goods and services, by guiding them to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms (ADR).The Euroguichets were founded in 1992 at the European Commission's initiative with the objective to inform consumers about the opportunities of the European Single Market and about their rights as consumers in Europe. Moreover, the Euroguichets helped consumers encountering problems with cross-border transactions. The Euroguichets also acted as interfaces between consumers and the European Commission. The <b>European</b> <b>Consumer</b> <b>Centres</b> <b>Network</b> took over the duties of both organisations: It helps consumers to solve cross-border disputes and informs them about their rights in Europe.|$|E
50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Consumer</b> <b>Centres</b> <b>Network</b> (ECC-Net) is an EU-wide network. There is a {{national}} contact point called European Consumer Centre (ECC) in all 28 EU Member States, in Iceland and Norway. ECCs provide consumers with information about the opportunities and risks of the European Single Market and also regarding cross-border consumer topics, such as travel, various services, and the purchase of goods and services. The ECC-Net is staffed by legal experts who assist consumers free of charge to solve any dispute that may arise with enterprises based in another EU country, Norway, or Iceland. The ECCs are co-financed by the European Commission and national governments aiming to protect consumer rights and ensure that every EU citizen may {{take full advantage of}} the European Single Market. Depending on the formal structure some ECCs are hosted by non-governmental organizations (NGOs), governmental bodies, or independent organizations.|$|E
40|$|The {{first part}} of this thesis {{introduces}} the institutions of the European Union which are responsible for consumer protection. Their powers are explained on the process of formation of the Directive on Consumer Rights. Institutional structure of the European Union is completed by the Court of Justice of the European Union and its activities regarding the preliminary ruling. The end of this part compares the chosen judgements of the Court and the Advocate General's opinion concerning consumer protection. The aim of the second part of this thesis is to explain the cooperation between both Czech authorities and authorities of other member states, as well their connection to institutional structure of the European Union. The process of cooperation is also focused on the <b>European</b> <b>Consumer</b> <b>Centres</b> <b>Network.</b> This part also deals with the investigation of consumer awareness of their rights and possibilities across the single internal market of the European Union...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Akpan is a {{traditional}} ready-to-drink fermented yoghurt-like cereal beverage consumed in {{urban and rural areas}} in Benin. With the aim of adapting the product to new local and export markets, this work maps African and <b>European</b> <b>consumer</b> preferences for different types of Akpan. RESULTS: A sensory profile of Akpan was created and consumer tests were conducted with 103 consumers of African origin and 74 <b>consumers</b> of <b>European</b> origin. <b>Consumer</b> acceptance was significantly correlated with fermented odour (r=− 0. 94) and milky taste (r = 0. 92 – 0. 97) attributes. Cluster analysis revealed different behaviour by African and <b>European</b> <b>consumers</b> with respect to acceptability of Akpan; <b>European</b> <b>consumers</b> did not like the sour taste and African consumers liked an intense sweet milky taste. CONCLUSION: This study provides information on how Akpan, and other fermented yoghurt-type cereal products, could be adapted to African and <b>European</b> <b>consumer</b> preferences...|$|R
