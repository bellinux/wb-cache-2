5000|$|... #Caption: A.C. 2-Litre 1947-1956. The four-door {{configuration}} and {{the wider}} 6.75 × 16 inch wheels identify this as a later example. The <b>flashing</b> <b>indicators</b> will have been retro-fitted.|$|R
5000|$|Radiator lowered 1½ inches {{allowing}} a lower bonnet line; restyled front mudguards with separate <b>flashing</b> <b>indicators</b> (formerly {{incorporated in the}} fog and spot lights); smaller over-riders on the bumpers front and rear.|$|R
50|$|In September 1956 {{the shape}} of the front {{mudguards}} was re-arranged with the side lamps and <b>flashing</b> <b>indicators</b> in different positions. A small chrome reflector on the headlamp rim allowed the driver to know the side lights were functioning.|$|R
50|$|Similarly in September 1956 {{the shape}} of the front {{mudguards}} was re-arranged with the side lamps and <b>flashing</b> <b>indicators</b> in different positions. A small chrome reflector on the headlamp rim allowed the driver to know the side lights were functioning. Overdrive was made an option.|$|R
5000|$|Subsequently the semaphore-style trafficators on the C-pillars were {{replaced}} with <b>flashing</b> <b>indicators</b> within the light cluster. The front lights were modified {{to conform to}} new standards and in 1957 parallel windscreen wipers were substituted for the original [...] "cross hands" [...] ones featured at launch.|$|R
50|$|The game {{features}} European truck {{models with}} working instruments such as <b>flashing</b> <b>indicators,</b> temperature and low fuel warning lights, wipers, and gauges. The trucks included are the Mercedes-Benz Actros (known as Majestic), the Renault Magnum (known as Runner), the Scania R-series (known as Swift) and the Volvo FH16 (known as Valiant).|$|R
50|$|The Ariel Leader was a British {{motorcycle}} {{produced by}} Ariel Motorcycles between 1958 and 1965. A radical design, the Leader was fully enclosed with an integral windscreen {{and was the}} first British motorcycle to have optional <b>flashing</b> <b>indicators.</b> Ariel could not compete against Japanese imports and the last Ariel Leader was produced when the company closed in 1965.|$|R
50|$|The Škoda 1201 was {{a family}} car {{produced}} by Czechoslovakian automaker AZNP at their plant in Mladá Boleslav. Saloon and estate versions were offered along with a panel van. The car was released in 1954 as a successor to the Škoda 1200. It inherited its predecessor's steel ponton format body. One difference was the fitting of <b>flashing</b> turn signal <b>indicators,</b> whereas the 1200 had incorporated semaphore style trafficators in its front wings: subsequent retro-fitting of <b>flashing</b> <b>indicators</b> to old 1200s has left this as an imperfect method for distinguishing between the two models, however.|$|R
5000|$|The line of {{the front}} {{mudguards}} [...] "which", said The Times, [...] "previously gave the car a somewhat blunt appearance" [...] was re-arranged with the side lamps and <b>flashing</b> <b>indicators</b> in different positions. A small chrome reflector on the headlamp rim allowed the driver to know the side lights were functioning. Overdrive was made an option. These amendments were announced 11 September 1956.|$|R
5000|$|Featured a {{persistent}} <b>flashing</b> green <b>indicator</b> {{to indicate that}} the device had a network connection.|$|R
50|$|As {{well as a}} full body, the {{standard}} Leader features included a headlight trimmer, an extendable lifting handle for easy centrestand use, and a permanent windscreen mounting. Factory listed options included: integrated-design hard-luggage 'panniers', the first <b>flashing</b> <b>indicators</b> on a British motorcycle, a dash-mounted parking light, windscreen top-extension (adjustable on the move), a rear rack and a clock aperture built into a 'dashboard' (closed-off by an Ariel badge when not fitted).|$|R
50|$|Detroit was by now favouring annual facelifts, and Vauxhall {{reflected}} that trend, announcing further facelifts in 1956 (wind-up windows, larger rear window, wider grille slats, separate amber rear <b>flashing</b> <b>indicator</b> lights replacing US-style red units {{incorporated into the}} brake/tail light lens, new instrument graphics) and 1957 (electric wipers, larger tail lights, new grille, new 'magic ribbon' AC speedo) {{in line with the}} Wyvern model. Technically, however, there were no further changes until the arrival of a completely new Velox in October 1957.|$|R
50|$|The Rover 90 {{shared with}} the Rover 60 and Rover 75 the October 1954 modifications: a bigger boot, wide rear window and <b>flashing</b> {{directions}} <b>indicators</b> all announced at the Paris Motor Show.|$|R
50|$|The player starts his/her {{career as}} an {{employee}} of a cargo transportation company, work hard {{to be able to}} buy his own truck and start his own business. It is possible to purchase garages and setup branch offices across the United Kingdom to accommodate own growing truck fleet. The player can upgrade trucks and keep them in top condition for maximum efficiency such as fuel, and condition of the truck. As the game is set in the United Kingdom, it features European truck designs exclusively and feature actual working instruments such as <b>flashing</b> <b>indicators,</b> temperature and low fuel warning lights, wipers, and gauges.|$|R
50|$|In 1955, the {{separate}} brake lights were discontinued and were combined {{into a new}} larger taillight housing. The traditional VW semaphore turn signals were replaced by conventional <b>flashing</b> directional <b>indicator</b> lamps for North America.|$|R
5000|$|... <b>flashing</b> orange {{direction}} <b>indicator</b> lights positioned at {{the front}} where there had been reflectors and in the redesigned rear light clusters replaced trafficators in the door pillars.|$|R
50|$|An {{ordering}} mix-up {{meant that}} (right hand drive) NZ versions - now imported assembled from Japan - received the North American Geo tail lamp cluster with red <b>flashing</b> direction <b>indicators</b> {{rather than the}} Suzuki style cluster with amber flasher sent to Australia. Luckily for GM NZ, NZ law still allowed amber or red so the red lenses remained for the entire MH series run. The equivalent Suzuki had the amber lenses.|$|R
50|$|Another {{new feature}} {{is that they}} are the first series of cars that will be {{manufactured}} with the <b>flashing</b> brake <b>indicators</b> on the far ends of each car. These are similar to what is used on the Rohr cars and the rehabilitated Bredas, and indicate when the train is {{in the final stages of}} stopping. Mechanically, the 6000 series cars features the same cast trucks as the CAF cars, and use the same propulsion systems and advanced cab signaling systems found in the Breda 2000/3000-series rehabilitation from Alstom.|$|R
50|$|In October 1959 the D4 (like the 403) became {{available}} with a diesel engine, {{which was a}} major innovation at the time. In 1960 the power from the petrol engine was increased to 55 hp and the van was redesignated D4B. 1960 also saw a rearrangement of the exterior lights with the fitting of <b>flashing</b> direction <b>indicators</b> front and back. Further changes during the final five years were minor in nature, {{one of the more}} noteworthy being a small reduction, in 1963, of the number of bars on the front grill.|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} dark NH 4 + and NO 3 − {{assimilation}} on photosynthetic light harvesting {{capability of the}} green alga Selenastrum minutum was monitored by chlorophyll a fluorescence analysis. When cells assimilated NH 4 +, they exhibited a large decline in the variable fluorescence/maximum fluorescence ratio, the fluorescence yield of photosystem II relative to that of photosystem I at 77 kelvin, and O 2 evolution rate. NH 4 + assimilation therefore poised the cells in a less efficient state for photosystem II. The analysis of complementary area of fluorescence induction curve and the pattern of fluorescence decay upon microsecond saturating <b>flash,</b> <b>indicators</b> of redox state of plastoquinone (PQ) pool and dark reoxidation of primary quinone electron acceptor (QA), respectively, revealed that the PQ pool became reduced during dark NH 4 + assimilation. NH 4 + assimilation also caused {{an increase in the}} NADPH/NADP+ ratio due to the NH 4 + induced increase in respiratory carbon oxidation. The change in cellular reductant is suggested to be responsible for the reduction of the PQ pool and provide a mechanism by which the metabolic demands of NH 4 + assimilation may alter the efficiency of photosynthetic light harvesting. NO 3 − assimilation did not cause a reduction in PQ and did not affect the efficiency of light harvesting. These results illustrate the role of cellular metabolism in the modulating photosynthetic processes...|$|R
5000|$|For 1961, {{significant}} technical advances {{occurred in}} the form of a new engine and transmission. The engine remained at 1200cc but the power increased to [...] primarily due to an increase in compression ratio to 7.1:1. The carburetor received an electric automatic choke and the transmission was now synchronized on all forward gears. The traditional semaphore turn signals were replaced by conventional <b>flashing</b> directional <b>indicators</b> worldwide. The standard model called the TYPE 111-112, continued to use the 36hp 1200 engine of the old architecture that dates back to Franz Reimspiess original design of 1937 all the way until the end of the 1965 model year. 1965 standard model in 1965 is called the [...] "A" [...] sedan.|$|R
2500|$|A {{deliberate}} attempt to introduce [...] "modern car lines", the Mark E introduced semi-monocoque construction, both {{to improve the}} resilience {{of the car and}} to allow full-height doors to be fitted on both sides. As announced, the prototype car was completely flat-sided and as with previous models used light alloy for all exterior panels. Beneath the skin, there were two main steel frames, one which made up the principle support for the floor, rear suspension and doors and a second which carried the steering assembly and engine. This second frame was described as [...] "semi-floating" [...] to allow the damping out of engine vibrations and to prevent fractures. Further strength was obtained by separating the bonnet from the front grill, allowing the grill frame to add rigidity {{to the front of the}} car. Track and overall width of the car were the same as the Mark D, but the wheelbase was extended by [...] Though not appreciated at the time, this fundamentally affected the car's stability and made it liable to overturn. Weather protection was more sophisticated, the hood now including a front section that could be rolled back as a sunroof while the detachable side screens incorporate sliding windows. The seat was still a single bench, but the backrest was now split, one third allowing for adjustment to suit driver comfort, whilst the remainder hinged forward to allow access to the boot. Lighting was improved with larger headlamps, <b>flashing</b> <b>indicators</b> and rear number plate light. The fuel tank was increased in size to , but the car retained the Villiers 9E/3 engine with three-speed gearbox. Deliveries of the new car were expected to begin in May 1957.|$|R
50|$|Right {{hand drive}} cars were {{manufactured}} in Canada for export to {{countries such as}} Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, etc., until 1969. They used {{a version of the}} 1965 Impala dash panel — without provision for a radio and installed in a dashboard moulding made of fibreglass, not metal — until 1969. Radios (centrally mounted) and heaters were locally sourced and wipers parked {{in the center of the}} windscreen. Australian models were assembled in Australia from kits, as this lessened tax on the cars. The Australian cars had locally sourced amber <b>flashing</b> rear <b>indicators</b> replacing the clear reversing lenses, as red flashers were banned there. For New Zealand assembly, the bodies were supplied from Canada already welded, painted and trimmed.|$|R

50|$|The assistive {{listening}} device usually uses a microphone to capture an audio source near to its origin and broadcast it wirelessly over an FM (Frequency Modulation) transmission, IR (Infra Red) transmission, IL (Induction Loop) transmission, or other transmission method. The {{person who is}} listening may use an FM/IR/IL Receiver to tune into the signal and listen at his/her preferred volume. There are also other consumer ALD such as alarm clocks with bed shakers, amplified stethoscopes, baby monitors and <b>flashing</b> door bell <b>indicators.</b>|$|R
5000|$|An E74 {{error is}} {{indicated}} when the lower-right quadrant {{of the ring}} <b>indicator</b> <b>flashes</b> red and displays an error message in multiple languages: [...] "System Error. Contact Xbox Customer Support", with the code E74 at the bottom. The error {{is caused by the}} Xbox 360's hardware scaler chip being damaged.As of April 14, 2009, the E74 error is now covered by the three-year extended warranty, and customers who previously paid Microsoft for out-of-warranty service to correct the E74 error received a refund.|$|R
5000|$|The car {{was again}} updated in 1956 when {{the engine was}} {{increased}} in capacity to [...] The two-piece split windscreen was replaced with a curved one-piece one and the rear window was enlarged. In 1961 the semaphore-style trafficators were replaced by the <b>flashing</b> direction <b>indicators,</b> these were US-style red at the rear (using the same bulb filament as the brake lamp) and white at the front (using a second brighter filament in the parking lamp bulb) which was legal in the UK and many export markets at the time (such as New Zealand). An upmarket car based on the Minor floorpan using the larger BMC B-Series engine was sold as the Riley One-Point-Five/Wolseley 1500 beginning in 1957: versions of this Wolseley/Riley variant were also produced by BMC Australia as the Morris Major and the Austin Lancer.|$|R
50|$|In some levels, Lolo {{can obtain}} certain powers to help him. These powers include the Hammer, the Bridge, and the Arrow Turn (sometimes called a One-Way Pass). To obtain a power, Lolo must collect {{a certain amount}} of hearts, which is pre-defined in the data for any level that gives a power. This value varies from level to level. The maximum amount of powers a level can have is three. If the next heart to be {{collected}} will give Lolo a power, all hearts in the room will <b>flash</b> as an <b>indicator.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Interference {{is known}} as 'pulsating brakes' which may occur when braking while also having the turn <b>indicator</b> <b>flashing.</b> There are {{different}} ways to minimize this problem, and it ranges from using a special pulse preventer to having a separate electric brake trailer connector with a brake circuit completely separated {{from the rest of}} the trailer wiring. Be aware that if you do a completely separate wiring the brake ground must be separated from the lighting ground. That includes the breakaway protection circuits and battery. (Think of what Kirchhoff's circuit laws says).|$|R
5000|$|The Rover 60 was {{announced}} 24 September 1953 {{to add a}} more economical four-cylinder engine to Rover's range though leaving trim and equipment {{the same as the}} 75 and the new Rover 90 announced at the same time. Rover's idiosyncratic central gear change lever designed to allow three-abreast seating in front was used for this new car. [...] Its 2.0 L (1997 cc/121 in³) [...] engine had been used in the early Land Rover though it now had modifications including an SU carburettor. As the block was shorter than that of the 6-cylinder engine, it sat further back in the frame, and this is sometimes held to have resulted in better handling and compensated for the lack of power. The Rover 60 shared with the Rover 75 and Rover 90 the October 1954 modifications: a bigger boot, wide rear window and <b>flashing</b> directions <b>indicators</b> all announced at the Paris Motor Show. Independently adjustable separate front seats were made available at extra cost from September 1955.|$|R
2500|$|... 4-door {{sedan and}} station wagon Rebels from CKD (Completely Knocked Down) kits were {{assembled}} by Australian Motor Industries (AMI) in Port Melbourne, Victoria. Australian models {{were made with}} a RHD version of the 1967 Rambler Ambassador dash and two-dial instrument pack rather than the North American dash and rectangular speedo. The dash and cluster were reused for all subsequent models, including the Matador. The cars were built with right-hand drive and the body had the engine, transmission, front suspension, rear axle, and doors installed in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Other parts were boxed and shipped inside the car for final assembly in Australia. Australian models had to have aftermarket amber rear indicator lights fitted in the boot (trunk) lid to 1969 and amber lenses fitted behind the clear reverse lenses on 1970 models, as <b>flashing</b> red <b>indicators</b> were barred in Australia. Also in Australia, numerous other parts and components such as brakes, seats, carpet, lights, heaters, etc. were sourced locally to gain tariff concessions. As AMI also assembled Toyota vehicles, some parts used on the AMI Rebels were sourced from Toyota.|$|R
50|$|The report, dated February 1988, {{also showed}} that halfway through the flight from Pucallpa to Lima, the crew noted a {{possible}} malfunction of the landing gear. A cockpit indicator showed that the gear had not lowered, but CORPAC officials at Lima checked with observers on the ground, who informed the pilot that he could land safely. Villar then ordered Morales to check the emergency gear lowering procedure in the manual; the relevant page was written in English, which First Lieutenant Morales was not fluent in; he mistakenly instructed the pilot to follow step 1.3.1.7, which would <b>flash</b> a red <b>indicator</b> light, rather than step 1.4.3, which would display an orange light.|$|R
25|$|Since 2009 {{there have}} been {{widespread}} concerns from Chinese consumers particularly among the online community, who expressed that Volkswagen has {{failed to respond to}} complaints about defects in its DSG-equipped vehicles. Typical issues associated with 6-speed DSG include abnormal noise and inability to change gear; while issues associated with 7-speed DSG include abnormal noise, excessive shift shock, abnormal increase in engine RPM, <b>flashing</b> gear <b>indicator</b> on the dashboard as well as inability to shift to even-numbered gears. In March 2012 China’s quality watchdog the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) said that it had been in contact with Volkswagen (China) and urged the carmaker to probe the issues. In a survey held by Gasgoo.com (China) of 2,937 industry experts and insiders, 83% of respondents believed that the carmaker should consider a full vehicle recall. In March 2012 Volkswagen Group China admitted that there could be an issue in its seven-speed DSG gearboxes that may affect approximately 500,000 vehicles from its various subsidiaries in China. A software upgrade has since been offered for the affected vehicles in an attempt to repair the problem.|$|R
5000|$|The car was {{launched}} as a two- or four-door saloon with an all-steel body {{built around a}} central steel frame, which bears a resemblance to a 1949 Ford. The wings were fully integrated into the bodywork, and the passenger cabin filled the full width of the car. At a time when competitor vehicles from Opel and Mercedes Benz were still based on conventional looking prewar designs, the interior width of the Hansa, emphasized by the inclusion of bench seats both at the back and in the front, attracted favourable press comment. The car {{was seen as a}} genuine six-seater. [...] Also noteworthy in 1949 was the separate lid that permitted the boot / trunk to be accessed from outside the car. At the other end, the bonnet / hood was hinged at the side and could be opened from either the left or the right side as necessary. Instead of traditional semaphore style direction indicators, the Hansa featured flashing lights for use as direction <b>indicators,</b> the <b>flashing</b> being replicated within the tri-functional rear lights which included within a single unit rear lights and brake lights along with the US style <b>flashing</b> direction <b>indicators.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an advanced testing system, combining model-based testing and machine vision technologies, for automated design validation {{of a vehicle}} instrument cluster. In the system, a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) tester, supported by model-based approaches, simulates vehicle operations in real time and dynamically provides all essential signals to the instrument cluster under test. A machine vision system with advanced image processing algorithms is designed to inspect the visual displays. Experiments demonstrate that the system developed is accurate for measuring the pointer position, bar graph position, pointer angular velocity and <b>indicator</b> <b>flash</b> rate, and is highly robust for validating various functionalities including warning lights status, symbol and text displays. Moreover, the system developed greatly eases the task of tedious validation testing and makes onerous repeated tests possible...|$|R
40|$|PROSPECT aims at {{developing}} {{a new generation of}} proactive safety systems to protect Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs), with an emphasis on pedestrians and cyclists. To improve sensor effectiveness, PROSPECT will expand the scope of scenarios addressed by sensors already on the market, enhancing their overall performance. Interactions between vehicles and VRUs were investigated in real traffic situations to better understand critical situations and identify factors that lead to conflicts. As a result, VRU and vehicle modelling will be more effective, allowing safety systems to react earlier, without increasing false activation rates. Accident studies highlighted the most relevant use cases, and further naturalistic observations provided information that could not be inferred from accident databases regarding these use cases, such as trajectories and kinematic data (speed, acceleration, TTC or PET) throughout the conflict evolution. Data was also collected on VRU’s behaviors which forecast their intent in the near future (i. e. positional data, gestures). Lastly, naturalistic observations were used to look for correctly managed situations by the road users that could lead to false alarms in existing sensors. Two kinds of naturalistic observations were undertaken in three countries. A first data set (France and Hungary) was collected from on-site observations by infrastructure-mounted cameras. A second data set was collected by cars equipped with sensors and cameras (Hungary and Spain) to observe interactions with surrounding VRUs. Only situations of conflict with close proximity between road users both in space and time were studied. This important criterion qualified an encounter as a conflict. Low speed conflicts were excluded. Several hundred conflicts were collected, each classified according to use cases and annotated using a common grid. Different categories of parameters were investigated to describe: environmental conditions (light, precipitation, road surface, traffic density, etc.), infrastructure (layout, dedicated lanes, speed limit, etc.), VRU characteristics (type, equipment, etc.), encounter (visibility, right of way, yielding, conflict management, estimated impact point, etc.), intent (head/torso orientation, gesture, <b>flashing</b> <b>indicator),</b> kinematics and trajectories. Start and end timestamps were recorded for time dependent parameters such as yielding, head movements, etc. Finally, variants of use cases were obtained to describe potential conflict evolutions and determinant factors of this evolution. As annotations of conflicts were based on subjective evaluation of observers, training was required. Although training sessions were organized, materials differed between observations which could lead to some distortion. However, including objective data such as kinematics and trajectories mitigated data validity concerns. Severity of conflicts, for example, was first assessed by subjective measure (as filtering process), then revised by taking into account kinematic data as a more objective measure. We also considered inconsistent accuracy level of video processing algorithms for spatial data (trajectories and kinematics) ...|$|R
