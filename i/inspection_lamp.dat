40|$|A {{method for}} nucleic acid amplification, loop-mediated {{isothermal}} amplification (LAMP) is a novel, sensitive and rapid technique, {{which can be}} applied for disease diagnosis in aquaculture. Using the LAMP method, a highly specific and sensitive diagnostic system for infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV) detection was designed. A set of four primers was designed by targeting the IHHNV genome DNA. By the detection system, target DNA was amplified and visualized on agarose gel within 60 min under isothermal condition at 64 degrees C. Without gel electrophoresis, the LAMP amplicon was visualized directly in the reaction tube by addition of SYBR Green I for a naked-eye <b>inspection.</b> The <b>LAMP</b> reaction was also assessed by the white turbidity of magnesium pyrophosphate (a by-product of LAMP) in the tube. The assay had a detection limit of 5 - 500 copies of DNA template with gel electrophoresis, SYBR Green I and white turbidity with naked-eye inspection. The detection sensitivity of LAMP was 100 -fold higher than the PCR. A diagnostic procedure which is rapid and highly sensitive was developed for IHHNV detection. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} a new method for thermal nondestructive evaluation. This method uses a synchronized electronic shutter system (SESS) to remove the heat lamp's influence on the thermal data during and after flash heating. There are two main concerns when using flash heating. The first concern is during the flash when the photons are reflected back into the camera. This tends to saturate the detectors and potentially introduces unknown and uncorrectable errors when curve fitting the data to a model. To address this, an electronically controlled shutter was placed over the infrared camera lens. Before firing the flash lamps, the shutter is opened to acquire the necessary background data for offset calibration. During flash heating, the shutter is closed to prevent the photons from the high intensity flash from saturating the camera's detectors. The second concern is after the flash heating where the lamps radiate heat after firing. This residual cooling introduces an unwanted transient thermal response into the data. To remove this residual effect, a shutter was placed over the flash lamps to block the infrared heat radiating from the flash head after heating. This helped to remove the transient contribution of the flash. The flash lamp shutters were synchronized electronically with the camera shutter. Results are given comparing the use of the thermal inspection with and without the shutter system.

The primary aim was to compare RT with Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT) and to correlate with central corneal thickness (CCT).

" METHODS: In group 1 (52 eyes/ 28 patients), all measurements were taken by the same physician, {{in the same room}} and order: non-contact optical pachymetry, RT, slit <b>lamp</b> <b>inspection,</b> GAT. Patients were questioned about discomfort or pain. In group 2 (49 eyes/ 27 patients), tonometry was performed by three other physicians during routine examinations. RESULTS: RT was well tolerated and safe. Intraocular pressure (IOP) ranged between 6 mm Hg and 48 mm Hg. No different trends were found between the groups. RT tended to give slightly higher readings: n = 101, mean difference 1. 0 (SD 2. 17) mm Hg; 84. 1 % of RT readings within plus or minus 3 mm Hg of GAT; 95 % confidence interval in the Bland-Altman analysis - 3. 2 mm Hg to + 5. 2 mm Hg.

40|$|We {{describe}} here four sibs, born to consanguineous, healthy, asymptomatic parents.

Necropsy was done in {{only one of them}} and showed the typical findings of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) in the central nervous system (CNS), kidneys, heart, and liver. The fourth sib, currently 2 years old, also has typical signs of TSC, namely hypomelanotic skin macules and calcified subependymal nodules. Both parents and a living maternal grandmother had appropriate examination, which included skin <b>inspection</b> under Wood's <b>lamp,</b> dental examination, fundoscopy, echocardiography, abdominal and renal ultrasound, and head CT and MRI scans, and no signs of TSC were found in either parent or in the only living grandmother.

Linkage analysis and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) investigations on a variety of lesions obtained from postmortem and tissue or blood specimens from all available family members studied failed to identify a microdeletion in the chromosomal regions where TSC genes are located. It is very unusual that in a single TSC family there were three consecutive neonatal deaths, and very likely that all had cardiac rhabdomyomas.

40|$|Background. Several {{epidemiological}} investigations show {{a correlation}} between cataract development and the dose of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) received. It is experimentally well established that exposure of animal eyes to UVR induces cataract. Most cataracts develop as a gradual increase in lens opacity. Despite this, current estimations of toxicity for cataract {{are based on the}} concept that cataract is a binary event. Moreover, current exposure limits for UVR are based on subjective <b>inspections</b> with slit <b>lamp</b> microscopy. Purpose. The first {{purpose of the present study}} was to determine a statistically defined maximum acceptable dose for ultraviolet radiation-induced cataract based on quantitative data of forward light scattering in lenses. The second purpose was to find possible explanations for light scattering by investigating the morphology and the refractive index distribution in the lens. The third purpose was to describe the development of cataract after UVR on the cellular level. Methods. Six-week-old, female Sprague-Dawley rats received UVR unilaterally in vivo. The radiation from a high pressure mercury lamp was collimated, passed through a water filter and an interference filter or a mono-chromator (lMAX = 300 nm), and projected onto the cornea. The exposure time was 15 min. The exposure dose ranged between 0. 1 and 20 kJ/m 2 and the animals were kept between 6 hours and 32 weeks after exposure. The extracted lenses were photographed and forward light scattering was measured. Other methods included light microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, transmission and scanning electron microscopy, freeze-fracture and microradiography. Results and Conclusions. From a long-term experiment, it was concluded that UVR-exposed lenses scatter light more than their contralaterals and that a higher dose induces more light scattering. After exposure to 5 kJ/m 2, the mean forward light scattering remains unchanged between 1 and 32 weeks. Earlier observations, taken together with the current findings, indicate that the optimal time to detect low dose UVR-induced cataract is one week after exposure in rats. The intensity of forward light scattering increases exponentially with increased UVR dose between 0. 1 and 14 kJ/m 2. Based on this continuous dose-response, a method to determine a maximum acceptable dose to avoid UVR-induced cataract was developed. The statistically defined lower limit of pathologic light scattering is projected on the dose-response function. The dose corresponding to that point can be estimated and was suggested to be called the Maximum Acceptable Dose. Lenses exposed to UVR grow more slowly than their non-exposed contralaterals. Low doses led to decreased water content in the lens whereas high doses led to swelling. At 6 months after low dose UVR exposure, no global change of the refractive index was found. However, local variations of the refractive index induce a subtle cortical light scattering. In vivo low dose UVR induces programmed cell death which peaks 24 h post?exposure and involves the entire lens epithelium. Dead cells are removed from the epithelium by phagocytosis. After one week, extracellular spaces in the epithelium together with locally disarranged fibers produce a corrugated opaque lens surface and equatorial opacities. Within several weeks after exposure, the lens epithelium recovers, and new fibers develop normally. The lens fibers regain normal osmotic properties and fill up the extracellular spaces. Repair, however, is incomplete, and disarranged fibers remain in the cortex, producing a subtle shell-shaped opacity. In this way, subtle damage to the lens fibers induced by UVR may accumulate during a lifetime and contribute to the formation of cortical cataract...|$|R
