5|$|Despite Governor Catts' {{change of}} attitude, white mob action {{frequently}} occurred in towns throughout north and central Florida and went unchecked by local law enforcement. Extrajudicial violence against black residents was so common that it seldom {{was covered by}} newspapers. In 1920, whites removed four black men from jail, who were suspects accused of raping a white woman in Macclenny, and lynched them. In Ocoee the same year, two black citizens armed themselves to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> during an election. A confrontation ensued and two white election officials were shot, after which a white mob destroyed Ocoee's black community, causing as many as 30 deaths, and destroying 25 homes, two churches, and a Masonic Lodge. Just weeks before the Rosewood massacre, the Perry Race Riot occurred on 14 and 15 December 1922, in which whites burned Charles Wright at the stake and attacked the black community of Perry, Florida after a white schoolteacher was murdered. On the day following Wright's lynching, whites shot and hanged two more black men in Perry; next they burned the town's black school, Masonic lodge, church, amusement hall, and several families' homes.|$|E

25|$|Voter fatigue {{can lower}} turnout. If {{there are many}} {{elections}} in close succession, voter turnout will decrease as the public tires of participating. In low-turnout Switzerland, the average voter is invited to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> an average of seven times a year; the United States has frequent elections, with two votes per year on average, if one includes {{all levels of government}} as well as primaries. Holding multiple elections at the same time can increase turnout; however, presenting voters with massive multipage ballots, as occurs {{in some parts of the}} United States, can reduce turnouts.|$|E

500|$|A {{day before}} the elections, Gomułka appealed to Polish {{citizens}} not {{to vote against the}} Party's candidates, asserting that 'crossing them out would equal crossing Poland off the map of Europe' and would bring upon Poland the fate of Hungary. The fear of a possible Soviet intervention, in case of Gomułka's loss, was also repeated by Radio Free Europe, which noted that Gomułka's argument while [...] "cruel", is likely [...] "entirely correct." [...] Gomułka also persuaded the Catholic Church to urge voters to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> and declare a vote of confidence in the government. Supporting him, Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński officially declared his support for the 'no crossing' policy.|$|E

500|$|Bradley had {{initially}} been cool toward Taylor, but {{he agreed to}} tour the state with Republican leader Augustus E. Willson after Goebel, the eventual Democratic nominee, made a similar tour with William Jennings Bryan, who was wildly popular in the state. Although he insisted he only wanted to defend his administration from Democratic attacks, Henry Watterson suggested that Bradley was seeking to enlist Taylor's support for his anticipated senatorial bid. Bradley began his tour {{of the state in}} Louisville, charging that Democrats had to import an orator for their candidate because all of the state's best men had deserted him. He also encouraged blacks not to desert the Republican Party. He contrasted his appointments of blacks to his cabinet with the Democrats' support of the Separate Coach Bill. Throughout his speech, Bradley defended his administration and never once mentioned Taylor. Finally, he closed with the line [...] "And <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> and elect Taylor!" [...] As Bradley exited the stage, Willson whispered to him, [...] "Bradley, that's the slickest thing you ever did in your life." [...] As they continued to tour the state, Bradley and Willson often drew crowds larger than those assembled for Taylor.|$|E

2500|$|However, Roberta Combs, President of the Christian Coalition of America claims, [...] "Christian evangelicals {{made the}} major {{difference}} once again this year." [...] In the 2000 Presidential Election, there was some speculation that many evangelicals did not <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> and vote because of the October surprise of George W.

In a dozen swing states that decided the presidential election, moral values tied with the economy and jobs as the top issue in the campaign, according to Associated Press exit polls.|$|E

2500|$|The United States, {{observed}} in 1940 that [...] "many thousands of black cotton farmers each year now <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls,</b> {{stand in line}} with their white neighbors, and mark their ballots independently without protest or intimidation, {{in order to determine}} government policy toward cotton production control." [...] However, discrimination towards blacks continued {{as it did in the}} rest of society, and isolated incidents often broke out. On September 25, 1961, Herbert Lee, a black cotton farmer and voter-registration organizer, was shot in the head by a white state legislator in Liberty, Missouri. Yet the cotton industry continued to be very important for blacks in the southern United States, much more so than for whites. By the late 1920s around two-thirds of all African-American tenants and almost three-fourths of the croppers worked on cotton farms. Three out of four black farm operators earned at least 40% of their income from cotton farming during this period. Studies conducted during the same period indicated that two in three black women from black landowning families were involved in cotton farming.|$|E
