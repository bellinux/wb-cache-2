5|$|<b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> of the Star of Bethlehem {{described}} an actual event, it might identify the year Jesus was born. The Gospel of Matthew describes {{the birth of}} Jesus as taking place when Herod was king. According to Josephus, Herod died after a lunar eclipse and before a Passover Feast. The eclipse is usually identified as the eclipse of March 13, 4 BC. Other scholars suggested dates in 5 BC, because it allows seven months for the events Josephus documented between the lunar eclipse and the Passover than the 29 days allowed by lunar eclipse in 4 BC. Others suggest it was an eclipse in 1 BC. The narrative implies that Jesus was born sometime between the first appearance of the star {{and the appearance of}} the Magi at Herod's court. That the king is said to have ordered the execution of boys two years of age and younger implies that the Star of Bethlehem appeared within the preceding two years. Some scholars date the birth of Jesus as 6–4 BC, while others suggest Jesus' birth was in 3/2 BC.|$|E

5000|$|Summaries of the {{narratives}} (plots) {{of works of}} fiction are conventionally presented using the present tense rather than the past tense.

25|$|The Liberals won a huge {{majority}} with 72 seats, almost 70% of the 106- seat legislature. The Liberals {{not only}} won almost every {{seat in the}} city of Toronto, but every seat bordering on Toronto as well. All seven seats in Peel region went Liberal, as well as previously safe PC 905 seats like Markham, Oakville and Pickering-Ajax. The Liberals also made a major breakthrough in Southwestern Ontario, grabbing all three seats in London as well as rural seats like Perth-Middlesex, Huron-Bruce and Lambton-Kent. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> of the PC majorities in 1995 and 1999 were the marriage of rural and small-town conservative bedrock with voters in the suburbs, the 2003 election was a divorce of those suburban voters from rural Ontario and a new marriage to the mid-town professionals and New Canadians who make up the Liberal base.|$|E
25|$|A family story {{initially}} recounts {{an actual}} historical event concerning named family members. Seasoned {{with time and}} re-telling, the story gets revised and honed to express specific values and character traits valued in the family. Instead of historical accuracies, the narration becomes a medium to re-state and re-enforce shared values of the family group. These stories generally {{take the form of}} an anecdote and follow the pattern of many common traditional tales. A favorite family story involves how the parents met, or how they decided on the one true partner among several. In one family, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> is to be believed, the prospective bride had to untie all the knots in the string to demonstrate her care and diligence. Another family tells how the young couple got stuck {{at the top of a}} Ferris wheel when he proposed, and she had to either say yes or jump. Given time and repetition, the anecdotes serve to shape the family story as a whole, populating it with real individuals and historical events made personal. In their transmission, these stories serve to codify the norms of behavior within the family.|$|E

Akahori noted that up to the creation of Kashimashi, the works that he created were far apart from the concept of true love, and much of his previous work involved a lot of ecchi content which Akahori was attempting to avoid in Kashimashi. He wondered <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> would be interesting, and if he could surprise normal readers and fans of his previous works, if he wrote a true love story without much ecchi or fan service.|$|E
500|$|The Girls He Left Behind Him {{received}} {{praise from}} the reviewer from The Moving Picture World who stated, [...] " [...] comedy, {{not by any}} means original, but with a sentimental touch, ... this excellent film has placed in visible form these visions of the past which often haunt the middle aged or the younger person who about to take some important step.

500|$|One of the conspirators, Thomas Percy, was {{promoted}} in June 1604, {{gaining access to}} a house in London that belonged to John Whynniard, Keeper of the King's Wardrobe. [...] Fawkes was installed as a caretaker and began using the pseudonym John Johnson, servant to Percy. [...] The contemporaneous account of the prosecution (taken from Thomas Wintour's confession) claimed that the conspirators attempted to dig a tunnel from beneath Whynniard's house to Parliament, although this story {{may have been a}} government fabrication; no evidence for the existence of a tunnel was presented by the prosecution, and no trace of one has ever been found; Fawkes himself did not admit the existence of such a scheme until his fifth interrogation, but even then he could not locate the tunnel. [...] <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> is true, however, by December 1604 the conspirators were busy tunnelling from their rented house to the House of Lords.

500|$|The {{structure}} of the book drew mixed reactions, with Toronto Star's Kim Hughs describing it as [...] "the novel's most defining feature and its most exasperating conceit". She believed that Pari {{was meant to be}} the protagonist of the story but that the shifting focus on the numerous other personalities left her [...] "barely [...] through the clutter". The Independent's Arifa Akbar stated, [...] "The changing points of view and leaps in time can confuse and confine, leaving characters clearly defined but lacking depth. Decades gallop by and it is as <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> of these interconnected, cross -generational lives will simply go on echoing the original crime of Abdullah and Pari's separation." [...] Michiko Kakutani from The New York Times thought the novella-like storytelling was handled well and wrote, [...] "Khaled Hosseini's new novel, And the Mountains Echoed, may have the most awkward title in his body of work, but it's his most assured and emotionally gripping story yet, more fluent and ambitious than The Kite Runner (2003), more narratively complex than A Thousand Splendid Suns (2007)." [...] Kamal agreed, saying that the structure was [...] "exquisitely crafted". Scoop Empires Sherine El Banhawy added that the focus on multiple characters allowed to readers {{to gain a better understanding}} of the diversities of Afghan culture.|$|E
500|$|It was {{announced}} on 24December that the re-opening of Parliament would be delayed. Concern over the plague meant {{that rather than}} sitting in February, as the plotters had originally planned for, Parliament would not sit again until 3October 1605. [...] The contemporaneous account of the prosecution claimed that during this delay the conspirators were digging a tunnel beneath Parliament. [...] This {{may have been a}} government fabrication, as no evidence for the existence of a tunnel was presented by the prosecution, and no trace of one has ever been found. [...] The account of a tunnel comes directly from Thomas Wintour's confession, and Guy Fawkes did not admit the existence of such a scheme until his fifth interrogation. [...] Logistically, digging a tunnel would have proved extremely difficult, especially as none of the conspirators had any experience of mining. [...] <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> is true, by 6December the Scottish commissioners had finished their work, and the conspirators were busy tunnelling from their rented house to the House of Lords.

500|$|Although the State Opening of Parliament {{was planned}} for February 1605, {{concern over the}} plague delayed it until 3October. A {{contemporaneous}} government account has the plotters engaged in digging a tunnel beneath Parliament by December 1604, but no other evidence exists to prove this, and no trace of a tunnel has since been found. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> is true, the plotters ceased their efforts when the tenancy to the undercroft beneath the House of Lords became available. Several months later, early in June 1605, Catesby met the principal Jesuit in England, Father Henry Garnet, on Thames Street in London. While discussing the war in Flanders, Catesby asked about the morality of [...] "killing innocents". Garnet said that such actions could often be excused, but according to his own account during a second meeting in July he showed Catesby {{a letter from the}} pope which forbade rebellion. Catesby replied, [...] "Whatever I mean to do, if the Pope knew, he would not hinder for the general good of our country." [...] Father Garnet's protestations prompted Catesby's next reply, [...] "I am not bound to take knowledge by you of the Pope's will." [...] Soon after, Father Tesimond told Father Garnet that while taking Catesby's confession he had learned of the plot. Father Garnet met with Catesby a third time on 24July at White Webbs in Enfield Chase, the home of Catesby's wealthy relative Anne Vaux, and a house long suspected by the government of harbouring Jesuit priests. Without acknowledging that he was aware of the precise nature of the plot, the priest tried in vain to dissuade Catesby from his course.|$|E
500|$|Toriyama {{said that}} by {{the second half of}} the series, he had become more {{interested}} in coming up with the story than drawing it, and that the battles became more intense by him simplifying the lines. He also said he would get letters from readers complaining that the art had become [...] "too square", so he intentionally made it more so. Years later he stated that because Dragon Ball is an action manga the most important aspect is the sense of speed, so he did not draw very elaborately, suggesting that he was not interested in the art. As the manga progressed, he struggled with the Android and Cell arc, feeling that the manga could not outdo the Freeza arc. He added time travel, but said he had a hard time with the plot, only being able to think of what to do that week. After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for it and changed his mind. Even after the Cell arc, Toriyama felt it could not end there and so continued to the Majin Boo arc. Having resolved it would be the finale, he decided to draw what he wanted and inserted comedy with Gohan's Great Saiyaman persona and the character Gotenks. However, he did not think of an ending until the final chapter. At the time, Toriyama said he gave Dragon Ball a low-key ending to make it seem as <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> might continue. But would later say he skipped 10 years ahead in the story to signal that it was truly the end. Wanting to make it clear that Goku's battles were over, and a new generation was taking over, Toriyama added a message to the ending for the kanzenban re-release of Dragon Ball which finished in 2004.|$|E
