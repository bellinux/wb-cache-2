40|$|Abstract:-In {{the current}} {{practice}} of analysis {{and design of}} steel-frame building structure, the actual behaviour of beam-column connection is generally simplified to the two idealized extremes of either fully regid behaviour or ideally pinned behaviour. However, most connections used in current practice actually exhibit semi-rigid deformation behaviour that can contribute substantially to overall displacements of the structure and to the distribution of member forces. So it is very necessary that studying the behavior of these semi-rigid connections under cyclic reversal loading. Three full-scale specimens <b>of</b> <b>angles</b> steel using H-section members had been conducted. The specimens were subjected to cyclic reversal loading simulating earthquake effects on a steel moment-resisting force. The objective {{of the work is}} to determine the behavior of these connections under cyclic reversal loading well into the inelastic range and to ascertain the effect of design parameters such as column <b>flange</b> stiffener, pre-tension <b>of</b> bolts and the angles flange thickness on the overall behavior. Observations were made concerning the response of the connections and its elements in terms of strength, stiffness and energy dissipation. Information on the design of these connections is presented. The hysteretic behavior <b>of</b> <b>angles</b> beam-column connections under cyclic loading is presented in this paper. Rotational stiffness, the carrying capacity and ductility of top-seat and web angles connections are analyzed. It is concluded that angles connections can possess the relative high stiffness, strength and excellent ductility as moment-resisting components in the seismic design of frames. Most of the input energy was dissipated in the <b>flange</b> <b>of</b> <b>angles</b> while the column participated a little in the energy dissipation process in the test.

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} shows a {{development}} {{and analysis of}} 2 -D axisymmetric CFD model of flanged diffuser that {{was used as a}} casing for developed small wind turbines to increase the generated power. The 2 -D CFD diffuser model grids are developed by GAMBIT, while the flow field analysis has been carried out using commercial software FLUENT. This study focuses on the effect <b>of</b> <b>flange’s</b> <b>angles</b> as a varied parameter on velocity at diffuser entrance. All models have the same dimensions in diffuser length, entrance diameter, exit diameter and flange height but differ in <b>flange</b> <b>angle.</b> <b>Flange</b> <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> these tested models vary from − 25 ° to + 25 °, where flange angles were measured to vertical axis. Present model verification indicates a good agreement between present numerical work and previous published experimental work. The numerical simulation shows the created vortices behind flange that cause pressure drop which increases mass flow rate through the diffuser. The results indicate also that the right flange angle at 15 ° is the optimum angle that accelerates flow at diffuser entrance. The increase of velocity at this optimum flange angles is higher than the case <b>of</b> normal <b>angle,</b> where the expected increase in the generated power by wind turbine can reach 5 % more compared with normal flange...|$|R
500|$|During her {{sea trials}} in November 1916 off the River Tyne, Courageous {{sustained}} structural damage while running {{at full speed}} in a rough head sea. The forecastle deck was deeply buckled in three places between the breakwater and the forward turret. In addition, the side plating was visibly buckled between the forecastle and upper decks. Water had entered the submerged torpedo room and rivets had sheared in the vertical <b>flange</b> <b>of</b> the <b>angle</b> iron securing the deck armour in place. The exact cause remains uncertain, but Courageous received [...] of stiffening in response; Glorious did not receive her stiffening until 1918. Courageous also was temporarily fitted as a minelayer in April 1917, but never actually laid any mines. In mid-1917 both ships received a dozen torpedo tubes in pairs: one mount {{on each side of}} the mainmast on the upper deck and two mounts {{on each side of the}} rear turret on the quarterdeck. Courageous and Glorious served together throughout the war. Both ships were initially assigned to the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron and later reconstituted the 1st Cruiser Squadron (CS).|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The staged {{connections}} of {{the beams}} of railway bridge track-way have the simplest design, but some design flaws result in numerous defects. The purpose of the given work is to research the actual stress-train state of the point of connection of the stringers with the floor beams on condition of their staged interposition. It is also necessary to determine possible effect of coupled work of deck beam grid and booms on their stress-strain state. Methodology. To reach {{the purpose of the}} study the testing of the existing bridge was conducted. To measure strains (stresses) in the span elements we used the strain gages glued to <b>flange</b> <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> stringers and floor beams and to fillets <b>of</b> lower <b>flange</b> <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> stringers in the points of their support on floor beams. To measure deflections of the truss, stringers and floor beams from static loads we used Aistov’s and Maksimov’s deflectometers, that were installed on lower boom in the middle of span 0 - 1, as well as on both stringers and floor beams in the middle of the span. Deflectometers were fastened to the span and, by wire communication, to the ground surface. Findings. Stress-strain state of the point of connection of the stringers with the floor beams on condition of their staged interposition was obtained and analyzed. Analysis indicates that, apart from vertical bending of the stringers and beams, there is a significant effect of horizontal bending of floor beams and their torsion, that occur due to the coupled work of track-way beams and top booms, both for P 0 beam and for other beams. Originality. Research of stress-strain state of metal track-way staged beams while considering their coupled work with bearing trusses. Practical value. While testing the span under the train load, there are significant additional stresses from horizontal bending of floor beams and their torsion in the floor beam <b>flanges.</b> The appearance <b>of</b> these stresses is caused by inclusion of stringers into coupled work with top booms. Appearing flaws in stringers are caused by local stress concentration due to design features of staged track way...|$|R

40|$|With an {{increasing}} demand {{to reduce the}} body weight of motor vehicles, advanced high strength steel (AHSS) is widely applied in the automobile industry. However, high residual stresses and redundant deformation caused by the cold roll forming process are still outstanding problems. Under such circumstances, Chain-die forming technology is developed. Through enlargement of the effective roll radius, the deformation length is significantly stretched, leading to {{a significant reduction in}} residual stresses and redundant strain. In this study, Chain-die formed AHSS U-channel products are investigated experimentally and numerically. The influences of a number of features such as material strength, sheet metal thickness, vertical forming gap, and effective virtual roll radius are discussed regarding average flange angle and the variation <b>of</b> <b>flange</b> <b>angle</b> along the longitudinal direction. The results show that the average flange angle decreases with the increase of material strength, vertical forming gap, and effective virtual roll radius. Furthermore, among all four controllable variables, effective virtual roll radius has the most significant impact on the variation <b>of</b> the <b>flange</b> <b>angle</b> along the longitudinal direction...|$|R

40|$|Corrugated {{panels are}} {{currently}} used in petrochemical facilities {{as an economic}} means to provide blast protection to personnel and other valuable assets. In this paper, parametric studies were conducted on the various elements (e. g., compression <b>flange,</b> depth, <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> corrugation, etc.) of a corrugated blast wall using static nonlinear finite element analyses and dynamic nonlinear single degree of freedom analyses. During the static analyses, panel characteristics such as ductility and strength were explored and nonlinear load-deflection curves were generated. The load-deflection curves were then used to observe the response of each wall using a single degree of freedom time-step integration method. Results showed that some blast wall profiles have a greater ability to limit reaction loads transferred to the primary structure, reduce material cost / panel thickness, and/or protect nearby assets (deformation control). The results contained herein define specific dimensional ratios for elements {{that will result in}} a favorable response. Understanding how the different elements of a corrugated blast wall affect its structural response to a blast enables the engineer to design efficient passive protection systems that dissipate blast energy efficiently...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{a series of}} web crippling tests on cold-formed unlipped channels with flanges restrained (fastened) as well as channels with flanges unrestrained (unfastened). The tests were performed under end and interior two-flange loading conditions specified in the North American Specification and Australian/New Zealand Standard for cold-formed steel structures, namely end-two-flange and interior-two-flange loading conditions. The concentrated load was applied by a bearing plate at the top <b>flange</b> <b>of</b> the channels, and the reaction force applied by an identical bearing plate at the bottom <b>flange</b> <b>of</b> the channels. The bearing plates acted across the full <b>flange</b> widths <b>of</b> the channels. The <b>flanges</b> <b>of</b> the channels were either bolted {{to one or two}} bearing plates for the specimens with flanges restrained. The web crippling test strengths are compared with the design strengths obtained using the North American Specification, Australian/New Zealand Standard and American Iron and Steel Institute Specification for cold-formed steel structures. It is shown that the design strengths predicted by the North American Specification using the unfastened design rules are generally conservative, but unconservatively predicted using the fastened design rules, even when the <b>flanges</b> <b>of</b> the specimens were restrained. The design strengths predicted by the Australian/New Zealand Standard and American Iron and Steel Institute Specification are unconservative. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
