5|$|Despite {{the various}} charters, the {{provision}} of royal justice was inconsistent and driven by the needs of immediate politics: sometimes action would be taken to address a legitimate baronial complaint, while on other occasions the problem would simply be ignored. The royal courts, which toured the country to provide <b>justice</b> <b>at</b> the local level, typically for lesser barons and the gentry claiming grievances against major lords, had little power, allowing the major barons to dominate the local justice system. Henry's rule became lax and careless, resulting in a reduction in royal authority in the provinces and, ultimately, the collapse of his authority at court.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the various}} charters, the {{provision}} of royal justice was inconsistent and driven by the needs of immediate politics: sometimes action would be taken to address a legitimate baronial complaint, on other occasions, the problem would simply be ignored. The royal eyres, courts which toured the country to provide <b>justice</b> <b>at</b> the local level, typically for those lesser barons and the gentry claiming grievances against the major lords, had little power, allowing the major barons to dominate the local justice system. The power of royal sheriffs also declined during Henry's reign. They were now often lesser men appointed by the exchequer, rather than coming from important local families, and they focused on generating revenue for the King. Their robust attempts to enforce fines and collect debts generated much unpopularity among the lower classes. Unlike his father, Henry did not exploit the large debts that the barons frequently owed to the Crown, and was slow to collect any sums of money due to him.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the Free Expression Policy Project {{assisted}} 33 academics {{specializing in}} journalism, with filing a friend-of-the-court brief challenging a law which restricted {{the sale of}} violent video games to youths. In 2004 the organization operated at the National Coalition Against Censorship. In 2005 the organization {{was part of the}} Brennan Center for <b>Justice</b> <b>at</b> New York University Law School. Within the Brennan Center for Justice, the FEPP operated through the Democracy Program at the law school. In 2006 the organization, in collaboration with the Brennan Center for Justice, released a report on the inefficiency of Internet filtering. The 87-page report concluded that academic-based censorship of material on the Internet was far too broad and harmed free expression of ideas. The FEPP became independent from both the National Coalition Against Censorship and the Brennan Center for Justice in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{administration}} of <b>justice</b> <b>at</b> village level was the responsibility of village assemblies, which usually consisted of the elders of the village. However, {{towards the end of}} the Anuradhapura Kingdom a group of ten villages, known as dasagam, was responsible for upholding justice in that area. The laws and legal measures to be followed by them were proclaimed by the king. Several rock inscriptions that record these proclamations have been found in archaeological excavations. Punishments differed from ruler to ruler. Some kings, such as Sanghabodhi (247–249) and Voharika Tissa (209–231) were lenient in this aspect, while rulers like Ilanaga (33–43) and Jetthatissa I (263–273) were harsher. However, crimes such as treason, murder and slaughter of cattle were generally punishable by death.|$|E

5|$|King's College London {{was founded}} in 1828. The Strand Campus, based next to the church of St Mary-le-Strand, was {{designed}} by Robert Smirke and constructed in 1829–31. King's College Hospital opened as {{a branch of the}} college in 1840, and became a constituent part of the University of London in 1908. The current campus building was constructed in 1966. In 2015, the college acquired Strand House, Bush House and other buildings in the Aldwych Quarter. The Royal Courts of <b>Justice,</b> <b>at</b> the eastern end of the Strand, was designed in the mid-1860s by G.E. Street as a replacement for the older courts at Westminster Hall, though construction was so delayed that he died shortly before Queen Victoria opened the courts in 1882. The West Green extension to the courts opened in 1911, while the Queen's Building opened in 1968.|$|E
5|$|Warenne {{was one of}} a {{group of}} justices– {{including}} Richard Barre, Ralph Foliot, Richard Herriard, and William of Sainte-Mère-Église– who were appointed in 1194 by the Lord Chancellor Hubert Walter as justices for a new general eyre, to relieve the Barons of the Exchequer of some of their judicial duties. In 1195 Warenne served as a royal <b>justice</b> <b>at</b> Oxford with Hubert Walter, William Brewer and Geoffrey of Buckland. Warenne served again as a justice in 1198–1199 and then again during the first two years of the reign of John. His last service as a justice was in 1200. In 1200 John removed Warenne as a royal justice and appointed him as one of the four Justices for the Jews, replacing Simon of Pattishall. These officials had been created in 1194 and were not concerned with judicial matters concerning Jews, but rather with the collection of debts owed to Jews by Christians. Warenne continued in that office until 1209. Besides judicial duties, Warenne also served in other capacities, working with Barre and Osbert fitzHervey to collect the carucage in 1194 in eastern England. In 1199 he again served with Barre and fitzHervey to impose amercements in the counties of Cambridge, Northamptonshire, Huntingdonshire, Norfolk and Suffolk.|$|E
