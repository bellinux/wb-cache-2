Great {{advantages}} of cassava over other crops are not only the capacity of carbohydrates, {{but it is also}} an easily grown crop with fast development. As a plant which is highly tolerant to a poor environment, cassava has been believed to own an effective acclimation process, an intelligent mechanism behind its sur-vival and sustainability {{in a wide range of}} climates. Herein, we aimed to investigate the tran-scriptional regulation underlying the adaptive development of a cassava root to different seasonal cultivation climates. Gene co-expression analysis suggests that AP 2 -EREBP transcription factor (ERF 1) orthologue (D 142) played a pivotal role in regulating the cellular response to exposing to wet and dry seasons. The ERF shows crosstalk with gibberellin, via ent-Kaurene synthase (D 106), in the transcriptional regulatory network that was proposed to modulate the downstream regulatory system through a distinct signaling mechanism.

Up to now, a reliable and easy method for plant root discrimination does not exist. In a recent study, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy with an attenuated total reflection (ATR) device was successfully applied in root discrimination of distantly related plant species (pea/oat). In this experiment, we wanted to test the potential of FTIR-ATR spectroscopy to discriminate roots of closely related crop/weed-combinations. In a greenhouse experiment, two crop and associated weed species were cultivated: Maize/barnyard grass (Zea mays/Echinochloa crus-galli) and sugar beet/common lambsquarters (Beta vulgaris/Chenopodium album). To allow inter- and intra-specific competition, plants were grown sole and in crop/weed-combinations. Six weeks after sowing, root biomass was harvested and rinsed with water to remove soil particles. The absorbance patterns of fresh and dry rootlets were recorded by FTIRATR spectroscopy. Spectra of fresh rootlets within one plant family showed similar peak distribution, while dry rootles differ in peak location and height.

40|$|In many <b>dry</b> <b>crop</b> {{production}} {{regions of}} the world, food-insecure farmers rely on sorghum because of its drought tolerance and ability to yield with low inputs. In Central America and Sub-Saharan Africa, these farmers grow photoperiod sensitive (PS) sorghums, which match natural rainfall patterns with the varieties? growth and development so that they grow in the rainy season and mature into the dry season. Hybrids, despite their proven yield increases, have not been adopted in these regions. While {{there are several reasons}} for the absence of hybrids in these systems, an important factor is the complicated logistics of producing photoperiod-sensitive hybrids and the poor seed production systems in the region. To bypass these limitations, PS hybrids were created from photoperiod-insensitive (PI) parents, allowing the seed to be produced anywhere in the world. The objectives of the study were to 1) assess PS hybrids for heterosis and grain quality and 2) review and assess the potential of this seed production system. Results indicate that grain yield heterosis is present in PS hybrids at high enough levels to be economically viable. In addition, variability for grain quality and for grain yield suggests that further breeding progress can be made.

The effects of different crop management factors were studied in long- term experiments on chernozem soil in Eastern Hungary. The fertilizer responses of wheat varieties depended on the crop year (6. 5 - 8. 2 t ha - 1 in 2011 - 2014 years) and the genotype (in 2012 the difference was 2. 7 t ha - 1 among genotypes). The optimum N(+PK) dose varied between 30 - 150 kg ha - 1 in different crop years. The N-doses over optimum caused NO 3 -N accumulation in chernozem soil (from 32 mg kg - 1 to 170 mg kg - 1).

40|$|Swine {{effluent}} {{has been}} applied to soils to promote nutrient cycling and reduce the uncontrolled disposal of effluents into bodies of water. However, the use of these effluents on various crops has raised environmental and public health concerns. Oilseed radish crop (Raphanus sativus L.) is a winter crop planted in no-tillage systems as a green fertilizer that also can be used for biodiesel, and it requires high levels of nutrients for its development. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the environmental and agronomic effects of the application of swine wastewater on oilseed radish. The experiment was conducted in a 0. 162 ha area with the following treatments: unirrigated (rainfed), irrigated, and fertilized with swine wastewater (370 m 3 ha- 1 cycle- 1). After each rainfall event, analyses were conducted for the main macro and micronutrients in the runoff and percolated material from drainage lysimeters. Changes in the physical and chemical characteristics of the soil were also analyzed, as were the agronomic and nutritional indices of the <b>dry</b> <b>crop</b> phytomass in full blooming stage. Application of swine wastewater at a level of 370 m 3 ha- 1 produces a crop with better agronomic quality.

Its expansion of usage to new areas with limited water and its response to stress conditions are of interest. Thus investigations were made as to the physiological and metabolic activity of newly developed dwarfed, hybridized pearl millets under field and growth chamber conditions. Plant responses to moisture stress and temperature stress were evaluated in regard to grain filling duration and yield components. ^ To evaluate termination of the grain filling period, radioactive assimilate translocation to maturing kernels was used to quantify physiological maturity {{in relation to the}} kernel dark layer. The use of this visual indicator was found to be rapid and effective in judging the cessation of dry weight accumulation. ^ A range of field soil moisture conditions were created by a line source sprinkler system under which three genotypes each of pearl millet and of grain sorghum were observed for moisture response reactions. Plant status and crop water use were monitored on a weekly basis during each season and water use of pearl millets appeared to be equal to that of sorghums, despite lower productivity by millets. Grain yield responses of both crops increased linearly with increased evapotranspiration but millet showed a slight decrease in water use efficiency with increased supplemental water whereas sorghum displayed an increase. Pressure chamber estimates of leaf xylem pressure potential indicated that only very small differences in readings related to large differences in grain yield. Panicle gas exchange rates of both crops were not significantly different with varying soil moisture levels but were very responsive to temperature.

The performance of furrow irrigation can be improved by measuring furrow irrigation advance rate, from which optimised values for irrigation parameters can be determined and implemented in subsequent irrigations. Most water detection methods for advance rate measurement use water sensors that {{are located in the}} furrow, and which must be tediously collected from the furrow after the irrigation takes place. Design of an alternate system for advance rate measurement has emphasised convenient, immediate recovery of advance data. Machine vision was investigated as an approach for measuring advance rate for furrow irrigation. A high resolution digital camera at a fixed location {{at the end of the}} field monitors changes in field appearance during an irrigation. In the absence of a crop canopy, an unobstructed view of the advancing water front can be obtained from the end of the field. For more mature crops, under certain conditions, change in crop canopy appearance during an irrigation also travels visibly down the field. The digital camera has been interfaced with a laptop so that images can be captured, downloaded and analysed during the irrigation. Field trials indicate that a single camera can detect objects for distances up to 500 metres with an accuracy of + or - 5 metres, by use of optical zoom and by increasing the height of the camera. Experiments reveal significant tonal response of <b>dry</b> <b>crop</b> plants to water within twenty minutes of application of water.

40|$|Abstract- India {{produces}} about 150 {{million tons}} of food grains per year and production is rising due to higher cropping intensities {{and the introduction of}} high-yielding varieties. However, annual post production losses are 10 %, which means that about 15 {{million tons of}} food grains are lost during harvesting, threshing, and storage. So these losses can be minimized by a drying operation that can preserve grain.
