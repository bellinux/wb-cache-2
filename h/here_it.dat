5|$|The most {{interesting}} aspects of Irish phonotactics {{revolve around the}} behavior of consonant clusters. <b>Here</b> <b>it</b> is important to distinguish between clusters that occur at the beginnings of words and those that occur after vowels, although there is overlap between the two groups.|$|E
5|$|The route {{begins at}} U.S. Route 101 at the Joe Colla Interchange, where {{it acts as}} a {{continuation}} of I-280 eastward. From <b>here,</b> <b>it</b> begins its journey northward through San Jose, where it meets the Capitol Expressway, signed as CR G21, about a mile northeast of I-680's southern terminus. The next exit northbound is SR 130, which {{is also known as}} Alum Rock Avenue, unsigned at the intersection. As it continues through Santa Clara County, it meets numerous local roads before interchanging with the Montague Expressway. <b>Here,</b> <b>it</b> exits San Jose and enters the city of Milpitas, California, where it meets SR 237, often referred to as Calaveras Boulevard. After one more intersection, I-680 exits Santa Clara County and enters Alameda County.|$|E

5|$|A Sudoku with 24 clues, {{dihedral}} symmetry (symmetry on both orthogonal axis, 90° rotational symmetry, 180° rotational symmetry, and diagonal symmetry) {{is known}} to exist, and is also automorphic. Again <b>here,</b> <b>it</b> is not known if this number of clues is minimal for this class of Sudoku. The fewest clues in a Sudoku with two-way diagonal symmetry {{is believed to be}} 18, and in at least one case such a Sudoku also exhibits automorphism.|$|E
5|$|After the Allegheny River {{crossing}} the turnpike returns to four lanes, {{passing through the}} Oakmont Country Club. The highway heads southeast to Monroeville, an eastern suburb of Pittsburgh; an interchange with I-376/US22 (Penn–Lincoln Parkway) provides access to Pittsburgh. East of Monroeville, the turnpike continues through eastern Allegheny County before crossing into Westmoreland County. <b>Here,</b> <b>it</b> heads south to the exit for US30 in Irwin.|$|E

5|$|At {{the border}} with Deptford Township, Route 47 reaches an {{intersection}} known as Five Points. Here, the road meets Route 41, County Route 603, and County Route 630. Route 47 turns northwest as this intersection and runs through wooded areas with some dwellings, with Route 55 intersecting the route at a cloverleaf interchange a short distance later. Past this interchange, the road continues through wooded inhabited areas, eventually turning due north. It comes to an intersection with the western terminus of County Route 534 as the route heads through more suburban homes along with businesses. Past this intersection, Route 47 passes businesses before crossing over the New Jersey Turnpike without an interchange. From <b>here,</b> <b>it</b> heads through more inhabited areas before entering Westville. Upon entering Westville, the route has a partial cloverleaf interchange with Interstate 295. Past this interchange, the road runs through neighborhoods, intersecting County Route 621 (Almonesson Road) and County Route 551. The latter forms a concurrency with Route 47 and these two routes run northeast through commercial areas as a four-lane undivided road, crossing the Big Timber Creek into Brooklawn, Camden County. <b>Here,</b> <b>it</b> comes to a traffic circle with U.S. Route 130 and County Route 753, where Route 47 ends and County Route 551 continues on to Camden, forming a brief concurrency with U.S. Route 130.|$|E
5|$|East of US285, {{the route}} enters {{the town of}} Center, where it skirts {{the south side of}} town as 8th Street. <b>Here,</b> <b>it</b> meets a {{railroad}} that connects the town to Sugar Junction farther south. The route moves east through farmland, where it meets County Road 100, which continues south to SH15. It then skirts along the county line all the way east to SH17 at the north side of Hooper.|$|E
5|$|Hearing {{and balance}} are both {{generated}} in the inner ear. The movement of liquids within the inner ear is generated by motion (for balance) and transmitted vibrations generated by the ossicles (for sound). This creates a nerve signal that passes through the vestibulocochlear nerve. From <b>here,</b> <b>it</b> passes through to the cochlear nuclei, the superior olivary nucleus, the medial geniculate nucleus, and finally the auditory radiation to the auditory cortex.|$|E

5|$|M-154 {{has existed}} on Harsens Island since 1931.

In late 1932 or early 1933, rather than routing M-154 onto Little Avenue, it was rerouted along LaCroix Road where it curves onto Columbine Street to North Channel Road where it terminates at the present day ferry dock.|$|E
5|$|NY376 follows Raymond Avenue {{for about}} a mile (1.6km) to the hamlet of Arlington. <b>Here,</b> <b>it</b> meets US44 and NY55, both of which follow a one-way couplet along Haight Street (eastbound) and Maple Street (westbound) through the city of Poughkeepsie. In between the two streets, NY376 intersects Main Street (CR114). The route ends upon {{intersecting}} westbound US44 and NY55, {{at which point the}} routing of NY376 becomes an unnumbered town road named Van Wagner Road.|$|E
5|$|NY380 {{began at}} the modern {{intersection}} of NY60 and CR44 in the Ellicott community of Kimball Stand. The route proceeded west along modern CR44 {{to what is now}} CR380, where it turned north to join the current alignment of CR380. NY380 left the vicinity of Kimball Stand and headed northwest along the base of a valley surrounding Cassadaga Creek to the hamlet of Towerville, where it intersected with CR59 and CR48. After leaving Towerville, Route380 went northward into the town of Ellery. <b>Here,</b> <b>it</b> intersected CR52 and CR66 in Redbird, a community in the extreme northeastern corner of the town.|$|E
