5|$|Many {{children}} with AS are initially misdiagnosed with {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD). Diagnosing adults is more challenging, as standard diagnostic criteria are designed for children and the expression of AS changes with age. Adult diagnosis requires painstaking clinical examination and thorough medical history gained from both the individual and other people who <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>person,</b> focusing on childhood behavior.|$|E
25|$|Psychiatrists and {{clinical}} psychologists are often asked {{to evaluate a}} patient's capacity for making life-and-death decisions {{at the end of}} life. Persons with a psychiatric condition such as delirium or clinical depression may lack capacity to make end-of-life decisions. For these persons, a request to refuse treatment may be taken {{in the context of their}} condition. Unless there is a clear advance directive to the contrary, persons lacking mental capacity are treated according to their best interests. This will involve an assessment involving people who <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> best to what decisions the person would have made had they not lost capacity. Persons with the mental capacity to make end-of-life decisions may refuse treatment with the understanding that it may shorten their life. Psychiatrists and psychologists may be involved to support decision making.|$|E
500|$|Jayma Mays commented {{of their}} relationship: [...] "Oh no! I don’t know if I can say! That’s a hard {{question}} {{because when you}} see the scenes of Emma and Will, you obviously think 'Oh of course they’re supposed to be together, of course, of course!' but the fact is, is that he’s a married man and Emma knows that’s wrong, and she doesn’t want to be a homewrecker. She doesn’t want to ruin a relationship. So I guess in a perfect world, she could find someone like Will, or maybe Ken Tanaka (laughs) can become a little bit more like Will. But maybe it’s all about respect. Maybe if she can respect Ken enough, that will develop into true love." [...] She also commented of her co-star Matthew Morrison (Will): [...] "We were friends. We knew each other before we started this job. We worked together once before. So, that’s always helpful when you <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> that you’re working with, and you already feel comfortable around them. But yeah, he’s a really good friend, so that makes that stuff a little bit easier." ...|$|E

500|$|Madonna's initial work on {{the album}} had started with Shep Pettibone, who {{produced}} her fifth studio album, Erotica (1992). However, she found {{out that they were}} doing the same vein of music from the previous album, which did not please her. At the time, Madonna was a fan of Babyface's song [...] "When Can I See You" [...] (1994), and became interested in working with him, as she wanted [...] "lush ballads" [...] for her record. They would collaborate on three songs for the album in his studio in Beverly Hills, with [...] "Forbidden Love" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow" [...] ending up on the album. Recalling the latter's development, the producer commented, [...] "I wasn't so much thinking about the charts. I think I was more in awe of the fact that I was working with Madonna. It was initially surreal, but then you get to <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> a little bit, and you calm down and then it's just work. And work is fun". He also said that for [...] "Forbidden Love", [...] "She heard the basic track and it all started coming out, melodies and everything... It was a much easier process than I thought it would be".|$|E
2500|$|Șăineanu also {{commented on}} the alleged {{oscillations}} of Tocilescu, who, after agreeing to lead the History section upon its recommended division, and supporting his Jewish colleague for chairmanship of the Letters section, threw his support behind Urechia. Nastasă, who mentions the scheming {{on the part of}} Urechia and Tocilescu, cites Moses Gaster's letter to Șăineanu, which defined Tocilescu as a double-crosser, [...] "a filthy twicer and a bloodsucker". The complications eventually led Șăineanu to present his resignation, and Maiorescu to accept it. He recalled: [...] "Every reasonable man would doubtlessly assume that [...] the resentment Mr. Urechia held against this unfortunate nomination would have been appeased. To assume thus would mean not to <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> or the Romanian social environment well enough, for barely two months had passed before grandiose patriotism again displayed the effects of its hatred." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vera {{asked if}} there was {{anything}} she could do to help with family matters. Inayat Khan said that, should she go missing, she would like Vera to avoid worrying her mother as far as possible. The normal procedure, as Inayat Khan knew, was that when an agent went to the field, Vera would send out a periodic [...] "good news" [...] letters to the family, letting them <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> concerned was well. If the agent went missing, the family would be told so. What Inayat Khan was suggesting was that bad news should be broken to her mother only if it was beyond any doubt that she was dead. Vera said she would agree to this arrangement if it was what she wanted. With this assurance Inayat Khan seemed content and confident once more. Any doubts in Vera's mind were also now settled.|$|E

60|$|I felt, accordingly, that my {{good friend}} Fairscribe, on the present occasion, had {{acquired}} something of a similar increase of consequence. But a week since, he had, in my opinion, been indeed an excellent-meaning man, perfectly competent to every thing within his own profession, but immured, at the same time, among its forms and technicalities, and as incapable of judging of matters of taste as any mighty Goth whatsoever, of or belonging to the ancient Senate-House of Scotland. But what of that? I had made him my judge by my own election; and I have often observed, that an idea of declining such a reference, {{on account of his}} own consciousness of incompetency, is, as it perhaps ought to be, the last which occurs to the referee himself. He that has a literary work subjected to his judgment by the author, immediately throws his mind into a critical attitude, though the subject be one which he never before thought of. No doubt the author is well qualified to select his own judge, and why should the arbiter whom he has chosen doubt his own talents for condemnation or acquittal, since he has been doubtless picked out by his friend, from his indubitable reliance on their competence? Surely, the man who wrote the production is likely to <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> best qualified to judge of it.|$|E
60|$|Besides, {{there is}} a {{particular}} nicety in the credit of a tradesman, which does not reach in other cases: a man is slandered in his character, or reputation, and it is injurious; and if it comes {{in the way of}} a marriage, or of a preferment, or post, it may disappoint and ruin him; but if this happens to a tradesman, he is immediately and unavoidably blasted and undone; a tradesman has but two sorts of enemies to encounter with, namely, thieves breaking open his shop, and ill neighbours blackening and blasting his reputation; and the latter are the worst thieves of the two, by a great deal; and, therefore, people should indeed be more chary of their discourse of tradesmen, than of other men, and that as they would not be guilty of murder. I knew an author of a book, who was drawn in unwarily, and without design, to publish a scandalous story of a tradesman in London. He (the author) was imposed upon by a set of men, who did it maliciously, and he was utterly ignorant of the wicked design; nor did he <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>person,</b> but rashly published the thing, being himself too fond of a piece of news, which he thought would be grateful to his readers; nor yet did he publish the person's name, so cautious he was, though that was not enough, as it proved, for the person was presently published by those who had maliciously done it.|$|E
