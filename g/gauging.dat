5|$|A <b>gauging</b> {{station was}} {{constructed}} on Buffalo Creek near Lewisburg in September 1913. In the early 1900s, the main {{industries in the}} creek's watershed included agriculture, furniture factories, flour mills, and brick works. The tributary Spruce Run was also used as a water supply by the White Deer Mountain Water Company and the main stem was used as power for some small gristmills. During this time period, major communities in the watershed included Lewisburg (3085 people), Mifflinburg (1559 people), Mazeppa (185 people), Cowan (150 people), Buffalo Roads (142 people), and Kelly Point (97 people). The Pennsylvania Railroad also went through {{the southern part of}} the watershed during the early 1900s.|$|E
5|$|Adults outnumber juveniles in most populations, but <b>gauging</b> the ratios is {{difficult}} because juveniles are harder to catch; with current sampling methods, estimates of age distribution vary widely. Annual survival rate of painted turtles increases with age. The probability of a painted turtle surviving from the egg to its first birthday is only 19%. For females, the annual survival rate rises to 45% for juveniles and 95% for adults. The male survival rates follow a similar pattern, but are lower overall than females, creating an average male age {{lower than that of}} the female. Natural disasters can confound age distributions. For instance, a hurricane can destroy many nests in a region, resulting in fewer hatchlings the next year. Age distributions may also be skewed by migrations of adults.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1917, {{divisions}} {{had begun}} appearing between the Ghadar Party in America on the one hand, and the Berlin Committee and the German high command on the other. Reports from German agents working with Ghadarites in Southeast Asia and the United States clearly indicated to the European wing a significant element of disorganisation, as well as unrealism in <b>gauging</b> public mood and support within the Ghadarite organisation. The failure of the February plot, the lack of bases in Southeast Asia following China's participation {{in the war in}} 1917, and the problems of supporting a Southeast Asian operation through the sea stemmed the plans significantly. Infiltration by British agents, change in American attitude and stance, and the changing fortunes of the war meant the massive conspiracy for revolution within India never succeeded.|$|E
5|$|Glacier National Park has {{a highly}} {{regarded}} global climate change research program. Based in West Glacier, with the main headquarters in Bozeman, Montana, the U.S. Geological Survey has performed scientific research on specific climate change studies since 1992. In addition {{to the study of}} the retreating glaciers, research performed includes forest modeling studies in which fire ecology and habitat alterations are analyzed. Additionally, changes in alpine vegetation patterns are documented, watershed studies in which stream flow rates and temperatures are recorded frequently at fixed <b>gauging</b> stations, and atmospheric research in which UV-B radiation, ozone and other atmospheric gases are analyzed over time. The research compiled contributes to a broader understanding of climate changes in the park. The data collected, when compared to other facilities scattered around the world, help to correlate these climatic changes on a global scale.|$|E
5|$|The {{advent of}} railroads {{in the late}} 19th century led to further {{development}} in the watershed of Darby Creek. Stops along the Pennsylvania Railroad such as Darby, Prospect Park, and Ridley Park increased in population greatly. Concern {{for the health of}} the creek led Lansdowne residents to raise funds to preserve a stretch of the creek in 1910. In the early 1900s, the major industries in the watershed of Darby Creek included agriculture. However, in modern times, agriculture is only done in a few small areas in the watershed's upper reaches. During this time period, railroads such as the Pennsylvania Railroad, the Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington Railroad, and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad crossed the watershed. A <b>gauging</b> station was established on the creek at Landsowne in 1911.|$|E

40|$|Abstract] A supersymmetric {{model with}} U(1) <b>gauge</b> {{symmetry}} {{will be discussed}} in this paper. The model has strict U(1) <b>gauge</b> symmetry and supersymmetry simultaneously. Besides, there is a massive U(1) <b>gauge</b> field contained in the model. According to the conventional notion, if a system has strict <b>gauge</b> symmetry, the mass of <b>gauge</b> field in the lagrangian must be zero [1]. With the development of the <b>gauge</b> theory, this notion has already been changed. In the <b>gauge</b> theory developed by Wu [2], under the precondition that the system has strict <b>gauge</b> symmetry, the theory contains massive <b>gauge</b> bosons. In fact, this result holds not only in the usual quantum field theory, but also in the supersymmetric quantum field theory. In other words, we could construct a supersymmetric <b>gauge</b> field model with massive <b>gauge</b> bosons. Supersymmetric <b>gauge</b> field models have been extensively discussed in the literature [3 - 5]. Similar to the conventional <b>gauge</b> model, in all these supersymmetric <b>gauge</b> models, the masses of <b>gauge</b> fields is zero. In this paper, we will construct a <b>gauge</b> field model which has strict U(1) <b>gauge</b> symmetry, supersymmetry and one massive <b>gauge</b> field...|$|R
5|$|The river {{flows through}} the South Downs National Park, and is a {{designated}} Site of Nature Conservation Importance, in recognition of its value for wildlife. It supports {{a wide range of}} fish, and its upper reaches are the only location in Sussex where native white clawed crayfish can be found. The quality of the water is generally good, and the river is measured at four <b>gauging</b> stations, three on the main channel, and one of the River Lod, just before its junction with the Rother. Water from the underlying Lower Greensand aquifer and the adjacent chalk aquifer helps to maintain the flows during the summer months, despite the fact that large volumes are abstracted from both the aquifers and the river for the public water supply.|$|E
5|$|A dam on Nescopeck Creek was {{destroyed}} during Hurricane Agnes in 1972. In the early 1900s, {{there was a}} steam-electric power station {{at the mouth of}} Nescopeck Creek. The Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railway passed over Nescopeck Creek {{in the beginning of the}} 1900s. The Jeddo Tunnel, which drained a colliery in the 20th century, emptied into Nescopeck Creek. After World War II, there was a large increase in unemployment rates in the Nescopeck Creek watershed due to the failing coal mining industry. From 1919 to 1926, the United States Geological Survey had a station on Nescopeck Creek near the community of St. Johns. Two other stream <b>gauging</b> stations have been built on Nescopeck Creek. One of these stations, which was in use from 1949 to 1950 was in Nescopeck. The other, which was in use from 1963 to 1970, was 0.6 miles upstream of Nescopeck Creek's mouth. In the 1990s, some people were caught stealing Native American artifacts at the Nescopeck Creek headwaters.|$|E
5|$|In West Virginia, 27river <b>gauging</b> {{stations}} were 1 in 100year events, mostly along the Potomac and Monongahela basins. As most of West Virginia's liveable land is along flood plains, the river flooding caused heavy {{damage in the}} state, mostly in the eastern portion. High waters washed away topsoil and thousands of trees, and over 13,000homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed in the state. Damage was estimated at nearly $700million, making it West Virginia's costliest flood, and there were 38deaths. Flooding also affected Maryland, although {{to a lesser degree}} than neighboring Virginia, with $21million in damage and one death. There was also tidal flooding in the state along the Chesapeake Bay from the storm, which washed away beaches just weeks after Hurricane Gloria affected the coastline. In Pennsylvania, flooding was worst along the Monongahela River in the state's southwest portion. During the storm, a power company opened the flood gates of the Lake Lynn dam along the river to preserve its integrity, triggering a class action lawsuit that ultimately failed. The floods damaged or destroyed 3,349houses in Pennsylvania, causing $83million in damage, as well as one death.|$|E
