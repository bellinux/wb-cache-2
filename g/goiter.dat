5|$|Iodine {{deficiency}} is {{the most}} common cause of primary hypothyroidism and endemic <b>goiter</b> worldwide. In areas of the world with sufficient dietary iodine, hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic autoimmune thyroiditis). Hashimoto's may be associated with a <b>goiter.</b> It is characterized by infiltration of the thyroid gland with T lymphocytes and autoantibodies against specific thyroid antigens such as thyroid peroxidase, thyroglobulin and the TSH receptor.|$|E

5|$|Newborn {{children}} with hypothyroidism may have normal birth weight and height (although the head may {{be larger than}} expected and the posterior fontanelle may be open). Some may have drowsiness, decreased muscle tone, a hoarse-sounding cry, feeding difficulties, constipation, an enlarged tongue, umbilical hernia, dry skin, a decreased body temperature and jaundice. A <b>goiter</b> is rare, although it may develop later in children who have a thyroid gland that does not produce functioning thyroid hormone. A <b>goiter</b> may also develop in children growing up in areas with iodine deficiency. Normal growth and development may be delayed, and not treating infants may lead to an intellectual impairment (IQ 6–15 points lower in severe cases). Other problems include the following: large scale and fine motor skills and coordination, reduced muscle tone, squinting, decreased attention span, and delayed speaking. Tooth eruption may be delayed.|$|E
5|$|People with {{hypothyroidism}} {{often have}} no or only mild symptoms. Numerous symptoms and signs {{are associated with}} hypothyroidism, and {{can be related to}} the underlying cause, or a direct effect of having not enough thyroid hormones.

5|$|The {{most common}} {{underlying}} form of thyroid disease associated with TPP is Graves' disease, a syndrome {{due to an}} autoimmune reaction that leads to overproduction of thyroid hormone.

40|$|Abstract: Background. Our {{objective}} was to evaluate mor-bidity and mortality of thyroidectomy in substernal <b>goiters</b> and identify patients at risk for these events. Methods. The medical records of 127 patients with sub-sternal <b>goiters</b> were retrospectively reviewed. Results. The most common preoperative symptom was shortness of breath (48 %). 13 % of the 127 patients were asymptomatic. Preoperative imaging identified tracheal devia-tion in 69 % and tracheal compression in 41 % of the cases. Substernal <b>goiters</b> were resected via a cervical approach in 100 % of the cases. Six patients (5 %) had postoperative hoarseness, 1 had permanent vocal cord paralysis, and 19 (15 %) had transient postoperative hypocalcemia. The mortality and permanent hypoparathyroidism were null. Patients with postoperative complications had larger <b>goiters</b> {{and were more likely}} to have tracheal compression. Conclusions. Thyroid resection via a cervical approach for substernal <b>goiters</b> is associated with low rate of morbidity and no mortality. Patients with large tumors and tracheal compression are more likely to develop postoperativ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Clinical {{picture and}} {{surgical}} management of 175 mediastinal <b>goiters</b> {{are discussed in}} this retrospective study. Method: Between 1979 and 1996, 175 patients with intrathoracic <b>goiters</b> were operated on at the Thoracic Surgical Clinic in Budapest. The majority of the <b>goiters</b> were cervicomediastinal (n = 138, 79 %), past the level of aortic arch, {{and the others were}} complete aberrant lesions (n = 37, 21 %). Of the patients, 40 % (n = 70) were symptom-free, in the others the clinical picture was dominated by compressive symptoms, among them, in five instances, the initial false, long-lasting diagnosis was bronchial asthma and, in four cases, vena cava superior syndrome caused by advanced inoperable malignancy. Twenty-two percent of patients (n = 39) were operated on previously for cervical struma. Eleven percent (n = 19) of the patients had hyperthyroid symptoms. In 124 cases the <b>goiters</b> were located in the anterior mediastinum. The majority (n = 96) of cervicomediastinal <b>goiters</b> (n = 138) could be removed through a cervical access, in the others an additional sternotomy (n = 31), or anterior thoracotomy (n = 11) were necessary. For resection of complete intrathoracic <b>goiters</b> (n = 37) standard thoracotomy (n = 30) or median sternotomy (n = 7) were used guided by retrotracheal or substernal position. Results: Hospital mortality was 1. 1 %. Minor complications occurred in 46 cases (26 %) and laryngeal nerve palsy in 14 patients (8 %). Tracheomalatia developed in 18 patients (10 %) which were mainly solved by tracheal intubation for 4 – 6 days. Ninety-four percent (n = 165) of the lesions proved to be diffuse colloid or adenomatous <b>goiters</b> by histology and 10 were (mostly follicular type) carcinomas. Conclusions: Unrecognized mediastinal <b>goiters</b> can produce asthma like symptoms, which may lead to late or misdiagnosis and deficient treatment. Once the diagnosis and exac...|$|R

5|$|Thyroid hormones {{to treat}} goiters: In 239 BC, Master Lu's Spring and Autumn Annals stated that where water is too light, people suffer {{widespread}} baldness and <b>goiter.</b> It {{was not until}} the 1860 that French physician Gaspard Adolphe Chatin (1813–1901) linked <b>goiter</b> with the lack of iodine in soil and water; iodine was discovered in the thyroid gland in 1896 by German chemist Eugen Baumann, while thyroid extract was used to treat patients in 1890. The Tang Dynasty (618–907) physician Zhen Quan (d. 643 AD), in his Old and New Tried and Tested Prescriptions, stated that the thyroid glands taken from gelded rams were used to treat patients with goiter; the thyroid hormones could be swallowed in pill form (the body of the pill made from crushed jujube pulp) or as a solid thyroid gland with the fat taken off. The Pharmacopoeia of the Heavenly Husbandman asserted that iodine-rich sargassum was used to treat <b>goiter</b> by the 1st century BC (Ge Hong, 284–364, also suggested using a tincture derived from sargassum seaweed in about 340 AD), a treatment later recorded in the West by Italian practrica Roger of Palermo in his Practica Chirurgiae of 1180 AD.|$|E

Signs may include delayed relaxation of the ankle reflex and a slow heart beat. A <b>goiter</b> may be present with a completely enlarged thyroid gland; sometimes {{only part of the}} thyroid is enlarged and it can be knobby in character.|$|E

5|$|Worldwide {{about one}} billion people are {{estimated}} to be iodine deficient; however, it is unknown how often this results in hypothyroidism. In large population-based studies in Western countries with sufficient dietary iodine, 0.3–0.4% of the population have overt hypothyroidism. A larger proportion, 4.3–8.5%, have subclinical hypothyroidism. Of people with subclinical hypothyroidism, 80% have a TSH level below the 10mIU/l mark regarded as the threshold for treatment. Children with subclinical hypothyroidism often return to normal thyroid function, and a small proportion develops overt hypothyroidism (as predicted by evolving antibody and TSH levels, the presence of celiac disease, and the presence of a <b>goiter).</b>|$|E
5|$|The Chinese of the Tang era {{were also}} very {{interested}} in the benefits of officially classifying all of the medicines used in pharmacology. In 657, Emperor Gaozong of Tang (r. 649–683) commissioned the literary project of publishing an official materia medica, complete with text and illustrated drawings for 833 different medicinal substances taken from different stones, minerals, metals, plants, herbs, animals, vegetables, fruits, and cereal crops. In addition to compiling pharmacopeias, the Tang fostered learning in medicine by upholding imperial medical colleges, state examinations for doctors, and publishing forensic manuals for physicians. Authors of medicine in the Tang include Zhen Chuan (d. 643) and Sun Simiao (581–682), the former who first identified in writing that patients with diabetes had an excess of sugar in their urine, and the latter who was the first to recognize that diabetic patients should avoid consuming alcohol and starchy foods. As written by Zhen Chuan and others in the Tang, the thyroid glands of sheep and pigs were successfully used to treat goiters; thyroid extracts were not used to treat patients with <b>goiter</b> in the West until 1890. The use of the dental amalgam, manufactured from tin and silver, was first introduced in the medical text Xinxiu Bencao written by Su Gong in 659.|$|E
5|$|Hensley {{had five}} {{children}} {{with his second}} wife, Irene. She was from a prosperous Lutheran family of German descent but believed that she was suffering a curse. She and her family had hoped that Hensley could free her from the curse, but ultimately {{felt that he was}} unable to. The marriage was contentious because of Hensley's frequent unemployment and poor treatment of Irene. He found intermittent work, including bricklaying, but Irene's family had to help support them; her mother provided the family with clothing. After seven years of marriage, Irene left Hensley and returned to her family, although she returned to Hensley and reconciled with him. One of their sons recalled that Irene was much more religious than Hensley, whom he claims only spoke about spiritual matters if there were church leaders present. Hensley was again separated from Irene around 1941. The cause of the estrangement is unknown, although one of their sons claimed that she threatened to have him arrested. She reconciled with him after he promised to find steady employment, and they returned to Pineville with their children. Hensley wanted to put their children in an orphanage so Irene could travel with him, but she refused. After a visit from her sister, Irene again left him; she and her children went to live with Hensley's children from his first marriage. A divorce was granted in 1943. Irene later died of complications following surgery for <b>goiter.</b> Hensley attended the wake and visited his children, but departed without them and did not return.|$|E

25|$|The <b>goiter</b> in Graves' {{disease is}} often not nodular, but thyroid nodules are also common. Differentiating common forms of {{hyperthyroidism}} such as Graves' disease, single thyroid adenoma, and toxic multinodular <b>goiter</b> is important to determine proper treatment.

25|$|Through {{the thyroid}} clinic, Campos {{likewise}} pursued research on {{whether there was}} a genetic factor that contributed to endemic <b>goiter.</b> His findings, as contained in a paper that he published in 1961, proposed that the iodine intake deficiency thought to be the main cause of <b>goiter</b> {{was just one of the}} triggering factors of the disease, and that physiology and anatomy proved to be more important considerations as some people were born without the enzyme necessary to take in trace elements such as iodine even if it were present in food and water.|$|E

40|$|<b>Goiters</b> are {{classified}} into: the cervical, retrosternal, substernal and intrathoracic. The aim {{of research is}} to analysis of intrathoracic <b>goiters</b> (ITG) which include <b>goiters</b> with more than 80 % of tissue in the thoracic cavity and intrathoracic thyroid choristomas. Methods: In prospective non-randomized study were analyzed 21 consecutive patients operated on for intrathoracic non-toxic benign <b>goiters</b> from 1987 - 98. Fourteen patients with intrathoracic <b>goiters</b> (more than 80 % of tissue in the thoracic cavity) and seven patients with intratoracic choristomas were operated. Two groups of ITG were observed according to the expressed symptomatology and surgical approach and complications of operative treatment were compared to the complications of operative treatment of 986 non-ITG non-toxic benign <b>goiters.</b> Results: ITG represented 1, 1 % of the whole number of operatively treated thyroid diseases. One third of patients were asymptomatic. Commonly observed symptoms were dispnea, stridor and dysphagia {{and there was no}} significant difference in appearance of these symptoms between the two groups of ITG. In 19 % of patients correct preoperative diagnosis wasn't assessed. Cervical approach with sternothomy was used in 11 patients, cervical approach with right thoracotomy in seven, right thoracotomy only in two, and cervical approach only in one patient. Thoracic approach was used in 95 % of cases and {{there was no significant difference}} between the two groups of ITG. Concerning the operative complications, in two patients transient vocal cord paresis and in one patient postoperative bleeding were verified. There was no statistically significant deference in frequency of operative complications between ITG and non-ITG. Conclusions: ITG are rare, but might present a difficult diagnostic and complex surgical problem. Common clinical presentation and identical surgical approach in operative treatment justify the common review of the two groups of intrathoracic <b>goiters.</b> With adequate and timely performed surgical approach, in specialized institutions, frequency of complications in operative treatment of ITG is not higher if compared to operative treatment of non-ITG...|$|R
