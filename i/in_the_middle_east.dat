5|$|In {{the second}} half of 1941, the Australian ICorps was {{concentrated}} in Syria and Lebanon to rebuild its strength and prepare for further operations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East.</b> Following the outbreak of war in the Pacific most elements of the Corps, including the 6th and 7th Divisions, returned to Australia in early 1942 to counter the perceived Japanese threat to Australia. The Australian Government agreed to British and United States requests to temporarily retain the 9th Division <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> in exchange for the deployment of additional US troops to Australia and Britain's support for a proposal to expand the RAAF to 73squadrons.
