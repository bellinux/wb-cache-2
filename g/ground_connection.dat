5|$|Those {{accustomed}} to making repairs on solid state equipment are cautioned that vacuum tube gear contain potentially lethal voltages. The practice of discharging power-supply capacitors and keeping one hand {{in your pocket}} when working on powered-up gear are essential safety measures. Some older equipment directly connects the metal chassis {{to one side of}} the incoming AC line, a practice which results in the entire unit becoming electrified if the wall plug is inserted backwards. Many older radios, such as vintage receivers, are not safety-fused. Restorers generally replace the AC line cord with a more modern 3 wire plug and install an in-line or chassis mount fuseholder. The use of a common station <b>ground</b> <b>connection</b> to all equipment is encouraged. Those who collect, restore or otherwise use vintage radio equipment should also be aware of possible radioactive substances.|$|E

25|$|The female XLR {{connectors}} {{are designed}} to first connect pin 1 (the earth pin), before the other pins make contact, when a male XLR connector is inserted. With the <b>ground</b> <b>connection</b> established before the signal lines are connected, the insertion (and removal) of XLR connectors in live equipment is possible without picking up external signals (as usually happens with, for example, RCA connectors).|$|E

25|$|Electrical power {{distribution}} systems are often connected to ground {{to limit the}} voltage that can appear on distribution circuits. A distribution system insulated from ground may attain a high potential due to transient voltages caused by arcing, static electricity, or accidental contact with higher potential circuits. A <b>ground</b> <b>connection</b> of the system dissipates such potentials and limits the rise in voltage of the grounded system.|$|E
25|$|Israel's {{military}} {{options were}} pondered by its leadership {{during the second}} truce, and the Bernadotte Plan prompted the government and army to decide to concentrate the next effort on the southern front. The Operation, codenamed The Ten Plagues, was meant to open a permanent <b>ground</b> <b>connection</b> to the Negev, and gradually encircle the Egyptian forces in the Majdal – Bayt Jibrin corridor by creating wedges that would deny the Egyptians free movements between their main troop concentrations. This was the approach favored by Yigal Allon, head of the Southern Command, which mostly won over the General Staff's proposals to directly assault the large Egyptian concentrations.|$|E
25|$|Long-distance {{electromagnetic}} telegraph {{systems from}} 1820 onwards used {{two or more}} wires to carry the signal and return currents. It was then discovered, probably by the German scientist Carl August Steinheil in 1836–1837, that the ground {{could be used as}} the return path to complete the circuit, making the return wire unnecessary. However, there were problems with this system, exemplified by the transcontinental telegraph line constructed in 1861 by the Western Union Company between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California. During dry weather, the <b>ground</b> <b>connection</b> often developed a high resistance, requiring water to be poured on the ground rod to enable the telegraph to work or phones to ring.|$|E

25|$|Lightning {{protection}} for aircraft {{is provided by}} mounting devices on the aircraft structure. The protectors are provided with extensions through {{the structure of the}} aircraft's outer surface and within a static discharger. Protection systems for use in aircraft must protect critical and non-critical electronic equipment. Aircraft lightning protection provides an electrical path having a plurality of conductive segments, continuous or discontinuous, that upon exposure to a high voltage field form an ionization channel due to the system's breakdown voltage. Various lightning protection systems must reject the surge currents associated with the lightning strikes. Lightning protection means for aircraft include components which are dielectrics and metallic layers applied to the ordinarily lightning-accessible surfaces of composite structures. Various <b>ground</b> <b>connection</b> means to the layers comprises a section of wire mesh fusing the various layers to an attachment connecting the structure to an adjacent ground structure. Composite-to-metal or composite-to-composite structural joints are protected by making the interface areas conductive for transfer of lightning current.|$|E
25|$|Is {{the main}} {{amplifier}} block also a two-port? The main amplifier {{is shown in}} the upper shaded box. The ground connections are labeled. Figure 7 shows the interesting fact that the main amplifier does not satisfy the port conditions at its input and output unless the ground connections are chosen to make that happen. For example, on the input side, the current entering the main amplifier is IS. This current is divided three ways: to the feedback network, to the bias resistor RB and to the base resistance of the input transistor rπ. To satisfy the port condition for the main amplifier, all three components must be returned to the input side of the main amplifier, which means all the ground leads labeled G1 must be connected, as well as emitter lead GE1. Likewise, on the output side, all ground connections G2 must be connected and also <b>ground</b> <b>connection</b> GE2. Then, {{at the bottom of the}} schematic, underneath the feedback two-port and outside the amplifier blocks, G1 is connected to G2. That forces the ground currents to divide between the input and output sides as planned. Notice that this connection arrangement splits the emitter of the input transistor into a base-side and a collector-side – a physically impossible thing to do, but electrically the circuit sees all the ground connections as one node, so this fiction is permitted.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A slot placed {{between the}} feed and the <b>ground</b> <b>connections</b> {{of a single}} shorted {{microstrip}} antenna (PIFA) in a two antenna system can produce a band-stop filter effect {{in one of the}} frequency bands where both antennas radiate at the same frequency, but have very high isolation.

This paper analyzes methods to tune the band-stop filter effect by adjusting the slot width and additional <b>ground</b> <b>connections.</b> The antenna geometry analyzed is similar to a two antenna system inside a mobile device where the first antenna with slots has both lower band and high band resonances (quad-band GSM or dual-band LTE) and the second antenna is a wide-band single frequency antenna at LTE/ 3 G/WiMAX.

2500|$|The Electrical Safety Foundation International has stated: [...] "Never {{remove the}} ground pin (the third prong) {{to make a}} three-prong plug fit a two-prong outlet."

2500|$|The wire antennas {{used with}} crystal {{receivers}} are monopole antennas which develop their output voltage {{with respect to}} ground. The receiver thus requires a connection to ground (the earth) as a return circuit for the current. [...] The ground wire was attached to a radiator, water pipe, or a metal stake driven into the ground. [...] In early days if an adequate <b>ground</b> <b>connection</b> could not be made a counterpoise was sometimes used. [...] A good ground is more important for crystal sets {{than it is for}} powered receivers, as crystal sets are designed to have a low input impedance needed to transfer power efficiently from the antenna. A low resistance <b>ground</b> <b>connection</b> (preferably below 25 Ω) is necessary because any resistance in the ground reduces available power from the antenna. In contrast, modern receivers are voltage-driven devices, with high input impedance, hence little current flows in the antenna/ground circuit. Also, mains powered receivers are grounded adequately through their power cords, which are in turn attached to the earth by way of a well established ground.|$|E
2500|$|For {{measurement}} purposes, the Earth {{serves as}} a (reasonably) constant potential reference against which other potentials can be measured. An electrical ground system should have an appropriate current-carrying capability {{to serve as an}} adequate zero-voltage reference level. In electronic circuit theory, a [...] "ground" [...] is usually idealized as an infinite source or sink for charge, which can absorb an unlimited amount of current without changing its potential. Where a real <b>ground</b> <b>connection</b> has a significant resistance, the approximation of zero potential is no longer valid. Stray voltages or earth potential rise effects will occur, which may create noise in signals or if large enough will produce an electric shock hazard.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{hand-held}} and bench oscilloscopes {{have the}} ground reference voltage {{common to all}} input channels. If more than one measurement channel is used at the same time, all the input signals must have the same voltage reference, and the shared default reference is the [...] "earth". If there is no differential preamplifier or external signal isolator, this traditional desktop oscilloscope is not suitable for floating measurements. (Occasionally an oscilloscope user will break the ground pin in the power supply cord of a bench-top oscilloscope {{in an attempt to}} isolate the signal common from the earth ground. [...] This practice is unreliable since the entire stray capacitance of the instrument cabinet will be connected into the circuit. [...] Since it is also a hazard to break a safety <b>ground</b> <b>connection,</b> instruction manuals strongly advise against this practice.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{television}} stations, recording studios, {{and other}} installations where signal quality is critical, a special signal ground {{known as a}} [...] "technical ground" [...] (or [...] "technical earth", [...] "special earth", and [...] "audio earth") is often installed, to prevent ground loops. This is basically {{the same thing as}} an AC power ground, but no general appliance ground wires are allowed any connection to it, as they may carry electrical interference. For example, only audio equipment is connected to the technical ground in a recording studio. In most cases, the studio's metal equipment racks are all joined together with heavy copper cables (or flattened copper tubing or busbars) and similar connections are made to the technical ground. Great care is taken that no general chassis grounded appliances are placed on the racks, as a single AC <b>ground</b> <b>connection</b> to the technical ground will destroy its effectiveness. For particularly demanding applications, the main technical ground may consist of a heavy copper pipe, if necessary fitted by drilling through several concrete floors, such that all technical grounds may be connected by the shortest possible path to a grounding rod in the basement.|$|E
