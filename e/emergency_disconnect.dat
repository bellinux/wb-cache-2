The EDP is designed for use in an emergency, when the MODU or WIV needs to quickly disconnect, and move away from the oil/gas well that it is drilling or working-over. Examples of when this might be necessary include unexpected extreme weather that exceeds the MODU/Vessel's capability to maintain its position.|$|E
50|$|Pre-charging is {{commonly}} used in battery electric vehicle applications. The current to the motor is regulated by a controller that employs large capacitors in its input circuit. Such systems typically have contactors (a high-current relay) to disable the system during inactive periods and {{to act as an}} <b>emergency</b> <b>disconnect</b> should the motor current regulator fail in an active state. Without pre-charge the high voltage across the contactors and inrush current can cause a brief arc which will cause pitting of the contacts. Pre-charging the controller input capacitors (typically to 90 to 95 percent of applied battery voltage) eliminates the pitting problem. The current to maintain the charge is so low that some systems apply the pre-charge at all times other than when charging batteries, while more complex systems apply pre-charge as part of the starting sequence and will defer main contactor closure until the pre-charge voltage level is detected as sufficiently high.|$|E

30|$|Loss of {{position}} of the dynamically positioned rig without safe disconnection could result in critical damage to the well barrier, {{as well as to}} exposed subsea equipment. The ultimate consequence could be a blowout and/or severe damage to subsea production systems like production templates, resulting in risk to personnel, environmental damage, financial loss and harm to the reputation of the company (Paula and Fonseca 2013). Currently, all dynamically positioned rigs are equipped with an <b>emergency</b> <b>disconnect</b> button which initiates a pre-programmed sequence of functions designed to secure the well in a minimal amount of time prior to disconnecting the LMRP riser connector (Sattler and Lewis 2004). An <b>emergency</b> <b>disconnect</b> sequence (EDS) is a sequence of actions, events and interlocks that are automatically initiated once the EDS button is pressed on any BOP panel in the rig.

30|$|To {{investigate}} what {{is known}} on the subject, {{it was necessary to}} see what is already available in the literature. Thus, a bibliographic search was conducted from 1980 to October 4, 2015, taking as reference the SCOPUS database, which is significant in several fields of knowledge. Initially, the key words used were: “emergency disconnect sequence” or “system of <b>emergency</b> <b>disconnect</b> sequence” or “emergency disconnection” or “disconnection emergency guidelines” or “system of emergency disconnection.” The 113 results were found with articles and conference papers, considering only the “physical sciences” category. A new filter was applied, where the “computer science,” “earth and planetary sciences,” “physics and astronomy,” “social sciences,” “materials science,” “mathematics,” “medicine” and “environmental science” areas were removed, {{due to the fact that}} the subject is specific to the oil and gas industry. Using this filter, it was possible to obtain 69 documents. In a more detailed analysis of these articles, 21 documents were then selected to form the core of the bibliographic research. It is concluded that the subject presented here is innovative, very current and it is still developing.|$|E
40|$|Drilling of {{petroleum}} wells have traditionally {{be done by}} adjusting the mud weight to balance pressure of the well. A new method of controlling well pressure is called controlled mud cap drilling. The method uses high mud weight and constantly changing the mud height to adjust the bottom hole pressure. This allows for drilling wells which previously were considered un-drillable. Drilling of wells might be done by a floating drilling vessel, which might drift off. In such cases an <b>emergency</b> <b>disconnect</b> of riser may be unavoidable. Hence the riser must be disconnected. The top tension is set high enough to lift the riser and LMRP clear of the BOP with a set mud height. This top tension creates recoil in the riser. During drilling the mud height changes constantly while the top tension remains constant. In essence the top tension is relatively large if disconnecting with low mud level, hence recoil would be larger. In order to look into this issue of riser response with different mud heights a model {{has been established in}} Riflex. This has been modeled with weight on an accurate modeling of the riser and heave compensation system while the LMRP has been simplified. The mud in the riser has been modeled with three different mud heights, 80 m, 150 m and 200 m above the seabed. During disconnect the mud can either stay in the riser (annular preventer closed) or it can fall out (open annular preventer), both of these cases have been modeled. The drilling vessel is usually not positioned directly above the BOP when an <b>emergency</b> <b>disconnect</b> is implemented. Therefore a horizontal offset of 5 % of water depth was set. The study case is the Åsgard field on Norwegian Continental Shelf which has a water depth of 350 meters, hence the offset is set to be 17. 5 meters. There will be an unbalance in forces at the moment the riser disconnects. A tension wave and a mud pressure wave will travel up the riser. These waves travel up the riser induces an upward motion on the riser and a fall in axial stress. The magnitude of the fall in axial stress is highly dependent on the mud height at the moment of release. The drop in axial is greater for low mud heights and decreasing with increasing mud height. The fall might be so large that compression of the riser can occur. The risk of compression is greatest {{at the bottom of the}} riser. Maximum bending stresses as a response to disconnect may not be at the moment of release. There might be a delay in the maximum response. These bending stresses are not large enough in themselves to impose any structural issues on the riser. There will be no issues unless a peak value in bending stresses and a fall in axial stresses coincide. This might occur at the bottom of the riser. For low mud levels the riser might experience axial compression combined with relatively high bending stresses. This combination may result in local buckling, however, this is subject for further work. The responses are in general slightly larger when the drilling vessel has no offset. In order to avoid extreme response of the riser it is advisable to increase the amount of mud. It may be useful to determine an optimal mud level where the responses to release are low. A part of the <b>emergency</b> <b>disconnect</b> sequence might be to fill the riser either with water or mud in order to come close to the optimal release mud height before release. It is very important that the mud level is low enough too able the riser to lift clear the BOP. It is more expectable to have damage to the riser or drilling vessel compared to the BOP. </p...|$|E
30|$|In the literature, {{important}} {{works are}} {{found on the}} construction of offshore wells, using risk analysis techniques, such as Bayesian network, fault tree, event tree and bow tie (Bhandari et al. 2015; Khakzad et al. 2013; Abimbola et al. 2014). Such studies help to determine the probability of blowouts, facilitating the preventive and mitigating actions for undesired events. Also described in the literature is the impact on the operation risk by the introduction of new drilling techniques, such as MPD (managed pressure drilling) and UBD (underbalanced drilling) (Abimbola et al. 2015). Although there were interesting assessments on the probabilities of failure of several basic events in offshore well construction operations (Abimbola et al. 2014; OREDA 2002), no studies were found in the literature that included the selection of the closure sequence (EDS) of the BOP stack rams, in <b>emergency</b> <b>disconnect</b> events, in case of BOP closing failure. Incorrect selection of the closing sequence can lead to the events of blind rams, which do not have the cutting and well sealing capacity acting on pipes, severely increasing the probability of failure of the blind ram.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} avoid {{mistakes}} and to save {{a great deal of}} time in analysis, an innovative methodology was developed that can analyze the well operations and rig characteristics involved to define the best <b>emergency</b> <b>disconnect</b> sequence (EDS) available. A solution was developed based on the characteristics of the rigs and blowout preventers (BOPs), and six variables were considered that directly affect the choice of EDS. All possible combinations of 64 scenarios were analyzed, and the priority of choice of the EDS was defined empirically. This paper presents an approach to EDS risk management and examples of exposure time (time without riser safety margin and shear capability) for the same well, which can be lowered from 13 % to 0.1 %. The impact of this reduction is related to the ability of the BOP to cut some of the heavy casings, in addition to improved availability of EDS modes. This implementation opened up many possibilities for the performance of risk exposure analysis, enabling comparison of several BOP configurations of contracted rigs and selection of the best options. This innovative approach allowed a better management of the rig schedules, prioritizing safety aspects and making it possible to allocate the fleet in a systematic way.|$|E

40|$|Ever {{since the}} first oil was {{discovered}} in Norway in 1971 the production rates have varied. The development has gone from few wells with high production rates to several wells with lower production rates. It is expected that the production rate will continue to decrease in the future. Taking this into consideration, {{it is apparent that}} operations which will enhance the production rate are important. Workover operations are operations where the well is cleaned out, which enhances the production rate. Moreover, Workover operations are conducted with a Workover Riser Systems. The Workover riser system is a long slender structure stretching from the vessel down to the sea bed, which is exposed to loads from the environment and the platform. If a storm is coming and the operational limits are expected to be exceeded, the system has to perform a planned/normal disconnection. The disconnection takes place between the <b>Emergency</b> <b>Disconnect</b> Package (EDP) and the Lower Riser Package (LRP). This is done to prevent damage to the components, especially the well head. The criteria for conducting disconnection are defined in the operation envelopes. When a planned/normal disconnection is performed there are some critical scenarios that should be avoided. On such scenario is collision between the EDP and the remaining structure at the sea bed, the LRP. The scope of this Master Thesis is to study this event, collision between these two components. The purpose is to study the risk of contact between the <b>Emergency</b> <b>Disconnect</b> Package and the Lower Riser Package and propose a strategy for reducing it. To study the collision event the computer program RIFLEX has been applied. Two different models have been developed, both are based on the model applied in the Project Thesis. One model on - 348 m water depth and one model on - 996 m water depth. Several analyses and disconnection events have been conducted. The first set of analysis conducted is the different disconnection events. These events are disconnection at heave displacement top, heave displacement bottom, half way up the heave displacement (max velocity) and a random in time. The vertical displacement of the EDP after disconnection is studied. Additionally, a mean study has been performed {{in order to determine the}} trend for the vertical displacement after disconnect. Based on the different disconnection events, a probability study has been performed to study the frequency of hits. To enable for the probability study a MATLAB script has been developed. This checks if the EDP is within the limits of the LRP. Moreover, a correlation study has been performed. This has been done to determine if there exists a relation between the vertical velocity 30 seconds in advance of disconnection and at the actual disconnection timing. The reason for studying a 30 seconds time interval is because this is the time it takes for the electrical signal to be sent from the platform down to EDP. Finally, the last set of analyses which have been completed is disconnection analyses with riser lift up. When the disconnection is done the riser is lifted up 2 - 4 meters. A set of random disconnection events with retraction for both the shallow and deep water model has been conducted. The results from the different disconnection events show that when the disconnection is performed at the heave displacement top, the EDP will experience a negative vertical displacement immediately after disconnection. Simultaneously as the EDP is disconnected the riser is locked to the vessel at the top. For disconnection at heave displacement top it is locked at a higher location in the riser, this leads to a longer effective length of the riser underneath the vessel. Thus, the mean vertical displacement is below the location of the LRP. The results from the mean study show that the trend is an immediate negative displacement after disconnect. Additionally, the probability study shows that disconnection at the heave displacement top, has the highest mean percent of time when the EDP is within the LRP limits. On the other hand, the results from disconnection at the heave displacement bottom show that the EDP will have displacement in positive z-direction, and the mean vertical displacement is above the location of the LRP. The mean percentage of time the EDP is within the limits of the LRP, is zero. When the disconnection is performed in the middle of the heave displacement, the average value of the mean vertical displacement lies at the initial position of the EDP. The mean percent of time the EDP is within the LRP limits is the second lowest. The results from the random disconnection show that the mean percent of time the EDP is within the limits of the LRP, is the second highest. Therefore it can be concluded that the most critical disconnection is the disconnection at the heave displacement top. The second most critical is the random disconnection. However, to avoid collision the most optimal disconnection event is disconnection at the heave displacement bottom. Finally, riser disconnection analyses with a 0 - 4 meter lift-up have been performed for the deep and shallow water model. Before the disconnection is performed the riser is retracted 2 - 4 meters to avoid collision. The results from these analyses show that when the riser is lifted up either two or four meters there is a significant clearance between the EDP and LRP. However, the analysis was also done with zero and one meter retraction, which illustrated that the number of hits is lower for the deep water model than the shallow water model. This may have to do with the length of the riser that is exposed to the current. The deep water model will therefore have a bigger horizontal displacement. From these results it can be concluded that if the riser is lifted up a minimum of two meters, it is likely that the EDP will never collide with the LRP...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyThe push in the {{industry}} towards increasing the weather window for marine operations offshore leads to a focus on new technology. When performing workover operations in a subsea well, the workover riser is a physical connection between the well and the floating workover vessel. A floating vessel will experience wave induced motion and is therefore equipped with a heave compensator to allow for this relative motion without increasing the load to the riser. If the heave compensator fails or if the heave of the vessel exceeds the stroke length of the heave compensator, the workover riser can be subjected to an excessive axial force that could rupture the riser and damage subsea well barriers. A safety joint {{that is to be}} installed in the riser can improve the window for safe operation while reducing consequences if an accident were to occur. It is called the Telescopic Safety Joint (TSJ) and has been developed by FMC Technologies. The joint is designed to telescope when subjected to a predetermined axial force. The telescoping function of the joint will ensure that there is sufficient time for personnel onboard the vessel to activate the <b>emergency</b> <b>disconnect</b> function so that the riser can safely be disconnected from the well. The safety joint is a weak link. During installation of the workover system, the riser experiences loading conditions exceeding that of normal operation. There is a concern that the safety joint may take plastic damage during this installation. Hence the TSJ is equipped with an over-ride function that temporarily can increase the strength of the joint. The over-ride function works by pumping hydraulic pressure into external cylinders. The increase in the strength of the joint from the over-ride function depends upon the hydraulic pressure. This thesis studies the effect the over-ride function has on the weather window for installation of a workover system, comparing a fully pressurized over-ride function to a semi-pressurized over-ride function. Simulations in Orcaflex for various environmental conditions found the loads that the TSJ must be able to withstand for installation to be possible. A model of the joint was created in AUTODESK Inventor. Using ANSYS workbench, the model was tested to find out which loads that are acceptable and which loads leads to plastic damage of the joint both for the fully pressurized and semi-pressurized over-ride function. Combining the results for the fully- and semi-pressurized over-ride function test, with the results from the dynamic simulations performed in Orcaflex revealed an increase in installation window when using the fully pressurized over-ride function. The joint using the full capacity of the over-ride function was able to withstand 620 kNm before plastic damage took place. The joint using a semi-pressurized over-ride function began taking plastic damage at 400 kNm. The over-ride function increases the bending moment capacity of the joint by 55 %. Using the scatter diagram for the Draugen field to see how many observations has been made of the different sea states, the increased availability for installation when using the full capacity of the over-ride function, as opposed to the semi-pressurized joint was calculated. When installing the TSJ as the 2 nd riser joint, the availability increased by 21, 7 %. Installing the TSJ as the 3 rd joint increases the availability by 16, 7 %. Installation of the TSJ on the 4 th and 5 th joint gives an increase of respectively 2, 8 % and 0, 3 % when the full over-ride capacity is used. The over-ride functions proved to be so effective that the joint became stronger than the actual workover riser. Hand calculations showed that the riser would yield before the safety joint and thus the safety joint would not be a limiting factor for the workover installation activity if the over-ride function is active...|$|E
