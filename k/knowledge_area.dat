The purpose of this research was to investigate the effectiveness of post-secondary accounting programs in preparing individuals for a public accounting auditing career. Audit seniors and audit managers were surveyed to utilize their experience in supervising first- and fifth-year auditors. The eight <b>knowledge</b> <b>areas</b> included in the study were auditing, business environment, business operations, decision techniques, ethics, financial accounting, managerial accounting, and tax. The eight skills included in the study were accounting and auditing evaluation, business, computer, ethical reasoning, interpersonal, learning, oral communication, and written communication. A questionnaire was developed to obtain the perceptions of respondents concerning the relative importance of the <b>knowledge</b> <b>areas</b> and skills, the relative importance of <b>knowledge</b> <b>areas</b> compared with skills, and the preparation level of first- and fifth-year auditors in each of the <b>knowledge</b> <b>areas</b> and skills. Questionnaires were distributed to 144 audit seniors and 137 audit managers employed by a big-six CPA firm. The audit seniors and audit managers were assigned to one of the ten offices selected for distribution to minimize possible regional biases. Useable responses were received from 89 audit seniors (61. 8 %) and 62 (45. 3 %) audit managers. A specific importance hierarchy for the <b>knowledge</b> <b>areas</b> and skills was not determinable; however, importance groupings were discernable. Three <b>knowledge</b> <b>areas</b> (auditing, managerial accounting, and ethics) and three skills (interpersonal, written communication, and ethical reasoning) were perceived to have the same relative importance for a successful first- and fifth-year of an auditing career. Overall, it was found that possession of the professional knowledge base and professional skill repertoire were equally important for a successful auditing career. Three <b>knowledge</b> <b>areas</b> were perceived to be adequately developed in both first- and fifth-year auditors, while five (six) skills were perceived to be adequately developed in first-year (fifth-year) auditors. The conclusions of the study were: (1) specific <b>knowledge</b> <b>areas</b> and skills are not equally important for a successful public accounting auditing career, (2) programs preparing individuals for an auditing career primarily need improvement in developing the business environment and business operations <b>knowledge</b> <b>areas,</b> and (3) auditors have a better developed skills repertoire than professional knowledge base...|$|R

40|$|The {{existing}} 			framework of Project Management advises {{project managers}} to exercise 			nine <b>knowledge</b> <b>areas.</b> These are {{management of the}} projects Scope, 			Time, Cost, Quality, HR, Communication, Procurement, Risk and 			Integration. It suggests entertaining these nine <b>knowledge</b> <b>areas</b> in 			five processes that are initiating, planning, executing, controlling 			and closing the project. The knowledge on HR Management (HRM) 			declares fourteen functions that this study identified applicable to 			Project Management. The literature stresses that managing all these 			<b>knowledge</b> <b>areas</b> determines projects outcome. The literature further 			indicates that nine <b>knowledge</b> <b>areas</b> are not equal in priority and 			HRM is not given the needful precedence. The study perceived that it 			is not pragmatic for a project manager to perform the nine <b>knowledge</b> 			<b>areas</b> and all the applicable functions of HRM efficiently 			From Jan 2005 to Jan 2008, this study discovered that in the IT 			industry of Islamabad Rawalpindi, Pakistan, project managers were 			assigned neither all the nine <b>knowledge</b> <b>areas</b> nor all the applicable 			functions of HRM. The study observed that projects suffered where 			HRM was underestimated. Can the quality in practice of HRM make or 			break projects? If yes, what minimum functions of HRM should be 			assigned to a project manager to benefit projects? Further, how can 			the project manager&s role for precise number of <b>knowledge</b> <b>areas</b> be 			defined? The study assumed that precise and well-defined role of a 			project manager {{in terms of the}} nine <b>knowledge</b> <b>areas</b> and HRM can 			make the existing framework for Project Management more adoptable. 			For this purpose integrating the literature and the real practices 			in the selected IT industry this study identified and selected five 			HRM functions as independent variables (IVs) keeping project result 			as dependent variable (DV). The IVs include selecting right person, 			assigning workload, setting timelines, communication and monitoring 			performance. This study hypothesized that the result of specific 			IT/Telecom project is correlated with and regressed by the quality 			in the practice of the mentioned HRM functions. 			Utilizing a valid and reliable instrument the study collected data 			for a stratified sample of 70 heterogeneous IT/Telecom projects from 			the selected 24 IT/Telecom organizations. Employing frequency 			descriptive statistics, Pearson& correlations, regression and PLS 			regression the analyses were conducted. All the selected IVs were 			found correlated with project result. Individually no IV regressed 			project result but collectively they all regressed the DV. The study 			substantiated its hypotheses based on results of regression and PLS 			regression. It inferred that good quality practice of all the 			selected HR functions paves success for IT/Telecom project while 			their substandard practice will lead project to suffering. The 			conclusion of the study is applicable on the IT projects of large 			scope and team size with well-defined type provided all the other 			<b>knowledge</b> <b>areas</b> for project management are exercised with necessary 			equilibrium. Based on results this study declares that a project 			manager should perform at least these five functions of HRM. The 			study designed templates to help project managers performing these 			HR functions. The mentioned results and findings from the IT 			industry about the <b>knowledge</b> <b>areas</b> enabled this study reshaping the 			existing framework for Project Management. It contributes that 			project manager better be set responsible only for the management of 			scope, time, cost, HR and communication for projects while quality, 			risk and procurement for projects better be managed at organization 			level.
