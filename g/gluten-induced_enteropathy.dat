40|$|<b>Gluten-induced</b> <b>enteropathy</b> or coeliac {{disease is}} a {{condition}} characterized by malabsorption {{and a variety of}} clinical manifestations. In adults, coeliac disease may be discovered while investigating iron-deficient anemia, bone pain or unexplained weight loss. We have recently diagnosed a case of <b>gluten-induced</b> <b>enteropathy</b> in an elderly woman whose symptoms were unusual. The patient had episodes of laryngospasm secondary to severe hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia. The malabsorption syndrome was responsible for low levels of vitamin D, causing the electrolytic imbalance. Laryngospasm is a rare symptom of hypocalcemia and has not, to our knowledge, been described in the context of coeliac disease...|$|E

40|$|SummaryCeliac sprue (also {{known as}} celiac disease) is an inheritable, <b>gluten-induced</b> <b>enteropathy</b> {{of the upper}} small {{intestine}} with an estimated prevalence of 0. 5 %– 1 % {{in most parts of}} the world. The ubiquitous nature of food gluten, coupled with inadequate labeling regulations in most countries, constantly poses a threat of disease exacerbation and relapse for patients. Here, we demonstrate that a two-enzyme cocktail comprised of a glutamine-specific cysteine protease (EP-B 2) that functions under gastric conditions and a PEP, which acts in concert with pancreatic proteases under duodenal conditions, is a particularly potent candidate for celiac sprue therapy. At a gluten:EP-B 2 :PEP weight ratio of 75 : 3 : 1, grocery store gluten is fully detoxified within 10 min of simulated duodenal conditions, as judged by chromatographic analysis, biopsy-derived T cell proliferation assays, and a commercial antigluten antibody test...|$|E
40|$|Thirty-two {{children}} with a past diagnosis of coeliac disease were reinvestigated by means of gluten challenge. They had received a gluten-free diet for a mean period of 6 - 5 years (range 0 - 25 - 11 - 0) before gluten challenge, and had {{a mean age of}} 9 - 9 years (range 3 - 0 - 15 - 3) at the onset of challenge. Small intestinal biopsies were performed before and after the gluten challenge (at least 10 g natural gluten per day for 3 months in the majority) and, as judged by light microscopy and morphometric techniques, coeliac disease was confirmed in 25 (78 %) of the 32 patients; challenge was continued in the remaining 7 for a total period of 2 years when biopsies were repeated in 6 children and all were normal. Serum and RBC folate, serum iron, Hb level, and clinical symptoms were unpredictable variables in identifying children who developed <b>gluten-induced</b> <b>enteropathies.</b> The social and emotional effects of gluten challenge are discussed. The results highlight the importance of gluten challenge and intestinal biopsy in the diagnosis of coeliac disease and strongly suggest that a normal biopsy after a 3 -month gluten challenge (as described above) excludes coeliac disease...|$|R
40|$|Celiac {{disease is}} a <b>gluten-induced</b> {{autoimmune}} <b>enteropathy</b> characterized {{by the presence of}} tissue tranglutaminase (tTG) autoantibodies. A disposable electrochemical immunosensor (EI) for the detection of IgA and IgG type anti-tTG autoantibodies in real patient’s samples is presented. Screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCE) nanostructurized with carbon nanotubes and gold nanoparticles were used as the transducer surface. This transducer exhibits the excellent characteristics of carbon–metal nanoparticle hybrid conjugation and led to the amplification of the immunological interaction. The immunosensing strategy consisted of the immobilization of tTG on the nanostructured electrode surface followed by the electrochemical detection of the autoantibodies present in the samples using an alkaline phosphatase (AP) labelled anti-human IgA or IgG antibody. The analytical signal was based on the anodic redissolution of enzymatically generated silver by cyclic voltammetry. The results obtained were corroborated with a commercial ELISA kit indicating that the electrochemical immunosensor is a trustful analytical screening tool...|$|R
40|$|Celiac {{disease is}} a <b>gluten-induced</b> {{autoimmune}} <b>enteropathy</b> characterized {{by the presence of}} antibodies against gliadin (AGA) and anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) autoantibodies.

A screen-printed carbon electrode with two working electrodes nanostructured with a carbon-metal hybrid system worked as the transducer surface. The immunosensing strategy consisted of the immobilization of gliadin and tTG (i. e.

40|$|Celiac disease (CD) is a <b>gluten-induced</b> <b>enteropathy,</b> {{which results}} from the interplay between {{environmental}} and genetic factors. There is a strong human leukocyte antigen (HLA) association with the disease, and HLA-DQ alleles represent a major genetic risk factor. In addition to HLA-DQ, non-HLA genes appear to be crucial for CD development. Chromosomal region 5 q 31 – 33 has demonstrated linkage with CD in several genome-wide studies, including in our Swedish/Norwegian cohort. In a European meta-analysis 5 q 31 – 33 was the only region that reached a genome-wide level of significance except for the HLA region. To identify the genetic variant(s) responsible for this linkage signal, we performed a comprehensive single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association screen in 97 Swedish/Norwegian multiplex families who demonstrate linkage to the region. We selected tag SNPs from a 16 Mb region representing the 95 % confidence interval of the linkage peak. A total of 1404 SNPs {{were used for the}} association analysis. We identified several regions with SNPs demonstrating moderate single- or multipoint associations. However, the isolated association signals appeared insufficient to account for the linkage signal seen in our cohort. Collective effects of multiple risk genes within the region, incomplete genetic coverage or effects related to copy number variation are possible explanations for our findings...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} 130 {{consecutive}} outpatients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis were screened at the oral medicine department, Glasgow Dental Hospital, for deficienciesin vitamin b 12, folic acid, and iron. In 23 patients (17. 7 %) such deficiencies werefound; five were deficient in vitamin B 12, seven in folic acid, and 15 in iron. Four {{had more than}} one deficiency. Out of 130 controls matched for age and sex 11 (8. 5 %) were found to have deficiencies. The 23 deficient patients with recurrent aphthaewere treated with specific replacement therapy, and all 130 patients were followed up for at least one year. Of the 23 patients on replacement therapy 15 showed complete remission of ulceration and eight definite improvement. Of the 107 patientswith no deficiency receiving local symptomatic treatment only 33 had a remission or wereimproved. This difference was significant (P less than 0. 001). Most patients withproved vitamin B 12 or folic acid deficiency improved rapidly on replacement therapy;those with iron deficiency showed a less dramatic response. The 23 deficient patientswere further investigated to determine the cause of their deficiencies and detect the presence of any associated conditions. Four were found to have Addisonian perniciousanaemia. Seven had a malabsorption syndrome, which in five proved to be a <b>gluten-induced</b> <b>enteropathy.</b> In addition, there were single patients with idiopathic proctocolitis, diverticular disease of the colon, regional enterocolitis, and adenocarcinoma of thecaecum. We suggest that the high incidence of deficiencies found in this series andthe good response to replacement therapy shows the need for haematological screening of such patients...|$|E
40|$|In­tro­duc­ti­on: Celiac disease (CD) is a <b>gluten-induced</b> <b>enteropathy</b> {{that results}} in {{malabsorption}} of nutrients such as selenium. A high incidence of malignancy in CD has been previously reported. Selenium {{is known to have}} a protective role against cancer. This study aimed to investigate whether there is an effect on serum selenium levels in children with CD on a gluten-free diet. Materials and Methods: Serum levels of selenium were studied in 17 children (mean age 5. 64 ± 3. 30 years) with CD and 20 age-and gender-matched healthy children. CD was diagnosed according to ESPGHAN criteria. All the patients were clinically well and had been on gluten-free diets for 11. 11 ± 1. 98 (mean±SE) months. All patients were fully consistent with the diet. The concentration of selenium was determined by a periodically validated atomic absorption spectrometer (Perkin Elmer AAS 700 system). Wet ashing procedure was used for all samples and controls. Results: In CD group one child’s (5. 8 %), and in control group three children’s (% 15) serum selenium levels were found under normal limits. There was no statistically significant difference between serum selenium levels and the duration of gluten free diet (p> 0. 05). There was no statistically significant difference in serum selenium levels between celiac patients (124. 19 ± 12. 31 µg/L) and control group (92. 47 ± 12. 06 µg/L), (p> 0. 05). Discussion: It can be concluded that, normal levels of serum selenium in children with CD can be achieved with fully compatible gluten-free diet and a balanced diet which supplies daily selenium requirement.

40|$|Coeliac disease (CD) is a <b>gluten-induced</b> {{autoimmune}} <b>enteropathy</b> {{found in}} genetically susceptible subjects. Because {{of the high}} number of undetected cases, rapid and cheaper screening methods are needed. Currently, the CD diagnosis involves the detection of anti-transglutaminase IgA antibodies (anti-tTG IgA) in blood serum through the use of ELISA systems with confirmation by histology of the intestinal mucosa. A new, rapid magneto-electrochemical immunosensor for CD diagnosis has been developed and applied to serum sample analysis. The system uses magnetic beads coated with tTG antigen to detect anti-tTG antibodies in positive serum samples and an alkaline phosphataseconjugated anti-human IgA as label. An electrochemical readout, using magnetized screen-printed electrodes coupled with a portable instrument, is made after the addition of α- naphtyl phosphate, which is enzymatically converted into the electrochemically active α-naphthol product. The work involved the following considerations: (1) optimization of analytical parameters; (2) recovery evaluation, adding known concentrations of anti-tTG IgA to “blank” sera; (3) analysis of 107 blood serum samples; (4) calculation of the ROC curve, resulting in a cut-off of 1. 0 U/ml, 100...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Celiac {{disease is}} a <b>gluten-induced</b> small bowel <b>enteropathy.</b> Inflammation {{is known to be}} {{associated}} with enhanced nitric oxide (NO) production. An increase in urinary nitrate and nitrite (NOx) reflects increased NO production. The urinary NOx:creatinine ratio can be used as an indicator of the endogenous NO production. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine whether the urinary NOx:creatinine ratio of celiac disease patients increases during gluten challenge. METHODS: The authors studied 20 patients with unconfirmed celiac disease who had been following a gluten-free diet for at least 1 year. These patients underwent an 80 -day gluten challenge. Urinary samples were obtained before and 10, 20, 40, and 80 days after starting the gluten challenge. The Griess reagent method was used for measuring urinary NOx. RESULTS: Gluten challenge confirmed the diagnosis of celiac disease in 15 of 20 patients. The NOx:creatinine ratios (mmol:mmol) of the biopsy-confirmed celiac disease patients were significantly higher than those of the unconfirmed celiac disease patients (0. 67 vs. 0. 17 on day 10; 0. 78 vs. 0. 15 on day 20; 0. 85 vs. 0. 25 on day 40; and 0. 85 vs. 0. 17 on day 80). CONCLUSIONS: Gluten challenge resulted in an increased urinary NOx:creatinine ratio in patients with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease. The NOx:creatinine ratio could be useful for the serial evaluation of disease activity...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Coeliac disease (CD), a <b>gluten-induced</b> <b>enteropathy,</b> {{alters the}} {{composition}} and function of duodenal intraepithelial T cells. The intestine also harbours four types of CD 3 -negative intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) with largely unknown function: CD 56 (-) CD 127 (-), CD 56 (-) CD 127 (+), CD 56 (+) CD 127 (-) and CD 56 (+) CD 127 (+). Here we aimed to gain insight into the potential function of these innate IELs in health and disease. Design: We determined the phenotypes, relative abundance and differentiation potential of these innate IEL subsets in duodenal biopsies from controls and patients with CD or patients with refractory CD type II (RCDII). Results: Hierarchical clustering analysis of the expression of 15 natural killer and T cell surface markers showed that innate IELs differed markedly from innate peripheral blood lymphocytes and divided innate IEL subsets into two main branches: a CD 127 (-) branch expressing high levels of interleukin (IL) 2 / 15 R beta but no IL- 21 R, and a CD 127 (+) branch with the opposite phenotype. While CD was characterised by the contraction of all four innate IEL subsets, a selective expansion of CD 56 (-) CD 127 (-) and CD 56 (-) CD 127 (+) innate IEL was detected in RCDII. In vitro, {{in the presence of}} IL- 15, CD 56 (-) CD 127 (-) IEL from controls and patients with CD, but not from patients with RCDII, differentiated into functional natural killer and T cells, the latter largely dependent on notch-signalling. Furthermore, compared with non-coeliac controls, CD 56 (-) CD 127 (-) IEL from patients with CD expressed more intracellular CD 3 epsilon and CD 3 gamma and gave more pronounced T cell differentiation. Conclusions: Thus, we demonstrate previously unappreciated diversity and plasticity of the innate IEL compartment and its loss of differentiation potential in patients with RCDII...|$|E
