5000|$|The {{first step}} in making {{paraffin}} wax is to remove the oil (de-oiling or <b>de-waxing)</b> from the slack wax. The oil is separated through crystallization. Most commonly, the slack wax is heated, mixed {{with one or more}} solvents such as a ketone and then cooled. As it cools wax crystallizes out of the solution, leaving only oil in the solution. This mixture is filtered into two streams: solid (wax plus some solvent) and liquid (oil and solvent). After the solvent is recovered by distillation, the resulting products are called [...] "product wax" [...] (or [...] "press wax") and [...] "foots oil". The lower the percentage of oil in the wax the more refined it is considered (semi-refined versus fully refined). The product wax may be further processed to remove colors and odors. The wax may finally be blended together to give certain desired properties such as melt point and penetration. Paraffin wax is sold in either liquid or solid form.|$|E

In the system Nezara viridula and its egg parasitoid Trissolcus basalis, previous {{studies have shown that}} the kairomone mediating such behavior is part of N. viridula’s cuticular hydrocarbons. In this study, the effect of epicuticular waxes of leaves of broad bean, Vicia faba, on wasp response to footprints of N. viridula females are investigated. Plants with intact waxes layer were used (1) without host chemical contamination, or (2) contaminated by host female footprints. Mechanically <b>de-waxed</b> plants were tested (3) without host chemical contamination, or (4) <b>de-waxed</b> a few minutes after being contaminated, or (5) <b>de-waxed</b> about 30 min before being contaminated by host female footprints. And, finally, female wasps were tested on the side of the gum arabic film that had been appressed to (6) the adaxial leaf surface of plants without host chemical contamination, and (7) to plants contaminated by host footprints. Direct contact solid-phase microextraction of the adaxial leaf surface of broad bean plants analyzed by GC/MS showed that epicuticular waxes contained high concentrations of hydrocarbons and alcohols, and low concentrations of aldehydes and esters. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the epicuticular waxes occurred as a film densely crystallized as irregularly shaped platelets with spherical granules randomly distributed. These findings demonstrated that epicuticular waxes of broad bean leaves can mediate the foraging behaviour of T. basalis females by absorbing host adult footprints contact kairomone...|$|R

40|$|The {{slippery}} zone in pitchers of the {{carnivorous plant}} Nepenthes alata bears scattered prominent lunate cells and displays continuous epicuticular crystalline wax coverage. The {{aim of this}} study was to examine the influence of the surface anisotropy, caused by the shape of lunate cells, on insect attachment ability. Traction tests with ladybird beetles Coccinella septempunctata were performed in two types of experiments, where surface samples of (1) intact pitchers, (2) chemically <b>de-waxed</b> pitchers, and (3) their polymer replicas were placed horizontally. Beetle traction forces were measured when they walked on test surfaces in either an upward (towards the peristome) or downward (towards the pitcher bottom) direction, corresponding to the upright or inverted positions of the pitcher. On intact pitcher surfaces covered with both lunate cells and wax crystals, experiments showed significantly higher forces in the direction towards the pitcher bottom. To distinguish between the contributions, from claw interlocking and pad adhesion, to insect attachment on the pitcher surfaces, intact versus claw-ablated beetles were used in the second type of experiment. On both <b>de-waxed</b> plant samples and their replicas, intact insects generated much higher forces in the downward direction compared to the upward one, whereas clawless insects did not. These results led to the conclusion that, (i) due to the particular shape of lunate cells, the pitcher surface has anisotropic properties in terms of insect attachment, and (ii) claws were mainly responsible for attachment enhancement in the downward pitcher direction, since, in this direction, they could interlock with overhanging edges of lunate cells...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this work, two {{different}} consolidation techniques {{were used to}} obtain AlN samples: slip casting and dry pressing of granules obtained from aqueous suspensions by freeze granulation. The green samples were sintered at a temperature (1750 ºC) lower than those usually used (> 1800 ºC), using CaF 2 and YF 3 as sintering aids. The microstructural features were analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the crystalline phases formed were identified by X-ray (XRD). Full dense AlN-based ceramics were obtained from both consolidation techniques; however the thermal conductivity values were quite different. The presence of carbon in the samples derived from the freeze granulated powder containing organic processing additives <b>de-waxed</b> in an inert atmosphere revealed to be helpful in the cleaning of oxygen present at the grain boundaries and consequently, for enhancing the thermal conductivity...|$|R

In the oviduct Ca 2 + maintains ciliary beat and regulates movement of isthmus lumen. The present research investigated {{the expression of the}} MOR in the oviduct of mares during oestrus and anoestrus. Tissue fragments were fixed in 4 % (w/v) paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin wax. 4 mm thick <b>de-waxed</b> sections were incubated with a primary rabbit polyclonal antibody against the third extra-cellular loop of the mouse MOR. Immunohistochemical visualisation was obtained using the ABC-DAB procedure. Immunoblotting analysis was performed to confirm the primary antibody specificity. Ciliated (CCs) and non-ciliated (NCs) cells showed MOR in the apical region which displayed a different staining intensity along the oviduct during the two sexual stages. During the anoestrus numerous isthmus CCs expressed intra-nuclear immunostaining Infundibulum and ampulla immunoreactive NCs increased during the oestrus. Stromal cells expressed MOR in the isthmus. MOR positive myocytes were differently arranged along the oviduct and were more stained in oestrus. The different MOR expression along the oviduct and during anoestrus and oestrus could depend on the roles of oviduct segments and may reflect stage-dependent functional changes...|$|R

Double fluorescent staining with tyramine amplification technique was done as described in details recently [26], with the following primary antibodies. For formalin-fixed tissue, VEGFR- 2 -specific (Cell Signaling # 2479 BC), VEGFR- 1 -specific (Abcam C-terminal-specific #Ab 2350), and CD 31 -specific (DiaNova #DIA- 310 -M); for snap-frozen primary tumors and visceral metastases, CD 31 -specific and VEGFR- 2 -specific antibodies (BD Pharmingen # 550274 and # 550549) and CD 206 -specific antibody (Serotek # 1111) were used.

40|$|Tandem {{catalysis}} is {{an attractive}} strategy to intensify chemical processes but simultaneous control over the individual and concerted catalyst performances poses a challenge. We show that enhanced pore transport within a Co/Al 2 O 3 Fischer-Tropsch (FT) catalyst with a hierarchical porosity enables its tandem integration with a Pt/ZSM- 5 zeolitic hydrotreating catalyst in a spatially distant fashion ‒ permitting a catalyst-specific temperature adjustment ‒ albeit resembling a close active site proximity ‒ by mitigating secondary reactions of primary FT α-olefin products. This approach enables the conciliation of in situ <b>de-waxing</b> with a minimum production of gases (18 wt%) and an up to two-fold higher (50 wt%) selectivity to middle-distillates compared to benchmark mesoporous FT catalysts.

Precise histopathological diagnosis of brain tumours is to some extent subjective. Furthermore, currently available diagnostic imaging techniques to delineate the excision border during cytoreductive surgery lack the required spatial precision to aid surgeons. We set out to determine whether infrared (IR) and/or Raman spectroscopy combined with multivariate analysis {{could be applied to}} discriminate between normal brain tissue and different tumour types (meningioma, glioma and brain metastasis) based on the unique spectral "fingerprints" of their biochemical composition. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks of normal brain and different brain tumours were <b>de-waxed,</b> mounted on low-E slides and desiccated before being analyzed using attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform IR (ATR-FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy showed a clear segregation between normal and different tumour subtypes. Discrimination of tumour classes was also apparent with Raman spectroscopy. Further analysis of spectral data revealed changes in brain biochemical structure associated with different tumours. Decreased tentatively-assigned lipid-to-protein ratio was associated with increased tumour progression. Alteration in cholesterol esters-to-phenylalanine ratio was evident in grade IV glioma and metastatic tumours. The current study indicates that IR and/or Raman spectroscopy have the potential to provide a novel diagnostic approach in the accurate diagnosis of brain tumours and have potential for application in intra-operative diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Sorghum is {{a drought}} {{resistant}} indigenous African cereal and traditional food crop. Unfortunately. milling sorghum. as is normally done using a Prairie Research Laboratory (PRL) -type abrasive dehuller is not effective. Because in sorghum the germ is integral in the grain. {{the process of}} removing the outer bran layers by abrasion leads to high losses, up {{to as much as}} 40 % if a flour of less than I% fat is to be produced. The pericarp of sorghum is rich in cellulose and hemicelluloses, and the germ, lipids. Specific hydrolytic enzymes should degrade these chemical components and thus remove the bran and germ with minimal loss of grain material. In this work. four industrial enzymes. endo-β-glucanase. xylanase. pectinase and lipase were applied either singly or in combination to two different commercial batches of sorghum to determine whether hydrolytic enzymes could be used to decorticate sorghum grain. Sorghum grain was either <b>de-waxed</b> with hexane or scraped to remove the waxy material on the pericarp and seed coats. The grain was then soaked in a 10 % (w/w) solution of either single or combined enzymes in flasks which were then incubated at 50 °C in a water bath and left overnight with shaking. SEM showed that endo-β-glucanase caused decortication of the sorghum grain at the seed coat/aleurone layer interface with both the hexane <b>de-waxed</b> grain and the scraped one. The germ was not removed. The results suggested that endo-β-glucanase hydrolysed the exposedpericarp cell wall material and thus loosened the pericarp, and hence its removal. The germ could not be removed perhaps due to the fact that, in sorghum grain the germ/endosperm interface is at right angles {{to the surface of the}} grain, thus enzymes have only a small area to act on and all the underlying interface is not accessible. Different endo-β-glucanase concentrations were applied to partially decorticated sorghum grain to establish the optimum concentration to be used to remove the pericarp material to an acceptable level. The lowest level when there was a good decortication effect, as indicated by grain ash content and colour, was at 0. 01 % endo-β-glucanase concentration (ml/l 00 g grain). The effectiveness of enzymic and mechanical decortication was compared in terms of the relationships between decortication yield and grain ash content, and between decortication yield and grain colour. To reduce the grain ash to an acceptable level (about 1. 1 %), enzyme decortication resulted in about 10 % saving in grain material relative to the mechanical process. However. at the same decortication yield. the mechanical process gave a lighter product than the enzymIc process. It appears that endo-β-glucanase can remove the pencarp from sorghum grain at an economically feasible concentration (0. 01 %). and that there is significant reduction of grain material loss relative to the mechanical process. However, more work needs to be done to improve the colour of the product. and to find a way to remove the germ. Dissertation (MSc (Food Science)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2006.

40|$|Surgical {{management}} of ovarian tumours largely {{depends on their}} histo-pathological diagnosis. Currently, screening for ovarian malignancy with tumour markers in conjunction with radiological investigations has a low specificity for discriminating benign from malignant tumours. Also, pre-operative biopsy of ovarian masses {{increases the risk of}} intra-peritoneal dissemination of malignancy. Intra-operative frozen section, although sufficiently accurate in differentiating tumours according to their histological type, increases operation times. This results in increased surgery-related risks to the patient and additional burden to resource allocation. We set out to determine whether attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, combined with chemometric analysis can be applied to discriminate between normal, borderline and malignant ovarian tumours and classify ovarian carcinoma subtypes according to the unique spectral signatures of their molecular composition. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded ovarian tissue blocks were <b>de-waxed,</b> mounted on Low-E slides and desiccated before being analysed using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. Chemometric analysis in the form of principal component analysis (PCA), successive projection algorithm (SPA) and genetic algorithm (GA), followed by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) of the obtained spectra revealed clear segregation between benign versus borderline versus malignant tumours as well as segregation between different histological tumour subtypes, when these approaches are used in combination. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy coupled with chemometric analysis has the potential to provide a novel diagnostic approach in the accurate diagnosis of ovarian tumours assisting surgical decision making to avoid under-treatment or over-treatment, with minimal impact to the patient...|$|R
40|$|Endogenous opioid {{peptides}} play {{an important}} role in the regulation of the reproductive system. These peptides act through three main subtypes of opioid receptors: μ, δ, κ. The μ-opioid receptor (MOR) is the primary site of action of several endogenous opioid peptides. The expression of MOR protein has been found in the bovine uterus, but its cellular location is not known. The aim of this study was to localize the MOR in the bovine uterus by means of immunohistochemistry. Tissue fragments were fixed overnight in 4 % (w/v) phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde at 4 °C and routinely embedded in paraffin wax. Sections 4 mm thick were cut and, after <b>de-waxing,</b> they were incubated in a 1 : 1500 dilution of primary rabbit polyclonal antibody against the third extracellular loop of the mouse MOR (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA). Immunohistochemical visualisation was obtained using the Vecta-lab “Elite” (ABC) kit (Vector, Burlingame, CA) and by incubating with a DAB solution. MOR was revealed in some scattered cells along the epithelium lining the endomentrium which showed immunoreactivity in most stromal cells. Immunoreactivity was also detected in muscle cells of myometrium and blood vessels. Since the expression of MOR was observed in both the endometrium and the myometrium, it is possible to infer that in bovine uterus, as in other mammals (Zhu and Pintar 1998, Biol. Reprod. 195 : 451 - 5), the endogenous opioid system could be implicated in the embryo-maternal interaction, in the uterine contractility and in the analgesia...|$|E

40|$|In {{investment}} casting, {{the removal}} of wax from the shell is a critical step which may cause shell failure. It would be advantageous to predict the stress development during <b>de-waxing</b> process with computer simulation. The process was simulated with the consideration of two aspects: (i) The thermo-physical data required to model the shell and wax behaviour in the autoclave environment and (ii) A simulation capable of capturing the interaction between shell, wax and the autoclave environment. Data on mechanical properties, thermal properties, permeability, rheology, thermal expansion and density was gathered for wax and shell as appropriate. Flow- 3 D was used to simulate the de-wax process such that the shell and wax can be simultaneously modelled. It was shown that the Von misses stress exceeded the expected critical failure stress at certain nodes after steam {{was introduced to the}} system. Waxes with higher viscosity were predicted to reach the critical stress sooner. The simulation showed that for the selected drainage orifice sizes that was no or little difference in the time taken to reach the critical stress. Wax compressibility which was considered to represent shell permeability was predicted to have a large effect on shell cracking prediction. In general, the statistics of failure in validation test limited the conclusions that could be drawn. Waxes predicted to show differences in cracking and drainage with increasing orifice size did so in the experiment. The simulated drainage times were greater than determined experimentally by around 380 s and this requires further investigation...|$|E

The green color of peels-on thermally processed (canned) pears was successfully retained by complexation of magnesium-free chlorophyll with zinc ions, and the red pigments were stabilized through anthocyanin-stannous complexation and polymerization of pear peel materials Blanching <b>de-waxed</b> green pears (Bartlett and Comice) in zinc solution (1, 300 - 5, 200 ppm) prior to canning resulted in attractive green color on the peels-on canned pears. Zinc pheophytin a {{was found to be}} the major zinc chlorophyll derivative created from pheophytin a and zinc ions in finished canned pears. The higher the zinc concentration in blanching solution and the longer the blanching time (6 - 18 min), the higher the chromacity of the color in canned green pears. The color of canned pears was highly stable during storage and did not show significant change after 19 wk of storage at 38 °C or at least 35 wk of storage at 10 °C under intensive illumination. Red D'Anjou pears were tested with various individual metallic ions in aqueous solutions for pigment complexation with anthocyanins. A formula containing stannous, hydrochloric acid, formalin, and tannic acid was then developed as a pretreatment for stabilizing anthocyanins on the peels of red pears during thermal process. The stabilization was achieved through complexation with stannous ions which integrated the pigments in a cross-linked macromolecular matrix. Tannic acid and formaldehyde were the key reagents for the polymerization of pear peels. The effectiveness of the developed formula was found to be significantly enhanced by steam-heating of treated red pears prior to canning. This study significantly improved our understandings on the principles of pigment retention during thermal process, especially for red anthocyanins in processed fruits and vegetables.

This thesis reports the repurposing of renewable resources which included wheat straw, biomass ash, waste cardboard (paper) and paper de-inking residues (DIR) to extract, synthesize and produce potentially high value chemicals, materials and composites. Biosilicate solutions were successfully extracted from biomass ash including wheat straw ash and miscanthus ash with aqueous potassium hydroxide solutions. Systematic analyses had been applied on the extraction of biosilicate solutions to obtain different types of silicate solutions for further applications of binder and mesoporous materials. Biosilicate solutions extracted from miscanthus ash were utilized as binders to make bioboards, whilst biosilicate solutions extracted from wheat straw ash were utilized as a silica resource to synthesize biobased mesoporous materials, namely bio-MCM- 41 and bio-SBA- 15. N 2 porosimetry analysis revealed that mesoporous silica made from biosilicate solutions gave a surface area of bio-MCM- 41 of > 1000 m 2 g- 1 and a surface area of > 800 m 2 g- 1 for bio-SBA- 15. XRD, SEM and TEM analyses for both bio-MCM- 41 and bio-SBA- 15 revealed significant ordering pores, structure and the hexagonal arrays. Different kinds of renewable resources including wheat straw, pea pod waste and paper de-inking residue with the binder of biosilicate solutions and other chemical additives such as protein and starch were processed to bioboards. Also, wheat straw powder was added into cardboard/paper sheets to decrease the cost of paper manufacture and to improve mechanical properties. <b>De-waxed</b> wheat straw cardboard/paper sheets was successfully incorporated in to paper pulp to give a tensile index of 30 - 34 Nm/g similar with respect to conventional cardboard paper (tensile index of 30 - 32 Nm/g).

40|$|Purpose: Purpose of {{this paper}} was to present the {{benefits}} of powder metallurgy technology and development ofsinter-hardening process. The mechanical properties, focusing in particular on hardness and wear resistance, oftwo different carbon levels pre-alloyed steel powders processed with sinter-hardening method, were described. Microstructure characteristic of produced sinter-hardened Ni-Mo steels with increasing amount of tungsten(from 0 to 0. 3 % wt.) was taken under consideration. Design/methodology/approach: Different compositions have been tested in order to investigate the influenceof various tungsten additions into low (0. 4 %) and high (0. 6 %) carbon content of pre-alloyed steel powders. Powders, with addition of 0. 7 % lubricant, were pressed in a 2000 kN hydraulic press. <b>De-waxing</b> process at 550 ºC for 60 minutes in a fully nitrogen atmosphere was performed before the sintering. Sintering was carriedout in vacuum furnace with argon backfilling. The furnace was equipped with a cooling zone to provideaccelerated cooling from the sintering temperature. Green compacts were sintered at the temperature 1120 ºC for 1 hour and rapidly cooled with a rate 2. 5 ºC/s. Findings: The applied sinter-hardening process resulted with achievement of material characterized by goodwear resistance. The investigation of Ni-Mo and Ni-Mo-W sinter-hardened steels with low and high carboncontent proved that applied process of sintering under vacuum and rapid cooling brought expected outcome. Research limitations/implications: Considering the achieved outcome, it was revealed that chemical compositionand applied process of steels preparation, sinter-hardening with the cooling rate 2. 5 ºC/s, results in achieving materialswith relatively high hardness and significant resistance to abrasion. Anyhow, further research should be performed. Originality/value: Sinter-hardening of Ni-Mo pre-alloyed powders with the addition of different additions oftungsten, especially in terms of hardenability and wear resistance, was investigated...|$|E
40|$|The current, commercially available, {{press and}} sinter Al-Mg-Si-Cu alloys {{are based on}} wrought or cast alloy {{compositions}} and have not been tailored for the press and sinter process. The limited development of the Al-Mg-Si-Cu alloys for the press and sinter process can be partly attributed to a poor understanding {{of the effects of}} processing conditions on the sintering behaviour. The primary objective of this work was to investigate and understand the effects of processing conditions on the sintering behaviour of Al-Mg-Si-Cu-(Sn) alloys. Dilatometry was used in conjunction with other experimental techniques to elucidate and understand the expansion and shrinkage events that occur during the liquid-phase sintering of Al-Mg-Si-Cu-(Sn) powder metallurgy alloys. Samples were uni-axially pressed from elemental metal powder blends, <b>de-waxed,</b> and then sintered in a horizontal push-rod dilatometer to record the dimensional changes in the pressing direction. The processing conditions examined included the alloy composition, temperature, green density and atmosphere. A liquid forms during heating due to reactions between the alloying elements and the aluminium. This liquid is initially non-wetting on the oxide layer of the aluminium particles, resulting in separation of the particles, which is manifested by expansion of the sample. The oxide is reduced as sintering progresses, alleviating the non-wetting conditions. When more liquid forms, further expansion occurs, despite the improved wetting conditions. It is proposed that atmospheric oxygen and/or nitrogen can react with the liquid, forming a solid phase (‘shell’) at the liquid-vapour interfaces. These shells prevent the liquid from wetting the particles, resulting in further expansion and preventing shrinkage. Unbalanced diffusivities (the Kirkendall effect) between the aluminium and silicon contribute to the expansion. A mechanism is proposed to account for the transition to shrinkage, whereby the shells at the liquid-vapour interface rupture when there is a rapid increase in the volume of contained liquid. The liquid then flows out and over the shells, onto the aluminium substrate, causing shrinkage. Magnesium and nitrogen delay the transition to shrinkage by facilitating nitride shell formation at the solid-liquid interface. Silicon and tin cause an earlier transition to shrinkage by increasing the liquid volume. In addition, tin promotes shrinkage by segregating to the liquid-vapour interfaces, limiting the thickness of the shells at the liquid-vapour interfaces. The two dominant liquid-phase shrinkage mechanisms during the sintering of Al-Mg-Si-Cu-(Sn) alloys are rearrangement and pore-filling. Contact-flattening is not a dominant shrinkage mechanism, but may occur concurrently with the other mechanisms. If contact flattening occurs, a decrease in the pressure of isolated pores increases the total shrinkage rate. Nitrogen increases the shrinkage rate during rearrangement by restricting grain-growth. Magnesium increases the shrinkage rate during rearrangement by reducing the solid-liquid interface energy. Magnesium and nitrogen are essential for the formation of nitride within isolated pores, which decreases the pore pressure and increases the contribution of contact-flattening on the total shrinkage rate. Silicon reduces the beneficial influence of magnesium during rearrangement by diluting the magnesium content in the liquid. Silicon increases the pore-filling rate due to an increase in the liquid volume. Magnesium increases the pore-filling rate by facilitating aluminium nitride formation within isolated pores and by increasing the pore-filling. Tin additions can decrease the pore-filling rate due to its segregation to the liquid-vapour interface, limiting the consumption of nitrogen within isolated pores...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} test the effects of {{environmental}} factors on different characteristics of plant leaf waxes, barley plants (Hordeum vulgare) were abiotically stress treated (exposure to darkness, heavy metal, high salt concentrations and drought), and biotically stressed by the infection with powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei; Bgh). Different wax parameters like amount, chemical composition, and micromorphology of epicuticular wax crystals, were investigated. Etiolated leaves of barley showed distinctly reduced wax amounts and modifications in their relative composition. The alterations of these wax parameters might {{be a result of}} a developmental delay, which could have been caused by a decreased availability of energy for cellular processes, due to lack of light. Cadmium exposure led to a 1. 5 -fold increase of wax amount, while chemical composition was unaffected. In drought- and salt-stressed plants, all investigated leaf wax parameters remained unaltered. In each of the abiotic treatments, the microstructure of epicuticular wax crystals, formed as typical platelets, was not modified. Even after 6 d infection with powdery mildew (Bgh), neither locally nor systemically enforced modifications of wax features were revealed. The analyzed leave surfaces, resulting from these four abiotic and the biotic treatment (phenotypic approach), were compared to altered leaf surfaces’ characteristics of 18 analyzed eceriferum (cer-) wax mutants (genotypic approach). Within the screening, 5 mutants were selected which distinctly differed from the wild-type in wax amount, portions of epi- and intracuticular wax fraction, relative chemical composition, crystal morphology, and surface wettability (hydrophobicity). Apart from quantitative and qualitative effects on the leaf waxes, environmentally enforced modifications in cuticular waxes might be reflected in molecular processes of wax biogenesis. Therefore, a barley wax-microarray was established. 254 genes were selected, which are putatively involved in processes of de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, fatty acid elongation, and modification, and which are supposed to take part in lipid-trafficking between cell compartments, and transport of wax components to the outer cell surface. The regulations within the expression pattern evoked by the respective treatments were correlated with the corresponding analytical wax data, and the observed molecular effects of a 3 d powdery mildew infection were compared with succeeding fungal morphogenesis. Etiolation and cadmium exposition pointed to transcriptional modifications in the de novo fatty acid synthesis, and in the screened, transport-related mechanisms, which correlate with respective alterations in surface wax characteristics. Moderate changes in the gene expression pattern, evoked by drought- and salinity-stress, might give hints for evolved adaptations in barley to such common habitat stresses. Theinvasion of powdery mildew into the epidermal host cells was reflected in the regulation of several genes. Beside other functions, these genes take part in pathogen defense, and intracellular component transport, or they encode transcription factors. The different modifications within the molecular responses evoked by the investigated abiotic treatments, and the effects of powdery mildew infection representing a biotic stressor, were compared between the different treatments. In order {{to test the}} potential impact of different wax parameters on Bgh, conidia germination and differentiation was comparably investigated on leaf surfaces of abiotically stressed wild-type and cer-mutants, isolated cuticles, and further artificial surfaces. The rates of conidial development were similar on each of the leaf surfaces resulting from the abiotic treatments, while a significant reduction of the germination and differentiation success was revealed for the wax mutant cer-yp. 949. Compared to the wild-type, developmental rates on isolated cuticles and extracted leaf waxes of the mutant cer-yp. 949 indicated a modified embedding of cuticular waxes, and a possibly changed three-dimensional structure of the cer-yp. 949 cuticle, which might explain the reduced conidial developmental rates on leaf surfaces of this particular mutant. Experiments with Bgh conidia on mechanically <b>de-waxed</b> leaf surfaces (selective mechanical removal of the epicuticular leaf waxes with glue-like gum arabic, followed by an extraction of the intracuticular wax portion with chloroform) demonstrated the importance of the wax coverage for the germination and differentiation of the fungal conidia. On all dewaxed leaf surfaces, except those of cer-yp. 949, the differentiation success of the germlings was significantly reduced, by about 20...|$|R
40|$|Investment casting, {{known as}} the lost wax process too, {{is one of the}} oldest and {{well-known}} manufacturing processes traced back to 5000 BC. As a rule the wax pattern, a disposable specimen in the shape and size of the final product, or the wax pattern assembly is invested into ceramic slurry followed by the application of a coating of dry refractory particles (stucco) which, when dried, gives a thin refractory shell. The application of slurry and stucco is repeated, with drying between each successive coat, until the shell mould of sufficient thickness is achieved. Following completion of shell build, <b>de-waxing</b> and shell hardening processes get ready the shell for the following pouring of the molten metal into the expendable ceramic mould. The production of the investment casting ceramic mould is a crucial part of the whole process. The use of an expendable pattern confers an unique advantage to the investment casting process because the pattern is removed from the mould without any disturbance of the latter, but the continuous shell changing produces a random changing on the boundary conditions that directly affect the casting success. A method to quickly find out the thermo-physical properties of the mould is desirable to reach two main goals:. the controlling of the ceramic shell production;. the evaluation of the ceramic thermo-physical properties in order to provide reliable boundary conditions to the numerical simulation and to well simulate the critical process of metal solidification. The thermophysical properties of the ceramic mould strongly influences the boundary condition imposed to the metal during solidification and it is because the technique proposed in this work may be helpful to increase the reliability of the numerical casting simulation because it is often based on fixed data that do not take into account the random variability of the mould building process and also the influence of the process parameters (i. e. hardening time, slurry and stucco composition, slurry viscosity) on the thermophysical properties are partially or completely unknown. The transient cooling process of a ceramic isotropic thin slab starting from high temperature down to room temperature will be experimentally investigated using IR thermography and the superficial temperature Tm will be compared against the surface temperature drop Tn numerically generated. Varying thermo-physical properties of the numerical model is possible to find out its value in correspondence on the minimum of the norm of the vectorial difference (Tn - Tm). The technique modelling must be build to take into account the properties dependence on the temperature since the range of temperature must be necessarily wide. This is a typical inverse problem: given the effects (time variation of surface temperatures) the causes (the material properties) must be estimated. Inverse problems are typical ill-posed problems since the solution can be extremely sensible to the noise and can be unstable. The well-known trust-region-reflective algorithm will be used for the error minimization between experimental surface temperature and numerical surface temperature which is a parametric function depending on the unknown parameters. Also the error analysis has been carried out...|$|E
40|$|This project {{addresses}} {{improvements in}} metal casting processes by reducing scrap {{and reducing the}} cost of production, due to scrap reduction from investment casting and yield improvement offered by lost foam casting as compared to no-bake or green sand molding. The objectives for the investment casting portion of the subtask are to improve knowledge of fracture toughness of mold shells and the sources of strength limiting flaws and to understand the effects of wax reclamation procedures on wax properties. Applying 'clean steel' approaches to pouring technology and cleanliness in investment casting of steel are anticipated to improve incoming materials inspection procedures as they affect the microstructure and toughness of the shell. This project focused on two areas of study {{in the production of}} steel castings to reduce scrap and save energy: (1) Reducing the amount of shell cracking in investment cast steel production; (2) Investigate the potential of lost foam steel casting The basic findings regarding investment casting shell cracking were: (1) In the case of post pouring cracking, this could be related to phase changes in silica upon cooling and could be delayed by pouring arrangement strategies that maintained the shell surface at temperature for longer time. Employing this delay resulted in less adherent oxidation of castings since the casting was cooler at the time o fair exposure. (2) A model for heat transfer through water saturated shell materials under steam pressure was developed. (3) Initial modeling result of autoclave <b>de-waxing</b> indicated the higher pressure and temperature in the autoclave would impose a steeper temperature gradient on the wax pattern, causing some melt flow prior to bulk expansion and decreasing the stress on the green shell. Basic findings regarding lost foam casting of steel at atmospheric pressure: (1) EPS foam generally decomposes by the collapse mode in steel casting. (2) There is an accumulation of carbon pick-up {{at the end of the}} casting opposite the gate. (3) It is recommended that lost foam castings in steel be gated for a quiescent fill in an empty cavity mold to prevent foam occlusion defects from the collapse mode. The energy benefit is primarily in yield savings and lower casting weight per function due to elimination of draft and parting lines for the larger lost foam castings. For the smaller investment casting, scrap losses due to shell cracking will be reduced. Both of these effects will reduce the metal melted per good ton of castings. There will also be less machine stock required per casting which is a yield savings and a small additional energy savings in machining. Downstream savings will come from heavy truck and railroad applications. Application of these processes to heavy truck castings will lighten the heavy truck fleet by about ten pounds per truck. Using ten years to achieve full penetration of the truck fleet at linear rate this will result in a fuel savings of 131 trillion BTU over ten years...|$|E
