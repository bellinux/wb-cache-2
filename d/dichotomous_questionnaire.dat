40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method of}} explorative data analysis which allows to detect logical implications between items of a <b>dichotomous</b> <b>questionnaire</b> or test. These logi-cal dependencies are organized to form a hierarchical structure (quasi-order) on the items. Our analysis method, which is called Inductive Item Tree Analysis, {{can be seen as}} a method of Boolean analysis. We discuss the relation of our method to other methods of Boolean analysis and to related methods of data analysis, like for example Guttman scaling and latent class analysis. The adequacy of our analysis method is tested in a simulation study. The results of this study show that the method is able to detect existing dependencies with high accuracy if enough data are available. We ap-ply our method to some real data sets to demonstrate the advantages of an analysis of logical implications...|$|E

The research was of projective type of field of descriptive character. The population was 60 parents surveyed with a <b>dichotomous</b> <b>questionnaire</b> with answers of alternatives Yes and No. The validity was made through the technique of expert judgments, for instrument validation and reliability Kuder Richardson his score was 0. 8377 (high reliability). Likewise, descriptive statistics were used by means of the percentage technique, the values ​​were analyzed according to the responses issued by the subjects under study. The presentation was made through tables by dimensions and bar graphs. Among the findings were: parents surveyed do not handle authority, nor communicate in an operative way with their children, paying little attention to the affective part; there is also evidence of lack of Authority-Affect exercise as a hierarchical level to develop norms in the Internet use of their children. These results warranted the design of the established program...|$|E

In addition, it compares the estimates obtained from these real choices in the field with those obtained through a hypothetical <b>dichotomous</b> choice <b>questionnaire</b> administered to patients from the same clinic (throughout the text, we refer to this second as a contingent valuation (CV) exercise).|$|R
30|$|We exploit {{a unique}} field {{experiment}} {{to recover the}} willingness to pay (WTP) for shorter waiting times at a cataract detection clinic in Mexico City, and compare the results with those obtained through a hypothetical <b>dichotomous</b> choice <b>questionnaire.</b> The WTP to avoid a minute of wait obtained from the field experiment ranges from 0.59 to 0.82 Mexican pesos (1 USD[*]=[*] 12.5 Mexican pesos {{at the time of}} the survey), while that from the hypothetical choice experiment ranges from 0.33 to 0.48 Mexican pesos. WTP to avoid the wait is lower for lower income individuals, and it is larger the more accurately the announced expected waiting time matches the true values. Finally, we find evidence that the marginal disutility of waiting is not constant.|$|R
30|$|Researchers have {{attempted}} to estimate forest conservation values using various approaches. For example, Echeverria et al. (1995) estimated the value of existence benefits in Costa Rica’s forests, based on a Contingent Valuation (CV) method {{and came up with}} a value of $ 238 per hectare of forest per year. Lehtonen et al. (2003) estimated the average conservation value of forests in southern Finland in terms of the willingness to pay at $ 23.80 per household per year, using CV in conjunction with Double Bounded <b>Dichotomous</b> <b>questionnaires</b> and a logit regression model. In another study, Leong et al. (2005) studied the conservation value of forests in mountainous areas of Malaysia and estimated conservation values ranging from 20 to 27 Ringgits per individual respondent. Gurluk (2006) used a Contingent Valuation approach to study the value of ecosystem services in a region in Turkey and estimated it at $ 76.94 per year per household. Tao et al. (2012), also using a CV method, estimated the annual household willingness to pay for conservation of Heshui forest ecosystems in China’s Jiangshi Province at 238 Yuan per year. Molaei in (2009) used a Contingent Valuation method to assess the conservation value of Arasbaran forest ecosystems and showed that 81.7 % of the people from this area were willing to pay some money for conservation of the forest ecosystem. They estimated the annual WTP for the conservation of these forest ecosystems at about $ 3.31 per household and $ 197.321 per hectare of forest land. Peron and Esmaeili (2010) used the Contingent Valuation approach to estimate the conservation value of mangrove forests in Hormozgan province in Iran and found that 92 % of the respondents were willing to pay some money to conserve these mangrove forests. They estimated the average conservation value per individual at $ 12.65 and at $ 76.94 per hectare of forest.|$|R
40|$|Background: Biostatistics is an {{integral}} part of research protocols. In any field of inquiry or investigation, data obtained is subsequently classified, analyzed and tested for accuracy by statistical methods. Statistical analysis of collected data, thus, forms the basis for all evidence-based conclusions. Aim: The aim of this study is to evaluate the cognition, comprehension and application of biostatistics in research among post graduate students in Periodontics, in India. Materials and Methods: A total of 391 post graduate students registered for a master′s course in periodontics at various dental colleges across India were included in the survey. Data regarding the level of knowledge, understanding and its application in design and conduct of the research protocol was collected using a <b>dichotomous</b> <b>questionnaire.</b> A descriptive statistics was used for data analysis. Results: Nearly 79. 2 % students were aware of the importance of biostatistics in research, 55 - 65 % were familiar with MS-EXCEL spreadsheet for graphical representation of data and with the statistical softwares available on the internet, 26. 0 % had biostatistics as mandatory subject in their curriculum, 9. 5 % tried to perform statistical analysis on their own while 3. 0 % were successful in performing statistical analysis of their studies on their own. Conclusion: Biostatistics should play a central role in planning, conduct, interim analysis, final analysis and reporting of periodontal research especially by the postgraduate students. Indian postgraduate students in periodontics are aware of the importance of biostatistics in research but the level of understanding and application is still basic and needs to be addressed...|$|E
40|$|In {{the field}} of second {{language}} acquisition (SLA), the study abroad context (SA) has gained attention as a site that offers the potential of significant second language (L 2) development due to high amounts of input and interaction opportunities compared to at home foreign language (AH) and domestic immersion (IM) contexts (Pérez-Vidal, 2014). In previous research, the SA context has been {{a country where the}} L 2 is the local language (e. g., English in the United Kingdom). However, with the increase of student mobility programs across Europe, such as ERASMUS, and the status of English as an International Language, another study abroad context is available, one where students can take English-medium classes and use English as a lingua franca in a country where English is not the local language (e. g., Germany, Poland, Spain). In the current study, this new context is operationalized as English as a lingua franca study abroad (ELFSA), the effects of which have received very little attention in SLA to date. By providing an alternative SA context through English medium of instruction on-campus, and English as an international language through off-campus interactions, this new context might bring further insights into the SA phenomenon. Motivated by this gap in the literature, the current longitudinal study aims to investigate the differentiated effects of the SA, ELFSA, and AH contexts on the linguistic development of Turkish undergraduates whose L 2 is English. Given the multilingual nature of the ERASMUS context, this study also examines the contextual influences on participants’ perceptions towards multilingualism from a Perceived Positive Language Interaction (PPLI) perspective (Thompson, 2013). The participants of the study were 50 third year Turkish undergraduates, 33 of whom undertook a 16 -week ERASMUS exchange semester in Spring 2016. Following a quasi-experimental mixed-methods pretest-posttest design, data were collected via a one-minute spoken and 15 -minute written production test to determine linguistic complexity, accuracy, and fluency gains; an Elicited Oral Imitation Test (EIT, Ortega et al., 1999) to measure pre-departure proficiency; a monthly online Language Interaction Questionnaire to investigate the type and amount of language contact; and a <b>dichotomous</b> <b>questionnaire</b> to learn about participants’ perceptions towards multilingualism within PPLI. For triangulation purposes, qualitative data were collected via several open-ended items in the questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. The results of the quantitative and qualitative analysis indicated that the SA and ELFSA contexts were beneficial for English development on most of the measures, yet the former had certain issues for the participants pertaining to the dominant variety and features of spoken English (e. g., weak forms, connected speech, speech rate). The ELFSA was reported to be more multilingual as compared to the SA, also paving the way for seeing further Perceived Positive Language Interaction (Thompson, 2013) among the additional languages that their participants knew. The major difference between the two was described to be the ELFSA participants’ developing an ELF identity towards using English as an L 2, as they tended to prioritize fluency over accuracy throughout their exchange semester. The results of the quantitative analysis indicated that the AH group had significantly more gains on written fluency than the two abroad groups. Also, time was found to be a significant factor for lexical development regardless of group differences. In terms of oral gains, main effects of time indicated that the participants as a whole group had significantly different means over time on speech rate and breakdown fluency, the inspection of which showed that the ELFSA had the highest mean differences. As for oral accuracy and lexical complexity, an interaction effect between time and context group was found to approach significance, indicating that both sojourn groups had mean gains on the former, while only the ELFSA had higher mean scores in the posttest for the latter measure. Finally, the data from the semi-structured interviews provided a holistic picture of the interplay between context and development in English. The major finding of the study, thus, indicated that the SA may not be the sole provider for intense L 2 input to improve English during a semester abroad; the ELFSA appeared to be equally as beneficial as the SA in terms of linguistic development with a bonus of creating a linguistic identity of an ELF speaker for language learners. The study also provided several empirical and pedagogical implications for those interested in the stay abroad and its influences on L 2 development...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Development and Management) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. The White Paper on National Transport Policy (SA, 1996 : 12) {{identified}} {{the fragmentation of}} functions between different spheres of government {{as one of the}} main obstacles besetting the effective development and management of the transport system. It endorsed one of the principles in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Ad 108 of 1996, to devolve functions to the lowest appropriate sphere of government if it could be more effectively handled and if there was capacity to perform the functions. In pursuing the above objective, {{the purpose of this study}} was to determine the functionality of the West Rand District Municipality in terms of administrative as well as economic and transport management principles to fulfil the role as a transport authority in terms of the NLTTA for its present area of jurisdiction. The study therefore addressed the legal framework as well as transport and economic indicators defining the functional area of a transport authority. In determining the nature and extent of functions as fulfilled by the respective municipalities, use was made of <b>dichotomous</b> <b>questionnaires.</b> These findings were also supported with technical data based on surveys conducted through the Gauteng Household Travel Survey (2000) and the Operating Licensing Strategy (200212003). To further operationalise the research objectives of this study, and touching on Great Britain's transport experience over the past 75 years, a comparison was made between the present status of Transport Authorities in the United Kingdom, compared to those in South Africa (Gauteng Province). Upon analysing the empirical findings it was evident that the establishment of a Transport Authority for the area of jurisdiction of the West Rand would enable the WRDM to deliver on the following number of fronts: • Coherent Alignment to a Common Vision • Integration of Transport System • Control over Transport Modes • Optimised Utilisation of Funds To create a conducive environment for a West Rand Transport Authority to improve its functionality, it was recommended that serious attention be given to aspects such as funding mechanisms, legality of municipal entities, clarity on the status of transport powers at municipal level of government, assignment of functions and human resource capacity. Upon conclusion it was agreed that the successful implementation of a functional transport authority for the West Rand will be dependant, not only upon technical expertise and management and by resolving the above issues, but also on political support.

30|$|Since the WTP {{for some}} goods or goods’ {{attributes}} (such as waiting times for health care) {{is hard to}} recover from real data, over the last decades and increasingly so in health economics, researchers have tried to recover such measures from hypothetical surveys, which use {{a wide array of}} techniques to ask individuals about their “reservation price” for a specific good or good’s attributes. While widely used, an ongoing debate regarding the elicitation of such questions has been taking place for decades. Open-ended questions are widely believed to deliver biased estimates. However, since the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) panel (Arrow et al. 1993) performed a critical review of the existing methods to recover WTP through hypothetical surveys, <b>dichotomous</b> choice (DC) <b>questionnaires</b> are perhaps seen as the most reliable alternative, both because of their simplicity and reduced incentives for strategic behavior (Hoehn and Randall 1987; Carson et al. 1999).|$|R
40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the attitudes of}} biomedical science students (medical students) in a non-Western setting towards three medical ethics concepts {{that are based on}} fundamental Western culture ethical principles. A <b>dichotomous</b> (agree/disagree) response <b>questionnaire</b> was constructed using Western ethnocentric culture (WEC) based perspectives of informed consent, confidentiality, and substitute decision-making. Hypothesized WEC-Biased responses were assigned to the questionnaire's questions or propositions. A number of useful responses (169) were obtained from a large, cross-sectional, convenience sample of the MBChB students at the University of Zimbabwe Medical School. Statistical analysis described the differences in response patterns between the student's responses compared to the hypothesized WEC-Biased response. The effect of the nine independent variables on selected dependent variables (responses to certain questionnaire questions) was analyzed by stepwise logistic regression. Students concurred with the hypothesized WEC-Biased responses for two-thirds of the questionnaire items. This agreement included support for the role of legal advocacy in the substitute decision-making process. The students disagreed with the hypothesized WEC-Biased responses in several important medical ethics aspects. Most notably, the students indicated that persons with mental dysfunctions, as a class, were properly considered incompetent to make treatment decisions. None of the studied independent variables was often associated with students' responses, but training year was more frequently implicated than either ethnicity or gender. In order to develop internationally and culturally relevant medical ethics standards, non-Western perspectives ought to be acknowledged and incorporated. Two main areas for further efforts include: curriculum development in ethics reasoning and related clinical (medico-legal) decision-making processes that would be relevant to medical students from various cultures, and; the testing of models that could increase legal system input in the clinical process in societies with limited jurisprudence resources.
