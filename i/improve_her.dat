5|$|As a child, Sörenstam was {{a talented}} all-round sportsgirl. She was a nationally ranked junior tennis player, played {{football}} (soccer) {{in her hometown}} team Bro IK, and {{was such a good}} skier that the coach of the Swedish national ski team suggested the family move to northern Sweden to <b>improve</b> <b>her</b> skiing year round.|$|E
5|$|Catherine's {{ability to}} bear children, however, failed to <b>improve</b> <b>her</b> marriage. In 1534, {{at the age}} of 15, Henry had taken as his {{mistress}} the 38-year-old Diane de Poitiers, whom he adored {{for the rest of his}} life. Even so, he respected Catherine's status as his consort. When King Francis I died on 31 March 1547, Catherine became queen consort of France. She was crowned in the basilica of Saint-Denis on 10 June 1549.|$|E

5|$|After {{graduating from}} Leeds, Armstrong taught French in East Ham, Greater London for several years; she had {{success in this}} line of work, and was well {{on her way to}} {{becoming}} headmistress by the time she left this position in 1918. While she was Senior Assistant Mistress, she began studying phonetics in the evenings part-time at the University College Phonetics Department in order to <b>improve</b> <b>her</b> teaching of French pronunciation. In 1917, Armstrong received a Diploma with Distinction in French Phonetics; she got a Diploma with Distinction in English phonetics the following year.|$|E
5|$|After the Armistice of Mudros {{was signed}} on 30 October between the Allies and the Ottoman Empire, the ship {{participated in the}} early stage of the {{occupation}} of Constantinople from 12 November to 12 December. Diderot was based in Toulon throughout 1919 and was modernized in 1922–25 to <b>improve</b> <b>her</b> underwater protection. The ship became a training ship in 1927 and was condemned in on 17 March 1937; sold to M. Gosselin-Duriez on 30 July 1937 for 3,557,010 FF, she arrived at Dunkirk for breaking up on 31 August.|$|E
50|$|Frizell {{graduated}} from high school in 2003 and immediately enrolled at the University of Georgia where she competed for three seasons. In her first season, Frizell showed tremendous improvement. She placed ninth at the NCAA Championships and third at the Canadian Track and Field Championships. She also <b>improved</b> <b>her</b> personal bests in the shot put and javelin. She finished the season with a best of 63.36 meters in the hammer throw. In 2005, Frizell <b>improved</b> <b>her</b> best to 66.42 meters. She <b>improved</b> <b>her</b> placing at both the NCAA Championships and Canadian Championships, finishing sixth and second respectively.|$|R

5|$|HMS Dreadnought was an ironclad turret ship {{built for}} the Royal Navy during the 1870s. Construction was halted {{less than a year}} after it began and she was {{redesigned}} to <b>improve</b> <b>her</b> stability and buoyancy. Upon completion in 1879, the ship was placed in reserve until she was commissioned in 1884 for service with the Mediterranean Fleet. Upon her return 10 years later, she became a coast guard ship in Ireland for two years. The ship then became a depot ship in 1897 before she was reclassified as a second-class battleship in 1900. Dreadnought participated in the annual fleet manoeuvres for the next two years before she became a training ship in 1902. The ship was taken out of service three years later and sold for scrap in 1908.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, in {{an effort}} to <b>improve</b> <b>her</b> in-ring skills, Stock {{relocated}} to Monterrey, Mexico to face the female wrestlers there. At the suggestion of a promoter, Stock began working while wearing a mask. She also took on the ring name Dark Angel, on the advice of Eddie Watts. She initially found it difficult to work with the wrestlers in Mexico, as she did not speak Spanish and could not communicate with them throughout the match. On October 17, she defeated Simply Luscious to win the Lucha Libre Femenil Juvenil Championship.|$|E
5|$|Leigh {{appeared}} with Robert Taylor, Lionel Barrymore and Maureen O'Sullivan in A Yank at Oxford (1938), {{which was the}} first of her films to receive attention in the United States. During production, she developed a reputation for being difficult and unreasonable, partly because she disliked her secondary role but mainly because her petulant antics seemed to be paying dividends. After dealing with the threat of a lawsuit brought over a frivolous incident, Korda, however, instructed her agent to warn her that her option would not be renewed if her behaviour did not <b>improve.</b> <b>Her</b> next role was in Sidewalks of London, also known as St. Martin's Lane (1938), with Charles Laughton.|$|E

5|$|Nova {{is highly}} agile, acrobatic, {{and able to}} perform {{maneuvers}} such as mantling and climbing ledges, hanging from pipes, and sliding down ziplines. The player has access to Nova's psionic powers honed through training as a ghost agent, {{such as the ability}} to <b>improve</b> <b>her</b> speed and reflexes drastically. StarCraft: Ghost includes many of the vehicle units featured in StarCraft and StarCraft: Brood War. Some vehicles, such as space battlecruisers and starfighters, only play support roles, while others, such as hoverbikes, scout cars, and futuristic siege tanks, can be piloted by the player.|$|E
5|$|One of Sörenstam's hobbies is cooking. She {{has participated}} in cooking demonstrations during LPGA tournaments and has talked about enrolling in cooking school. Before the 2003 season Sörenstam took the {{opportunity}} to <b>improve</b> <b>her</b> culinary skills by working eight-hour shifts in the kitchens of the Lake Nona Country Club. Sörenstam has had a serious interest in investments, real estate and the stock market since she earned her first LPGA check and in August 2006 was invited to ring the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange.|$|E
5|$|Sarah {{continued}} to appeal against court decisions which ruled that funding for Blenheim {{should come from}} the Marlboroughs' personal estate, and not the government. This made her unpopular; she could easily afford the payments herself. She {{was surprised by the}} grief she felt following the death of her eldest living daughter in 1733. Sarah lived to see her enemy Robert Walpole fall in 1742, and in the same year attempted to <b>improve</b> <b>her</b> reputation by approving a biographical publication titled An Account of the Dowager Duchess of Marlborough from her first coming to Court to the year 1710. She died of old age, at the age of eighty-four, on 18 October 1744, at Marlborough House; she was buried at Blenheim. Her husband’s body was exhumed from Westminster Abbey and buried beside her.|$|E

5|$|The Tomozuru Incident of 12 March 1934, {{in which}} a top-heavy torpedo boat capsized in heavy weather, caused the IJN to {{investigate}} the stability of all their ships, resulting {{in a number of}} design changes to improve stability and increase hull strength. Ryūjō, already known to be only marginally stable, was promptly docked at the Kure Naval Arsenal for modifications that strengthened her keel and added ballast and shallow torpedo bulges to <b>improve</b> <b>her</b> stability. Her funnels were moved higher up the side of her hull and curved downward to keep the deck clear of smoke.|$|E
5|$|The {{announcement}} of her resignation {{was met with}} speculation that San Miguel had been forced by Binibining Pilipinas pageant organizers to relinquish her title {{due to a lack}} of professionalism during preparatory training sessions, which strained the patience of her mentors and superiors. In a later interview, she admitted that due to multiple conflicts in schedule she was unable to attend all the training sessions arranged for her by pageant organizers, which included sessions to <b>improve</b> <b>her</b> speaking ability. She also admitted to throwing a fit in the middle of a rehearsal when she received news that her grandfather was dying, and demanded that she be allowed to leave.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships were}} {{modified}} extensively {{in an attempt}} to rectify their machinery problems. All three ships had their propeller shafts lengthened, and their original bronze screws were replaced with larger steel propellers, though this did not improve performance. Sebenico received the most radical alteration; her stern was lengthened slightly to allow for finer hull lines, which would <b>improve</b> <b>her</b> hydrodynamic shape, though this too failed to provide a significantly higher speed. As a result of her different hull, Sebenico is sometimes not included in the Zara class. Between 1898 and 1901, all four ships were re-boilered.|$|E

5|$|Thunderer, {{the fifth}} ship {{of her name}} {{to serve in the}} Royal Navy, was laid down on 26 June 1869 at Pembroke Dockyard, Wales. Construction was {{subsequently}} halted for a time in 1871 to modify the ship to <b>improve</b> <b>her</b> stability and buoyancy by extending the breastwork to cover the full width of the hull which increased the ship's freeboard amidships and provided additional accommodation for the crew. The ship was launched on 25 March 1872 by Mrs. Mary Meyrick, wife of Thomas Meyrick, MP. Two years later she was transferred to Portsmouth Dockyard to finish fitting out.|$|E
5|$|Virginia {{remained}} in drydock {{for almost a}} month, getting repairs for battle damage as well as minor modifications to <b>improve</b> <b>her</b> performance. On April 4, {{she was able to}} leave drydock. Buchanan, still recovering from his wound, had hoped that Catesby Jones would be picked to succeed him, and most observers believed that Jones's performance during the battle was outstanding. The seniority system for promotion in the Navy scuttled his chances, however, and the post went to the 67-year-old Commodore Josiah Tattnall. Monitor, not severely damaged, remained on duty. Like his antagonist Jones, Greene was deemed too young to remain as captain; the day after the battle, he was replaced with Lieutenant Thomas O. Selfridge. Two days later, Selfridge was in turn relieved by Lieutenant William Nicholson Jeffers.|$|E
5|$|Wyoming then {{returned}} to the routine of winter maneuvers in the Caribbean and training cruises in the summer. In late August, the ship went to Philadelphia for an extensive modernization. Her old coal-fired boilers were replaced with new oil-fired models and anti-torpedo bulges were added to <b>improve</b> <b>her</b> resistance to underwater damage. The work was completed by 2 November, after which Wyoming conducted a shakedown cruise to Cuba and the Virgin Islands. She was back in Philadelphia on 7 December, and two days later, she returned to her post as the flagship of the Scouting Fleet, flying the flag of Vice Admiral Ashley Robertson.|$|E
