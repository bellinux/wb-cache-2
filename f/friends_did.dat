5|$|Balabushka's {{first job}} {{was as a}} wooden toy {{designer}} and maker, working for the Educational Equipment Company, then located at 71 West 23rd St., in Manhattan, which made building blocks for nurseries and schools. Thereafter he built children's furniture for the Playtime Woodworking Company located on Greenwich Village's Jane Street. While on the job, Balabushka lost his middle finger to a band saw. Using a wooden mold, he made himself a replacement plastic finger of such craftsmanship that even his <b>friends</b> <b>did</b> not realize his loss until long after the incident. As Balabushka's carpentry skills deepened he began building accordions and other detailed carpentry pieces on his own time. In 1949, Balabushka applied for patent on a folding leg bracket mechanism he invented, which was granted in 1951.|$|E
5|$|Louisville's Courier-Journal {{carried an}} {{announcement}} of Blackburn's candidacy for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in Kentucky on February 11, 1878. It {{is not clear}} why, with only meager prior political experience, he decided to seek the office. He may {{have been influenced by}} the members of his family who were involved in politics. His brother Joseph was, at the time, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, and another brother, James, had served in the Kentucky Senate. Two of his wife's brothers also held political office; Samuel Churchill was Secretary of State under Governors John L. Helm, John W. Stevenson, and Preston Leslie, and Thomas Churchill served as treasurer and later {{governor of the state of}} Arkansas. Whatever the reason, even his <b>friends</b> <b>did</b> not believe his announcement was wise due to his political inexperience. He opened his campaign with a speech in Owen County on March 29, 1878.|$|E
25|$|While it {{has been}} {{reported}} that Lorillard's son, Griswold Lorillard, introduced the then-unnamed tuxedo to the United States in 1886 at the Tuxedo Club's Autumn Ball, this is now known to be incorrect. While Griswold and his <b>friends</b> <b>did</b> create a stir by wearing unorthodox clothing, their jackets were closer to tailcoats without tails, or what would now be called a mess jacket.|$|E

25|$|Pallis studied music under Arnold Dolmetsch, the {{distinguished}} reviver of early English music, composer, and performer, {{and was considered}} “one of Dolmetsch's most devoted protégés”. Pallis soon discovered a love of early music—in particular chamber music of {{the sixteenth and seventeenth}} centuries—and for the viola da gamba. Even while climbing in the region of the Satlej-Ganges watershed, he and his musically-minded <b>friends</b> <b>did</b> not fail to bring their instruments.|$|E
25|$|Plot {{lines for}} the later series {{involved}} {{many of the}} familiar DC Comics super-villains that the first incarnation of the Super <b>Friends</b> <b>did</b> not. Instead, like the comic books, they focused on the far-fetched schemes of mad scientists and aliens, who were invariably revealed as being well-intentioned, and simply pursuing their goals through unlawful or disreputable means. Typically, {{at the end of}} each story, a peaceful and reasonable discussion would be performed by the heroes to convince the antagonists to adopt more reasonable methods.|$|E

Students from the Santo Tomas campus who were arrested in the occupations later said that they had been concentrated for defense in the entry lobbies. The military shot at them randomly and some of their <b>friends</b> <b>did</b> not survive.|$|E

25|$|Some legends {{state that}} Virgil, fearing {{that he would}} die before he had {{properly}} revised the poem, gave instructions to friends (including the current emperor, Augustus) that the Aeneid should be burned upon his death, owing to its unfinished state and because {{he had come to}} dislike one of the sequences in Book VIII, in which Venus and Vulcan have sexual intercourse, for its nonconformity to Roman moral virtues. The <b>friends</b> <b>did</b> not comply with Virgil's wishes and Augustus himself ordered that they be disregarded. After minor modifications, the Aeneid was published.|$|E
25|$|Higher {{friendship}} quality directly {{contributes to}} self-esteem, self-confidence, and social development. A World Happiness Database {{study found that}} people with close friendships are happier, although the absolute number of <b>friends</b> <b>did</b> not increase happiness.Other {{studies have suggested that}} children who have friendships of a high quality may be protected against the development of certain disorders, such as anxiety and depression. Conversely, having few friends is associated with dropping out of school, as well as aggression, and adult crime. Peer rejection is also associated with lower later aspiration in the workforce, and participation in social activities, while higher levels of friendship was associated with higher adult self-esteem.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, wearing plain {{dress was}} {{an answer to}} a number of Friends' concerns. Expensive styles were used to show social {{inequality}} and make statements about wealth. Only a select few could afford expensive adornments, which could then be used to exacerbate differences between people based on class, where people in fancy clothing would not want to be seen socializing with others dressed tattily. This was part of the inspiration for the Quaker testimony to equality. In addition, the frequent buying of expensive new styles and discarding what had recently been bought, was considered wasteful and self-seeking, where Friends instead aimed to focus on simplicity, and the important things in life. Notably, <b>Friends</b> <b>did</b> not consider it right to judge people on their material possessions, but this could not be achieved in a society which placed an emphasis on keeping up to date with inconsequential but expensive new trends. At the time, this practice of plainness meant Friends were obviously identifiable.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} year in 1957, Marchant unexpectedly left the sport, {{much to the}} dismay of the cycling community, which believed that he would continue to more success. He switched to playing Australian rules football because that was what his <b>friends</b> <b>did.</b> He felt that fitting in with his friends was more important, saying [...] "I was a funny bloke.

It is very possible that he felt [...] "homeless" [...] during this time and surely {{felt that he was}} in a [...] "limbo... between public and private space". In London, only a few of his works were still being published. However, not everyone viewed Smart's [...] "madness" [...] as problematic, and Johnson defended him, sometimes seriously and sometimes comically, many times. A century later, Robert Browning later remarked that A Song to David was great because Smart was mad, and that the poem allowed him to rank alongside of Milton and Keats. It is no wonder that a few of his loyal <b>friends</b> <b>did</b> come to Mr. Potter's and freed him.|$|E

500|$|Gore {{attended}} college during {{the era of}} anti-Vietnam War protests. Though he was against that war, he disagreed with the tactics of the student protest movement, thinking it silly and juvenile to take anger at the war out on a private university. He and his <b>friends</b> <b>did</b> not participate in Harvard demonstrations. John Tyson, a former roommate, recalled that [...] "We distrusted these movements a lot ... We were a pretty traditional bunch of guys, positive for civil rights and women's rights but formal, transformed by the social revolution to some extent but not buying into something we considered detrimental to our country." [...] Gore helped his father write an anti-war address to the Democratic National Convention of 1968 but stayed with his parents in their hotel room during the violent protests.|$|E
500|$|As {{a lifelong}} believer in nonresistance, Stone could {{not support the}} war effort as so many of her <b>friends</b> <b>did.</b> She could {{certainly}} support the drive to end slavery, however, which the war had made into a realistic possibility. In 1863, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony organized the Women's Loyal National League, the first national women's political organization in the U.S. It collected nearly 400,000 signatures on petitions to abolish slavery in the largest petition drive in the nation's history up to that time. [...] Despite her reduced public activity, Stone agreed to preside over the League's founding convention, and she later agreed to manage its office for two weeks to give Anthony a badly-needed break. [...] She declined, however, to go on lecture tours for the League.|$|E
500|$|Yankovic {{had also}} {{intended}} {{to record a}} parody of the U2 song [...] "Numb" [...] and a parody of The Rembrandts's hit song [...] "I'll Be There for You". The [...] "Numb" [...] spoof would have been called [...] "Green Eggs and Ham", a song in which Yankovic recited various lines from the Dr. Seuss book of the same name. U2 approved the parody, but Yankovic was unable to get permission from the Seuss estate. Likewise, Yankovic had wanted to turn [...] "I'll Be There for You" [...] into [...] "I'll Repair For You", and write it about the popular 1990s sitcom Home Improvement. The Rembrandts had also given approval when Yankovic asked, but the producers of <b>Friends</b> <b>did</b> not want the theme song to get overexposed and refused permission. All of the rejected parodies were later performed in concert.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Kings and Queens" [...] was {{directed}} by Jared Leto under the pseudonym of Bartholomew Cubbins. It was shot the weekend of October 11–13, 2009 in Los Angeles {{over the course of}} several nights, filming some of the city's most iconic landmarks. Leto explained, [...] "I think this city is a beautiful place at night, and we have these empty streets, and it's kind of a haunting, forgotten landscape... very serene." [...] The crew recruited scores of extras and all manner of surrealist street performers to appear in the video. On October 11, 2009, Thirty Seconds to Mars shut down Santa Monica Pier and filmed a segment of the short film along with a group of cyclists. Leto got the inspiration behind the video after some of his <b>friends</b> <b>did</b> Critical Mass and Crank Mob, [...] "groups of riders that get together and kind of reclaim public spaces and take over the streets in several cities around America," [...] and he thought that it would be the perfect backdrop for the music video of [...] "Kings and Queens".|$|E
500|$|Sylvester's boyfriend {{during the}} latter part of the 1960s was a young man named Lonnie Prince; well-built and attractive, many of Sylvester's friends {{described}} the pair as being [...] "the It couple". Sylvester often hitchhiked around town while in female dress; such activity carried a risk of arrest and prosecution, for cross-dressing was then illegal in California. Although avoiding imprisonment for this crime, he was arrested for shoplifting on several occasions. He found work in a variety of different professions, including cooking in McDonald's—where he was fired for refusing to wear a hairnet—cashier at an airport parking garage, working in a hair salon, at a department store, and as a make-up artist at a mortuary, preparing the corpses for their funerals. In the 1960s, the Civil Rights Movement was at its peak, but Sylvester and his <b>friends</b> <b>did</b> not take an active role within it. During the Watts Riots between members of the black community and the predominantly white police force, they joined in with the widespread rioting and looting, stealing wigs, hairspray, and lipstick.|$|E
500|$|Oasis {{played their}} first ever live gig on 18 August 1991 at the Boardwalk club in Manchester. Liam's brother Noel Gallagher, {{who was a}} roadie for Inspiral Carpets, went with the band to watch his younger brother's band play. Whilst Noel and his <b>friends</b> <b>did</b> not think Oasis sounded {{particularly}} spectacular, he did begin {{to consider the possibility}} of using his brother's group as a possible outlet for a series of songs he had been writing for several years. Noel approached the group about joining with the proviso that he would become the band's sole songwriter and leader, and that they would commit to an earnest pursuit of commercial success. [...] "He had loads of stuff written," [...] Arthurs recalled. [...] "When he walked in, we were a band making a racket with four tunes. All of a sudden, there were loads of ideas." [...] Oasis under Noel Gallagher crafted a musical approach that relied on simplicity: with Arthurs and McGuigan restricted to playing barre chords and root bass notes, McCarroll playing basic rhythms, and the band's amplifiers turned up to create distortion, Oasis created a sound [...] "so devoid of finesse and complexity that it came out sounding pretty much unstoppable." ...|$|E
