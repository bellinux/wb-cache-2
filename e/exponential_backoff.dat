40|$|While it is {{well known}} that second order scaling in network traffic can leads to larger {{queueing}} delays, higher drop rates and extended periods of congestion, reducing the scaling exponents has remained an open problem. In this paper we evaluate some techniques to reduce the degree of scaling in TCP traffic, specifically by reducing two related causes: (1) timeouts and <b>exponential</b> <b>backoffs</b> (2) burstiness and ACK compression. We propose a simple modification to the RED algorithm, and show that it can lead to significant reductions in both multi and mono fractal properties of TCP traffic as compared to the currently implemented active and passive buffer management policies. We then evaluate TCP pacing and show that it too can reduce the multi and mono fractal scaling of traffic. We also show that though our techniques are aimed at small time-scale TCP related causes of scaling, it is also effective in reducing the degree of self-similarity in traffic even when application and user level causes are also present, as long as TCP is used as the underlying transport protocol...|$|R

Using a Network Utility Maximization (NUM) formulation, we devise a distributed solution consisting {{of a set of}} sub-algorithms for the different layers of the protocol stack (MAC, flow scheduling and routing), which result from a natural decomposition of the problem into sub-problems. Specifically, we show that: 1) The NUM optimization problem can be solved via duality theory in a distributed way, and 2) the resulting algorithms can be regarded as the CRAHN protocols. These protocols combine back-pressure scheduling with a CSMA-based random access with <b>exponential</b> <b>backoffs.</b> Our theoretical findings are exploited to provide a practical implementation of our algorithms using a common control channel for node coordination and a wireless spectrum sensor network for spectrum sensing. We evaluate our solutions through ns- 2 MIRACLE-based simulations. Our results show that the proposed protocol stack effectively enables multiple flows among cognitive radio nodes to coexist with primary communications. The CRAHN achieves high utilization of the spectrum left unused by the licensed users, while the impact on their communications is limited to an increase of their packet error rate that is below 1 %...|$|R

The number of attempts the CPEs sends their requests to the BS are fixed in IEEE 802. 22 network.

50|$|The {{physical}} medium is accessed through a CSMA/CA protocol. Networks {{which are not}} using beaconing mechanisms utilize an unslotted variation {{which is based on}} the listening of the medium, leveraged by a random <b>exponential</b> <b>backoff</b> algorithm; acknowledgments do not adhere to this discipline. Common data transmission utilizes unallocated slots when beaconing is in use; again, confirmations do not follow the same process.|$|E
50|$|Networks use {{congestion}} control and congestion avoidance techniques {{to try to}} avoid collapse. These include: <b>exponential</b> <b>backoff</b> in protocols such as CSMA/CA in 802.11 and the original Ethernet, window reduction in TCP, and fair queueing in devices such as routers. Another method is to implement priority schemes, transmitting some packets with higher priority than others. A third avoidance method is the explicit allocation of network resources to specific flows through the use of admission control.|$|E
30|$|Figure  11 a, b {{shows the}} {{short-term}} {{fairness of the}} protocols. As the node density increases, the fairness index for all schemes decrease gradually. Notably, the fairness of 802.11 DCF is {{much lower than the}} random channel scheme and N-DCF. This is due to the behavior of <b>exponential</b> random <b>backoff.</b> When a node is caught in a packet collision, its chance of accessing the channel becomes lower because the contention window is doubled. So by reducing packet collisions, short-term fairness can be improved as well as throughput. Fairness of the random channel scheme and N-DCF are similar, because they both reduce contention by distributing contention overhead across channels.|$|R
30|$|Different {{from the}} legacy <b>exponential</b> binary <b>backoff</b> {{algorithm}} {{used in the}} IEEE 802.16 standard, in this paper, we propose two pragmatic adaptive algorithms, namely, semi-dynamic and quasi-dynamic contention resolution scheme, that allow the base station to adjust its backoff window size based on current channel status. Through extensive simulations, we have demonstrated quantitatively the effectiveness of both proposed schemes. Furthermore, the given {{results show that the}} quasi-dynamic scheme can achieve better performance than the semi-dynamic scheme in most cases. However, in order to acquire sufficient knowledge of the current channel status, the quasi-dynamic scheme tends to be more computationally complex compared to the semi-dynamic scheme.|$|R
40|$|TCP is {{the most}} widely used {{transport}} layer protocol. However, it was designed for wired networks and suffers performance degradation in error-prone wireless networks. When multiple error losses occur in the same window, existing NewReno-based TCP variants need one RTT to retransmit each lost packet, an inefficient recover strategy. <b>Exponential</b> retransmit <b>backoff</b> and frequent window reduction also lead to TCP performance degradation. In this paper we propose three end-to-end, sender-side-only changes, collectively called as Bulk Repeat (BR), to improve TCP performance in the presence of heavy errors. An analytic model is developed and validated with the Ns- 2 simulator. We implement TCP BR changes on top of TCP Westwood (TCPW) in Ns- 2 and study its throughput performance as well as fairness and friendliness via simulations. Results show that TCP BR can improve TCP performance up to an order of magnitude in error-prone wireless networks...|$|R
50|$|Node D is {{unaware of}} the ongoing data {{transfer}} between node A and node B. Node D has data to send to node C, {{which is in the}} transmission range of node D. D initiates the process by sending an RTS frame to node C. Node C has already deferred its transmission until the completion of the current data transfer between node A and node B (to avoid co-channel interference at node B). Hence, even though it receives RTS from node D, it does not reply back with CTS. Node D assumes that its RTS was not successful because of collision and hence proceeds to back off (using an <b>exponential</b> <b>backoff</b> algorithm).|$|E
5000|$|Transmission: if {{the medium}} was {{identified}} as being clear or the node received a CTS to explicitly indicate it can send, it sends the frame in its entirety. Unlike CSMA/CD, it is very challenging for a wireless node to listen {{at the same time}} as it transmits (its transmission will dwarf any attempt to listen). Continuing the wireless example, the node awaits receipt of an acknowledgement packet from the Access Point to indicate the packet was received and checksummed correctly. If such acknowledgement does not arrive in a timely manner, it assumes the packet collided with some other transmission, causing the node to enter a period of binary <b>exponential</b> <b>backoff</b> prior to attempting to re-transmit.|$|E
5000|$|This {{example is}} from the Ethernet protocol, where a sending host is able to know when a {{collision}} has occurred (that is, another host has tried to transmit), when it is sending a frame. If both hosts attempted to re-transmit {{as soon as a}} collision occurred, there would be yet another collision [...] - [...] and the pattern would continue forever. The hosts must choose a random value within an acceptable range to ensure that this situation doesn't happen. An <b>exponential</b> <b>backoff</b> algorithm is therefore used. The figure 51.2μs is used as an example here because it is the slot time for a 10 Mbit/s Ethernet line (see Slot time). However, 51.2μs could be replaced by any positive value, in practice.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, a Two Windows MAC Algorithm (TWMA) is {{proposed}} and extensive simulation studies compare the proposed medium access algorithm and IEEE 802. 11 standard. TWMA is introduced {{to solve the}} fairness problem in medium access and improve the utilization of the channel i. e. throughput, traffic delay, and fairness of medium access algorithm mainly in wireless ad hoc networks using Carrier-Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA). The media access control (MAC) protocol plays {{a critical role in}} providing fairness, efficiency, and robustness in wireless networks. IEEE 802. 11 MAC using <b>exponential</b> random <b>backoff</b> algorithm can not solve such fairness problem, i. e. stations cannot gain fair access to the shared wireless medium, due to non-homogeneous traffic load distribution, location dependent contention for medium access, and lack of central administration in ad hoc networks. The proposed MAC algorithm uses a variable Channel Status Indicator (CSI) to represent adjacent traffic status and two windows contention algorithm in order to achieve better throughput, latency, and a degree of fairness. Simulation results show the performance characteristics and functionalities of the algorithm that includes throughput, latency, buffer overflow, and etc. The simulation results reveal that the proposed TWMA achieve higher throughput and lower latency than that of the IEEE 802. 11 standards MAC algorithm...|$|R
50|$|Modern {{networks}} use {{congestion control}} and congestion avoidance techniques {{to try to}} avoid congestion collapse. These include: <b>exponential</b> <b>backoff</b> in protocols such as 802.11's CSMA/CA and the original Ethernet, window reduction in TCP, and fair queueing in devices such as routers. Another method to avoid the negative effects of network congestion is implementing priority schemes, so that some packets are transmitted with higher priority than others. Priority schemes do not solve network congestion by themselves, but they help to alleviate the effects of congestion for some services. An example of this is 802.1p. A third method to avoid network congestion is the explicit allocation of network resources to specific flows. One example of this is the use of Contention-Free Transmission Opportunities (CFTXOPs) in the ITU-T G.hn standard, which provides high-speed (up to 1 Gbit/s) Local area networking over existing home wires (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables).|$|E
5000|$|The new TCP/IP stack also {{supports}} Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to keep throughput hit due to network congestion {{as low as}} possible. Without ECN, a TCP message segment is dropped by some router when its buffer is full. Hosts get no notice of building congestion until packets start being dropped. The sender detects the segment did not reach the destination; but {{due to lack of}} feedback from the congested router, it has no information on the extent of reduction in transmission rate it needs to make. Standard TCP implementations detect this drop when they time out waiting for acknowledgement from the receiver. The sender then reduces the size of its congestion window, which is the limit on the amount of data in flight at any time. Multiple packet drops can even result in a reset of the congestion window, to TCP's Maximum Segment Size, and a TCP Slow Start. <b>Exponential</b> <b>backoff</b> and only additive increase produce stable network behaviour, letting routers recover from congestion. However, the dropping of packets has noticeable impacts on time-sensitive streams like streaming media, because it takes time for the drop to be noticed and retransmitted. With ECN support enabled, the router sets two bits in the data packets that indicate to the receiver it is experiencing congestion (but not yet fully choked). The receiver in turn lets the sender know that a router is facing congestion and then the sender lowers its transmission rate by some amount. If the router is still congested, it will set the bits again, and eventually the sender will slow down even more. The advantage of this approach is that the router does not get full enough to drop packets, and thus the sender does not have to lower the transmission rate significantly to cause serious delays in time-sensitive streams; nor does it risk severe under-utilization of bandwidth. Without ECN, the only way routers can tell hosts anything is by dropping packets. ECN is like Random Early Drop, except that the packets are marked instead of dropped. The only caveat is that both sender and receiver, as well as all intermediate routers, have to be ECN-friendly. Any router along the way can prevent the use of ECN if it considers ECN-marked packets invalid and drops them (or more typically the whole connection setup fails because of a piece of network equipment that drops connection setup packets with ECN flags set). Routers that don't know about ECN can still drop packets normally, but there is some ECN-hostile network equipment on the Internet. For this reason, ECN is disabled by default. It can be enabled via the [...] command.|$|E

40|$|The ISM free-licence band {{is highly}} used by {{wireless}} technologies such IEEE 802. 11, Bluetooth {{as well as}} additional private wireless schemes. This huge utilization increases dramatically the interferences (high Bit Error Rate) leading to lowering the reliability of such networks.
