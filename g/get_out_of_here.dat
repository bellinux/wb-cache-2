5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and happiness... it's me looking at happiness {{in a negative way}} because I've always been... kind of afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't be able to be an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do I do this and <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>here</b> and get happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool because {{at the end of the}} song I say 'I'm going to let it go', like I am going to be happy.|$|E

500|$|As {{with the}} ISKCON-inspired [...] "Awaiting on You All", Allison views the {{conditions}} that Harrison imposes in the song's choruses as a rare exception within the singer's work. Elsewhere, Allison continues, Harrison's songwriting reveals [...] "a strong belief in the efficacy of unmerited divine grace". In a 1982 interview, Harrison described his statement on God rewarding those who first look to God as a [...] "flexible" [...] one, adding: [...] "In one way, I'm never going to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>here</b> [...] unless it's by His grace, but then again â€¦ he amount of grace I would expect from God should be equal {{to the amount of}} grace I can gather or earn." ...|$|E

[...] Three telephone linemen working near Bath testified that Kehoe passed them on the road toward the school, and they saw him arrive there.

500|$|..... {{we turned}} off the dusty French road, through a gateway and into a meadow beside the {{buildings}} of a farm. I saw {{with one of the}} nastiest feelings I have ever had in my life two heavy machine guns inside the meadow ... pointing at the head of our column. The guns began to spit fire ... for a few seconds the cries and shrieks of our stricken men drowned the crackling of the guns. Men fell like grass before a scythe ... I felt a searing pain and pitched forward ... my scream of pain mingled with the cries of my mates, but even before I fell into the heap of dying men, the thought stabbed my brain 'If I ever <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>here,</b> the swine that did this will pay for it.' ...|$|E
500|$|Christian Louboutin {{said that}} he would {{dedicate}} his time to creating some [...] "scene-stealing designs for the single's video", out of his appreciation for the song. According to Rap-Up, Lopez was scheduled to film the music video for the song in January 2010. She outlined the concept of the video in a radio interview, where she said: [...] "It's gonna be a lot of dancing, I definitely want to do some dancing because it's been a while and I want to do a dance video, and it's going to be really empowering. It's going to be about that woman, you know when you have that moment when you realize you have to really <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>here</b> that's the moment we're trying to cauterize in the video.

500|$|According to Experience bassist Noel Redding, Hendrix {{told him}} it was about Hendrix's girlfriend in high school, Betty Jean Morgan. [...] Jimi's brother, Leon Hendrix, also felt that it was about Betty Jean, but also {{included}} her sister Maddy, although their house was brown. Shadwick suggests that the song was inspired by Linda Keith, Keith Richards' then-girlfriend and early Hendrix supporter. [...] Keith referred to her friend's Manhattan apartment, with its red velvet walls and decor, as the [...] "red house", and the two frequently stayed there during the summer of 1966. In London in 1970, Hendrix met up with Keith and when he performed [...] "Red House" [...] at the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival, he dedicated the song to her and added [...] "I got to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>here,</b> because my Linda don't live here no more" [...] to the lyrics. However, Billy Cox, longtime friend and bassist for Hendrix's post-Experience groups, explained, [...] "As far as I know, 'Red House' didn't have any significance in reference to a particular person, place or thing. [...] It was just a blues number that Jimi put together".|$|E

500|$|Thirty-five {{seconds after}} the first Mayday call, the crew made another transmission. Homer shouted, [...] "Mayday! Mayday! <b>Get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>here!</b> Mayday! Get out of here!" [...] The flight {{suddenly}} dropped [...] in half a minute before the hijackers managed to stabilize the aircraft. The exact time at which Flight93 came under the hijackers' control cannot be determined. Officials believe that at 09:28, the hijackers assaulted the cockpit and moved the passengers {{to the rear of}} the plane at the same time to minimize any chance of either the crew or the passengers interfering with the attack. While the other hijacked flights were taken by five-man teams, Flight93 had only four hijackers, leading to speculation of a possible 20th hijacker. The 9/11 Commission believed that Mohammed al-Qahtani was the likely candidate for this role, but was unable to participate as he had been denied entry into the United States one month earlier. With many passengers saying in phone calls that they saw only three hijackers, the 9/11 Commission believed Jarrah remained seated until the crew were overpowered and passengers were moved to the back of the aircraft and then took over the flight controls out of sight of the passengers.|$|E

Brown, who was in the parking lot smoking a cigarette, was surprised to see Harris, whom he had earlier noted had been absent from an important class test.

Brown had severed his friendship with Harris a year earlier because Harris had thrown a chunk of ice at his car windshield; Brown patched things up with Harris just prior to the shooting. Brown scolded Harris for skipping the morning class, because Harris was always serious about schoolwork and being on time. Harris reportedly said, [...] "It doesn't matter anymore" [...] and also said, [...] "Brooks, I like you now. <b>Get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>here.</b> Go home."
