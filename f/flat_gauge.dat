The response action evaluated on certain manifolds, with appropriate choice of background gauge field, defines a set of SPT topological invariants. Further, SPTs can be gauged by summing over all isomorphism classes of <b>flat</b> G <b>gauge</b> fields to obtain Dijkgraaf-Witten topological G gauge theories. These topological gauge theories can be ungauged by first introducing and then proliferating defects that spoils the gauge symmetry. This mechanism is related to anyon condensation in 2 + 1 d and condensing bosonic gauge charges in 3 + 1 d. In the dual boundary approach, we study 1 + 1 d and 2 + 1 d quantum field theories that have G 't-Hooft anomalies that can be precisely cancelled by (the response theory of) the corresponding bulk SPT.

In this model, solutions to the classical equations of motion for A_μ and A̅_μ are non-flat due to the interactions with matter fields. The solutions for the gauge fields can, however, be split into two parts, <b>flat</b> <b>gauge</b> fields A_μ, A̅_μ, and those terms that depend on the matter fields. The equations for the matter fields then coincide with covariantly-constancy equations in the flat backgrounds A_μ and A̅_μ, which are exactly the same as those in linearized 3 d Vasiliev gravity. The two- and three-point correlation functions of operators in the boundary CFT are computed by using an on-shell action, tr (B_ϕρ C).

This shows that Kitaev models are a special case of the older and more general combinatorial models. This equivalence is an analogue of the relation between Turaev-Viro and Reshetikhin-Turaev TQFTs and relates them to the quantisation of moduli spaces of flat connections. We show that the topological invariants of the two models, the algebra of operators acting on the protected space of the Kitaev model and the quantum moduli algebra from the combinatorial quantisation formalism, are isomorphic. This is established in a gauge theoretical picture, in which both models appear as Hopf algebra valued lattice gauge theories. We first prove that the triangle operators of a Kitaev model form a module algebra over a Hopf algebra of gauge transformations and that this module algebra is isomorphic to the lattice algebra in the combinatorial formalism. Both algebras can be viewed as the algebra of functions on gauge fields in a Hopf algebra gauge theory. The isomorphism between them induces an algebra isomorphism between their subalgebras of invariants, which are interpreted as gauge invariant functions or observables. It also relates the curvatures in the two models, which are given as holonomies around the faces of the lattice. This yields an isomorphism between the subalgebras obtained by projecting out curvatures, which can be viewed as the algebras of functions on <b>flat</b> <b>gauge</b> fields and are the topological invariants of the two models.
