500|$|McCartney has {{publicly}} professed support for Everton, and also shown favour for Liverpool. In 2008, he ended speculation about his allegiance when he said, [...] "Here's the deal: {{my father was}} born in Everton, my family are officially Evertonians, so if {{it comes down to}} a derby match or an FA Cup final between the two, I would have to support Everton. But after a concert at Wembley Arena I got a bit of a friendship with Kenny Dalglish, who had been to the gig and I thought 'You know what? <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> going to support them both because it's all Liverpool.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In October 2008, Horsfield was {{diagnosed}} with testicular cancer, and advised that his playing career was over. As the disease was discovered in its early stages, no chemotherapy or radiotherapy was needed, surgery proved successful and {{less than two months}} later he was given the all-clear. Horsfield decided to make his illness public to help spread awareness of the disease, and lent his support to a Premier League-backed project launched in 2009 to promote men's health issues. He said: [...] "Getting cancer was something I had to get over. I got it, wanted to beat it and I did. Now <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> glad that I've got another chance in football." ...|$|E

500|$|... « Toccata »: In this introduction, we are {{introduced}} to the narrator, and discover how he has ended up in France after the war. He {{is the director of}} a lace factory, has a wife, children, and grandchildren, though he has no real affection for his family and continues his homosexual encounters when he travels on business. He hints of an incestuous love, which we learn later was for his twin sister. He explains that he has decided to write about his experiences during the war for his own benefit and not as an attempt to justify himself. He closes the introduction by saying, [...] "I live, I do what can be done, it's the same for everyone, I am a man like other men, I am a man like you. I tell you <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> like you!" ...|$|E
500|$|I Am... World Tour was produced, directed, {{and edited}} by Beyoncé {{for her own}} {{production}} company Parkwood Pictures. It contains tour footage from 108 shows {{that took place in}} 78 cities, 32 countries, and 6 continents in the presence of 1.1 million fans around the world. The show is a combination of performance clips from the tour, as well as backstage moments. I Am... World Tour also serves as the directorial debut for Beyoncé. On this occasion, she confessed that {{it was a lot of}} work for her. Nevertheless, she was very happy and eager for her fans to see her DVD directed by herself. She explained, [...] "I'm so excited – this is my directorial debut. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> thrilled that my fans are going to be in the theatre with me and I can't wait for everyone to see it. It took me nine months to edit because I wanted to show a little bit of each show, each performance on tour, and it was 116 shows, so you can only imagine how much work it was, [...] it was worth it." [...] At the New York City screening of the DVD, Beyoncé further explained that she was completely [...] "hands-on", deciding which moments made the final cut and which ones wound up on the cutting-room floor, stating, [...] "It was hard work. I learned so much. I have a new respect for directors and I think I would like to do more of it." [...] Some of the behind-the-scenes footage were shot by Beyoncé on her laptop. The DVD captures concert footage from cities in Europe, Asia, South America, and the United States, all edited into one concert. However, I Am... World Tour was significantly recorded at London's larger O2 Arena, a few months after the I Am... Yours concert. A live CD of the concert, a behind-the-scenes documentary of her life along the tour and a 20-page book of exclusive photos are all included in the package. According to a press release, [...] "it is meant to create the ne plus ultra Knowles concert experience, seen from her perspective".|$|E

2500|$|About {{adjusting}} to the NFL, Ringer said [...] "It's definitely {{a lot more complicated}} than in college, definitely. But mainly it's just the play calling, it's a lot longer than what it was in college, but all-in-all it's just learning a whole new terminology, some things are similar, but it's the words that they use are different. So it's all about adjustment. A lot of intelligence out there, they don't make mistakes. They are pretty mature on what they are doing. I am trying to build up to that, because {{a lot of them are}} veterans and have been there for a while. They understand what is going on, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> trying to keep up and not make them look bad." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{the day of}} the 1992 {{election}} MacKenzie {{used the}} front-page headline [...] "If Kinnock Wins Today, Will The Last Person To Leave Britain Please Turn Out The Lights", accompanied by a picture of Kinnock's head superimposed over a lightbulb. While the paper initially supported the government of John Major, because it appeared that Major himself shared the ideological hostility of Thatcher towards European integration, this soon changed. Following the UK's forced exit from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism on Black Wednesday in September 1992, according to MacKenzie, Major telephoned him to ask about how the paper would report the story. While Major has denied the conversation ever took place, MacKenzie has claimed his response was: [...] "Prime Minister, I have on my desk in front of me a very large bucket of shit which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> about to pour all over you." ...|$|E
