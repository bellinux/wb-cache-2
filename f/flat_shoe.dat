5000|$|Arefeh Mansouri is the {{youngest}} Iranian-American Inventor to be granted a US Patent for her new twist on the classic <b>flat</b> <b>shoe.</b> FLAT PLAT is an innovation in the <b>flat</b> <b>shoe</b> market that uses a proprietary outsole that is engineered for maximum comfort and support, which has never been felt in the typical <b>flat</b> <b>shoe.</b> The shoe was developed with the guidance of a Neuro-Interventional Pain Specialist and on May 5, 2015 Arefeh Mansouri was awarded a US Patent for her invention.To test the final product, an initial high end and very limited run of the shoes were made in Italy with exotic materials and sold in Arefeh's Worth Avenue store in Palm Beach. The shoes were an instant hit with her clientele, who wanted more. Due to this high demand Arefeh Mansouri has decided to manufacture FLAT PLAT But this time FLAT PLAT will be more accessible while retaining its quality.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Kinesiology, 2013 Embargoed for {{two years}} from date added to Humboldt Digital Scholar (2013 - 05 - 21). Released from embargo May 22, 2015. An ever-growing {{population}} of {{people are looking for}} ways to increase calorie burn without increasing activity levels. People in the shoe industry have capitalized on this concept and created curved bottom shoes. Curved bottom shoes are believed to provide the body with an unstable walking surface, initiating greater muscle activity patterns to stabilize the body, ultimately resulting in an increase in the metabolic cost of walking in curved shoes. The metabolic cost of walking is also determined in part by the exchange of mechanical energy and the cost of swinging the legs. However, it is unclear how walking in curved shoes may affect the pendulum like exchange of mechanical energy in the body and the cost of leg swing. This study investigated the effects of curved bottom shoes on the energetics and mechanics of walking. Sixteen subjects came to the Humboldt State Biomechanics Lab for two testing sessions. They walked on a treadmill and overground at three different speeds (0. 75, 1. 25, 1. 75 m/s) and in three different <b>shoes</b> (<b>flat</b> <b>shoes</b> (FS), curved <b>shoes</b> (CS), and <b>flat</b> <b>shoes</b> weighted to match the weight of curved shoes (WFS)). The metabolic cost of walking was greater in curved bottom shoes compared to the <b>flat</b> <b>shoes</b> (p=. 0001) but similar to weighted <b>flat</b> <b>shoes</b> (p=. 386). However, inverted pendulum energy exchange was greater in curved shoes when compared to both <b>flat</b> <b>shoes</b> (p<. 0001) and weighted <b>flat</b> <b>shoes</b> (p=. 001). In conclusion, walking in curved shoes allows for a greater exchange of mechanical energy via inverted pendulum mechanics but increases the metabolic cost as compared to walking in <b>flat</b> <b>shoes</b> likely as a result of an increased cost of leg swing...|$|R

5000|$|Frictional brakes {{are most}} common and can be divided broadly into [...] "shoe" [...] or [...] "pad" [...] brakes, using an {{explicit}} wear surface, and hydrodynamic brakes, such as parachutes, which use friction in a working fluid and do not explicitly wear. Typically the term [...] "friction brake" [...] is used to mean pad/shoe brakes and excludes hydrodynamic brakes, even though hydrodynamic brakes use friction. Friction (pad/shoe) brakes are often rotating devices with a stationary pad and a rotating wear surface. Common configurations include shoes that contract to rub {{on the outside of}} a rotating drum, such as a band brake; a rotating drum with shoes that expand to rub the inside of a drum, commonly called a [...] "drum brake", although other drum configurations are possible; and pads that pinch a rotating disc, commonly called a [...] "disc brake". Other brake configurations are used, but less often. For example, PCC trolley brakes include a <b>flat</b> <b>shoe</b> which is clamped to the rail with an electromagnet; the Murphy brake pinches a rotating drum, and the Ausco Lambert disc brake uses a hollow disc (two parallel discs with a structural bridge) with shoes that sit between the disc surfaces and expand laterally.|$|E
40|$|Summary Reasons for {{performing}} study: Overload injuries in sport horses commonly occur. Shoeing techniques {{are believed to}} be important to prevent these injuries. It has been demonstrated that roller-toed shoes ease the process of breakover in front feet and decrease the loading of lesion prone structures of the distal limb. Considering the similar functional anatomy of distal forelimb and hind limb segments, the same effect could be expected in hind feet, but this has not been proven yet. Objectives: To test the effect of roller-toed shoes on the breakover process in hind feet. Methods: Four clinically sound Warmblood horses were trotted by hand over a track containing a pressure measuring system. The horses were randomly shod with three types of shoes, a standard <b>flat</b> <b>shoe</b> and two roller-toed shoes with a mild en full rounding in the entire toe part respectively. Between the measurements the horses had 2 or 3 days to adapt to the shoes. Variables representative of temporal gait characteristics, loading characteristics and descriptives for the hoof-unrollment pattern were used for statistical analyses. Results: Hoof placement and the temporal characteristics such as total stance time and breakover duration did not change significantly. Both roller-toed shoes increased the ease of movement during breakover due to a more gradual and smooth hoof-unrollment pattern. The effect was larger in the full roller-toed shoe compared with the <b>flat</b> <b>shoe,</b> than in the mild roller-toed shoe. Furthermore the roller-toed shoes changed the hoof-unrollment pattern to the lateral side. Conclusions: Roller-toed shoes increased the ease of movement during breakover in hind feet, which improves the coordination of this process and lowers the peak loading of the distal limb during this process. Potential relevance: This pilot study showed that roller-toed shoes have a similar effect on the kinetics of breakover in hind feet as has been demonstrated in front feet. Considering the functional and kinematic differences between forelimbs and hind limbs, further research will be necessary to demonstrate that the use of roller-toed shoes is relevant in hind feet...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} how the height and material of in-shoe heel lifts affect plantar pressure and center of pressure (COP) trajectory in the medial-lateral direction during walking. Seventeen healthy young male adults were asked to walk along an 8 m walkway while wearing a high-cut <b>flat</b> <b>shoe</b> and 5 different heel lifts. Peak pressure (PP), pressure-time integral (PTI) and contact area (CA) were measured by Pedar insole system for three foot regions: forefoot, midfoot and heel. Range and velocity of medial-lateral (ML) COP during forefoot contact phase (FFCP) and foot flat phase (FFP) were collected using Footscan pressure plate. Forefoot pressure and ML-COP parameters increased as the heel was elevated. Statistically significant attenuation of heel peak plantar pressure was provided by all heel lifts except for the hard lift. Post hoc tests suggest that material had a greater influence on the range and velocity of ML-COP during FFCP than heel height, while during FFP, heel height seemed to affect these parameters more. The findings from this study suggest that thick heel lifts should be used with caution, and that a heel lift made of materials with good support and elastic properties might be more appropriate to improve footwear comfort and medial-lateral motion control. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The goal on this {{investigation}} {{was to develop a}} detachable high heel shoe construction that could enter the current high heel market. The impact of high heel shoes on women's fashion is enormous but there are associated issues of comfort and health with these shoes. This work aims to maintain the appealing aspects of a high heel shoe while adding a concealed mechanism to enable the heel to be easily removed to convert the shoe into a flat at the discretion of the user. The current solutions and products in the nearly 7 billion dollar a year women's shoe market are minimal. The prior arts of detachable heels fail to develop a simple comprehensive detachable high heel that can enter the market. A feasible and complete design that takes into account arch stiffness, heel removal, styling, and manufacturability is the goal of this work. This investigation deconstructed high heel shoes to learn and leverage the current high heel shoe infrastructure as a basis for adapting the shoe into a detachable high heel shoe construction. Three prototypes of the detachable high heel shoe were developed with a shoe assembly that consisted of a modified insole and a detachable heel that consisted of a dovetailed aluminum shank fastened to a high heel. (cont.) The prototypes were able to display the ability for the detachable high heel to maintain high heel stability, styling that is consistent with the industry, ease of use, a <b>flat</b> <b>shoe</b> and other critical functional requirements identified in the work. The construction was consistent with the current industry high heel infrastructure. The development of the detachable high heel construction displays the feasibility of such a product in a market where none exist. The detachable high heel construction needs further refinement and optimization to complete a design that is ready to enter this exciting market. by Alfredo Louis Morales. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from June 20, 2014 - June 20, 2015 Much {{research has been conducted}} to determine the difference between running barefoot verse the traditional heel strike running style. Each style of running requires parts of the foot to strike the ground differently. Shoe companies have addressed these differences by designing different styles of shoes for each running style. This study looked to evaluate the design criteria of running shoes, to see if the current criteria are appropriate so that the shoe emulates the biomechanics of running. To do this a content analysis of running shoe reviews was done on a neutral, stability, minimalist, and racing <b>flat</b> <b>shoe.</b> This information was then compared to the biomechanics of barefoot running to see what design criteria were needed to emulate barefoot running. The design framework for this study was reverse engineering. This concept relies on understanding the product, and the needs or problems which each component in the product meets. The idea is to find the components which are most successful in order to use those components to design another product which has similar needs. Data were collected that allowed the researcher to define the problem that needed to be solved. This was done in the form of analyzing blog reviews of male runners. Blogs were read and coded to evaluate what male runners thought about the characteristics of neutral, stability, minimalist, and racing flat shoes that are currently on the market. It was assumed that runners {{would be more likely to}} express their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with a particular shoe in blog as opposed to a survey. Physical requirements were defined using the information collected from the blogs along with consideration of the biomechanics of barefoot running information that was found during the review of literature. Once physical requirements were defined, market research was done to see if there was currently a shoe being sold that had all of the requirements defined by the study. Finally the final shoe criteria was evaluated to be sure that it solved the problems determined from the blog data. The success of this study provides a method by which shoe manufactures can use publicly available information to develop design criteria, based on current user needs...|$|E
40|$|Anterior {{knee pain}} (AKP) is a common, chronic lower limb {{musculoskeletal}} overuse condition that represents substantial morbidity to those affected, {{and has a}} significant impact on the health care industry. Health practitioners frequently prescribe foot orthoses in the management of AKP as an alternative or adjunct to multimodal physiotherapy. The primary aim of this thesis was to investigate the clinical efficacy of foot orthoses in AKP, utilising high-quality research methodologies. The two systematic reviews conducted have identified a significant gap in the literature regarding evidence from randomised clinical trials (RCTs) for foot orthoses in AKP and other lower limb overuse conditions. While the best evidence for AKP management was for multimodal physiotherapy, there was insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of foot orthoses in the treatment of lower limb overuse conditions, including AKP. Meta-analysis provided evidence to support the use of foot orthoses in the prevention of the first incidence of lower limb overuse conditions. An interesting finding was evidence from pooled and individual study data of no difference between custom and prefabricated foot orthoses in both treatment and prevention of lower limb overuse conditions, inferring that either type of orthosis may be utilised. Both systematic reviews highlighted substantial methodological flaws of the included studies, and recommended that future studies include larger participant numbers, longer participant follow-up, more consistent use of reliable and valid outcome measures and reporting of outcome data, and utilisation of the CONSORT guidelines in the design and reporting of RCTs. A 12 -month prospective RCT investigated the short- and long-term clinical efficacy of prefabricated foot orthoses in the treatment of 179 participants with AKP. Foot orthoses were more effective than <b>flat</b> <b>shoe</b> inserts in the short term, implying that their contoured form has some therapeutic effect. Foot orthoses were not significantly different to multimodal physiotherapy over 12 months, nor was there any benefit in adding foot orthoses to physiotherapy. Considering that all groups experienced clinically meaningful long-term improvements in pain and function, clinicians may prescribe foot orthoses for AKP to hasten recovery. Findings of post-hoc analyses to develop a clinical prediction rule indicate that those of older age and shorter height, who have a lower severity of AKP and a more mobile midfoot, are more than twice as likely to experience a successful outcome with foot orthoses. As a secondary aim, this thesis has provided a more comprehensive profile of AKP as a condition. Baseline data from the RCT participants confirms previous reports of higher rates of AKP in females, and a tendency towards bilaterality and chronicity. This AKP sample did not differ from asymptomatic individuals in terms of body mass index, physical activity level, general and mental health, and foot posture, although they tended to have a more mobile foot under load. These characteristics tend to be homogenous across a number of published RCTs, indicating that the findings of the RCT described above are likely to be generalisable to the broader population with AKP. An additional finding in this group was that those with AKP of long duration, higher pain levels, lower functional levels, and an overall lower score on a specific measure of AKP have a poorer prognosis over 12 months, irrespective of their age, gender or morphometry. These findings suggest that, in order to improve prognosis and the chance of a successful outcome, the primary goals of intervention should be to reduce the severity and duration of AKP, through the use of early intervention with foot orthoses, multimodal physiotherapy, or a combination of the two...|$|E
