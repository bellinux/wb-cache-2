40|$|This study {{examines}} whether the mandatory adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in the European Union significantly improves <b>information</b> <b>comparability</b> in 17 European countries. We employ three proxies—the similarity of accounting functions that translate economic events into accounting data, {{the degree of}} information transfer, and the similarity of the information content of earnings and of the book value of equity—to measure <b>information</b> <b>comparability.</b> Our results suggest that mandatory IFRS adoption improves cross-country <b>information</b> <b>comparability</b> by making similar things look more alike without making different things look less different. Our results also suggest that both accounting convergence and higher quality information under IFRS are the likely drivers of the comparability improvement. In addition, we find some evidence that cross-country comparability improvement is affected by firms’ institutional environment...|$|E
40|$|Demand for internationally {{comparable}} {{accounting information}} has increased significantly {{in recent years}} due to rapid growth in cross-border investment. One reflection of this trend is the widespread adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), a set of accounting rules designed to improve financial reporting quality, including comparability. In this thesis, I empirically test whether IFRS adoption improves cross-border <b>information</b> <b>comparability</b> and whether the improvement in the <b>information</b> <b>comparability,</b> if any, facilitates international investment such as mergers and acquisitions (M&As). In {{the first part of}} the thesis, I use data from 17 European countries that adopted IFRS in 2005 to investigate the effect of IFRS adoption on <b>information</b> <b>comparability.</b> I employ three proxies [...] -the similarity of accounting functions, the degree of cross-border intra-industry information transfer, and the similarity of the information content of earnings and book value [...] -to measure cross-border <b>information</b> <b>comparability.</b> I find that all three measures of <b>information</b> <b>comparability</b> indicate significantly better comparability in the post-IFRS period than in the pre-IFRS period. I also find that the improvement in comparability resulting from IFRS adoption is more evident among countries with similar institutional environments than among those with different institutional environments. In the second part of the thesis, I examine whether the adoption of IFRS would encourage cross-border M&As. Using data from firms in 17 European countries with mandatory IFRS adoption in 2005, I calculate the frequency that a firm acquires/ merges with a foreign firm, the number of foreign bidders involved in an M&A deal, and the synergistic gains of cross-border M&As. I find that all three measures increase significantly after the mandatory IFRS adoption. These results suggest that IFRS adoption facilitates and create more value for cross-border M&As.

40|$|Author's pre-print version. Final version {{published}} in Contemporary Accounting Research. Available online at [URL] examine {{the effect of}} mandatory International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) adoption on firms’ information environment. We find that after mandatory IFRS adoption consensus forecast errors decrease for firms that mandatorily adopt IFRS relative to forecast errors of other firms. We also find decreasing forecast errors for voluntary adopters, but this effect is smaller and not robust. Moreover, we show that the magnitude of the forecast errors decrease is associated with the firm-specific differences between local GAAP and IFRS. Exploiting individual analyst level data and isolating settings where investors would benefit more from either increased comparability or higher quality information, we document that the improvement in the information environment is driven both by <b>information</b> and <b>comparability</b> effects. These results are robust to variations in the measurement of information environment quality, forecast horizon, sample composition and tests of earnings management...|$|R
40|$|Globalization {{has led to}} {{the growth}} of {{international}} financial markets, as one of the results, the EU adopted IFRS in 2005 to meet the need of accounting globalization and harmonization. This action has triggered a debate about whether the adoption of IFRS is beneficial to accounting quality and <b>information</b> <b>comparability.</b> Meanwhile, China, playing {{a key role in the}} global economic development stage, realizes the importance of accounting harmonization and attempts to move towards the IFRS as well. However, to reach the goal that the Chinese companies produce financial statements that are the same as those that apply IFRS, there is still a long way to go. The purpose of this thesis is to examine whether the adoption of IFRS by EU has enhanced the quality of financial reporting and accounting <b>information</b> <b>comparability.</b> Additionally, the thesis further identified the seminal undertakings for the convergence of IFRS in Europe and pointed out the implication for China’s convergence with IFRS. The empirical findings in this thesis were obtained through qualitative interviews. The empirical findings suggest that accounting quality and <b>information</b> <b>comparability</b> has been enhanced with EU’s strong and full enforcement with IFRS. With the confidence in IFRS which is gained from the success of the EU’s adoption of IFRS, a coherent result was found that the convergence towards IFRS would also benefit China in accounting quality and <b>information</b> <b>comparability,</b> and further lead to more international investments. However, when it comes to the question whether China should emulate EU’s example to adopt IFRS directly or keep CAS (Chinese Accounting Standards) which is similar to IFRS, two mixed opinions were obtained basically from Europe side and China side. Through in-depth analysis with these empirical findings, the conclusion is that it is necessary for China to take steps to build intensive programs to enhance its capacity of the adoption of IFRS, so that it could adapt itself to the fact that the IFRS is already making its way around the world as a single set of high quality global accounting standards. ...|$|E

Thus, corporate governance emerges as a tool for the company to comply with its social responsibility by providing more reliable information to all its stakeholders. In addition, one of the main features is the knowledge society, which is the availability of information and communication technologies (ICT). Consequently, the reliability of the financial information that companies disseminate over the Internet is relevant, assuming a good example of transparency takes place.

40|$|Purpose: The main {{objective}} of this paper analyses the effects of mandatory International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adoption by Spanish firms in 2005 {{on the cost of}} equity capital. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of listed Spanish companies during the 1999 to 2009 period and a country-level focused analysis. To achieve our objective we relied on OLS regression analysis and estimate the dependent variable – the cost of equity – by using the proxy suggested in Easton (2004). Findings: We find evidence that, unlike previous studies, Spanish listed companies show a significant reduction in their cost of equity capital after the mandatory adoption of IFRS in 2005, after controlling by a set of firm-risk and market variables. According to our results, increased financial disclosure and enhanced <b>information</b> <b>comparability,</b> along with changes in legal and institutional enforcement, seem to have a joint effect on the cost of capital, leading to a large decrease in expected equity returns.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article was to {{describe}} and to apply a comprehensive set of guiding principles in the selection of measurement instruments for a longitudinal epidemiologic study focusing on functioning using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) as reference framework. Based on the literature, the ICF linkage rules, and the definition of ICF categories to be measured, the following guiding principles for selecting measurement instruments are defined: redundancy, efficiency, level of detail of <b>information,</b> <b>comparability,</b> feasibility, and truth and discrimination. Examples illustrate that the application of guiding principles allows for a systematic and reasoned process of measurement instrument selection and thus offers a potential solution for the multifaceted challenges that one encounters in the selection of measurement instruments. It is transparently demonstrated how the ICF linkage rules enable researchers to address issues such as efficiency, comparability, and redundancy and how the definition of a set of ICF categories to be measured allows assessing inefficiencies in measurement instruments. Because of the ICF linkage rules and the definition of ICF categories to be measured, new guiding principles for selecting measurement instruments emerge. The main challenges lie in the difficulty to quantify and prioritize the applicability of guiding principles {{and the fact that they}} strongly interact. Notably, the prioritization and application of guiding principles must be defined considering the specific characteristics and aims of the specific study...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is twofold. First, it intends to assess the level of {{comparability}} of the fair valuebased valuation criteria for biological assets of Portuguese dairy farms after the adoption of the Portuguese Accounting Standardization System. Second, it presents an innovative valuation model to assess the fair value of dairy herds. Design/methodology/approach – The paper conducts a multiple case study at dairy farms in the central region of Portugal which had adopted the new Accounting Standardization System. Data were captured through interviews to assess how dairy farms were using the new valuation criteria required by this recent accounting frame of reference. A proposal for a model to measure fair value is presented. Findings – Main findings indicate that market values for dairy production animals are inconsistent, reducing financial <b>information</b> <b>comparability</b> levels. To solve these problems, the authors propose a new model to assess fair value based on the net present value (NPV) of future cash-flows. This is a possible method to measure bovines that are in a breeding stage and it will assure the comparability of financial statements among dairy farms. Research limitations/implications – The study is confined to one case study and one country, not allowing generalization. originality/value – Results indicate the need to harmonize one possible method for measuring cattle that are in a breeding stage. In order to overcome these shortcomings, a model was designed to calculate the fair value of dairy production based on the NPV of future economic benefits...|$|E

However, 2 -D PAGE protein maps with satisfactory proteomic <b>information</b> and <b>comparability</b> to fresh tissues have never been described to date. In the present study, we report 2 -D PAGE separation and MS identification of full-length proteins extracted from FFPE skeletal muscle tissue. The 2 -D protein profiles obtained from FFPE tissues could be matched to those achieved from frozen tissues replicates. Up to 250 spots were clearly detected in 2 -D maps of proteins from FFPE tissue following standard mass-compatible silver staining. Protein spots from both FFPE and frozen tissue 2 -D gels were excised, subjected to in situ hydrolysis, and identified by MS analysis. Matched spots produced matched protein identifications. Moreover, 2 -D protein maps from FFPE tissues were successfully subjected to Western immunoblotting, producing comparable results to fresh-frozen tissues. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that, when adequately extracted, full-length proteins from FFPE tissues might be suitable to 2 -D PAGE-MS analysis, allowing differential proteomic studies on the vast existing archives of healthy and pathological-fixed tissues...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{content of}} and methods for {{collecting}} health information often vary across settings and challenge the comparability of health information across time, individuals or populations. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) contains an exhaustive set of categories of information which constitutes a unified and consistent language of human functioning suitable {{as a reference}} for comparing health information. Methods and results: In two earlier papers, we have proposed rules for linking existing health information to the ICF. Further refinements to these existing ICF Linking Rules are {{presented in this paper}} to enhance the transparency of the linking process. The refinements involve preparing information for linking, perspectives from which information is collected and the categorization of response options. Issues regarding the linking of information not covered or unspecified within the ICF are also revisited in this paper. Conclusion: The ICF Linking Rules are valuable for enhancing comparability of health information to ensure that information is available in a consistent manner to serve as a foundation for evidence-based decision-making across all levels of health systems. The refinements presented in this paper enhance transparency in, and ultimately reliability of the process of, linking health information to the ICF. Implications for Rehabilitation: The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) constitutes a unified and consistent language of human functioning suitable as a reference for comparing health <b>information.</b> <b>Comparability</b> of information is essential to ensure that the widest range of information is available in a consistent manner for any decision-maker {{at all levels of the}} health system.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Globalization (primarily the {{economic}} one) is today an incontestable reality {{that has an}} important influence on the human condition, socioeconomic and cultural situation of the collectivities. The SMEs have an important {{position in the world}} wide economy. The accounting information provided by them must have the same role.

Asking this question we must try to give an answer without ignoring the opinion of those who act in “in this show”. At European level, the legitimacy to develop standards specific to SME is contested. However, this global accounting standard may represents a very significant step on the path to global convergence of financial reporting practices by SMEs. It will contribute to enhancing the quality and comparability of SME financial statements around the world and assist SMEs in gaining access to finance. We consider that IFRS for SMEs may still be considered too complex for micro-entities; however many of the requirements will not be applicable for entities with a more simple business model. The extent to which IFRS for SMEs can be used for tax purposes remains an issue that requires further study...|$|R

Filling this knowledge gap {{is needed to}} uncover the needs of this target population and to provide <b>information</b> on <b>comparability</b> of health related phenomena such as burnout across countries. This study examined work related characteristics, work-home and home-work interference and burnout among Serbian primary healthcare physicians (PHPs) and compared burnout levels with other medical doctors in EU countries. Methods Data were collected via surveys which contained Maslach Burnout Inventory and other validated instruments measuring work and home related characteristics. The sample consisted of 373 PHPs working in 12 primary healthcare centres. Data were analysed using t- tests and Chi square tests. Results No gender differences were detected on mean scores of variables among Serbian physicians, who experience high levels of personal accomplishment, workload, job control and social support, medium {{to high levels of}} emotional exhaustion, medium levels of depersonalisation and work-home interference, and low levels of home-work interference. There were more women than men who experienced low job control and high depersonalisation. Serbian physicians experienced significantly higher emotional exhaustion and lower depersonalisation than physicians in some other European countries. Conclusions To diminish excessive workload, the number of physicians working in primary healthcare centres in Serbia should be increased. Considering that differences between countries were detected on all burnout subcomponents, work-related interventions for employees should be country specific. The role of gender needs to be closely examined in future studies as well. </p...|$|R

We hypothesize that firm-level heterogeneity in IFRS compliance explains the limited comparability effect. To test this conjecture, we first hand-collect data on IFRS compliance for a sample of German and Italian firms and find that firm-, region-, and country-level incentives systematically shape IFRS compliance. We then use the identified compliance determinants to explain the variance in the comparability effect of mandatory IFRS adoption and find it to vary systematically with firm-level compliance determinants, suggesting that only firms with high compliance incentives experience substantial increases in comparability. Moreover, we document that firms from countries with tighter reporting enforcement experience larger IFRS comparability effects, and that public firms adopting IFRS become less comparable to local GAAP private firms from the same country...|$|R

Although several PCR-based methods are currently in use, there is little <b>information</b> on their <b>comparability.</b> In this study, four quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assays (SYBR green and TaqMan chemistries) targeting the secY, lfb 1, and lipL 32 genes were evaluated as diagnostic assays. In our hands, these assays can detect between 102 and 103 bacteria/ml of pure culture, whole-blood, plasma, and serum samples. In three independent experiments, we found a slightly higher sensitivity of the PCR assays in plasma than in whole blood and serum. We also evaluated the specificity of the PCR assays on reference Leptospira strains, including newly described Leptospira species, and clinical isolates. No amplification was detected for DNA obtained from saprophytic or intermediate Leptospira species. However, among the pathogens, we identified sequence polymorphisms in target genes that result in primer and probe mismatches and affect qPCR assay performance. In conclusion, most of these assays are sensitive and specific tools for routine diagnosis of leptospirosis.

A variety of PCR-based methods are currently in use; however, there is little <b>information</b> on their <b>comparability.</b> This study assessed the relative performance of different quantitative assays. A multicenter comparative study was performed at eight sites using three panels consisting of serial dilutions of quantified EBV DNA and extracts from a total of 19 whole-blood specimens. Samples were distributed and tested blindly. Instrumentation, probe chemistries, amplification targets, and other test-related aspects varied considerably between laboratories. Each laboratory's calibration curve indicated strong evidence of a consistent log-linear relationship between viral load and cycle threshold, suggesting that intralaboratory tracking of a given patient would yield similar relative quantitative trends among the participating test sites. There was strong concordance among laboratories with respect to qualitative test results; however, marked quantitative discordance was seen. For most samples, the across-laboratory interquartile range of the reported viral load (in copies/μl) was roughly 0. 6 log-units, and for one sample the overall range was approximately 4. 2 log-units. While intralaboratory tracking of patients may yield similar results, these data indicate a need for caution when attempting to compare clinical results obtained at different institutions and suggest the potential value to be gained by more standardized testing methodology...|$|R

Peak twist measurements were achieved in 274 (20 %) participants. 66 participants were randomly selected for the reproducibility study. 20 additional participants had scans 4 – 6 weeks apart for temporal variability and 3 D echocardiography to assess the agreement between 2 DSTE and 3 DSTE. Reproducibility was evaluated using the intraclass coefficient of correlation (ICC). Better reproducibility for rotation and twist were obtained when measured at the endocardium, and when using more recent software versions, Peak twist and rotation were significantly different using two versions of the same software. Agreement with 3 DSTE was better using newer software. Conclusion: Feasibility of 2 DSTE is low in this cohort of elderly individuals severely limiting its utility in clinical settings...|$|R
40|$|The {{important}} task {{of carrying out}} the internal audit of expenses {{is to get the}} sufficient and reliable audit evidence. This can be achieved by using the analytical procedures in the audit process. The identification of the analytical procedures with the financial analysis of the business activities prevents from the efficient usage of them in the internal audit of the restaurant business expenses. The knowledge of internal auditors about the instructional techniques of analytical procedures and their tasks, depending on the verification steps are insufficient. The purpose of the article is the developing the methods of the internal audit of the restaurant business expenses based on an integrated application of analytical procedures. The nature and purpose of analytical procedures have been investigated in the article. It have been identified the factors influencing on auditor’s decision about the choice of analytical procedures complex. It was recommended to identify among them the purpose of analytical procedures, the type and structure of the enterprise, the source of the available information, the existence of financial and non-financial <b>information,</b> reliability and <b>comparability</b> of the available information. It have been identified the tasks of analytical procedures, depending on the verification steps. It was offered the analytical procedures complex as a part of internal audit of the restaurant business expenses. This complex contains a list of the analytical procedures, instructional techniques of analysis that are used in the appropriate procedure and the brief overview of the content of procedure...|$|R
40|$|The {{health care}} is an {{essential}} need of the society {{and it is an}} integral part thereof. In this sense, everybody is entitled to medical services to provide health and well-being that improves lifestyle. Policymakers and researchers focus substantial attention on hospitals and public spending of fmancial resources, because they recognise the political power and the general collective obligation of preserving a health care for the present and future generations. The empirical analysis used a sample based in the 31 corporate hospitals that belong to the Portuguese health care system as a National Health Service in the period 2002 - 2003. The disclosure of <b>information</b> allows <b>comparability</b> and identifies similarities between the hospitals in the sample. Relevant organizational variables were managed statistically through the multivariate analysis. The geographical analysis shows inequalities of the distribution of hospitals facilities in Portugal, with marked concentration in the urban coastal areas, affected by the number of persons that live there. The financial analysis is supported in the Portuguese Official Accounting Plan that follows the same accounting trend of corporations. So, the disclosure and the accountability system are not opened up to a new field for accounting in health care based in the Health Official Accounting Plan. The research shows implications at the operational level, the efficiency and the effectiveness of the health care strategy with differences between hospitals. The authors believe that, as complex organizations, hospitals must based their disclosure police in transparency to allow patients to identifY their own orientations that should be driven mainly by corporate social responsibility as a public service and not by the economic perspective of a business. This research confirms that as a global strategy for the health care system, corporate social responsibility is urgently needed. As a finite resource, the health should demand a permanent attention from society, as well as the Government in accomplishment prevention and monitoring systems, with a view to the defence of a sustainable health care system. More than merely investing efforts in fighting for political changes, without any advantage for society it is crucial to invest in prevention of the quality of life as a Basic requirement to honour the corporate social responsibility in hospitals. Especially needed are health care improvements and infrastructures. In summary, the health care system exists as a fundamental element that assures life and high standards of living, so it should be available to everybody and for everybody [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: An {{increasing}} {{number of studies have}} estimated monetary diet cost using various dietary assessment methods, based on databases on retail food prices, for investigating its association with dietary intake and health outcomes. However, <b>information</b> regarding the <b>comparability</b> of monetary diet cost across dietary assessment methods is absolutely lacking. This study compared monetary cost of dietary energy estimated from weighed dietary records (DRs) with that estimated from a self-administered diet history questionnaire (DHQ). The subjects were 92 Japanese women aged 31 – 69 years and 92 Japanese men aged 32 – 76 years. The DHQ (assessing diet during the preceding month) and 4 -day DRs (one weekend day and three weekdays) were completed in each season over a 1 -year period (DHQs 1 - 4 and DRs 1 - 4, respectively). An additional DHQ was completed at one year after completing DHQ 1 (DHQ 5). Monetary cost of dietary energy (Japanese yen/ 4184 kJ) was calculated using food intake information derived from each dietary assessment method, based on retail food prices. Pearson correlation between the mean of DRs 1 - 4 and mean of DHQs 1 - 4 was 0. 64 for women and 0. 69 for men. Pearson correlation between the mean of DRs 1 - 4 and DHQ 1 was 0. 60 for women and 0. 52 for men, while intraclass correlation between DHQ 1 and DHQ 5 was 0. 64 for women and 0. 51 for men. These data indicate reasonable comparability of monetary cost of dietar...|$|R
