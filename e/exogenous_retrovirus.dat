MOV 10 is a superfamily 1 putative RNA helicase {{that controls the}} replication of several RNA viruses and whose homologs are necessary for the repression of endogenous mobile elements. Here, we employ both ectopic expression and gene knockdown approaches to analyse the role of human MOV 10 in the replication of a panel of <b>exogenous</b> <b>retroviruses</b> and endogenous retroelements. Results MOV 10 overexpression substantially decreased the production of infectious retrovirus particles, as well the propagation of LTR and non-LTR endogenous retroelements. Most significantly, RNAi-mediated silencing of endogenous MOV 10 enhanced the replication of both LTR and non-LTR endogenous retroelements, but not the production of infectious retrovirus particles demonstrating that natural levels of MOV 10 suppress retrotransposition, but have no impact on infection by <b>exogenous</b> <b>retroviruses.</b> Furthermore, functional studies showed that MOV 10 is not necessary for miRNA or siRNA-mediated mRNA silencing. Conclusions We have identified novel specificity for human MOV 10 in the control of retroelement replication and hypothesise that MOV 10 may be a component of a cellular pathway or process that selectively regulates the replication of endogenous retroelements in somatic cells. </p...|$|R

Three different amino acid motifs, namely PT/SAP, PPXY and YPXnL {{have been shown}} {{to play a major role}} in the release of <b>exogenous</b> <b>retroviruses.</b> Although the L-domains of <b>exogenous</b> <b>retroviruses</b> have been studied comprehensively, little is known about these motifs in endogenous human retroviruses. Results: Using a molecular clone of the human endogenous retrovirus K 113 that had been engineered to reverse the presumed non-synonymous postinsertional mutations in the major genes, we identified three functional L-domains of the virus, all located in the Gag p 15 protein. A consensus PTAP tetrapeptide serves as the core of a main L-domain for the virus and its inactivation reduces virus release in HEK 293 T cells by over 80 %. Electron microscopy of cells expressing the PTAP mutant revealed predominantly late budding structures and budding chains at the plasma membrane. The fact that this motif determines subcellular colocalization with Tsg 101, an ESCRT-I complex protein known to bind to the core tetrapeptide, supports its role as an L-domain. Moreover, two YPXnL motifs providing additional L-domain function were identified in the p 15 protein. One is adjacent to the PTAP sequence and the other is in the p 15 N-terminus. Mutations in either motif diminishes virus release and induces an L-domain phenotype while inactivation of all three L-domains results in a complete loss of particl...|$|R

In the absence of any fitness benefit provided by the long terminal repeat (LTR), we conclude that signatures of ERVs are likely to go to fixation within a population when the probability of evolving cellular/humoral immunity to a related exogenous version of the virus is extremely small. We extend this model to examine whether changing the speed of the host life history influences the likelihood that an <b>exogenous</b> <b>retrovirus</b> will incorporate and spread to fixation.

Deletion of the YY 1 -binding site from the retroviral genome leads to a major loss of silencing in embryonic cells and a coordinated loss of repressive histone marks from the proviral chromatin. Depletion of YY 1 protein results in marked upregulation of expression of exogenous viruses and of selected ERVs. Finally, we report an embryonic cell-specific interaction between YY 1 and Trim 28. Our results suggest a major role for YY 1 in the silencing of both <b>exogenous</b> <b>retroviruses</b> and ERVs in embryonic cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{human genome}} {{contains}} {{a large number}} of sequences that belong to the HERV-K family of human endogenous retroviruses. Most of these elements are likely remnants of ancient infections by ancestral <b>exogenous</b> <b>retroviruses.</b> To obtain further insight into the evolutionary history and molecular mechanisms responsible for the diversity of the human HERV-K elements, we analyzed several aspects of their genome structure. The nucleotide composition of the HERV-K genome was found to be highly biased and asymmetric, with an abundance of the A nucleotide in the viral (+) strand. A similar trend has been reported for the genomes of several <b>exogenous</b> <b>retroviruses,</b> with different nucleotides as the preferred building block. Other genome characteristics that were reported previously for actively replicating retroviruses are also apparent for the endogenous HERV-K virus. In particular, we observed suppression of the dinucleotide CpG, which represents potential methylation sites, and a strong preference for synonymous substitutions within the open reading frame of the reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme. Furthermore, the mutational spectrum of the HERV-K RT enzyme was evaluated by nucleotide sequence comparison of 34 available elements. Interestingly, this analysis revealed a striking similarity with the mutational pattern of the HIV- 1 RT enzyme, with a preference for G-to-A and C-to-T transitions. It is proposed that the mutational bias of the HERV-K RT enzyme {{played a role in the}} shaping of this retroviral genome, which was actively replicating more than 30 million years ago. This effect can still be observed in the contemporary endogenous HERV-K element...|$|R
40|$|Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) {{abound in}} avian and {{mammalian}} genomes, including humans, {{as a result}} of germline infections by <b>exogenous</b> <b>retroviruses.</b> Most ERVs are defective for production of infectious virus. The defectiveness of ERVs is generally inversely correlated with the length of their residence in the host germline. These ERVs affect retrovirus-induced disease in a number of ways, including manipulation of the immune response, inhibition or facilitation of entry or other steps of virus replication, or as participants in the generation of infectious pathogenic viruses. Ancient ERVs likely have neutral or beneficial roles for the hosts that carry them. However, multiple examples show that additional pathogenic retroviruses will continue to emerge using ERVs as a source of genetic diversity...|$|R
