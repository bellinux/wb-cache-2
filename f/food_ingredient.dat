5|$|Sugar was {{a luxury}} in Europe until the 18th century, {{when it became}} more widely available. It then became popular and by the 19th century, sugar came to be {{considered}} a necessity. This evolution of taste and demand for sugar as an essential <b>food</b> <b>ingredient</b> unleashed major economic and social changes. It drove, in part, colonization of tropical islands and nations where labor-intensive sugarcane plantations and sugar manufacturing could thrive. The demand for cheap labor to perform the hard work involved in its cultivation and processing increased the demand for the slave trade from Africa (in particular West Africa). After slavery was abolished, there was high demand for indentured laborers from South Asia (in particular India). Millions of slave and indentured laborers were brought into the Caribbean and the Americas, Indian Ocean colonies, southeast Asia, Pacific Islands, and East Africa and Natal. The modern ethnic mix of many nations that have been settled in the last two centuries has been influenced by the demand for sugar.|$|E

In 2001, the Mayor of Seoul announced there would be no extra enforcement efforts to control the sale of dog meat during the 2002 FIFA World Cup, which was partially hosted in Seoul. In March 2008, the Seoul Metropolitan Government announced its plan to put forward a policy suggestion to the central government to legally classify slaughter dogs as livestock, reigniting debate on the issue.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the effects of several <b>food</b> <b>ingredients</b> on the relative radiation sensitivity (RRS) of Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes inoculated onto ground pork. Garlic, leek, onion, and ginger were prepared in 3 different forms; pressurized, freeze-dried, and 70 % ethanol extracted. The prepared <b>food</b> <b>ingredients</b> were subdivided into 2 groups, non-irradiated and irradiated with 5 kGy of gamma irradiation, before addition to ground pork. The prepared <b>food</b> <b>ingredients</b> were added at concentrations of 1 % and 5 % (w/w) into radiation-sterilized ground pork and inoculated with E. coli and L. monocytogenes (106 CFU/mL). For E. coli inoculated pork, the most efficient ingredient was ethanol extracted leek (RRS= 3. 89), followed by freeze-dried ginger and leek (RRS= 3. 66 and 3. 63, respectively) when used without pasteurization. However, when the <b>food</b> <b>ingredients</b> were irradiation-pasteurized, the freeze-dried ginger showed the highest RRS (4. 10). When 5 % natural materials were added, RRS was the highest for freeze-dried and ethanol extracted onion (4. 44 and 4. 65, respectively). For L. monocytogenes, the RRS was relatively lower than E. coli in general. The most efficient material was pressurized and freeze-dried onion (RRS= 2. 13 and 2. 08, respectively) at a concentration of 1 %. No increase in RRS was observed at increased concentration of <b>food</b> <b>ingredients.</b> These results suggest that the addition of particular <b>food</b> <b>ingredients</b> increased the efficiency of radiation-sterilization. However, changes in RRS were dependent on the species of microorganism as well as the form of the <b>food</b> <b>ingredients...</b>|$|R
