5|$|Kane's former youth coach Alex Inglethorpe {{has said}} of him:When {{he first came}} into the under-18s as a 15 year old, he stood out in the sense he looked a bit gangly. He moved {{slightly}} awkwardly, {{he was a bit}} cumbersome. But look closer, {{he had a lot of}} ability, a great technique. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> surprised people how good he was. Tactically he was very flexible. He often played in midfield. I remember seeing him once playing as a holding midfielder.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is {{the most}} gifted and {{dedicated}} cricketer one could ever wish to play with, never satisfied with his performance and always seeking {{for a little more}} perfection.|$|E
25|$|John Bonham {{played the}} drums {{like someone who}} didn't {{know what was going}} to happen next—like he was teetering on the edge of a cliff. No one has come close to that since, and I don't think anybody ever will. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> will forever be the {{greatest}} drummer of all time.|$|E
60|$|FREDA. [Faintly] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> in the billiard-room with my lady.|$|R
60|$|SYLVIA. Of course I like him.... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> a {{very good}} sort.|$|R
60|$|KNOX. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> a fraud. <b>I</b> {{never saw}} anyone look so robust.|$|R
25|$|This {{country has}} been good to me. It gave me {{everything}} I have. I have never come out for any candidate before but I think Wendell L. Willkie {{will give us a}} square deal. So I am for Willkie because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> will help my people, and I figure my people should be for him, too.|$|E
25|$|I met Laughton only once, at a party. Of all {{the actors}} I have seen, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{would have come}} closest to doing Nero Wolfe perfectly. A motion picture {{producer}} (I forget who) {{asked him to do}} a series of Nero Wolfe movies, and he had said he would agree to do one but would not commit himself to a series.|$|E
25|$|My {{father was}} heartbroken, and I saw him {{physically}} and mentally broken by the ordeal. He fought back {{with the help of}} my mother and recovered his strength, confidence, and pride before he {{died of a heart attack}} five years later. In the end, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> found comfort in knowing that what he did saved some airmen's lives, and that was worth more to him than four stars.|$|E
60|$|TWEENY. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> {{working out}} that plan for laying on hot and cold.|$|R
60|$|MILLY. He's been a-moänin' and a-groänin' in 'is sleep, but <b>I</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> be wakkenin' oop.|$|R
60|$|Charlie Ward. This gentleman {{wants to}} speak to you. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> looking out for a wife.|$|R
25|$|For {{political}} reasons, Pakistan claims {{victory in}} the 1965 war. In my opinion, the war ended {{in a kind of}} stalemate. We were in a position of strength. Had the war continued for a few more days, we would have gained a decisive victory. I advised then prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri not to agree for ceasefire. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was under pressure from the United Nations and some countries.|$|E
25|$|There were {{selective}} {{portions of}} al-Fadl's testimony that I believe was false, {{to help support}} the picture that he helped the Americans join together. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> lied {{in a number of}} specific testimony about a unified image of what this organization was. It made al-Qaeda the new Mafia or the new Communists. It made them identifiable as a group and therefore made it easier to prosecute any person associated with al-Qaeda for any acts or statements made by bin Laden.|$|E
25|$|I {{used to have}} {{to punch}} a time clock at Columbia. Every day of my life. That's what it was like. I was under {{exclusive}} contract, like they owned me… <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> had my dressing room bugged… He was very possessive of me as a person, he didn't want me to go out with anybody, have any friends. No one can live that way. So I fought him… You want to know what I think of Harry Cohn? He was a monster.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps he didn't {{understand}} your joking, father. He's a foreigner, and shy and proud, and--not like the others. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{knew what you}} meant then, {{any more than he}} believed he was making a bargain before. He may be poor, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> been--a--a--gentleman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There's rather lovely {{simplicity}} about Gerald, I think,' said Ursula, 'so defiant, somehow! Oh, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> VERY lovable.' ...|$|R
60|$|DAISY. You {{know his}} name. Why don't {{you call him}} by it? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> going almost at once.|$|R
25|$|So, {{while the}} name Packer appears {{many times in}} the book, the only serious comment that the writer makes about the whole affair (and he is right in his comment) is ”In one respect, and in only one <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>he</b> (Packer) has done a service to the game by forcing us all to face the fact cricketers have been abysmally ill-paid.” So, as a whole “The Best Loved Game” is not about any {{controversial}} issue, it is simply about cricket being part of the English summer.|$|E
25|$|There {{seemed very}} {{little hope of}} native Christians {{receiving}} anything through the instrumentality of their officials, nor did the foreign powers think they were called upon to provide indemnity for these. All {{the survivors of the}} churches were reduced to absolute poverty. They were harmless, inoffensive people who had no feuds with their neighbors and had not intruded their religion on any one. This at least was true of the Protestant Christians. If a missionary, by means of his personal influence and by the assistance of the local official who might be friendly to him, could bring the neighbors of his persecuted people to see the error of their ways, and persuade them to contribute money for the rebuilding of destroyed houses and for the support of the survivors of the families, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was justified in so doing.|$|E
25|$|Jandamarra The Play (2008) {{was sold}} out before its opening season premiere at the Perth International Arts Festival. As the {{director}} of Bunuba Films since 2000, Oscar {{was one of the}} driving forces in the company's marathon journey to bring Jandamarra's story to the stage. Jandamarra, a Bunuba warrior born in 1873, was famous for leading his people in an armed uprising against the British colonisation of their lands. He outsmarted the police and settlers in the Kimberley for years, before being killed in 1897 at the age of 24. Geoffrey Bolton, a distinguished Australian historian, compared Jandamarra to guerilla leaders like the Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata and Sicilian rebel Salvatore Giuliano. Oscar said Jandamarra was fighting for his people’s freedom. “He was not an outlaw, he was fighting for his land, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was a freedom fighter”.|$|E
60|$|CATHERINE. I {{would not}} deprive you {{of him for}} worlds; though really <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> rather a darling [she pats his cheek].|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Miss Pinnegar decidedly, as Alvina re-entered. [...] "You can {{say what}} you like--but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> very pleasant, very pleasant." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Really, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> right, you know. After all, {{what is the}} Army for? They {{ought to}} have known. It's only {{encouraging}} them." ...|$|R
25|$|Mr. Ament left us {{this morning}} after a delay here of five days. The Mark Twain article in the North American Review cut him like a knife and weighs deeply on him, but he takes it in a most {{beautiful}} spirit. The sympathy of all the Peking missionaries, and their absolute confidence in his integrity and the uprightness of his course {{has been a great}} help to him, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> goes back well prepared to set things right so far as he can in person. He plans to write a series of articles telling exactly what he has done. It will be a story worth telling, even if there were no occasion for it as a vindication of his character. I have been with him all this first week since he heard about the Sun and the Review articles. The calm and sweet spirit in which he has taken it and his brave resolution to set the matter right so far as in him lies, is answer enough for those who know of it.|$|E
25|$|Jim Wyatt, of the Tennesseean, {{reports that}} Ringer is the {{favorite}} for the 3rd string job, and almost a lock to make the roster. Fullback Ahmard Hall said “He’s a character guy, and you could tell that from the start, He’s the total package. You rarely get that combination of humility and natural athletic ability and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> has that great combination. You combine those two and you get someone who could be unstoppable.’’ Of all the praise, Ringer responded, “I have to give credit to how I was brought up. I {{grew up in a}} religious family and I know without God none of this would be possible for me anyway, so that definitely keeps me humble. My personality is not to boast and brag about the accomplishments and things I am trying to do. Actions speak louder than words and that is what I try and strive for.’’ In a 17-23 loss to the Cleveland Browns, Ringer only had one run for two yards. Ringer finished off the pre-season with a 7 carry 18 yard performance, in a 27-13 win over the Green Bay Packers.|$|E
25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E
6000|$|I'm not prejudiced against him, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> {{all right}} for looks,' said Emmie, 'but there's {{too much of the}} little mannie about him.' ...|$|R

5000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> {{been very}} good, very strong up front for us. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> been a {{dominant}} player at times." [...] Jaguars head coach Jack Del Rioon McDaniel in August 2008 ...|$|R
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Spike Lee. Asked why he chose Lee to direct the video, Jackson responded, [...] "'They Don't Care About Us' has an edge, and Spike Lee had approached me. It's a public awareness song and that's what he is all about. It's a protest kind of song... and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was perfect for it".|$|E
500|$|Upon joining Holby City, Roberts {{was asked}} who {{he felt his}} character's ideal woman would be. He replied: [...] "Joseph {{is a man who}} {{suppresses}} and represses his emotions– especially regarding women. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> harbours very strong feelings of admiration for Connie but is frankly surprised and secretly thrilled when any woman shows him affection. Although so far this is rare!" ...|$|E
500|$|After Tony Blair's {{election}} as Labour Party leader in 1994, Thatcher praised Blair as [...] "probably {{the most formidable}} Labour leader since Hugh Gaitskell", adding: [...] "I {{see a lot of}} socialism behind their front bench, but not in Mr Blair. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> genuinely has moved." [...] Blair reciprocated in describing Thatcher as a [...] "thoroughly determined person, and that is an admirable quality".|$|E
6000|$|... "Haddon {{certainly}} didn't make a {{very good}} impression on me," [...] declared Jack. [...] "I'm frank to admit <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> a thoroughly bad egg." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought him}} {{a very nice}} civil-spoken young fellow," [...] said Mrs. Athelny, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> just the sort to make any girl happy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It can't {{be helped}} if things turn that way; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> too much {{frightened by the}} {{disappearance}} of Gus to leave a good hiding-place." ...|$|R
