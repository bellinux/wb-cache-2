40|$|We {{consider}} an inventory system {{where there is}} random demand from customers as well as unreliable supplying capacity from supplier. In many real-world cases, supplier might fail to satisfy the amount of order from retailers or producers so that only partial proportion of order is satisfied or even fail to deliver all of the order. Moreover, recently a concern regarding unreliable supplying capacity has been increasing since the globalization makes the retailer or producer face the extended supply network with complicated and risky supplying capacity. Also, we consider two classified customers, of which one {{is willing to pay}} extra charge for <b>expedited</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>service</b> but the other is not reluctant to delay the delivery without any extra charge. We show that there exists an optimal threshold for inventory and price for each service level in the following sense: if the inventory level is less than the predetermined threshold, then the retailer or producer needs to order up to the threshold level and offer threshold price corresponding to service level. Otherwise, the retailer does not need to order. The risk of stockout due to unreliable supplying capacity can be mitigated by the dynamic pricing and inventory control with multiple service levels...|$|E

40|$|The post {{apartheid}} {{government has}} been engaged {{in the process of}} delivering formal housing, water, and sanitation services to the poor. Because of huge backlogs in the provision of these basic services, the government has focused on meeting quantitative targets. The government has made significant strides to reduce the level of backlogs in basic <b>service</b> the <b>delivery.</b> However, there were challenges that confronted government in its endeavours to <b>expedite</b> <b>delivery</b> of <b>services.</b> The main challenge relates to the fragmentation in the funding mechanism for housing and the physical infrastructure, particularly water and sanitation infrastructure. Concerns have been raised about the ability of the local sphere of government to provide suitable land and quality physical infrastructure which were a prerequisite for sustainable settlements. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the implementation of water and sanitation policies in a low-cost housing (LCH) settlement of Ambleton and Ambleton Extension in Pietermaritzburg.

40|$|Transport of {{clinical}} specimens and etiologic agents {{should be done}} with care to minimize the hazard to humans or the environment and also to protect the viability of suspected pathogens. Transport of infectious items by public or commercial delivery systems may be subject to local or national regulations. If possible, send specimens so that they will arrive during working hours to ensure proper handling and prompt plating of the specimens. Inform the receiving laboratory as soon as possible that the specimens are coming, preferably before sending the specimens. Depending on local conditions, within-country transport may be by ground or by air. If specimens are sent by a messenger, the messenger must know the location of the laboratory and the appropriate person to contact. The sender should identify the fastest and most reliable way of transport in advance, whether it be by bicycle, motorcycle, car, ambulance or public transport, and should make sure that adequate funds are available to reimburse costs for fuel or public transport. For longer distances, the fastest transport service may be air freight or <b>expedited</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>service.</b> Since the ice packs or dry ice will last only 24 to 48 hours, arrangements should be made for immediate collection at the receiving airport. When the specimens are shipped by air, the following information should be communicated immediately to the receiving laboratory: the air bill number, the flight number, and the times and dates of departure and arrival of the flight...|$|E
40|$|The {{relations}} between central {{and local governments}} {{as well as with}} their partners in the <b>delivery</b> of <b>services</b> {{is the subject of this}} study. This subject is important in understanding the way institutions contribute to development, particularly given the argument that decentralisation accelerates poverty reduction through the <b>delivery</b> of basic <b>services.</b> For many developing countries, the challenge faced in decentralisation is how to balance central-local relations in a way that improves the provision of basic services. A second challenge is how to strengthen partnerships with non state actors to <b>expedite</b> the <b>delivery</b> of <b>services.</b> Decentralisation can sometimes lead to pluralism or to distributed institutional monopoly. Pluralism refers to a situation where decentralisation ensures that roles are shared by two or more organisations or institutions. Distributed monopoly refers to a situation where roles are distributed spatially (from the centre to the local government level), but concentrated in one organisation or institution. In this study we explore the reality of balancing central-local relations in the provision of basic services in Ghana; the type of decentralisation that has emerged since the introduction of economic and institutional reforms in the late 1980 s; and, whether it is characterised by distributed monopoly or pluralism. We further examine whether plural central-local relations, where they exist, perform better than monopoly arrangements in the <b>delivery</b> of basic <b>services,</b> with and emphasis on water and sanitation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{outsourcing}} of {{income tax return}} preparation by Australian accounting firms. It identifies {{the extent to which}} firms are currently outsourcing accounting services or considering outsourcing accounting services, with a focus on personal and business income tax return preparation. The motivations and barriers for outsourcing by Australian accounting firms are also considered in this paper. Privacy, security of client data, and the competence of the outsourcing provider’s staff have been identified as risks associated with outsourcing. An expectation relating to confidentiality of client data is also examined in this paper. Statistical analysis of data collected from a random sample of Australian accounting firms using a survey questionnaire provided the empirical data for the paper. The results indicate that the majority of Australian accounting firms are either currently outsourcing or considering outsourcing accounting services, and firms are outsourcing taxation preparation both onshore and offshore. The results also indicate that firms expect the volume of outsourced work to increase in the future. In contrast to the literature identifying labour arbitrage as the primary driver for organisations choosing to outsource, this study found that the main factors considered by accounting firms in the decision to outsource were to <b>expedite</b> <b>delivery</b> of <b>services</b> to clients and to enable the firm to focus on core competencies. Data from this study also supports the literature which indicates that not all tax practitioners are adhering to codes of conduct in relation to client confidentiality. Research identifying the extent to which accounting services are outsourced is limited, therefore significant contributions to the academic literature and the accounting profession are provided by this study...|$|R
40|$|MM- P&DMThere {{are large}} water {{services}} backlogs {{in rural areas}} in South Africa. The local sphere of government has the responsibility to provide basic water services to all people. In addition national government has introduced strategies to substantially fast-track water <b>services</b> <b>delivery</b> to the poor. To expedite the reduction of water services backlogs, {{there is a need}} for alternative municipal <b>services</b> <b>delivery</b> models. Despite government policies for civil society participation in developmental strategies, municipalities are reticent to enter into <b>services</b> <b>delivery</b> partnerships with civil society organisations. Sufficient theoretical and practical evidence exists to support the notion of municipal community partnerships. The study demonstrates the potential role of civil society organizations in water services partnerships with municipalities to eliminate services backlogs, thus improving social capital between municipalities and communities. This is a qualitative research study of the Tshiungani II village community management of the local water scheme in partnership with the Mutale Local Municipality. It demonstrates effective services management by the village water committee over time, and the resultant good will that emanates from such a municipal-community partnership. This model lends itself to replication in similar rural settings throughout the country, and could contribute substantially towards <b>expediting</b> water <b>services</b> <b>delivery</b> to rural communities...|$|R
