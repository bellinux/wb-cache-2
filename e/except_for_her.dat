60|$|Honora gladly promised, and <b>excepting</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> {{wonder at}} such a step {{on the part of}} the cousin whose plaything and pet she had {{hitherto}} been, she had no temptation to change her manner. She loved him as much as ever, but only as a kind elder brother, and she was glad that he was wise enough to see his immeasurable inferiority to the young missionary. It was a wonderful thing, and she was sorry for his disappointment; but after all, he took it so quietly that she did not think it could have hurt him much. It was only that he wanted to keep his pet in the country. He was not capable of love like Owen Sandbrook's.|$|R
60|$|He {{wondered}} whether {{she felt her}} meeting him was something of an adventure, but he was persuaded she was playing a part. Her frankness was not bold, the little, French-Canadian gestures were obviously borrowed, {{and some of the}} colloquialisms she used were out of date. <b>Except</b> <b>for</b> these, <b>her</b> talk was cultivated. For a time Lister tried to play up, and then resolved {{to see if he could}} break her reserve.|$|R
5|$|Queen Mary, {{along with}} the other Jutland wrecks, has been {{declared}} a protected place under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 to discourage further damage to the resting place of 1,266 officers and men. Surveys of this site conducted by nautical archaeologist Innes McCartney in 2001–03 have shown the wreck is in three sections, with the two forward sections being heavily damaged and in pieces. Her aft end is upside down and relatively complete <b>except</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> propellers, which have been salvaged. Examination of the damage to the ship has suggested that the initial explosion was not in the magazine of 'A' or 'B' forward main turrets, but instead in the magazine of the forward 4-inch battery. An explosion of the quantity of cordite in the main magazine would have been sufficient to also ignite 'Q' magazine, destroying much more of the ship. The explosion in the smaller magazine would have been sufficient to break the ship in two, the blast then spreading to the forward magazine and ripping apart the forward section.|$|E

25|$|Queen Mary {{design was}} criticised {{for being too}} traditional, {{especially}} when Normandie hull was revolutionary with a clipper-shaped, streamlined bow. <b>Except</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> cruiser stern, {{she seemed to be}} an enlarged version of her Cunard predecessors from the pre–First World War era. Her interior design, while mostly Art Deco, seemed restrained and conservative when compared to the ultramodern French liner. Queen Mary proved to be the more popular vessel than her larger rival, in terms of passengers carried.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the end of}} the Second World War, Queen Elizabeth was {{refitted}} and furnished as {{an ocean}} liner while her sister ship Queen Mary remained in her wartime role and grey appearance <b>except</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> funnels, which were repainted in the company's colours.

Sarada Devi is regarded as Ramakrishna's first disciple. <b>Except</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> hours of meditation, {{most of her time}} was spent in cooking for Ramakrishna and the growing number of his devotees.

Haderslev County was established in 1920 following the reunification of Denmark and South Jutland following the Schleswig Plebiscites. It was dissolved in 1970 when it merged with three other counties to form South Jutland County. Haderslev County corresponded geographically to the former Prussian Kreis Hadersleben <b>except</b> <b>for</b> Hvidding <b>Herred</b> which was transferred to Tønder County.

Claire makes the statement, after telling Tobias that he {{would be better off if}} he killed Agnes, Julia, and herself, that she will never know whether she wants to live until Agnes is dead. With this statement, Albee makes it sound as if Claire holds Agnes up as a role model, a model that she has never been able to reach. And instead of trying to reach it, she has done everything to live her life in a diametrically opposed manner.|$|R
25|$|In August 1989, Ethel meets a {{new love}} {{interest}} named Reggie Thompson (John Rutland). He invites {{her to go}} on a coach trip to Clacton for a dancing competition. Ethel is so excited that she shows Reggie a saucy nightie she has bought for the trip. When Dot, Marge Green (Pat Coombs) and Mo Butcher (Edna Doré) find out about the trip, they decide to go as well. Reggie arranges dancing partners for them and the ladies practise hard at the community centre for months before the trip. But upon arriving on holiday, Ethel grows disappointed in Reggie when he starts to show interest in another woman named Gladys. On the night of the dancing competition, Ethel finds that Reggie has run off with Gladys and she has no partner in the grand ballroom <b>except</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> 'little Willy'.
