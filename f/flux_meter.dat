50|$|ISO 9869 {{describes}} {{how to measure}} the thermal transmittance of a roof or a wall by using heat flux sensor. These heat flux meters usually consist of thermopiles which provide an electrical signal which is {{in direct proportion to}} the heat flux. Typically they might be about 100 mm in diameter and perhaps about 5 mm thick {{and they need to be}} fixed firmly to the roof or wall which is under test in order to ensure good thermal contact. When the heat flux is monitored over a sufficiently long time, the thermal transmittance can be calculated by dividing the average heat flux by the average difference in temperature between the inside and outside of the building.

40|$|The plate {{thermometer}} is {{a robust}} and simple instrument to use which can handle fierce environmental conditions. By measuring the temperature between the plate thermometer’s thin metal sheet and its insulation the adiabatic surface temperature and the incident radiation can be calculated. The virtual experiment, i. e. finite element temperature calculations, conducted during this {{investigation of the}} plate thermometer suggest using the thermal conduction coefficient equal to 8. 43 W/m 2 K and the lumped-heat coefficient equal to 4202 J/m 2 K together with the one-dimensional equations with one degree of freedom introduced in this report. The thermal conduction coefficient is due to conduction in the metal plate and the insulation. The lumped-heat coefficient is due to energy needed to heat the materials. These coefficients are originally depending on the thermal properties of the metal sheet and the insulation combined with two- dimensional effects (in the virtual experiment) in these materials, especially in the metal sheet. The experiment in the Room Corner Test configuration (ISO 834) shows that the plate thermometer has an advantage to the heat <b>flux</b> <b>meter</b> when convection occurs on to the instruments and the incident radiation shall be estimated. Analyses also indicate that the greatest advantage of the plate thermometer over the heat <b>flux</b> <b>meter</b> is achieved when Tr and Tg are close to each other. Estimating the convective heat transfer coefficient is the weak point using both the plate thermometer and the heat <b>flux</b> <b>meter.</b> However, the coefficient for the plate thermometer can for both free and forced convection be estimated using the equations for simple geometries given in for example Holman (1992), while {{this is not the}} case for the heat <b>flux</b> <b>meter.</b> Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

Although these observations are primarily based on limited experiments, when one considers the significance of these errors, the applicability of thermal imagery for quantifying the actual heat transfer condition of building assemblies becomes more attractive.|$|R

The method presumes that thermal properties of external walls, like conductivity, could still be obtained by a linear regression over values of independent measurements. And therefore could be used during fluctuating indoor and outdoor thermal conditions. The method {{is divided into two}} parts. First, the convection heat transfer coefficient is measured by heat <b>flux</b> <b>meters</b> (HFM) and thermography. And then, the overall heat transfer coefficient of a complete building element is measured by thermography to include all non-uniformities. In this study the thermal performance of a 140 mm thick laminated timber wall was measured. The wall was subjected to the outdoor weather conditions in Östersund, Sweden during January and February. The measurement values were found to have a large disparity as expected due to the rapid change in weather conditions. But still a linear regression with low confidence interval was obtained. The thermography results from a small uniform wall segment were validated with HFM measurements and 4 % difference was found, which suggest that the two methods could be equally effective. Yet, thermography has the advantage of measuring surface temperature over large area of building element. The overall heat transfer coefficient of a large wall area was found to be 11 % higher in comparison to the HFM measurements. This indicates that thermography could provide a more representative result as it captures areas of imperfections, point and linear thermal bridges...|$|R

40|$|This study {{describes}} a quantitative method using thermography {{to measure the}} thermal performance of complete building envelope elements that are subjected to non-steady state heat flow. The method presumes that thermal properties of external walls, like conductivity, could still be obtained by a linear regression over values of independent measurements. And therefore could be used during fluctuating indoor and outdoor thermal conditions. The method {{is divided into two}} parts. First, the convection heat transfer coefficient is measured by heat <b>flux</b> <b>meters</b> (HFM) and thermography. And then, the overall heat transfer coefficient of a complete building element is measured by thermography to include all non-uniformities. In this study the thermal performance of a 140  mm thick laminated timber wall was measured. The wall was subjected to the outdoor weather conditions in Östersund, Sweden during January and February. The measurement values were found to have a large disparity as expected due to the rapid change in weather conditions. But still a linear regression with low confidence interval was obtained. The thermography results from a small uniform wall segment were validated with HFM measurements and 4 % difference was found, which suggest that the two methods could be equally effective. Yet, thermography has the advantage of measuring surface temperature over large area of building element. The overall heat transfer coefficient of a large wall area was found to be 11 % higher in comparison to the HFM measurements. This indicates that thermography could provide a more representative result as it captures areas of imperfections, point and linear thermal bridges...|$|R
