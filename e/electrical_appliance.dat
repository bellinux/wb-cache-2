25|$|In 1987 most urban {{retail and}} service establishments, {{including}} state, collective, and private businesses or vendors, were located either in major downtown commercial districts {{or in small}} neighborhood shopping areas. The neighborhood shopping areas were numerous and were situated so {{that at least one}} was within easy walking distance of almost every household. They were able to supply nearly all the daily needs of their customers. A typical neighborhood shopping area in Beijing would contain a one-story department store, bookstore, hardware store, bicycle repair shop, combined tea shop and bakery, restaurant, theater, laundry, bank, post office, barbershop, photography studio, and <b>electrical</b> <b>appliance</b> repair shop. The department stores had small pharmacies and carried a substantial range of housewares, appliances, bicycles, toys, sporting goods, fabrics, and clothing. Major shopping districts in big cities contained larger versions of the neighborhood stores as well as numerous specialty shops, selling such items as musical instruments, sporting goods, hats, stationery, handicrafts, cameras, and clocks.|$|E
2500|$|A {{lampholder}} plug {{fits into}} the bayonet cap or Edison screw socket of a lampholder {{in place of a}} light bulb and enables an <b>electrical</b> <b>appliance</b> to be powered from a wall or ceiling light fitting.

Also, as in some countries (such as Italy) electricity was supplied on a [...] "split tariff" [...] basis with electricity for lighting being charged at a lower rate than that for other purposes, lampholder plugs enabled the consumers to reduce their electricity costs and were thus in broad use.|$|E
