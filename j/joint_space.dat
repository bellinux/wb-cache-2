5|$|In March, NASA was {{studying}} {{the possibility of}} flying the first Apollo mission as a <b>joint</b> <b>space</b> rendezvous with the final Project Gemini mission, Gemini 12 in November 1966. But by May, delays in making Apollo ready for flight just by itself, and the extra time needed to incorporate compatibility with the Gemini, made that impractical. This became moot when slippage in readiness of the AS-204 spacecraft caused the last-quarter 1966 target date to be missed, and the mission was rescheduled for February 21, 1967.|$|E
5|$|If non-surgical {{measures}} are unsuccessful, drilling {{may be considered}} to stimulate healing of the subchondral bone. Arthroscopic drilling may be performed by using an antegrade (from the front) approach from the <b>joint</b> <b>space</b> through the articular cartilage, or by using a retrograde (from behind) approach through the bone outside of the joint to avoid penetration of the articular cartilage. This has proven successful with positive results at one-year follow-up with antegrade drilling in nine out of eleven teenagers with the juvenile form of OCD, and in 18 of 20 skeletally immature people (follow-up of five years) who had failed prior conservative programs.|$|E
40|$|Normal <b>joint</b> <b>spacing</b> {{is either}} {{measured}} directly from parallel joint {{members of the}} same set or indirectly obtained from the apparent <b>joint</b> <b>spacing</b> measurements. The latter is achieved by considering the geometrical relationship between the joint orientation and the scanline/rock core orientation. In common practice, one can compute either an individual weighting factor for each member in the joint set, or only one weighting factor for the entire joint set based on the mean joint set orientation. These methods yield the same normal <b>joint</b> <b>spacing</b> values if the joint members are perfectly parallel. However, natural joints are rarely perfectly parallel, resulting in the discrepancy (error) of normal <b>joint</b> <b>spacing.</b> In this paper, another means for determining the normal <b>joint</b> <b>spacing</b> from apparent <b>joint</b> <b>spacing</b> based on the geometrical relationship between the scanline orientation and the averaged orientation of two adjacent joint {{members of the same}} set is examined. A detailed analysis is conducted on different sizes of randomly-generated joint set data with respect to differently oriented scanlines. The absolute error of the normal <b>joint</b> <b>spacing</b> calculations obtained by proposed method, which is found to be always smaller than that by the conventional practice, is thus recommended. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} the calculation analysis of joint open, {{and the research}} has been carried up on Portland cement concrete pavement and rubberized concrete pavement with the consideration of hogging distortion caused by temperature, expansion deformation and drying shrinkage. Finally,it were observed that joint open of 6 m contraction <b>joint</b> <b>spacing</b> for rubberized concrete pavement {{is the same as}} 4. 5 m contraction <b>joint</b> <b>spacing</b> for Portland cement concrete pavement. The above analysis provides the possibility of 6 -meter contraction <b>joint</b> <b>spacing</b> for rubberized concrete pavement which give theoretical basis for engineering application...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this study, {{two main}} failure modes of jointed rock {{foundations}} consisting general shear failure and failure due to excessive deformation are discussed. For {{each of these}} two modes, the method of determining ultimate bearing capacity is presented {{and the effect of}} <b>joint</b> <b>spacing</b> is also examined. For the former mode, an upper bound method of limit analysis is employed, while for the latter one, distinct element numerical modeling is used to investigate the effect of <b>joint</b> <b>spacing</b> on the bearing capacity. The calculations are performed for a rock mass containing two orthogonal joint sets that the orientation angle of the first joint set is 15 °, 30 ° and 45 ° to the horizontal, respectively. A non-dimensional parameter called “Spacing Ratio” (SR) is used to examine the effect of different <b>joint</b> <b>spacing.</b> This study shows {{that in the case of}} general shear failure mode, <b>joint</b> <b>spacing</b> does not have significant effect on the bearing capacity. In the failure mode induced by excessive deformation of the rock mass, for SR 30, the <b>joint</b> <b>spacing</b> does not significantly affect the bearing capacity...|$|R
5|$|OCD {{is caused}} by blood {{deprivation}} in the subchondral bone. This loss of blood flow causes the subchondral bone {{to die in a}} process called avascular necrosis. The bone is then reabsorbed by the body, leaving the articular cartilage it supported prone to damage. The result is fragmentation (dissection) of both cartilage and bone, and the free movement of these bone and cartilage fragments within the <b>joint</b> <b>space,</b> causing pain and further damage. OCD can be difficult to diagnose because these symptoms are found with other diseases. However, the disease can be confirmed by X-rays, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, NASA planned {{to launch a}} modular space station called Freedom as a {{counterpart}} to Mir, while the Soviets were planning to construct Mir-2 in the 1990s {{as a replacement for}} the station. Because of budget and design constraints, Freedom never progressed past mock-ups and minor component tests and, with the fall of the Soviet Union {{and the end of the}} Space Race, the project was nearly cancelled entirely by the United States House of Representatives. The post-Soviet economic chaos in Russia also led to the cancellation of Mir-2, though only after its base block, DOS-8, had been constructed. Similar budgetary difficulties were faced by other nations with space station projects, which prompted the US government to negotiate with European states, Russia, Japan, and Canada in the early 1990s to begin a collaborative project. In June 1992, American president George H. W. Bush and Russian president Boris Yeltsin agreed to cooperate on space exploration. The resulting Agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation Concerning Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for Peaceful Purposes called for a short <b>joint</b> <b>space</b> programme with one American astronaut deployed to the Russian space station Mir and two Russian cosmonauts deployed to a Space Shuttle.|$|E

40|$|In bedded {{sedimentary}} or mechanically anisotropic rocks, joints {{often occur}} in laterally persistent, parallel sets with distinctive spacing attributes. Three of those attributes include a positively skewed distribution of joint spacings, {{a positive correlation}} between median spacing and mechanical layer thickness, and the tendency for rocks to appear saturated with joints and to show a ratio of layer thickness to median <b>joint</b> <b>spacing</b> near one. We identify total applied strain, mechanical interaction, joint propagation velocity, and flaws as key variables in the progressive jointing process, and we use a one-dimensional model of mechanically interacting joints to characterize the specific influence on <b>joint</b> <b>spacing,</b> of the number, sizes, and size distributions of flaws in rock. For a given flaw size distribution, the mode flaw size has no effect on spacing distribution shape, median spacing, or saturation. Layers with fewer flaws approach saturation more slowly and reach it with fewer joints and larger median <b>joint</b> <b>spacing.</b> The <b>joint</b> <b>spacing</b> distributions in these layers have variance and skewness that may be 1 – 3 orders of magnitude larger than in layers with greater numbers of flaws. Flaw size range affects the rate at which a jointing layer approaches saturation but not the number of joints at saturation. Resulting spacing distributions are similar, although narrow flaw size ranges tend to promote greater numbers of closely <b>spaced</b> <b>joints.</b> The skewness of a flaw size distribution affects the rate at which layers approach saturation, as well as the shape of the resulting <b>joint</b> <b>spacing</b> distribution at saturation. Negatively skewed flaw size distributions promote close <b>joint</b> <b>spacing</b> and create spacing distributions with greater variance and skewness...|$|R
25|$|Cytokines and chemokines {{attract and}} {{accumulate}} immune cells, i.e. activated T- and B cells, monocytes and macrophages from activated fibroblasts, in the <b>joint</b> <b>space.</b> By signalling through RANKL and RANK they eventually trigger osteoclast production, which degrades bone tissue.|$|E
25|$|The {{shoulder}} {{consists of}} a ball-and-socket joint formed by the humerus and scapula and their surrounding structures - ligaments, muscles, tendons - which support the bones and maintain the relationship of one to another. These supporting structures attach to the clavicle, humerus, and scapula, the latter providing the glenoid cavity, acromion and coracoid processes. The main joint of the shoulder is the shoulder joint (or glenohumeral joint), between the humerus and the glenoid process of the scapular. The acromioclavicular joint and sternoclavicular joint {{also play a role}} in shoulder movements. White hyaline cartilage on the ends of the bones (called articular cartilage) allows the bones to glide and move on each other, and the <b>joint</b> <b>space</b> is surrounded by a synovial membrane. Around the <b>joint</b> <b>space</b> are muscles - the rotator cuff, which directly surrounds and attaches to the shoulder joint - and other muscles that help provide stability and facilitate movement.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis is {{made with}} {{reasonable}} certainty based on history and clinical examination. X-rays may confirm the diagnosis.

Plain films may not correlate with the findings on physical examination or with the degree of pain. Usually other imaging techniques are not necessary to clinically diagnose osteoarthritis.|$|E

25|$|Besides {{parameter}} estimation, the ABC-framework {{can be used}} {{to compute}} the posterior probabilities of different candidate models. In such applications, one possibility is to use the rejection-sampling in a hierarchical manner. First, a model is sampled from the prior distribution for the models; then, given the model sampled, the model parameters are sampled from the prior distribution assigned to that model. Finally, a simulation is performed as in the single-model ABC. The relative acceptance frequencies for the different models now approximate the posterior distribution for these models. Again, computational improvements for ABC in the space of models have been proposed, such as constructing a particle filter in the <b>joint</b> <b>space</b> of models and parameters.|$|E

25|$|Osteochondrosis is a {{disturbance}} {{in the normal}} development of cartilage; cartilage becomes abnormally thickened, and small fissures and cracks may develop. Dissecans is when cartilage becomes dissected resulting in cartilage flaps, which may remain attached or become loose and fall into the <b>joint</b> <b>space.</b> In Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs most of these cases occur in the shoulder joints and occasionally in elbows and hocks. Except for very mild cases without flap development, the clinical signs are persistent or intermittent lameness. The dog may be stiff after resting and the lameness is usually aggravated by exercise. It is diagnosed by x-rays, and treatment depends on {{the severity of the}} case. Mild cases without cartilage flaps may be treated and heal with several weeks of rest and treatment with medication and supplements. Many cases require surgery to remove the flaps and loose fragments, and scraping and smoothing of the defective surface. Surgical repair of the shoulder usually has excellent results, surgical results involving other sites are not as predictable.|$|E

Glacial {{erosion and}} bedrock {{properties}} in NW Scotland: Abrasion and plucking, hardness and <b>joint</b> <b>spacing.</b> Geomorphology, 130 (3 - 4), 374 - 383. Subglacial erosion beneath glaciers occurs predominantly by abrasion and plucking, producing distinct erosional forms. The {{controls on the}} relative importance of abrasion vs. plucking are poorly understood. On the one hand, glacial conditions that favour or suppress cavity formation (ice velocity, ice thickness, and water pressure) are thought to favour plucking or abrasion, respectively. Conversely, bedrock properties are also known to control landforms, but this has rarely been analysed quantitatively. In this study we compare landforms and bedrock properties of sandstone and quartzite at the bed of a palaeo-ice stream near Ullapool in NW Scotland. The boundary between the rock types is at right angles to the westward palaeo-ice flow, and palaeoglacial conditions on both rock types were similar. We report quantitative parameters for bedrock properties (Schmidt hammer hardness and <b>joint</b> <b>spacing)</b> and use morphometric parameters to analyse the landforms. Torridon sandstone is soft but thick-bedded and with a wide <b>joint</b> <b>spacing.</b> Erosional bedforms include roche moutonnees with smoothed tops and concave stoss sides, whalebacks, and elongate p-forms, indicating a high proportion of abrasion over plucking. Cambrian quartzite is hard but thin-bedded with narrow <b>joint</b> <b>spacing.</b> Erosional landforms are angular to subangular with abundant plucked lee faces, suggesting a high proportion of plucking over abrasion. Hardness and <b>joint</b> <b>spacing</b> thus exert a strong control on subglacial erosional landforms and the mechanisms that formed them. Thus glacial conditions (ice velocity, ice thickness) can only be inferred from glacial erosional landforms if the effects of bedrock properties of the substrate are considered.

40|$|Fracture {{toughness}} (FT) and {{tensile strength}} (TS) indicate a rock's susceptibility to fracturing. Past {{studies showed that}} mechanical properties and FT of homogeneous rocks can be correlated well. In the present study, this capability has been extended to the jointed sedimentary rocks. Sandstone with a wide combination of analogue joints were tested in the laboratory, and the control of joint geometrical properties on the FT, TS, and development of fracture process zone (FPZ) were investigated. A FT prediction model was developed based on the TS of the jointed specimens. Multifractal scaling law (MFSL) was utilized to extend the laboratory results to the field scale. Further, the interaction of propagating crack with the already existing joints were investigated and post-peak behavior were studied. Results show that FT and TS decrease with decreasing <b>joint</b> <b>spacing,</b> but they are more sensitive at higher <b>joint</b> <b>spacing.</b> It is also possible to construct a linear prediction model between the FT and TS of rock. FPZ of jointed rock is less sensitive to joint orientation and more related to <b>joint</b> <b>spacing.</b> A negative correlation between the FPZ size and <b>joint</b> <b>spacing</b> is established in this study. Post-peak behavior of the jointed specimens indicate that crack-joint interaction increases the frictional resistance and dissipated fracture energy of the specimens. Further, comparison of mixed-mode fracture criteria with the experimental results show that Maximum Tangential Stress (MTS) criterion can successfully predict the mixed-mode fracture behavior of jointed sandstone...|$|R
