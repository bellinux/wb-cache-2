Patents have a limited duration, usually a period of at least 20 years.

This paper provides two examples of this kind; a photo-chemical solar energy converter and an envisioned synthetic method of producing a proton-conductive lubricating oil.

The Szalinskis' next door neighbors, the Thompsons, are getting ready for a fishing trip, but Russ' oldest son Little Russ is less than enthusiastic, as he and his father's interests often clash, resulting in him feeling belittled, and he is more interested in meeting Amy than spending the weekend camping. Younger son Ron, however, is enthusiastic, though his relationship with Russ Sr. is strained when he inadvertently sets off a booby trap in the yard.|$|R

40|$|The Eskimos are {{a remarkably}} {{successful}} group of mankind. Their {{ability to adapt}} to difficult circumstances and to expand is accurately reflected in their geographical distribution. They stretch longitudinally around a large sector of the circumpolar world, and latitudinally from the subarctic into the high Arctic. With their closest relatives, the Aleuts, they occupy the longest linear distance of any single group in the world. Although this unique geographical distribution provides objective and conclusive evidence {{of their ability to}} expand, rather than simply survive, it does not automatically elucidate the processes of adaptation which are responsible. We must look at individual Eskimos and at communities of Eskimos through the methods of many disciplines, and then sift and integrate this information within the larger context of their population systems. Their physical abilities, their inventiveness, and their cheerfulness are as well known to the world as the words “Eskimo, ” “igloo, ” and “kayak. ” However, we do not know to what extent there are organic connections between physical endowments, genetic variability, <b>inventive</b> <b>ingenuity,</b> and cheerfulness <b>of</b> dis...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{framework}} for assessing innovation collaboration partners. Based on the studies explaining the internationalisation <b>of</b> <b>inventive</b> activity, we identify four elements relevant as drivers of innovation collaboration. These elements include inventive capacity, technological specialisation patterns, openness to international innovation collaboration and economic potential of technology. In {{order to make the}} framework operational, we propose a set of patent-based indicators that capture the relevant elements. This way the proposed framework serves as a tool to both assess the potential <b>of</b> <b>inventive</b> collaboration and to anticipate benefits of such collaboration. In a second step, we apply the framework to analyse the attractiveness of BRIC countries as potential partners for innovation collaboration. Our analysis shows that BRICs do not only differ in terms <b>of</b> <b>inventive</b> performance, but also in terms of the openness to international collaboration or the economic potential of technology developed by these countries.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} ways in which war {{machines}} are elaborated within Rabelais’s narrative, and how they align with – or challenge – the moralising discourse surrounding technology in the mid-sixteenth century. Through close reading of the Gaster and Andouilles episodes, it argues that the ambiguity of the term engin, which is used to refer both to <b>inventive</b> <b>ingenuity</b> and its physical products, provides a rich seam in Rabelais’s fourth book for the exploration of the boundary between nature and artifice. As such antitheses come under strain, so on the other hand do analogous pairings prove to reveal significant differences. Engins are caught up, in Rabelais’s text, in a complex web of associations that includes poetic and technological invention, political leadership, religious worship, and, repeatedly, food. As this web of themes is mapped, it becomes apparent that tripe, in particular, plays a prominent role in mediating a series of symbolic relationships. From the stomach-god whose actions are described by the refrain ‘Et tout pour la trippe’, to the army of tripe sausages who worship a flying pig, the traditional epic association of battle and banquet is recast by Rabelais’s own extraordinary engin...|$|R

The level <b>of</b> <b>inventive</b> thinking surveyed in this study involved 660 students who were selected from five national secondary schools from the area of Machang, Kelantan. Seven inventive thinking sub-constructs reviewed were flexibility, higher-order thinking, self-regulation, curiosity, creativity, willingness to take risks and spiritual norms and values. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistic. The descriptive analysis found that six out of seven sub-constructs <b>of</b> <b>inventive</b> thinking studied showed a high level among the respondents as a whole.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we attempt to}} provide an {{analytical}} framework relating market structure to the nature <b>of</b> <b>inventive</b> activity. In doing so {{we have come to}} modify this neo-Schumpeterian view in a fundamental way. We shall argue that except in the short run both market structure and the nature <b>of</b> <b>inventive</b> activity are endogenous; that the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> concentration in an industry ought not to be treated as given, as it recently has been in the industrial organisation literature; that they both depend on more basic ingredients, such as the technology of research, demand conditions, the nature of the capital market (i. e. market rates of interest, and the ability of firms to borrow to finance research and development (R and D), and the legal structure (e. g. patent rights). We shall, to be sure, explore the relationship between the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> concentration and the nature of innovative activity. But as they are both endogenous, their relationship, unlike the neo-Schumpeterian thesis, ought not to be regarded as a causal one. A major objective of our study is to formulate models within which the efficiency of a market economy can be assessed and where the tradeoff between a temporal production efficiency and dynamic gains can be meaningfully discussed. In this paper we are concerned with process innovation (i. e. R and D designed to reduce cost of production). This means that attention is drawn to the distribution of extreme values. This in turn implies, as was noted by Evenson and Kieslev (1975), that even risk-averse firms might wish to engage in randomisation...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the effects of institutions on national rates <b>of</b> <b>inventive</b> activity. Invention, part of the innovation process, is acknowledged as one of the driving forces behind economic growth, and patent statistics are frequently used as a measurable indicator <b>of</b> <b>inventive</b> output. Thus this paper explores the relationship between national patent statistics and measures of institutional quality. As a result of our research, the effect of the “threshold <b>of</b> <b>inventive</b> activity” was observed. This effect demonstrates that when countries reach a certain level of institutional development and attain a general institutional climate conducive to inventive activity, the number of patent applications begins to sharply increase. The paper contributes to the body of evidence that confirms that a combination of fundamental institutions like the rule of law or freedom of expression, which are not necessarily aimed at boosting innovation, create an overall environment conducive to patenting. We demonstrate that “mid-range emerging economies”, 2 including those in Central and Eastern Europe 3 (CEE), where the quality of institutions is lagging behind more developed counterparts and/or their influence is weak or sporadic, have not yet reached the threshold <b>of</b> <b>inventive</b> activity yet. However, those CEE countries that have acceded to the European Union first have made visible progress with respect to institutional quality and invention...|$|R
