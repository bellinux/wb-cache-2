Diefenbaker promised to expand the national health <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> to cover tubercular and mental health patients. He characterized the old age pension increase which the Liberal government was instituting as a mere pittance, not even enough {{to keep up with the}} cost of living. Diefenbaker noted that the increase only amounted to twenty cents a day, using that figure to ridicule Liberal contentions that an increase would add to the rate of inflation. All three opposition parties promised to increase the pension, with the Social Crediters and CCF even stating the specific amounts it would be raised by.|$|E

5|$|The new {{voting system}} {{increased}} the socialists' influence in parliament significantly, but its major beneficiaries were the Catholic Party. Partly {{as a result}} of the creation of a Catholic populist challenger, the Christian People's Party, the Catholic Party embraced the new ideology of Social Catholicism introduced following the papal Rerum novarum encyclical of 1891. This gained it considerable popular support, especially in Flanders. In 1894, the Belgian Workers' Party adopted the Charter of Quaregnon, which would form the basis of its ideology until 1979. By 1911, the party had 276,000 members, making it one of the most successful Socialist parties in Europe. As a result of lobbying by the Belgian Workers' Party, Belgium was one of the first countries in Europe to launch a comprehensive social <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme,</b> including sickness compensation (from 1894), voluntary old-age insurance (1900) and unemployment insurance (1907). The big losers from voting reform were the Liberals who lost almost all their parliamentary representation in the years between 1894 and 1900.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the rapid ascent of Ford and members of his faction to the state's major {{political}} offices, he and Carroll were investigated in a corruption probe. The four-year investigation began in 1977 and focused on a state insurance kickback scheme alleged to have operated during Ford's tenure. In June 1972, Ford had purchased insurance policies for state workers from some of his political backers without competitive bidding. State law did not require competitive bidding, and earlier governors had engaged in similar practices. Investigators believed there was an arrangement in which insurance companies getting government contracts split commissions with party officials, although Ford was suspected of allowing the practice for political benefit rather than personal financial gain. In 1981, prosecutors asked for indictments against Ford and Carroll on racketeering charges but a grand jury refused. Because grand jury proceedings are secret, what exactly occurred has never been publicly revealed. However, state Republicans maintained that Ford took the Fifth Amendment while on the stand, invoking his right against self-incrimination. Ford refused to confirm or deny this report. A federal grand jury recommended that Ford be indicted in connection with the <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme,</b> but the U.S. Department of Justice did not act on this recommendation.|$|E

40|$|Deposit <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> were an {{important}} element in policy responses to the global financial crisis (GFC). There has been considerable debate about the nature and efficacy of such policy measures in alleviating the fallout from financial crises. The GFC highlighted problems associated with deposit <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> including moral hazard, coverage limits, co-insurance, cross border issues and market distortions. Despite these shortcomings, deposit <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> were able to ameliorate the financial panic experienced and reduce contagion. This paper evaluates the Australian and New Zealand experience with deposit insurance introduced in response to the GFC, and compares this to the OECD experience.

25|$|The {{idea for}} the National Health <b>Insurance</b> <b>Scheme</b> (NHIS) in Ghana was {{conceived}} by former president John Kufuor who when seeking {{the mandate of the}} people in the 2000 elections, promised to abolish the “cash and carry system” of health delivery. Upon becoming president, former president Kufuor pushed through his idea of getting rid of “cash and carry” and replacing it with an equitable <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> that ensured that treatment was provided first before payment. In 2003, the scheme was passed into law. Under the law, there was the establishment of National Health Insurance Authority which licenses, monitors and regulates the operation of health insurance schemes in Ghana. Like many countries in the world, Ghana's health insurance was fashioned out to meet specific needs of its citizens. Since its inception, the country's health facilities have seen constant rise in patient numbers and a considerable reduction in deaths.|$|E

40|$|In the 1990 ies the {{ultimate}} target {{of social security}} has been widened: Social security aims at protecting people against life risks and helping them {{to take advantage of}} social and economic opportunities. Existing social security systems in rural areas of developing countries are often â€œsecond best solutionsâ€ and need reforms. Institutional innovations such as micro <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> are a promising way of improving the risk management of rural households. The example of community based health <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> in Senegal shows, that rural households can be successfully integrated into <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes.</b> This allows a better access to health care and is an essential prerequisite for increasing labour productivity. Moreover, it offers in the mid to long term the chance to shift to more risky but also more profitable production systems. The discussion of the appropriate design of social security in rural areas of developing countries has yet started. Many questions are still open as e. g. the willingness of rural households to pay for insurance products, the optimal design of micro <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> and the measurement of the effects of social security on productivity. Agricultural economics research can make substantial contributions in answering these questions. social security, micro <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes,</b> developing countries, Community/Rural/Urban Development, Health Economics and Policy, International Development,...|$|R

40|$|Background: Health {{inequity}} is {{an important}} issue all around the world. The Chinese basic medical security system comprises three major <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes,</b> namely the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI), the Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI), and the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS). Little research has been conducted to look into the disparity in payments among the health <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> in China. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the disparity in reimbursements for tuberculosis (TB) care among the abovementioned health <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes.</b> Methods: This study uses a World Health Organization (WHO) framework to analyze the disparities and equity relating to the three dimensions of health insurance: population coverage, the range of services covered, {{and the extent to which}} costs are covered. Each of the health <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme’s</b> policies were categorized and analyzed. An analysis of the claims database of all hospitalizations reimbursed from 2010 to 2012 in three counties of Yichang city (YC), which included 1506 discharges, was conducted to identify the differences in reimbursement rates and out-of-pocket (OOP) expenses among the health <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes.</b> Results: Tuberculosis patients had various inpatient expenses depending on which scheme they were covered by (TB patients covered by the NCMS have less inpatient expenses than those who were covered by the URBMI, who have less inpatient expenses than those covered by the UEBMI). We found a significant horizontal inequity of healthcare utilization among the lower socioeconomic groups. In terms of financial inequity, TB patients who earned less paid more. The NCMS provides modest financial protection, based on income. Overall, TB patients from lower socioeconomic groups were the most vulnerable. Conclusion: There are large disparities in reimbursement for TB care among the three health <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> and this, in turn, hampers TB control. Reducing the gap in health outcomes between the three health <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> in China should be a focus of TB care and control. Achieving equity through integrated policies that avoid discrimination is likely to be effective...|$|R
