5|$|The Maya were keen {{observers}} of the sun, stars, and planets. E-Groups were a particular arrangement of temples that were relatively common in the Maya region; they take their names from Group E at Uaxactun. They consisted of three small structures facing a fourth structure, and were used to mark the solstices and <b>equinoxes.</b> The earliest examples date to the Preclassic period. The Lost World complex at Tikal started out as an E-Group built {{towards the end of}} the Middle Preclassic. Due to its nature, the basic layout of an E-Group was constant. A structure was built on the west side of a plaza; it was usually a radial pyramid with stairways facing the cardinal directions. It faced east across the plaza to three small temples on the far side. From the west pyramid, the sun was seen to rise over these temples on the solstices and <b>equinoxes.</b> E-Groups were raised across the central and southern Maya area for over a millennium; not all were properly aligned as observatories, and their function may have been symbolic.|$|E
5|$|As well as E-Groups, the Maya built other {{structures}} dedicated to observing {{the movements of}} celestial bodies. Many Maya buildings were aligned with astronomical bodies, including the planet Venus, and various constellations. The Caracol structure at Chichen Itza was a circular multi-level edifice, with a conical superstructure. It has slit windows that marked the movements of Venus. At Copán, a pair of stelae were raised to mark {{the position of the}} setting sun at the <b>equinoxes.</b>|$|E
5|$|By astronomical convention, {{the four}} seasons can be {{determined}} by the solstices—the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun—and the <b>equinoxes,</b> when the direction of the tilt and the direction to the Sun are perpendicular. In the Northern Hemisphere, winter solstice currently occurs around 21 December; summer solstice is near 21 June, spring equinox is around 20 March and autumnal equinox is about 22 or 23 September. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.|$|E

5|$|The First Point of Aries, the {{location}} of the vernal equinox, is named for the constellation. This is because the Sun crossed the celestial equator from south to north in Aries more than two millennia ago. Hipparchus defined it in 130 BC. as a point south of Gamma Arietis. Because of the precession of the <b>equinoxes,</b> the First Point of Aries has since moved into Pisces and will move into Aquarius by around 2600 AD. The Sun now appears in Aries from late April through mid May, though the constellation is still associated with the beginning of spring.|$|E

Over the course of Tikal's history the E-Group underwent seven distinct construction phases, with the earliest dating {{to the end of}} the Middle Preclassic period.|$|E
5|$|This type of sundial {{is known}} as an {{equatorial}} sundial because {{the plane of the}} dial face is parallel to the Earth's equatorial plane. Two primary examples of modified equatorial sundials are bowstring equatorial and armillary dials. Both of these modified equatorial sundials can be read year-round on the same surface, regardless of whether the Sun is above or below the equatorial plane whereas a standard equatorial sundial changes sides with each equinox and is virtually unreadable near the <b>equinoxes</b> when the Sun is located on the equatorial plane.|$|E
5|$|Each {{night the}} {{positions}} of the stars appear to change as the Earth rotates. However, when a star is located along the Earth's axis of rotation, it will remain in the same position and thus is called a pole star. The direction of the Earth's axis of rotation gradually changes over time in a process known as the precession of the <b>equinoxes.</b> A complete precession cycle requires 25,770years, during which time the pole of the Earth's rotation follows a circular path across the celestial sphere that passes near several prominent stars. At present the pole star is Polaris, but around 12,000 BC the pole was pointed only five degrees away from Vega. Through precession, the pole will again pass near Vega around AD 14,000. It is the brightest of the successive northern pole stars.|$|E

5000|$|An <b>equinox</b> {{occurs when}} the earth is at a {{position}} in its orbit such that a vector from the earth toward the sun points to where the ecliptic intersects the celestial equator. The <b>equinox</b> which occurs near {{the first day of}} spring (w.r.t. North hemisphere) is called the vernal <b>equinox.</b> The vernal <b>equinox</b> {{can be used as a}} principal direction for ECI frames. [...] The Sun lies in the direction of the vernal <b>equinox</b> around 21 March. The fundamental plane for ECI frames is usually either the equatorial plane or the ecliptic.|$|R
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the year {{different}} sections of the rod serve as the style, which is the part of the gnomon that indicates the time by casting its shadow on the dial face. At the summer solstice, when the Sun is highest (farthest above the equatorial plane), the style is closest to the top of the rod, and at the winter solstice, when the Sun is lowest, it is closest to the bottom. At the <b>equinoxes,</b> when the Sun is on the equatorial plane, the style is exactly in the center of the length of the rod. The style of the equatorial sundial is parallel to the Earth's axis of rotation.|$|E
5|$|The largest bores occur {{around the}} times of the <b>equinoxes</b> but smaller ones can be seen {{throughout}} the year. There are about 260 bores in each year occurring twice a day on 130 days. Because the bores {{are associated with the}} phases of the moon, one occurs between 7 a.m. and noon on bore days, and the other between 7 p.m. and midnight GMT, with the largest bores occurring between 9 and 11 in both the morning and evening. Maximum bores occur between one and three days after new and full moons, and smaller ones on the days that precede and follow the maxima.|$|E
5|$|The {{orientation}} of Earth's axis and equator are not fixed in space, but rotate about the poles of the ecliptic with {{a period of}} about 26,000 years, a process known as lunisolar precession, as it is due mostly to the gravitational effect of the Moon and Sun on Earth's equatorial bulge. Likewise, the ecliptic itself is not fixed. The gravitational perturbations of the other bodies of the Solar System cause a much smaller motion of the plane of Earth's orbit, and hence of the ecliptic, known as planetary precession. The combined action of these two motions is called general precession, and changes the position of the <b>equinoxes</b> by about 50 arc seconds (about 0.014°) per year.|$|E
5|$|Because of the precessional {{motion of}} the <b>equinox,</b> the {{ecliptic}} coordinates of objects on the celestial sphere are continuously changing. Specifying a position in ecliptic coordinates requires specifying a particular <b>equinox,</b> that is, the <b>equinox</b> of a particular date, known as an epoch; the coordinates are referred to {{the direction of the}} <b>equinox</b> at that date. For instance, the Astronomical Almanac lists the heliocentric position of Mars at 0h Terrestrial Time, 4 Jan 2010 as: longitude 118° 09' 15".8, latitude +1° 43' 16".7, true heliocentric distance 1.6302454 AU, mean <b>equinox</b> and ecliptic of date.

5|$|There is {{no clear}} {{evidence}} that the classic Maya were aware of precession. Some Maya scholars, such as Barbara MacLeod, Michael Grofe, Eva Hunt, Gordon Brotherston, and Anthony Aveni, have suggested that some Mayan holy dates were timed to precessional cycles, but scholarly opinion on the subject remains divided. There is also little evidence, archaeological or historical, that the Maya placed any importance on solstices or <b>equinoxes.</b> It is possible that only the earliest among Mesoamericans observed solstices, but {{this is also a}} disputed issue among Mayanists. There is also no evidence that the classic Maya attached any importance to the Milky Way; there is no glyph in their writing system to represent it, and no astronomical or chronological table tied to it.|$|E
5|$|To {{test this}} idea he {{surveyed}} hundreds of stone rows and circles. Any individual alignment could indicate a direction by chance, but {{he planned to}} show that together the distribution of alignments was non-random, showing {{that there was an}} astronomical intent to the orientation of {{at least some of the}} alignments. His results indicated the existence of eight, sixteen, or perhaps even thirty-two approximately equal divisions of the year. The two solstices, the two <b>equinoxes</b> and four cross-quarter days, days half-way between a solstice and the equinox were associated with the medieval Celtic calendar. While not all these conclusions have been accepted, it has had an enduring influence on archaeoastronomy, especially in Europe.|$|E
5|$|A {{visually}} striking {{effect is}} seen every March and September as an unusual shadow occurs around the <b>equinoxes.</b> A shadow appears to descend the west balustrade {{of the northern}} stairway. The visual effect is of a serpent descending the stairway, with its head at the base in light. Additionally the western face points to sunset around 25 May, traditionally the date of transition from the dry to the rainy season. The intended alignment was, however, likely incorporated in the northern (main) facade of the temple, as it corresponds to sunsets on May 20 and July 24, recorded also by the central axis of Castillo at Tulum.. The two dates are separated by 65 and 300 days, {{and it has been}} shown that the solar orientations in Mesoamerica regularly correspond to dates separated by calendrically significant intervals (multiples of 13 and 20 days).|$|E
