50|$|The <b>dimorphic</b> <b>egret</b> can {{sometime}} {{be found}} on rooftops, finding insects in the gutters of houses.|$|E
50|$|The <b>dimorphic</b> <b>egret</b> (Egretta dimorpha) is {{a species}} of heron in the family Ardeidae. It is found in Comoros, Kenya, Madagascar, Mayotte, Seychelles, and Tanzania.|$|E
50|$|Three other egret taxa have {{at times}} been {{classified}} as subspecies {{of the little}} egret {{in the past but}} are now regarded as two separate species. These are the western reef heron Egretta gularis which occurs on the coastline of West Africa (Egretta gularis gularis) and from the Red Sea to India (Egretta gularis schistacea), and the <b>dimorphic</b> <b>egret</b> Egretta dimorpha, found in East Africa, Madagascar, the Comoros and the Aldabra Islands.|$|E
5000|$|The {{island has}} been {{identified}} as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports a large and diverse population of breeding seabirds and other waterbirds. It is the only known breeding site outside Aldabra and Madagascar for Malagasy pond herons. Seabirds include the second largest colony in the western Indian Ocean of great frigatebirds (with up to 1100 pairs), Audubon's shearwaters (up to 100 pairs, probably of the subspecies Puffinus lherminieri bailloni previously considered endemic to the Mascarene Islands), <b>dimorphic</b> <b>egrets</b> and Caspian terns.|$|R
50|$|This ibis nests colonially, {{sometimes}} with mixed heron {{species such as}} the Humblot’s heron or egret species such as cattle egret and <b>dimorphic</b> <b>egret.</b> The nest lies 2-3m above {{the surface of the}} water in forks of Avicennia and Rhizophora trees and largely comprises twigs, some of which are still living with leaves attached. The nest is structurally sturdy and measures 450-500mm across and 250mm deep. Other nests have been reported to be smaller, measuring approximately 250mm across.|$|E
5000|$|The Madagascan {{population}} has been markedly declining mainly through unsustainable harvesting of eggs, nest site disturbance and wetland habitat degradation. [...] Human interference and habitat loss also pose threats to the abbotti race. Because nesting individuals are apparently fearless of humans, this species is {{an easy target for}} hunters. Habitat loss and degradation pose another serious threat to the population. Important areas of this species’ habitat are threatened with pollution, sedimentation and encroachment of alluvial sands. Such sedimentation is caused by soil erosion from slash and burn cultivation (Birdlife International, 2013). Its mangrove habitat is also threatened with destruction for charcoal production. This ibis may further be in competition for food with egret species such as the <b>dimorphic</b> <b>egret.</b>|$|E
50|$|This bird has two plumage colour forms. There is {{an all-white}} morph {{and a dark}} grey morph; morphs can also occur with {{intermediate}} shades of grey which {{may be related to}} age or particoloured in grey and white. The white morph is similar in general appearance to the little egret, but has a larger yellower bill, extended yellow on thicker legs, and when foraging tends to be very active, sometimes also moving its wing or using it to shade the water surface. The grey morph has a whitish throat and is unlikely to be confused with any other species within the range of this egret with beak and legs {{similar to that of the}} white morph. During the breeding season the legs and facial skin are reddish. Breeding birds have two long feathers on the sides of the nape. The nominate subspecies gularis has a range from West Africa to Gabon, with some birds breeding in southern Europe. Subspecies schistacea (Hemprich & Ehrenberg, 1828) breeds from the Persian Gulf along the coast of India to the east of the India Peninsula. The form on the eastern coast of South Africa is usually separated as the <b>dimorphic</b> <b>egret</b> Egretta dimorpha. The dark and white morph is thought to be controlled by a single allele with the dark character being incompletely dominant over the gene for white.|$|E
50|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} as Ardea gularis from a specimen obtained in Senegal by the French naturalist Louis Augustin Guillaume Bosc in 1792. The distinctive white throat (or gular region) {{in the dark}} morph gives it the species name. Later authors have treated it the genera Demiegretta (in which dimorphic egrets were once included), Herodias and Lepterodius until its current stable position in the genus Egretta. The distinctness of this species from Egretta garzetta has however been highly debated with some authors treating garzetta as a polytypic superspecies. There has been confusion related to what {{were thought to be}} dark little egrets and the possibility of hybrids. Dark morphs in little egrets are extremely rare and nearly all specimens of what were thought to be dark morphs {{have turned out to be}} western reef herons. In India some research claimed circumstantial evidence of interbreeding with little egrets, but the same researchers noted that the breeding seasons of the two species were different. Hybridization has also been claimed to occur in Morocco and Kenya (but this might refer to Egretta dimorpha). Christidis and Boles quote a report by McCracken and Sheldon (2002) that the nucleotide sequences of the cytochrome b genes from a sampled little egret and a western reef heron were identical and use this as evidence for demotion. The sequences and the origins of the samples are not publicly available or verifiable. In the past the Indian form which was also described as Ardea asha by William Henry Sykes has been treated as a subspecies of the little egret as Egretta garzetta schistacea on the basis of presumed hybridization with Egretta gularis. The lores of breeding little egrets are blue while those of the reef heron are reddish although some individuals of schistacea show blue and this is thought to be due to hybridization. The dark coastal form of Madagascar, Aldabra, Comoro Islands, Seychelles and parts of East Africa (southern Kenya to Tanzania) was earlier treated as a subspecies (the mainland African form has sometimes been considered as schistacea) but is now raised to full species as the <b>dimorphic</b> <b>egret</b> (Egretta dimorpha).|$|E
