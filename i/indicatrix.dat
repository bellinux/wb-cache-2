This allows two different procedures {{to be carried out}} to investigate the mineral under the crosshairs of the microscope. More simply, in ordinary cross polarized light, the plate can be used to distinguish the orientation of the optical <b>indicatrix</b> relative to crystal elongation – that is, whether the mineral is [...] "length slow" [...] or [...] "length fast" [...] – based on whether the visible interference colors increase or decrease by one order when the plate is added. A slightly more complex procedure allows for a tint plate to be used in conjunction with interference figure techniques to allow measurement of the optic angle of the mineral. The optic angle (often notated as [...] "2V") can both be diagnostic of mineral type, as well as in some cases revealing information about the variation of chemical composition within a single mineral type.|$|E

It is the geometry that results from projecting a circle of infinitesimal radius from a curved geometric model, such as a globe, onto a map. Tissot proved that the resulting diagram is an ellipse whose axes indicate the two principal directions along which scale is maximal and minimal at that point on the map.|$|E

50|$|In {{dealing with}} a Tissot <b>indicatrix,</b> {{different}} notions of radius come into play. The first is the infinitesimal radius of the original circle. The resulting ellipse of distortion will also have infinitesimal radius, but by the mathematics of differentials, the ratios of these infinitesimal values are finite. So, for example, if the resulting ellipse of distortion is the same size of infinitesimal as on the sphere, then its radius {{is considered to be}} 1. Lastly, the size that the <b>indicatrix</b> gets drawn for human inspection on the map is arbitrary. When a network of indicatrices is drawn on a map, they are all scaled by the same arbitrary amount so that their sizes are proportionally correct.|$|E

50|$|Baron Pierre Charles François Dupin (6 October 1784, Varzy, Nièvre - 18 January 1873, Paris, France) was a French Catholic mathematician, engineer, {{economist}} and politician, particularly known {{for work in}} the field of mathematics, where the Dupin cyclide and Dupin <b>indicatrix</b> are named after him; and for his {{work in the field}} of statistical and thematic mapping, In 1826 he created the earliest known choropleth map.|$|E

The ratio of the major axis to the minor axis is [...] Clearly {{the area of the}} ellipse increases by the same factor.|$|E
50|$|A single <b>indicatrix</b> {{describes}} the distortion {{at a single}} point. Because distortion varies across a map, generally Tissot's indicatrices are placed across a map to illustrate the spatial change in distortion. A common scheme places them at each intersection of displayed meridians and parallels. These schematics are important {{in the study of}} map projections, both to illustrate distortion and to provide the basis for the calculations that represent the magnitude of distortion precisely at each point.|$|E
5000|$|David M. Goldberg and J. Richard Gott III {{show that}} the Winkel tripel fares well against several other {{projections}} analyzed against their measures of distortion, producing small distance errors, small combinations of Tissot <b>indicatrix</b> ellipticity and area errors, and the smallest skewness {{of any of the}} projections they studied.By a different metric, Capek’s [...] "Q", the Winkel tripel ranked ninth among a hundred map projections of the world, behind the common Eckert IV projection and Robinson projections.|$|E

50|$|Nicolas Auguste Tissot (1824-1897) was a 19th-century French cartographer, who in 1859 and 1881 {{published}} {{an analysis of}} the distortion that occurs on map projections. He devised Tissot's <b>indicatrix,</b> or distortion circle, which when plotted on a map will appear as an ellipse whose elongation depends on the amount of distortion by the map at that point. The angle and extent of the elongation represents the amount of angular distortion of the map. The size of the ellipse indicates the amount that the area is distorted.|$|E
50|$|If {{the region}} of the map is small enough to ignore Earth's curvature—a town plan, for example—then a single value can be used as the scale without causing {{measurement}} errors. In maps covering larger areas, or the whole Earth, the map's scale may be less useful or even useless in measuring distances. The map projection becomes critical in understanding how scale varies throughout the map. When scale varies noticeably, it can be accounted for as the scale factor. Tissot's <b>indicatrix</b> is often used to illustrate the variation of point scale across a map.|$|E
50|$|Let's call a map {{projection}} locally conformal {{in a small}} domain on the earth if any angle in the domain is preserved {{in the image of}} the projection. Then any figure in the domain are nearly similar to the image on the map. This means that same lengths in the small domain are drawn as same lengths on the map (regardless of directions). Thus the projection in the small domain can be approximated by an isometric transformation. The Tissot's <b>indicatrix</b> of the projection around the domain is a circle.|$|E
50|$|Rather {{than the}} {{original}} (enlarged) infinitesimal circle as in Tissot's <b>indicatrix,</b> some visual methods project finite shapes that span {{a part of the}} map. For example, a small circle of fixed radius (e.g., 15-degrees angular radius). Sometimes spherical triangles are used.In {{the first half of the}} 20th century, projecting a human head onto different projections was common to show how distortion varies across one projection as compared to another.In dynamic media, shapes of familiar coastlines and boundaries can be dragged across an interactive map to show how the projection distorts sizes and shapes according to position on the map.|$|E
