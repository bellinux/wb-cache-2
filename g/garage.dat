5|$|Dubstep's early {{roots are}} in the more {{experimental}} releases of UK <b>garage</b> producers, seeking to incorporate elements of drum and bass into the South London-based 2-step <b>garage</b> sound. These experiments often {{ended up on the}} B-side of a white label or commercial <b>garage</b> release. Dubstep is generally instrumental. Similar to a vocal <b>garage</b> hybrid – grime – the genre's feel is commonly dark; tracks frequently use a minor key and can feature dissonant harmonies such as the tritone interval within a riff. Other distinguishing features often found are the use of samples, a propulsive, sparse rhythm, and an almost omnipresent sub-bass. Some dubstep artists have also incorporated a variety of outside influences, from dub-influenced techno such as Basic Channel to classical music or heavy metal.|$|E
50|$|<b>Garages</b> {{are often}} found where the attic {{entrance}} is located. Also used to store tools, bicycles and lawn equipment most <b>garages</b> have unfinished concrete flooring. Some <b>garages</b> include a separate storage room to partially alleviate this problem.|$|R
50|$|The {{facility}} has a 24 acre paddock that contains 220 team <b>garages,</b> 40 day <b>garages,</b> 27 grand prix <b>garages</b> located along the hot pits, an on-site medical facility, five million dollar Club House, vintage car museum, and a helicopter pad.|$|R
5|$|Nine new <b>garages</b> {{were built}} {{at the end of}} the pit lane, {{replacing}} the four temporary <b>garages</b> that had been built a few years earlier. The additional <b>garages</b> allowed the ACO to increase the number of entries it could grant from 50 to 55. The paddock behind the <b>garages</b> was also re-organized with more facilities added for spectators, including more shops, new landscaping, and the Audi Tower monument.|$|R
5|$|In 1939, {{plans for}} an {{underground}} <b>garage</b> at Union Square were given to Pflueger for political reasons. George Applegarth's 1935 design was actively opposed from several directions and Pflueger's social contacts and his friendship with mayor Angelo Joseph Rossi were {{needed to get the}} project started. Union Square <b>garage</b> opened in 1943 with Pflueger's touch making it a full-service valet <b>garage</b> complete with a waiting room and rest rooms for shoppers and the option of having shopping packages sent directly from a nearby store to the <b>garage</b> or for the car to be delivered to the store. The concept of an underground <b>garage</b> below a city park was influential: New York builder Robert Moses requested copies of Pflueger's plans (little changed from Applegarth's) and Pershing Square in Los Angeles was excavated and rebuilt in 1952 along the same lines.|$|E
5|$|Located at the Hatfield Government Center {{station is}} a parking <b>garage</b> for {{park-and-ride}} passengers. The <b>garage</b> includes 250 parking spaces accessible 24-hours a day.

5|$|The city of San Francisco {{notified}} the Mallochs {{that they were}} in violation of a building code prohibiting more than three floors above a <b>garage,</b> because the building contained four floors of apartments above the <b>garage.</b> The Mallochs successfully argued that their structure stepped back in progression up the slope of Telegraph Hill so that the top floor was not directly above the <b>garage.</b> No part of the building was in violation of the code.|$|E
50|$|An {{entirely new}} complex {{along the front}} stretch was built, housing modern pit stalls, <b>garages,</b> and the new {{observation}} suites built above the <b>garages.</b>|$|R
50|$|Two large three-level <b>garages</b> {{have been}} {{constructed}} {{directly in front of}} the passenger terminals, one on either side of the airport mosque. They are connected to the terminals and to the mosque by pedestrian walkways under the arrivals level roadway. The design capacity of the <b>garages</b> is 11,600 vehicles. The <b>garages</b> are built of cast-in-place concrete and each covered level is 4 m high. Escalators and elevators are available in these <b>garages,</b> as well as stairways between the different levels.|$|R
50|$|The route {{has been}} run {{from a number}} of <b>garages.</b> The {{computer}} scheduling system developed by London Buses in the 1970s is designed for a maximum of four <b>garages</b> operating on any one route; this was derived from route 12, which had four <b>garages</b> operating vehicles on it at the time. During the annual Notting Hill Carnival express services operated as 12X.|$|R
5|$|After {{the school}} closed in 1953, the larger, {{original}} room was {{converted into a}} bus <b>garage</b> by the Chana School District. A large <b>garage</b> door was cut into {{the building and the}} floor completely removed. The smaller, 1893 room became a storage area. In 1962, the Chana School District ran out of room and used the building as an overflow classroom. By the mid-1960s, the Chana District folded and was absorbed by the Oregon School District. Residents were allowed to remove any items from the school after the district shut down.|$|E

5|$|Despite this, many post-grunge bands {{adopted a}} hard rock sound {{and in the}} 2000s there came a renewed {{interest}} in established bands, attempts at a revival, and new hard rock bands that emerged from the <b>garage</b> rock and post-punk revival scenes. Out of this movement came <b>garage</b> rock bands like the White Stripes, the Strokes, Interpol and, later on, the Black Keys. In the 2000s, only a few hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers.|$|E
50|$|Bus <b>garages</b> will {{generally}} have large areas unobstructed by supporting columns {{as well as}} high roofs, especially for storage of double-decker buses. Recently in London, the transfer of routes from double-decker operation to articulated buses has caused problems at some <b>garages</b> that {{were found to be}} too small to accommodate all the replacement buses, requiring splitting of allocations, or the building of new <b>garages.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1996, {{after failing}} to get his Lake Calumet Airport and having {{received}} harsh criticism {{for the idea of}} turning the airport into an industrial park, Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley announced the Midway Airport Terminal Development Program, which was launched the following year. At the time, it was the largest public works project in the state. The Midway Airport parking <b>garage</b> opened in 1999, bringing covered parking to the airport for the first time. The <b>garage</b> is connected to the Midway terminal building for convenient access to ticket counters and baggage claim areas.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTraffic {{is one of}} {{the main}} sources of {{particulate}} matter (PM) inside urban areas. This paper provides a preliminary assessment of the potential to reduce outdoor PM concentrations by local removal inside semi-enclosed parking <b>garages.</b> The assessment is performed by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based on the 3 D steady RANS equations and an Eulerian advection-diffusion equation. First, an extensive CFD validation study is performed with gas dispersion wind-tunnel measurements. Next, the case study for Eindhoven city center is conducted on a high-resolution grid including 16 semi-enclosed <b>garages.</b> Traffic intensities on the streets and in the <b>garages</b> are converted to PM 10 source terms. The <b>garages</b> are ventilated with outdoor air. Simulations are performed with and without removal units in the <b>garages.</b> The case study is not intended to reproduce a particular pollution episode but to provide a preliminary indication of the potential reduction in PM 10 for representative meteorological and traffic conditions. The results show that 594 removal units allow reductions in local outdoor PM 10 by up to 50 % close to the <b>garages</b> while reductions up to 10 % are achieved further downstream. It is concluded that local removal in semi-enclosed parking <b>garages</b> can be an effective strategy towards improved outdoor air quality...|$|R
5000|$|... iPark is the [...] "largest, {{privately held}} owner-operated <b>garages</b> and parking lots" [...] {{in the state}} of New York, and Bill Lerner has been the {{overseer}} of such growth. In 2011 iPark installed the company’s first “Beam Charging” station in 14 of its <b>garages.</b> iPark also became known for owner Bill Lerner's initiative in the winter of 2014 that allowed iPark to send employees out to help “dig motorist parked within a five block radius of any of his 125 parking <b>garages</b> out of the snow for free.” iPark <b>garages</b> are also used as a “vehicle for exposure” for Bill Lerner and Alexson Roy’s non-profit organization Billy4Kids; boxes are available in 110 iPark <b>garages</b> in New York to encourage people to “donate new or worn shoes” for children living in poverty who are exposed to “foot-born diseases.” ...|$|R
