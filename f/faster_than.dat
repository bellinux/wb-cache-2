40|$|Background: The {{physiological}} uptake of 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in {{the heart}} often interferes with the accurate diagnosis of inflammatory cardiac diseases (CDs). Unfractionated heparin (UFH) administration may suppress its uptake through the alteration of myocardial metabolism. Purpose: To clarify the effectiveness of UFH administration to suppress the physiological FDG uptake {{in the heart}}. Material and Methods: The physiological FDG uptake in the heart was compared among 178 patients who <b>fasted</b> less <b>than</b> 18 h, 37 patients who <b>fasted</b> more <b>than</b> 18 h, and 64 patients who <b>fasted</b> more <b>than</b> 18 h and were administered UFH (UFH-CD group) prior to FDG PET/CT. Free fatty acid (FFA), triglyceride, insulin, and blood glucose levels were measured after UFH administration. Myocardial FDG uptake was evaluated by visual assessment and {{on the basis of}} maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax). Results: In the UFH-CD group, the FFA level increased 15 min after UFH administration (P < 0. 01). Blood glucose and insulin levels remained unchanged (P = NS). FDG physiological uptake was observed in 69 % of the patients who <b>fasted</b> less <b>than</b> 18 h, 38 % of the patients <b>fasted</b> more <b>than</b> 18 h, and 22 % of the UFH-CD group (P < 0. 01 for trend). SUVmax decreased in the UFH-CD group compared with the patients who <b>fasted</b> less <b>than</b> 18 h (P < 0. 01) and the patients who <b>fasted</b> more <b>than</b> 18 h (P = 0. 029). Conclusion: UFH administration and <b>fasting</b> more <b>than</b> 18 h could effectively suppress FDG physiological uptake in the heart and can be a useful method of detecting inflammatory CDs and tumors...|$|R

5|$|Haumea {{displays}} large {{fluctuations in}} brightness {{over a period}} of 3.9 hours, which can only be explained by a rotational period of this length. This is <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> any other known equilibrium body in the Solar System, and indeed <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> any other known body larger than 100 km in diameter. While most rotating bodies in equilibrium are flattened into oblate spheroids, Haumea rotates so quickly that it is distorted into a triaxial ellipsoid. If Haumea were to rotate much more rapidly, it would distort itself into a dumbbell shape and split in two. This rapid rotation is thought to have been caused by the impact that created its satellites and collisional family.|$|E

5|$|Limousins {{have become}} popular {{because of their}} low birth weights (ease of calving), higher than average {{dressing}} percentage (ratio of carcase to live weight) and yield (ratio of meat to carcase), high feed conversion efficiency, {{and their ability to}} produce lean, tender meat. A major multi-breed study reported that Limousins converted feed into saleable meat more efficiently and significantly <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> popular British breeds, and marginally <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> other popular continental European cattle breeds. Conversely, the other cattle breeds produced proportionally more low-cost by-product and waste, which resulted in their live weight growth being <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> Limousins. Limousins are especially favoured for crossbreeding with cattle such as Angus, Hereford and Shorthorn because of their ability to contribute hybrid vigour, and improve the yield and feed conversion efficiency of these British breeds, which produce higher levels of fat and marbled meat.|$|E
