50|$|After two brief {{stops in}} New York and Panama, Darío arrived in Nicaragua {{where he was}} given a warm welcome. Regardless of the tributes offered to him, he failed to obtain a divorce. In addition, he was not paid what was owed to him from his {{position}} as consul; this left him unable to return to Paris. After a few months he managed to be named resident minister in Madrid for the Nicaraguan government of José Santos Zelaya. He had economic problems since his limited budget barely allowed him to meet all of his delegation's expenses, and he had much economic difficulty while he was Nicaraguan ambassador. He managed to get by, partly with his salary from La Nación and partly {{with the help of his}} friend and director of the magazine Ateneo, Mariano Miguel de Val, who, while the economic situation was at its toughest, offered himself as secretary to the Nicaraguan delegation at no charge and offered his house, number 27 Serrano street, to serve as the <b>diplomatic</b> <b>quarters</b> of the Nicaraguan delegation. When Zelaya was overthrown, Darío was forced to resign his diplomatic post on February 25, 1909. He remained loyal to Zelaya, whom he had heavily praised in his book Viaje a Nicaragua e Intermezzo tropical, and with whom he had collaborated in the writing of Estados Unidos y la revolución de Nicaragua. In that work the United States and the Guatemalan dictator Manuel Estrada Cabrera were accused of planning the overthrow of the Zelaya government. During his time as ambassador, there was a rift between Darío and his former friend Alejandro Sawa, whose requests for economic assistance went unheard by Darío. The correspondence between them gives room to interpret that Sawa was the real author of several of the articles that Darío had published in La Nación.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{efforts to}} {{formulate}} strategies that will turn Qatar's capital city {{into a global}} hub {{have given rise to}} a debate about the morphological and functional composition of one of Doha's most prominent areas - West Bay. At the end of the 20 th century West Bay, also known as <b>Diplomatic</b> <b>Quarter,</b> was chosen by public initiatives to become the new Central Business District of Doha. Today, the appeal of West Bay as a business hub is contested by other emerging urban centres - such as the highly integrated Al Sadd area, which has attracted a wide range of advanced producer service sectors. It is therefore the objective of this paper to investigate the spatial configuration of Doha's West Bay, which arguably lays the foundations for the socio-economic interdependences necessary for its vitality and sustenance. In order to quantify its intrinsic urban complexities, Bill Hillier's space syntax methodology is applied, which elucidates, in various scales, global and local grid conditions, and thus can be used for assessments regarding the distribution of land use patterns and infrastructural networks...|$|R

25|$|At 06:00 on 30 April the 150th Rifle Division {{had still}} not {{captured}} {{the upper floors}} of the Ministry of the Interior, but while the fighting was still going on, the 150th launched an attack from there across the 400 metres of Königsplatz towards the Reichstag. For the Soviets, the Reichstag was {{the symbol of the}} Third Reich (ironically, it was never restored by the Nazis after the fire); but it was of such significant value that the Soviets wanted to capture it before the May Day parade in Moscow. The assault was not an easy one. The Germans had dug a complicated network of trenches around the building and a collapsed tunnel had filled with water from the Spree forming a moat across Königsplatz. The initial infantry assault was decimated by cross fire from the Reichstag and the Kroll Opera House on the western side of Königsplatz. By now the Spree had been bridged and the Soviets were able to bring up tanks and artillery to support fresh assaults by the infantry, some of which were tasked with out-flanking the Opera House and attacking it from the north-west. By 10:00 the soldiers of the 150th had reached the moat, but accurate fire from 12.8cm guns, two kilometres away on the Berlin Zoo flak tower, prevented any further successful advance across the moat during daylight. Throughout the rest of the day, as ninety artillery pieces, some as large as the 203mm howitzer, as well as Katyusha rocket launchers, bombarded the Reichstag and its defensive trenches. Colonel Negoda's 171st Rifle Division, on the left flank of the 150th, continued to capture the buildings of the <b>diplomatic</b> <b>quarter</b> to the north of Königsplatz.|$|R
5000|$|In her {{sixth year}} in Taiwan she was badly {{injured in a}} {{motorcycle}} accident and was profoundly touched by an immense outpouring of love, affection, support and care from the community. Welbon's friends not only rallied around her for emotional support, but raised funds {{to pay for her}} care and rehabilitation. In an odd twist it later emerged, as a very small footnote to a congressional review of CIA operations against Taiwan's nuclear weapons program, much of Welbon's medical care had been anonymously financed by an undercover male Caucasian intelligence operative active in the still largely classified program. A wrinkle in this link is the fact Welbon's motorcycle accident took place on a remote off-shore island where Taiwan's nuclear waste was stored; if indeed the CIA had been collecting isotopic evidence of the ROC's nuclear ambitions, they would have been doing it in the precise highly isolated location where Welbon's motorcycle accident occurred. A number of signal intercepts by the Taiwan counter-intelligence services relating to Welbon's relationship with the Caucasian male intelligence officer in question strongly suggested the two harbored romantic feelings for one another. During her residence in Taiwan an epic birthday party was staged in her honor in the <b>diplomatic</b> <b>quarter</b> of Taipei at the rented home of an individual widely thought to have extensive connections to MI6 and who had a career encompassing activities in Indonesia, China, Taiwan and North Korea. Somewhat humorously Welbon's connections to those involved in intelligence activities inspired a Master's dissertation by a Chinese student at Taipei's Fu Hsing Kang College ( [...] 政治作戰學校, the famed and feared ROC college of Political Warfare [...] ) in 1999 examining Welbon's [...] "Bang !" [...] magazine as a classic case study of the establishment of a foreign-funded magazine to clandestinely shape indigenous public opinion.|$|R

40|$|This {{practical}} thesis aims {{to reform}} the use of plant material in landscape architecture projects in the Najd or Central Region of Saudi Arabia. Many aspects of landscape architecture in Najd attempt to emulate western concepts. Neglect or unawareness {{of the values of}} Arabic society {{is one of the main}} reasons for the failure of the landscape programme. This factor of traditional culture is particularly sensitive in Najd which is the birthplace of Whabism, one of the strictest applications of Islam. This implies special conditions that made outdoor design sensitive and complicated, unable to tolerate western forms. Western urban patterns in planning, such as wide streets, neighbourhood parks and their detailed components of artifacts and plant materials, all shattered the character of traditional landscape architecture in the region. Although indigenous landscape elements in Najd evolved as a result of socio-environmental factors, many consultants do not differentiate between Persian, Islamic, and Najdi gardens. The inventory of available plant species indicates that most are imported from tropical and subtropical countries. These species require stripping of soil from wadi Hanifah for potting, and for top soiling planting projects, a process destructive to the rich wadi habitat. Such a process is necessary when using imported plant material while native ones can adapt to the existing sandy and saline soil. The devastation of the wadi ecosystem, the saline water table and the high cost of maintaining those plants, represents serious short and long term economic, ecological and technical implications. These implications all point to the scale of these negative consequences of using imported plant material. Also, climatic data, points to the suitability and adaptability of native flora and its significance in avoiding further damage to eco-environment. Use of imported plants in arid Najd and creating a man-made micro climate to suit them, is a waste of resources, especially the water budget in Saudi Arabia. The thesis proves that these plants consume large amounts of water, require high levels of maintenance, are unsuitable to Najdi environment, introduce new pests and diseases, require special microclimatic conditions, rich soil and prove unsuccessful in their functions. All the previous factors combine to acknowledge the failure of many tropical gardens in the arid land of Najd. The answer lies in Najd itself which is wealthy in flora adapted to its local conditions. The potential for their use in Saudi Arabian landscape projects is vast. Individually they will substitute for the imported nursury stock, while the available communities represent a ready-made and complete landscape element which would be valuable for Najdi parks. The general question, the comparative advantages of native over imported plants is conclusively answered in the thesis. Though the native plants are diverse, attractive and available, they were tested practically aiming at, firstly to test the individual species, the "target species method", and secondly to test the whole community "target community method". Three test sites were allocated in the <b>Diplomatic</b> <b>Quarter</b> to test the selected target species and communities. The tests were conducted extensively over five years and intensively over three years, during which the author monitored closely a large number of species and communities and arrived at an encouraging set of results and findings. The conclusion of the thesis consists of two parts. Firstly, the successful species which is included in a Flora, and the successful target communities which use selected target communities as a landscape design tool. These are aimed specifically at landscape designers. Secondly, the author recommends how to utilize both methods in a typical Najdi urban park, and how to encourage their successful use...|$|R
