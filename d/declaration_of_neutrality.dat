5|$|The French were infuriated at King Leopold III's open <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>neutrality</b> in October 1936. The French Army saw its {{strategic}} assumptions undermined; it {{could no longer}} expect closer cooperation with the Belgians in defending the latter's eastern borders, enabling a German attack to be checked well forward of the French border. The French were dependent on how much cooperation they could extract from the Belgians. Such a situation deprived the French any prepared defences in Belgium to forestall an attack, a situation which the French had wanted to avoid as it meant engaging the German Panzer Divisions in a mobile battle. The French considered invading Belgium immediately {{in response to a}} German attack on the country. The Belgians, recognising the danger posed by the Germans, secretly made their own defence policies, troop movement information, communications, fixed defence dispositions, intelligence and air reconnaissance arrangements available to the French military attaché in Brussels.|$|E

Initially, the inhabitants of Acadia were uninvolved in the conflict because the French had already ceded the land to Britain under the Treaty of Utrecht (1713). The Acadians were asked to take an oath declaring complete fidelity toward the British monarch on several occasions, but they refused. At first, they were not punished for doing so. A <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>neutrality</b> was signed in 1730 and was accepted by Nova Scotia governor Richard Philipps. This earned the Acadians the nickname the [...] "neutral French". At the outbreak of war in 1754, the British again demanded unconditional oaths of fealty, perceiving the Acadians as a possible threat. In spite of resistance led by Jean-Louis Le Loutre, representatives eventually agreed to sign, but their reluctance persuaded Governor Charles Lawrence to order the Acadian population expelled from British territory.|$|E

For Russia, the political situation in the United States is of crucial political importance, as in the perception of the Kremlin, the US is Russia’s strategic adversary. Despite their official <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> <b>neutrality,</b> the Russian authorities clearly favoured Trump’s candidacy during the elections. This was linked to Moscow’s hopes for the following events: deepening tensions in trans-Atlantic relations, and with the United States’ other allies (including weakening of NATO); a partial review of US policy in the security sphere (including drawing down US military engagement in Europe, including on NATO’s eastern flank); and in particular a possible strategic deal with Russia (based on the transactional approach seen in Trump’s policy statements, and his perceived ‘pragmatism’ in relation to Russia). In recent months the Russian government has taken a series of active measures (aggressive actions and military demonstrations, cyber-attacks, leaks and media campaigns) whose objectives included compromising or weakening the camp or the candidacy of Hillary Clinton. In recent weeks, this was helped by Russia’s artificial aggravation of the crisis in relations with the United States. At the same time, Moscow has demonstrated its potential to cause harm, and is now attempting to force a new US administration to enter a strategic bargain with it...|$|R

[...] Confederate ships could obtain fuel, supplies and repairs in neutral ports but could not secure military equipment or arms. The availability of Britain's far-flung colonial ports made it possible for Confederate ships to pursue Union shipping throughout much of the world.

Belligerency also gave the Confederate government the opportunity to purchase supplies, contract with British companies, and purchase a navy to search out and seize Union ships. The Queen's proclamation made clear that Britons were prohibited from joining the military of either side, equipping any ships for military use in the war, breaking any proper blockade, and from transporting military goods, documents, or personnel to either side.|$|E

With that project in his mind he stood motionless--his hands in his belt, his eyes fixed absently on the ground. Nello, glancing at him, felt sure that he was absorbed in anxiety about Romola, and thought him such a pretty image of self-forgetful sadness, that he just perceptibly pointed his razor at him, and gave a challenging look at Piero di Cosimo, whom he had never forgiven for his refusal to see any prognostics of character in his favourite's handsome face.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Mongolians have debated a potential <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> permanent <b>neutrality</b> since September 2015. These debates have contained {{little or no}} consideration of the potential effects on Mongolia's defense cooperation with foreign military. Mongolia has developed defense cooperation with Russia, China, and other countries {{in order to enhance}} military capability and interoperability. The country's defense cooperation allows Mongolia's contribution to global peace and stability activities as a vital foreign policy tool of the country. This thesis analyzes the potential effects <b>of</b> permanent <b>neutrality</b> on foreign defense cooperation. This analysis is based on the study of the concept <b>of</b> <b>neutrality</b> and the benefits and limitations <b>of</b> the permanent <b>neutrality</b> policies; the examination of the defense cooperation experiences of neutral countries such as Switzerland, Finland, Sweden, Austria, and Turkmenistan; and the evaluation of current foreign cooperation of Mongolia's defense. If Mongolia became permanently neutral, it would likely cause defense cooperation challenges, such as discouraging current partners, and potential disengagement of current cooperation. Since Mongolia has limited military capacity, foreign cooperation for defense is crucial. Such cooperation will enhance Mongolia's defense capacity and enable it to participate in global stability affairs. This thesis assesses that the permanent neutrality policy is not suitable for Mongolia's defense foreign cooperation. Lieutenant Colonel, Mongolian Armed Force...|$|R
