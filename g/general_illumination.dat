Because of this, {{the lifetime}} of a filament lamp is a trade-off between efficiency and longevity. The trade-off is typically set to provide a lifetime of several hundred to 2,000 hours for lamps used for <b>general</b> <b>illumination.</b> Theatrical, photographic, and projection lamps may have a useful life {{of only a few}} hours, trading life expectancy for high output in a compact form.

Other efforts had been mounted, but all were plagued by low efficiency and various technical problems. Of particular importance was the invention in 1927 of a low-voltage “metal vapor lamp” by Friedrich Meyer, Hans-Joachim Spanner, and Edmund Germer, who were employees of a German firm in Berlin. A German patent was granted but the lamp never went into commercial production.|$|E

We propose {{to solve this}} difficult problem by a simple yet effective approach that makes use of a coarse shape prior. The shape prior is obtained from multi-view stereo and will be useful in twofold: resolving the shape-light ambiguity in uncalibrated photometric stereo and guiding the estimated normals to produce the high quality 3 D surface. By assuming the surface albedo is not highly contrasted, we also propose a novel linear approximation of the nonlinear camera responses with our normal estimation algorithm. We evaluate our method using synthetic data and demonstrate the surface improvement on real data over multi-view stereo results.

2500|$|The {{next step}} in gas-based {{lighting}} {{took advantage of the}} luminescent qualities of neon, an inert gas that had been discovered in 1898 by isolation from the atmosphere. Neon glowed a brilliant red when used in Geissler tubes. By 1910, Georges Claude, a Frenchman who had developed a technology and a successful business for air liquefaction, was obtaining enough neon as a byproduct to support a neon lighting industry. While neon lighting was used around 1930 in France for <b>general</b> <b>illumination,</b> it was no more energy-efficient than conventional incandescent lighting. Neon tube lighting, which also includes the use of argon and mercury vapor as alternate gases, came to be used primarily for eye-catching signs and advertisements. Neon lighting was relevant to the development of fluorescent lighting, however, as Claude’s improved electrode (patented in 1915) overcame [...] "sputtering", a major source of electrode degradation. Sputtering occurred when ionized particles struck an electrode and tore off bits of metal. Although Claude’s invention required electrodes with a lot of surface area, it showed that a major impediment to gas-based lighting could be overcome.|$|E

30|$|In recent years, {{along with}} the energy {{shortage}} and global warming, the development of energy saving products in the lighting field, such as white light-emitting diode (WLED), has attracted great attention [1]. Due to the potential applications in indicators, green architectural lighting, automobile headlights, backlights, and <b>general</b> <b>illuminations,</b> WLEDs have {{become a kind of}} daily lighting source with excellent properties such as high efficiency, good light stability, long operational lifetime, and environmentally friendly characteristics [2 – 5]. Furthermore, many efforts {{have been made in the}} search of down-converting phosphors converting ultraviolet (UV) or blue light into a combination of red-green-blue light in order to obtain white light emission [6]. Commercial WLEDs lamp is commonly fabricated by using a blue InGaN LED chip and the yellow-emitting Y 3 Al 5 O 12 :Ce 3 + (YAG:Ce) phosphor. However, such WLEDs have a poor color rendering index (CRI) and a high correlated color temperature (CCT) [7, 8] because of lacking a red component. However, WLEDs can be also fabricated by pumping blue, green and red phosphors coated on a near-UV (n-UV) LED chip which has a high CRI [9]. For this reason, it is necessary to develop novel multi-color emission phosphors in the field of optical materials.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Various {{problems}} in Computer Vision become difficult {{due to a}} strong influence of lighting on the images of an object. Recent work showed analytically that the set of all images of a convex, Lambertian object can be accurately approximated by the low-dimensional linear subspace constructed using spherical harmonic functions. In this paper we present two major contributions: first, we extend previous analysis of spherical harmonic approximation {{to the case of}} arbitrary objects; second, we analyze its applicability for near light. We begin by showing that under distant lighting, with uniform distribution of light sources, the average accuracy of spherical harmonic representation can be bound from below. This bound holds for objects of arbitrary geometry and color, and for <b>general</b> <b>illuminations</b> (consisting of any number of light sources). We further examine the case when light is coming from above and provide an analytic expression for the accuracy obtained in this case. Finally, we show that low-dimensional representations using spherical harmonics provide an accurate approximation also for fairly near light. Our analysis assumes Lambertian reflectance and accounts for attached, but not for cast shadows. We support this analysis by simulations and real experiments, including an example of a 3 D shape reconstruction by photometric stereo under very close, unknown lighting. ...|$|R
