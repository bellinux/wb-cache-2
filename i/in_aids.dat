5|$|Although {{societal}} {{awareness of}} AIDS had developed {{at a slower}} pace in Canada than in the United States, films regarding the disease had appeared nearly concurrently: both the first Canadian documentary and the first American feature-length film on the subject, Nik Sheehan's No Sad Songs and John Erman's An Early Frost respectively, were released in 1985. However, the majority of the early gay artists with AIDS had died by the time Hoolboom made Frank's Cock; as such, the film scholar Thomas Waugh considers Hoolboom a second-generation figurehead <b>in</b> <b>AIDS</b> activism and one of the earliest not coming from the gay community.|$|E
5|$|Chagas {{named the}} {{pathogenic}} parasite as Trypanosoma cruzi and {{later that year}} as Schizotrypanum cruzi, both honoring Oswaldo Cruz, the noted Brazilian physician and epidemiologist who successfully fought epidemics of yellow fever, smallpox, and bubonic plague in Rio de Janeiro and other cities {{in the beginning of}} the 20th century. Chagas was also the first to unknowingly discover and illustrate the parasitic fungal genus Pneumocystis, later infamously linked to PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia <b>in</b> <b>AIDS</b> victims). Confusion between the two pathogens' life-cycles led him to briefly recognize his genus Schizotrypanum, but following the description of Pneumocystis by others as an independent genus, Chagas returned to the use of the name Trypanosoma cruzi.|$|E

5|$|On {{his return}} to England, Baden-Powell noticed that boys showed {{considerable}} interest <b>in</b> <b>Aids</b> to Scouting, which was unexpectedly used by teachers and youth organizations as their first Scouting handbook. He was urged to rewrite this book for boys, especially during an inspection of the Boys' Brigade, a large youth movement drilled with military precision. Baden-Powell thought {{this would not be}} attractive and suggested that the Boys' Brigade could grow much larger were Scouting to be used. He studied other schemes, parts of which he used for Scouting.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time gay men were getting sick in the U.S., doctors in Paris, France, were {{receiving}} patients who were African or {{who had lived in}} Africa with the same symptoms as Americans. Parisian researchers Jean-Claude Chermann, Françoise Barre, Luc Montagnier, and doctor Willy Rozenbaum began taking biopsies of HIV-infected lymph nodes and discovered a new retrovirus. As a scientific necessity to compare it to the American version of HIV, French doctors representing the Pasteur Institute sent a colleague to the National Cancer Institute, where Robert Gallo was also working on the virus. The colleague switched the samples, Shilts reported, because of a grudge he had against the Pasteur Institute. Instead of Gallo comparing his samples with the French samples, he found the very same retrovirus as the French sample, putting back any new results <b>in</b> <b>AIDS</b> research for at least a year.|$|E
5|$|Mattea {{is known}} for her roles <b>in</b> <b>AIDS</b> activism. In 1992, many {{televised}} awards shows were handing out red ribbons to participants in honor of AIDS awareness, but the Country Music Association chose to hand out green ribbons promoting environmental awareness instead. Mattea chose to wear three red ribbons that night, each one honoring {{a friend of hers}} who had died of the disease, along with the green ribbon. A 1994 article in the Chicago Tribune noted that a Nashville newspaper interprted a comment she had made on wearing both color ribbons as a confrontation, and that Mattea was often questioned as to whether her activism had a negative impact on sales of her then-current album. Besides her participation in the Red Hot + Country charity album series, Mattea also participated in charity concerts and made public appearances at activism campaigns. She was also the recipient of the inaugural Harvard AIDS Initiative award in 1994.|$|E

25|$|Duesberg {{argues that}} there is a {{statistical}} correlation between trends in recreational drug use and trends <b>in</b> <b>AIDS</b> cases.

25|$|In a 2009 editorial, {{the journal}} accused Pope Benedict XVI of {{publicly}} distorting scientific evidence on condoms to promote Catholic doctrine on chastity <b>in</b> <b>AIDS</b> prevention.

However, it recognized that wide-scale educational campaigns focused on altering individual behavior played a critical role.|$|E
25|$|Health {{officials}} say {{there are plenty of}} problems in China's approach to AIDS. There are frequent reports of police crack-downs on local NGOs involved <b>in</b> <b>AIDS</b> prevention. There have also been reports of police using the presence of a condom in a sex worker's handbag to justify detention. This has been partially blamed on policy incoordination, and contradictions and conflicts between laws and regulations.|$|E
25|$|In {{cases of}} anergy, {{a lack of}} {{reaction}} by the body's defence mechanisms when it comes into contact with foreign substances, the tuberculin reaction will occur weakly, thus compromising the value of Mantoux testing. For example, anergy is present <b>in</b> <b>AIDS,</b> a disease which strongly depresses the immune system. Therefore, anergy testing is advised in cases where there is suspicion that anergy is present. However, routine anergy skin testing is not recommended.|$|E
