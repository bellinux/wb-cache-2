50|$|Usufruct {{has been}} revived {{as part of}} the {{agricultural}} change associated with Cuba's Special Period. As a legacy of sanctions and a struggling economy, Cuba had accumulated many crumbling buildings that could not be repaired. These were torn down and the empty lots lay idle for years until the food shortages forced Cuban citizens to make use of every piece of land. Initially, this was an ad-hoc process where ordinary Cubans took the initiative to grow their own food in whatever piece of land was available. Tenure but not ownership was formalised with a legal framework using usufruct to give <b>farmers</b> <b>rights</b> on a profit-sharing basis to the products produced from the land, but not ownership rights to the land itself.|$|E
50|$|Right to {{farm laws}} vary across the nation. They are {{intended}} to bolster the legitimacy of agricultural concerns, defend <b>farmers</b> <b>rights</b> without undue outside interference, and minimize or resolve public and private land use conflicts. In a broader sense the notion originally referred to relief {{from all kinds of}} undue interference, usually involving legal interpretations focused on nuisance issues such as noise, odors, environmental, visual, farm technology, etc. This is partly because it is a modification of the common law doctrine of nuisance. Common law nuisances are seen as private or public nuisances. A public nuisance impairs the health, safety, morals, and comfort of the general community without necessarily harming particular property rights in any kind way. A private nuisance unreasonably interferes with the use and enjoyment of another's land.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} Protection of Plant Varieties and <b>Farmers</b> <b>Rights</b> Act 2001 {{along with the}} proposed Seed Bill fulfills Indias obligations under Article 27. 3 of TRIPS. Further, the paper analyzes the benefits India is likely to derive from fulfilling these obligations. Thus, Part I examines Article 27. 3 of TRIPS to analyze the constituents of the effectiveness requirement of the article. In analyzing whether the sui generis system in UPOV is effective, Part II details that UPOVs effectiveness is questionable considering that it has diluted eligibility standards, exaggerated scope of breeders rights, and limited exceptions to breeders rights. Part III, examines the effectiveness of PPVFA and the proposed Seeds Bill. This part concludes that India should refrain from enacting the Seeds Bill but should, instead, strengthen the PPVFA by plugging existing loopholes to achieve national objectives. The conclusion highlights PBRs per se can potentially lead to increased research in agriculture despite the resulting privatization/monopolization.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{research}} and review articles published on sweet sorghum. However, no single publication gives {{a detailed account}} of the morpho-biochemical traits of improved tropical sweet sorghum cultivars. This chapter gives detailed account of the materials used, methods followed for data collection and analysis to characterise sweet sorghum genotypes following the guidelines of Protection of Plant Varieties and <b>Farmers</b> <b>Rights</b> Act, 2001 (PPVFRA). The pooled analysis of variance for quantitative traits revealed that these cultivars had significant differences between them for the expression of all the quantitative characters under study for both the seasons. The results revealed that the productivity levels of tropical sweet sorghums during post-rainy season (October–March) are generally low due to photo-sensitivity and thermo-sensitivity of the genotypes vis-a-vis that of rainy season (June–October) and necessitates identifying new sources/alleles contributing to both biomass and sugar yiel...|$|E
