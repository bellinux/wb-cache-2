40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of any inpatient opioid detoxification programme when compared with all other time-limited detoxification programmes on the level of completion of detoxification, the intensity <b>and</b> <b>duration</b> of <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms, the nature and incidence of adverse effects, the level of engagement in further treatment post-detoxification, and the rates of relapse post-detoxification...|$|R
30|$|A {{set of four}} wells were {{assumed as}} injection/withdrawal wells. These are drilled within the {{reservoir}} top and enjoy minimum leakage probability. During injection <b>and</b> <b>withdrawal</b> operations, other wells are kept stopped and serve as observation wells. In the beginning, target production rate is set based on per well withdrawal objective for peak season (2 MMSM 3 /D). Based on the determined <b>duration</b> of injection <b>and</b> <b>withdrawal</b> operations, injection rate per well is 750 MSM 3 /D. Among other scenarios for natural depletion phase of the reservoir, scenario five was selected {{to begin with the}} alternating process of gas storage <b>and</b> <b>withdrawal.</b> This scenario was associated with the best results regarding maximum cumulative gas and condensate production and minimum pressure drop. Furthermore, different abandonment reservoir pressures were tested to find the optimum one, to determine the optimum base gas capacity.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} Eurycoma longifolia (E.  longifolia) standardized extract on the oestrous cycle, levels of reproductive hormones and histology of the ovaries of Sprague-Dawley rats. Methods: Female rats were orally treated with E.  longifolia standardized extract at the dose levels of 2. 5, 5. 0, 10. 0, 25. 0, 50. 0 and 100. 0  mg/kg of body weight over 5 days. Vaginal smears were monitored daily within the <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> after <b>withdrawal</b> of the treatment before being sacrificed. The body weights of the females were recorded {{before and after the}} 5 days treatment. At the end of the experiments, blood samples were collected for determination of testosterone, oestradiol and progesterone levels. Ovaries were removed, weighed and examined for histomorphological changes. Results: The administration of E.  longifolia standardized extract did not significantly alter the oestrous cycle of the rats during the 5 days treatment <b>and</b> after <b>withdrawal</b> of the treatments. This was supported by normal testosterone, oestradiol and progesterone levels as well as normal morphology of the ovaries. Conclusions: The data obtained showed that E.  longifolia standardized extract did not exhibit any toxic effect on reproductive activities of female rats suggesting potential use in the management of infertility...|$|R
40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{effectiveness}} of methadone detoxification with traditional method of gradual decrement in the abused amount of the refined opium dross (Shireh) to control withdrawal syndrome in Shireh-addicted patients. Methods: In this study, two groups of Shireh addicts were compared. The first group was treated by methadone and the second group by gradual decrement in the amount of consumed Shireh. Those experiencing the adverse effects of the treatment were excluded from the study. Methadone dose was calculated based on the amount of the Shireh consumed and detoxification was performed during a 21 -day period. In the second group, the amount of the consumed Shireh was gradually decreased within 21 days and some of the withdrawal symptoms were selected as indicators for patient evaluation. Results: A total of 35 patients (16 versus 19 patients in the first and second groups) were evaluated. Their mean age was 43 ± 4 years and all were male. A statistically significant difference was found between these two groups in terms of severity <b>and</b> <b>duration</b> of <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms within the first five days <b>and</b> their <b>duration</b> after the 21 st day of the onset of detoxification (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: In comparison with methadone detoxification, traditional method of gradually decreasing the consumed amount of Shireh controls the severity <b>and</b> <b>duration</b> of <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms better in the course of detoxification. ...|$|R
40|$|Inaugural lecture {{delivered}} on 16 April 2013 This paper explores two themes {{related to the}} financial aspects of retirement – real-age adjusted life expectancy and the financial survival probability of living annuitants. The first theme focuses {{on the development of}} a model to determine an individual’s adjusted life expectancy based on his or her real age as opposed to his or her calendar age. The model incorporates aspects such as gender, residing province, income, HIV status, ethnic background, weight, exercise, family illness history, stress, substance abuse and diet. The finding was that the real-age adjusted life expectancy of individuals retiring at age 65 may be as much as twice the life expectancy based on the latest South African actuarial mortality tables. This has significant implications for retirement planning. The second theme focuses on the financial survival probability of pensioners who have selected living annuities as their preferred retirement investment option. It addresses the question of how long a given amount of capital will be able to fund a living annuitant if the following parameters are known: expected retirement duration (i. e. years between retirement date and expected date of death), investment returns, inflation, annual <b>withdrawal</b> amount <b>and</b> initial capital amount. A model was developed that shows how retirement <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> different <b>withdrawal</b> rates change the probability of having sufficient capital in retirement for different investment scenarios...|$|R

This paper first described the current state of the deposit <b>and</b> <b>withdrawal</b> services in Taiwan to individuals with mental retardation. The person with mental retardation often tried hard to adapt himself/herself to the existing deposit <b>and</b> <b>withdrawal</b> slips. This paper addressed the difficulties faced by users with mental retardation in comprehending the contents of the deposit <b>and</b> <b>withdrawal</b> slips. The investigation into the low usability showed no consideration for meeting the demand of users with mental retardation.

40|$|High relapse {{rates among}} smokers {{attempting}} to quit {{have been linked}} with failure to cope with cigarette cravings <b>and</b> <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms. Smoking cravings <b>and</b> <b>withdrawal</b> behavior {{is known to be}} influenced by stress and exposure to smoking cues. Exercise appears to reduce cigarette cravings <b>and</b> <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms. However no study has investigated the effects of exercise on cue-elicited cravings <b>and</b> <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms, or on ad libitum smoking behavior. Aim: Four experimental studies were designed {{to examine the effects of}} exercise on smoking behavior. Initial studies focused on the effects of a single session of brisk walk on cigarette cravings <b>and</b> <b>withdrawal</b> symptom. Further research examined the effects ofthe walk on <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms <b>and</b> cravings and response to smoking cues and time spent on ad libitum smoking. Methods: All studies examined the effects of a short bout of brisk walking (15 - 20 minutes) versus a passive control condition. For the purposes of the experiments, participants were temporarily smoking abstinent or non-abstinent. Multiple and single item measures of cravings <b>and</b> <b>withdrawal,</b> as well as different experimental designs were used in order to enhance the reliability of the findings...|$|R

In Studies 2, 3, and 4 after the exercise (or the control) participants were exposed to smoking cues. In these studies after the laboratory session, ad libitum smoking was determined from the subject's cell phone text message. Results: Cigarette cravings, <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms <b>and</b> negative affect decreased rapidly during exercise and remained reduced for 20 - 50 minutes after exercise. This pattern was robust across the four studies, across different abstinent periods, across single and multiple measures of cravings <b>and</b> <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms, across experimental designs and across samples. Furthermore, it was shown that exercise attenuated increases in cue elicited cravings <b>and</b> <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms. Results also indicated a two- to threefold longer time to the next cigarette following exercise. Exercise produced these effects by mimicking the relaxing effects of smoking. Conclusions: Short bouts of brisk walk are recommended as an aid to managing cigarette cravings <b>and</b> <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{characterize}} antagonist-precipitated heroin <b>withdrawal</b> during <b>and</b> immediately following anaesthesia and to identify the determinants of <b>withdrawal</b> severity <b>and</b> <b>duration</b> in 48 dependent heroin users. Objective withdrawal signs decreased significantly with each naloxone bolus administered under anaesthetic. The cost (amount) of the final heroin administration {{and the number of}} hours between last heroin use and commencement of anaesthesia were significant, independent predictors of the severity of withdrawal symptomatology. While 83 % (40 / 48) of participants completed withdrawal according to objective criteria and commenced maintenance naltrexone treatment, almost half (22 / 48) were unable to commence naltrexone {{on the day of the}} procedure due to residual withdrawal signs. Fourteen of these 22 participants subsequently commenced naltrexone (median number of days between admission and commencement of naltrexone was 2, range 1 – 6) while eight left treatment prior to initiation of naltrexone. Significantly fewer of those with more severe withdrawal signs during anaesthesia commenced naltrexone (40 % vs. 60 %). While the severity <b>and</b> <b>duration</b> of <b>withdrawal</b> symptomatology may be moderated by encouraging participants to reduce (or cease) heroin use close to the time of withdrawal, for a substantial proportion of participants in this study, heroin withdrawal by this antagonist-precipitated procedure was neither rapid nor painless.
