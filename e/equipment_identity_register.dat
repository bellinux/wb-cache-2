50|$|When mobile {{equipment}} is stolen or lost, the owner can contact their local operator with a request {{that it should}} be blocked from the operator's network, and the operator can be expected to do so if required by law in the operator's jurisdiction. If the local operator possesses an <b>Equipment</b> <b>Identity</b> <b>Register</b> (EIR), it then may put the device IMEI into it, and can optionally communicate this to shared registries, such as the Central <b>Equipment</b> <b>Identity</b> <b>Register</b> (CEIR) which blacklists the device in switches of other operators that use the CEIR. With this blacklisting in place the device becomes unusable on any operator that uses the CEIR, making theft of {{mobile equipment}} a useless business proposition, unless for parts.|$|E
50|$|A Central <b>Equipment</b> <b>Identity</b> <b>Register</b> is a {{database}} of the IMEI numbers of blacklisted handsets. If a device's ESN or IMEI number is listed on a CEIR, it {{is not supposed to}} work on member service providers' networks; only paying members may access the database.|$|E

50|$|Every GSM phone {{contains}} a unique identifier (different {{from the phone}} number), called the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI). This can be found by dialing *#06#. When a phone contacts the network, its IMEI may be checked against the <b>Equipment</b> <b>Identity</b> <b>Register</b> to locate stolen phones and facilitate monitoring.|$|E
50|$|Currently, the Central <b>Equipment</b> <b>Identity</b> <b>Register</b> is more {{frequently}} called an IMEI DB (database) system {{which means that}} it is a central system for network operators (those that have an EIR) to share their individual blacklists with one another so that service is denied for the particular devices that appear on that blacklist. The idea is for network operators to compile one global blacklist through the IMEI DB. However, there is no agreement on a single CEIR.|$|E
50|$|The Mobile Application Part (MAP) is an SS7 {{protocol}} {{that provides}} an application layer {{for the various}} nodes in GSM and UMTS mobile core networks and GPRS core networks {{to communicate with each}} other in order to provide services to users. The Mobile Application Part is the application-layer protocol used to access the Home Location Register, Visitor Location Register, Mobile Switching Center, <b>Equipment</b> <b>Identity</b> <b>Register,</b> Authentication Centre, Short message service center and Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN).|$|E

50|$|Identity {{cards were}} {{introduced}} under the Labour government under Tony Blair in 2006. The Identity Documents Act 2010 repealed the Identity Cards Act of 2006, scrapping the mandatory ID card scheme and associated National <b>Identity</b> <b>Register</b> {{that had been}} in use on a limited or voluntary basis since November 2008, but which was never fully implemented. The National <b>Identity</b> <b>Register</b> was destroyed on 10 February 2011.|$|R
5000|$|Individual GSM, WCDMA, iDEN {{and some}} {{satellite}} phone devices are uniquely identified by an International Mobile <b>Equipment</b> <b>Identity</b> (IMEI) number.|$|R
50|$|An <b>equipment</b> <b>identity</b> <b>register</b> {{reduces the}} threats of theft of mobile devices by {{enabling}} individual operators to prevent the use of stolen mobile devices on their own networks. This improves users' security by switching off stolen mobile devices, making them useless (bricked) for mobile devices thieves and thus {{less likely to be}} stolen in the first place. As the number of mobile devices and messaging users continue to grow, they become a target for fraudulent and criminal activities. Mobile Messaging application and infrastructure companies such as Mavenir, Primal Technologies, Svyazcom and Tekelec are examples of providers for Equipment Identity for worldwide mobile operators like Vodafone (Airwide), MTS (Svyazcom), 4GTSS and Cegetel (Tekelec) that deploy the lists for the CEIRs.|$|E
50|$|The <b>equipment</b> <b>identity</b> <b>register</b> {{is often}} {{integrated}} to the HLR. The EIR keeps {{a list of}} mobile phones (identified by their IMEI) which are to be banned from the network or monitored. This is designed to allow tracking of stolen mobile phones. In theory all data about all stolen mobile phones should be distributed to all EIRs in the world through a Central EIR. It is clear, however, {{that there are some}} countries where this is not in operation. The EIR data does not have to change in real time, which means that this function can be less distributed than the function of the HLR. The EIR is a database that contains information about the identity of the mobile equipment that prevents calls from stolen, unauthorized or defective mobile stations. Some EIR also have the capability to log Handset attempts and store it in a log file.|$|E

In GPRS networks, MAP protocol supports signaling exchanges with Home Location Register (HLR) and <b>Equipment</b> <b>Identity</b> <b>Register</b> (EIR). We begin with a brief introduction to SS 7 protocol stack and GPRS architecture. We then describe MAP features related to GPRS and modifications that we implemented in the GPRS OPNET model to provide signaling capabilities for communication between HLR and the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN). We provide implementation details and evaluate the impact of the MAP protocol overhead on network response time...|$|E

5000|$|National Identity Register: On 21 December 2010 the Identity Documents Act 2010 {{received}} Royal Assent.

Foreign nationals from outside the European Union, however, continue to require an ID card for use as a biometric residence permit under the provisions of the UK Borders Act 2007 and the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009. The National <b>Identity</b> <b>Register</b> was officially destroyed on 10 February 2011 when the final 500 hard drives containing the register were shredded.|$|R
