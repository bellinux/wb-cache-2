5|$|With the Mirage2000 and F-18L rejected, the RAAF {{was faced}} with a choice between the F-16 and F-18A. Richardson and several other RAAF pilots tested United States Air Force (USAF) F-16Bs in 1979 and 1980, and {{reported}} that the aircraft had excellent performance but could be difficult to control at times. The <b>evaluation</b> <b>team</b> was also concerned about the reliability of the F-16's engine and regarded the aircraft as technologically immature. It was also noted that the aircraft's radar was inferior to that of the F-18A, and that F-16s could not fire the beyond-visual-range (BVR) air-to-air missiles and long-range anti-shipping missiles that the F-18A was capable of operating. In contrast, the <b>evaluation</b> <b>team</b> was impressed by the F-18A, and regarded it as being a more robust and survivable aircraft as it had been designed to operate from aircraft carriers; these features were important for operations from bare bases in northern Australia. Richardson and three other RAAF pilots test-flew F-18As, and reported that the aircraft handled well, but had some deficiencies with its flight control system and engines; these were not seen as major flaws by the <b>evaluation</b> <b>team,</b> however. The F-18A's twin engines were considered to be its main advantage over the single-engined F-16, as research conducted by the <b>evaluation</b> <b>team</b> found that the attrition rate for single-engined fighters was twice that for aircraft with two engines. Overall, however, the RAAF judged that both the F-16 and F-18A were too immature for a decision to be made in 1980 as had been originally planned, and recommended to the Government that this be deferred by a year.|$|E

These key findings present the strengths and challenges of using <b>evaluation</b> <b>teams,</b> along with recommendations {{for those interested in}} trying this approach. Recommendations include the following: <b>evaluation</b> <b>teams</b> need to create time, interest, expertise, a supportive context, a code of confidentiality, and an ethic of continuous improvement; teams need to customize the process to fit it to the site's unique needs and opportunities; teams should clarify evaluation's role in the larger program planning process; <b>teams</b> should develop <b>evaluation</b> procedures consonant with the company's culture; teams should use familiar and accessible resources; and teams need to be realistic.

5|$|The four tenders {{resulting}} from the study were submitted during October and November 1986. Although the IKL/HDW design was rated highest during the initial inspection, the <b>evaluation</b> <b>team</b> found that the German proposal was less attractive than previously thought. Although IKL/HDW claimed that their boat could meet the RAN's performance requirements, the evaluators concluded from the information provided that doing so would require the deactivation of all non-essential and some essential systems. Conversely, Kockums' proposal conceded {{that they did not}} meet the requirements, although evaluators found that the figures failed by only narrow margins, and believed that these were conservative. The <b>evaluation</b> <b>team</b> recalculated the capability statistics for both submarines to a common baseline, portraying the predicted Australian operating conditions, which generally saw Kockums' figures revised upwards, and those from IKL/HDW downwards. This resulted in growing support for the Type471 bid, and outcries from the IKL and HDW groups, who questioned the validity of the recalculations and if the Australian evaluators had the experience to do this correctly.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{his return}} to Australia, Raw was {{appointed}} Director of Operational Requirements at the Department of Air. In 1969 he headed an <b>evaluation</b> <b>team</b> tasked with selecting a heavy lift helicopter for the RAAF. The team {{was faced with a}} choice between the Boeing CH-47 Chinook and Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion, and Raw's final report recommended acquiring CH-53s. The RAAF's governing Air Board and senior Army officers rejected this recommendation, and CH-47s were purchased instead after Air Vice Marshal Charles Read also reviewed the performance of the two helicopters and concluded that the Chinook better met Australia's needs. Raw remained the Director of Operational Requirements until 1970 when he became the commandant of the RAAF Staff College. In 1972 he was promoted to air commodore and assumed command of RAAF Base Butterworth in Malaysia. Raw held this position until 1976 when he returned to Australia and became the senior training and staff officer in the headquarters of RAAF Support Command. This was his final military posting; he retired from the Air Force on 28 February 1978.|$|E

25|$|The DRF <b>evaluation</b> <b>team,</b> {{under the}} {{direction}} of Brigadier General Ronald W.

McDonnell Douglas, to assist 71-0291 in the evaluation, added to the program other F-15s, designated 78-0468, 80–0055 and 81-0063. The single-engine F-16XL was a promising design which, with its radically redesigned cranked-delta wing, greatly boosted performance; if selected, the single- and two-seat versions were to be designated F-16E and F-16F, respectively. On 24 February 1984, the USAF chose the F-15E; key factors in the decision were the F-15E's lower development costs compared to the F-16XL (US$270 million versus US$470 million), a belief that the F-15E had future growth potential, and possessing twin-engine redundancy. The USAF was initially expected to procure 400 aircraft, a figure later revised to 392.|$|E

40|$|The present {{article is}} {{concerned}} with organizational flexibility in transnational corporations (TNCs), i. e., larger firms that operate in multiple national markets. Contrasting prior research into entry modes (e. g. joint ventures, greenfield investments, or acquisitions), the present article examines the way the organization of <b>evaluation</b> <b>teams</b> can influence entry and exit decisions of business units. Empirical studies broadly support the claim that TNCs experiment with flexible organizational structures in response to increased levels of turbulence and uncertainty in international markets. However, these advances {{in the description of}} TNCs, and more generally in the literature on new organizational forms, have been largely ignored in our theories about evaluation of market opportunities in TNCs and multi-national corporations (MNCs). To address this gap in our knowledge, the present article examines the effects of flexible <b>evaluation</b> <b>teams</b> when TNCs assess the viability of international markets characterized by high levels of uncertainty. Remarkably, we show that TNCs employing flexible teams of (very) fallible evaluators can obtain profits at levels that asymptote optimality. Our main result supports the claim advanced in recent empirical studies. Structural flexibility can help TNCs employing (very) fallible evaluators achieve high levels o...|$|R
