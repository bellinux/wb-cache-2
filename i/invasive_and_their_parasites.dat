40|$|Interactions between insect hosts <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>parasites</b> are sig-nificant because <b>their</b> <b>parasites</b> {{can also}} be parasites of humans and of species that we utilize. Host–parasite interac-tions are complex, even in insects, and there can be hetero-geneous {{outcomes}} in infection success, load, virulence and transmission, with consequences {{for the evolution of}} hosts <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>parasites,</b> <b>and</b> also for epidemiology. A comprehen-sion that the triad of host, parasite and environment interact to dictate infection outcome is key for anyone interested in host–parasite research. Studies in model systems used to good effect to characterize insect immunity and infection rarely scrutinize such heterogeneity. Evolutionary ecology studies addressing natural variation offer a window on the causes and consequences of such heterogeneity. A system at the forefront in this area is that of bumblebees <b>and</b> <b>their</b> try-panosome <b>parasite</b> Crithidia. Placing results and interpreta-tions in a broader context we synthesize the plethora of work on bumblebee immunity and parasite interactions. We describe and discuss the sources of heterogeneity that should also be considered in human-relevant insect–parasite systems, including genotypic variation in both parasites and hosts, the mediating role of the environment, and explore the emerging evidence for microbiota modulating defence against parasites...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Accurate {{identification}} of fishes <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>parasites</b> {{is fundamental to}} the development, management and sustainability of fisheries and aquaculture worldwide. We examined three commercially and recreationally exploited Australian arripid species (Pisces: Arripidae), namely Australian herring (Arripis georgianus), eastern Australian salmon (A. trutta) and western Australian salmon (A. truttaceus), to determine <b>their</b> metazoan <b>parasite</b> assemblages <b>and</b> infection parameters. We identified 49 parasite species including 35 new parasite–host records and recognised seven ambiguous parasite–host records in the literature, largely a consequence of unsubstantiated host identifications in previous studies. Morphological and molecular methods confirmed a new western extension for the range of A. trutta,, 1000 km west of the previous record. Confusion about host identification and the range extension documented here has implications {{for the management of}} these economically important arripid species in southern Australian waters.

40|$|Biomagnification and polychlorinated {{biphenyl}} (PCB) congener distribution was examined in a predator-prey, host-parasite system, in which Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) preyed upon sprat (Sprattus sprattus). Eubothrium crassum was an intestinal parasite in salmon that also "preyed upon" sprat, because the parasites {{gained access to}} foodstuffs via the host (salmon) gut. Salmon contained significantly higher concentrations of total PCBs compared to both parasites and prey (sprat), but no difference in PCB concentration was found between sprat and E. crassum. Salmon biomagnified several PCB congeners from their diet (sprat), whereas parasites did not, {{despite the fact that}} both salmon <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>parasites</b> ingested the same prey. Differences in nutrient uptake mechanisms between the host <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>parasites,</b> in addition to the lack of a gastrointestinal tract in the cestode, may explain the lack of biomagnification in E. crassum. No difference was found in PCB congener distribution between parasites, salmon, and sprat. and none of the animal types showed a preference for accumulating more or less lipophilic congeners (congeners with a high or low octanol/water partition coefficient [K-ow]). Biomagnification factors for individual congeners in salmon did not increase with K-ow-rather, they were constant, as shown by a linear relationship for congener concentration in prey and predator...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} {{the evolution of}} host-parasite relationships in the genus Golovinomyces (Ascomycete: Erysiphaceae), which are obligate parasitic fungi of plants, we investigated the phylogenetic relationships of the genus based on 60 internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and 41 28 S rDNA sequences. Five major groups, each represented by isolates from a single tribe of the Asteraceae, were identified in the taxa analyzed in this study. Host plants of four groups were strictly restricted to the Asteraceae. The fifth group, the Lactuceae group, is a large group composed of isolates collected from the tribe Lactuceae of the Asteraceae and all other plant families, which suggests a close affinity between Golovinomyces and the Asteraceae {{in the early stages}} of their evolution. Tree topology comparisons between the asteraceous hosts <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>parasites</b> suggest that Golovinomyces diverged along with the phylogeny of host tribes Carsueae, Astereae, Heliantheae, and Lactuceae of the Asteraceae. However, a conflict of branching order between the tribe Anthemideae <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>parasites</b> suggests that host-jumping has occurred in the tribe Anthemideae. Consequently, we suggest that there are two different phases in the evolutionary history of the host-parasite relationships of Golovinomyces. One phase is divergence in accord with the phylogeny of their hosts, whic...|$|R

Cospeciation implies that lineages of hosts and parasites diverge in parallel {{at the same}} time, but testing this prediction requires time-calibrated phylogenies, which are particularly difficult to obtain in organisms that leave few fossils.

40|$|With few exceptions, {{parasitic}} manipulation dramatically reduces host fitness. That said, {{evidence of}} host resistance to behavior-manipulating parasites is scarce. Here, {{we suggest that}} the evolution of partial resistance, as well as bypass, to manipulation (PRM and BPM, respectively) represents new, seldom-explored options for parasitized hosts. Natural selection could favor hosts that partially resist certain manipulative dimensions to postpone <b>their</b> death <b>and</b> perform additional reproductive episodes (PRM). Alternatively, manipulated hosts may express novel traits that do not alter the manipulation per se but that alleviate its detrimental fitness consequences (BPM). If effective, PRM and BPM have many implications for the ecology and evolution of hosts <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>parasites,</b> especially the evolution of multidimensional manipulations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{interaction}} between hosts and parasites {{is characterized by}} the evolution of reciproca adaptations aiming at reducing the cost of infection (from the host point of view) and to optimize host exploitation (from the parasite point of view). Within this co-evolutionary scenario, the immune system takes a central role. The immune system has evolved to fight off parasitic attacks. However, immune defences cannot be deployed without costs which set a limit to the protective effect of immunity. Moreover, immune defences impose strong selection pressures on the parasite and can favour the evolution of more virulent pathogen strains. In this article, we will discuss these different issues focusing on host-pathogen interactions involving birds <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>parasites...</b>|$|R

There is also a seasonal threshold in terms of the overlap between the breeding seasons of the northern mockingbirds <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>parasites.</b> If the breeding season of the parasites starts later, there is less likelihood of parasitism.
