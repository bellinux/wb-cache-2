5|$|After his training, Rane {{was posted}} to the 28th Field Company, an {{engineering}} {{unit of the}} 26th Infantry Division which, at the time, was fighting the Japanese in Burma. As his division retreated from the Japanese after the failed Arakan Campaign, he, along with his two sections, was hand-picked by his company commander to stay back behind at Buthidaung to destroy key assets and then be evacuated by the Royal Indian Navy. Though the objective was soon achieved, the expected pickup did not <b>happen.</b> <b>This</b> forced Rane and his men to cross a river that was patrolled by the Japanese to reach their lines. Rane, along with his two sections, expertly evaded the Japanese troops, and joined the 26th Infantry Division at Bahri. For his actions, {{he was promoted to}} havaldar (sergeant).|$|E

50|$|Currently, {{candidates}} {{are allowed to}} contest elections simultaneously from two seats. If a candidate wins from both the seats, a by-election <b>happens.</b> <b>This</b> requires additional expenditure, resources and participation of many. A by-election that <b>happens</b> <b>this</b> way is also an indication {{of a lack of}} respect towards the citizens of that constituency. There has thus been suggestions of allowing candidates to contest only from a single seat.|$|R

25|$|Coppicing of willow, alder and poplar {{for energy}} wood has proven commercially successful. The Willow Biomass Project in the United States {{is an example}} of this. In this case the {{coppicing}} is done in a way that an annual or more likely a tri-annual cut can <b>happen.</b> <b>This</b> seems to maximize the production volume from the stand. Such frequent growth means the soils can be easily depleted and so fertlizers are often required. The stock also becomes exhausted after some years and so will be replaced with new plants. The method of harvesting of energy wood can be mechanized by adaptation of specialized agricultural machinery.|$|E
25|$|A graded poset (with {{positive}} integer ranks) cannot {{have any}} elements x for which arbitrarily long chains with greatest element x exist, as otherwise {{it would have}} to have elements of arbitrarily small (and eventually negative) rank. For instance, the integers (with the usual order) cannot be a graded poset, nor can any interval (with more than one element) of rational or real numbers. (In particular, graded posets are well-founded, meaning that they satisfy the descending chain condition (DCC): they do not contain any infinite descending chains. has arbitrarily long chains descending fromnbsp&, but has no infinite descending chains.) Henceforth we shall therefore only consider posets in which this does not <b>happen.</b> <b>This</b> implies that whenever xnbsp&<nbsp&y we can get from x to y by repeatedly choosing a cover, finitely many times. It also means that (for positive integer rank functions) compatibility of ρ with the ordering follows from the requirement about covers. As a variant of the definition of a graded poset, Birkhoff allows rank functions to have arbitrary (rather than only nonnegative) integer values. In this variant, the integers can be graded (by the identity function) in his setting, and the compatibility of ranks with the ordering is not redundant. As a third variant, Brightwell and West define a rank function to be integer-valued, but don't require its compatibility with the ordering; hence this variant can grade even e.g. the real numbers by any function, as the requirement about covers is vacuous for this example.|$|E

500|$|The most {{important}} written references to Vistulans come from The Life of Saint Methodius, {{also known as}} [...] "The Pannonian Legend", most likely written by disciples of Methodius right {{after his death in}} 885. The fragment speaks of a very powerful pagan prince who resided in the Vistulan country, reviled the Christians and caused them great harm. He was warned by emissaries speaking on behalf of the missionary and advised to reform and voluntarily accept baptism in his own homeland. Otherwise, it was predicted, he would be forced to do so in a foreign land. According to the Pannonian Legend, that is exactly what eventually did <b>happen.</b> <b>This</b> passage is widely interpreted as an indication that the Vistulans were invaded and overrun by the army of Great Moravia and their pagan prince captured. This would have had to have happened during Methodius' second stay in Moravia, between 873 and 885, during the reign of Svatopluk I.|$|E

500|$|In a February 11, 2011 Entertainment Weekly article, veteran script {{supervisor}} Sandy Schklair {{announced that}} he desired credit for directing The Room. Schklair told EW shortly after being hired on as script supervisor, Wiseau became too engrossed with his acting duties to direct the film properly; according to Schklair, Wiseau then asked him to [...] "tell the actors what to do, and yell 'Action' and 'Cut' and tell the cameraman what shots to get." [...] The script supervisor {{also said that he}} had a conversation with Wiseau in which he refused to give up the title of [...] "director", but asked Schklair to [...] "direct [...] movie." [...] The story is corroborated by {{at least one of the}} film's actors, who requested anonymity for the story. Wiseau has dismissed Schklair's comments. Greg Sestero's memoir The Disaster Artist about the making of The Room partially corroborates Schklair's version of events, describing him taking charge of numerous sequences in which Wiseau found himself unable to remember lines properly or adequately interact with the rest of the cast, but jokes that claiming directorial credit was like [...] "claiming to have been the Hindenburg's principal aeronautics engineer". Wiseau said of Schklair's assertion, [...] "Well, this is so laughable that… you know what? I don’t know, probably only in America it can <b>happen,</b> <b>this</b> kind of stuff." ...|$|E

[...] Di Grassi revealed his team's objective was to secure victory in Buenos Aires and accumlate as many possible points, and felt the circuit would suit his car following development to the vehicle over the winter. After being unable to win in Marrakesh because of various issues, Rosenqvist revealed that he gathered his team members for a meeting to discuss improvements and set himself the objective of securing his first victory in the series while also utilising his team's simulator to prepare himself for the Buenos Aires race. Bird, the race's defending winner, stated Buemi was the one to watch out for and hoped to avoid the poor results from the season's previous two races in Buenos Aires. Oliver Turvey felt in the previous year, he quickly gained confidence with driving the track and was looking forward to continuing his team's development and expected to challenge for a podium or race victory.|$|E
