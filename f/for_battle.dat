5|$|A small navy had {{operated}} at {{a fairly}} low level after about 300 BC, {{but it was}} massively upgraded about forty years later, during the First Punic War. After a period of frenetic construction, the navy mushroomed to a size of more than 400 ships on the Carthaginian ("Punic") pattern. Once completed, it could accommodate up to 100,000 sailors and embarked troops <b>for</b> <b>battle.</b> The navy thereafter declined in size.|$|E

5|$|Offsetting these handicaps, the Prussian Army had {{excellent}} and professional leadership in its General Staff organisation. These officers came from four schools developed {{for this purpose}} and thus worked to a common standard of training. This system was {{in marked contrast to}} the conflicting, vague orders issued by the French army. This staff system ensured that before Ligny, three-quarters of the Prussian army concentrated <b>for</b> <b>battle</b> with 24 hours notice.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of {{what time}} {{they entered the}} straits, the Persians did not move to attack the Allies until daylight. Since they were not {{planning}} to flee after all, the Allies {{would have been able}} to spend the night preparing <b>for</b> <b>battle,</b> and after a speech by Themistocles, the marines boarded and the ships made ready to sail.|$|E

5|$|Tournaments and hastiludes {{began in}} the 11th century as both a sport and to provide {{training}} <b>for</b> <b>battle.</b> Usually taking {{the form of a}} melee, the participants used the horses, armour and weapons of war. The sport of jousting grew out of the tournament and, by the 15th century, the art of tilting became quite sophisticated. In the process, the pageantry and specialization became less war-like, perhaps because of the knight's changing role in war.|$|E
5|$|Unbeknownst to the Byzantines, Khalid had {{prepared}} {{for such a}} contingency by placing a strong outpost line in front during the night to counter surprises, which gave the Muslims time to prepare <b>for</b> <b>battle.</b> At the center, the Byzantines did not press hard, intending to pin down the Muslim centre corps in their position and preventing them from aiding the Muslim army in other areas. Thus the center remained stable.|$|E
5|$|A scout alerted Muhammad of the Meccan army's {{presence}} and numbers late on Thursday March 21. The next morning, a Muslim conference of war convened, {{and there was}} dispute over how to best repel the Meccans. Muhammad {{and many of the}} senior figures suggested that it would be safer to fight within Medina and take advantage of its heavily fortified strongholds. Younger Muslims argued that the Meccans were destroying their crops, and that huddling in the strongholds would destroy Muslim prestige. Muhammad eventually conceded to the wishes of the latter, and readied the Muslim force <b>for</b> <b>battle.</b>|$|E

5|$|A small navy had {{operated}} at {{a fairly}} low level after the Second Samnite War, {{but it was}} massively upgraded during this period, expanding from a few primarily river- and coastal-based patrol craft to a full maritime unit. After a period of frenetic construction, the navy mushroomed to a size of more than 400 ships on the Carthaginian pattern. Once completed, it could accommodate up to 100,000 sailors and embarked troops <b>for</b> <b>battle.</b> The navy thereafter declined in size. This was partially because a pacified Roman Mediterranean called for little naval policing, and partially because the Romans chose to rely during this period on ships provided by Greek cities, whose peoples had greater maritime experience.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} {{news about}} the stolen ammunition, Colonel Stone prepares his regiment <b>for</b> <b>battle.</b> From their cell, the captives see the outmatched Bengal Lancers deployed to assault Khan's fortress. They manage to escape and ultimately destroy the ammunition tower, and young Stone redeems himself by killing Khan with a dagger. With their ammunition gone and headquarters in ruins {{as a result of}} the battle, the remaining rebels surrender. However, McGregor, who was mainly responsible for the destruction of the ammunition tower, is killed in the assault. To recognize their battlefield bravery and military effort, Forsythe and Lieutenant Stone are awarded the Distinguished Service Order and McGregor posthumously receives the prestigious Victoria Cross, with McGregor's horse awarded the medal on his behalf.|$|E
5|$|As Caroline neared Batavia, Phoenix {{entered the}} well-defended harbour, making further pursuit impossible. However, Rainier then sighted a second frigate, {{lying at anchor}} in Batavia Roads, {{accompanied}} only by the 14-gun corvette William, the elusive brig Zee-Ploeg, and the 18-gun ship Patriot {{that belonged to the}} Dutch East India Company. Prisoners from Zeerop identified this ship as the 36-gun Maria Riggersbergen under Captain Claas Jager. Although this force was significantly stronger than Caroline, and could call on the support of approximately 30 gunboats anchored closer inshore, Rainier immediately gave orders to advance on the Dutch frigate. In his preparations <b>for</b> <b>battle,</b> Rainier ordered that springs be placed on his anchor cables, giving his ship the ability to easily turn at anchor to face new threats once engaged with the Maria Riggersbergen.|$|E

5|$|As a child, Usama was {{the second}} of four boys and raised by his nurse, Lu'lu'a, who had also raised his father and would later raise Usama's own children. He was {{encouraged}} by his father to memorize the Qur'an, and was also tutored by scholars such as Ibn Munira of Kafartab and Abu Abdullah al-Tulaytuli of Toledo. He {{spent much of his}} youth hunting with his family, partly as recreation and certainly as warrior (faris) training <b>for</b> <b>battle</b> as part of furusiyya. He also had much direct experience of battle, against the neighbouring crusader County of Tripoli and Principality of Antioch, hostile Muslim neighbours in Hama, Homs, and elsewhere, and Hashshashin who had established a base near Shaizar.|$|E
5|$|As the {{combined}} Texian force prepared <b>for</b> <b>battle,</b> they sent a messenger to instruct the alcalde {{of the city}} to surrender. At 11pm, the alcade responded that the town would remain neutral, neither surrendering nor fighting. Several of the locals did, however, supply axes to the Texian militia. The Texians divided themselves into four groups, each assigned a different approach to the presidio. In the pre-dawn hours of October 10, the Texians attacked. The lone sentinel managed to give the alarm but was immediately shot dead. The Texians quickly hacked through a door on the north wall of the fortress and ran to the interior courtyard. Hearing the commotion, the Mexican soldiers had lined the walls to defend the fort.|$|E
5|$|At Battle of Novi, his {{division}} {{was part of}} Laurent Saint-Cyr's right wing. At the battle itself, his troops {{were the only ones}} properly positioned; the rest of the French army was otherwise out of place and unready <b>for</b> <b>battle.</b> He and Saint-Cyr held the center of the French line, beating off two Russian assaults. After the French defeat at Novi, he went with Saint-Cyr to Savona, where he participated in operations around Genoa. Eventually, he rejoined Moreau to campaign in southwestern Germany, culminating in the Battle of Hohenlinden.|$|E

5|$|Both fleets were {{at first}} {{hampered}} by light and changeable winds. When a consistent west wind appeared on 20June, Hughes lined up <b>for</b> <b>battle</b> and awaited Suffren's action. Lining up {{in a similar}} formation, Suffren gave the order to attack, and battle began shortly after four in the afternoon. The action lasted around three hours and resulted in no major damage to ships in either fleet, despite all ships being engaged. The British had 99 men killed and 434 wounded; French casualties amounted to 102 killed and 386 wounded.|$|E

As they are about to break through, the outer gates of the Castle are breached by the giant Wun Wun, followed by Tormund Giantsbane and an army of Wildlings, who have returned with Dolorous Edd. Outnumbered, the Night's Watchmen lay down their arms, and Alliser and the mutineers are dragged off to the cells under Edd's orders.|$|E
5|$|During the war, Machias men {{refitted}} {{and armed}} {{a variety of}} ships—including the Margaretta—and sailed off looking <b>for</b> <b>battle</b> with the British. The Machias Liberty and the Diligent were used to intercept merchant ships that were supplying the British in the Siege of Boston. Jeremiah O'Brien and John Lambert built a twenty-gun ship and began privateering under an American letter of marque. Both men were commissioned into the Continental Navy for their work. O'Brien was captured {{off the coast of}} New York in late 1777, but was able to escape from prison in Britain to continue privateering throughout the war.|$|E
