The NTSC signal includes a short sample of this reference signal, known as the colorburst, located on the 'back porch' of each <b>horizontal</b> <b>synchronization</b> pulse. The color burst consists of a minimum of eight cycles of the unmodulated (fixed phase and amplitude) color subcarrier.

Color TV has been said to really be colored TV because of the total separation of the brightness part of the picture from the color portion. In CRT televisions, the NTSC signal is turned into three color signals called Red, Green and Blue, each controlling that color electron gun. TV sets with digital circuitry use sampling techniques to process the signals but the end result is the same.

40|$|Abstract—A {{phase-locked loop}} (PLL) for analog video RGB signal {{acquisition}} interface requires precise clock generation {{from a very}} noisy and low-frequency <b>horizontal</b> <b>synchronization</b> signal (HSYNC). In such applications, the frequency multiplication ratio is always larger than 800 and can be up to over 2600. The output pixel clock has to be phase aligned to the HSYNC. Otherwise, the displayed image will become blurry. A fast phase tracking all-digital PLL (ADPLL) for video pixel clock generation in a 65 nm CMOS technology is presented in this paper. In the pro-posed ADPLL, the digital loop filter eliminates the reference clock jitter effects and then the period jitter of the output pixel clock can be reduced. A time-to-digital converter (TDC) and a delta-sigma modulator (DSM) are used to perform the fast phase tracking, and the tracking jitter is controlled at less {{than one-third of the}} output pixel clock period. As compared to prior studies, the proposed ADPLL does not require an extra external oscillator to overcome the reference clock jitter effects. Thus, it has a small chip area and low power consumption, and is well-suited to video pixel clock generation applications in 65 nm CMOS process.

40|$|Tax {{is one of}} {{the fiscal}} policy {{instruments}} that can be used by the government. In such terms, legal products regulating taxation (i. e. tax law) has two dichotomic functions : budgetary and regular function. The former function is stressed on efforts to contribute money as much as possible to the government treasury. The later function is more stressed on how to use tax instruments in order to achieve certain goals outside the state's financial field, which can take form of promotion or prevention of certain condition. Taking "The Function of Income Tax Regulation as an Instrument to Promote Investment" as the title, this thesis analyses the government's taxation policy (mostly on Income Tax) in connection with the development of both domestic or foreign investment. Having taken the year 1967 to now as the analysis period, the writer divides the length of time into three periods, those are the period before the taxation reforms, the period after the first taxation reforms (1983) and the period after the second taxation reforms (1994). What lies behind the partition of the time into three periods is the tension characteristic between the budgetary and regular function. This thesis will be focussed on how is the regulation function of taxation after the second taxation reforms (1994), how is the regulation function of that period compared to the previous periods, how is the implementation of taxation policy and its impact to investment in Indonesia. The objectives of this research are to make detailed list of statutory laws that have been used as an instrument to promote investment, to analyse vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>synchronization</b> of the laws, and to study the implementation and the effect of that government policy in investment field. The method that is used in this research is a combination between the normative and sociolegal research. The reason for adopting this combination is solely based on the different research issues and objectives. These strategic findings that can be revealed from the research outcome and data analysis are as follows : 1. 	During the three period of taxation policy, the government has issued many statutory laws that serve as an instrument to promote investment. Afterall, if comparison is made, the period in which those laws were mostly issued is the first period, then followed by the third and the second period. We may conclude that the emphasis of regulation function in each period has the same sequence. 2. 	In terms of both vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>synchronization,</b> we may draw a conclusion that most of the statutory laws meet the requirements to be the laws with two faces (das doppelte reehtsantlitz). But, if we	notice the <b>horizontal</b> <b>synchronization,</b>	legal problems will arise {{from the fact that the}} Act Number 7 / 1983 never expressly abolishes the articles on the application of tax facilities that are contained in the Act Number 1 / 1967 and Number 6 / 1968. In terms of vertical synchronization, the issuance of Inpres No. 2 / 1996 jo. Keppres No. 42 / 1996 lacks of any delegative and atributive legitimation. Inpres No. 90 / 1995 jo. Inpres No. 3 / 1996 has contra-productive nature as well as it is insufficient to serve as the foundation of transferring wealth from private to public sector that has tax as its substance. 3. Lacks of implementation of statutory laws that give tax facilities to business world during the second period was caused by unclear criteria as well as by insufficient socialization of the laws among taxation executives and economic actors. The analysis	on effects	of taxation policy toward the growth of investment reveals that there are direct effects, which is caused by the nature statutory of law as initial pusher toward the desired objectives. Moreover, since taxation facility is not a single factor that can influence enthusiasm of investors to invest, the withdrawal of taxation facility does not automatically positively corelated to the increase or decrease of investment growth rate. Finally, from the strategic findings of this research, the following points need to be recommended : 1. 	The government should establish the implementing laws based on both delegation and atribution principle in order to implement taxation policy promoting investment 2. 	Any statutory law which will be issued has to be seen in connection with prevailing statutory laws in order to make horizontal and vertical synchronization. 3. 	The government has to be more agressive, - but selective -, in giving tax facilities so that Indonesia can grab the capital flow, mostly in global context. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{elimination}} of shifted and attenuated {{replicas of the}} main image caused by multipath propagation in video transmission has been generating increased interest. We present a delayed least mean squares (DLMS) traversal, systolic pipelined adaptive filter which supports an adequately high sampling rate. We do not introduce any tracking delay for systolization while requiring significantly reduced adaptation delay and silicon area, and providing a sufficient high SNR in the de-ghosted image. Both pre-ghosts and post-ghosts are efficiently cancelled. The modularity of the system permits filter-order scaling without additional design effort or a degradation in the system clock rate. We achieve systolization by first creating an f-slow simulator of the DLMS algorithm, with a system clock rate that is f times the sampling rate, and then folding the adaptation and filtering computations of each tap on to a single multiply-accumulate hardware module. We further pipeline the system {{to the level of}} a 4 → 2 compressor using carry-save arithmetic for both the multiply and the add operations, so that the system sustains a sampling rate of 1 /(ft_A), where t_A is the combinational delay through the compressor. We use the <b>horizontal</b> <b>synchronization</b> pulse as our ghost cancelling reference. This has all the desired features of a good adaptation reference signal and ensures that the system impulse response is updated once in every horizontal retrace.

However, {{the mechanisms of}} bipolar electro-coagulation are not completely known. We studied the acute cortical blood flow and histological changes after bipolar electro-coagulation in 24 patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. Methods: Twenty-four patients were consecutively enrolled, and divided into three groups according to the date of admission. The regional cortical blood flow (rCBF), electrocorticography, the depth of cortex damage, and acute histological changes (H and E staining, neuronal staining and neurofilament (NF) staining) were analyzed {{before and after the}} operation. The t-test analysis was used to compare the rCBF before and after the operation. Results: The rCBF after coagulation was significantly reduced (P < 0. 05). The spikes were significantly reduced after electro-coagulation. For the temporal cortex, the depth of cortical damage with output power of 2 - 9 W after electro-coagulation was 0. 34 ± 0. 03, 0. 48 ± 0. 06, 0. 69 ± 0. 06, 0. 84 ± 0. 09, 0. 98 ± 0. 08, 1. 10 ± 0. 11, 1. 11 ± 0. 09, and 1. 22 ± 0. 11 mm, respectively. Coagulation with output power of 4 - 5 W completely damaged the neurons and NF protein in the molecular layer, external granular layer, and external pyramidal layer. Conclusions: The electro-coagulation not only destroyed the neurons and NF protein, but also reduced the rCBF. We concluded that the injuries caused by electro-coagulation would prevent <b>horizontal</b> <b>synchronization</b> and spread of epileptic discharges, and partially destroy the epileptic focus...|$|E

Dual whole-cell recordings revealed that prolonged bursts were synchronized in layer VI, VP, and RTN. Bursts {{were present in}} cortex isolated from thalamus, but not in thalamus isolated from cortex, indicating that bursts originated in cortex and propagated to thalamus. Prolonged bursts were synchronized in layer VI when vertical cuts extended from pia mater through layers IV or V, but were no longer synchronized when cuts extended through layer VI and white matter. In voltage-clamp recordings before P 10, burst conductance of all three neuronal populations was dominated by the NMDA receptor-mediated conductance, and therefore synapses were “silent”. In cortex and RTN, after P 10, bursts were associated with strong AMPA/kainate receptor-mediated conductances, and synapses had become “functional”; silent synapses persisted in {{a large proportion of}} VP cells after P 10. Before P 9, the NMDA receptor antagonist APV or the non-NMDA receptor antagonist CNQX blocked the prolonged bursts.

Loops and statements that belong to strongly connected data paths are vertically fused, whenever possible, in order to promote chaining, register, and cache reuse. To reduce loop <b>synchronization,</b> <b>horizontal</b> fusion is also used for independent loops having compatible dependence types. Finally, vector operations are scheduled based on knowledge of the timing of arithmetic pipelines, load and store operations, and management of the available resource. Testing is carried out using synthetic Fortran programs on the Convex C 240 vector multiprocessor. The proposed loop fusion improves the speedup by 18 to 43 % over the C 240 commercial optimizing compiler. Chaining-oriented scheduling and allocation yields 9 to 15 % improvement over the highest optimization option of the C 240 compiler. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc...|$|R
5000|$|The 59.94 rate {{is derived}} from the {{following}} calculations. Designers chose to make the chrominance subcarrier frequency an n + 0.5 multiple of the line frequency to minimize interference between the luminance signal and the chrominance signal. (Another way this is often stated is that the color subcarrier frequency is an odd multiple of half the line frequency.) They then chose to make the audio subcarrier frequency an integer multiple of the line frequency to minimize visible (intermodulation) interference between the audio signal and the chrominance signal. The original black-and-white standard, with its 15,750 Hz line frequency and 4.5 MHz audio subcarrier, does not meet these requirements, so designers had either to raise the audio subcarrier frequency or lower the line frequency. Raising the audio subcarrier frequency would prevent existing (black and white) receivers from properly tuning in the audio signal. Lowering the line frequency is comparatively innocuous, because the <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>synchronization</b> information in the NTSC signal allows a receiver to tolerate a substantial amount of variation in the line frequency. So the engineers chose the line frequency to be changed for the color standard. In the black-and-white standard, the ratio of audio subcarrier frequency to line frequency is [...] 285.71. In the color standard, this becomes rounded to the integer 286, which means the color standard's line rate is [...] &asymp; 15,734 Hz. Maintaining the same number of scan lines per field (and frame), the lower line rate must yield a lower field rate. Dividing [...] lines by 262.5 lines per field gives approximately 59.94 fields per second.|$|R
