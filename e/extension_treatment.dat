Axon retraction in response to ephrin-A 2 correlated with decreased F-actin turnover and required RhoA activity.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] Several {{studies have}} shown that {{residential}} location (urban or rural) influences the incidence of colorectal cancer. The aim was to investigate the influence of rural environment on colorectal cancer history and survival in a well defined population. DESIGN [...] Patients with colorectal cancer diagnosed in the department of Calvados (France) were classified by place of residence (urban/rural) and information on clinical symptoms, tumour <b>extension,</b> <b>treatment,</b> and survival was collected. SETTING [...] The study was population based, in the department of Calvados in France. PATIENTS [...] During 1978 - 1984, 1445 colorectal cancers were collected by the Digestive Tract Cancer Registry of Calvados, 1047 with an urban place of residence (544 males and 503 females) and 284 with a rural place of residence (134 males and 150 females). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] In both sexes, rural patients with colorectal cancers were treated less frequently in a specialised health care centre (40. 0 %) than patients from an urban population (53. 4 %). The difference was mainly but not entirely explained by distance from the specialised health care centre. In females in the rural population, cancers were diagnosed more frequently at the stage of severe clinical symptoms (22. 1 %) and metastases (18. 8 %) {{than they were in the}} urban population (15. 5 % and 12. 3 %). In addition among females a rural environment appeared to confer a worse prognosis (relative risk = 1. 3). CONCLUSIONS [...] Our findings suggest an inequality between rural and urban populations, especially for women. The loneliness of rural women leads to a delay in diagnosis and worse survival. In health education campaigns on colorectal cancer, efforts must be made to provide medical information to rural women in order to reduce the delay in diagnosis and improve survival...|$|E

40|$|After {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI), poor {{regeneration}} of damaged axons of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) causes limited functional recovery. This limited spontaneous functional recovery has been attributed, to a large extent, to the plasticity of propriospinal neurons, especially the descending propriospinal neurons (dPSNs). Compared with the supraspinal counterparts, dPSNs have displayed significantly greater regenerative capacity, which can be further enhanced by glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). In the present study, we applied a G-mutated rabies virus (G-Rabies) co-expressing green fluorescence protein (GFP) to reveal Golgi-like dendritic morphology of dPSNs. We also investigated the neurotransmitters expressed by dPSNs after labeling with a retrograde tracer Fluoro-Gold (FG). dPSNs were examined in animals with sham injuries or complete spinal transections with or without GDNF treatment. Bilateral injections of G-Rabies and FG were made into the 2 nd lumbar (L 2) spinal cord at 3 days prior to a spinal cord transection performed at the 11 th thoracic level (T 11). The lesion gap was filled with Gelfoam containing either saline or GDNF in the injury groups. Four days post-injury, the rats were sacrificed for analysis. For those animals receiving G-rabies injection, the GFP signal in the T 7 - 9 spinal cord was visualized via 2 -photon microscopy. Dendritic morphology from stack images was traced and analyzed using a Neurolucida software. We found that dPSNs in sham injured animals had a predominantly dorsal-ventral distribution of dendrites. Transection injury resulted in alterations in the dendritic distribution with dorsal-ventral retraction and lateral-medial <b>extension.</b> <b>Treatment</b> with GDNF significantly increased the terminal dendritic length of dPSNs. The density of spine-like structures was increased after injury, and treatment with GDNF enhanced this effect. For the group receiving FG injections, immunohistochemistry for glutamate, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), glycine, and GABA was performed in the T 7 - 9 spinal cord. We show that the majority of FG retrogradely-labeled dPSNs were located in the Rexed Lamina VII. Over 90 % of FG-labeled neurons were glutamatergic, with the other three neurotransmitters contributing less than 10 % of the total. To our knowledge this is the first report describing the morphologic characteristics of dPSNs and their neurotransmitter expressions, as well as the dendritic response of dPSNs after transection injury and GDNF treatment...|$|E
