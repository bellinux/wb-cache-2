25|$|In November 2011, a new {{constitution}} was approved. This constitution was voted although the text to be approved was not distributed nor was its content revealed to the public before the vote. Under the {{new constitution}} the president was limited {{to a maximum of}} two seven-year terms and he would be both the head of state and head of the government, therefore eliminating the figure of prime minister. The new constitution also introduced the figure of a vice president and it also called {{for the creation of a}} 70-member senate with 55 elected by the people and the 15 remaining designated by the president.

25|$|Having {{made clear}} that he wanted Dara to succeed him, Shah Jahan became ill with stranguary in 1657 and was closeted {{under the care of}} his {{favourite}} son in the newly built city of Shahjahanabad (Old Delhi). Rumours of the death of Shah Jahan abounded and the younger sons were concerned that Dara might be hiding it for Machiavellian reasons. Thus, they took action: Shah Shuja prepared to contest the throne from Bengal, where he had been governor since 1637, while Murad did the same in his governorship of Gujarat and Aurangzeb did so in the Deccan. It is not known whether these preparations were made in the mistaken belief that the rumours of death were true or whether the challengers were <b>just</b> <b>taking</b> advantage of the situation.|$|E
25|$|Historically, some {{doubted that}} fish could {{experience}} pain. Laboratory experiments {{have shown that}} fish do react to painful stimuli (e.g., injections of bee venom) {{in a similar way}} to mammals. This is controversial and has been disputed. The expansion of fish farming as well as animal welfare concerns in society has led to research into more humane and faster ways of killing fish. In large-scale operations like fish farms, stunning fish with electricity or putting them into water saturated with nitrogen so that they cannot breathe, results in death more rapidly than <b>just</b> <b>taking</b> them out of the water. For sport fishing, it is recommended that fish be killed soon after catching them by hitting them on the head followed by bleeding out or by stabbing the brain with a sharp object (called pithing or ike jime in Japanese).|$|E

25|$|Once Henry had {{withdrawn}} with {{the bulk of}} the imperial army the towns that had supposedly fallen to the Empire immediately declared their allegiance to Tancred, for the most part now fearing his retribution. Nicholas of Ajello, son of Matthew and former Archbishop of Salerno, who was helping defend Naples, wrote letters about the events to his friends in Salerno. Thus the populace of Salerno saw an opportunity to win some favour with Tancred, so they besieged the defenseless Constance at Castel Terracena. Constance presented herself on a balcony and spoke to them in the tone of mild remonstrance and admonition, trying to tell them that the situation might improve and the defeat of Henry might be exaggerated by Nicholas, but the Salernitans were determined to capture her for Tancred, so they continued the siege. Constance locked herself in her room, locked the windows, and prayed to God for help and revenge. After a rapid negotiation with Elia di Gesualdo, a distant relative of Tancred, Constance voluntarily went out under the condition that her German garrison were to be allowed to leave unharmed. She was then arrested by Elia (and some barons of Apulia who were related to her) and delivered to Tancred in Messina by Admiral Margaritus of Brindisi (her brother-in-law who had helped in the defence of Naples), on a bireme galley or dromon with 200 rowers. She was in her attire as empress, wearing a dress quilted with gold and decorated with roses, a cloak covered with precious jewels, and her hair was strewn with gems, making her look like a goddess. Thus she became an important and valuable prize given that Henry had every intention of returning. When meeting Constance Tancred blamed her for the invasion, but she proudly responded that she was <b>just</b> <b>taking</b> back her dominion robbed by Tancred.|$|E

500|$|The album's lyrics, {{written by}} Yorke, are more {{abstract}} compared to his personal, emotional lyrics for The Bends. Critic Alex Ross said the lyrics [...] "seemed {{a mixture of}} overheard conversations, techno-speak, and fragments of a harsh diary" [...] with [...] "images of riot police at political rallies, anguished lives in tidy suburbs, yuppies freaking out, sympathetic aliens gliding overhead." [...] Recurring themes include transport, technology, insanity, death, modern British life, globalisation and anti-capitalism. Yorke said: [...] "On this album, the outside world became all there was... I'm <b>just</b> <b>taking</b> Polaroids of things around me moving too fast." [...] He told Q: [...] "It was like there's a secret camera {{in a room and}} it's watching the character who walks in—a different character for each song. The camera's not quite me.

500|$|After {{being dropped}} by Columbia, the band {{set off to}} Brazil to support All Time Low in January 2011. They {{subsequently}} began recording their fifth studio album with producer and longtime friend Ed Ackerson at his studio, Flowers Studio, in Minneapolis. The band recorded on their own time with their own resources, which both provided comfort {{and a sense of}} nervousness to the group. They did not sit down and preconceive the album as a change in style, but rather relaxed and took their time writing it. [...] "We just felt like it was like we were <b>just</b> <b>taking</b> our time and just kinda living life and not worrying about too much other than getting together and making music," [...] remarked Taylor. Pierre has since looked back on Go with mixed emotions, citing it as his personal least favorite album by the band.

500|$|In the film, {{similar to}} the Brothers Grimm story, the Evil Queen is cold, cruel, and {{extremely}} vain, and obsessively desires to remain the [...] "fairest in the land". She becomes madly envious over the beauty of her stepdaughter, Princess Snow White, {{as well as the}} attentions of the Prince from another land; such love triangle element is one of Disney's changes to the story. This leads her to plot the death of Snow White and ultimately on the path to her own demise, which in the film is indirectly caused by the Seven Dwarfs. The film's version of the Queen character uses her dark magic powers to actually transform herself into an old woman instead of <b>just</b> <b>taking</b> a disguise like in the Grimms' story; this appearance of hers is commonly referred to as the Wicked Witch or alternatively as the Old Hag or just the [...] Witch. The Queen dies in the film, but lives on in a variety of non-canonical Disney works.|$|E

Before 20th Century Fox greenlit Alien vs. Predator, James Cameron had been collaborating on the plot for a fifth Alien film with another writer.

One Fire Department lieutenant was quoted describing colleagues as desperate for help with the distress they felt {{in the aftermath of the}} attacks, to the point that they would try anything. Fire Department officials raised concerns about the project, saying that firefighters were being required to give up inhalers, pills and other orthodox medication. Two weeks into the program, one firefighter passed out and was taken to an emergency room with severe asthma, later saying that he had been asked to stop using his inhaler. According to the clinic's associate medical director, Dr. Kawabena Nyamekye, participants were being helped off medication at their own insistence, not at the request of Downtown Medical. A former worker at Downtown Medical told reporters that staff were discouraged from calling for an ambulance even in an emergency, and that one of them had been required to break off contact with her boyfriend because he had left Scientology. A spokesman responded that the clinic had [...] "a clear policy of calling 911 when needed." ...|$|E
500|$|Before 20th Century Fox gave Alien vs. Predator the greenlight, Aliens writer/{{director}} James Cameron {{had been}} working on a story for a fifth Alien film. Alien director Ridley Scott had talked with Cameron, stating [...] "I {{think it would be a}} lot of fun, but the most important thing is to get the story right." [...] In a 2002 interview, Scott's concept for a story was [...] "to go back to where the alien creatures were first found and explain how they were created"; this project eventually became Scott's film Prometheus (2012). On learning that Fox intended to pursue Alien vs. Predator, Cameron believed the film would [...] "kill the validity of the franchise" [...] and ceased work on his story, [...] "To me, that was Frankenstein Meets Werewolf. It was Universal <b>just</b> <b>taking</b> their assets and starting to play them off against each other...Milking it." [...] After viewing Alien vs. Predator, however, Cameron remarked that [...] "it was actually pretty good. I think of the five Alien films, I'd rate it third. I actually liked it. I actually liked it a lot." [...] Conversely, Ridley Scott had no interest in the Alien vs. Predator films. When asked in May 2012 if he had watched them, Scott laughed, [...] "No. I couldn't do that. I couldn't quite take that step."

[...] Cameron has spoken extensively with the media about the film's environmental message, saying that he envisioned Avatar as a broader metaphor of how we treat the natural world. [...] He said that he created Pandora as [...] "a fictionalised fantasy version of what our world was like, before we started to pave it and build malls, and shopping centers.

[...] Interviewed by Terry Gross of National Public Radio, he called Avatar a satire on the sense of human entitlement: [...] " [...] is saying our attitude about indigenous people and our entitlement about what is rightfully theirs is the same sense of entitlement that lets us bulldoze a forest and not blink an eye. It's just human nature that if we can take it, we will. And sometimes we do it in a very naked and imperialistic way, and other times we do it in a very sophisticated way with lots of rationalization—but it's basically the same thing.
