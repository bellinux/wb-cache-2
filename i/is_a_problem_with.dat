Microsoft is responding to such incidents by restricting access to the account for 25 days whilst the fraud team investigates.

In the validation cohort, the BISAP score had similar test performance characteristics for predicting mortality as the APACHE II score. As <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> {{many of the other}} scoring systems, the BISAP has not been validated for predicting outcomes such as length of hospital stay, need for ICU care, or need for intervention.|$|E

500|$|Moreover, the allographs {{detected}} by Pozdniakov are given different readings by Fedorova, so that, for example, otherwise parallel texts repeatedly substitute the purported verb [...] "take" [...] for the purported noun [...] "a kind of yam". (Pozdniakov {{has demonstrated that}} these are graphic variants of the same glyph.) As it was, Fedorova's catalog consisted of 130 glyphs; Pozdniakov's additional allography would have made her interpretation even more repetitive. Such extreme repetition <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> all attempts to read rongorongo as a logographic script.|$|E

500|$|Approximately {{ten days}} after the forced {{abortion}} occurred, the Shaanxi Provincial Population and Family Planning Commission launched an investigation. [...] On June 13, Yu Yanmei, the deputy head of Ankang, visited the Deng household. [...] Two days later, the commission concluded that Feng had indeed been forced into an illegal abortion, writing, [...] "Such practice has seriously violated the relevant policies... harmed the image of our family planning work, and caused extremely poor effects in society." [...] Three officials, including {{the head of the}} local family-planning department, were suspended from their jobs on June 14.

The Taunton bypass section of M5, from J25-26, opened in April 1974, relieving the town of heavy holiday traffic on the A38. Taunton Deane services are located between junctions 25 and 26 on the M5. However, with the flourishing local economy, traffic <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> Somerset County Council giving a prediction of a significant increase based on 2001 levels. Two major new road have been undertaken since 2010.

[...] In its review of True Blue, Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that [...] "she is using the music to hook in critics just as she's baiting a mass audience with such masterstrokes as 'Papa Don't Preach'." [...] Robert Christgau in a review for The Village Voice felt that [...] "she [...] doesn't speak for the ordinary teenaged stiff any more", adding that the [...] "antiabortion content of 'Papa Don't Preach' isn't unequivocal, and wouldn't make the song bad by definition if it were, the ambiguity is a cop-out rather than an open door, which is bad." ...|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the pilot episode, Rachel is dumped by her boyfriend Simon Atkinson (Stephen Mapes), who has recently taken a job in Hong Kong and does not want to [...] "burden" [...] Rachel with deciding whether to emigrate with him. Shortly afterwards, her car collides with that of Adam Williams on a supermarket car park. The two get into a row over whose fault the crash was and he smoothes things over by giving him her phone number, ostensibly in case there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> the insurance. She writes her number in the muck on his rear windscreen but it later washes off in the rain. Some time later, Rachel's friend Karen advises her to call Adam and go on a date with him. Their first date does not go well, but they see each other again. Three months later, they row, and Rachel gets back together with Simon, who has returned to Hong Kong. Adam wins her back by serenading her while wearing nothing but a rose between his buttocks.|$|E
500|$|Joey {{returns to}} his {{apartment}} to fetch the chick and the duck he was hiding, but finds they have become trapped in the foosball table. Chandler and Joey decide to break it open when they cannot find any other way of getting the birds out. Phoebe's reckless driving gets her and Ross to JFK Airport and, after buying a ticket to get past security, they search the information boards for Rachel's flight number. When they cannot locate her flight {{on any of the}} information boards, Ross calls and checks the number with Monica but discovers they are at the wrong airport; Ross and Phoebe drove to JFK, while Rachel was flying out of nearby Newark Airport. Phoebe phones Rachel, who has already boarded her flight, to stall her for time. When a passenger (Jim Rash) overhears Phoebe saying there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> the fictitious [...] "left phalange" [...] of the plane, he gets off the plane, prompting everyone else to leave. Chandler and Joey, who are emotionally attached to the foosball table, find they are unable to bear breaking it open, so Monica nonchalantly offers to do it for them. After they retrieve the birds, Chandler suggests Joey keeps them.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{some of the}} {{population}} of male gamers have been the source of harassment towards female gamers and over-sexualization of the characters, there are many men in the gaming industry who agree that there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> female over-sexualization in gaming. There are also male gamers who argue that some of the sexualization of women in video games also applies to men in video games and that portraying a man or woman in a video game in a sexual way can be acceptable if done in the right context. [...] Perceptions about stereotypes concerning gamers themselves also vary among genders, as well as playing frequency of game genres. A study in the Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media said that women who play a lot of video games disagree more with stereotypes concerning gender in gaming and are more strongly drawn towards specific gaming genres than men, regardless of the men's gaming frequency.|$|E
