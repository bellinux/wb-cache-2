5|$|After {{the end of}} {{the promotional}} period, Burger King {{received}} numerous complaints from fans of Chicken Fries through social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook. One of the major ways the company responded was through personalized responses to these posts. Instead of using an automated response that would paste a standardized message on people's Twitter feeds, the company instead employed several staff to personally respond to customers voicing displeasure on the LTO nature of the 2014 introduction. The entire 2014 Chicken Fries promotion represented a major shift in the attitude towards advertising for Burger King, moving from a more traditional advertising structure to one focused almost entirely on digitally-based media. This change happened fairly quickly, falling into place over the twelve to eighteen-month period preceding the reintroduction of Chicken Fries to the chain's menu. Along with the new advertising firm, a new director of <b>digital</b> <b>marketing</b> and social media was newly hired from cosmetics firm L'Oréal was added, increasing the clout of the digital advertising team within the chain.|$|E

Continued business strategy change saw further departures from Head Office in brand communication and PR and a renewed agency contract for Waterstones’ <b>digital</b> <b>marketing</b> with Epiphany. The retailer overhauled its business technology with new algorithms on its website to help personalise the online shopping experience, updated point-of-sale IT and by introducing contactless payment in its stores. The retailer partnered with Airbnb to hold a one-off ‘sleepover’ for customers in its Piccadilly branch in October 2014 after a customer was accidentally trapped in the Trafalgar Square branch after closing. Accounts for 2014 saw operating income losses narrow to £3.8 million, but sales slip by 5.9%.|$|E

Marketing scholars and strategists are aware of the <b>digital</b> <b>market’s</b> unique properties, but require planning frameworks with conceptual validity and commercial value. The proposed mind/time sharing model combines seminal consumer resource exchange theory, pioneering information science and media stu-dies, classic examinations of societal transformation, as well as literature chronicling the emergence of <b>digital</b> <b>market</b> consumption during the World Wide Web’s inception. The resulting model contributes a sound theoretical template which can be applied by <b>digital</b> consumer <b>market</b> providers for systematic strategic planning...|$|R

With the help of his musician friend Taufiq Qureshi, he launched a live-action trailer film on YouTube and built an online community in Facebook and Twitter, surrounding the video, to further hold the reader's interest.|$|E
