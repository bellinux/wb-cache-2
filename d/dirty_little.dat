25|$|The Official Story can be {{considered}} alongside a group of other films that {{were the first to}} be made in Argentina after the downfall in 1983 of the last Argentine dictator, General Galtieri, and his autocratic regime. These films deal frankly with the repression, the torture, and the disappearances during Argentina's Dirty War in the 1970s and early 1980s; they include Funny <b>Dirty</b> <b>Little</b> War (1983) and Night of the Pencils (1986). A second group of films, which includes Verónico Cruz (1988) uses metaphor and hints at wider socio-political issues.|$|E

500|$|The {{theme of}} {{opposition}} to the war that pervades the show is unified by the plot thread that progresses through the book – Claude's moral dilemma over whether to burn his draft card. Pacifism is explored throughout the extended trip sequence in Act 2. [...] The lyrics to [...] "Three-Five-Zero-Zero", which is sung during that sequence, evoke the horrors of war ("ripped open by metal explosion"). [...] The song is based on Allen Ginsberg's 1966 poem, [...] "Wichita Vortex Sutra". [...] In the poem, General Maxwell Taylor proudly reports to the press the number of enemy soldiers killed in one month, repeating it digit by digit, for effect: [...] "Three-Five-Zero-Zero." [...] The song begins with images of death and dying and turns into a manic dance number, echoing Maxwell's glee at reporting the enemy casualties, as the tribe chants [...] "Take weapons up and begin to kill". [...] The song also includes the repeated phrase [...] "Prisoners in niggertown/ It's a <b>dirty</b> <b>little</b> war".|$|E

500|$|The {{relationship}} between Chamberlain and Lloyd George was thenceforth one of hatred, with Chamberlain calling Lloyd George [...] "that <b>dirty</b> <b>little</b> Welsh Attorney" [...] and being implacably opposed to Lloyd George joining the National Government in the 1930s. Austen Chamberlain, {{the brother of}} one opponent and, for a time, the political ally of the other, regretted the enmity, [...] "More's the pity, for together if they were together they might do a great deal." [...] Lloyd George would later paint a most unflattering portrait of Chamberlain in his 1935 War Memoirs, claiming that “Mr Chamberlain {{is a man of}} rigid competency. Such men have their uses in conventional times … and are indispensable for filling subordinate posts at all times. But they are lost in an emergency or in creative tasks at any time.” HIs dislike of Chamberlain is sometimes said to have been based on phrenology, although little contemporary evidence has been found to confirm this. Lloyd George would also have the last laugh in May 1940, when his speech in the Norway Debate helped bring down Chamberlain’s government.|$|E
500|$|Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore: Goldfinger's {{personal}} {{pilot and}} leader of an all-female team of pilots known as Pussy Galore's Flying Circus. Blackman was selected {{for the role of}} Pussy Galore because of her role in The Avengers and the script was rewritten to show Blackman's judo abilities. The character's name follows in the tradition of other Bond girls names that are double entendres. Concerned about censors, the producers thought about changing the character's name to [...] "Kitty Galore", but they and Hamilton decided [...] "if you were a ten-year old boy and knew what the name meant, you weren't a ten-year old boy, you were a <b>dirty</b> <b>little</b> bitch. The American censor was concerned, but we got round that by inviting him and his wife out to dinner and [...] we were big supporters of the Republican Party." [...] During promotion, Blackman took delight in embarrassing interviewers by repeatedly mentioning the character's name. Whilst the American censors did not interfere with the name in the film, they refused to allow the name [...] "Pussy Galore" [...] to appear on promotional materials and for the US market she was subsequently called [...] "Miss Galore" [...] or [...] "Goldfinger's personal pilot".|$|E
500|$|... "Outrageous" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Mim Udovitch of Blender called the song an [...] "R. Kelly club number, [...] has a hot, odd compulsion and lyrics that are practically big-pimpin', Spears-style". William Shaw of Blender selected {{it as the}} ninth best Spears song, highlighting [...] "the nonsense chants" [...] at 1:10. While reviewing , Ann Powers commented, [...] "'Outrageous' is R. Kelly's <b>dirty</b> <b>little</b> take on the ideal Janet Jackson song". Spence D. of IGN said of the song that [...] "it's a somewhat derivative Egyptian lover groove number. Yet for all [...] repetitiveness, it's still kind of funky and pervasive". Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times called it [...] " [...] composition that cruises along on autopilot for two minutes and then suddenly switches gears with a delectable Michael Jackson-inspired bridge". Annabel Leathes of BBC Online stated that [...] "R. Kelly transform Britney into a grubby Beyoncé". Caryn Ganz of Spin called [...] "Outrageous" [...] a [...] "go-nowhere homage to living fabulously". Dave de Sylvia of Sputnikmusic called it [...] "a forgettable but nonetheless catchy single". David Browne of Entertainment Weekly said that along with [...] "(I Got That) Boom Boom", [...] " [...] {{are little more than}} wobbly, rhythm-based contraptions intended to advance Spears' sex-princess-on-the-loose image". Jamie Gill of Yahoo! Music Radio commented that, [...] "with its cheap, tinny production– it would take a rather senile and unworldly old lady in Tonbridge Wells [...] to find this even diverting, let alone shocking".|$|E

[...] SuChin Pak, also from MTV stated the show was [...] "no huge revelation", explaining, [...] "It {{was not the kind of}} show that says: 'She's back. She's going to come out with the biggest album of her career.' Nor did it say that she's lost forever and we'll never see the old Britney back again. These are all really tiny baby steps." [...] Thomas K. Arnold of USA Today said the show [...] "turned out to be more rehearsal than comeback", although [...] "all those post-rehab workouts were worth the effort." [...] On May 2, 2007, scalpers outside the House of Blues in San Diego were selling tickets with a face value of $35 for prices between $200 and $500. Chris Lee of the Los Angeles Times wrote that [...] "her 'comeback'– if you want to call it that– cemented Spears' place as pop music's reigning drama queen, capable of capturing worldwide tabloid headlines with a bare minimum of creative expenditure." ...|$|E
