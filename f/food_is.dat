5|$|Although Jersey {{does not}} have VAT, the States of Jersey {{introduced}} a goods and services tax (GST) on 6 May 2008, at a standard rate of 3%. The rate was amended to 5% on 1 June 2011. Although GST is at 5%, shopping in Jersey is still far more expensive than in the UK. <b>Food</b> <b>is</b> not exempt, unlike with VAT.|$|E
5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the kakapo's {{breeding}} system is that a female can alter the sex ratio of her offspring depending on her condition. A female who eats protein-rich foods produces more male offspring (males have 30%–40% more body weight than females). Females produce offspring biased towards the dispersive sex when competition for resources (such as <b>food)</b> <b>is</b> high and towards the non-dispersive sex when <b>food</b> <b>is</b> plentiful. A female kakapo will likely {{be able to produce}} eggs even when there are few resources, while a male kakapo will be more capable of perpetuating the species when there are plenty, by mating with several females. This supports the Trivers–Willard hypothesis. The relationship between clutch sex ratio and maternal diet has conservation implications, because a captive population maintained on a high quality diet will produce fewer females and therefore fewer individuals valuable to the recovery of the species.|$|E
50|$|The term health <b>food</b> has <b>been</b> {{used since}} the 1920s {{to refer to}} {{specific}} <b>foods</b> claimed to <b>be</b> especially beneficial to health, although the term has no official definition. Some terms {{that are associated with}} health <b>food</b> <b>are</b> macrobiotics, natural <b>foods,</b> organic foods and whole <b>foods.</b> Macrobiotics <b>is</b> a diet focusing primarily on whole cereals. Whole cereals, along with other whole <b>foods,</b> <b>are</b> <b>foods</b> that <b>are</b> minimally processed. Whole cereals have their fiber, germ and hull intact and are considered more nutritious. Natural <b>foods</b> <b>are</b> simply <b>foods</b> that contain no artificial ingredients. Organic <b>foods</b> <b>are</b> <b>foods</b> that <b>are</b> grown without the use of conventional and artificial pesticides and must meet certain organic standards.|$|R

They roost communally, like other Elanus species.|$|E
5|$|Digestion {{starts in}} buccal cavity (mouth) as {{partially}} chewed <b>food</b> <b>is</b> {{broken down by}} saliva from the salivary glands. As the salivary glands produce fluid and carbohydrate-digesting enzymes (mostly amylases), strong muscles in the pharynx pump fluid into the buccal cavity, lubricating the food like the salivarium does, and helping blood feeders, and xylem and phloem feeders.|$|E
5|$|<b>Food</b> <b>is</b> {{ingested}} {{through the}} mouth and when swallowed passes first into the pharynx {{and then into the}} esophagus. The esophagus is thus one of the first components of the digestive system and the gastrointestinal tract. After food passes through the esophagus, it enters the stomach. When <b>food</b> <b>is</b> being swallowed, the epiglottis moves backward to cover the larynx, preventing food from entering the trachea. At the same time, the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes, allowing a bolus of food to enter. Peristaltic contractions of the esophageal muscle push the food down the esophagus. These rhythmic contractions occur both as a reflex response to food that is in the mouth, and also {{as a response to the}} sensation of food within the esophagus itself. Along with peristalsis, the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes.|$|E

5|$|Plant <b>food</b> <b>is</b> stored year-round, {{but mainly}} in autumn. Individual seeds are hidden in cracks in bark, {{occasionally}} in walls {{or in the}} ground. The food item is usually concealed with lichen, moss or small pieces of bark. The cached <b>food</b> <b>is</b> retrieved in cold weather. Siberian birds store {{the seeds of the}} Siberian stone pine, sometimes hoarding enough to last a whole year. Cached food may sometimes include non-plant material such as pieces of bread, caterpillars and grubs, the larvae being incapacitated by battering. Hoarding is a long-term strategy, stored food items only being consumed when fresh <b>food</b> <b>is</b> hard to find, sometimes up to three months after caching. Birds with good stored food supplies are fitter that those with more limited resources. Beech mast crops vary widely from year to year. Where beech mast {{is an important part of}} the diet, adult survival rates are largely unaffected in years with a poor mast crop, but the number of juvenile birds falls in the autumn as they are lost through starvation or emigration. In areas where common hazel is the prevalent tree species, there is a similar pattern of adult survival and loss of juvenile birds in years with poor nut production.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{show that}} scaly-breasted munias tend {{to adopt the}} scrounger tactic when <b>food</b> <b>is</b> more clumped and when the group size increases. When most foragers adopt scrounging, the time taken to {{discover}} new food patches is greater.|$|E
5|$|The {{barn owl}} hunts by flying slowly, {{quartering}} {{the ground and}} hovering over spots that may conceal prey. It may also use branches, fence posts or other lookouts to scan its surroundings, {{and this is the}} main means of prey location in the oil palm plantations of Malaysia. The bird has long, broad wings, enabling it to manoeuvre and turn abruptly. Its legs and toes are long and slender which improves its ability to forage among dense foliage or beneath the snow and gives it a wide spread of talons when attacking prey. Studies have shown that an individual barn owl may eat one or more voles (or their equivalent) per night, equivalent to about twenty-three percent of the bird's bodyweight. Excess <b>food</b> <b>is</b> often cached at roosting sites and can be used when <b>food</b> <b>is</b> scarce.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the ancient}} Vedic period (between 1500 BC and 500 BC), {{although}} the laws allowed {{the consumption of}} some kinds of meat, vegetarianism was encouraged. The Manusmriti law book states, [...] "There is no sin in eating meat... but abstention brings great rewards." [...] According to Veda, <b>food</b> <b>was</b> not just a means of sustenance but your choice of diet determined your social status. <b>Food</b> <b>was</b> equated with wealth because {{a person who had}} an unending access to <b>food</b> <b>was</b> a successful person. Consuming <b>food</b> <b>was</b> also considered an act of dominance or of wielding power over that food.|$|R

5|$|The {{esophagus}} {{is surrounded}} {{at the top}} and bottom by two muscular rings, known respectively as the upper esophageal sphincter and the lower esophageal sphincter.
