In the first place captains were given some leeway by allowing them {{a certain percentage of}} missing troops, without consequences for their payment.

500|$|The bad rockmen and rubbish {{men were}} usually {{paid by the}} ton of {{material}} removed, but the quarrymen were paid according to a more complicated system. Part of the payment {{was determined by the}} number of slates the gang produced, but this could vary greatly according {{to the nature of the}} rock in the section allocated to them. The men would therefore be paid an extra sum of [...] "poundage" [...] per pound's worth of slate produced. [...] "Bargains" [...] were let by the setting steward, who would agree a price for a certain area of rock. If the rock <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bargain</b> allocated to a gang was poor, they would be paid a higher poundage, while good rock meant a lower poundage.

The Portuguese were unlikely to go to war over the islands encountered by Columbus, but the explicit mention of India was a major issue.

In contrast to most existing models, our approach accounts for heterogeneous skill groups which differ in terms of productivity and representation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bargaining</b> process through union preferences.

Estimates of structural parameters are obtained from a novel crosssection of German firms of the business related service sector which includes information on skill-specific wage rates at the firm level.
