500|$|In the Re-Invention World Tour of 2004, Madonna {{included}} the song {{at the start}} of the final segment, which started with Scottish bagpiper players parading around the stage in kilts and playing drums and pipes. Madonna appeared onstage in similar long kilts and a white sleeveless T-shirt to perform [...] "Into the Groove" [...] with Scottish bagpiper group Lorne Cousin. Rapper Missy Elliott appeared on the video screen for a rap interlude. The song was again added to the setlist of 2008–09 Sticky & Sweet Tour. Elements of Cassius's [...] "Toop Toop", Frankie Smith's [...] "Double Dutch Bus", The Sugarhill Gang's [...] "" [...] and Madonna's own [...] "Jump" [...] were added to the performance. [...] "Into the Groove" [...] marked the beginning of the second segment titled Old School. It began with Madonna appearing on the stage <b>in</b> <b>shorts</b> <b>and</b> T-shirt, while skipping to a DJ station. She started singing the song while cartoon characters from late artist, and Madonna's friend, Keith Haring dance on the backdrops. Near the end of the song, Madonna performed a Double Dutch dance interlude.|$|E
500|$|The video {{features}} appearances by Beyoncé's sister Solange Knowles, {{her background}} dancers, including French dancing duo Les Twins, and her all-female band. Houston-located rapper Nosaprise {{also makes a}} cameo appearance. The video opens with Beyoncé and her sister riding lowrider bicycles, getting to a roller rink where several people are already gathered. Shots of people roler-skating inside the rink with disco balls {{hanging from the ceiling}} follow. The singer is then seen performing a dance with several background dancers as they hold rollers in their hands and enter a place called [...] "Roller City USA". Beyoncé starts skating and performing dance moves in slow-motion with several of her dancers dressed <b>in</b> <b>shorts</b> <b>and</b> T-shirts. Several scenes which are shot in bright black light follow as Beyoncé performs another dance sequence along with her dancers on their rollers. The second, more uptempo part of the song starts and the singer is seen arriving with a vehicle in front of a place called [...] "Cherry". She dances atop the car and dances with her background band as they play the song on their keytars. As the song progresses, smoke starts appearing {{out of the car and}} on the scene where she is with her band. During the end of the video, Beyoncé and her sister are seen going away on the same path by which they came. Close-up shots of Beyoncé lip-syncing the song are intertwined in the video with her lips covered with a shiny lipstick.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Vida" [...] was filmed in Rio de Janeiro and was {{directed}} by Kátia Lund and Lívia Gama of Bossa Nova Films. According to Lund, [...] "The lyrics and the emotion that {{are reflected in the}} video for [...] "Vida" [...] inspire a celebration of life, {{in a way that is}} pure and simple: the sun, coming together and the energy." [...] She said that the visual is about life in which differences are celebrated and appreciated easily and with happiness and claimed that was the reason Martin [...] "just wanted it to be natural" [...] and to differ from what he had done before with choreography, big sets and directed scenes. Martin also commented the shooting process, [...] "It's an incredible feeling to have had the opportunity to participate in a global initiative like SuperSong. I'm very excited to finally be able to sing 'Vida' and share this special song with the world." [...] On April 21, Martin released a teaser from the video on his official social networks, while the full video premiered on his Vevo channel on YouTube the next day. It features the singer relaxing <b>in</b> <b>shorts</b> <b>and</b> a tank-top while he sings on the beaches of Rio de Janeiro. The video also contains around 100 extras including kids, samba dancers, models and others intended to represent the diversity of the Brazilian nation. Wass of Idolator praised the video, writing that Martin [...] "looks great" [...] in it and mentioned the Brazilian scenery was [...] "pretty awesome".|$|E

2500|$|In 2006 Panahi made Offside. In the film, a {{group of}} young Iranian girls {{disguise}} themselves as boys to sneak into Azadi Stadium to watch the World Cup qualifying football playoff game between Iran and Bahrain. The film was partially shot during the actual game it depicts. Since the 1979 Islamic Revolution women have been banned from attending football matches in Iran on grounds of rowdy and aggressive language, lewd behavior, and seeing men <b>in</b> <b>shorts</b> <b>and</b> short sleeve shirts. At one point Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had wanted to repeal the law but was overruled by the ulema. Panahi has stated [...] "I use the football game as a metaphor to show the discrimination against women on a larger scale. All my movies have that topic at their center. This is what I am trying to change in Iranian society." [...] The film was inspired by an incident several years earlier when Panahi's daughter was refused entry to a football stadium but ended up sneaking into the stadium anyway.|$|E
2500|$|Also in 2012, Friend Request Pending, an indie {{short film}} which Dench had filmed in 2011, {{received}} a wide release {{as part of}} the feature films Stars <b>in</b> <b>Shorts</b> <b>and</b> The Joy of Six. In the 12-minute comedy, directed by My Week with Marilyn assistant director Chris Foggin on a budget of just £5,000, she portrays a pensioner grappling with a crush on her church choirmaster and the art of cyber-flirting via social networking. Dench made her seventh and final appearance as M in the twenty-third James Bond film, Skyfall (2012), directed by Sam Mendes. In the film, Bond investigates an attack on MI6; it transpires that it is part of an attack on M by former MI6 operative, Raoul Silva (played by Javier Bardem) to humiliate, discredit and kill M as revenge against her for betraying him. Dench's position as M was subsequently filled by Ralph Fiennes' character. Coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the James Bond series, Skyfall was positively received by critics and at the box office, grossing over $1billion worldwide, and became the highest-grossing film of all-time in the UK and the highest-grossing film in the James Bond series. Critics called Dench's Saturn Awards-nominated performance [...] "compellingly luminous".|$|E

Eventually, 15 Britannias were completed by Shorts; five sets of Britannia components were sent to Filton and used on the continued production there of Britannias.|$|E

Mennox is taken off guard by this, and Franklin (who has held a grudge against him for belittling Bernard, his hero, in the past), slyly remarks {{that they would be}} stuck together, in this awkward situation (on Mennox's part), for the duration of a very long flight.|$|E

30|$|In this section, {{we first}} {{investigate}} {{the effectiveness of}} several key issues for the proposed approach, i.e., the quantization error estimation for shifted JPEG compression, the primary quality factor estimation, and the proposed discriminative feature for SDJPEG detection. Then, we analyze the SDJPEG detection performance for image patches of various sizes and compared the detection performance with four state-of-the-art SDJPEG detection algorithms, i.e., Luo et al.'s [15] (Luo's <b>in</b> <b>short),</b> Chen <b>and</b> Hsu's [16] (Chen's <b>in</b> <b>short),</b> Bianchi <b>and</b> Piva's [13] (Bianchi I's <b>in</b> <b>short),</b> <b>and</b> Bianchi and Piva's [14] (Bianchi II's <b>in</b> <b>short).</b> Finally, we compare the image tampering detection performance of all five algorithms for two example images. The images in our experiments come from two widely used image databases, i.e., the UCID [25] and NRCS [26] image datasets, and all the original images are uncompressed.|$|R
