5|$|Holometabolism, or {{complete}} metamorphosis, {{is where the}} insect changes in four stages, an egg or embryo, a larva, a pupa and the adult or imago. In these species, an egg hatches to produce a larva, which is generally worm-like in form. This worm-like form {{can be one of}} several varieties: <b>eruciform</b> (caterpillar-like), scarabaeiform (grub-like), campodeiform (elongated, flattened and active), elateriform (wireworm-like) or vermiform (maggot-like). The larva grows and eventually becomes a pupa, a stage marked by reduced movement and often sealed within a cocoon. There are three types of pupae: obtect, exarate or coarctate. Obtect pupae are compact, with the legs and other appendages enclosed. Exarate pupae have their legs and other appendages free and extended. Coarctate pupae develop inside the larval skin. Insects undergo considerable change in form during the pupal stage, and emerge as adults. Butterflies are a well-known example of insects that undergo complete metamorphosis, although most insects use this life cycle. Some insects have evolved this system to hypermetamorphosis.|$|E
25|$|As {{with most}} common names, the {{application}} of the word is arbitrary and the larvae of sawflies commonly are called caterpillars as well. Both lepidopteran and symphytan larvae have <b>eruciform</b> body shapes.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>eruciform</b> (caterpillar-like, {{as in the}} Lepidoptera and Symphyta. Some {{that lack}} legs, such as the larvae of Nematoceran flies such as mosquitoes, are called apodous <b>eruciform),</b> ...|$|E
50|$|The {{suborder}} Symphyta {{includes the}} sawflies, horntails, and parasitic wood wasps. The group may be paraphyletic, {{as it has}} been suggested that the family Orussidae may be the group from which the Apocrita arose. They have an unconstricted junction between the thorax and abdomen. The larvae are herbivorous, free-living <b>eruciforms,</b> with three pairs of true legs, prolegs (on every segment, unlike Lepidoptera) and ocelli. The prolegs do not have crochet hooks at the ends unlike the larvae of the Lepidoptera.|$|R
40|$|I {{reject the}} Darwinian {{assumption}} that larvae and their adults {{evolved from a}} single common ancestor. Rather I posit that, in animals that metamorphose, the basic types of larvae originated as adults of different lineages, i. e., larvae were transferred when, through hybridization, their genomes were acquired by distantly related animals. “Caterpillars,” the name for <b>eruciforms</b> with thoracic and abdominal legs, are larvae of lepidopterans, hymenopterans, and mecopterans (scorpionflies). Grubs and maggots, including the larvae of beetles, bees, and flies, evolved from caterpillars by loss of legs. Caterpillar larval organs are dismantled and reconstructed in the pupal phase. Such indirect developmental patterns (metamorphoses) did not originate solely by accumulation of random mutations followed by natural selection; rather they are fully consistent with my concept of evolution by hybridogenesis. Members of the phylum Onychophora (velvet worms) are proposed as the evolutionary source of caterpillars and their grub or maggot descendants. I present a molecular biological research proposal to test my thesis. By my hypothesis 2 recognizable sets of genes are detectable in the genomes of all insects with caterpillar grub- or maggot-like larvae: (i) onychophoran genes that code for proteins determining larval morphology/physiology and (ii) sequentially expressed insect genes that code for adult proteins. The genomes of insects and other animals that, by contrast, entirely lack larvae comprise recognizable sets of genes from single animal common ancestors...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Eruciform</b> (literally: [...] "caterpillar-shaped") is the entomological term {{describing}} a certain class of shapes of insect larvae.|$|E
5000|$|Arguably {{the most}} {{typically}} <b>eruciform</b> larvae, prolegs and all, {{are to be}} found among the butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera), caddis larvae (Trichoptera), and sawflies (Symphyta) ...|$|E
50|$|Polypod larvae - {{also known}} as <b>eruciform</b> larvae, these larva have {{abdominal}} prolegs, in addition to usual thoracic legs. They poorly sclerotized and relatively inactive. They live {{in close contact with}} the food. Best example is caterpillars of lepidopterans.|$|E
5000|$|One {{should not}} take the [...] "caterpillar-shaped" [...] {{description}} too seriously; there are many shapes of caterpillars besides the typical silkworm larva, and insect larvae of many shapes, not obviously caterpillar-like, are described as <b>eruciform.</b> Some, for example, are in fact shaped like certain other, straight, <b>eruciform</b> larvae, except that they are curved into a C-shape. These are called [...] "scarabaeiform" [...] {{because it is the}} typical form of the larvae of the Scarabaeidae—the scarab beetles and their relatives. In contrast, larvae of the Curculionidae — the weevils — are also called [...] "apodous eruciform", (literally meaning legless caterpillar-shaped; unlike scarab larvae, they do not have legs). This seems rather inconsistent, because commonly weevil larvae are almost as C-shaped as scarab larvae.|$|E
50|$|The larvae of H. apicalis is <b>eruciform</b> with a sclerotized {{head and}} segmented, yet soft, body. The {{abdominal}} segments have prolegs. The larval eyes {{are composed of}} 7 ommatidia. The larvae are saprophagous and have been seen to feed on dead insects in the field. The fourth instar larva prepares a burrow in which pupation occurs. H. apicalis pupae are exarate and morphologically similar to the adults with the wings folded tightly against the body.|$|E
5000|$|Some larvae, such {{as those}} of most beetles in the family Chrysomelidae, are {{described}} as <b>eruciform,</b> although they are short, have swollen abdomens, and have no true [...] "prolegs" [...] such as caterpillars have. Typically they walk freely on leaves and similar surfaces, using the [...] "true" [...] six legs on the three thoracic segments just behind the head. The abdomen is carried behind as a more or less swollen, hump-backed rear end.|$|E
50|$|The {{adults are}} usually brown in colour, often with narrow mottled or {{patterned}} forewings and much broader, transparent hindwings. The aquatic larvae construct portable cases {{from a wide}} variety of plant and mineral materials, sometimes even snail shells. Cases of young larvae often looking completely different from those of larger instars. Larvae tend to be <b>eruciform</b> (with a thickset head and thorax), rather slow-moving, and usually feed by browsing algae or scavenging animal remains. They pupate within the larval case, the pupa swimming to the surface before flying away as an adult. For most species the life cycle is completed within one year.|$|E
50|$|Nannochoristidae is {{a family}} of scorpionflies with many unusual traits. It is a tiny, relict family of about eight species, {{with members of the}} genus Nannochorista {{occurring}} in New Zealand, southeastern Australia, Tasmania, and Chile, so is probably of Gondwanan origin. The adults look like scorpionflies with more pointed, elongated wings. Most mecopteran larvae are <b>eruciform,</b> or shaped like caterpillars. Nannochoristid larvae, however, are elateriform, or shaped like wireworm or click beetle larvae. They are also the only entirely aquatic Mecoptera. Wing venation suggests a close relationship to dipterans. They are predatory, primarily on the larvae of aquatic Diptera.|$|E
5000|$|Larvae (maggots) of {{most members}} of this family are parasitoids (developing inside a living host, {{ultimately}} killing it). In contrast a few are parasitic (not generally killing the host). Tachinid larvae feed on the host tissues, either after having been injected into the host by the parent, or penetrating the host from outside. Various species have different modes of oviposition and of host invasion. Typically, Tachinid larvae are endoparasites (internal parasites) of caterpillars of butterflies and moths, or the <b>eruciform</b> larvae of sawflies, but some species attack adult beetles and some attack beetle larvae. Others attack various types of true bugs, and others attack grasshoppers; a few even attack centipedes. Also parasitised are bees, wasps and sawflies.|$|E

40|$|Immatures of the Phelypera schuppeli (Boheman, 1834) (Curculionidae; Hyperinae; Cepurini) are described, {{illustrated}} {{and compared}} with available descriptions of larvae and pupae of Hyperini. Immatures and adults from midwest (Dourados, Mato Grosso do Sul; Pirenopolis, Goias) and southeast Brazil (Bauru, Sao Paulo) {{were found on}} leaves of the host plant, Pachira aquatica Aubl. (Malvaceae, formerly Bombacaceae), a tree used as an ornamental plant in many Brazilian frost-free cities. Larvae of P. schuppeli are exophytic, brightly colored, <b>eruciform</b> and possess abdominal ambulatory ampullae, resembling larvae of Lepidoptera. Mature larvae can spin globular lattice-like cocoons where pupation takes place. Data {{in the field and}} under laboratory conditions confirmed previously published biological observations on P. schuppeli. Additional information about defensive behaviors, process of cocoon construction and natural enemies, such as the larval predator Supputius cinticeps (Stal, 1860) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) and the prepupal and pupal parasitoid Jaliscoa nudipennis Boucek, 1993 (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), are reported...|$|E
40|$|Loxandrus oophagus sp. nov. is {{described}} (type-locality: Uberlandia, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil). Larvae, pupae and adults {{of the new}} species of the carabid beetle were collected on foam nests of the anuran Leptodactylus fuscus (Schneider, 1799) in the surroundings of Uberlandia, 18 degrees 55 S, 48 degrees 17 W (Brazil, Minas Gerais), at 750 m altitude. The new species is compared with the similar Loxandrus quinarius Will & Liebherr, 1997, only known from Santa Cruz, Bolivia, differing by the morphology of tarsomeres. Larvae prey on anuran eggs. Description of the immatures and {{the natural history of}} the species are provided. The larva differs from the known larvae of Loxandrus species mainly by being <b>eruciform,</b> glabrous and depigmented, its small head and legs, and the lack of stemmata and urogomphi, representing an unusual last instar type among the Carabidae.
