5|$|Fowler {{concluded}} the trial period at Blackburn {{by agreeing to}} a three-month pay-as-you-play deal. He stated that {{he was eager to}} return to the Premier League and that his pre-existing relationship with Ince would not earn <b>him</b> <b>any</b> preferential treatment. He made his first appearance against Everton in a 1–0 win in the League Cup on 24 September. With a month left on his contract at Blackburn, Fowler received interest from League Two side Grimsby Town. Fowler, a noted friend of then Grimsby manager Mike Newell had held talks at Blundell Park over a possible Player/Coach role with the club.|$|E
5|$|Gian Gastone {{arrived in}} Tuscany, without his wife, in 1708. The Emperor, {{thinking}} {{it unlikely that}} any male heirs were to be born to the Medici, prepared to occupy Tuscany, under the pretext of Medici descent. He intimated that upon the Grand Prince's death the Tuscans would rebel against Cosimo's autocratic government. Cosimo, {{in an act of}} desperation, had Francesco Maria, the Medici family cardinal, renounce his religious vows and marry Eleanor of Gonzaga, the youngest child of the incumbent Duke of Guastalla. Two years later, Francesco Maria died, taking with <b>him</b> <b>any</b> hope of an heir.|$|E
5|$|He {{was born}} in the Saxon duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, to a family {{connected}} to many of Europe's ruling monarchs. At the age of 20, he married his first cousin, Queen Victoria; they had nine children. Initially he felt constrained by his role of consort, which did not afford <b>him</b> <b>any</b> power or responsibilities, but gradually developed a reputation for supporting many public causes, such as educational reform and the abolition of slavery worldwide, and was entrusted with running the Queen's household, office and estates. He was heavily involved with the organisation of the Great Exhibition of 1851, which was a resounding success.|$|E

5|$|In November 1943, Landis agreed {{after some}} persuasion that black sportswriter Sam Lacy {{should make a}} case for {{integration}} of organized baseball before the owners' annual meeting. Instead of Lacy attending the meeting, actor Paul Robeson did. Robeson, though a noted black actor and advocate of civil rights, was a controversial figure due to his affiliation with the Communist Party. The owners heard Robeson out, but at Landis's suggestion, did not ask <b>him</b> <b>any</b> questions or begin any discussion with him.|$|E
5|$|On {{his arrival}} at Alexandria, Cleomenes {{was greeted by}} Ptolemy, who welcomed him with smiles and promises. At first Ptolemy was guarded towards Cleomenes, but soon came to respect him and promised to send him back to Greece with an army and a fleet. He also promised to provide Cleomenes with an annual income of twenty-four talents. However, before he could fulfill his promise, Ptolemy died—and with <b>him</b> <b>any</b> hope for Cleomenes to return to Greece, as the weak Ptolemy IV ascended the throne.|$|E
5|$|Ruth soon {{realized}} that Fuchs had deceived him, and {{had no intention of}} making him manager or giving <b>him</b> <b>any</b> significant off-field duties. He later stated that his only duties as vice president consisted of making public appearances and autographing tickets. Ruth also found out that far from giving him a share of the profits, Fuchs wanted him to invest some of his money in the team in a last-ditch effort to improve its balance sheet. As it turned out, both Fuchs and Ruppert had known all along that Ruth's non-playing positions were meaningless.|$|E

5|$|After {{he became}} Emperor, Zara Yaqob married princess Eleni, who had {{converted}} from Islam before their marriage. Eleni {{was the daughter}} of the king of Hadiya, one of the Sidamo kingdoms south of the Abay River. Although she failed to bear <b>him</b> <b>any</b> children, Eleni grew into a powerful political person. When a conspiracy involving one of his Bitwodeds came to light, Zara Yaqob reacted by appointing his two daughters, Medhan Zamada and Berhan Zamada, to these two offices. According to the Chronicle of his reign, the Emperor also appointed his daughters and nieces as governors over eight of his provinces. These appointments were not successful.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Italian {{dictator}} Benito Mussolini in September 1943, the German Army occupied Athens, where a minority of Greek Jews had sought refuge. The majority (about 60,000 {{out of a total}} population of 75,000) were deported to Nazi concentration camps, where all but 2,000 died. During this period, Princess Andrew hid Jewish widow Rachel Cohen and two of her five children, who sought to evade the Gestapo and deportation to the death camps. Rachel's husband, Haimaki Cohen, had aided King George I of Greece in 1913. In return, King George had offered <b>him</b> <b>any</b> service that he could perform, should Cohen ever need it. Cohen's son remembered this during the Nazi threat, and appealed to Princess Andrew, who with Princess Nicholas was one of only two remaining {{members of the royal family}} left in Greece. She honoured the promise and saved the Cohen family.|$|E
5|$|Despite her {{elevated}} {{rank among}} the royal wives, Ramavo was not the preferred wife of Radama and did not bear <b>him</b> <b>any</b> children. Upon Andrianampoinimerina's death in 1810, Radama succeeded his father as king and followed royal custom by executing a number of potential opponents among Ramavo's relatives, an act that may have strained their relationship. Unable to find satisfaction in her loveless marriage, the neglected Ramavo and other court ladies spent most days socializing and drinking rum with David Griffiths and his fellow missionaries in Griffiths' home. These visits established a deep friendship between Ramavo and Griffiths that would endure for three decades.|$|E

5|$|Guido Forti {{alleged that}} Shannon Racing had not paid <b>him</b> <b>any</b> money within the stipulated six-day {{deadline}} after {{the deal was}} concluded and refuted the claim that it now owned 51% of his team. As the team ran out of money, it was doubtful whether it would turn up at the British GP. In the end, Forti took part, only for the cars to complete a mere handful of laps each in practice and thus failing to set a time quick enough to qualify. This was because it was becoming increasingly in debt to Cosworth and {{was running out of}} engine mileage for its cars, only having enough to make a token effort at participation. The team made it to the next race - the German GP - but both cars remained unassembled in the pit garages throughout the weekend after the engine supply was finally cut off.|$|E
5|$|In 1841, a new Master of the Mint, William Ewart Gladstone was appointed. Gladstone thought {{highly of}} Pistrucci and corresponded {{with him in}} Italian, but was unwilling to grant <b>him</b> <b>any</b> new {{commissions}} while the Waterloo Medal remained outstanding. By 1844, the continued expense of Pistrucci was a concern to the Audit Office. Gladstone restored cuts in Pistrucci's pay {{that had been made}} for failure to train an apprentice, and offered him a bonus of £400 to complete the medal. Pistrucci was to work solely on the one project. He vacated his home at the Royal Mint, moving to Old Windsor, where he set up a workshop to attempt the medal's completion. Although Pistrucci worked constantly on the medal during some periods, he was slowed by a fall in his cottage, which incapacitated him for much of 1846. On 1 January 1849, Pistrucci submitted the matrices of the medal to the Royal Mint, and was paid £1,500.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, Smetana {{had written}} to a friend, the Czech poet Jan Neruda, {{revealing}} fears of the onset of madness. By the winter of 1882–83 he was experiencing depression, insomnia, and hallucinations, together with giddiness, cramp and a temporary loss of speech. In 1883 he began writing a new symphonic suite, Prague Carnival, but could get no further than an Introduction and a Polonaise. He started a new opera, Viola, based on the character in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, but wrote only fragments as his mental state gradually deteriorated. In October 1883 his behaviour at a private reception in Prague disturbed his friends; {{by the middle of}} February 1884 he had ceased to be coherent, and was periodically violent. On 23April his family, unable to nurse <b>him</b> <b>any</b> longer, removed him to the Kateřinky Lunatic Asylum in Prague, where he died on 12May 1884.|$|E

5|$|The {{colony of}} Ubangi-Shari {{received}} its autonomy in 1958 as the Central African Republic and this became independent from France in 1960. In 1970, President Jean-Bédel Bokassa inaugurated the University of Bangui. He established the national airline Air Centrafrique {{the following year}} and ordered the construction of two new luxury hotels in Bangui. With tensions mounting between Bangui and Paris {{as a result of}} Bokassa's uncontrollable expenditures, western banks refused to lend <b>him</b> <b>any</b> more money. Relations with the French worsened still further in April 1974, when Brigette Miroux's body was discovered in a hotel room in Bangui. It was reported in the French media that she had been Bokassa's mistress and that he was responsible for her murder. As a result, Bokassa banned imports of French newspapers and assumed control of the Agence France-Presse office in Bangui. By 1975, Bangui had a population of 300,723.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} the {{investigation}} into Wheldon's death were released on December 15, 2011. In a report prepared by crash investigators, it was found that Wheldon's death was caused by an impact with the catch fencing around the circuit. Brian Barnhart further rejected claims that the banking had also contributed to the accident, stating that it created two ideal racing lines, and that these lines made the location of cars more predictable for other drivers; {{at the time of the}} accident, all 34 cars had been behaving as expected. The report also revealed that the right front pull rod of the suspension assembly penetrated Wheldon's survival cell, though it did not cause <b>him</b> <b>any</b> injury. The report recommended further investigation of this phenomenon, as it was the first recorded incident of its kind in nine years of the use of the IR03 and later IR05 model chassis, which was being retired at the end of the race. The pull-rod suspension chassis is not being utilised in the DW12.|$|E
5|$|To help {{combat the}} {{negative}} press, Aberhart resolved {{to gain control}} of the Albertan, the one paper of note to show <b>him</b> <b>any</b> support. He formed a company that acquired an option to purchase it, and used his radio program to promote the purchase of shares by Social Credit supporters. The other newspapers criticized him for using what was nominally a gospel program to promote stock sales. The plan came to naught, as most Social Credit supporters were too poor to buy newspaper stock, and the only interested buyers were beneficiaries of government patronage, chiefly liquor interests. Even so, the Albertan became the official organ of Social Credit, an editorial decision that doubled its circulation.|$|E

5|$|Two of Rainilaiarivony's cousins {{urged him}} to take his elder brother's place in order to end the shame that Rainivoninahitriniony's {{behavior}} was bringing upon their family. After weighing the idea, Rainilaiarivony approached Rasoherina with the proposal. The queen readily consented and lent her assistance in rallying {{the support of the}} nobles at court. On 14 July 1864, {{little more than a year}} after the coup, Rasoherina deposed and divorced Rainivoninahitriniony, then exiled the fallen minister the following year. Rainilaiarivony was promoted to Prime Minister. The arrangement was sealed when Rainilaiarivony took Rasoherina as his bride and demoted his longtime spouse Rasoanalina to the status of second wife. Rainilaiarivony confided in a friend shortly before his death that he deeply loved his first wife and came to share the same degree of feeling toward Rasoherina as well, but never developed the same affection for the subsequent queens he married. None of his royal spouses bore <b>him</b> <b>any</b> children.|$|E

5|$|Although much of Wang Anshi's reforms {{outlined}} in the New Policies centered on state finance, land tax reform, and the Imperial examinations, there were also military concerns. This included policies of raising militias to lessen the expense of upholding a million soldiers, putting government monopolies on saltpetre and sulphur production and distribution in 1076 (to ensure that gunpowder solutions would not {{fall into the hands}} of enemies), and aggressive military policy towards Song's northern rivals of the Western Xia and Liao dynasties. A few years after Song Dynasty military forces had made victorious territorial gains against the Tanguts of the Western Xia, in 1080 Shen Kuo was entrusted as a military officer in defense of Yanzhou (modern-day Yan'an, Shaanxi province). During the autumn months of 1081, Shen was successful in defending Song Dynasty territory while capturing several fortified towns of the Western Xia. The Emperor Shenzong of Song rewarded Shen with numerous titles for his merit in these battles, and in the sixteen months of Shen's military campaign, he received 273 letters from the Emperor. However, Emperor Shenzong trusted an arrogant military officer who disobeyed the emperor and Shen's proposal for strategic fortifications, instead fortifying what Shen considered useless strategic locations. Furthermore, this officer expelled Shen from his commanding post at the main citadel, so as to deny <b>him</b> <b>any</b> glory in chance of victory. The result of this was nearly catastrophic, as the forces of the arrogant officer were decimated; Xinzhong Yao states that the death toll was 60,000. Nonetheless, Shen was successful in defending his fortifications and the only possible Tangut invasion-route to Yanzhou.|$|E
