[...] Speaking about the channel, Paul said, [...] "I {{was at a}} debate one time a couple years ago, where I didn't think I got a fair shake. In a two-hour debate, I had 89 seconds. <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>maybe</b> there's {{something wrong with the}} media. Maybe they're not covering us fairly. I'm just using it as a pun, but there’s a bit of truth to this. We don't get a fair shake. The people who believe in liberty and limited government don't expect it from the ordinary media." [...] Speaking about his youth appeal, he noted, [...] "They don’t sit and watch TV and turn the programs on at seven o'clock to watch us like that – so I thought the technology was there. The country is ripe for the continuation of this revolution." ...|$|E
500|$|The Daily Star quoted Rowland on {{the theme}} of the song. She said [...] "I hope to see women singing the song like they're in charge. It's {{important}} to know that we are commanders who have the power to shape our own destiny." [...] Love explained to Rap-Up magazine his view of the song, [...] "It's just such an aggressive record, it's a club record, it's a worldwide international record. She's stretching her legs out and she's showing her true vocal ability, she's like the queen of the night on this record." [...] Then during the video shoot of the song Rowland said [...] "I feel like I've finally come into my own," [...] a reference to the exploration of a new musical sound. [...] "With the sound of dance music getting embraced more, I'm very excited, seeing how fans have been responding to the music. Dance music is more of a European thing, but I've been looking on Twitter and seeing fans (in different parts of the country) talking about playing 'Commander'." [...] She said working with Guetta was [...] "amazing" [...] because it is [...] "effortless" [...] and she feels a great sense of [...] "chemistry" [...] when working with him. Rowland felt she was trying something different: [...] "In this generation and this day and time, no one is putting soul in dance music... no pop artist. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>maybe</b> that was something I could try. And then it works." [...] In an interview for MSN Xin Rowland admitted the song was [...] "darker" [...] than her previous material but still fun. [...] "I just thought it'd be so much fun to be a commander of course. It's just a statement for me definitely, coming out on my own, filling my space. I'm happy being a commander".|$|E

2500|$|The show's creators {{claim that}} they weren't {{engaging}} in a product placement strategy for commercial gain. One motivation {{for the use of}} real-world products, quite unrelated to commercial considerations, is the comedy value of funny-sounding phrases and words. [...] "I knew I wanted Kramer to think of watching the operation like going to see a movie", explained Seinfeld writer/producer Andy Robin in an interview published in the Hollywood Reporter. [...] "At first, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>maybe</b> a piece of popcorn falls into the patient. I ran that by my brother, and he said, 'No, Junior Mints are just funnier.'" ...|$|E

While a high school student, Kondabolu repeatedly watched a Margaret Cho special on the then-new Comedy Central cable network [...] "in awe, because up until then I had never seen an Asian-American comedian. There she was up there—strong and funny and talking about her parents. That {{was the first time}} <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>maybe</b> I could try this."

Tanner said that at first he had thought Skills would become an {{important}} character, but later had come to doubt it. [...] "My character was originally on the thing as recurring, possible series regular, and I was told that once we got picked up my character would become a series regular", he said. [...] "Then when I didn't and the show went in a different direction, I was kind of like, 'Uh-oh.' I didn't think the fans took to him at first, so <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>maybe</b> that's why the studio did it like that. But now he's doing his thing, so I ain't mad at it.

2500|$|The next day, the FA {{confirmed}} {{that they had}} charged Suárez with violent conduct, while Liverpool fined Suárez an undisclosed amount which he requested be donated to the Hillsborough Family Support Group. Suárez declared that he thought a three-match ban would suffice. His previous victim, Otman Bakkal, described it as [...] "unbelievable" [...] that Suárez could bite a second player, and was left flabbergasted at the incident, stating that [...] "at first <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>maybe</b> {{it was an accident}} but, apparently, he loses it sometimes". Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) chairman Gordon Taylor said that Suárez would be offered anger management counselling. Gus Poyet thought the reaction had been exaggerated, theorising that Suárez could leave English football if he carried on being punished and maligned for his actions, treatment he thought was hypocritical when compared to others.|$|E
2500|$|Blackwell {{first became}} {{interested}} in music through the influence of her fourth grade teacher, Nancy Notargiacomo, who eventually became her voice and piano teacher when she was 10. She also credits her high school choral director for encouraging her to pursue a music career. In a 2003 interview Blackwell recalled, [...] "I {{did not come from}} a musical family. I had a fourth grade teacher that introduced me to music and I sang at the Catholic church. In high school I started doing musicals − The Sound of Music, Brigadoon, Oliver!, and so forth. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>maybe</b> this would be what I would pursue after high school, although even in my {{senior year in high school}} I had doubts. I wanted to go into history or fashion design. But, I had a wonderful choral director who said 'no, your calling is music,' and she convinced me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Silivaș's {{score on}} vault came under {{particular}} scrutiny. Of the six judges on the panel, three gave her first vault a 10.0; two others gave her 9.9s. However, the Soviet {{judge on the}} panel, Nellie Kim, gave her a 9.8. On her second vault, Silivaș took a hop on her landing; all six judges gave her 9.9s. Silivaș was visibly upset after Shushunova's scores were posted and at the medal ceremony; {{according to a report}} in International Gymnast, she said, [...] "After my last vault, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>maybe</b> I should be the champion." [...] However, she did not argue the results publicly. Her former coach, Bela Károlyi, noted, [...] "This kid had the honesty and decency to shut up. She didn’t want to say 'I’m better' because she knows Shushunova is the Olympic champion, but she couldn’t praise a rival. So she just didn’t say a word. These kids have more decency than all the judges and coaches in the world." ...|$|E
