40|$|The {{criteria}} {{adopted by}} the SEAFO Commission {{for the establishment of}} a <b>fishing</b> <b>footprint,</b> “if an area has been fished in two consecutive years during the period 1987 - 2007 ”, is considered not a good starting point for any rigorous analysis of the historical spatial effort in the region because of losing valuable data and the difficulties on its application. Spanish data consisting in 1191 records of haul by haul (August 1996 - November 2006) were analyzed using a protocol developed by New Zealand at SPRFMO to study trawl footprints in this region. The use of 20 ’x 20 ’ blocks method clearly overestimate the footprint. Thus, 10 ’ gridding fits better <b>fishing</b> <b>footprint</b> area. However, at any case more than one point (e. g., midpoint) has to be used to define a set/haul position. Longlining is the fishing activity more widely spread out with 144 blocks (8. 79 %) of which 67 % “lightly fished”; and 33 % “moderately fished”. However, bottom trawl tend to concentrate its activity in small areas as Valdivia Bank and the North-East of the Walvis Ridge, with 5 “heavily fished” blocks (0. 31 %). A general vision of current and recent past situation of fisheries in the SEAFO region was also mad...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the results from the}} analysis of data acquired during the NEREIDA survey programme (2009 - 2010) around the Flemish Cap and the tail of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland (NAFO Regulatory Area). Biological samples were collected using a mega box-core, which were processed for the extraction and identification of benthic macrofauna. A suite of physical samples and environmental measurements was also collected for evaluation. Analyses revealed the presence of benthic assemblages that were indicative of Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VME). VME indicative assemblages were present mostly outside of the <b>fishing</b> <b>footprint.</b> A simple habitat suitability model identified areas that are likely to accommodate VME indicative assemblages. Areas with the greatest potential to accommodate VME assemblages closely correspond with areas already managed for the protection of VME, where bottom-contact fishing practices are presently excluded. Such results support the notion that existing bottom-fishery exclusion zones should continue to be enforced for the long-term protection of VME. En prensa 2, 277...|$|E
40|$|Coastal {{fisheries}} {{contribute to}} global food security, since fish {{are an important}} source of protein for many coastal communities in the world. However, they are constrained by problems, such as weak management of fisheries and overfishing. Local communities perceive that they are fishing less, as in other fisheries in the world. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the fisheries sustainability in the Jalisco coast through the <b>fishing</b> <b>footprint,</b> or fishprint (FP), based on the primary productivity required (PPR) and the appropriated surface by the activity (biocapacity). The total catch was 20, 448. 2 metric tons from 2002 - 2012, and the average footprint was calculated to be 65, 458 gha/year, a figure that quadrupled in a period of 10 years; the biocapacity decreased, and the average trophic level of catches was 3. 1, which implies that it has remained at average levels, resulting in a positive balance between biocapacity and ecological footprint. Therefore, under this approach, the fishing activity is sustainable along the coast of Jalisco...|$|E

40|$|Acrobat document, 2 {{tables and}} 7 Figures. 13 pagesAt the South-East Atlantic, {{fisheries}} resources have been commercially explored {{by a large}} international fleet fishing mostly in the Namibian waters. The Spanish and the former Soviet Union have been the predominant distant fleet working at the continental shelf and their activities were managed until 1990 by the International Commission for the South-East Atlantic Fisheries (ICSEAF). Historically, the following countries {{are known to have}} been fishing in the current SEAFO Convention Area. Spain, Portugal, Russia, Cyprus, Mauritius, Japan, Korea, Poland, Norway, South Africa and Namibia, but {{the quality and quantity of}} data available remain poor (SEAFO, 2008). Thus, the main activities of some of these fleets occur on the continental shelf (EEZ) and sporadically they explored adjacent seamounts, sometime on the route between fishing grounds or as a target activity. This paper intends to stress the importance of bottom <b>fishing</b> <b>footprint</b> as a method to understand the extent of the areas fished up to date in the SEAFO region. For this exercise some available data from the Spanish and Portuguese fleets were used...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of the Maritime Spatial Planning Directive and with the {{intention}} of contributing to the implementation of a future maritime spatial plan, it was decided to analyze data from the small scale coastal fisheries sector of Greece and estimate the actual extent of its activities, which is largely unknown to date. To this end we identified the most influential components affecting coastal fishing: fishing capacity, bathymetry, distance from coast, Sea Surface Chlorophyll (Chl-a) concentration, legislation, marine traffic activity, trawlers and purse seiners fishing effort and no-take zones. By means of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) conducted through a stepwise procedure, the potential <b>fishing</b> <b>footprint</b> with the corresponding fishing intensity was derived. The method provides an innovative and cost-effective way {{to assess the impact of}} the, notoriously hard to assess, coastal fleet. It was further considered how the inclusion of all relevant anthropogenic activities (besides fishing) could provide the background needed to plan future marine activities in the framework of Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) and form the basis for a more realistic management approach...|$|E
40|$|This report {{utilizes}} {{a geographic}} information systems (GIS) modelling approach to simulate commercial groundfish trawling sponge by-catch {{in lieu of}} actual commercial observations {{within the confines of}} current management restrictions to fishing within the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization Regulatory Area (e. g., coral and sponge closed areas). Simulated trawl start locations (1500) were generated by using an aggregated 2008 - 2009 groundfishing effort raster asa probability surface. This effort surface was also used toset a heading for each of the lines following the direction corresponding to the maximum sum of effort. Combined and standardized sponge bycatch data from the Spanish and Canadian research vesseltrawls were used to create a by-catch sponge biomass surface. The model extracted the spongebiomass values to each line to calculate the total by-catch per line (kg). Artificially imposing a range of threshold values on simulated by-catch data showed very few simulated trawls (0. 4 %) would catch more than the 800 kg encounter threshold of sponge under current management conditions. The percentage of simulated trawls above the imposed range ofthreshold values does not start to increase quickly until the threshold was between ~ 30 and 50 kg. At 50 kg of simulated by-catch, only 5. 5 % of simulated tows would be affected and could be easily avoided as the areas impacted are localized. If the current encounter threshold for sponges was reduced from 800 kg to between 30 and 50 kg per tow it is unlikely to have a large effect on the commercial fishery within the <b>fishing</b> <b>footprint</b> and would serve as a more effective sponge conservation measure in un-fished areas under an exploratory fishery.

These closures will be reviewed in 2014. NAFO has also delineated existing bottom <b>fishing</b> areas (<b>footprint),</b> {{in response to}} the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA Res. 61/105, paragraph 83) request for Regional Fisheries Management Organizations to regulate bottom fisheries that cause a significant adverse impact on vulnerable marine ecosystems.|$|R
50|$|Fossils {{are found}} near Parrsboro, Blue Beach {{and other areas}} along the Avon River. Rarely, fossils have been found at Evangeline Beach, Burntcoat Head, and other locations. These fossils include various shells (brachiopods, molluscs), sponges, trees, fish, amphibians, reptiles, and dinosaurs. Trace fossils include {{vertebrate}} <b>footprints,</b> <b>fish</b> fin-tracks, invertebrate trackways (ex. scorpions at Blue Beach), raindrop inprints, and wave ripples. They range {{from the beginning of}} the Carboniferous to the Jurassic. They were deposited when the region was warm and tropical, later when it was covered by a shallow sea, and later still when it was a desert.|$|R
40|$|Genes {{involved}} in vertebrate development are unusually enriched for highly conserved non-coding sequence elements. These regions are readily detected in silico, by genome-wide sequence comparisons between different vertebrates, from mammals to <b>fish</b> (phylogenetic <b>footprinting).</b> It follows that sequence conservation {{must be the}} result of positive selection for an essential physiological role. An obvious possibility is that these conserved sequences possess regulatory or structural functions important for gene expression and, thus, an in vivo assay becomes necessary. We have developed a rapid testing system using zebrafish and Xenopus laevis embryos that allows us to assign transcriptional regulatory functions to conserved non-coding sequence elements. The sequences are cloned into a vector containing a minimal promoter and the GFP reporter, and are assayed for their putative cis-regulatory activity in zebrafish or Xenopus transgenic experiments. Vectors used include plasmid DNA and the Tol 2 transposon system in fish and X laevis. We have followed this logic to detect and analyze conserved elements in an intergenic region present in the Iroquois (Irx) gene clusters of zebrafish, Xenopus tropicalis, Fugu rubripes and mouse. We have assayed similar to 50 of these conserved elements and shown that the majority behave as modular positive regulatory elements (enhancers) that contribute to specific temporal and spatial domains {{that are part of the}} endogenous gene expression pattern. Moreover, comparison of the activity of cognate Irx enhancers from different organisms demonstrates that conservation of sequence is accompanied by in vivo functional conservation across species. Finally, for some of the most conserved elements, we have been able to identify a critical core sequence, essential for correct enhancer function...|$|R
40|$|The United Nations General Assembly Resolution 61 / 105, {{concerning}} sustainable {{fisheries in}} the marine ecosystem, calls {{for the protection of}} vulnerable marine ecosystems (VME) from destructive fishing practices. Subsequently, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) produced guidelines for identification of VME indicator species/taxa to assist in the implementation of the resolution, but recommended the development of case-specific operational definitions for their application. We applied kernel density estimation (KDE) to research vessel trawl survey data from inside the <b>fishing</b> <b>footprint</b> of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) Regulatory Area in the high seas of the northwest Atlantic to create biomass density surfaces for four VME indicator taxa: large-sized sponges, sea pens, small and large gorgonian corals. These VME indicator taxa were identified previously by NAFO using the fragility, life history characteristics and structural complexity criteria presented by FAO, along with an evaluation of their recovery trajectories. KDE, a non-parametric neighbour-based smoothing function, has been used previously in ecology to identify hotspots, that is, areas of relatively high biomass/abundance. We present a novel approach of examining relative changes in area under polygons created from encircling successive biomass categories on the KDE surface to identify "significant concentrations" of biomass, which we equate to VMEs. This allows identification of the VMEs from the broader distribution of the species in the study area. We provide independent assessments of the VMEs so identified using underwater images, benthic sampling with other gear types (dredges, cores), and/or published species distribution models of probability of occurrence, as available. For each VME indicator taxon we provide a brief review of their ecological function which will be important in future assessments of significant adverse impact on these habitats here and elsewhere...|$|E
40|$|Fisher {{behaviour}} {{remains a}} key source of uncertainty in fisheries management. Failing {{to account for}} the behavioural response of fishers can lead to unexpected or unintended consequences of management; our understanding of fisher behaviour, as well as our ability to translate this understanding into predictive management models, is underdeveloped. This thesis aimed to develop an individual-based model (IBM) that could be used by fishers and managers to evaluate the impacts of management scenarios in the Isle of Man scallop fishery. Questionnaire interview data and a conjoint analysis were used to understand fishing behaviour and to generate realistic parameters to input to an IBM of fishing activity. Vessel monitoring system (VMS) and logbook data were also analysed to inform the model development, and to provide the data against which the model could be validated. There is increasing interest in using automatic identification system (AIS) as an alternative to VMS when investigating fishing activity, so a comparison of AIS and VMS data was presented, highlighting substantial gaps in the coverage of AIS data. By using simple foraging decision rules, parameterised by questionnaire data, it was possible to build an IBM that could reproduce patterns seen in the Isle of Man scallop fishery with reasonable similarity. Comparing multiple submodels of fishing behaviour provided insights into predicting fishing activity, and identified the most structurally realistic models. It illustrated the importance of incorporating random behaviour in a model design, potentially to account for social aspects of fishing decisions that are more difficult to quantify. It also demonstrated that predicting responses to management by modelling fishers as optimal foragers that act in an economically rational manner may overestimate the capacity of the fleet to compensate for restrictions such as closed areas, and underestimate the <b>fishing</b> <b>footprint.</b> Fishery systems may be too complex to distil to a single simple and ‘accurate’ model, but having a suite of models that together give a reasonable representation of the fishery could allow the range of likely impacts of management to be better considered. This thesis demonstrates the value of individual-based modelling for both understanding fisher behaviour and predicting the outcomes of management. It has also provided strong evidence to support the use of questionnaire interview data in modelling fishing activity. Comprehensively documenting the stages of model development provided a transparent model validation which would enable managers to make informed decisions about how to apply such a model. Using an IBM to predict the response of fishers to management could facilitate more informed compromises between management objectives, and reduce uncertainty in fisheries management...|$|E
