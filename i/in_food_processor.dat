40|$|Nutrition is an {{important}} and modifiable factor in growth and preservation of bone was as well as prevention of osteoporosis. This research was conducted to survey the status of nutrient affecting bone formation with reference to DRI. This descriptive - analytical study was conducted on 100 healthy elderly subjects in Sabzevar, Iran. Their weight and height were measured and 24 hour recall of nutritional intake were filled out in 3 successive days. All food were encoded <b>in</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> software to assess the amount of nutrients. One - sample t - test, independent sample t - test and descriptive statistics were used in SPSS for data analysis. Fifty one men and and fourty nine women participated in the study; their mean age were 69. 82 ± 6. 87 and 67. 34 ± 5. 62 and their BMI were 22. 92 ± 3. 16 and 22. 19 ± 3. 43 kg/m 2 respectively. Nutritional intake of PUFA, vitamins C, K, E, D and as well as mineral such as Ca, P, Mg, K, Zn, and Cu were less than DRI standards (p= 0. 0001) while protein and Fe intake were higher (p= 0. 0001). Also, a {{significant difference was found}} between men and women in their intake of PUFA (p= 0. 04) and protein (p= 0. 03). The findings revealed that the intake of most nutrients, with the exception of sodium, iron and protein, is less than DRI standards in the elderly subjects. Therefore, they are recommended to protect themselves against bone loss to some extent by a diet of food variety, fruit, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products that are rich in bone-forming nutrients...|$|E

50|$|The {{day before}} baking pīrāgi, the cook usually spends {{one or two}} hours {{preparing}} any meat and onion that will be used. Bacon and other fatty meats (such as bacon or back bacon) do not chop well <b>in</b> a <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> and tend to get caught on the blade, so the cook must hand chop these into tiny cubes, about 1.5 millimetres (about 1/16 inches). This is sometimes made easier by freezing the meat for a few minutes. Other less fatty meats (such as beef) tend {{to turn into a}} paste <b>in</b> the <b>food</b> <b>processor,</b> so if the meat is not already ground, the cook grinds it using a hand or electric grinder.|$|R
50|$|Bisque is also {{commonly}} used, although incorrectly, {{to refer}} to cream-based soups that do not contain seafood, in which the sometimes pre-cooked ingredients are pureed or processed <b>in</b> a <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> or a <b>food</b> mill.

Briefly, minced tissue pools were placed in pre-weighed porcelain trays for drying at 80  °C for 24  h and then weighed to the nearest 0.001  g. Subsequently, dry mussels’ tissue pools were ashed at 450  °C for 4  h in a muffle furnace, cooled in a desiccator and weighed again to determine the ash-free dry weight content.|$|R
50|$|Emulsified {{sausages}} {{are cooked}} sausages {{with a very}} fine texture, using the combination of pork, beef, or poultry with fat, salt, cure, flavorings, and water. These ingredients are emulsified at high speed <b>in</b> a <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> or blender. During this process, the salt dissolves the muscle proteins, which helps to suspend the fat molecules. Temperature {{is an important part}} of the process: if the temperature rises above 60°F (16°C) for pork or 70°F (21°C) for beef, the emulsion will not hold and fat will leak from the sausage during the cooking process.|$|R

To examine the prevalence and patterns of contamination <b>in</b> <b>food</b> processing facilities <b>in</b> Ireland, 48 <b>food</b> <b>processors</b> submitted 8 samples every 2 months from March 2013 to March 2014 to be analyzed for L. monocytogenes. No positive samples were detected for 38 % of the processing facilities tested. Isolates found at the remaining 62 % of facilities were characterized by serotyping and Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE). A general L. monocytogenes prevalence of 4. 6 % was seen in all samples analyzed with similar rates seen <b>in</b> <b>food</b> and environmental samples. Differences in prevalence were seen across different <b>food</b> <b>processors,</b> <b>food</b> sectors, sampling months etc. and PFGE analysis allowed for the examination of contamination patterns and for the identification of several persistent strains.
