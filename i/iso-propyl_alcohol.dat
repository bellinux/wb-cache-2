Most current gasoline-powered automobiles can safely run up to a 10% ethanol solution without any modification. However, at 15% or above older vehicles may require replacing the fuel lines to prevent degradation and rupture, and the electric fuel pump may need modification to prevent ethanol [...] "dry rot". The belief that dry gas is not needed because of the significant amount of ethanol is largely true because ethanol is a drying agent. Due to this fact it has an affinity for water which can {{be present in the}} atmosphere, but since environmental concerns have caused fuel systems to be closed, it works effectively on the moisture inside the tank which was already present. The water that has been [...] "absorbed" [...] then reduces issues with freezing fuel lines. The action of adding dry gas (anhydrous methanol or azeotropic <b>iso-propyl</b> <b>alcohol)</b> is suggested to mix with absorbed water lowering the freezing point of the now water and alcohol solution, lower than it would mixed with ethanol, allowing the fuel lines to better resist freezing, while non-frozen water will be removed when either solution is used by the engine.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, the likeliness of an attack from {{explosives}} has increased dramatically. Hence, the {{need to find a}} reliable device with the ability to detect explosives has increased even more. Sensing schemes based on micro-cantilever beams and their bending responses to specific explosives are considered to be an effective technique for explosives detection. In this study the bending responses of an array of micro-cantilever beams integrated with micro-heaters are recorded when they are exposed to various combustible materials. The results show that the micro-cantilever beams display a distinct response when exposed to different combustible materials. In the experiments it was observed that typically the deflection of the micro-cantilever beam in response to the thermal bi-metallic actuation was greater when exposed to acetone vapors than that for alcohol and air.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to demonstrate the ability to detect the presence of energetic materials by analyzing the bending response of an electrically heated micro-cantilever thermal bi-morph array. Heating the cantilevers that are made of materials with different coefficients of thermal expansion affects the bending and is measured using an optical device in real time. The detection scheme is based on the threshold value of current that results in a deviation (from the control value) of the actuation of the micro-cantilver. This threshold current is found to provide a unique signature to identify an equilibrium concentration of <b>iso-propyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> acetone or gasoline vapors at room temperature. The threshold current is proportional with the vapor pressure of the volatile species and the ignition temperature. This shows sensors can be used for specific detection of different energetic material. The sensor array can be used to detect and identify volatile combustibles species in real time. Further, the sensor array can be multiplexed (i. e., detect multiple explosives simultaneously) and also allows redundancy checks so that false positive or false negative results can be eliminated. The sensor permits detection without coming in contact with the contaminated surface or source of the combustible material because it detects the vapors effused by the explosive materials. Thus it can be used at a nominal distance away from the source...|$|E
40|$|Purpose Microalgae {{have a high}} {{potential}} as a feedstock {{for the production of}} biofuels, either indirectly, through the extraction of lipids, which can be transformed into biodiesel, or directly via whole cell conversion using hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). Both approaches have disadvantages, due to the high cost of cultivating microalgae with sufficient lipid content (> 40 %), while the whole cell conversion produces low quality oils, which require significant further upgrading. This work investigated the possibility of realising the benefits of both processes, by studying the liquefaction reaction of a lipid-extracted algae hydrolysate. Methods In order to enhance oil yields, the reaction was conducted in the presence of varying loadings of <b>iso-propyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> (IPA) and applied two waste steel furnace residues as potential liquefaction catalysts. Results Primarily, The lipid extraction process needs to be optimized {{to reduce the amount of}} acid contaminant within the liquefaction medium. For the HTL process, the addition of 50 vol% IPA resulted in remarkably high oil yields of up to 60. 2 wt% on an organic basis, whereas the two furnace residues had no positive effect on the product distribution, and instead favoured the formation of solid reaction products. Nevertheless, the results suggested that the presence of iron potentially reduced the nitrogen and oxygen content of the bio-oil. Conclusions As such, HTL is a suitable method for valorising lipid-extracted algal biomass, where the bio-oil yields can be enhanced substantially by using IPA in conjunction with the water...|$|E

Metallic sub-wavelength apertures may be designed to support surface plasmon resonances that {{are sensitive to the}} surrounding environment when embedded at the end-face of an optical fibre. Factors contributing to the liquid refractive index sensitivity are explored systematically through simulation, theory, and experiment. The optical fibre sensor (OFS) is a novel sensing device based on surface plasmon resonance technology and metallic nanostructure materials. The sensitivity of the sensor can be tailored by designing a suitable periodic array of sub-wavelength apertures. In the sensing mechanism, liquids such as water, acetone and <b>iso-propyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> were used to test the sensing surface of the optical fibre end-face. The identification of different refractive indices can be achieved by measuring the wavelength difference variations of spectral features and the light intensity from the reflection spectra of the OFS. The proposed sensor is compact in size and suitable for remote sensing. The sensor needs only a small volume of the liquid being tested and it is easy to use. It is evident that experimental results are in good agreement with theoretical results. However, the result of this study determined that it is unlikely that an OFS based on a periodic metallic nanostructure at the fibre end-face will produce a sensor with superior sensitivity to variations in liquid refractive index (RI) as compared to cheaper existing technologies...|$|E

40|$|The microcontamination {{of optical}} {{surfaces}} or optical thin films affects {{many of their}} properties. In this work, we investigated several measurement systems to detect many types of surface contamination of coatings based on the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) phenomenon. The attenuated total reflection (ATR) coupling, {{also known as the}} Kretschmann configuration, excited the nonradiative surface plasmon wave for SPR measurement. Several microcontamination layers thinner than 10 nm were studied. The results showed that in all the cases SPR curves shifted to larger incident angles. From the amount of angle shift, the thickness of contamination was determined with a sensitivity of as little as one angstrom. The optical constants of those contamination layers were also derived. The shifts of the SPR curves served as an index for the efficiency of cleaning processes. It was found that the contamination by moisture can be removed with <b>Iso-propyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> by the ultrasonic cleaning process, while acetone was the more effective solvent in removing the contamination left by strippable coating residue show that the contamination layer was roughened by ultrasonic cleaning. In studies of island-like discontinuous thin layers of Ag, Al, and MgF₂, we found that the refractive index of MgF₂, a dielectric film material, slightly decreased as the thickness decreased, but for discontinuous metal films, the optical constants changed rapidly and became more dielectric in nature. Direct detection of contamination by coating processes in a small vacuum chamber was also carried out. In a chamber with high backstreaming from a diffusion pump, a broad SPR curve for an Ag film revealed obvious optical constant changes. Measuring and comparing the shift indicates that a significant amount of contamination was occurring right after the coating was completed. This suggests that for good evaporated optical thin films, {{it is important to have}} a more tightly controlled evaporation process. Finally, particulate, as well as layered, contamination can also be measured. A radiative SPR wave was generated by illuminating a contaminated surface. Similar radiative SPR waves also can be observed by adding a rough contaminant layer on an Ag film...|$|E
40|$|Visual {{observations}} using camera {{systems on}} the tethered ROV Isis deployed during the 2008 JC 024 cruise to the Mid Atlantic Ridge at 45 °N showed numerous monogenetic volcanoes that are essentially piles of lava pillows. The pillows are usually ~ 1 m diameter and > 2 m long and form mounds with average dimensions around 300 m diameter, ~ 150 m altitude, and 0. 005 km 3 volume. Small protrusions, 10 - 50 cm long, which are numerous on pillows {{appear to be}} the youngest regions, were sampled using the pincers on the hydraulic arms of Isis, and returned to the surface. On the surface, any glass crust on the pillow protrusions was chiselled off using clean tools and double bagged in polythene. In the laboratory a portion of the glass was crushed in a jeweller’s roller mill and sieved using stainless steel sieves to obtain a sufficient amount of the fraction 0. 125 - 0. 250 mm for hand picking, using a binocular microscope with the glass submerged in a mix of water and <b>iso-propyl</b> <b>alcohol.</b> The samples were subsequently leached using the procedure of Standish & Sims. Samples were spiked with a mixed 229 Th- 236 U spike and the U, Th and Ra fractions were separated and purified using standard chemistry methods. U and Th isotope ratios were determined using a Nu Instruments MC-ICPMS and Ra isotope ratios were determined using a MAT- 262 -RPQII TIMS instrument. The U-series data were evaluated using a MathCad program based on published equations. The data can be successfully modelled by assuming the ‘accepted’ mantle upwelling rate for the region of 11 mm. y - 1. The U-Th characteristics are mostly derived during ‘porous flow’ magma upwelling in the garnet stability zone, ranging to a depth of 60 km with incipient melting starting at 70 km. Above 60 km depth the melt fraction will be > 3 % and the mantle mineralogy devoid of phases that fractionate U-Th significantly. Moreover, at melt fractions > 3 %, channel flow will be dominant and magma will transit to eruption on time-scales that are short enough to retain the U-Th characteristics from the garnet zone. The rheology of the deep mantle is such that melt generation should be in ‘steady state’ and U-Th characteristics should be constant. On that assumption, measured differences in collected samples can be used to calculate model ages relative to the ‘youngest’ sample, thus allowing the construction of a relative eruption timescale. However, significant fractional crystallisation is taking place in the oceanic crust, as testified by the frequent presence of plagioclase crystals up to mm-size in the glass samples. A ‘magma chamber’ on a scale larger than the magma channels is not required and we aim to assess the rate of plagioclase crystal growth using a 226 Ra chronometer. This chronometer requires the assumption that Ba-Ra fractionation is constant and can then also be used to calculate a relative model age timescale, provided that not all samples are > 8000 y old, which we consider unlikely...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Under the increasing pressure of issues like reducing the time to market, managing lower production costs, and improving the flexibility of operation, batch process industries thrive towards the production of high value added commodity, i. e. specialty chemicals, pharmaceuticals, agricultural, and biotechnology enabled products. For better design, consistent operation and improved control of batch chemical processes one cannot ignore the sensing and computational blessings provided by modern sensors, computers, algorithms, and software. In addition, {{there is a growing}} demand for modelling and control tools based on process operating data. This study is focused on developing process operation data-based iterative learning control (ILC) strategies for batch processes, more specifically for batch crystallisation systems. In order to proceed, the research took a step backward to explore the existing control strategies, fundamentals, mechanisms, and various process analytical technology (PAT) tools used in batch crystallisation control. From the basics of the background study, an operating data-driven ILC approach was developed to improve the product quality from batch-to-batch. The concept of ILC is to exploit the repetitive nature of batch processes to automate recipe updating using process knowledge obtained from previous runs. The methodology stated here was based on the linear time varying (LTV) perturbation model in an ILC framework to provide a convergent batch-to-batch improvement of the process performance indicator. In an attempt to create uniqueness in the research, a novel hierarchical ILC (HILC) scheme was proposed for the systematic design of the supersaturation control (SSC) of a seeded batch cooling crystalliser. This model free control approach is implemented in a hierarchical structure by assigning data-driven supersaturation controller on the upper level and a simple temperature controller in the lower level. In order to familiarise with other data based control of crystallisation processes, the study rehearsed the existing direct nucleation control (DNC) approach. However, this part was more committed to perform a detailed strategic investigation of different possible structures of DNC and to compare the results with that of a first principle model based optimisation for the very first time. The DNC results in fact outperformed the model based optimisation approach and established an ultimate guideline to select the preferable DNC structure. Batch chemical processes are distributed as well as nonlinear in nature which need to be operated over a wide range of operating conditions and often near the boundary of the admissible region. As the linear lumped model predictive controllers (MPCs) often subject to severe performance limitations, there is a growing demand of simple data driven nonlinear control strategy to control batch crystallisers that will consider the spatio-temporal aspects. In this study, an operating data-driven polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) based nonlinear surrogate modelling and optimisation strategy was presented for batch crystallisation processes. Model validation and optimisation results confirmed this approach as a promise to nonlinear control. The evaluations of the proposed data based methodologies were carried out by simulation case studies, laboratory experiments and industrial pilot plant experiments. For all the simulation case studies a detailed mathematical models covering reaction kinetics and heat mass balances were developed for a batch cooling crystallisation system of Paracetamol in water. Based on these models, rigorous simulation programs were developed in MATLAB®, which was then treated as the real batch cooling crystallisation system. The laboratory experimental works were carried out using a lab scale system of Paracetamol and <b>iso-Propyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> (IPA). All the experimental works including the qualitative and quantitative monitoring of the crystallisation experiments and products demonstrated an inclusive application of various in situ process analytical technology (PAT) tools, such as focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM), UV/Vis spectroscopy and particle vision measurement (PVM) as well. The industrial pilot scale study was carried out in GlaxoSmithKline Bangladesh Limited, Bangladesh, and the system of experiments was Paracetamol and other powdered excipients used to make paracetamol tablets. The methodologies presented in this thesis provide a comprehensive framework for data-based dynamic optimisation and control of crystallisation processes. All the simulation and experimental evaluations of the proposed approaches emphasised the potential of the data-driven techniques to provide considerable advances in the current state-of-the-art in crystallisation control...|$|E
40|$|Organic {{solvents}} {{have recently}} attracted much interest for wet processin g of silicon wafers during the fabrication of microelectronic devices. D uring these processes, surface contamination from nano-sized particles m ust be controlled to ensure high device yields. This control requires a fundamental {{knowledge of the}} interactions between particles and substrat es in the processing liquid. Such interactions are well known in aqueous solutions, but not in organic solvents. This thesis investigates partic le-substrate interactions in organic liquids, which have a lower dielect ric constant than water (i. e. low polarity). Alcohols and dodecane were chosen as representative for solvents of medium and low polarity, respec tively. Particle-substrate interactions in these solvents were studied a s {{a function of the}} dielectric constant of the liquid, the type and roug hness of the solid surfaces, the presence of ionic contaminants and chem ical additives. First, the surface forces between micro-sized particles and flat substrates o f the same material were measured in these solvents using colloidal-prob e atomic force microscopy. In all alcohols the surface forces were repul sive, and well described by classical aqueous-based theories. Immersion experiments demonstrated that these findings were also valid for nano-si zed particles. However, the level of background ionic contaminants in th e solvents had an important effect on the magnitude and range of the int eractions. On the contrary, in dodecane the surface forces were mostly a ttractive and fundamentally very different from the interaction forces i n aqueous systems. In particular, these forces were time dependent and e xtremely sensitive to the experimental conditions such as the presence o f electrical charges and of trace levels of water, and the surface rough ness of the particles. Adding a surface active agent at relatively high concentration, the surface forces could be controlled and turned into re pulsive. All these findings suggested that alcohols are potentially good solvents to use in wet processing with respect to the prevention from p article contamination, whereas dodecane is to be avoided. Once a first screening of solvents was made, <b>iso-propyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> solutions wer e further explored, and the study was extended to various systems where particles and substrates were made of different materials. A new experim ental setup was built to monitor in-situ the deposition and removal of n ano-sized particles onto/from flat substrates in these alcohol solutions. The new technique, consisting of an impinging jet cell in combination with ellipsometry, enabled to study in-situ the kinetics of particle dep osition and removal in the diffusive regime, under well defined hydrodyn amic conditions. The effect of chemical additives such as hydrochloric a cid and surfactant on the deposition behavior was also studied. In pure alcohol, the deposition or non-deposition behavior was determined by the relative surface charge of the particles with respect to the flat subst rates. Particle deposition was driven by diffusion at initial times, whe n the surface particle coverage of the flat substrate was relatively low. At higher times, when the flat substrate was significantly covered by particles, electrical repulsive forces between the particles suppressed the deposition process. This in turn resulted in low maximum particle su rface coverage. The addition of hydrochloric acid resulted in an overall increase in ionic strength. This fact led to an overall increase in the surface potentials of both particles and substrates, thus particle depo sition was observed even in the case of similar surfaces. In the bulk so lution moreover, an increase in ionic strength caused a suppression of t he electrical repulsive forces between particles and substrates, and als o between the particles. As a result, the deposition was diffusion-limit ed at all times and the maximum values for the particle surface coverage were equla to the predictions for uncharged particles. The addition of surfactant, used either to pre-treat the flat surface or as a co-dispers ant, prevented particle deposition. For the first time it was demonstrat ed that, when particles and substrates are made of different material, t he length scale has a dramatic consequence on the interactions. The surf ace forces for rough micro-sized spheres always revealed repulsive inter actions, even in those systems where nano-sized particles were found to deposit onto the substrate. This fact was explained by the presence of s urface heterogeneities on the flat substrates that cause local fluctuati ons in the average value of the surface charge. In this sense, nano-size d particles might deposit at some specific spots on the flat substrate w here the local surface charge is opposite with respect to that of the pa rticles. In case of micro-sized particles, the influence of local surfac e domains on the total interaction becomes negligible. Second, the surfa ce roughness of the interacting spheres has a dominant effect on the sur face force at short separations. Micro-sized spheres are very rough andexhibit an overall repulsive force at short separations. Nano-sized part icles, which are relatively smooth in comparison, might exhibit very dif ferent surface forces at short separation. In absence of long-range elec trical forces, these forces at short separation determine the deposition behavior. The l ast part of this thesis deals with the in-situ removal of previously dep osited particles by using alcohol/surfactant solutions. The type of surf actant investigated, when used at concentrations higher than a specific threshold value, was able to remove previously deposited particles. The amount of removed particles increased with increasing surfactant concent ration until total removal was reached. A double kinetics was observed i n the particle removal process, higher at initial times and subsequently lower. A mechanism for particle removal was proposed, where local gradi ents in surface tension were created around the particle-substrate conta ct area due to the preferential adsorption of surfactant molecules on th e solid surfaces. These gradients originate a lifting force that pushes the particle away from the flat substrate. This thesis clearly demonstrates that dodecane is a bad solvent for wet proce ssing of wafers. The risk of surface particle contamination in this solv ent is very high. Within the same application, alcohols are beneficial s olvents to use. A big drawback using these solvents is that the level of ionic contamination must be strictly controlled, as well as the homogen eity of the surfaces of the flat substrates. However, a solution was pro posed that consists in the use of dedicated surfactant. The latter enabl es to prevent particle deposition and even to remove deposited particles. status: publishe...|$|E
