6000|$|At last, however, {{after much}} inquiry, I {{arrive at the}} place, make my peace with the gardener, and enter. My disillusion dates from {{the opening of the}} garden door. I repine, I find a reluctation of spirit against believing that this is the place. What, is this kailyard that inexhaustible paradise of a garden in which M---- and I found [...] "elbow-room," [...] and expatiated {{together}} without sensible constraint? Is that little turfed slope the huge and perilous green bank down which I counted it a feat, and the gardener a sin, to run? Are these two squares of stone, some two feet high, the pedestals on which I walked with such a penetrating sense of dizzy elevation, and which I had expected to find on a level with my eyes? Ay, the place is no more like what I expected than this bleak April day is like the glorious September with which it is incorporated in my memory. I look at the gardener, disappointment in my face, and tell him that the place seems sorrily shrunken from the high estate that it had held in my remembrance, and he returns, with quiet laughter, by asking me how long it is since I was there. I tell him, and he remembers me. Ah! I say, I was a great nuisance, I believe. But no, my good gardener will plead guilty to having kept no record of my evil-doings, and I find myself much softened toward the place and willing to take a kinder view and pardon its shortcomings {{for the sake of the}} gardener and his pretended recollection of myself. And it is just at this stage (to complete my re-establishment) that I see a little boy--the gardener's grandchild--just about the same age and the same height that I must have been in the days when I was here last. My first feeling is one of almost anger, to see him playing on the gravel where I had played before, as if he had usurped something of my identity; but next moment I feel a softening and a sort of rising and qualm of the throat, accompanied by a pricking heat in the eye balls. I hastily <b>join</b> <b>conversation</b> with the child, and inwardly felicitate myself that the gardener is opportunely gone for the key of the house. But the child is a sort of homily to me. He is perfectly quiet and resigned, an unconscious hermit. I ask him jocularly if he gets as much abused as I used to do for running down the bank; but the child's perfect seriousness of answer staggers me--"O no, grandpapa doesn't allow it--why should he?" [...] I feel caught: I stand abashed at the reproof; I must not expose my childishness again to this youthful disciplinarian, and so I ask him very stately what he is going to be--a good serious practical question, out of delicacy for his parts. He answers that he is going to be a missionary to China, and tells me how a missionary once took him on his knee and told him about missionary work, and asked him if he, too, would not like to become one, to which the child had simply answered in the affirmative. The child is altogether so different from what I have been, is so absolutely complementary to what I now am, that I turn away not a little abashed from the conversation, for there is always something painful in sudden contact with the good qualities that we do not possess. Just then the grandfather returns; and I go with him to the summer-house, where I used to learn my Catechism, to the wall on which M----and I thought it no small exploit to walk upon, and all the other places that I remembered.|$|E

40|$|We {{focus on}} a form of <b>joining</b> <b>conversations</b> among {{multiple}} parties in service-oriented applications where a client may asynchronously <b>join</b> an existing <b>conversation</b> without need to know in advance any information about it. More specifically, we show how the correlation mechanism provided by or-chestration languages enables a form of <b>conversation</b> <b>joining</b> that is completely transparent to clients and that we call ‘blind-date joining’. We provide an implementation of this strategy by using the standard orchestration language WS-BPEL. We then present its formal semantics by resorting to COWS, a process calculus specifically designed for modelling service-oriented applications. We illustrate our approach {{by means of a}} simple, but realistic, case study from the online games domain. ...|$|R

30|$|Twitter {{is both a}} microblogging {{service and}} a {{conversational}} environment that enables people to interact, engage in daily chatter and <b>join</b> <b>conversations.</b> Conversations are key element in such service. Almost a quarter of Twitter users hold conversations with other users through this platform [14] and huge percentage of Twitter posts are conversational [21]. The public aspect of conversations makes Twitter one of the available publicity available resources of naturally occurring conversations. The huge volume of conversations produced everyday makes it an interesting information source. Thus, exploiting Twitter conversations to provide context for a given tweet is the main contribution of this paper.|$|R
