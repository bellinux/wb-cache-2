The neutral clusters are ionized, typically using pulsed laser or an electron beam.

40|$|The {{methodology}} and principle using vibrational energy transfer to measure molecular distances in liquids are introduced. The {{application of the}} method to the studies of <b>ion</b> pairing and <b>clustering</b> in strong electrolyte aqueous solutions is demonstrated with MSCN aqueous solutions where M = Li, Na, K, Cs, and NH 4. Experiments suggest that ions in the concentrated aqueous solutions can form substantial quantities of <b>ion</b> <b>clusters</b> in which both cations and anions are involved. More and larger clusters form in solutions that are relatively more concentrated and which include a larger cation. In KSCN solutions, the shortest anionic distance in the <b>ion</b> <b>clusters</b> {{is the same as}} that in the KSCN crystal. The rotational time of the anion and the nonresonant vibrational energy transfer time with a gap of 75 cm(- 1) in the KSCN saturated solution are very similar to those in the KSCN crystal. However, the KSCN <b>ion</b> <b>clusters</b> are closer in structure to the melt. The clusters form an interconnected network with random ionic orientations. Because of <b>ion</b> <b>clustering,</b> the anion and water dynamics behave distinctly in the same solutions. At high concentrations, the anion rotation significantly slows down because of the increase {{in the size of the}} <b>ion</b> <b>clusters,</b> but the slowdown amplitude of water rotation is very modest because many of the water molecules still remain in the "bulk" state due to <b>ion</b> <b>clustering.</b> The rotational dynamics of both water and anions are slower in a solution with a smaller cation, primarily because a smaller cation has a stronger cation/anion interaction and a cation/water interaction that leads to more water molecules confined in the <b>ion</b> <b>clusters.</b> Adding <b>ions</b> or molecules into the KSCN solutions can perturb the <b>ion</b> <b>clusters.</b> Weakly hydrated anions can participate in clustering and form mixed <b>ion</b> <b>clusters</b> with KSCN, and strongly hydrated anions can reduce the effective water molecules solvating KSCN and facilitate the formation of more and larger KSCN <b>ion</b> <b>clusters.</b> Similarly, molecules which can strongly bind to SCN- prefer to participate in the KSCN <b>ion</b> <b>clusters.</b> Molecules which are strongly hydrated prefer to remain hydrated and facilitate the <b>ion</b> <b>clustering</b> of KSCN...|$|R

50|$|A sample {{dechlorination}} of chlorinated {{aliphatic hydrocarbons}} (CAHs) such as tetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene or PCE) by Dehalococcoides ethenogenes has been illustrated above. PCE {{is one of}} the highly chlorinated CAHs with no known microorganisms capable of aerobic degradation. The high electronegative character of PCE renders oxidizing agent capabilities through accepting electrons by co-metabolism or dehalorespiration. In a co-metabolism, the reduction of PCE is made feasible by the utilization of a primary metabolite for carbon and energy source. In dehalorespiration, the electron transfer from oxidation of small molecules (H2 is the major source; but, glucose, acetate, formate, and methanol can also be used) to PCE generates energy required for the bacterial growth. The hydrogen involved in this mechanism is often a product of another process such as fermentation of simple molecules like sugars or other complex molecules like fatty acids. Moreover, due to competition from methanogens for H2, low H2 concentrations are favored by dechlorinating bacteria, and is often established through slow-release fermentation compounds such as fatty acids and decaying bacterial biomass. While several enzymes and electron carriers are involved in process, two enzymes perform the dechlorination reactions-PCE reductive dehydrogenase (PCE-RDase) and TCE reductive dehydrogenase (TCE-RDase). The PCE-RDase is normally found freely in cytoplasm while the TCE-RDase is found attached to the exterior cytoplasmic membrane. These enzymes normally utilize a metal <b>ion</b> <b>cluster</b> like Fe-S cluster to complete electron transfer cycle. Hydrogen is oxidized to generate two protons and two electrons. The removal of first chloride, which is performed by PCE-RDase, reduces PCE into TCE by reductive dehalogenation, where a hydride replaces the chlorine. The chloride lost from PCE gains the two electrons and the proton that accompanies them to form HCl. TCE can be reduced to cis-dichloroethene (cis-DCE) by either PCE-RDase or TCE-RDase. Subsequent reductions to vinyl chloride (VC) and ethene are performed by TCE-RDase. The dechlorination of PCE to cis-DCE is faster and thermodynamically more favorable than dechlorination of cis-DCE to VC. The transformation of VC to ethene is the slowest step of the process and hence limits the overall rate of the reaction. The rate of reductive dechlorination is also directly correlated with the number of chlorine atoms, and as such, it decreases with a decreasing number of chlorine atoms. In addition, while several groups of bacteria such as Desulfomonile, Dehalobacter, Desulfuromonas...etc. can perform the dehalogenation of PCE to TCE, only the Dehalococcoides group can perform the complete reductive dechlorination from PCE to ethene.|$|E

40|$|A {{model for}} the {{formation}} and stabilization of charged water clathrates is presented which accounts for observed anomalies in H(+) (H 2 O) n ion distributions. These anomalies are observed in both <b>ion</b> <b>cluster</b> and neutral expansions and {{are consistent with the}} sizes expected for clathrate ions. That the same sizes are observed in both <b>ion</b> <b>cluster</b> and neutral expansions strongly suggests that a rapid ionic process is responsible for their formation. The proposed model is based on the high mobility and bonding effects of the excess proton in water. Computer simulations suggest that excess proton movement in a water clathrate would be suitable for stabilizing the clathrate structure as well as giving it access to a large number of nearly degenerate proton configurations. The formation of clathrates in charged water clusters of proper size can be ascribed to the following: rapid excess proton movement, a strong preference of the H 3 O(+) for a three-coordinate bonding structure (which is compatible with hydrogen bonding), and finally, relatively slow processes leading to thermal disorder...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} supplementary {{technique for}} ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) is mass spectrometry (MS).

40|$|ABSTRACT: In general, intermolecular {{distances}} in condensed phases at the angstrom {{scale are}} difficult to measure. We {{were able to do}} so by using the vibrational energy transfer method, an ultrafast vibrational analogue of Förster resonance energy transfer. The distances among SCN − anions in KSCN crystals and <b>ion</b> <b>clusters</b> of KSCN aqueous solutions were determined with the method. In the crystalline samples, the closest anion distance was determined to be 3. 9 ± 0. 3 Å, consistent with the XRD result. In the 1. 8 and 1 M KSCN aqueous solutions, the anion distances in the <b>ion</b> <b>clusters</b> were determined to be 4. 4 ± 0. 4 Å. The clustered anion distances in aqueous solutions are very similar to the closest anion distance in the KSCN crystal but significantly shorter than the average anion distance (0. 94 − 1. 17 nm) in the aqueous solutions if <b>ion</b> <b>clustering</b> did not occur.

The NMR solution structure of TmCsp from Thermotoga maritima, the hyperthermophilic member of this class of proteins, was solved on the basis of 1015 conformational constraints. It contains five beta strands combined in two antiparallel beta sheets making up a beta barrel structure, in which beta strands 1 - 4 are arranged in a Greek-key topology. The side chain of R 2, which is exclusively found in thermophilic members of the Csp family, probably participates in a peripheral <b>ion</b> <b>cluster</b> involving residues D 20, R 2, E 47 and K 63, suggesting that the thermostability of TmCsp is based on the peripheral <b>ion</b> <b>cluster</b> around the side chain of R 2...|$|E

40|$|Waiting time {{dependent}} rotational anisotropies of SCN- anions {{and water}} molecules in alkali thiocyanate (XSCN, X = Li, Na, K, Cs) aqueous solutions at various concentrations were measured with ultrafast infrared spectroscopy. It {{was found that}} cations can significantly affect the reorientational motions of both water molecules and SCN- anions. The dynamics are slower in a solution with a smaller cation. The reorientational time constants follow the order of Li+ > Na+ > K+ similar or equal to Cs+. The changes of rotational time constants of SCN- at various concentrations scale almost linearly with the changes of solution viscosity, but those of water molecules do not. In addition, the concentration-dependent amplitudes of dynamical changes are much more significant in the Li+ and Na+ solutions {{than those in the}} K+ and Cs+ solutions. Further investigations on the systems with the ultrafast vibrational energy exchange method and molecular dynamics simulations provide an explanation for the observations: the observed rotational dynamics are the balanced results of <b>ion</b> <b>clustering</b> and cation/anion/water direct interactions. In all the solutions at high concentrations (> 5 M), substantial amounts of <b>ions</b> form <b>clusters.</b> The structural inhomogeneity in the solutions leads to distinct rotational dynamics of water and anions. The strong interactions of Li+ and Na+ because of their relatively large charge densities with water molecules and SCN- anions, in addition to the likely geometric confinements because of <b>ion</b> <b>clustering,</b> substantially slow down the rotations of SCN- anions and water molecules inside the <b>ion</b> <b>clusters.</b> The interactions of K+ and Cs+ with water or SCN- are much weaker. The rotations of water molecules inside <b>ion</b> <b>clusters</b> of K+ and Cs+ solutions are not significantly different from those of other water species so that the experimentally observed rotational relaxation dynamics are only slightly affected by the ion concentrations...|$|R

40|$|In {{a recent}} paper V. I. Krassovsky (1958) predicts the {{occurrence}} of clusters {{of large numbers of}} atoms and molecules around ions in the interstellar gas. He then proposes a number of physicochemical processes that would be considerably enhanced by the high particle density in such clusters. In particular, he suggests that absorption by negative ions formed in the clusters would account for the interstellar extinction without any necessity for the presence of grains. Because of the important consequences that <b>ion</b> <b>clusters</b> could have, it is necessary to examine their occurrence more fully.

The evolution of the aerosol size distribution and the chemical composition change is simulated using a previously developed quasi one-dimensional flow field model with coupled gas phase kinetics, aerosol nucleation, condensation, and coagulation processes. An increased abundance of the aerosol precursors SO 3, HSO 3, and H 2 SO 4 at the nozzle exit leads to an increased number of larger volatile aerosol particles, with diameter › 5 and 9 nm, than previously measured in aircraft exhaust plumes. Most of the gaseous H 2 SO 4 gets converted to liquid aerosol particles within about 1 s.

SAWNUC (Sulphuric Acid Water Nucleation) is a model of binary nucleation that is based on laboratory measurements of the binding energies of sulphuric acid and water in charged and neutral clusters. Predictions of SAWNUC are compared for the first time comprehensively with experimental binary nucleation data from the CLOUD chamber at European Organization for Nuclear Research. The experimental measurements span a temperature range of 208 – 292 K, sulphuric acid concentrations from 1 · 106 to 1 · 109 cm− 3, and distinguish between ion-induced and neutral nucleation. Good agreement, within a factor of 5, is found between the experimental and modeled formation rates for ion-induced nucleation at 278 K and below and for neutral nucleation at 208 and 223 K. Differences at warm temperatures are attributed to ammonia contamination which was indicated by the presence of ammonia-sulphuric acid clusters, detected by an Atmospheric Pressure Interface Time of Flight (APi-TOF) mass spectrometer. APi-TOF measurements of the sulphuric acid <b>ion</b> <b>cluster</b> distributions (math formula with i = 0, 1, [...] ., 10) show qualitative agreement with the SAWNUC <b>ion</b> <b>cluster</b> distributions.
