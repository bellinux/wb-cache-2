25|$|The {{treatise}} {{often makes}} {{references to the}} Bible and Aristotelian thought, and it is heavily influenced by the philosophical tenets of Neoplatonism. The first section of the book's main text is written using the scholastic methodology of Thomas Aquinas characterized by a mode of disputed questions most notably used in his Summa Theologica. It was a standard mode of argumentation in scholastic discourse with a long tradition. Most of the citations in the Malleus come from multiple works of Aquinas, a highly influential author in theology. Aquinas is a main source for Section I but is cited in all sections; Formicarius by Johannes Nider <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>important</b> source for Section II, and Directorium Inquisitorum by Spanish inquisitor Nicholas Eymeric is a crucial source for Section III.|$|E
25|$|In {{temperate}} softwoods, there {{often is}} a marked difference between latewood and earlywood. The latewood will be denser than that formed {{early in the}} season. When examined under a microscope, the cells of dense latewood are seen to be very thick-walled and with very small cell cavities, while those formed first in the season have thin walls and large cell cavities. The strength is in the walls, not the cavities. Hence the greater the proportion of latewood, the greater the density and strength. In choosing a piece of pine where strength or stiffness <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>important</b> consideration, the principal thing to observe is the comparative amounts of earlywood and latewood. The width of ring is not nearly so important as the proportion {{and nature of the}} latewood in the ring.|$|E
25|$|Solapur is a {{city with}} multi-linguistic and multi-cultural features. Solapur has a mixture of Marathi and Kannada speakers. The festival of Makar Sankranti {{is one of the}} largest festivals celebrated by the Lingayat {{community}} in Solapur. The Nandidhwaj rally and their marriage <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>important</b> part of the festival. The Nandidhwaj rally goes through the 68 temples of Lord shiv which are situated in different parts of the city. Gadda yatra is another important part of this festival. It is a fair which is organised on Hom Maidan. Along with Makar Sankranti people also celebrate Shiv Jayanti, Gudipadwa, Diwali, Ganesh Chaturthi and some more.

Since 1951, more than 1100 pieces of birch bark with writing on it have been found, and more are dug up every summer. The term beresty, denoting such birch bark manuscripts, is a plural form of beresta ("birch bark"), {{and the study of}} beresty is called berestologija. The great amount of beresty is indicative of a high rate of literacy among the population, as is the large number of styluses.|$|E
2500|$|Wireless power {{uses the}} same fields and waves as {{wireless}} communication devices like radio, another familiar technology that involves electrical energy transmitted without wires by electromagnetic fields, used in cellphones, radio and television broadcasting, and WiFi. [...] In radio communication the goal is the transmission of information, so the amount of power reaching the receiver is not so important, {{as long as it}} is sufficient that the information can be received intelligibly. [...] In wireless communication technologies only tiny amounts of power reach the receiver. [...] In contrast, with wireless power the amount of energy received <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>important</b> thing, so the efficiency (fraction of transmitted energy that is received) is the more significant parameter. [...] For this reason, wireless power technologies are likely to be more limited by distance than wireless communication technologies.|$|E

2500|$|Brody Costa et al. {{suggest that}} women's vaginal orgasm {{consistency}} {{is associated with}} being told in childhood or adolescence that the vagina <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>important</b> zone for inducing female orgasm. Other proposed factors include how well women focus mentally on vaginal sensations during penile-vaginal intercourse, the greater duration of intercourse, and preference for above-average penis length. Costa theorizes that vaginal orgasm is more prevalent among women with a prominent tubercle of the upper lip. His research indicates that [...] " [...] prominent and sharply raised lip tubercle {{has been associated with}} greater odds (odds ratio = 12.3) of ever having a vaginal orgasm, and also with greater past month vaginal orgasm consistency (an effect driven by the women who never had a vaginal orgasm), than less prominent lip tubercle categories." [...] However, lip tubercle was not associated with social desirability responding, or with orgasm triggered by masturbation during penile-vaginal sex, solitary or partner clitoral or vaginal masturbation, vibrator, or cunnilingus.|$|E
