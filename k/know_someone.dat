This recitation is printed on the inside back cover of the original 1927 sheet music, and is sung on Stanley Kirbys recording in 1928, Al Jolson's recording in 1949 and Blue Barrron recording in 1950 (US top 20 hit).

500|$|Homer Simpson {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{influential}} television characters by a variety of standards. USA Today cited the character as being one of the [...] "top 25 most influential people of the past 25 years" [...] in 2007, adding that Homer [...] "epitomized the irony and irreverence at the core of American humor." [...] Robert Thompson, director of Syracuse University's Center for the Study of Popular Television believes that [...] "three centuries from now, English professors are going to be regarding Homer Simpson as one of the greatest creations in human storytelling." [...] Animation historian Jerry Beck described Homer as one of the best animated characters, saying, [...] "you <b>know</b> <b>someone</b> like it, or you identify with (it). That's really the key to a classic character." [...] Homer has been described by The Sunday Times as [...] "the greatest comic creation of [...] time". The article remarked, [...] "every age needs its great, consoling failure, its lovable, pretension-free mediocrity. And we have ours in Homer Simpson." ...|$|E

500|$|Muhney {{said in an}} {{interview}} that the plot point of seducing Rafe broadened Adam's horizons. He said, [...] "What it did was move a character who represents a person who lives in Genoa City and moved him outside of a box that you can neatly check off. 'He is straight, he is this, or he is that,' and the fact that some lines are blurred makes him more real. When they did that with this character, I loved the opportunity to play into a different realm which is usually not touched upon on television." [...] Muhney described the character as a [...] "puppeteer" [...] with [...] "survival instinct", but also someone with a conscience. In another interview, when asked what he likes about portraying Adam, Muhney stated: [...] "You want to play a catalytic character. You know a troublemaker is good business. You <b>know</b> <b>someone</b> who doesn't swim with the fishes, who swims upstream in the other direction, is someone who is going to cause friction and turbulence in storyline with other characters. I have been told by many of my cast members that the role to play is Adam. They say, [...] "If I were to have a choice, the character I would want to play is your role, Adam." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to Michael Buffer, the American boxing promoter Don King is featured prominently in [...] "Damien" [...] as Satan's promoter.

It's definitely nothing personal." [...] Nancy Kerrigan, the Olympic figure skater attacked on orders of fellow skater Tonya Harding at the 1994 Winter Olympics, is referred to in a pep talk Stan gives Jesus. Stan wrongfully claims Kerrigan won the gold medal until Kyle reminds him she won the silver; Parker said this was done because he felt the perception of Kerrigan was extremely high among Americans considering she only actually achieved second place. During that same pep talk, Stan tells Jesus, [...] "You <b>know,</b> <b>someone</b> once said, 'Don't try to be a great man, just be a man.'" [...] Although Stan says this was a quote from Jesus himself, it was actually a line from the 1996 film, [...] [...] "Damien" [...] also includes a reference to singer Nancy Sinatra, the daughter of legendary crooner Frank Sinatra. Mr. Garrison, while discussing great singers of the baroque period, {{goes on to say that}} [...] "Nancy Sinatra was quite a choice piece of ass".|$|E

Nick recorded his new record at my studio, and then he was going to drop off some records and he said, 'Hey, need anyone to sing backup?' And I was like, 'Actually, yeah, come on in.'

[...] During this time, Homme sank into a deep depression, noting [...] "I would never say, 'I'm probably not gonna make it out of here.' But back then, I would definitely think it." [...] The remaining members of Queens of the Stone Age— guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen, drummer Joey Castillo, bassist Michael Shuman and guitarist and keyboardist Dean Fertita – encouraged Homme to return to the band to begin work on a sixth studio album.

2500|$|A 1994 {{article in}} the Journal of Naturopathic Medicine {{followed}} 39 patients treated with Hoxsey Therapy in Tijuana. Patient interviews were used to confirm the existence and stage of cancer; some of the patients were unaware of the stage of their tumor {{and in some cases}} medical records were not available. Most patients were lost to follow-up; of the patients successfully followed who claimed to use the formula, 9 died and 6 were alive. The 6 survivors all claimed by mailed responses to questionnaires to be disease-free after five years of follow-up. Review of this study pointed out its [...] "obvious flaws", including [...] "the majority of patients lost to follow-up, lack of access to detailed medical records, and reliance upon patients for disease stage information"; the authors themselves regarded the results as unclear. These same authors interviewed patients at other alternative cancer clinics in Mexico. Not one patient at these other clinics claimed that they personally knew anyone who had attended those clinics and had been cured of cancer (or anything else). As a curious anecdote, every one of the 39 patients attending the Hoxsey clinic (the [...] "Bio-medical Center") claimed to personally <b>know</b> <b>someone</b> who was diagnosed with cancer in North America, came to the Hoxsey clinic, and claimed to be cured of their cancer.|$|E
2500|$|Richie {{said that}} about halfway through the reveal episode, Alfie [...] "resigns himself {{to the fact that}} it's over between Kat and Alfie, there is no going back", and said that Neilson said halfway through the 15-minute scene that Alfie would be thinking, [...] "I {{understand}} you've done this with somebody... We can get over this... What do you mean... it's been going on for months? We can get over it, because I know you don't love him... What, you love this guy? It's someone we <b>know?</b> <b>Someone</b> in the pub...?", and said that Alfie needs to know who it is for his own peace of mind, though [...] "his whole life just crumbles in his hands". Richie said that viewers would be surprised by the final reveal, stating that [...] "it's really interesting about how we play the Branning card as to which one of them it is. The way it's worded, you believe it's one brother in particular and then that all changes and you go, 'oh it's him!' Because we make people believe it's another Branning—the way its worded, the way I face up to one of them. The audience will all think it's one person in particular, but then I throw a curve ball and it all kicks off. It's great." [...] Richie said that Alfie cannot understand why Kat is having an affair with Derek, which [...] "makes him sick". He also stated that viewers would find out in January 2013 why Kat had the affair with the person she did. He said: [...] "It's an ongoing story, which is really interesting, to see why Kat was with Alfie and why she went for this bloke because they both offer her different things." [...] Richie speculated that the reason Kat had an affair with Derek is [...] "because Derek is the total polar opposite of Alfie" [...] and Kat is [...] "attracted to danger", which is not like Alfie, and Kat is [...] "used to danger, she's used to excitement. What she got from Alfie was the fairytale, what she wanted was the nightmare". However, the reasons for Kat having the affair were never explained on screen.|$|E

40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that public attitudes towards AIDS {{and the safety}} of health care in the era of HIV would be more positive for people who <b>knew</b> <b>someone</b> with AIDS. We believed, moreover, that living in areas with high AIDS prevalence would result in more favorable attitudes. To test these hypotheses, we conducted telephone interviews with a random sample of 2000 U. S. adults (response RATE = 75 %) in summer 1988. Overall 19. 5 % of respondents said that they <b>knew</b> <b>someone</b> with AIDS or the AIDS virus. Thirteen percent of people who lived in low prevalence areas reported knowing someone with AIDS, compared with 27 % of those in areas of high prevalence. Of the total sample, 38 % reported knowing someone they believed was at risk. People who <b>knew</b> <b>someone</b> with AIDS were less likely to say they would change physicians or dentists if their provider was HIV infected or was known to be treating people who were infected. <b>Knowing</b> <b>someone</b> with AIDS was also associated with greater tolerance for those with AIDS to continue to work if they were able and with lower perception of risk of transmission in health care settings. Multivariate regression analyses indicated that personal contact was related to more positive attitudes. Counter to our hypothesis, living in a high prevalence area had no independent effect on attitudes. This surprising finding suggests that, after controlling for personal contact with someone with AIDS, where one lives does not influence attitudes. Because bringing people with AIDS into contact with others may have positive outcomes, we suggest implementation of interventions using this strategy. AIDS attitudes health care survey...|$|R
