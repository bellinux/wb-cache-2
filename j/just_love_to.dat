500|$|Early in the 2007 playoffs, Selänne became Anaheim's all-time leading playoff scorer when he {{recorded}} his 30th point as a Duck with an assist on April 13 against the Minnesota Wild. The Ducks defeated the Wild, Vancouver Canucks and Detroit Red Wings {{to reach the}} Final; {{it was the first}} time in Selänne's career that he played in the NHL's championship series. As the sentimental favourite to win the Stanley Cup, his teammates motivated themselves to win the title for his benefit; Ducks goaltender Jean-Sébastien Giguère noted, [...] "We don't have any better teammate. He's a guy who always has fun. He deserves this and if we can help him along the way, that would be great. I'd <b>just</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> see Teemu win this thing." [...] Selänne finished the playoffs with 15 points in 21 games, and after 14 NHL seasons, the 36-year-old Selänne raised the Stanley Cup with his teammates after defeating the Ottawa Senators in five games.|$|E
500|$|Others {{were more}} {{tempered}} in their praise. James Poniewozik of Time said the episode was [...] "grounded" [...] and [...] "solid-if-not-spectacular", and highlighted how Glee [...] "has {{developed into a}} broad ensemble, where any of several characters is capable of taking the spotlight, even an originally comic-relief character like Brittany." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club and the Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson both liked the episode—VanDerWerff gave it a [...] "B+"—but they, like Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone who was less complimentary, were disappointed that it failed to measure {{up to the last}} time New Directions competed in Sectionals. VanDerWerff wrote, [...] "When the show [...] remains, at some level, a show about a bunch of kids who <b>just</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> sing and dance and maybe have wacky adventures on the side, it remains fundamentally strong, as it does tonight." [...] He also stated, [...] "The fact that the Warblers and New Directions tied, while probably necessary for whatever reason, is ridiculously anticlimactic and keeps this episode from an A- pretty much singlehandedly." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Nick {{is only a}} semi-regular character, his {{intermittent}} appearances {{were always}} scripted {{to make a big}} impact on the show, as well as all the characters involved in his storylines. He reappeared and left several times during {{the first few years of}} the show, causing maximum havoc every time, and it wasn't long before the tabloids had begun to brand the character [...] "Nasty Nick". Altman has commented: [...] "I think they keep bringing Nick back because he's one of the characters on British TV that people <b>just</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> hate". This dislike of the character by the public was shared by the fictional residents of Walford, with Altman explaining: [...] "Every time he comes back he gets shunned by one and all. It's like being the bad cowboy come riding into town - everybody puts down the shutters and locks up the bar." [...] The character's appearance was tailored to suit this unlikable, [...] "nasty" [...] image, with EastEnders series consultant Simon Ashdown commenting; [...] "When he comes on, you know this guy is bad. He's got the black hair and the scowl and the leather jacket. He is like that, he is a Dickensian baddy." [...] Frankie Fitzgerald, who played Nick's son Ashley Cotton from 2000 to 2001, agreed: [...] "The look of Nasty Nick, you know, he was a bad guy. Even when he gets dressed up in a suit, he's still got the earring, he's still got the rings, he's still got the tattoo on his neck." ...|$|E
