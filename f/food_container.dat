25|$|The concept itself {{consisted}} of pre-packed meals or snacks — usually, Spam salads out and sandwiches back — loaded into a small, two-shelf compartment {{in the seat}} back {{in front of each}} passenger. The meal/snack for the outbound journey could be found in the top compartment, the one for the return trip in the lower section. The latter contained a pellet of dry ice placed under the plastic <b>food</b> <b>container.</b> This simple refrigeration technique prevented food for the return trip that would spend several hours inside a small, confined space from going off. For the airline's cabin staff, it eliminated handling trays while airborne and resulted in a reduction of their workload. To prevent outbound passengers from consuming meals intended for return passengers, locks needed to be installed on the lower compartment that could only be opened by cabin staff during the aircraft's turnaround at the destination airport (although these were not always effective at deterring determined passengers).|$|E

25|$|In 1987, Berkeley, California banned CFC <b>food</b> <b>containers.</b> The {{following}} year, Suffolk County, New York {{became the}} first U.S. locality to ban polystyrene. However, legal challenges by the Society of the Plastics Industry kept it from going into effect until at last it was delayed when the Republican and Conservative parties became {{a majority of the}} county legislature. In the meantime, Berkeley {{became the first}} city to ban all foam <b>food</b> <b>containers.</b> As of 2006, about one hundred localities in the United States including Portland, Oregon and San Francisco currently have some sort of ban on polystyrene foam in restaurants. For instance, in 2007 Oakland, California required restaurants to switch to disposable <b>food</b> <b>containers</b> that will biodegrade if added to food compost. In 2013, San Jose became reportedly the largest city in the country to ban polystyrene foam <b>food</b> <b>containers.</b> Some communities have implemented wide polystyrene bans, such as Freeport, Maine, which did so in 1990.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the migration of chemicals from products and <b>food</b> <b>containers</b> into <b>food</b> and determine the health issues of those chemicals. The study was made to help make a risk assessment of the chemicals that migrate from the products and <b>food</b> <b>containers.</b> The study was done by researching the internet and books and having interviews with suppliers, producers and resellers of the containers by e-mail or over the phone. The different materials in the food packages and products that were researched had different chemicals that were added to give the material a certain property such as colour, density and flame resistance. The result shows that a lot of our products and <b>food</b> <b>containers</b> contain a variety of chemicals. Some of the chemicals proved to be in direct correlation with the health issues of our hormone- and reproductive systems and others had a direct effect on our bigger organs. The plastic <b>food</b> <b>containers</b> and products proved to have the most additives and health issues from the added chemicals compared to the other materials. The risk assessment that was made ranged from 1 to 4 in which 1 is an indication that the material and/or chemical is toxic, a 2 indicates that it is not sure whether or not the material and/or chemical is toxic, a 3 indicates that the material and/or chemical is not toxic and a 4 indicates that more studies have to be done to be sure of the materials and/or chemicals toxicity...|$|R
