5|$|The long-running HUG process {{complicated}} the RAAF's management of its fleet of F/A-18s. At any one time, {{the capabilities of}} <b>individual</b> <b>aircraft</b> differed considerably depending on their upgrades. Accordingly, the long-standing arrangement where aircraft were almost permanently assigned to each squadron {{was replaced by a}} system where they were pooled. Attempts to allocate Hornets with similar levels of modifications from the common pool to each squadron were not successful.|$|E
5|$|On October 14, 1990, United Airlines {{became the}} 777's launch {{customer}} when it placed {{an order for}} 34 Pratt & Whitney-powered aircraft valued at US$11billion with options on an additional 34. The development phase coincided with United's replacement program for its aging DC-10s. United required that the new aircraft be capable of flying three different routes: Chicago to Hawaii, Chicago to Europe, and non-stop from Denver, a hot and high airport, to Hawaii. ETOPS certification was also a priority for United, given the overwater portion of United's Hawaii routes. In January 1993, a team of United developers joined other airline teams and Boeing designers at the Everett factory. The 240 design teams, with up to 40 members each, addressed almost 1,500 design issues with <b>individual</b> <b>aircraft</b> components. The fuselage diameter was increased to suit Cathay Pacific, the baseline model grew longer for All Nippon Airways, and British Airways' input led to added built-in testing and interior flexibility, along with higher operating weight options.|$|E
25|$|In 1954 the Belgian Army formed its own {{aviation}} element and {{serial numbers}} were allocated {{in the form}} OL-A01, the OL for Observation Leger (light observation), the letter for the type and the number for each <b>individual</b> <b>aircraft.</b> In 1974 the OL prefix was dropped.|$|E
40|$|This Bachelor thesis {{considers}} ultra-light aircrafts. The main {{subjects are}} an interpretation clause of these aircrafts, their delimitation {{in terms of}} law and a development of European standards relating to these ultra-light aircrafts. Furthermore there is considered their construction and materials used for their building and an impact of these materials on aircrafts´s qualities. At the end all the <b>individual</b> <b>aircrafts</b> are compared in their efficiency and ergonomy...|$|R

5000|$|... 24 March 1944: VP-216 {{transferred}} {{aircraft and}} personnel in three-aircraft elements to NAS Alameda, California, via MCAS Eagle Mountain Lake, Texas, and NAS San Diego, California. “How goes it” curves were developed on each aircraft, enabling {{the crew to}} determine each <b>individual</b> <b>aircraft’s</b> capabilities for the forthcoming trans-Pacific flight to Hawaii. The curve was a plot of speed, distance, engine settings, remaining fuel, etc., that assisted the crew in assessing the crucial “point of no return” for the over-water transit to NAS Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii.|$|R
25|$|Most virtual {{airlines}} {{have a specific}} ranking system for their pilots, that tend to involve restricting which airplanes the member is allowed to fly. Pilots complete flights for their airline, using their simulator, either online (using a network such as VATSIM) or offline, and then file a pilot report. A key aspect of these pilot reports is logging {{the number of hours}} flown, which directly affects the members promotion to other ranks. Ranking systems used typically use terminology associated with commercial aviation, such as designating senior pilots as captain. Commercial aircraft have flight crew consisting of several people, whereas in flight simulation it is rare for <b>individual</b> <b>aircraft</b> to have more than one person piloting it, therefore rank distinctions are focused on the members efforts within the organization rather than their seniority on board an <b>individual</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|E
25|$|When the Belgian Air Force was re-formed in 1946 <b>individual</b> <b>aircraft</b> were {{allocated}} {{serial numbers}} {{in either a}} one or two letter prefix followed by a one or two digit number. The first allocations were mainly single letters (for example A-1 was an Auster AOP.6) but sometimes a second letter was used to distinguish variants, for example NA-1 was an Avro Anson I and NB-1 was an Anson II.|$|E
25|$|The RAF Museum {{preserves}} {{a number}} of <b>individual</b> <b>aircraft</b> which were based at RAF Andover during their service lives: a Sikorsky R-4B Hoverfly I; an Avro Anson C. 19; a De Havilland Dove C. 1; a Percival Pembroke C. 2; and, unusually, two Luftwaffe aircraft captured in 1944, a Junkers Ju 87 G-2 dive bomber and a Messerschmitt Bf 110 G-4 night fighter. The National Museum of Flight in Scotland preserves RAF Andover's former gate guardian, a Supermarine Spitfire LF Mk. XVIE.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} interrogates {{the ground}} transponder {{with a series}} of pulse-pairs (interrogations) and, after a precise time delay (typically 50 microseconds), the ground station replies with an identical sequence of pulse-pairs. The DME receiver in the aircraft searches for reply pulse-pairs (X-mode= 12 microsecond spacing) with the correct interval and reply pattern to its original interrogation pattern. (Pulse-pairs that are not coincident with the <b>individual</b> <b>aircraft's</b> interrogation pattern e.g. not synchronous, are referred to as filler pulse-pairs, or squitter. Also, replies to other aircraft that are therefore non-synchronous also appear as squitter).|$|R
40|$|Increasing CO 2 {{emissions}} and associated fuel {{consumption of the}} world’s aircraft fleet are a serious threat for both the world climate and the profitability of commercial aviation. CO 2 emission can be analyzed on the local – i. e. single aircraft – and global – i. e. world fleet – level. Methods to reduce CO 2 on the former are identified and the consequent future evolution of global CO 2 is estimated. A method is developed and applied to assess the future fleet built-up through 2036. New aircraft {{programs as well as}} phase-out of inservice <b>aircraft</b> are considered. <b>Individual</b> <b>aircraft’s</b> projected fuel efficiency and operational characteristics are introduced to assess the overall fleet’s CO 2 emission development over the considered time frame. Three scenarios are assumed to show the effect of different rates of technology progress in terms of fleetwide aircraft fuel efficiency. Besides the <b>individual</b> <b>aircraft‘s</b> technological advances, further measures to reduce CO 2 emissions on a fleet level are analyzed: Bio fuels, shorter aircraft program cycles and shorter aircraft life. It is shown that the sole aircraft-related technology improvements will not be sufficient to reach such goals as ‘carbon neutral growth’ due to a constantly high traffic growth rate. Bio fuels seem to be the only solution for this problem, however, this technology is still immature and thus subject of high uncertainty in terms of economic viability as well as net-carbon footprint...|$|R
50|$|News of {{the device}} {{made its way to}} England, where some level of panic broke out when it was {{suggested}} that the H2S could be leading to the aircraft's demise. Arguments over the use of H2S by bomber command started anew. These were finally put to rest in July 1944 when a Naxos-equipped Ju 88 night fighter became lost and landed in the UK. The crew described the operation of Naxos as being of little overall use, while another device, Flensburg was able to home in on <b>individual</b> <b>aircraft's</b> Monica radar. Monica was removed from service and H2S was allowed to continue throughout the war.|$|R
25|$|In April 2017 Cirrus {{stated that}} it plans to deliver between 25 and 50 {{aircraft}} in 2017 and between 75 and 125 in 2018. The company was awarded a production certificate on 2 May 2017, which allows aircraft production without FAA inspection of each <b>individual</b> <b>aircraft</b> and allows the company to produce {{a larger number of}} aircraft more quickly. As 15% of its 600 orders are intended for the European market, Cirrus received EASA certification at the May 2017 EBACE.|$|E
25|$|Although {{their numbers}} {{gradually}} began to dwindle, C-46s continued {{to operate in}} remote locations, and {{could be seen in}} service from Canada and Alaska to Africa and South America. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Canadian airline Lamb Air operated several C-46s from their bases in Thompson and Churchill, Manitoba. One of the largest C-46 operators was Air Manitoba, whose fleet of aircraft featured gaudy color schemes for <b>individual</b> <b>aircraft.</b> In the 1990s, these aircraft were divested to other owner/operators.|$|E
25|$|Later in the war, the Allied bomber {{offensive}} sometimes took US or British bombers into Swiss airspace, either damaged craft seeking {{safe haven}} or even on occasions bombing Swiss cities by accident. Swiss aircraft {{would attempt to}} intercept <b>individual</b> <b>aircraft</b> and force them to land, interning the crews. Only one further Swiss pilot was killed during the war, shot down by a US fighter in September 1944. From September red and white neutrality bands {{were added to the}} wings of aircraft to stop accidental attacks on Swiss aircraft by Allied aircraft.|$|E

5000|$|When a German {{military}} aircraft emerged from its production plant, {{it was given}} a four-letter Stammkennzeichen code (factory radio code), which was an <b>individual</b> <b>aircraft's</b> radio code before it entered service and staying with the aircraft throughout its entire existence. This format was also usually used for prototype aircraft {{if they did not}} bear a German national [...] "D-xxxx" [...] style civil registration. The entire Stammkennzeichen was usually on the fuselage sides, and also often repeated on the undersides of both wings, with the four letters spread out along the entire wing's under-surfaces. The code could also be placed on such things as the manufacturer's identification plate, and sometimes even the compass correction card for a particular aircraft.|$|R

25|$|After {{experiencing}} several 'Window attacks', the Luftwaffe {{started to}} change its tactics. With radar neutralised by Window, German night fighters {{found it difficult to}} intercept the bombers. However, German ground controllers no longer used radar sets to guide German fighters and track individual enemy bombers in order to intercept. Instead, they gave a running commentary on the stream as a whole. No <b>individual</b> <b>aircraft</b> were tracked unless caught in searchlights. These changes did not produce immediate success, but pointed the way to a method of loosely controlled cat's eye interception. The success of the new tactics were indicated in increasing bomber losses.|$|E
25|$|Aircraft KG867 {{carried the}} marking PP-N. PP was the code for 311 Squadron and -N {{identified}} the <b>individual</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Its captain was Pilot Officer Jaroslav Kudláček, a 25-year-old from Chrudim in eastern Bohemia. He had 1,421 flying hours' experience, 512 hours {{of which were}} on four-engined aircraft. Kudláček had got married to a British woman, their first son {{had been born in}} October 1941 and the family was looking forward to the boy's fourth birthday. Kudláček had just returned from the Royal Hospital, Wolverhampton, where Mrs Kudláčková had given birth to their second son about 10 days previously.|$|E
25|$|The RNZAF is {{currently}} {{in the process of}} retiring the Iroquois. The NHIndustries NH90 has been chosen as its replacement, eight active NH90 helicopters plus one spare are being procured. This process was initially expected to be completed by the end of 2013, but was delayed until 2016. <b>Individual</b> <b>aircraft</b> were retired as they reach their next major 'group' servicing intervals; the UH-1H is to be retired as the NH90 fleet is stood up. On 21 May 2015, the remaining UH-1H fleet of six helicopters conducted a final tour of the country ahead of its planned retirement on 1 July. During 49 years of service the type had seen service in areas including the U.K., Southeast Asia, Timor, the Solomon Islands, various South Pacific nations, and the Antarctic.|$|E

5000|$|Each {{element of}} the seal is {{significant}} for its relevance to the ship’s namesake, naval aviation, naval service, and the nation. There are six prominent features of the seal, beginning with the 41 white stars, symbolizing the ship’s namesake (the 41st President). The rays of light that appear on the seal’s horizon represent Bush’s concept of a [...] "thousand points of light", wherein he urged Americans to find meaning and reward by serving a purpose higher than themselves. The graphic depiction of the aircraft carrier reflects the carrier, as both a symbol and instrument of American strength as a force for freedom. Above the carrier are the overhead profiles of a TBM Avenger torpedo bomber (representing Bush's days as a Navy pilot), an F/A-18 Hornet strike fighter, and an F-35C Lightning II, superimposed one upon the other in reverse chronological order of the <b>individual</b> <b>aircraft's</b> service entry date, and in diminishing scale so each outline is contained within that of the newer aircraft.|$|R

25|$|The first F-100D (54–2121) flew on 24 January 1956, piloted by Daniel Darnell. It entered {{service on}} 29 September 1956 with the 405th Fighter Wing at Langley AFB. The {{aircraft}} suffered from reliability {{problems with the}} constant speed drive which provides constant-frequency current to the electrical systems. In fact, the drive was so unreliable that the USAF required it {{to have its own}} oil system to minimize damage in case of failure. Landing gear and brake parachute malfunctions claimed a number of aircraft, and the refueling probes had a tendency to break away during high speed maneuvers. Numerous post-production fixes created such a diversity of capabilities between <b>individual</b> <b>aircraft</b> that, by 1965, around 700 F-100Ds underwent High Wire modifications to standardize the weapon systems. High Wire modifications took 60 days per aircraft at a cost for the entire project of US $150 million. In 1966, the Combat Skyspot program fitted some F-100Ds with an X band radar transmitter to allow for ground-directed bombing in inclement weather or at night.|$|E
25|$|In July 1936, RAF Pembroke Dock {{became part}} of the newly formed Coastal Command and would remain so until it closed down. It was {{assigned}} to No. 15 Group RAF with the headquarters being at Plymouth, but by 1941, 15 Group was assigned to Liverpool and Pembroke Dock {{became part of}} No 19. Group RAF. In 1938, its entry in the Air Force List designated it as belonging to No 16. Group RAF as a reconnaissance base. From 1938 onwards, Short Sunderland aircraft began arriving to replace older aircraft (Short Singapore and Supermarine Stranraer) on 210 and 228 Squadrons. The Sunderland became synonymous with the base and 210 Squadron and was the workhorse during the Second World War. In December 1936, No. 228 Squadron was stood up after having previously been disbanded at RNAS Killingholme. During the decade between 1936 and 1945, 228 Squadron was allocated to RAF Pembroke Dock 5 times, often for short intervals where <b>individual</b> <b>aircraft</b> from the Squadron were detached out to other bases.|$|E
500|$|The aircraft, an Avro 691 Lancastrian 3, {{was built}} as constructor's number 1280 for the Ministry of Supply to carry 13 passengers, and first flew on 27 November 1945.

30|$|Ground vision-aided {{guidance}} {{is demonstrated}} {{as an effective}} approach for runway-mode UAV autonomous landing. Compared with the onboard scheme, the developed ground vision system has the necessary processing power and greater computation capacity and furthermore rids the need for <b>individual</b> <b>aircrafts</b> to carry such equipment. Truth be told, the ground vision system has potential pitfalls as well. It has a limited distance and scope {{to make the first}} catch of flying aircrafts and is limited to weather conditions significantly. Furthermore, the instrument landing system (ILS) has already been around for decades of years and is deployed in almost every airport and manned airplane. That system with incredible accuracy is reported precise enough to allow landings in essentially zero visibility. Generally, its practical application is restricted to commercial passenger airports for the expensive consumption, inconvenient deployment and professional operations. The ground vision-based system can be modularly assembled and practically deployed for low-cost unmanned aircrafts. From the engineering point of view, the ground system can not only be developed as an effective supplement to the ILS in the high-level airports, but also make low-cost substitutes of ILS within specified scenarios.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, an {{innovative}} approach {{of a true}} 3 D image presentation in a space filling, volumetric laser display will be described. The introduced prototype system {{is based on a}} moving target screen that sweeps the display volume. Net result is the optical equivalent of a three-dimensional array of image points illuminated to form a model of the object which occupies a physical space. Wireframe graphics are presented within the display volume which a group of people can walk around and examine simultaneously from nearly any orientation and without any visual aids. Further to the detailed vector scanning mode, a raster scanned system and a combination of both techniques are under development. The volumetric 3 D laser display technology for true reproduction of spatial images can tremendously improve the viewers ability to interpret data and to reliably determine distance, shape and orientation. Possible applications for this development range from air traffic control, where moving blips of light represent <b>individual</b> <b>aircrafts</b> in a true to scale projected airspace of an airport, to various medical applications (e. g. electrocardiography, computer-tomography), to entertainment and education visualization as well as imaging in the field of engineering and Computer Aided Design (CAD) ...|$|R
