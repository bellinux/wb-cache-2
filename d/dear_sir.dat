Then they'd go by Couples, into a Room on the same Floor to be marry'd as they call'd it. The Door at that Room was kept by - Ecclestone to prevent any body from balking their Diversions.|$|E

Ministers of the Gospel could then travel without fear of being stoned or shot and the houses of the Saints would not be entered into in defiance of all good law and order." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stewart who was Gates' {{subordinate}} {{for over}} a year, took his former chief's side in the political struggle between Gates and his rival Philip Schuyler. When Gates assumed command of the Northern Department in August 1777, Stewart wrote him, [...] "You can't Imagine my <b>Dear</b> <b>Sir,</b> the Satisfaction it gives me your being sent back to your proper Command. It is so great a thing, to get the better so Nobly of that petty party, for I can call them by no other Name." [...] In another letter to Gates, he wrote of his fellow Pennsylvanian Anthony Wayne having to dig trenches, [...] "We are throwing up a few works at Wilmington, where Wayne is like a mad bear, it falling to his brigade. I believe he heartily wishes all engineers at the devil." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Dear</b> <b>Sir</b> — Our earnest solicitude for {{the success}} of the Great Southern Rights {{movement}} to secure an immediate release from the overwhelming dangers that imperil our political and social safety, will we trust, be a sufficient apology for the results which we beg to impose on you. [...] The sentiment of the Southern heart is overwhelming in favor of the movement. Light only is wanted that men many see their way clearly and the prayer of every true patriot will eventually be realized. Tennessee will be a unit. Although the time be so very short, this object may yet be accomplished, if a few men only, (the more the better, however) in each county, will devote their entire energies to it during the canvass for Delegates. We earnestly beg your attention, therefore, to the following suggestions: ...|$|E
2500|$|Titles, such as Mr., Mrs., Miss, Dr., Rev., etc., {{are often}} avoided by many Friends. [...] Instead Friends tend to address {{each other by}} first and last name with no title. [...] In many Quaker {{communities}} children address adults by either their first names, or first and last names but with no title, and in many Quaker schools teachers are called {{by their first names}} as well. [...] It is conventional for Friends who do not know each other well, who in non-Quaker circles would address each other with a title, to use first name and last name together, rather than to adopt the more familiar first name only. [...] Friends also tend not to use the appellation sir or madam to refer to someone of whom they do not know the name, instead using the term Friend. [...] In letter-writing, where others might use the phrase <b>Dear</b> <b>Sir</b> or Madam, many Quakers would instead write Dear Friend, and in such letters, rather than finishing yours faithfully would finish either yours in truth or yours in friendship.|$|E

2500|$|As {{early as}} 1816 or 1817, James Greenleaf made known {{to his wife}} his desire to return to Washington, D.C., to live full-time. Ann Greenleaf, however, was unwilling to do so. In an 1817 letter to her friend and trustee, William Tilghman, she wrote: [...] "It would be unkind of me to say to Mr. Greenleaf, that I never shall be {{reconciled}} to a residence in Washington, D.C., and I believe {{that he does not}} suspect that such are my sentiments, but I say to you my <b>dear</b> <b>Sir</b> unhesitatingly, that I dislike Washington... I love retirement, particularly the retirement of Allentown." [...] Nonetheless, Ann accompanied her husband to the District of Columbia for short periods. They spent Christmas 1821 in the city, and during the winter of 1826 they rented a home (owned by William H. Crawford) on 14th Street NW just north of Thomas Circle. They also spent the summer of 1828 in the city, living at Washington House at 222 North Capitol Street. During the first two decades of the new century, Greenleaf continued to repair many of his personal relationships. By 1830, he had reconciled with most of his family. He spent Christmas 1830 at the Washington home of his brother-in-law, William Cranch. During this stay, he also reunited with Noah Webster {{for the first time in}} years.|$|E
