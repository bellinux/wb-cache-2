50|$|Conductivity {{measurement}} is {{a versatile}} tool in process control. The measurement is simple, fast and most advanced sensors require {{only a little}} maintenance. The measured conductivity reading {{can be used to}} make various assumptions on what is happening in the process. In some cases it is possible to develop a model to calculate concentration of the liquid. Concentration of pure liquids can be calculated when the conductivity and temperature is measured. The preset curves for various acids and bases are commercially available. For example, it is possible to measure the concentration of high purity hydrofluoric acid using conductivity based concentration measurement Quhua Fluorchemical, China Valmet Concentration 3300. Benefit of conductivity and temperature based concentration measurement is the superior speed of inline measurement compared to on-line analyzer. Conductivity based concentration measurement has limitations. The concentration-conductivity dependence of most acids and bases is not linear. Conductivity based measurement can’t determine on which side of the peak the measurement is and therefore the measurement is only possible on linear section of the curve. Kraft pulp mills use conductivity based concentration measurement to control alkali additions to various stages of the cook. Conductivity measurement won’t determine the specific amount of alkali components but it is a good indication on the amount of <b>effective</b> <b>alkali</b> (NaOH + ½ Na2S as NaOH or Na2O) or active alkali (NaOH + Na2S as NaOH or Na2O) in the cooking liquor. The composition of the liquor vary in different stages of the cook. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a specific curve to each measurement point or use commercially available products. The high pressure and temperature of cooking process combined with high concentration of alkali components puts a heavy strain on conductivity sensors that are installed in process. The scaling on the electrodes need to be taken into account, otherwise conductivity measurement drifts causing increased calibration and maintenance need.|$|E

40|$|Abstraa- The {{interaction}} of a pyridine-derived dioxa-triaza-macrocycle with divalent first row transition metal cations is discussed. Selected crystal structures and speciation studies are presented together {{with information on}} application to metal extraction and transport. The recovery of metals from sulfide-rich ores by pyrometallurgical processes is regarded as environmentally unsatisfactory due to the accompanying production of sulfur dioxide which leads to an enhanced acidity in rainfall. Particulate matter from smoke effluents can also be dispersed and dispensed onto nearby land and, if toxic, give rise to further problems. Therefore {{it is important to}} establish processes by which metals of interest can be extracted from what are often low-grade ores by an alternative technology. Consequently there has been much interest in the application of hydrometallurgical techniques which involve a leaching process to dissolve the metals followed by solvent extraction processes to separate and recover the metal ions of interest. Solvent extraction has been used as one of the major techniques in the industrial hydrometallurgy of non-ferrous metals, particularly in the recovery of copper, in cobalt-nickel separation and in the concentration of uranium. 1 J Macrocycles, and macrobicyclic, ligands {{have been shown to be}} <b>effective</b> in <b>alkali,</b> and alkaline earth...|$|R

40|$|Bacterial lipopolysaccharides and `O' somatic antigens usually require {{treatment}} with alkali for maximal adsorption on erythrocytes {{in preparation for}} indirect haemagglutination. Although heating enhances sensitizing activity, owing partly to increasing dispersion, it is always less <b>effective</b> than <b>alkali</b> treatment. The presence of a protein component or of the chloroform soluble lipid `A' does not inhibit erythrocyte sensitizing activity and no change in sugar constituents has been detected {{as a result of}} treatment. The specific polysaccharide of Aerobacter aerogenes, which contains no lipid, requires alkali treatment for activity; in this case the effect of alkali is to remove O-acetate (4 per cent).

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{model of a}} batch kraft pulp digester is developed that predicts, ~ priori, the lignin content distribution, the carbohydrate content distribution, and the <b>effective</b> <b>alkali</b> concentration distribution within pulp chips {{as a function of}} cooking time. From this information the kappa number, yield, screen rejects, and kappa number distribution of the pulp are calculated. The model also predicts the bulk phase <b>effective</b> <b>alkali</b> concentration as a function of cooking time. Input to the model are the initial hydroxyl concentration and sulfide concentration, the chip-thickness distribution, the temperature history of the cook, and the chemical composition and density of the species of wood to be pulped. Model predictions are compared with data from pulping experiments in which the reaction rates are kinetically controlled and with experiments in which the diffusion rate restricts the overall reaction rates. In both cases the comparison is good. Model results show that the normalized second moment of the lignin content is a better predictor of rejects than the fiber liberation point. Results also show that in indirect heated batch digesters the inter-chip mass transfer resistence is negligible. The pulping model is coupled with an optimization scheme to find the optimum pulping conditions. One result of the optimization is that an increase in productivity of 19 %can be obtained by optimization of the <b>effective</b> <b>alkali</b> concentration in a kraft cook. The effect of digester temperature gradients on the lignin content distribution of a pulp is shown to be significant, but the effect on screen rejects is negligible.

Burned lime from both dusting and clear periods were collected and separated into fines and granules. The different fractions were slaked and causticized in a synthetic green liquor. The study found that the fines always delivered a lower <b>effective</b> <b>alkali</b> in the resulting white liquor, and that the particle sizes of the lime mud were always larger than those originating from the granules, implying that the fines were sintered harder.

40|$|The {{dissolution}} of NaCl in water {{is one of}} the most common everyday processes, yet it remains poorly understood at the molecular level. Here we report the results of an extensive density functional theory study in which the initial stages of NaCl dissolution have been examined at low water coverages. Our specific approach is to study how the energetic cost of moving an ion or a pair of ions to a less coordinated site at the surface of various NaCl crystals varies with the number of water molecules adsorbed on the surface. This "microsolvation" approach allows us to study the dependence of the defect energies on the number of water molecules in the cluster and thus to establish when and where dissolution becomes favorable. Moreover, this approach allows us to understand the roles of the individual ions and water molecules in the dissolution process. Consistent with previous work we identify a clear preference for {{dissolution of}} Cl ions over Na ions. However, the detailed information obtained here leads to the conclusion that the process is governed by the higher affinity of the water molecules to Na ions than to Cl ions. The Cl ions are released first as this exposes more Na ions at the surface creating favorable adsorption sites for water. We discuss how this mechanism is likely to be <b>effective</b> for other <b>alkali</b> halides...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} {{ion transport}} capacity of wood, i. e., the Effective Capillary Cross Sectional Area (ECCSA), is determined {{in this work}} based on the analogy with {{the relation between the}} electrical conductivities of wood and liquid medium. Wood is treated under different conditions and then the corresponding ECCSAA (<b>effective</b> capillarity under <b>alkali)</b> is estimated from the value obtained in an inert solution at room temperature (ECCSAInert). The difference between radial and tangential ECCSAA-values can be considered similar irrespectively of pH, time, temperature and the presence of sodium sulfide in the treatment liquor. The results show that the degree of removal of native acetyl groups from hardwood O-acetyl-glucuronoxylan is determinant of a physical characteristic, the ECCSAA. A kinetic expression for Eucalyptus wood deacetylation is validated and used to establish the relationship between the acetyl content and ECCSAA in both directions. Fil: Inalbon, Maria Cristina.

40|$|The loaded salts (NaCl, KCl, MgCl₂, and CaCl₂) have {{significantly}} different {{influence on the}} contribution of dehydration and depolymerization reactions to the decomposition of sugar structures during cellulose fast pyrolysis at 325 °C. The structures of salt-loaded celluloses already become cross-linked during heating-up period, {{largely due to the}} enhanced dehydration reactions catalyzed by inorganic species. As stronger Lewis acids, the alkaline earth metal ions (Mg²⁺ and Ca²⁺) are more <b>effective</b> than the <b>alkali</b> metal ions (Na⁺ and K⁺) to catalyze the dehydration reactions of sugar structures, leading to the formation of more cross-linked cellulose for the alkaline earth metal chloride-loaded celluloses. As a result, the majority of Mg and Ca are transformed into water-insoluble forms during the heating-up period, largely reducing the catalytic effects of these species on the dehydration of sugar structures during the subsequent isothermal pyrolysis. Rather, the dehydration of non-sugar structures is enhanced because the catalytic species are already bonded with non-sugar structures. In contrast, the dehydration of sugar structures during the heating-up period is less significant for the NaCl-loaded and KCl-loaded celluloses. The majority of Na and K are water-soluble after the heating-up period so that the dehydration of sugar structures is further enhanced during isothermal pyrolysis. The loaded salts have less influence on the depolymerization reactions. The contribution of depolymerization reactions to sugar conversion is relatively small during the heating-up stage, but increases substantially during isothermal pyrolysis...|$|R
