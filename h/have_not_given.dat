While in command in the war zone, he became mentally exhausted and contracted an unknown disease. Seriously ill, Inhaúma returned to the national capital in early 1869 and died shortly thereafter. Although historical works <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>given</b> much coverage to Inhaúma, some historians regard him among the greatest of the Brazilian navy officers.|$|E

Such simulations may be viewed passively (as in the case of 3D medical animations included via CD-ROM in medical textbook packages) or using interactive controls.

Even when he says he and his party would go with folded hands to people asking them to leave and only raise hands if they refuse, he treads the ground gingerly without naming any community or party per se". On 3 March, at a party function organised by the MNS at Shivaji Park, after the expiry of the gag order, Raj announced, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>given</b> up my mission", thus signalling to his supporters of continuing his stance on the migrant issue.|$|E
500|$|Although {{having written}} about eight songs while on tour in 2005, Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy {{decided to write}} new music because they wanted the album to be [...] "...quite new, to be quite {{different}} sounding from everything we've ever done before." [...] Despite having recorded their second album in {{a short amount of}} time, Kapranos stressed that the band wanted to take their time. He voices, [...] "This time we wanted to spend more time developing, and also, I suppose, allowing songs and sounds to evolve more before we ended up writing an album, and absorbing more music and ideas and, I suppose, life itself. And when I say life, I mean life off the road, because I wouldn't classify life on the road as real life." [...] Franz Ferdinand began working on Tonight in early 2007. Franz Ferdinand was supposed to record the album with producer Brian Higgins, yet in March 2008, the two entities parted ways. The drummer, Paul Thomson, says [...] "We wrote with Higgins for a while and initially we thought we'd work more with him but it didn't really work out. We just realized that we're not really a pop group." [...] However, they also commented they <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>given</b> up on the pop concept. The songs on the album were written and recorded at the old town hall of Govan, Scotland as well as Mr. Dan's Studio in Buckeye, Arizona. The band first moved into Govan's old town hall following a year of touring in support of their second studio album and mostly used it for storing and rehearsing.|$|E
500|$|Olinda's {{position}} was precarious. [...] "He lacked {{the character and}} skills to impose his authority, while the attempts he did make to take control were seen as presumptuous, a usurpation of a position belonging to the emperor alone." [...] The [...] "generation of politicians {{who had come to}} power in the 1830s, following upon the abdication of Pedro I, had learned from bitter experience the difficulties and dangers of government. By 1840 they had lost all faith in their ability to rule the country on their own. They accepted Pedro II as an authority figure whose presence was indispensable for the country's survival." [...] The Liberals took the dispute over lowering the age of majority directly to the populace, inciting them to place pressure on the politicians. The Brazilian people supported lowering the age of majority and a popular song was heard in the streets: [...] "We want Pedro the Second,/ Although he is not of age;/ The nation excuses the law,/ and long live the majority!" [...] As emperor, Pedro II [...] "was the living symbol of the unity of the fatherland [...] This position gave him, in the eyes of public opinion, a higher authority than that of any regent." [...] The Conservatives weren’t opposed to the Liberal plan, and both (including the regent himself, who would inevitably lose his office) wished to end the regency. Olinda asked Pedro II what he thought about the issue of majority, and he simply answered, [...] "I have not thought about that," [...] and continued, [...] "I have already heard about it, but I <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>given</b> it any attention." ...|$|E

500|$|IGN {{reviewer}} Matt Fowler {{gave the}} episode an [...] "Incredible" [...] rating of 9.6/10, saying that: [...] "I'm sure we all loved Dexter's final moments with Arthur, {{down in the}} toy train bomb shelter, but now {{looking back at the}} scene, knowing the final moments of the episode, it's filled with so many more eerie easter eggs. Something was definitely up when Arthur said, [...] "It's already over." [...] We all thought so because we've heard him say those words before. We also saw Dexter take a beat after the line, confused about its meaning. We could have chalked it {{up to the fact that}} Arthur was accepting his own death, but Dexter's furrowed brow let us know that something more sinister was in play here. Of course, the real bitch here is that Dexter, having dispatched of Trinity officially, now can't go back and do it with the spirit of vengeance. The scene stands quite beautifully on its own, but Dexter would certainly <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>given</b> Arthur an empathetic send off if he knew what that monster had done. We can all point fingers at certain missteps that Dexter took throughout the entire season - mistakes that led to Rita's demise - but when you take it in as a whole it's a rather satisfying and cleverly constructed story that actually made us all buy and believe, by the end, that Dexter truly wanted to be rid of his murderous spirit. His stubborn need to kill Trinity himself wound up circumventing the entire justice system, which would have wound up catching Arthur based solely on Deb's tenacity and expert detective work." [...] Also, IGN listed Arthur Mitchell as 2nd on a list of Dexter's Top 10 Kills saying that [...] "This was the murder that America was clamoring for. And it was effin' great." [...] In his review of the entire fourth season, Fowler, giving the season an [...] "Incredible" [...] rating of 9.5, said of the finale that [...] "It all just came off as a ton of creepy, guilty fun. I would bet that when we all saw the final scene of the season finale that we, simply due to the time we've spent the characters over four years, felt a ton of emotions that we might not have even known were there." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kellogg {{protested that}} {{education}} of Indians needed to involve Native Indian traditional practices and ideologies, describing [...] "noble qualities and traits {{and a set}} of literary traditions" [...] that Indians should preserve. She also condemned materialism: “Where wealth is the ruling power and intellectual attainments secondary, we must watch out…that we do not act altogether upon the dictates of a people who <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>given</b> sufficient time and thought to our own peculiar problems, and we must cease to be dependent on their estimates of our position”. However, Kellogg differed with other reformers who wanted to abolish the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Kellogg believed that the Bureau of Indian Affairs could play a different role, that of guarantor of sovereignty and protector of Native peoples from grafters and petty state politics. Kellogg's outspoken criticism and activities earned her powerful adversaries. There were efforts to discredit Kellogg and she was arrested at least four separate occasions on the series of charges relating to her activities.|$|E

As many as 250,000 lives were lost. Two days after the cyclone hit, Yahya arrived in Dhaka after a trip to Beijing, but he left a day later. His seeming indifference {{to the plight of}} Bengali victims caused a great deal of animosity. Opposition newspapers in Dhaka accused the Pakistani government of impeding the efforts of international relief agencies and of [...] "gross neglect, callous inattention, and bitter indifference."

Finally I came here as an underdog, 10 points behind and had the nerves to keep calm, I did the job yesterday and today managed to win it also. I’m so happy for my team, so happy for the ABT Schaeffler Audi Sport guys, they really deserve it." [...] He later claimed to <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>given</b> up hope in winning the championship despite a competitive field and retiring from the Paris ePrix, but also admitted that focusing on Formula E after Audi's withdrawal from the World Endurance Championship at the end of 2016 aided his title effort. While Buemi admitted his disappointment in losing the championship, he congratulated di Grassi on securing the accolade, and stated him missing the New York City races was not an excuse in his loss. Regarding his pit stop early in the race, Buemi chose not to judge if the stewards made the correct decision and admitted not knowing about the regulation that required him to enter the pit lane because of car damage.|$|E
