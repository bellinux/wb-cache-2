40|$|A general {{model for}} {{holographic}} stereograms {{in the context}} of discrete and continuous optical systems is presented. Building from a simple, highly constrained model, restrictions on the viewer's horizontal position and depth, the size and location of the plane of the stereogram's slits, the spatial resolution of the points in the imaged object, and the optical properties of the projection screen are relaxed one by one. Emphasis is placed on accurate modeling of the stereogram and on the correspondence between the photographic capture, holographic recording, and final viewing geometries. Bandlimiting and anamorphic distortion techniques useful for producing artifact-free images are presented. Discussion centers on horizontal parallax only, <b>flat</b> <b>format,</b> computer generated stereograms, but general conclusions applicable to other stereogram types are drawn.

Early data mining algorithms often assumed a database interface to the data, but it is now more common to assume that the data is extracted and stored in some <b>flat</b> <b>format</b> before algorithms are executed on it.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the solution of}} large sparse linear systems by means of direct factorization based on a multifrontal approach. Although numerically robust {{and easy to use}} (it only needs algebraic information: the input matrix A and a right-hand side b, even if it can also digest preprocessing strategies based on geometric information), direct factorization methods are computationally intensive both in terms of memory and operations, which limits their scope on very large problems (matrices with up to few hundred millions of equations). This work focuses on exploiting low-rank approximations on multifrontal based direct methods to reduce both the memory footprints and the operation count, in sequential and distributed-memory environments, on a wide class of problems. We first survey the low-rank formats which have been previously developed to efficiently represent dense matrices and have been widely used to design fast solutions of partial differential equations, integral equations and eigenvalue problems. These formats are hierarchical (H and Hierarchically Semiseparable matrices are the most common ones) and have been (both theoretically and practically) shown to substantially decrease the memory and operation requirements for linear algebra computations. However, they impose many structural constraints which can limit their scope and efficiency, especially in the context of general purpose multifrontal solvers. We propose a <b>flat</b> <b>format</b> called Block Low-Rank (BLR) based on a natural blocking of the matrices and explain why it provides all the flexibility needed by a general purpose multifrontal solver in terms of numerical pivoting for stability and parallelism. We compare BLR format with other formats and show that BLR does not compromise much the memory and operation improvements achieved through low-rank approximations. A stability study shows that the approximations are well controlled by an explicit numerical parameter called low-rank threshold, which is critical in order to solve the sparse linear system accurately. Details on how Block Low-Rank factorizations can be efficiently implemented within multifrontal solvers are then given. We propose several Block Low-Rank factorization algorithms which allow for different types of gains. The proposed algorithms have been implemented within the MUMPS (MUltifrontal Massively Parallel Solver) solver. We first report experiments on standard partial differential equations based problems to analyse the main features of our BLR algorithms and to show the potential and flexibility of the approach; a comparison with a Hierarchically SemiSeparable code is also given. Then, Block Low-Rank formats are experimented on large (up to a hundred millions of unknowns) and various problems coming from several industrial applications. We finally illustrate the use of our approach as a preconditioning method for the Conjugate Gradient...|$|E

O experimento foi conduzido a campo em Viçosa, de setembro/ 2000 a julho/ 2001. Utilizou-se o delineamento {{experimental}} de blocos casualizados, com cinco repetições e 36 tratamentos (clones), dos quais apenas 11 acessos (BGH 5920, BGH 5926, BGH 5927, BGH 6087, BGH 6089, BGH 6091, BGH 6093, BGH 6094, BGH 6136, BGH 6306 e BGH 6606) apresentaram florescimento espontâneo, passíveis de serem avaliados. A proporção entre o apêndice estéril e porção masculina foi em média de 1, 02, variando de 0, 4 (BGH 6136) a 1, 4 (BGH 6087). A inflorescência é circundada por uma espata cuja coloração da parte superior (CL) varia do amarelo claro, com ou sem a presença de manchas vermelhas, ao amarelo alaranjado. A cor da porção inferior da espata, contendo as flores femininas (tubo da inflorescência), varia do verde, com ou sem raias ou manchas escuras a púrpura. A espata, na antese, apresenta-se na forma aplanada (BGH 5920, BGH 5926, BGH 6091, BGH 6093, BGH 6094 e BGH 6306) ou encapuchada (BGH 5927, BGH 6087, BGH 6089, BGH 6136 e BGH 6606), com a porção masculina exposta ou envolta, respectivamente. A cor da haste das inflorescências (pedúnculo) variou do verde claro ao púrpuro, com proporção entre comprimentos do pedúnculo e da inflorescência (PCPI) média de 1, 8, variando de 1, 1 (BGH 5927) a 2, 3 (BGH 6089). As inflorescências saem em número de 1 a 5 por axila foliar (NIAF) e apresentam de 1 a 2 ramalhetes florais por planta (NRFP). Os acessos de taro, agrupados pelo método de Tocher, formaram quatro grupos: I (BGH 5920, BGH 6091, BGH 6093, BGH 6094, BGH 5926, BGH 6606 e BGH 6087), II (BGH 6089 e BGH 6306), III (BGH 6136) e IV (BGH 5927).

Plants were grown from 19 / 09 / 00 to 13 / 07 / 01. Field plots were arranged in a randomized block design with five replicates containing 36 treatments (clones), in which only 11 accesses (BGH 5920, BGH 5926, BGH 5927, BGH 6087, BGH 6089, BGH 6091, BGH 6093, BGH 6094, BGH 6136, BGH 6306 and BGH 6606) flowered spontaneously. The ratio between sterile appendage and male portion was on average 1. 02, varying from 0. 4 (BGH 6136) to 1. 4 (BGH 6087). The inflorescence {{is surrounded by a}} spathe with light yellow color at the upper part (LC), with or without spots of red, or yellow-orange color. The bottom portion of the spathe which contains the female flowers (inflorescence tube) varied from green, containing or not strips or spots dark to purple color. At anthesis, the spathe shows <b>flat</b> <b>format</b> (BGH 5920, BGH 5926, BGH 6091, BGH 6093, BGH 6094 and BGH 6306) or hooded (BGH 5927, BGH 6087, BGH 6089, BGH 6136 and BGH 6606), with the male portion exposed or enclosed, respectively. The color of flower stalk varied from pale green to purplish, and ratio between total and inflorescence stalk length (LSLIR) average was 1. 8, varying from 1. 1 (BGH 5927) to 2. 3 (BGH 6089). Number of inflorescences (NI) ranged from 1 to 5 per leaf axis, composing 1 to 2 floral clusters per plant (NFCP). Based on flower morphology the accesses formed four groups by Tocher method: I (BGH 5920, BGH 6091, BGH 6093, BGH 6094, BGH 5926, BGH 6606 and BGH 6087), II (BGH 6089, BGH 6306), III (BGH 6136) and (BGH 5927).
