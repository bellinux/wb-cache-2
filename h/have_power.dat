50|$|Like Union Judiciary, {{the state}} {{judiciary}} also possesses wide powers, mainly power of judicial review. It also <b>has</b> <b>power</b> to issue various writs to courts and authority under its jurisdiction. It <b>has</b> <b>power</b> of superintendence on all courts under it.|$|R

5|$|Furthermore, {{executive}} {{power in the}} EU isn't concentrated in a single institution. It becomes clearer under the Lisbon Treaty with {{the division of the}} European Council as a distinct institution with a fixed President. This arrangement has been compared to the dual executive system found in the French republic where there is a President (the Council President) and Prime Minister (the Commission President). However, unlike the French model, the Council President does not hold formal powers such as the ability to directly appoint and sack the other, or the ability to dissolve Parliament. Hence while the Council President may have prestige, it would lack power and while the Commission President would <b>have</b> <b>power,</b> it would lack the prestige of the former.|$|E
5|$|The {{base engine}} was {{a version of}} the older Simca Type 180 2.0-litre with {{increased}} displacement, as also featured in the Matra Murena. It was unrelated to either the American Chrysler K or PSA Douvrin 2.2-litre engines. Available trim levels were designated GL and GLS. The GL was the only model to feature the four-speed manual transmission, and <b>have</b> <b>power</b> steering as an option as opposed to standard. It was first to be dropped, for the 1983 model year.|$|E

Moreover, our test <b>has</b> <b>power</b> against the alternative hypothesis of time-varying kurtosis, while the test for second order (covariance) stationarity introduced by Xiao and Lima (2007) <b>has</b> <b>power</b> close to size against this alternative...|$|R

5|$|The {{book has}} often been {{described}} as a Bildungsroman or coming of age story, as it explores Ged's process of learning to cope with power and come to terms with death. The novel also carries Taoist themes about a fundamental balance in the universe of Earthsea, which wizards are supposed to maintain, closely tied to the idea that language and names <b>have</b> <b>power</b> to affect the material world and alter this balance. Although the structure of the story {{is similar to that of}} a traditional epic, critics have also described it as subverting this genre in many ways, such as by making the protagonist dark-skinned, in comparison to more typical white-skinned heroes.|$|E
5|$|The gods were {{believed}} to have many names. Among them were secret names that conveyed their true natures more profoundly than others. To know the true name of a deity was to <b>have</b> <b>power</b> over it. The importance of names is demonstrated by a myth in which Isis poisons the superior god Ra and refuses to cure him unless he reveals his secret name to her. Upon learning the name, she tells it to her son, Horus, and by learning it they gain greater knowledge and power.|$|E
5|$|Festivals often {{involved}} a ceremonial procession {{in which a}} cult image was carried out of the temple in a barque-shaped shrine. These processions served various purposes. In Roman times, when local deities of all kinds were believed to <b>have</b> <b>power</b> over the Nile inundation, processions in many communities carried temple images to the riverbanks so the gods could invoke a large and fruitful flood. Processions also traveled between temples, as when the image of Hathor from Dendera Temple visited her consort Horus at the Temple of Edfu. Rituals for a god were often based in that deity's mythology. Such rituals {{were meant to be}} repetitions of the events of the mythic past, renewing the beneficial effects of the original events. In the Khoiak festival in honor of Osiris, his death and resurrection were ritually reenacted at a time when crops were beginning to sprout. The returning greenery symbolized the renewal of the god's own life.|$|E
60|$|The Church <b>has</b> <b>power</b> from God's word {{to order}} all matters of order so as shall appear {{to them to}} conduce to decency and edification: but ceremonies respect the orderly {{performance}} of divine service: ergo, the Church <b>has</b> <b>power</b> to ordain ceremonies: but the Cross in baptizing is a ceremony; ergo, the Church <b>has</b> <b>power</b> to prescribe the crossing in Baptism. What is rightfully ordered cannot be rightfully withstood:--but the crossing, &c., is rightfully ordered:--'ergo', the crossing cannot be rightfully omitted.|$|R

5|$|In {{response}} to Clement's visit, moreover, the Pope had empowered the Bishops of Dunkeld, Brechin and St Andrews {{to take action}} to rescue the bishopric. He told these bishops that, Since the continual care of all the churches is our daily burden, we grant to the said Church , so far as we personally can, and authorise you, if you find the situation to be as described, to assign to the said Bishop, if it can be done without scandal, a quarter of the teinds of all the parish churches of the Diocese of Dunblane, so that under your guidance and that of upright men, he may set aside a suitable portion of them for his own maintenance, and thereafter assign revenues for a dean and canons whom we wish and authorise you to institute there. Failing this, the Pope wrote, The quarter teinds of all the churches of the Diocese assigned to the Bishop, which are held by laymen, you shall transfer with the episcopal seat to the Canons Regular of St. John in the Diocese , who shall <b>have</b> <b>power</b> to elect a Bishop in any vacancy.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, the law {{provides}} that the High Court and the Court of Appeal <b>have</b> <b>power</b> to punish for contempt of court. This {{has been interpreted}} by the courts to include punishing a person for scandalizing the court {{when he or she}} is not in a judge's physical presence and in a context unconnected with matters pending before the Supreme Court. On the other hand, the State Courts only <b>have</b> <b>power</b> to punish contemptuous acts committed or words spoken {{in the face of the}} court or in connection with proceedings in the courts.|$|E

He therefore abolished the Patriarchy, replacing it with a Holy Synod that was under the control of a senior bureaucrat; the Tsar appointed all bishops.|$|E
25|$|There are {{technical}} and cultural aspects to the producing maps. In this sense, maps are biased. The study of bias, influence, and agenda {{in making a}} map is what comprise a map's deconstruction. A central tenet of deconstructionism is that maps <b>have</b> <b>power.</b> Other assertions are that maps are inherently biased and that we search for metaphor and rhetoric in maps.|$|E
