40|$|Purpose - To {{examine the}} effects of optical blur, {{auditory}} distractors and age on eye movement patterns while performing a driving hazard perception test (HPT). Methods - Twenty young (mean age 27. 1 ± 4. 6 years) and 20 older (73. 3 ± 5. 7 years) drivers with normal vision completed a HPT in a repeated-measures counterbalanced design while their eye movements were recorded. Testing was performed under two visual (best-corrected vision and with + 2. 00 DS blur) and two distractor (with and without auditory distraction) conditions. Participants were required to respond to road hazards appearing in the HPT videos of real-world driving scenes and their hazard response times were recorded. Results - Blur and distractors each significantly <b>delayed</b> <b>hazard</b> response time, by 0. 42 and 0. 76 s respectively (p< 0. 05). A significant interaction between age and distractors indicated that older drivers were more affected by distractors than young drivers (response with distractors delayed by 0. 96 and 0. 60 s respectively). There were no other two- or three-way interaction effect on response time. With blur, both groups fixated significantly longer on hazards before responding compared to best-corrected vision. In the presence of distractors, both groups exhibited delayed first fixation on the hazards and spent less time fixating on the hazards. There were also significant differences in eye movement characteristics between groups, where older drivers exhibited smaller saccades, delayed first fixation on hazards, and shorter fixation duration on hazards compared to the young drivers. Conclusions - Collectively, the findings of <b>delayed</b> <b>hazard</b> response times and alterations in eye movement patterns with blur and distractors provide further evidence that visual impairment and distractors are independently detrimental to driving safety given that <b>delayed</b> <b>hazard</b> response times are linked to increased crash risk...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{underlying the}} elevated crash rates of older drivers with glaucoma are poorly understood. A key driving skill is timely detection of hazards; however, the hazard detection ability of drivers with glaucoma {{has been largely}} unexplored. This study assessed the eye movement patterns and visual predictors of performance on a laboratory-based hazard detection task in older drivers with glaucoma. Participants included 30 older drivers with glaucoma (71 ± 7 years; average better-eye mean deviation (MD) = - 3. 1 ± 3. 2 dB; average worse-eye MD = - 11. 9 ± 6. 2 dB) and 25 age-matched controls (72 ± 7 years). Visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, visual fields, useful field of view (UFoV; processing speeds), and motion sensitivity were assessed. Participants completed a computerised Hazard Perception Test (HPT) while their eye movements were recorded using a desk-mounted Tobii TX 300 eye-tracking system. The HPT comprises a series of real-world traffic videos recorded from the driver's perspective; participants responded to road hazards appearing in the videos, and hazard response times were determined. Participants with glaucoma exhibited an average of 0. 42 seconds <b>delay</b> in <b>hazard</b> response time (p = 0. 001), smaller saccades (p = 0. 010), and delayed first fixation on hazards (p< 0. 001) compared to controls. Importantly, larger saccades were associated with faster hazard responses in the glaucoma group (p = 0. 004), {{but not in the}} control group (p = 0. 19). Across both groups, significant visual predictors of hazard response times included motion sensitivity, UFoV, and worse-eye MD (p< 0. 05).

Methods: Participants with binocular CFL (scotoma diameter, 7 �- 25 �; visual acuity, 0. 3 - 1. 0 logMAR) using lateral preferred retinal fixation loci and matched controls with normal vision drove in a simulator for approximately 1 1 ⁄ 2 hours per session for 2 sessions a week apart. Participants responded to frequent virtual pedestrians who appeared on either the left or right sides and approached the participant’s lane on a collision trajectory that, therefore, caused them to remain in approximately the same area of the visual field. Results: The study included 11 individuals with CFL and 11 controls with normal vision. The CFL participants had more detection failures for pedestrians who appeared in areas of visual field loss than did controls in corresponding areas (6. 4 % vs 0. 2 %). Furthermore, the CFL participants reacted more slowly to pedestrians in blind than nonscotomatous areas (4. 28 vs 2. 43 seconds, P �. 001) and overall had more late and missed responses than controls (29 % vs 3 %, P �. 001). Scotoma size and contrast sensitivity predicted outcomes in blind and seeing areas, respectively. Visual acuity was not correlated with response measures. Conclusions: In addition to causing visual acuity and contrast sensitivity loss, the central scotoma per se <b>delayed</b> <b>hazard</b> detection even though small eye movements could potentially compensate for the loss. Responses in nonscotomatous areas were also delayed, although to a lesser extent, possibly because of the eccentricity of fixation.

40|$|IntroductionThe {{impact of}} {{treatment}} delays on survival {{of patients with}} {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) is uncertain. Although later treatment could negatively affect psychological well-being, the maximum acceptable waiting time has not been determined. MethodsWe analyzed consecutive patients with NSCLC between January 2005 and May 2007 in our center. Treatment delay was calculated from the first abnormal radiographic study. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to identify predictive factors and log-rank tests to compare survival. ResultsFour hundred ninety-five cases were identified; shorter treatment delays were associated with a poor prognosis. Conversely, for every week that the treatment could be <b>delayed,</b> the <b>hazard</b> ratio was improved at 0. 97 (p = 0. 05). Standard treatment was given to 319 of these patients who were separated in localized, regional, and advanced stages. The median treatment delay was 73 days and distributed as follows: 85, 94, and 50 days for localized, regional, and advanced stages, respectively (p < 0. 01). For localized or regional stages, the association between treatment delay and survival was inconclusive. In the advanced group, each week of treatment <b>delay</b> had a <b>hazard</b> ratio of 0. 93 (p = 0. 009). Survival of advanced patients who began treatment earlier versus later than the group median was 6. 8 versus 11. 6 months (p = 0. 027). ConclusionsFor patients with advanced NSCLC receiving equivalent chemotherapy regimens, shorter treatment delays were associated with shorter survival. We hypothesize that urgent treatment carried a negative prognostic meaning, as this was preferentially offered to patients presenting with a higher symptom burden, which conferred them a worse outcome...|$|R
40|$|Bipolar {{disorder}} {{is a significant}} cause of morbidity and mortality. Although existing treatments are effective, {{there is often a}} substantial delay before diagnosis and treatment initiation. We sought to investigate factors associated with the delay before diagnosis of bipolar disorder and the onset of treatment in secondary mental healthcare. Retrospective cohort study using anonymised electronic mental health record data from the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLaM) Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) Case Register on 1364 adults diagnosed with bipolar disorder between 2007 and 2012. The following predictor variables were analysed in a multivariable Cox regression analysis: age, gender, ethnicity, compulsory admission to hospital under the UK Mental Health Act, marital status and other diagnoses prior to bipolar disorder. The outcomes were time to recorded diagnosis from first presentation to specialist mental health services (the diagnostic delay), and time to the start of appropriate therapy (treatment delay). The median diagnostic delay was 62 days (interquartile range: 17 - 243) and median treatment delay was 31 days (4 - 122). Compulsory hospital admission was associated with a significant reduction in both diagnostic <b>delay</b> (<b>hazard</b> ratio 2. 58, 95 % CI 2. 18 - 3. 06) and treatment delay (4. 40, 3. 63 - 5. 62). Prior diagnoses of other psychiatric disorders were associated with increased diagnostic delay, particularly alcohol (0. 48, 0. 33 - 0. 41) and substance misuse disorders (0. 44, 0. 31 - 0. 61). Prior diagnosis of schizophrenia and psychotic depression were associated with reduced treatment delay. Some individuals experience a significant delay in diagnosis and treatment of bipolar disorder after initiation of specialist mental healthcare, particularly those who have prior diagnoses of alcohol and substance misuse disorders. These findings highlight a need for further study on strategies to better identify underlying symptoms and offer appropriate treatment sooner in order to facilitate improved clinical outcomes, such as developing specialist early intervention services to identify and treat people with bipolar disorder...|$|R

Asynchronous compute therefore could easily hurt performance on Maxwell if it is not coded to work with Maxwell's static scheduler. Furthermore, graphics tasks saturate Nvidia GPUs much more easily than they do to AMD's GCN-based GPUs, which are much more heavily weighted towards compute, so Nvidia GPUs have fewer scheduling holes that could be filled by asynchronous compute than AMD's. For this reason, in order to prevent Maxwell GPUs from being partitioned, the driver submits tasks one task at a time.|$|R

To handle crosstalk and wire length reduction problem, an improved non-Manhattan router in the gridded routing model is developed, and a novel rerouting algorithm based on segment-rerouting technique and layer reassignment is presented. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our algorithm achieves very good results. Key words crosstalk; wire length; track; channel routing; non-Manhattan; layer reassignment With the {{recent advances in}} VLSI fabrication technology, the device sizes have shrunk blow 0. 1 μm. Due to the scaling down of device geometry in deep-submicron technologies, the crosstalk between adjacent nets {{has become a major}} concern in high performance VLSI circuit design.

Methods: Sixty peritoneal dialysis patients and 30 hemodialysis and 30 non-dialyzed stage 3 - 5 chronic kidney disease patients without history of stroke were enrolled for the study. Participants were matched for age, gender, education, diabetes status, and dialysis duration (if appropriate). Cognitive functions were measured using a battery of recognized instruments. Brain features were examined with 3 -dimensional magnetic resonance imaging. Results: Cognitive impairment was significantly more severe in dialysis patients than in non-dialyzed patients. The global and specific cognitive function were not significantly different between patients on peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis. Hemodialysis patients had more severe white matter hyperintensity, sulcal and ventricular atrophy, and SVIs than other patients. In all groups, higher white matter grade, ventricular grade, and hippocampal atrophy were significantly associated with global cognitive impairment, with hazard ratios of 1. 80 (1. 22 - 2. 64), 1. 67 (1. 09 - 2. 57), and 2. 49 (1. 07 - 5. 77), respectively.

40|$|Abstract: Thanks to {{advances}} in MCMC methodology, Bayesian curve estimation {{has become an}} increasingly popular subject both in practice and in theoretical research. Prior specification for curves is a more challenging task than for scalar or multivariate parameters. Besides using fully parametric curves, common strategies include using a stochastic process or discretizing the curve, {{each with its own}} advantages and pitfalls. In this paper we adopt the second strategy, primarily for its practicality for general users, in the context of hazard (and survival) curve estimation. We adapt a multiresolution modeling approach from the engineering literature, which provides a resolution-invariant prior for hazard increments, with their a priori dependence conveniently specified via tuning a few hyperparameters. We also investigate a hierarchical mixing strategy to combat a pitfall of the multiresolution approach: that nearby cells may exhibit lower dependence than cells that are far apart {{due to the fact that}} the multiresolution approach is based on a binary tree construction and not the usual Euclidean topology. Our investigations include both simulated and textbook data, as well as comparisons to the first strategy based on a Beta process prior, and to the second strategy based on a discretized correlated Gamma process prior.

40|$|SUMMARY. Evidence {{suggests}} {{that patients with}} psychiatric illnesses {{may be more likely}} to experience a delay in diagnosis of coexisting cancer. The association between psychiatric illness and timely diagnosis and survival in patients with esophageal cancer has not been studied. The specific aim of this retrospective cohort study was to determine the impact of coexisting psychiatric illness on time to diagnosis, disease stage and survival in patients with esophageal cancer. All patients with a diagnosis of esophageal cancer between 1989 and 2003 at the Portland Veteran’s Administration hospital were identified by ICD- 9 code. One hundred and sixty patients were identified: 52 patients had one or more DSM-IV diagnoses, and 108 patients had no DSM-IV diagnosis. Electronic charts were reviewed beginning from the first recorded encounter for all patients and clinical and demographic data were collected. The association between psychiatric illness and time to diagnosis of esophageal cancer and survival was studied using Cox proportional hazard models. Groups were similar in age, ethnicity, body mass index, and history of tobacco and alcohol use. Psychiatric illness was associated with delayed diagnosis (median time from alarm symptoms to diagnosis 90 days vs. 35 days in patients with and without psychiatric illness, respectively, P < 0. 001) and the presence of advanced disease at the time of diagnosis (37 % vs. 18 % of patients with and without psychiatric illness, respectively, P = 0. 009).

40|$|Objective: It is {{well known}} that {{advancing}} paternal age is associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia in off-spring, but the mechanism behind this association remains unknown. This study investigates if delayed fatherhood rather than advancing paternal age per se might explain the increased risk of schizophrenia in offspring associated with advancing paternal age. Methods: This is a register-based study of the Swedish population looking at people born 1955 – 1985 who have 1 or 2 siblings (n = 2   589   502). The main analysis investigated whether the association between advancing paternal age and schizophrenia was explained by delayed fatherhood. Possible confounding factors were taken into account. Cox regression was used throughout. Results: In the main analysis the association between advancing paternal age and increased risk of schizophrenia in offspring disappeared after controlling for <b>delayed</b> fatherhood (<b>hazard</b> ratio [HR] = 0. 93, 95 % CI = 0. 72 – 1. 21 comparing 45 + years old fathers to those 25 – 29), whereas delayed fatherhood showed an association with increased risk of schizophrenia in offspring compar-ing 35 – 39 and 40 – 44  years old fathers to 25 – 29  year olds (HR = 1. 37, 95 % CI = 1. 18 – 1. 58; HR = 1. 81, 95 % CI = 1. 44 – 2. 28, respectively). The results remained when con-trolling for possible confounders. Conclusions: This study suggests that the association between paternal age and schizophrenia is not due to paternal age per se, but rather to an unknown factor associated with both delayed father-hood and schizophrenia.

It can be defined as walkways and pedestrian crossings Pedestrian have a right to cross roads safely. Therefore road designers have a professional responsibility to plan, design and provide safe walking and crossing facilities. Recent accident studies identified that pedestrian comprise a significant proportion of serious injuries and fatalities while they were crossing the road without using a marked pedestrian crossing. As the majority of pedestrian accident occur while crossing a road, the need of safe and efficient pedestrian crossing facilities could be the most important pedestrian safety factor. Sight distance, Level of Service and delay to pedestrian are major terms to be considered with warrants prior to installation of pedestrian crossing at a location of road being considered. Some time there would be additional <b>delay</b> and <b>hazard</b> by introducing crossing where it is not needed or is not suitable. Pedestrian characteristics and travel behaviour in the form of relationships among parameters such as speed, density, flow and space of pedestrian need to be identified by conducting further pedestrian surveys such as flow and travel time Design of a pedestrian crossing requires a basic understanding of related human characteristics and capabilities which are dependent on age, physical and mental condition of pedestrians, who are expected to use the crossing at that particular location. So the main aim of this study is to develop a guideline to assist in determining the appropriate crossing facility for a given location of a road based on the sight distance, Level of Service, delay to pedestrians and vehicles, pedestrian speed, density, flow and space in addition to the warrants.

ResultsPatients with high levels of CD 8 + tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes demonstrated better survival than those with low levels (3 -year survival: 83 % vs 28 %; P =. 06). Moreover, high levels of CD 8 + tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were associated with a lower incidence of mediastinal node disease (P =. 004) and longer progression-free survival (P =. 05). Higher levels of CD 8 + tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were observed in patients treated with cisplatin and pemetrexed than in those treated with cisplatin and vinorelbine (P =. 02). Patients presenting high levels of CD 4 + or CD 25 + tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes or low levels of CD 45 RO+ also demonstrated a trend toward shorter survival. However, the presence of FOXP 3 + tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes did not affect survival. After multivariate adjustment, high levels of CD 8 + tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes remained an independent prognostic factor associated with <b>delayed</b> recurrence (<b>hazard</b> ratio = 0. 38; confidence interval = 0. 09 – 0. 87; P =. 02) and better survival (hazard ratio = 0. 39; confidence interval = 0. 09 – 0. 89; P =. 02). ConclusionThe presence of high levels of CD 8 + tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes is associated with better prognosis in patients undergoing extrapleural pneumonectomy for malignant pleural mesothelioma. The stimulation of CD 8 + lymphocytes can be a potential therapeutic strategy to improve outcome...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMountain ranges are {{frequently}} subjected to mass wasting events triggered by storms or earthquakes and supply {{large volumes of}} sediment into river networks. Besides altering river dynamics, large sediment deliveries to alluvial fans are known to cause hydro-sedimentary hazards such as flooding and river avulsion. Here we explore how the sediment supply history affects hydro-sedimentary river and fan hazards, and how well can it be predicted given the uncertainties on boundary conditions. We use the 2 D morphodynamic model Eros with a new 2 D hydrodynamic model driven by a sequence of flood, a sediment entrainment/transport/deposition model and a bank erosion law. We first evaluate the model against a natural case: the 1999 Mount Adams rock avalanche and subsequent avulsion on the Poerua river fan (West Coast, New Zealand). By adjusting for the unknown sediment supply history, Eros predicts {{the evolution of the}} alluvial riverbed during the first post-landslide stages within 30 [*]cm. The model is subsequently used to infer how the sediment supply volume and rate control the fan aggradation patterns and associated hazards. Our results show that the total injected volume controls the overall levels of aggradation, but supply rates have a major control on the location of preferential deposition, avulsion and increased flooding risk. Fan re-incision following exhaustion of the landslide-derived sediment supply leads to sediment transfer and deposition downstream and poses similar, but <b>delayed,</b> hydro-sedimentary <b>hazards.</b> Our results demonstrate that 2 D morphodynamics models are able to capture the full range of hazards occurring in alluvial fans including river avulsion aggradation and floods. However, only ensemble simulations accounting for uncertainties in boundary conditions (e. g., discharge history, initial topography, grain size) as well as model realization (e. g., non-linearities in hydro-sedimentary processes) can be used to produce probabilistic hazards maps relevant for decision making...|$|R
40|$|Inspired {{by several}} recent papers {{that focus on}} {{scheduling}} disciplines for network flows, we present a mean delay analysis of Multilevel Processor Sharing (MLPS) scheduling disciplines {{in the context of}} M/G/ 1 queues. Such disciplines have been proposed to model the e#ect of the di#erentiation between short and long TCP flows in the Internet. Under MLPS, jobs are classified into classes depending on their attained service. We consider scheduling disciplines where jobs within the same class are served either with Processor Sharing (PS) or Foreground Background (FB) policy, and the class that contains jobs with the smallest attained service is served first. It is known that the FB policy minimizes (maximizes) the mean <b>delay</b> when the <b>hazard</b> rate of the job size distribution is decreasing (increasing). Our analysis, based on pathwise and meanwise arguments of the unfinished truncated work, shows that Two-Level Processor Sharing (TLPS) disciplines, e. g., FB+PS and PS+PS, are better than PS scheduling when the hazard rate of the job size distribution is decreasing. If the hazard rate is increasing and bounded, we show that PS outperforms PS+PS and FB+PS. We further extend our analysis to study local optimality within a level of an MLPS scheduling discipline...|$|R
40|$|High-fidelity {{telepresence}} {{is considered}} to be a key subject for the development of advanced robotic applications in space and surgery. The fact that there are only few robots in space and surgery is mainly due to the lack of broadly available sophisticated autonomy and haptic feedback within present robotic systems. Nevertheless, these requirements need to be fullled to overcome telepresence barriers, such as (communication) <b>delay,</b> scaling, matter, <b>hazard</b> etc. Besides the technological need for ultralight impedance-controlled robots combined with a high-speed data link the telepresence control strategies including supervisory and bilateral control are essential for high-delity telepresence and an immersive impression of the remote side to the human operator. This approach is successfully tested recently within the technology experiment ROKVISS, Germany's present space robotic project. Its aim is the verication and qualication of the DLR's newest lightweight robot joint technologies and provides, for the rst time, realistic force feedback in a telepresence space application. The same holds for the new telepresence system for minimally invasive robotic surgery The system will provide realistic 6 DoF force/torque feedback of the manipulation wrench as well as of the grasping force. Therefore, a lightweight robot for surgery is built, including a high-speed data link to the haptic master station...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{transportation}} issues addressed {{in recent years has}} been the growing concern about transportation infrastructure not being able to keep pace with development. This imbalance between transportation supply and demand has resulted in increased congestion, <b>delay</b> and safety <b>hazards</b> at many locations throughout the United States. As a result, traffic impact studies are becoming more popular as a planning tool so that the traffic impacts of new developments can be foreseen and effective mitigating measures can be taken using optimal allocation of available funds. The passage of the new Clean Air Act and the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act calls for more cooperation between developers and transportation professionals to move new transportation projects from design to implementation. In response to this need for cooperation between different levels of governments, developers and transportation professionals, the authors have developed a set of procedures within which a traffic impact study can be formulated. 1, 2 At the heart of these procedures is the determination of the scope of a traffic impact study for a proposed site. Using the concept of “warrant s, ” a flexible method of determining the necessary elements in a particular traffic impact analysis have been established. In this way, unnecessary analyses and delays can be avoided, while ensuring that all the required issues have been addressed...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To present {{statistical}} {{tools to}} model and optimize {{the cost of}} a randomized clinical trial {{as a function of the}} stringency of patient inclusion criteria. METHODS: We consider a two treatment, dichotomous outcome trial that includes a proportion of patients who are strong responders to the tested intervention. Patients are screened for inclusion using an arbitrary number of test results that are combined into an aggregate suitability score. The screening score is regarded as a diagnostic test for the responsive phenotype, having a specific cutoff value for inclusion and a particular sensitivity and specificity. The cutoff is a measure of stringency of inclusion criteria. Total cost is modeled as a function of the cutoff value, number of patients screened, the number of patients included, the case occurrence rate, response probabilities for control and experimental treatments, and the trial duration required to produce a statistically significant result with a specified power. Regression methods are developed to estimate relevant model parameters from pilot data in an adaptive trial design. RESULTS: The patient numbers and total cost are strongly related to the choice of the cutoff for inclusion. Clear cost minimums exist between 5. 6 and 6. 1 on a representative 10 -point scale of exclusiveness. Potential cost savings for typical trial scenarios range in millions of dollars. As the response rate for controls approaches 50 %, the proper choice of inclusion criteria can mean the difference between a successful trial and a failed trial. CONCLUSION: Early formal estimation of optimal inclusion criteria allows planning of clinical trials to avoid high costs, excessive <b>delays,</b> and moral <b>hazards</b> of Type II errors...|$|R
