2500|$|As {{head of the}} Natural History Collections at the British Museum, Owen {{received}} numerous inquiries {{and complaints}} about the Origin.

6000|$|... "Boy," [...] said Alworthy, [...] "I thought thee no such fool! Why crack thy brains with study when <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>show</b> <b>thee</b> a surer path to {{ease and}} preferment? But I see thou art {{too proud to}} do an old man a service. Thou writst thyself gentleman, forsooth, and high blood will not stoop." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>show</b> <b>thee,</b> niece, how {{the balance}} of fate inclines," [...] said Ermengarde, in a low and mysterious voice. [...] "Those united with us by blood have, in some sort, the {{privilege}} of looking forward beyond the points of present time, and seeing in their very bud the thorns or flowers which are one day to encircle their head." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] {{said the}} bishop, [...] "I think, daughter, that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> how {{to earn a}} living, where none are likely to seek for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay," [...] replied Freydisa, [...] "since <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> {{the door}} of the grave, and perchance the passage still stands. Yet, will you really enter there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Huck's got money. Maybe {{you don't}} believe it, but he's {{got lots of}} it. Oh, you needn't smile--I reckon <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>show</b> <b>you.</b> You just wait a minute." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; {{but if we}} were in {{the lion}} countries--I mean, in Africa, where it's very hot--the lions eat people there. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>show</b> it <b>you</b> in the book where I read it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Very well. Supposing that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> within half an {{hour that}} she is {{perfectly}} ready to marry somebody else--myself, for instance--would you still believe in her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{introduce}} you to Lords and swells," [...] he went on, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> a Famous Man, that's going to be. I can do that. Leastways--unless----" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "My son Tormot!" [...] he said, [...] "my {{youngest}} and dearest! But if I save Hector, I save all. Now, {{my darling}} dault, I {{have done for}} thee all that man may, excepting the last. Let me undo the clasps of that ill omened armour, and do thou put on that of Tormot; it is light, and will fit thee well. While you do so, I will rush on these crippled men, and make what play with them <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> <b>I</b> trust I shall have but little to do, for they are following each other like disabled steers. At least, darling of my soul, if I am unable to save <b>thee,</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>show</b> <b>thee</b> how a man should die." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>show</b> it <b>you.</b> <b>I</b> used to {{come and}} hover about the place in the old days, before I went to London, when I was such a fool that I couldn't speak to you if I met you. I am {{speaking}} of a time long before,--before that man came down here." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "If {{you really}} care for pictures," [...] he said, [...] "here's my card. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> some quite good ones any Sunday, if you're {{down the river}} and care to look in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear fellow," [...] said Newman, [...] "how <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>show</b> <b>YOU</b> a bridegroom's face? If {{you think}} I enjoy seeing you lie {{there and not}} being able to help you"-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, my friend," [...] said Braithwaite, [...] "how <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> {{a man who}} {{has left}} my house, and whom in the chances of this life, I am not very likely to see again, though hospitably desirous of so doing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she said, [...] "it {{still remains}} there. When we are round the next curve, <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>show</b> it to <b>you.</b> But every one has forgotten, I think, that it doesn't belong to Mr. Fentolin still. He uses it himself very often." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> some keen card-play {{and perhaps}} a clever game of billiards, besides a girl who's a great deal prettier than the dancer. But it's four miles out of town." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 14. Of this low-nestling, speechless, harmless, {{infinitely}} submissive, infinitely serviceable {{order of}} being, no Historian ever takes the smallest notice, {{except when it}} is robbed or slain. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> give you no picture of it, bring to your ears no murmur of it, nor cry. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> only <b>show</b> <b>you</b> the absolute 'must have been' of its unrewarded past, {{and the way in}} which all we have thought of, or been told, is founded on the deeper facts in its history, unthought of, and untold.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jeanne," [...] Ronald said, [...] "I am troubled that I do {{not know}} what <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> how {{grateful}} I am.

6000|$|... "You {{must come}} again; {{you must come}} to lunch, then <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> these by daylight, and my little sweet--she's a dear little thing. This dog {{seems to have taken}} a fancy to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Too proud! Pride {{will be your}} ruin; it goes {{before every}} sort of fall. Besides, I did write to you. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> {{a copy of the}} letter, if I haven't torn it up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Babbitt," [...] said Colonel Snow, [...] "we've {{come from}} the Good Citizens' League. We've decided {{we want you to}} join. Vergil Gunch says you don't care to, but <b>I</b> think we <b>can</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> a new light. The League is going to combine with the Chamber of Commerce in a {{campaign}} for the Open Shop, so it's time for you to put your name down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, nay; oh Holly," [...] she answered, [...] "it is no magic, that is {{a fiction}} of ignorance. There {{is no such thing}} as magic, though there is such a thing as a {{knowledge}} of the secrets of Nature. That water is my glass; in it I see what passes if I will to summon up the pictures, which is not often. Therein <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>show</b> <b>thee</b> what thou wilt of the past, if it be anything that hath to do with this country and with what I have known, or anything that thou, the gazer, hast known. Think of a face if thou wilt, and it shall be reflected from thy mind upon the water. I know not all the secret yet--I can read nothing in the future. But it is an old secret; I did not find it. In Arabia and in Egypt the sorcerers knew it centuries gone. So one day I chanced to bethink me of that old canal--some twenty ages since I sailed upon it, and I was minded to look thereon again. So I looked, and there I saw the boat and three men walking, and one, whose face I could not see, but a youth of noble form, sleeping in the boat, and so I sent and saved ye. And now farewell. But stay, tell me of this youth--the Lion, as the old man calls him. I would look upon him, but he is sick, thou sayest--sick with the fever, and also wounded in the fray." ...|$|R

And now I pass to {{the arts}} with which I have special concern, in which, though the facts are exactly the same, I shall have more {{difficulty}} in proving my assertion, because very few of us are as cognizant of the merit of painting as we are of that of language; and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> only <b>show</b> <b>you</b> whence that merit springs, after having thoroughly <b>shown</b> <b>you</b> in what it consists. But, in the meantime, I have simply to tell you, that the manual arts are as accurate exponents of ethical state, as other modes of expression; first, with absolute precision, of that of the workman; and then with precision, disguised by many distorting influences, of that of the nation to which it belongs.|$|R
