The practice began in 1999, when Curtis was doing some database consulting in Spartanburg, South Carolina.

5|$|The Trost {{brothers}} asked producer Brandon Barrera {{to act in}} {{the short}} film. After seeing their work, Barrera suggested that the brothers expand the premise into a feature film. The filmmakers placed an advertisement in the Mountain Enterprise, the Mountain Communities of the Tejon Pass's newspaper, encouraging community members to call <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> help with locations, catering, donations, or by serving as extras or crew members on the film.|$|E
5|$|A support {{fleet of}} more than 150 ships {{provided}} quarters, experimental stations, and workshops {{for most of the}} 42,000 men (more than 37,000 of whom were Navy personnel) and the 37 female nurses. Additional personnel were located on nearby atolls such as Eniwetok and Kwajalein. Navy personnel were allowed to extend their service obligation for one year <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> participate in the tests and see an atomic bomb explode. The islands of the Bikini Atoll were used as instrumentation sites and, until Baker contaminated them, as recreation sites.|$|E

5|$|Both coaches {{told the}} media that they {{believed}} their respective teams should play far better {{than they did in}} the National semifinal games <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> win the upcoming game. Coach Smith expressed concerns over Georgetown's shooting ability and feared that Floyd would come out shooting very well from the field. In addition, Smith noted that Ewing would play a large factor in the game because his defensive presence in the game limits second chance opportunities for Georgetown's opponents. Ken Rappoport of the Associated Press wrote of how North Carolina was a very disciplined team that takes only high-percentage shots.|$|E
5|$|Despite their success, Liverpool {{were not}} celebrating {{immediately}} after the match, as they had an important match in the Premier League on the Saturday following the final. The match against Charlton Athletic was a must-win match for Liverpool <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> finish in third place {{in the league and}} claim the final UEFA Champions League qualification place. The subsequent match was won 4–0 by Liverpool to secure their place in the 2001–02 UEFA Champions League. Winning the UEFA Cup entitled Liverpool to compete in the 2001 UEFA Super Cup against Champions League winners Bayern Munich. Liverpool won the match 3–2 to secure their second Super Cup victory.|$|E
5|$|Philip {{returned}} to Thessaly {{the next summer}} (either 353 or 352 BC, depending on the chronology followed), having gathered a new army in Macedon. Philip formally requested that the Thessalians join him {{in the war against}} the Phocians; the Thessalians, even if underwhelmed by Philip's performance the previous year, realistically had little choice <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> avoid being conquered by Onomarchus' army. Philip now mustered all the Thessalian opponents of Pherae that he could, and according to Diodorus, his final army numbered 20,000 infantry and 3000 cavalry.|$|E

5|$|The Eriksson {{brothers}} and Johansson {{did not work}} {{much more on the}} game until 1984, when the journalist Erik Fichtelius conducted an interview about the game for the Swedish airline Linjeflyg's magazine Upp, which was distributed to all their airplanes in 1985. In the article, Fichtelius asked Johansson why they had not made the game commercially available for home computers; Johansson said that it had been considered but that they had only developed the game because it was a fun challenge for them, and {{that they would have to}} find a distributor of computer programs <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> create a PC version.|$|E
5|$|Benfica began March with an away game in Braga. They lost 3–1 {{in their}} first league loss since December. They dropped to fourth place in the standings. On the {{following}} Saturday, Benfica visited Belenenses and lost {{for a second time}} in a row. A week later, Benfica received Paços de Ferreira at home. The match ended with a 3–2 win for the visitors and Benfica dropped to fifth place. They were now eleven points behind leader Boavista. In the last game of March, Benfica faced Campomaiorense on the road. With a 1–1 draw, the team avoided losing all of their matches in March. However, their need to get points was aggravated, especially <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> qualify for the European competitions.|$|E
5|$|By late November 1917, the Germans in East Africa {{were left}} with few options <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{continue}} the war. They were outnumbered drastically and were split up into several different columns. The two largest of these, under Theodor Tafel and Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck, were completely cut off from each other. Although von Lettow-Vorbeck's column had defeated a large British force at the Battle of Mahiwa he had lost {{a large number of}} troops and expended virtually his entire supply of modern ammunition. With only antiquated weapons and no way of resupplying, von Lettow-Vorbeck decided to invade Portuguese East Africa in hopes of acquiring sufficient supplies to continue the war. There was no legal impediment to this attack; Germany had declared war on Portugal on 9 March 1916.|$|E

5|$|Before the 1984 Winter Olympics, {{a dispute}} formed over what made a player a professional. The IOC had adopted {{a rule that}} made any player who had signed an NHL {{contract}} but played less than ten games in the league eligible. However, the United States Olympic Committee maintained that any player contracted with an NHL team was a professional and therefore not eligible to play. The IOC held an emergency meeting that ruled NHL-contracted players were eligible, {{as long as they}} had not played in any NHL games. This made five players on Olympic rosters—one Austrian, two Italians and two Canadians—ineligible. Players who had played in other professional leagues—such as the World Hockey Association—were allowed to play. Canadian hockey official Alan Eagleson stated that the rule was only applied to the NHL and that professionally contracted players in European leagues were still considered amateurs. Murray Costello of the CAHA suggested that a Canadian withdrawal was possible. In 1986, the IOC voted to allow all athletes to compete in Olympic Games starting in 1988, but let the individual sport federations decide <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> allow professionals.|$|E
5|$|During the Western Han, farming peasants {{formed the}} {{majority}} of those who were conscripted by the government to perform corvée labor or military duties. For the labor service (gengzu 更卒), males aged fifteen to fifty-six would be drafted for one month out of the year to work on construction projects and perform other duties in their commanderies and counties. For the military obligation (zhengzu 正卒), all males aged twenty-three were to train for one year in one of three branches of the military: infantry, cavalry, or navy. Until they reached age fifty-six, they were liable to perform one year of active service as troops sent to guard the frontiers from hostile nomads or to act as guards in the capital city. Significant changes were made to this system during Eastern Han; a commuting tax could be paid by peasants <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> avoid the one-month labor obligation, since hired labor became more popular in construction and other projects. The military service obligation could even be avoided if a peasant paid a commuting tax, since the Eastern Han military became largely a volunteer force. Other commoners such as merchants were also able to join the army.|$|E
5|$|Learning from {{a runner}} that the Phocians had not held the path, Leonidas called a council of war at dawn. According to Diodorus, a Persian called Tyrrhastiadas, a Cymaean by birth, warned the Greeks. Some of the Greeks argued for withdrawal, but Leonidas {{resolved}} {{to stay at}} the pass with the Spartans. Upon discovering that his army had been encircled, Leonidas told his allies that they could leave <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to.</b> While many of the Greeks took him up on his offer and fled, around two thousand soldiers stayed behind to fight and die. Knowing that the end was near, the Greeks marched into the open field and met the Persians head-on. Many of the Greek contingents then either chose to withdraw (without orders) or were ordered to leave by Leonidas (Herodotus admits that there is some doubt about which actually happened). The contingent of 700 Thespians, led by their general Demophilus, refused to leave and committed themselves to the fight. Also present were the 400 Thebans and probably the helots who had accompanied the Spartans.|$|E

5|$|Newly united {{as a team}} in ROH, the Briscoes began, in 2003, to {{feud with}} A.J. Styles and Amazing Red, then holders of the ROH Tag Team Championship, losing in title matches at Night of Champions, The Epic Encounter, and Death Before Dishonor, which by {{stipulation}} was their last match for the title {{for as long as}} Styles and Red held it. Before the last match, a poll was held on ROH's website, asking the fans <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see a third match between the two teams. Over 80% of respondents voted 'yes'. At Beating the Odds, they returned from a brief absence to score a pair of wins which were depicted in the storyline as being improbable, Mark over ROH veteran B.J. Whitmer and Jay in a Four Corner Survival match with ROH World Champion Samoa Joe, NWA World Heavyweight Champion A.J. Styles, and Chris Sabin, pinning Sabin to earn a future title shot at Joe. At ROH's Maryland debut, Tradition Continues, Joe retained over Jay.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} the {{junction}} with Tottenham Court Road suffered significant bomb damage during the Second World War. Patrick Abercrombie's contemporary Greater London Plan called for a new ring road around Central London called the 'A' Ring, but post-war budget constraints meant that a medley of existing routes were improved to form the ring road, including Euston Road. An underpass to avoid the junction with Tottenham Court Road was proposed in 1961, with construction taking place in 1964. The property developer Joe Levy was keen to develop buildings {{in the area and}} bought various properties. When the London County Council (LCC) refused planning permission because of the underpass development, Levy, who had outline planning permission, insisted the council pay him £1 million <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> compulsorily purchase the site. Over the next four years, Levy bought properties along the north side of Euston Road, and an agreement was reached so that the council built the underpass and he built a complex of two tower blocks with office shops and apartments, the Euston Tower.|$|E
5|$|The company's {{television}} stations, for {{the most}} part non–network affiliated, were known for showing classic films (both RKO productions and many others) under the banner of Million Dollar Movie, launched by New York's WOR-TV in 1954. In June 1962, RKO General and Zenith Electronics initiated what became the first extended venture into subscription television service: through early 1969, Hartford, Connecticut's WHCT-TV aired movies, sports, classical and pop music concerts, and other live performances without commercials, generating income from descrambler installation and weekly rental fees as well as individual program charges. However, RKO General's most notable legacy is what may be the longest licensing dispute in television history. It began in 1965, when General Tire was accused of obliging vendors to buy advertising with one of its stations <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> keep their contracts. More than two decades' worth of legal actions ensued, eventually forcing GenCorp (the parent company since 1983 of both General Tire and RKO General) to sell off its broadcast holdings under FCC pressure. RKO General exited the media business permanently in 1991.|$|E

5|$|Aristocrates, who was {{commanding}} a regiment of hoplites in Piraeus, {{arrested the}} extremist general Alexicles; enraged, the extremist {{leaders of the}} 400 demanded action, and {{made a number of}} threats against Theramenes and his party. To their surprise, Theramenes volunteered to lead a force to rescue Alexicles; the leaders of the extremists acquiesced, and Theramenes set out to Piraeus, sharing his command with one other moderate and one extremist, Aristarchus. When Theramenes and his force arrived at Piraeus, Aristarchus, in a rage, exhorted the men to attack the hoplites who had seized Alexicles. Theramenes feigned rage as well, but when asked by the hoplites whether he thought that the fortification on Eetioneia was a good idea, he responded that <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> pull it down, he thought that would be good. Calling out that everyone who wanted the 5,000 to govern instead of the 400, the hoplites set to work. Donald Kagan has suggested that this call was probably instigated by Theramenes' party, who wanted the 5,000 to govern; the hoplites tearing down the fortification might well have preferred a return to the democracy. Several days later, the Peloponnesian fleet approached Piraeus, but, finding the fortifications destroyed and the port well defended, they sailed on to Euboea. Several days later, the 400 were formally deposed and replaced by a government of the 5,000; the most extreme of the oligarchs fled the city.|$|E
5|$|In the 1973 state election, the LM largely ran a {{separate}} campaign from the LCL as a whole. The {{majority of the}} LCL's metropolitan candidates were also within the LM, and {{it was hoped that}} enough seats would be gained so that not only would the LCL return to power, but that the LM would be able to overpower the conservative faction in the House of Assembly and re-elect Hall as leader. To do this, they needed to capture at least three marginal Labor seats in Adelaide. This also meant the conservatives in the LCL would be better off losing to Labor <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> maintain their hold on the party, as Labor's vulnerable seats were in all in the city, and a Labor loss meant a LM gain. The LCL campaign chairperson explicitly said that she would prefer losing if it meant keeping control of the party. While the LM ran an innovative campaign, the LCL itself faltered, losing support in the country to {{a separate}} Country Party and to Labor in metropolitan Adelaide. One LM seat held by a rural member was lost to the Country Party. The LM were branded by the LCL conservatives as being the reason behind the LCL's defeat. The LM saw itself as a more modern and appropriate alternative to the LCL, more in tune with urban mainstream, but {{there was no evidence that}} urban LM candidates were more popular than conservative LCL candidates in Adelaide. LM members made up the majority of urban LCL candidates, but were unable to wrest any Labor seats in Adelaide.|$|E
