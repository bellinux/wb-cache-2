5000|$|In June 1827 some 600 Philadelphia <b>journeymen</b> {{carpenters}} — that is, {{the wage}} laborers employed by master carpenters — {{went on strike}} for the citywide establishment of the 10-hour day. This demand was immediately rejected by the organized master carpenters as [...] "inexpedient and altogether improper," [...] with the masters arguing that 20% of the working day would be lost without compensation under the system. This battle was protracted and solidified the association of the [...] "Journeymen House Carpenters," [...] while arousing the attention of other building trades to fight for a similar shortening of the work day. Within weeks the <b>journeymen</b> house painters and glaziers and <b>journeymen</b> bricklayers had been motivated to organize themselves around the 10-hour day demand and a new weekly newspaper called the <b>Journeymen</b> Mechanics' Advocate seems to have emerged.|$|R

In 1995–96 he played in the CBA with Rockford Lightning; he spent the next season back in France with Besançon, before returning to the Lightning in February 1997.

5|$|Freemasonry or Masonry {{consists}} of fraternal organisations that trace their origins {{to the local}} fraternities of stonemasons, which {{from the end of}} the fourteenth century regulated the qualifications of stonemasons and their interaction with authorities and clients. The degrees of freemasonry retain the three grades of medieval craft guilds, those of Apprentice, <b>Journeyman</b> or fellow (now called Fellowcraft), and Master Mason. These are the degrees offered by Craft (or Blue Lodge) Freemasonry. Members of these organisations are known as Freemasons or Masons. There are additional degrees, which vary with locality and jurisdiction, and are usually administered by different bodies than the craft degrees.|$|E

The bout was an Internet-only pay per view. As expected, Judah won the bout via 2nd-round TKO. Judah connected with power shots from the opening bell, landed a left hook to the head of Munguia in round 2 which dropped it on his back. The referee stopped the fight at 1 minute and 27 seconds of the round.|$|E

5|$|Portrait Diptych of Dürer's Parents (or Dürer's Parents with Rosaries) is the {{collective}} name for two late-15th century portrait panels by the German painter and printmaker Albrecht Dürer. They show the artist's parents, Barbara Holper (c. 1451–1514) and Albrecht Dürer the Elder (c. 1427–1502), {{when she was}} around 39 and he was 63 years. The portraits are unflinching records of {{the physical and emotional}} effects of ageing. The Dürer family was close and Dürer may have intended the panels either to display his skill to his parents or as keepsakes while he travelled soon after as a <b>journeyman</b> painter.|$|E

He was signed by Bolton Wanderers from Dudley Town in 1969 and spent nine years at Bolton, helping the club to win the Second Division title in 1977–78. He spent the 1980s as a <b>journeyman</b> player, spending time with Sunderland, Millwall, Tampa Bay Rowdies, Coventry City, Huddersfield Town, Bolton Wanderers (for a second spell), Preston North End, and West Bromwich Albion (also working as assistant manager). During this time he helped Preston to win promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1986–87.|$|E
5|$|Chapman's playing {{career was}} that of a typical <b>journeyman,</b> owing mostly to the fact he often played as an amateur; this meant that whether he could play for a {{particular}} club was dictated by whether he could find an appropriate job nearby. He first played as a youth for his local side, Kiveton Park Colliery, before leaving home in 1895. He moved to Ashton-under-Lyne and played as an amateur for Ashton North End, before moving on to Stalybridge Rovers and then Rochdale (not {{to be confused with the}} modern-day Rochdale A.F.C.) – all three clubs being members of the Lancashire League. Chapman played at inside right, and although he lacked the skill of his brother Harry, he compensated for it with his strength and robustness.|$|E
