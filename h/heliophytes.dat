40|$|In {{southern}} China, fengshui {{forests are}} distinctive woodlands that {{are treated as}} a protective barrier behind rural villages. Likely due to their socio-cultural importance to indigenous people, these forests have been conserved {{over the past several}} hundred years and {{play a significant role in}} conservation of local biodiversity. To reveal the effects of human disturbance on fengshui forests, we compared the species composition and diversity of understory woody plants among three fengshui forests with similar topographic situation and identical origin under different degrees of disturbance intensity in Dalingshan Town of Dongguan City, Guangdong Province. The low, medium and high disturbance level of fengshui forest stands were identified according to impact factors such as road length, agricultural land, residential area, factory area, cutting degree and garbage cover. Multi-response permutation procedures (MRPP) analysis showed that the composition of understory woody species (P = 0. 001, A = 0. 3886) differed among forest stands. Meanwhile, the proportion of mesophytes decreased with disturbance and the proportion of <b>heliophytes</b> increased. Though not statistically significant (P > 0. 05), diversity indices consistently showed the following trend: high disturbance > medium disturbance > low disturbance. Jaccard coefficients of understory species similarity among the three fengshui stands declined with increasing intensity of human disturbance, indicating that species replacementoccurred. Two-way cluster analysis of the relationships between plant species and forest stands indicated that the spatial distribution of understory species differed among stands. Indicator species analysis (ISA) identified species that were indicative (importance value ≥ 60) of the three forest stands studied, and therefore potential indicators of different disturbance regimes. We conclude that human disturbance of fengshui forests appeared to alter understory species composition, and favor the establishment and growth of <b>heliophytes,</b> but failed to affect species diversity. Furthermore, identification of candidate understory indicators which capture key ecological responses to human disturbance may have significant implications for improving biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management of fengshui forests...|$|E

In the last few years considerable amount of research has been done on the potential of aquatic macrophytes for pollutant removal or even as bio-indicators for heavy metals in aquatic ecosystems. Water hyacinth is one of the aquatic plant species successfully used for wastewater treatment. It is very efficient in removing pollutants like suspended solids, BOD, organic matter, heavy metals and pathogens. This paper mainly focuses on the treatment of waste water using the plant ‘water hyacinth ’ and has given emphasis to the removal of heavy metals by the plant. Water hyacinth ’ could grow in sewage; they absorb and digest the pollutants in wastewater, thus converting sewage effluents to relatively clean water. Thus, the plants hold promise as a natural water purification system, which could be established at a fraction of the cost of a conventional sewage treatment facility. The study conducted in this regard revealed how efficiently wastewater could be treated using the plant ‘Water hyacinth’.

40|$|Historians {{claim that}} European colonizers of the {{northern}} coast of Rio de Janeiro State found vast herbaceous fields when arrived in this region. Hypotheses {{about the origin of}} these fields include forest burning by the Goitacás indians and periodical floods by the Paraíba do Sul River and the lagoon system. The palynologycal analysis of two lake cores obtained in the municipality of Campos dos Goytacazes revealed opening episodes of hygrophilous forest and the establishment of field vegetation, recorded at ca. 6, 500 and ca. 4, 000 14 C yr BP. The partial replacement of forest by field vegetation in the first episode was probably caused by floods of the lower areas during the development of the Holocene lagoon phase. During the second episode, successions of vegetational patterns occurred due to lowering of the sea level. Drying and enlarging of the coastal plain have allowed its colonization by herbs and <b>heliophyte</b> plants.

30|$|It is {{generally}} recognized that light intensity {{plays an important}} role in plant growth and photosynthetic capacity (Gottschalk 1994). Insufficient light may stress plant growth by limiting photosynthesis, while high light levels may damage the photosynthetic apparatus (Tang et al. 2015). The present study demonstrated that shading had significant negative effects on leaf and total biomass production of C. paliurus coppices, while full light condition resulted in the highest growth for all the components, indicating that C. paliurus is a <b>heliophyte.</b> The observed growth response of C. paliurus to light intensity was similar to that of many tree species growing under various light intensities (Poorter 1999; Cai et al. 2009; Ma et al. 2015; Tang et al. 2015). The present study also indicated that leaf biomass ratio of C. paliurus increased at lower light intensity, whereas full sunlight increased the root and stem biomass ratios, respectively (Table  6). The reason might be that higher transpiration rate leads to increasing root biomass allocation in order to improve water uptake ability under full sunlight conditions, in agreement with that reported on Rauvolfia species, Anoectochilus formosanus Hayata, and freshwater macrophytes (Cai et al. 2009; Ma et al. 2010; Cronin and Lodge 2003).|$|R

K., a shrub {{or small}} {{tree in the}} Bignoniaceae, is a widely {{distributed}} polymorphic complex of the Western Hemisphere tropics and subtropics, and is commonly planted as an ornamental throughout the tropical world. Winter temperature limits its poleward distribution. The species is characteristic of rocky slopes, often limestone outcrops, but also alluvial and other substrata as long as drainage is excellent. In arid regions it occurs in climax xerophytic shrub or thorn forest communities, while in humid areas it is common mainly in deforested and other disturbed sites since it behaves as a <b>heliophyte.</b> The large yellow funnel-form flowers are pollinated by hummingbirds and perhaps also by some insects. The sensitive lobed stigma may favor cross-pollination, and neither dichogamy nor autogamy are usually shown. Extra-floral calyx nectaries which attract ants seem ineffective against corolla-base piercers. A low percentage of fruit is commonly set, drought and pollination failure probably being contributing factors. The pendant capsules contain many paper-thin wind-dispersed winged seeds, which have moderately high viability undiminished even after four years, and no dormancy. The strongly tap-rooted seedlings are often abundant in disturbed sites. The leaflet size class is microphyllous, and the species varies from evergreen to winter deciduous. It responds to drought partly by leaf abscission, but also by survival of prolonged permanent wilting, unusual for a thin-leaved mesomorph. Stump-sprouting is vigorous following cutting or fire, and browsing occurs in heavily-used pastures. No insect parasites or diseases are generally limiting...|$|R

Excavation of skeleton roots and observation of fine roots of seven species including the Euphorbiaceae, Theaceae, Melastomataceae, Lauraceae and Fagaceae families was carried out. The results showed that: (1) Pioneer tree roots in the first stage of natural succession were of two types, one characterized by taproot system with bulky plagiotropic branches; the other characterized by flat root system with several tabular roots. The late mesophilous tree roots were characterized by one obvious taproot and tactic braches roots up and down. Shrub species roots were characterized by heart fibrous root type featured both by horizontally and transversally growing branches. Root shapes varied in different dominant species at different stages of succession. (2) Roots of the different species varied in the external features—color, periderm and structure of freshly cut slash. (3) In a set of successional stages the biomass of tree roots increased linearly with the age of growth. During monsoon, the total root biomass amounted to 115. 70 t/ha in the evergreen broad-leaved forest; 50. 61 t/ha in needle and broad-leaved mixed forest dominated by coniferous forest; and 64. 20 t/ha in broad-and needle-leaved mixed forest dominated by broad-leaved <b>heliophytes,</b> and are comparable to the underground biomass observed in similar tropical forests.

40|$|In the dry {{forest of}} Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica, the {{understory}} shrub Jacquinia nervosa presents an inverse pattern of phenology that concentrates vegetative growth and reproduction {{during the dry}} season. In this study, we tested the "escape from herbivory" hypothesis as a potential explanation for the inverse phenological pattern of J. nervosa. We monitored leaf, flower and fruit production in 36 adult plants from October 2000 to August 2001. Leaves of six randomly selected branches per plant were marked and monitored every two weeks to measure the cumulative loss in leaf area. To analyze pre-dispersal seed predation we collected 15 fruits per plant and counted {{the total number of}} healthy and damaged seeds, as well as the number and type of seed predators found within the fruits. Leaf, flower, and fruit production occurred during {{the first part of the}} dry season (end of November to February). The cumulative herbivory levels were similar to those observed in other tropical dry forest tree species that concentrate leaf production during the wet season, and were concentrated on young leaves, which lost an average of 36. 77 % of their area (SD= 34. 35 %, N= 195). Chewing beetles of the genus Epicauta (Meloidae) were the most important herbivores. In mature leaves, most of the damage was caused by the beetle Coptocycla rufonotata (Chrysomelidae). Fruits took 4 months to develop during the dry season (January-March 2001) but continue increasing in size well into the first 3 months of the wet season (May-July). Average seed number per ripe fruit was 9 (SD = 5, N = 500). Seed predation in mature fruits was 42  % (SD = 47  %, N = 122). Most seeds were damaged by moth larvae of the family Tortricidae. Only 3  % of the flowers became fruits. This was influenced by the low level of flower synchrony (0. 38 ± 0. 26, N = 36 plants), but neither leaf synchrony (0. 88 ± 0. 06, N = 36 plants) nor plant size influenced fruit numbers. The significant damaged produced by insect herbivores in young leaves, fruits, and seeds, as well as the low reproductive index observed in J. nervosa, shows that the inverse leafing phenology of this species is not consistent with the "escape hypothesis" since J. nervosa was considerably attacked during the dry season. Considering the strong seasonality of the tropical dry forest and the <b>heliophyte</b> character of J. nervosa, it is more likely that this phenological strategy evolved in response to seasonal fluctuations in light availability, light quality, and daylength.

40|$|The {{sequence}} of Weichselian sediments and processes in SW Poland is {{almost identical to}} that of central Poland. Generally, three fluvial units occur, comprising silts and sands coarsening upwards to silts, sands and gravels, with aeolian deposits on top. This suggests very uniform processes throughout the palaeogeographic zone. To the south of this zone, there was extensive loess deposition and glacial deposition to the north. Climatic conditions during the Middle and Upper Weichselian Pleniglacial in SW Poland {{were similar to those}} in central Poland and northwestern Europe, though the period of 47 - 43 kyrs BP was slightly milder in SW Poland (shrub tundra, forest-tundra). Climatic conditions during the periods 38 - 27 kyrs BP and 23 - 18 kyrs BP were very uniform throughout central Europe, including SW Poland, though {{there may have been a}} strong north-south climatic gradient during the former period, as data from the loessic zone indicate at least patches of boreal forest or forest-tundra conditions in SW Poland at that time. It is also possible that there was a Middle Weichselian Pleniglacial interstadial with a lower age boundary at 25, 900 ą 700 years BP, characterised by Pinus-Picea forest with no <b>heliophytes.</b> This interstadial represents the last mild period before the advance of the late Weichselian ice sheet into SW Poland. The Weichselian fluvial deposition of SW and central Poland may have been punctuated by at least three major erosional phases, characterised by similar incision depths during the cold stages. Erosion took place, with certainty, at around 75 - 60 kyrs BP (Lower Pleniglacial) and 27 kyrs BP, very probably at around 23 / 22 kyrs and possibly at around 40 kyrs BP, and valley aggradation occurred during the milder stages. The Upper Pleniglacial was characterised by valley aggradation, associated with southward ice sheet advance and restricted fluvial outflow. However, the frequent Middle Pleniglacial Weichselian climatic oscillations did not initiate sedimentation and erosion, they controlled only river discharge and type of fluvial sedimentation and aeolian activity. The occurrence of the erosional and aggradational phases were controlled by the changes in ice volume in Scandinavia, ice sheet build-up and retreat, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Laminated {{sediment}} {{records from}} several maar lakes and dry maar lakes of the Eifel (Germany) reveal {{the history of}} climate, weather, environment, vegetation, and land use in central Europe during the last 60, 000 years. The time series of the last 30, 000 years {{is based on a}} continuous varve counted chronology, the MIS 3 section is tuned to the Greenland ice - both with independent age control from 14 C dates. Total carbon, pollen and plant macrofossils are used to synthesize a vegetation-stack, which is used together with the stacks from seasonal varve formation, flood layers, eolian dust content and volcanic tephra layers to define Landscape Evolution Zones (LEZ). LEZ 1 encompasses the landscape dynamics of the last 6000 years with widespread human influence. The natural oak and hazel forests of the early Holocene back to 10, 500 b 2 k define LEZ 2. LEZ 3, the late glacial between 10, 500 and 14, 700 b 2 k, shows the development of a boreal forest with abundant grass and shallow water biomass in the lakes. The maximum of the last glaciation (LEZ 4 : 14, 700 - 23, 000 b 2 k) was characterized by sparse vegetation of moss and characeae. These sediments are generally devoid of clay and sand and reveal no indication of snow-meltwater events. Accordingly, the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) must have been extremely arid in central Europe. The sediments of the subsequent LEZ 5 from 23, 000 - 28, 500 b 2 k preserve distinct layers of clay and coarse sand, which indicates running water with clay in suspension and ephemeral coarse-grained fluvial sediment discharge. Abundant Ranunculaceae macroremains (used for 14 C dating), insects, moss and fungi sclerotia reflect a tundra environment during a time of frequent strong snowmelt events. Total carbon content, Betula-Pinus pollen and diatoms reach increased concentrations during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 interstadials that occurred between 28, 500 and 36, 500 b 2 k (LEZ 6). The entire MIS 3 interstadials are well documented in the organic carbon record from the Auel dry maar. The main paleobotanical indicators of MIS 3 are, however, grass pollen and <b>heliophytes,</b> which indicate a steppe environment with scattered/patchy trees during the interstadials. The stadial phases inferred during LEZ 6 reveal initiation of eolian dust deflation. The change of the early MIS 3 forested landscape to a steppe occurred with the LEZ 7 -LEZ 6 transition. This is when modern man spread in central Europe. The principle vegetation change to a steppe at 36, 500 b 2 k must have favoured the spread of horses, an important hunting prey of modern humans. We propose accordingly that the migration of the modern humans into central Europe might have been at least partly driven by climate and associated vegetation change. The LEZ 7 encompassed the time interval 36, 500 to 49, 000 b 2 k and was characterized by a boreal forest with high abundance of pine, birch, as well as spruce during the interstadial events. Abundant charcoal fragments indicate that this taiga was under frequent drought stress with regular burning. The most unexpected finding, but corroborated by all our maar records is the dominance of thermophilous tree taxa from 49, 000 to 55, 000 b 2 k (LEZ 8). Greenland interstadials 13 and 14 were apparently the warmest of MIS 3 according to the Eifel pollen records. The preceeding LEZ 9 from 55, 000 to 60, 000 b 2 k is also dominated by spruce, but thermophilous trees were sparse. A warm early MIS 3 appears plausible, because summer insolation (at 60 ° N) was higher in the early MIS 3 than today, ice cover was low in Scandinavia and sea-surface temperatures of the North Atlantic were almost comparable to modern values during GI- 14...|$|E
