40|$|This study {{examines}} inhibition in preterm at {{eight months after}} expected <b>date</b> <b>of</b> delivery (when preterm infants were actually 10 - 11 months chronological age) and full-term infants at eight months. Inhibition emerges in infancy and continues to develop throughout childhood. Inhibition is believed to underlie some behavioral and learning problems in children at school age. Thirty-seven preterm infants without identified disabilities, and 74 due date and gender matched healthy full-term infants, participated in the present study. The preterm infants were all less than 32 weeks gestation and less than 1, 500 grams birthweight. All infants were therefore assessed on inhibition to prepotent response and inhibitioni to distraction of external stimuli tasks at 8 months after the expected <b>date</b> <b>of</b> delivery. The <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> the study showed that preterm infants performed significantly more poorly than full-term infants at both eight months corrected age and 10 - 11 month chronological age on measures of in inhibition to prepotent response and inhibitioni to distraction of external stimuli tasks.

40|$|Background: In recent years, {{several types}} of {{molecular}} markers and new microscale skeletal characters have shown potential as powerful tools for phylogenetic reconstructions and higher-level taxonomy of scleractinian corals. Nonetheless, discrimination of closely related taxa is still highly controversial in scleractinian coral research. Here we used newly sequenced complete mitochondrial genomes and 30 microsatellites to define the genetic divergence between two closely related azooxanthellate taxa of the family Caryophylliidae: solitary Desmophyllum dianthus and colonial Lophelia pertusa. Results: In the mitochondrial control region, an astonishing 99. 8 % of nucleotides between L. pertusa and D. dianthus were identical. Variability of the mitochondrial genomes of the two species is represented by only 12 non-synonymous out of 19 total nucleotide substitutions. Microsatellite sequence (37 loci) analysis of L. pertusa and D. dianthus showed genetic similarity is about 97 %. Our results also indicated that L. pertusa and D. dianthus show high skeletal plasticity in corallum shape and similarity in skeletal ontogeny, micromorphological (septal and wall granulations) and microstructural characters (arrangement of rapid accretion deposits, thickening deposits). Conclusions: Molecularly and morphologically, the solitary Desmophyllum and the dendroid Lophelia appear to be significantly more similar to each other than other unambiguous coral genera analysed to date. This consequently leads to ascribe both taxa under the generic name Desmophyllum (priority by <b>date</b> <b>of</b> publication). <b>Findings</b> <b>of</b> this study demonstrate that coloniality {{may not be a}} robust taxonomic character in scleractinian corals...|$|R

30|$|We know {{of only a}} {{few studies}} {{directly}} addressing the issue of subsidies/employment quotas for disabled workers. A paper by Humer et al. (2007) examines the impact of the Austrian Employment Act for the Disabled that grants extended employment protection, requires a hiring quota for firms, and subsidizes the employment of severely disabled (SD) workers. Estimating fixed effects regressions on disabled workers, they show that workers holding a job when acquiring legal SD-status have substantially better subsequent employment prospects after an SD-award than before, while the opposite is the case {{for those who do not}} hold a job at the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> SD-entry. These <b>findings</b> suggest that employment protection legislation places substantial firing costs on firms and has a major impact on the decisions of firms to hire disabled workers. The endogeneity of disability status is modeled as time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity captured via fixed effects. However, the SD award combines subsidies with other types of incentives to firms so it is difficult to conclude which part of the policy promotes employment of the disabled.|$|R

A checklist of 28 guidelines is provided to implement the Golden Rule. This article’s review of research found 150 experimental comparisons; all supported the guidelines. The average error reduction from following a single guideline (compared to common practice) was 28 percent.

30|$|Recently Ortner {{stated that}} “the {{presence}} of syphilis in the Old World before 1500  A.D. remains a very contentious issue…” [1]. For centuries researchers have discussed three main {{theories about the}} origin of syphilis. Especially one of the hypothesis, namely the existence of a pre-Columbian Treponema pallidum pallidum as the causative agent of venereal syphilis in the Old World has been and still is an on-going matter of dispute cf. [2 – 4]. The rash spread of the first sexually transmitted disease (STD) in Europe within a few years after AD 1493 has given cause for several discussions about its origin. Lack of evidence in the historical sources prior to this date suggests that venereal syphilis was completely unknown among the European population at that time. In accordance with the other European historical sources venereal syphilis {{does not seem to have}} reached Denmark prior to 1495 [5 – 7]. However, a precise year for the onset of the new disease cannot be given, especially because none of the sources were written prior to 1501 [8, 9]. Meyer et al.[10] explained the sudden numerous mentioning of a “new disease” in the literature with the invention of the printing press by Gutenberg in the middle of the 15 th century. They also mention the possibility of misdiagnoses with other known diseases prior to the 16 th century, which seems quite plausible since even today syphilis is called “the great imitator” [11], as its clinical manifestations in the human body are mimicking several other diseases [12]. The research of Harper and colleagues [13] disproved most of the alleged pre-Columbian <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> single <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> syphilis from the Old World and outlined the uncertain diagnosis <b>of</b> those <b>dated</b> before AD 1493. Only the Anglo-Saxon case described by Cole and Waldron [14] seems challenging and is according to Ortner [1] unlikely to be associated with a disease other than syphilis. There are however two possible finds of non-venereal treponemal disease from pre-Columbian England and Germany. Kuhnen et al.[15] present a case of possible treponarid in the skeleton of a knight from early 12 th century Germany; and Stirland [16] describes four adult individuals with treponemal bone changes, which Rothschild [17] determined as classical lesions <b>of</b> yaws.

The assessment of subtle developmental and behavioural delays in infants is complicated, and currently there are few sensitive measures available for the early identification of learning problems in infants. Conventional developmental assessment tools, for example, the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, only provide global indicators of development and fail to measure specific skills that may provide sensitive predictions of later learning. The assessment of specific cognitive skills, such as executive function (EF) rather than a global development score in infancy, has been advocated {{by a number of}} investigators Thirty-seven preterm infants without identified disabilities, and 74 due date and gender matched healthy full-term infants, participated in the present study. The preterm infants were all less than 32 weeks gestation and less than 1, 500 grams birthweight.
