40|$|The {{evolution}} of natural enemy defense shapes evolutionary trajectories of natural populations. Although {{the intensity of}} selection imposed by enemies clearly varies among natural populations, {{little is known about}} the reaction norm of genotypes under a gradient of selective pressure. In this study, we measure the quantitative responses of disease symptoms and plant fitness to a <b>gradient</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection,</b> focusing on the gene-for-gene interaction between the Rpm 1 resistance gene in Arabidopsis thaliana and the AvrRpm 1 avirulence gene in the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Two complementary sets of plant material were used: resistant (R) and susceptible (S) isogenic lines and a set of six natural accessions, three of which are Rpm 1 resistant (R) and three of which are rpm 1 susceptible (S). Nine initial pathogen densities were applied to each plant line. Using isogenic lines allows any differences between R and S lines to be attributed directly to the Rpm 1 gene, whereas using natural accessions allows the natural variation of resistance and tolerance over a <b>gradient</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> dosages within R and S accessions to be described. For both sets of plant material, increased infection dosage results in more extensive disease symptoms, with a subsequent decrease in seed production. The severity of disease symptoms was reduced in R relative to S subgroups, and the presence of the Rpm 1 allele led to an increase in plant fitness. Tolerance, defined as the ability to sustain infection without a reduction in fitness, was directly affected by Rpm 1, providing a novel demonstration of an R gene affecting tolerance. Genetic variation for tolerance was also found within the S and R natural accessions, suggesting the potential for selection to act upon this important trait...|$|E
40|$|Alveolar Echinococcosis is {{a lethal}} {{zoonosis}} transmitted to humans by the ingestion of eggs of the tænia Echinococcus multilocularis. The {{cycle of the}} parasite needs a carnivore as definitive host (mainly the red fox) and the common and water voles (Microtus arvalis and Arvicola terrestris) as intermediate hosts. Since 20 years, the more and more common observations of urban foxes gave rise to many questions about the possible increased risk of transmission to man due to the proximity of foxes. Recent studies showed the presence of E. multilocularis in urban foxes with variable prevalence. However, {{the conditions of the}} development of this parasite in the urbanized area are few documented. Work presented here proposes to improve comprehension of the cycle of E. multilocularis in such urbanized area. A monitoring of the red fox infection by collection of road kills or trapped animals highlighted a "rural to urban" decreasing <b>gradient</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection.</b> Along this gradient, different habitats were regularly sampled; this study showed the importance for the red fox of the availability of Microtus sp. in waste land landscape. The study of the adaptation of its diet by red fox to the variations of rodents densities showed that the Microtus sp. was highly consumed even when it was poorly represented in the field whereas in peri-urban area, A. terrestris,is consumed according to its availability. Taking in account the availability of rodents on the scale of the city, it was shown that the consumption of intermediate hosts is more important in rural area than in urban area and that the rural diet exhibits a predominance of Microtus sp. versus A. terrestris whereas these differences are lacking in urban area. The distribution of faeces of the red fox appeared correlated with the densities of Microtus sp and A. terrestris, underlining the possibilities of closing the parasitic cycle whatever the urbanization level. Lastly, the study of foxes movements using GPS collars has allowed to observe various types of behaviours which could induce a modulation in the space dynamics of the urban transmission of the parasite based on the stability of the local red fox populations. L'Echinococcose Alveolaire est une zoonose mortelle transmise a l'Homme par l'ingestion des oeufs du tænia Echinococcus multilocularis. Le cycle du parasite fait intervenir un carnivore comme hote definitif (principalement le renard roux) et des campagnols prairiaux (Microtus arvalis et Arvicola terrestris) comme hotes intermediaires. Depuis une vingtaine d'annees, les observations de plus en plus frequentes de renards urbains ont suscite de nombreuses questions sur l'augmentation du risque de contamination humaine a cause de cette proximite des renards. Des etudes recentes ont montre la presence d'E. multilocularis chez le renard urbain avec des prevalences tres variables. Cependant, les conditions du developpement de ce parasite dans les milieux urbanises sont peu documentees. Les travaux presentes proposent d'ameliorer la comprehension du cycle d'E. multilocularis dans de tels milieux. Un suivi de l'infection vulpine par collecte de cadavres a mis en evidence un gradient d'infection decroissant du milieu rural au milieu urbain. Le long de ce gradient, differents milieux ont ete regulierement echantillonnes et ont montre l'importance pour le renard roux de la disponibilite en Microtus sp. dans les milieux friches. L'etude de la reponse alimentaire du renard roux aux variations de densites de rongeurs a montre que Microtus sp. etait fortement consomme meme lorsqu'il etait faiblement present sur le terrain alors que A. terrestris, en milieu peri-urbain, est consomme selon sa disponibilite. L'etude de la disponibilite en rongeurs a l'echelle de la ville montre que la consommation en hotes intermediaires est plus importante en milieu rural qu'en milieu urbain et que le regime alimentaire rural se caracterise par une predominance de Microtus sp. par rapport a A. terrestris alors que ces differences sont pas presentes en milieu urbain. La repartition des feces de renard roux est correlee aux densites de Microtus sp et d'A. terrestris, soulignant les possibilites d'existence du cycle parasitaire quel que soit le niveau d'urbanisation. Enfin, l'etude de trajectoires de renards par utilisation de colliers GPS a permis d'observer differents types de comportements individuels qui pourraient entrainer une modulation de la dynamique spatiale de la transmission urbaine du parasite basee sur la stabilite des populations vulpines...|$|E

The present study aimed to examine the crosstalk of commensals and periodontopathogens in human oral keratinocytes (HOKs) and THP- 1 monocytes. Methods: The commensal oral bacteria including Streptococcus mutans (Sm), Streptococcus mitis (Smi) and Streptococcus sanguinis (Ss), and periodontopathogens including Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) were Selected. The interaction of bacteria with HOKs and THP- 1 cells was analyzed in a co-culture model using a <b>gradient</b> <b>of</b> multiplicity <b>of</b> <b>infection.</b> The expression <b>of</b> IL- 1 b, IL- 6, IL- 8 and TNF-¦Á was assessed using ELISA and real-time qPCR.

Results: The commensals upregulated the pro-inflammatory cytokines expression in both HOKs and THP- 1 monocytes. In contrast, periodontopathogens induced higher levels of cytokines expression in HOKs, while in monocytes Pg down-regulated the TLR-mediated immuno-inflammatory response. THP- 1 was more responsive to Smi and Ss in terms of IL- 8 and TNF-¦Á production, and to Sm and Smi in terms of IL- 1 b than the controls and that treated with Pg (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Neutrophils {{constitute}} the largest class of {{white blood cells}} and are the first responders in the innate immune response. They are able to sense and migrate up concentration <b>gradients</b> <b>of</b> chemoattractants in search of primary sites <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> and inflammation through {{a process known as}} chemotaxis. These chemoattractants include formylated peptides and various chemokines. While much is known about chemotaxis to individual chemoattractants, far less is known about chemotaxis towards many. Previous studies have shown that in opposing <b>gradients</b> <b>of</b> intermediate chemoattractants (interleukin- 8 and leukotriene B 4), neutrophils preferentially migrate toward the more distant source. In this work, we investigated neutrophil chemotaxis in opposing <b>gradients</b> <b>of</b> chemoattractants using a microfluidic platform. We found that primary neutrophils exhibit oscillatory motion in opposing <b>gradients</b> <b>of</b> intermediate chemoattractants. To understand this behavior, we constructed a mathematical model of neutrophil chemotaxis. Our results suggest that sensory adaptation alone cannot explain the observed oscillatory motion. Rather, our model suggests that neutrophils employ a winner-take-all mechanism that enables them to transiently lock onto sensed targets and continuously switch between the intermediate attractant sources as they are encountered. These findings uncover a previously unseen behavior of neutrophils in opposing <b>gradients</b> <b>of</b> chemoattractants that will further aid in our understanding of neutrophil chemotaxis and the innate immune response.

No differences in infection or transmission rates were found between the Cx. p. pipiens populations with both infection methods, but WNV transmission rates were significantly higher at temperatures above 18 °C.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we measured the prevalence and severity <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> with intestinal coccidians (Isospora sp.) and the canarypox virus (Avipoxvirus) along an urban-to-rural gradient in wild male house finches (Haemorhous mexicanus).
