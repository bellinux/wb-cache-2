The prospective buyer hires a qualified evaluator who examines the target vehicle for defects, <b>hidden</b> <b>damage,</b> maintenance history, and safety, then typically provides a written evaluation report. The service results in factual information that the prospective buyer uses as decision support for the vehicle purchase.

40|$|Abstract. This article {{deals with}} results of testing, {{what level of}} {{reliability}} and accuracy {{can be reached by}} GPS devices and cameras when using them for purposes of detection of extreme braking and determination of its parameters. Braking tests with van and with semi-trailer truck were done for purposes of this research. The main target is to find out, whether this equipment can be used for detection of extreme braking as a situation, which can cause <b>hidden</b> <b>damages</b> on transported cargo. This article contains evaluation of differences between data measured by GPS equipment and those measured by equipment with accelerometer. There are also stated examples of runs of braking deceleration as there were recorded by particular types of equipment. Description of Braking Tests Done and Equipment Used for this Research The aim {{of this paper is to}} research the reliability and accuracy of finding out braking parameters, such as initial speed of braking, braking duration, braking track and braking deceleration (maximum and average) with using GPS equipment and cameras. Nowadays, the GPS equipment is very often used for monitoring cargo vehicles movement.

40|$|Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) {{materials}} generally {{respond with}} <b>hidden</b> <b>damage</b> to an impact event.

CFRP specimens impacted at different energy in the range from 1. 8 up to 19. 3 J have been analized.

40|$|Structural {{ceramics}} like alumina {{are usually}} brittle and sensitive to flaws {{leading to a}} reduction in their mechanical properties. This situation is worsened by machining prior to service and during service by contact, which introduces micro cracks and <b>hidden</b> <b>damages.</b> Crack damage can easily be developed in such ceramics when loaded, which often leads to catastrophic failure. However, if sacrificial SiC healing particles are embedded into the matrix of alumina, then the cracks can be healed by exposure at high temperatures in an oxidizing environment. Then, the cracks are filled with SiO 2 restoring the strength of the composite and thereby prolonging its lifetime. Reducing the size of the SiC healing particles while keeping the volume fraction the same, will increase the efficiency and lowers the onset temperature of the oxidation induced crack healing.
