500|$|After another boring week in his life, Bart sees a {{commercial}} on television for a fun cruise and begs Homer and Marge {{for a family}} vacation. They tell him that the family is low on cash, so Bart chooses to sell everything he owns to fund the vacation himself. He comes up well short of the needed amount, so Marge and Lisa help by selling one valuable item apiece. Together the three {{have enough money to}} book the family into an economy cabin; once the cruise starts, though, a series of free upgrades places them in a deluxe cabin. They enjoy the wide range of activities onboard, but Bart's spirits sink when he hears the cruise director, Rowan Priddis, sing a song to the passengers telling them to <b>enjoy</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the cruise while they can before they go back to their normal lives. Bart fears that the remainder of his life will be painfully boring and decides to make the vacation last forever.|$|E

[...] Ramin Setoodeh of Newsweek gave a negative review, writing, [...] "They've taken one of the most enchanting series in contemporary fiction and sucked out all the magic [...] [...] [...] while Rowling's stories are endlessly inventive, Potter onscreen just gives you a headache."
