5|$|The Portuguese {{assault was}} {{thoroughly}} prepared. The plan was for six Portuguese squadrons under dom João <b>da</b> <b>Silva</b> {{to block the}} entrance to the bridge, isolating the redoubt from Fort San Crisóbal. The fort would in turn be attacked by Alfonso Futrado and Simon Correa <b>da</b> <b>Silva.</b> Maestre de Campo dom Diogo Gomes was given the task of cutting the communication lines along the Guadiana river and Pedro Almado of distracting several minor forts nearby. Some cavalry regiments were deployed in the expectation of a fierce Spanish resistance.|$|E
5|$|The {{apartment}} block {{was not a}} gated complex. Located {{on the corner of}} Rua Dr Agostinho <b>da</b> <b>Silva</b> and Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins, 5A was accessible to the public from two sides. Sliding glass patio doors in the living room at the back overlooked the Ocean Club's pool, tennis courts, tapas restaurant and bar. The patio doors could be accessed via a public street, Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins, where a small gate and set of steps led to 5A's balcony and living room. 5A's front door was {{on the opposite side of}} the block from the Ocean Club, on Rua Dr Agostinho <b>da</b> <b>Silva.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although no statute {{was passed}} during the {{imperial}} period to declare Francisco Manuel <b>da</b> <b>Silva's</b> musical composition {{as the national}} anthem, no formal enactment was considered necessary for {{the adoption of a}} national anthem. A national anthem was seen as resulting from praxis or tradition. Thus, by 1837, when it was played in all official solemnities, Francisco Manuel <b>da</b> <b>Silva's</b> composition was already the Brazilian National Anthem.|$|R

5|$|From the 15th century, {{changes to}} the areas {{surrounding}} Santa María de Óvila initiated a slow decline. Civil wars depopulated the villages of the upper Tagus valley.

Stage wins {{were achieved}} by {{nine of the}} twenty competing squads, six of which won multiple stages. Del Tongo-Colnago collected {{a total of five}} wins through the team time trial, Saronni, Bombini (stage 5), and Hoste (stage 6). Atala-Ofmega-Campagnolo amassed a total of four stage wins through Freuler and Gisiger (stage 17). Malvor-Bottecchia also secured four stage wins through <b>da</b> <b>Silva</b> and Allocchio. Sammontana-Bianchi obtained two stage victories with Rosola. Gis Gelati-Trentino Vacanze collected two stage successes with Moser. 7-Eleven recorded two stage wins with Kiefel (stage 15) and Hampsten (stage 20). Cilo-Aufina, Alpilatte-Olmo-Cierre, and La Vie Claire all won a single stage at the Giro, the first through Seiz (stage 4), the second through Maini (stage 7), and the third by Hinault (stage 12), and the fourth with Chioccioli (stage 14).|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: <b>Da</b> <b>Silva’s</b> cone repair {{is a novel}} {{technique}} for surgical reconstruction of the tricuspid valve and the right ventricle (RV) in Ebstein’s anomaly. The technique consists of extensive leaflet mobilization, longitudinal plication of the atrialized ventricle and cone-shaped reconstruction of the tricuspid valve, allowing for leaflet-to-leaflet coaptation. We evaluated the influence of <b>Da</b> <b>Silva’s</b> cone repair on tricuspid competency, right ventricular size and function. METHODS: From February 2010 until July 2013, 20 patients (median age 30. 0 years, range 6. 6 – 68. 3 years) underwent <b>Da</b> <b>Silva’s</b> cone repair. A 4 - to 6 -mm interatrial communication was left in all patients. Echocardiographic studies and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) {{before and after the}} repair were evaluated. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 11 (0. 5 – 36) months. There were 2 early deaths and no late death. Echocardiography at follow-up revealed mild or absent tricuspid regurgitation in 16 patients. Two patients showed moderate tricuspid insufficiency. MRI studies showed that th...|$|R

5|$|In 2000, James Patton, Maria <b>da</b> <b>Silva,</b> and Jay Malcolm {{reported}} on mammals {{collected at the}} Rio Juruá in western Brazil. In this report, they provided further information on the Oryzomys species reviewed by Musser and colleagues, including sequence data from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Their analysis reaffirmed that O.emmonsae was a distinct species {{and found that it}} was closest to O.macconnelli and O.russatus, differing from both by about 12% in the cytochrome b sequence; O.nitidus was more distantly related, differing by 14.7%. The average sequence difference between the three O.emmonsae studied was 0.8%.|$|E
5|$|In the race's sixth stage, Roberto Visentini won the leg after {{attacking a}} few {{kilometers}} from the finish. Saronni regained the race lead after finishing second {{on the stage and}} earning a fifteen-second time bonus. The next two stages both resulted in a bunch sprint, with Guido Bontempi winning stage 7 and Franco Chioccioli, stage 8. The ninth stage contained the climbs of Monte Terminillo and La Forca and was considered one of the tougher stages in the race. Malvor-Bottecchia-Vaporella rider Acácio <b>da</b> <b>Silva</b> won the stage as the top of the general classification rankings remained unchanged from the previous days.|$|E

5|$|Pedra da Gávea is a {{mountain}} in Tijuca Forest, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Differential weathering {{on one side}} of the rock has created what is described as a stylized human face.
