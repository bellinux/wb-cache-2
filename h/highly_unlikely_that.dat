5|$|In 1812, when it {{appeared}} <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> the King would recover, the Prince of Wales again failed to appoint a new Whig administration. Instead, he asked the Whigs to join the existing ministry under Perceval. The Whigs, however, refused to co-operate because of disagreements over Catholic emancipation. Grudgingly, the Prince of Wales allowed Perceval to continue as Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> Nicholas {{was born}} {{later than the}} 1230s, as he was styled Magister by 1259, {{indicating}} that by that date he possessed a Master's degree.

5|$|Despite {{its initial}} plausibility, the {{identity}} theory faces a strong {{challenge in the}} form of the thesis of multiple realizability, first formulated by Hilary Putnam. It is obvious that not only humans, but many different species of animals can, for example, experience pain. However, it seems <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> all of these diverse organisms with the same pain experience are in the identical brain state. And if this is the case, then pain cannot be identical to a specific brain state. The identity theory is thus empirically unfounded.|$|E

50|$|Sequential monomer {{addition}} is {{the dominant}} method in the literature, mainly due to its simplicity. Nevertheless, also this concepthas serious limitations. For example, for a given set of three monomers (A, B, and C), sequential living anionic polymerization can afford allpossible linear BC structures (i.e., ABC, ACB, and BAC)exclusively in the <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> scenario <b>that</b> the following requirements are fulfilled: (a) similar monomer reactivity, (b) high crossover efficiency, and (c) absence of side reactions.|$|R
40|$|The recent {{relaxation}} of the cap in university fees for undergraduates has seen most universities set their fees at the maximum of £ 9, 000. The {{soon to be}} released Higher Education White Paper is set to abolish university quotas for students with high A level grades, {{with the hope that}} this may drive down fees. Tim Leunig finds that the policy is unworkable, and argues that lower fees are <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely,</b> given <b>that</b> demand for places at elite universities is very high...|$|R
5|$|Francium-223 is {{the most}} stable isotope, with a {{half-life}} of 21.8minutes, and it is <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> an isotope of francium with a longer half-life will ever be discovered or synthesized. Francium-223 is the fifth product of the actinium decay series as the daughter isotope of actinium-227. Francium-223 then decays into radium-223 by beta decay (1149keV decay energy), with a minor (0.006%) alpha decay path to astatine-219 (5.4MeV decay energy).|$|E
5|$|Mathematically, the {{smallest}} possible object that could possess an absolute magnitude of +1 (a perfectly reflective {{one with an}} albedo of 1) would be 838km in diameter. It is <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> any body of this size or larger, regardless of composition, would not also surpass whatever threshold is ultimately adopted as proof of hydrostatic equilibrium. However, {{if it turns out}} upon further investigation that an object named {{as if it were a}} plutoid has not achieved hydrostatic equilibrium, the IAU has stated it will be reclassified, but keep its name.|$|E
5|$|Most modern {{historians have}} exonerated Robert Dudley from murder or a cover-up. Apart from {{alternatives}} for a murder plot as causes for Amy Robsart's death, his correspondence with Thomas Blount and William Cecil {{in the days}} following has been cited as proofs of his innocence; the letters, which show signs of an agitated mind, making clear his bewilderment and unpreparedness. It has also been judged as <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> he would have orchestrated the death of his wife in a manner which laid him open to such a foreseeable scandal.|$|E
50|$|In 1828, Washington Irving's highly romanticised biography, A History of the Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus, was {{published}} and mistaken by many for a scholarly work. In Book II, Chapter IV of this biography, Irving gave a largely fictional {{account of the}} meetings of a commission established by the Spanish sovereigns to examine Columbus's proposals. One of his more fanciful embellishments was a <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> tale <b>that</b> the more ignorant and bigoted members on the commission had raised scriptural objections to Columbus's assertions that the Earth was spherical.|$|R
5000|$|Despite this failure, he {{was soon}} {{entrusted}} with another important mission, being sent to Sicily as its strategos to counter the rebellion and defection of the local tourmarches Euphemius to the Aghlabids of Ifriqiya. He was probably the successor of the strategos Constantine Soudas, whom Euphemius had killed, but some scholars equate the two men. Greek historian Christos Makrypoulias {{on the other hand}} estimates <b>that</b> this is <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely,</b> and <b>that</b> he must have been appointed strategos in Sicily before the expedition to Crete. Nothing is known of him after his dispatch to the island.|$|R
40|$|Accidents {{could occur}} during the {{transportation}} of {{spent nuclear fuel}} and high-level radioactive waste. This paper describes the risks and consequences to the public from accidents <b>that</b> are <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> but <b>that</b> could have severe consequences. The impact of these accidents would include those to a collective population and to hypothetical maximally exposed individuals (MEIs). This document discusses accidents with conditions that {{have a chance of}} occurring more often than 1 in 10 million times in a year, called ''maximum reasonably foreseeable accidents''. Accidents and conditions less likely than this are not considered to be reasonably foreseeable...|$|R
5|$|The ancient Egyptians mummified many animal species, from {{cats and}} gazelles to crocodiles, baboons, and birds. Typically, many animal species were {{consumed}} as meat after death, {{but it is}} <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> dogs would have been eaten. Radiographs of exhumed dogs {{in the ancient world}} have revealed that the mummification process involved wrapping the embalmed bones together with bandages and placing them within a wooden statue of Anubis, the jackal-headed deity associated with mummification and the afterlife in ancient Egyptian religion.|$|E
5|$|There {{are seven}} Pacific Coast {{breakpoints}} in the United States. They are, {{from north to}} south, Point Piedras Blancas, Point Sal, Point Conception, Point Mugu, {{the mouth of the}} San Gabriel River, San Mateo Point, and the mouth of the Tijuana River (although places outside this area can be selected if conditions warrant). Should there be the threat of landfall, warnings or watches would be issued for those sections of coast. It is <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> any tropical cyclone will threaten areas farther north due to the stronger influence of the California Current.|$|E
5|$|However, it is <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> single-story {{structures}} such as {{mobile homes}} can have a substantial effect on tornado development or evolution. More people are killed in trailer parks because mobile homes are less able to withstand high winds than permanent structures. Winds which can demolish or roll a mobile home may only cause roof damage to a typical one- or two-family permanent residence. Another likely contributing factor to the continued propagation of this myth is confirmation bias: whenever a new instance of a tornado hitting a mobile home park occurs, media outlets report on it more extensively, ignoring damage to the surrounding area which may not have produced as many casualties.|$|E
50|$|When two {{populations of}} any sexual {{organism}} are separated and kept isolated from each other, {{the frequencies of}} deleterious mutations in the two populations will differ over time, by genetic drift. It is <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely,</b> however, <b>that</b> the same deleterious mutations will be common in both populations after {{a long period of}} separation. Since loss-of-function mutations tend to be recessive (given that dominant mutations of this type generally prevent the organism from reproducing and thereby passing the gene on to the next generation), the result of any cross between the two populations will be fitter than the parent.|$|R
50|$|The wealthy class' {{ability to}} pay for {{extraordinary}} measures that mitigate their flight risk is also an issue with several suggested fixes. The solution is to directly amend the Bail Reform Act of 1984 to explicitly prohibit this sort of unfair treatment, {{and there are two}} proposed amendments. The first is to award everyone pretrial release regardless of their {{ability to pay}}, and the second is to cease the practice of permitting the wealthy to pay for their pretrial release. The former, though most egalitarian, is <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely,</b> given <b>that</b> it is impractical to assume that the government will take responsibility for the costs that this would entail.|$|R
50|$|Modern historians find Arrian's {{count of}} 600,000 men <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely.</b> They argue <b>that</b> the {{logistics}} of fielding more than 100,000 soldiers in battle was extremely difficult at the time. Hans Delbrück gives an estimate as small as 25,000, although most (including Engels and Green) estimate the total size of Darius' army to be no larger than 100,000 at Issus, including 11,000 cavalry, 10,000 Persian Immortals, and 10,000 Greek mercenaries. Warry estimates 108,000 in total.|$|R
5|$|In September 2005, an Israeli-declared AIDS expert {{claimed that}} Arafat bore all the {{symptoms}} of AIDS based on obtained medical records. But others, including Patrice Mangin of the University of Lausanne and The New York Times disagreed with this claim, insisting that Arafat's record indicated that it was <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> {{the cause of his}} death was AIDS. Arafat's personal doctor Ashraf al-Kurdi and aide Bassam Abu Sharif maintained that Arafat was poisoned, possibly by thallium. A senior Israeli physician concluded that Arafat died from food poisoning. Both those claims were rejected by Haaretz and The New York Times. Then-Palestinian foreign minister Nabil Shaath had also ruled out poisoning after talks with Arafat's French doctors.|$|E
5|$|However, {{by then it}} {{had become}} clear that Frogner west of Solli plass would remain dominantly a {{residential}} area. The estimates showed that the station would capture few new riders and instead simply give a shorter walk for {{a small minority of}} those who used Nationaltheatret Station and Skøyen Station. With the upgraded Nationaltheatret Station, which opened in 1999, the capacity of the Oslo Tunnel increased from 16 to 24 trains per hour in each direction, because the station from then had four, rather than two, tracks. A similar upgrade would need to be done for Elisenberg Station, should it be taken into use, or the capacity of the tunnel would again be reduced. It is therefore <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> the station will ever be opened. In 1998, the readers of the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten proposed making Elisenberg an emergency exit.|$|E
5|$|Oganesson is {{expected}} to have by far the broadest polarizability of all elements before it in the periodic table, almost double that of radon. By extrapolating from the other noble gases, it {{is expected}} that oganesson has a boiling point between 320 and 380 K. This {{is very different from the}} previously estimated values of 263K or 247 K. Even given the large uncertainties of the calculations, it seems <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> oganesson would be a gas under standard conditions, and as the liquid range of the other gases is very narrow, between 2 and 9 kelvins, this element should be solid at standard conditions. If oganesson forms a gas under standard conditions nevertheless, it would be one of the densest gaseous substances at standard conditions, even if it is monatomic like the other noble gases.|$|E
50|$|The {{government}} broadcast announcements asking all {{soldiers to}} stay at their own cantonment. After some hours, Mymensing Division soldiers returned to their barracks. The Chittagong Division never mobilized towards Dhaka. The General Officer Commanding of the Chittagong Division realized that the military coup was <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> to succeed. <b>That</b> night Nasim was interviewed by the BBC and, in reference to troop movements, he said that as Army Chief, he could move troops any time he wanted.|$|R
25|$|While the Romans {{had been}} {{steadily}} expanding their territory {{for over a}} century, their army had never fought a battle outside of the Italian Peninsula. Carthage's control of an invasion route into Italy threatened Rome's newly conquered territory in southern Italy as well as Rome itself. In 264 BC, the Roman Senate voted to send an expedition to Sicily {{under the command of}} Appius Claudius Caudex, one of the consuls for that year. Whether the Centuriate Assembly of Rome formally declared war is disputed. Adrian Goldsworthy has maintained <b>that</b> it was <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely,</b> and <b>that,</b> although the Romans knew war with Syracuse was almost a certainty, they believed their military would deter or swiftly defeat any opposition in Sicily.|$|R
50|$|Tsumeb, {{since its}} founding, has been {{primarily}} a mining town. The mine was originally {{owned by the}} OMEG (Otavi Minen- und Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft) and later by TCL (Tsumeb Corporation Limited) before its closure a few years ago, when the ore at depth ran out. The main shafts became flooded by ground water over a kilometre deep and the water was collected and pumped {{as far as the}} capital, Windhoek. The mine has since been opened up again by a group of local entrepreneurs ("Ongopolo Mining"). A fair amount of oxidized ore remains to be recovered in the old upper levels of the mine. It is <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely,</b> though, <b>that</b> the deepest levels will ever be reopened.|$|R
5|$|Psittacosaurus is {{the type}} genus of the family Psittacosauridae, which was also named by Osborn in 1923. Psittacosaurids were basal to almost all known ceratopsians except Yinlong and perhaps the Chaoyangsauridae. While Psittacosauridae was an early branch of the ceratopsian family tree, Psittacosaurus itself was {{probably}} not directly ancestral to any other groups of ceratopsians. All other ceratopsians retained the fifth digit of the hand, a plesiomorphy or primitive trait, whereas all species of Psittacosaurus had only four digits on the hand. In addition, the antorbital fenestra, {{an opening in the}} skull between the eye socket and nostril, was lost during the evolution of Psittacosauridae, but is still found in most other ceratopsians and in fact most other archosaurs. It is considered <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> the fifth digit or antorbital fenestra would evolve a second time.|$|E
5|$|The coins {{struck by}} Beonna's last known moneyer, Wilred, are so {{different}} from Efe's that it is <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> they were produced at the same mint or at the same time. It can also be assumed that Wilred is the same moneyer who struck coins for Offa of Mercia, possibly at Ipswich. Wilred's coins {{can be used to}} demonstrate that Offa's influence over the East Angles occurred at an earlier date than has previously been supposed, but are of little use in determining a secure chronology for Beonna's reign. Wilred's name is always depicted in runes. Nearly all his reverse dies have two crosses placed between the elements of his name (+ wil + red): most of the obverse dies show crosses and the king's name in a similar design, but also include an extra rune. This unique rune, similar to ᚹ, possibly meant walda ('ruler').|$|E
5|$|Thucydides {{says that}} 200 Phoenician ships were {{captured}} and destroyed. It is <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> this {{occurred during the}} apparently brief naval battle, so these were probably grounded ships captured after the battle and destroyed with fire, {{as has been the}} case at Mycale. Plutarch says that 200 ships were captured, in addition to those that were destroyed or fled. It is possible that 'destroyed' in this context means sunk during the battle, since the Greeks would almost certainly have destroyed the ships that they captured as well (as Thucydides indeed implies). Since Thucydides only explicitly gives the number of ships destroyed, it is possible to reconcile Plutarch's and Thucydides's numbers, {{but it is not clear}} that this is the best approach. There are no estimates in the ancient sources for casualties amongst the troops of either side.|$|E
5000|$|Subsequently {{questions}} were raised concerning Young’s claim and {{the photograph of}} the new parrot {{that had been made}} available to the media. Ornithologists Penny Olsen and Richard Schodde expressed doubts, with Olsen finding the photograph unconvincing, and with Schodde saying that, until there was proper documentation and the claim confirmed by more than one independent qualified observer, the report should be disregarded. [...] Schodde later said that the existence of two very closely related parrots living side by side in remnant patches of rainforest around the Queensland - New South Wales border was <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely,</b> concluding <b>that,</b> without further evidence such as DNA material, Young's claim should be treated with [...] "utmost scepticism".|$|R
5000|$|Many in the {{scientific}} community believe that backward time travel is <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely.</b> Any theory <b>that</b> would allow time travel would introduce potential problems of causality. The classic example of a problem involving causality is the [...] "grandfather paradox": what if one were to go back in time and kill one's own grandfather before one's father was conceived? Some physicists, such as Novikov and Deutsch, suggested that these sorts of temporal paradoxes can be avoided through the Novikov self-consistency principle or to a variation of the many-worlds interpretation with interacting worlds.|$|R
50|$|The Algorismus demonstratus is a {{spurious}} attribution {{although for}} a long time this item was ascribed to Jordanus. Up until Eneström began to sort out the various treatises, the Algorismus demonstratus - since it was the only one published (ed. Johannes Schöner, Nuremberg, 1543) - was the heading under which all the treatises were grouped. Eneström thought it <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely,</b> however, <b>that</b> this version was the work of Jordanus since no manuscript ascribes it to him (if they give an author, it is generally a Magister Gernarus, or Gerhardus or Gernandus). The first part of this treatise (also known as the Algorismus de integris) contains definitions, axioms and 43 propositions. The second part (the Algorismus de minutiis) contains definitions and 42 propositions. Eneström shows that while different from the algorismi treatises of Jordanus, the Algorismus demonstratus is still closely related to them.|$|R
5|$|It is <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> this {{reaction}} {{will be able}} to create any atoms of ununennium in the near future, given the extremely difficult task of making sufficient amounts of einsteinium-254, which is favoured for production of ultraheavy elements because of its large mass, relatively long half-life of 270 days, and availability in significant amounts of several micrograms,Es|journal=Journal of the Less Common Metals|volume=122|pages=411–417|year=1986|doi=10.1016/0022-5088(86)90435-2|first10=R.

L.|displayauthors=9}} to make a large enough target to increase the sensitivity of the experiment to the required level; einsteinium has not been found in nature and has only been produced in laboratories, and in quantities smaller than those needed for effective synthesis of ultraheavy elements. However, given that ununennium is only the first period 8 element on the extended periodic table, it may well be discovered in the near future through other reactions, and indeed attempts to synthesise it in 2019 and 2020 are currently planned at laboratories at Japan and Russia. Currently, none of the period 8 elements have been discovered yet, and it is also possible, due to drip instabilities, that only the lower period 8 elements, up to around element 128, are physically possible. No attempts at synthesis have been made for any heavier alkali metals, such as unhexpentium, due to their extremely high atomic number: they would require new, more powerful technology to make.|$|E
25|$|During the Syrian Occupation of Lebanon (1976–2005), it was <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> Lebanon {{would sign}} {{a peace treaty}} with Israel before Syria, as Syria's {{influence}} on Lebanese politics was strong; however, the Syrian Occupation withdrew from Lebanon, yet the Iran–Syria–Hezbollah axis remained through the heavy arms presence.|$|E
25|$|This system placed {{twice as}} much {{emphasis}} on polls than computer rankings (since there were two polls and an average of six computer rankings) and made it <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> the top team in both polls would be denied {{a place in the}} title game, as it happened in the 2003–04 season.|$|E
50|$|The National Football League {{now has an}} {{elaborate}} formula for breaking ties in the qualification for its playoffs. One game playoffs are no longer possible - in the <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> event <b>that</b> two teams tied in all relevant statistical criteria, the rules stipulate that a coin toss settle the tie. However, before the merger of the National Football League and the American Football League in 1970, {{it was possible to}} have a playoff game if 2 teams tied for a division title. The NFL had 9 of these playoffs occur between 1941 and 1965. The AFL had 2 playoffs in 1963 and 1968. The All-America Football Conference, which merged with the NFL after the 1949 season (with the NFL absorbing three of the AAFC's franchises - the Cleveland Browns, San Francisco 49ers, and the original Baltimore Colts) also held a playoff tiebreaker game in 1948.|$|R
