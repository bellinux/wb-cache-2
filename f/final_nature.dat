25|$|The {{requirements}} of natural justice or {{a duty to}} act fairly depend on the context. In Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1999), the Supreme Court of Canada set out a list of non-exhaustive factors that would influence {{the content of the}} duty of fairness, including the nature of the decision being made and the process followed in making it, the statutory scheme under which the decision-maker operates, the importance of the decision to the person challenging it, the person's legitimate expectations, and the choice of procedure made by the decision-maker. Earlier, in Knight v. Indian Head School Division No. 19 (1990), the Supreme Court held that public authorities which make decisions of a legislative and general nature do not have a duty to act fairly, while those that carry out acts of a more administrative and specific nature do. Furthermore, preliminary decisions will generally not trigger the duty to act fairly, but decisions of a more <b>final</b> <b>nature</b> may have such an effect. In addition, whether a duty to act fairly applies depends on the relationship between the public authority and the individual. No duty exists where the relationship is one of master and servant, or where the individual holds office at the pleasure of the authority. On the other hand, a duty to act fairly exists where the individual cannot be removed from office except for cause. Finally, a right to procedural fairness only exists when an authority's decision is significant and has an important impact on the individual.|$|E

6000|$|The {{stages of}} Dante's {{intellectual}} and moral growth may, we think, {{be reckoned with}} some approach to exactness from data supplied by himself. In the poems of the Vita Nuova, Beatrice, until her death, was to him simply a poetical ideal, a type of abstract beauty, chosen according to the fashion of {{the day after the}} manner of the Provençal poets, but in a less carnal sense than theirs. [...] "And by the fourth nature of animals, that is, the sensitive, man has another love whereby he loves according to sensible appearance, even as a beast.... And by the fifth and <b>final</b> <b>nature,</b> that is, the truly human, or, to speak better, angelic, that is, rational, man has a love for truth and virtue.... Wherefore, since this nature is called mind, I said that love discoursed in my mind to make it understood that this love was that which is born in the noblest of natures, that is, [the love] of truth and virtue, and to shut out every false opinion by which it might be suspected that my love was for the delight of sense."[117] This is a very weighty affirmation, made, as it is, so deliberately by a man of Dante's veracity, who would and did speak truth at every hazard. Let us dismiss at once and forever all the idle tales of Dante's amours, of la Montanina, Gentucca, Pietra, Lisetta, and the rest, to that outer darkness of impure thoughts là onde la stoltezza dipartille.[118] We think Miss Rossetti a little hasty in allowing that in the years which immediately followed Beatrice's death Dante gave himself up [...] "more or less to sensual gratification and earthly aim." [...] The earthly aim we in a certain sense admit; the sensual gratification we reject as utterly inconsistent, not only with Dante's principles, but with his character and indefatigable industry. Miss Rossetti illustrates her position by a subtle remark on [...] "the lulling spell of an intellectual and sensitive delight in good running parallel with a voluntary and actual indulgence in evil." [...] The dead Beatrice beckoned him toward the life of contemplation, and it was precisely during this period that he attempted to find happiness in the life of action. [...] "Verily it is to be known, that we may in this life have two felicities, following two ways, good and best, which lead us thither. The one is the active, the other the contemplative life, the which (though by the active we may attain, as has been said, unto good felicity) leads us to the best felicity and blessedness."[119] [...] "The life of my heart, that is, of my inward self, was wont to be a sweet thought which went many times to the feet of God, that is to say, in thought I contemplated the kingdom of the Blessed. And I tell the final cause why I mounted thither in thought when I say, 'Where it [the sweet thought] beheld a lady in glory,' that I might make it understood that I was and am certain, by her gracious revelation, that she was in heaven, [not on earth, as I had vainly imagined,] whither I went in thought, so often as was possible to me, as it were rapt."[120] This passage exactly answers to another in Purgatorio, XXX. 115-138:-- ...|$|E

Findings from this sample indicate that SENCOs predict that schools in England will become more inclusive, with greater shared responsibility for achievement for all, and SENCOs' increased involvement in staff training and other whole school capacity-building activities.

The antigenic alterations which take place on the surface of normal cells when they are transformed may be qualitative, as exemplified by the gain of tumor-specific transplantation antigen(s) (TSTA) 1 or the complete loss of a normal antigen, or they may be quantitative, as in the modulation of normal histocompatibility antigens. The quantity of H- 2 isoantigen on the surface of different normal and tumor cells of the mouse has been shown to vary depending on the age of the animal (1 - 3), type of tissue or tumor (1, 4 [...] 6), and the immune state of the host (7 - 9). Recent serological studies (10, 11), the fluorescent antibody study of Cerottini and Brunner (12), and the immunoferritin study of Aoki et al.

40|$|A very {{fundamental}} and unconventional characteristic of superconductivity in iron-based materials {{is that it}} occurs {{in the vicinity of}} two other instabilities. Apart from a tendency towards magnetic order, these Fe-based systems have a propensity for nematic ordering: a lowering of the rotational symmetry while time-reversal invariance is preserved. Setting the stage for superconductivity, it is heavily debated whether the nematic symmetry breaking is driven by lattice, orbital or spin degrees of freedom. Here we report a very clear splitting of NMR resonance lines in FeSe at T_nem = 91 K, far above superconducting T_c of 9. 3 K. The splitting occurs for magnetic fields perpendicular to the Fe-planes and has the temperature dependence of a Landau-type order-parameter. Spin-lattice relaxation rates are not affected at T_nem, which unequivocally establishes orbital degrees of freedom as driving the nematic order. We demonstrate that superconductivity competes with the emerging nematicity.

The present study {{was an attempt to}} answer this question as well as to determine, if possible, the factors relating to success in the engineering field. The word success as used in this study was defined as the successful completion of an engineering curriculum at Oregon State College leading to a degree in that field. To obtain the information necessary questionnaires were distributed to freshman, sophomore and junior students in the School of Engineering at Oregon State College. The usable replies were divided into two major groups totaling 262 cases. The first group, the native group, consisted of those students who had enrolled as freshmen in the School of Engineering at Oregon State College and contained 132 cases broken down into the following engineering fields: electrical engineering, 54; mechanical engineering, 24; civil engineering, 47; and industrial engineering, 7. The second group, the transfer group, was made up of those students who had taken college work in another institution before transferring to the School of Engineering at Oregon State College. This group numbered 130 cases broken down into the following engineering fields: electrical engineering, 39; mechanical engineering, 30; civil engineering, 54; and industrial engineering, 7.

40|$|Controlling sensori-motor {{systems in}} higher animals or complex robots is a {{challenging}} combinatorial problem, because many sensory signals {{need to be}} simultaneously coordinated into a broad behavioural spectrum. To rapidly interact with the environment, this control needs to be fast and adaptive. Current robotic solutions operate with limited autonomy and are mostly restricted to few behavioural patterns. Here we introduce chaos control as a new strategy to generate complex behaviour of an autonomous robot. In the presented system, 18 sensors drive 18 motors via a simple neural control circuit, thereby generating 11 basic behavioural patterns (e. g., orienting, taxis, self-protection, various gaits) and their combinations. The control signal quickly and reversibly adapts to new situations and additionally enables learning and synaptic long-term storage of behaviourally useful motor responses. Thus, such neural control provides a powerful yet simple way to self-organize versatile behaviours in autonomous agents with many degrees of freedom.
