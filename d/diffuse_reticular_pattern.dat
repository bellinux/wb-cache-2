40|$|Background: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) usually {{presents}} with fever, pallor, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly {{and presence}} of lymphoblasts in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. ALL presenting as peripheral blood hypereosinophilia {{is a rare}} entity with less than 50 cases reported since 1973. It is a distinct clinico-pathologic entity with specific cytogenetic abnormalities. It is important for clinicians and the pathologists {{to be aware of}} the specific manifestation of ALL with eosinophilia. We report a case of ALL with peripheral blood eosinophilia. Case Presentation: A 39 year male presented with fever, cough with expectoration and dyspnoea. There was no past history of allergies, skin rash or parasitic infection. On examination there was hepatosplenomegaly with no lymphadenopathy. Chest X ray showed <b>diffuse</b> <b>reticular</b> <b>pattern</b> throughout the lungs. Peripheral smear examination revealed high leucocyte count (52, 900 /mm 3) with eosinophils constituting 89 % (AEC- 47740 /mm 3). No atypical cells or hemoparasites were seen. Stool examination for parasites and filarial serology were negative. Bone marrow examination, however, showed blasts constituting 90 %. Blasts were positive for TdT, CD 20, CD 10 by immunocytochemistry and a diagnosis of precursor B cell ALL was made. The patient was started on treatment. Cytogenetic analysis was also done...|$|E

40|$|Renal oncocytoma, {{conventional}} RCC (granular cell type) and chromophobe RCC {{have different}} prognosis. Sometimes differentiation {{between them is}} difficult in HandE slides. In a 5 -year study of 128 renal tumors, we selected 76 cases [30 conventional RCC (CRCC), 16 papillary RCC, 21 chromophobe RCC (ChRCC), 8 oncocytoma, 1 collecting duct carcinoma (cdc) ] and staining with Hale&#x 2032;s colloidal iron, CK 7, CK 8, CK 18, CK 19, CK 20, Vimentin, EMA, CD 10 and RCC marker were done. No significant difference was seen between renal tumor subtypes with CK 8, CK 18, CK 19, CK 20 and EMA. The most useful markers were Vimentin, CK 7, CD 10, RCC marker and Hale&#x 2032;s colloidal iron. Hale&#x 2032;s colloidal iron staining with <b>diffuse</b> <b>reticular</b> fine cytoplasmic <b>pattern</b> was present in ChRCCs, but was absent in other subtypes and oncocytomas.

40|$|Fibroblast {{growth factors}} (FGFs) have been {{demonstrated}} to regulate myogenic differentiation. Recently, forms of FGF have been generated that reside in the cytoplasm and appear to be biologically active. suggesting that an intracellular form of FGF {{may be able to}} transduce its signal through signaling pathways independent of its interaction with cell surface (transmembrane) FGF receptors (FGFR). We report in this study a potential mechanism by which such signaling can be modulated by an intracellular form of the receptor (I-FGFR). To generate this form of the receptor, the cDNA encoding the 2 IgG-like domain form of the murine transmembrane FGFR was mutated to remove its signal sequence and acidic box by PCR mutagenesis. This construct was then epitope-tagged to allow it to be distinguished from the endogenous surface FGF receptor. When the I-FGFR was transientlytransfected into COS cells, a <b>diffuse</b> and <b>reticular</b> <b>pattern</b> was observed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, indicating cytoplasmic localization with association to organized intracellular structures, such as cytoskeleton or organellar membrane. To test for the biologic effect of the I-FGFR, stable cell lines containing the I-FGFR were generated in Sol 8 cells. Quadruplicate samples of four cell lines expressing high levels of the I-FGFR, and four control cell lines transfected with vector alone, were grown in mitogen poor medium (5 % horse serum). Their ability to differentiate was assessed by their levels of creatine kinase activity normalized to total soluble protein (nmol NADPH/min/mg protein) :Days 01234 Control 53 ± 7155 ± 30236 ± 60759 ± 1431295 ± 205 I-FGFR 47 ± 12104 ± 32391 ± 30 * 1338 ± 312 * 2143 ± 677 **p < 0. 05 for I-FGFR versus controlThe results demonstrate that the intracellular form of the FGF receptor localizes to the cytoplasm of myocytes, and the increased expression of this receptor isoform triggers myogenic differentiation. We propose that this receptor promotes differentiation by binding endogenous FGF, and thus inhibiting the activity of FGF that normally preserves the undifferentiated state. The ability to generate and express the intracellular FGF receptor, therefore, may be a generally useful method of modulating FGF dependent regulation of proliferation and differentiation of other cell types such as smooth muscle and transformed cells...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction Dermoscopy is a {{non-invasive}} in vivo imaging technique, used in dermatology in feature identification, among pigmented melanocytic neoplasms, from suspicious skin lesions. Often, in {{the skin}} exam is possible to ascertain markers, whose identification and proper characterization is difficult, {{even when it is}} used a magnifying lens and a source of light. Dermoscopic images are thus a challenging source {{of a wide range of}} digital features, frequently with clinical correlation. Among these markers, one of particular interest to diagnosis in skin evaluation is the <b>reticular</b> <b>pattern.</b> Methods This paper presents a novel approach (avoiding pre-processing, e. g. segmentation and filtering) for <b>reticular</b> <b>pattern</b> detection in dermoscopic images, using texture spectral analysis. The proposed methodology involves a Curvelet Transform procedure to identify features. Results Feature extraction is applied to identify a set of discriminant characteristics in the <b>reticular</b> <b>pattern,</b> and it is also employed in the automatic classification task. The results obtained are encouraging, presenting Sensitivity and Specificity of 82. 35 % and 76. 79 %, respectively. Conclusions These results highlight the use of automatic classification, in the context of artificial intelligence, within a computer-aided diagnosis strategy, as a strong tool to help the human decision making task in clinical practice. Moreover, the results were obtained using images from three different sources, without previous lesion segmentation, achieving to a rapid, robust and low complexity methodology. These properties boost the presented approach to be easily used in clinical practice as an aid to the diagnostic process...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of lipid infiltration of gall-bladder (GB) wall {{in case of}} cholesterolosis are not known now. The aim of this work was studying the morphologic peculiarities of forming cholesterolosis comparing with state of chronic cholecystitis by anatomical parts of GB using system stereometric analysis. There was performed the histological examination of 2 groups of GB removed by standart laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to cholecystolithiasis. The first group contains GB with <b>diffuse</b> <b>reticular</b> form of cholesterolosis (n= 28), the second group contains GB with chronic inflammation without signs of activation (n= 21). Using G. G. Avtandilov’s recommendations there were determined the volume interrelations of stroma and epithelium (stromal-epithelial index), cellular content of lamina propria of GB mucosa (neutrophyles, eosinophyles, lymphocytes, plasmocytes, xantom cells), lymphocytes-plasmocytes index. The results were evaluated by t-criterion of Student, changes were statistically evident if р< 0, 05. There was also used the correlative analysis with estimation of correlation coefficient t. There was established that in case of GB cholesterlolsis the morphologic changes in GB wall had dystrophic character and might accompany with not marked sclerotic changes in mucosa. In case of chronic cholecystitis the inflammatory process lead to atrophic-sclerotic changes.

40|$|Aims: Antiphospholipid {{syndrome}} (APS) is {{a systemic}} autoimmune disorder characterized by vascular thrombosis. Pulmonary changes regarding interstitium and airways {{have not been}} described in APS. Our aim {{was to determine the}} prevalence of nonthrombotic pulmonary CT manifestations in patients with APS. Study Design: Prospective study. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Pneumonology, First Department of Internal Medicine, Department of Cardiology, Department of Radiology Medicine, between June 2009 and May 2011. Methodology: Ten patients who met criteria for APS (5 primary and 5 secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus) were prospectively identified. All patients underwent chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and functional assessment including spirometry and 6 -minute walking distance. Patients were free of respiratory symptoms. HRCT scans were evaluated for presence of air-trapping, subpleural <b>reticular</b> <b>pattern,</b> centrilobular nodules of ground-glass opacity, cysts, emphysema, atelectasis, consolidation and pleural effusion. Extent of air-trapping was estimated based on a HRCT scoring system. Results: All patients exhibited radiological and functional pattern compatible with smallairway disease, irrespective of smoking status. HRCT findings were negatively correlated with reduced levels of maximum midexepiratory flow (MMEF) 25 / 75 %pred (r=- 0. 936, p< 0. 0001). Subpleural basal <b>reticular</b> <b>pattern</b> consistent with fibrosis was seen in 3 patients. Thin-walled cysts and upper-lobe hazy micronodular pattern were detected in 4 patients.

40|$|PURPOSE: To analyze choroidal changes {{associated}} with reticular pseudodrusen by indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) and enhanced depth imaging spectral-domain {{optical coherence tomography}} (EDI SD-OCT). METHODS: Twenty-two consecutive patients (22 eyes) with reticular pseudodrusen, and without medium/large drusen, underwent ICGA and EDI OCT. Twenty-one age- and sex-matched subjects (21 eyes) with early age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and without pseudodrusen, also underwent EDI OCT. RESULTS: Mean age of patients with reticular pseudodrusen and with early AMD was 82. 5 ± 0. 9 and 79. 3 ± 4. 4 years of age, respectively (P = 0. 9), and 59. 0 % and 76. 2 % were females, respectively (P = 0. 7). On ICGA, <b>reticular</b> <b>patterns</b> appeared as hypofluorescent, not overlying the large choroidal vessels. Areas of iso/hyperfluorescence on ICGA, occurring adjacently to <b>reticular</b> <b>patterns,</b> appeared on OCT as subretinal deposits. The mean subfoveal choroidal thickness was significantly reduced in the group with reticular pseudodrusen compared with that {{in the control group}} (174. 6 ± 10. 1 and + 241. 4 ± 16. 5, respectively; P < 0. 001). At all measurement points, but the 3000 μm superior to the fovea, the choroidal thickness of eyes with reticular pseudodrusen appeared thinner than that of the control group. Interestingly, the choroid of eyes with reticular pseudodrusen appeared thicker at 3000 μm superior to the fovea compared with that at all other measurement points. CONCLUSIONS: It was shown that the <b>reticular</b> <b>patterns</b> appeared as hypofluorescent lesions on ICGA, closely abutting, but not overlying the large choroidal vessels.
