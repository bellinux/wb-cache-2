25|$|I {{bought my}} first copy in 1968 – a small, fat bundle of Pelican {{with a picture}} of a Yorkshire miner on the front – and I still have it, bandaged up and {{exhausted}} by the years of labour. From the first of its 900-odd pages, <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>and</b> my friends at the University of Sussex knew, that this was something else. We talked about it in the bar and on the bus and in the refectory queue. Imagine that: young male students more interested in a book than in gooseberry tart and custard.|$|E
500|$|Strindberg had the {{reputation}} of a misogynist, something which all of his wives stoutly denied. Bosse wrote in an unpublished statement which she left to her daughter with Strindberg, Anne-Marie: [...] "During the years <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>and</b> was married to Strindberg I saw only a completely natural, kind, honorable, faithful man—a 'gentleman'". However, all of Strindberg's marriages were blighted by his jealousy and a sensitivity which has sometimes been considered paranoid and delusional.|$|E

500|$|Oppong's {{performances}} {{helped him}} get an NCAA scholarship into Eastern Kentucky. Idaho, Utah State, Colorado State, and Murray State were some of his other potential Division I destinations. He {{was considered one of}} the top Canadians committing to an NCAA program that year, in a list headlined by Andrew Nicholson and Kris Joseph. As soon as he arrived at EKU, he became close with the school. Oppong said, [...] "From the first day, I was accepted, as soon as I stepped on campus. I was here in the summertime and there were a few guys here who <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>and</b> as soon as we came in August, I felt like I was part of the family." [...] Head coach Jeff Neubauer commented on him, [...] "We think Papa Oppong will be a tough match-up for our opponents because he is a shooter, rebounder and slasher." ...|$|E
500|$|Leroux {{stated that}} {{at a very early}} age, she knew she wanted to play for the United States women's {{national}} soccer team. To pursue her goal, she moved to Scottsdale, Arizona at the age of 15 and attended Horizon High School during her junior and senior years while living with multiple host families. Despite having a challenging time adjusting to life without her family and friends, she helped lead Sereno Soccer Club to state titles in 2007 and 2008. Of her move to the United States, she said, [...] "It was not easy. It {{was probably one of the}} most difficult things I ever had to do, move away from everything that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>and</b> was comfortable with to something that I had no idea about. Not having any family around. Doing it on my own. As a 15-year-old, that's kind of hard. I had to grow up really fast [...] But I guess it's all worth it. Now I have a chance to prove myself, and that's what I enjoy, and that's why I did what I did." ...|$|E
2500|$|New Catholic episcopates, {{which ran}} {{parallel}} to the established Anglican episcopates, and a Catholic conversion drive awakened fears of 'papal aggression' and relations between the Catholic Church and the establishment remained frosty. At {{the end of the}} nineteenth century one contemporary wrote that [...] "the prevailing opinion of the religious people <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>and</b> loved was that Roman Catholic worship is idolatry, and that it was better to be an Atheist than a Papist". When former Prime Minister Gladstone wrote a polemic against the infallibility declaration of the Catholic Church, it sold 150,000 copies in 1874. He urged Catholics to obey the crown and disobey the pope when there was disagreement.|$|E

2500|$|By 2006, Dobson {{returned}} to the studio to finish her second album, Sunday Love. [...] Musicians and songwriters she collaborated with during the recording process include Holly Knight, Nina Gordon, Kay Hanley, John 5, Billy Steinberg, Matthew Wilder, Cyndi Lauper, Courtney Love, Joan Jett, and Rancid's Tim Armstrong. Sunday Love was not released at the time, due to Dobson being terminated by Island Records {{just days before the}} album was scheduled for release. The album was reviewed favorably in both Spin and Vibe magazine. [...] "My real good fans, my hardcore fans, have it, so that's most important," [...] Dobson says. [...] "At least it got out there to a few hands, and now it's time to make a record on my own terms." [...] "It was sad," [...] says Dobson. [...] "But instead of sitting there and being depressed and begging people for the record, I went back to the studio, got people that I knew, friends that <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>and</b> I started again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Commenting on Wellington's record, Newby-Fraser said, [...] "But {{the revelation}} I had was {{watching}} how hard {{she worked for}} it ... {{and it was clear}} she was going to the well. And I am certain she had to leave a little bit of herself out there to get it done. She didn't take a moment to enjoy until she crossed the line. Part of me was gratified by that. I know what she had to do to get it and I hope she realizes it's not that easy. I know it wasn't that easy for her. A race like that takes a piece of herself out there." [...] A year later her coach Dave Scott revealed that she had an upper hamstring injury and that, [...] "Deep down inside, she had a bit of a struggle in 2009." [...] Even though she had broken the long-standing course record, Scott said, [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>and</b> she knew, and I told her in my ever-candid, callous style, that she didn't have her best day." ...|$|E
2500|$|Barry {{attended}} LeMoyne–Owen College, in Memphis, {{graduating in}} 1958. In his junior year, the racial injustices {{he had seen}} started to come together. He and his friends went to a segregated fairground in Memphis, and went at a time reserved for whites, {{because they wanted to}} see the science exhibit. When they were close to the exhibit, a policeman stopped them and asked them to leave. Barry and his friends left without protest. At that time, Barry did not know much about his race, or why they were treated poorly, but he resented the incident. Barry became more active in the NAACP chapter at LeMoyne-Owens, serving as president. It is sometimes said that his ardent support of the Civil Rights Movement earned him the nickname [...] "Shep", in reference to Soviet politician Dmitri Shepilov, and then Barry began using Shepilov as his middle name. But Barry stated in his autobiography that he chose the name with regard to his middle initial S, which had initially stood for nothing, after having found Shepilov's name in newspapers: [...] "I had picked out “Shepilov” as a middle name {{because it was the only}} one that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>and</b> liked".|$|E

2500|$|Ligeti's {{earliest}} {{works are}} often {{an extension of}} the musical language of Béla Bartók. Even his piano cycle Musica ricercata (1953), though written according to Ligeti with a [...] "Cartesian" [...] approach in which he [...] "regarded all the music <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>and</b> loved as being... irrelevant", has been described by one biographer as inhabiting a world very close to Bartók's set of piano works, Mikrokosmos. Ligeti's set comprises eleven pieces in all. The work is based on a simple restriction: the first piece uses exclusively one pitch A, heard in multiple octaves, and only {{at the very end of}} the piece is a second note, D, heard. The second piece then uses three notes (E, F, and G), the third piece uses four, and so on, so that in the final piece all twelve notes of the chromatic scale are present. Shortly after its composition Ligeti arranged six of the movements of Musica ricercata for wind quintet under the title 'Six Bagatelles for Wind Quintet'. The Bagatelles were performed first in 1956, but not in their entirety: the last movement was censored by the Soviets for being too 'dangerous'.|$|E
2500|$|Ellen Burstyn {{was still}} in the midst of filming The Exorcist when Warner Bros. {{executives}} expressed interest in working with her on another project. Burstyn later recalled, [...] "It was early in the woman's movement, and we were all just waking up and having a look at the pattern of our lives and wanting it to be different… I wanted to make a different kind of film. A film from a woman's point of view, but a woman that I recognized, that <b>I</b> <b>knew.</b> <b>And</b> not just myself, but my friends, what we were all going through at the time. So my agent found Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore… When I read it I liked it a lot. I sent it to Warner Brothers and they agreed to do it. Then they asked who I wanted to direct it. I said that I didn't know, but I wanted somebody new and young and exciting. I called Francis Coppola and asked who was young and exciting and he said 'Go look at a movie called Mean Streets and see what you think.' It hadn't been released yet, so I booked a screening to look at it and I felt that it was exactly what…Alice needed, because [...] was a wonderful script and well written, but for my taste it was a little slick. You know – in a good way, in a kind of Doris Day–Rock Hudson kind of way. I wanted something a bit more gritty." ...|$|E
2500|$|Raekwon {{released}} Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... as {{his first}} solo album, and the third seen from the Wu {{after the release of}} their debut album Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), with Method Man's Tical and Ol' Dirty Bastard's [...] released prior. The song [...] "Can It Be All So Simple," [...] from 36 Chambers, marked the first recorded exhibition of Raekwon and Ghostface Killah as a duo, as the two would further establish this alliance on Only Built 4 Cuban Linx.... Much of the content on the album deals with real life topics and situations that both Raekwon and Ghostface Killah commonly encountered and experienced while growing up in Staten Island, New York. In an interview with Wax Poetics, Raekwon explained [...] "I grew up in the street, so I talked about the shit <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>and</b> saw. We did the hustlin' thing, we did the crime thing; we did all the things that made us feel like mobsters or Mafiosos in some way." [...] In a different article, Ghostface Killah recollected [...] "Back then I was punchin' a lot of rap niggas in their face, and niggas was getting beat up in the clubs. We were banned from everything. They wouldn't even let me in the Tunnel. Niggas was scared to death when I was out there wilding. I was fucking niggas up, robbing niggas, fucking a lot of bitches, just doing dumb shit." ...|$|E
