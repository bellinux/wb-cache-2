5|$|Dayton Project {{employees}} {{were not allowed}} to eat or smoke in processing areas, and had to scrub their hands before leaving these areas. They also had to shower {{at the end of each}} day's work, and were subjected to weekly urine tests. Employees with elevated levels of polonium were not allowed in the processing areas. Working with polonium without spreading contamination proved to be almost impossible. Fortunately, it was not a bone-seeker like radium or plutonium, and was readily excreted in urine. Detection methods had already been developed, making it easy to track. The employee at Unit IV with the highest levels of polonium in her urine had contaminated her hair, and often held bobby pins <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
5|$|The young may all hatch in {{a single}} night. Crocodilians are unusual among {{reptiles}} {{in the amount of}} parental care provided after the young hatch. The mother helps excavate hatchlings from the nest and carries them to water <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> Newly hatched crocodilians gather together and stay close to their mother. For spectacled caimans in the Venezuelan llanos, individual mothers are known to leave their young in the same nurseries, or crèches, and one of the mothers guards them. Hatchlings of many species tend to bask in a group during the day and disperse at nightfall to feed. The time it takes young crocodilians to reach independence can vary. For American alligators, groups of young associate with adults for one to two years, while juvenile saltwater and Nile crocodiles become independent in a few months.|$|E

5|$|To {{prove his}} innocence, Deodato had Luca Barbareschi get {{in contact with}} the other three actors, and the four of them were interviewed for an Italian {{television}} show. Deodato also explained in court how the special effect in the impalement scene was achieved: a bicycle seat was attached to the end of an iron pole, upon which the actress sat. She then held a short length of balsa wood <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and looked skyward, thus giving the appearance of impalement. Deodato also provided the court with pictures of the girl interacting with the crew after the scene had been filmed. After they were presented with this evidence, the courts dropped all murder charges against Deodato.|$|E
5|$|Confronting Joyce {{about the}} story, Lois {{questions}} her intentions, with Joyce revealing {{that the two}} attended high school together, where she was known as Joyce Chevapravatdumrong. She also reveals that Lois humiliated {{her in front of}} the entire school, by placing a hotdog <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and pulling down her pants while blindfolded (revealing her pink underwear), and has sought revenge ever since. At church the next day, Lois and her family enter, and are immediately demanded to leave by the preacher. Becoming extremely depressed, Lois is eventually coaxed by Brian to face her mistake by showing it to the church. The porno causes the church to reaccept her and admit the Griffin family back into their congregation due to a positive opinion of the film, much to Joyce's anger. Stewie in the meantime develops suspicions of having been conceived through the creation of the porno, heightened when he sees that one of the actors has a football-shaped head like his.|$|E
25|$|Mouth brooders - carry eggs or larvae {{in their}} mouth. Mouth brooders can be ovophiles or larvophiles. Ovophile or egg-loving mouth-brooders {{lay their eggs}} in a pit, which are sucked up {{into the mouth of}} the female. The small number of large eggs hatch in the mother's mouth, and the fry remain there for a period of time. Fertilization often occurs with the help of egg-spots, which are {{colorful}} spots on the anal fin of the male. When the female sees these spots, she tries to pick up the egg-spots, but instead gets a mouthful of sperm, fertilizing the eggs <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> Many cichlids and some labyrinth fish are ovophile mouthbrooders. Larvophile or larvae-loving mouth-brooders lay their eggs on a substrate and guard them until the eggs hatch. After hatching, the female picks up the fry and keeps them <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> When the fry can fend for themselves, they are released. Some eartheaters are larvophile mouthbrooders.|$|E

25|$|Egg-laying {{is done by}} {{bringing}} the abdomen close to the mouthparts where the pap is being held. The female holds her front legs up and open and appears {{to use them to}} touch her abdomen. Her antennae are completely still and her wings are closed during the operation. Then her abdomen begins to vibrate, and her sting is turned inside and out and folded backwards. During this process, the egg is expelled and placed directly on the pap that the female is holding <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> She does not touch it with her legs at all. Then her abdomen relaxes and the female places the egg inside the cell. The average length of the eggs laid by L. vechti is 1.36mm, and ovarian eggs are considered ready to be laid once they reach 1.16mm.|$|E

60|$|Euchre {{came up on}} {{the porch}} and awkwardly {{introduced}} Duane to Mrs. Bland. She was young, probably not over twenty-five, and not quite so prepossessing at close range.

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} behaviors of species of Parischnogaster is the egg deposition process. The ovipositing female uses an abdominal substance produced by herself to handle the egg. In the first stage, the wasp collects a patch of viscid abdominal substance <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> The patch is then placed into the cell. In the second stage, the wasp bends her abdomen towards her mouth. As the egg emerges from the abdomen the female will grasp it with its mouthparts. The final stage consists of collecting another patch of abdominal substance to place on top of the egg in the cell. This process may have evolved for defense purposes. Since P. alternata typically take on flight as an active defense, this method helps the female save the egg they are laying if disturbed by an attack.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of hatching, the young start calling within the eggs. They have an egg-tooth {{at the tip of}} their snouts, which is {{developed}} from the skin, and that helps them pierce out of the shell. Hearing the calls, the female usually excavates the nest and sometimes takes the unhatched eggs <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> slowly rolling the eggs to help the process. The young is usually carried to the water in the mouth. She would then introduce her hatchlings to the water and even feed them. The mother would then take care of her young for over a year before the next mating season. In the absence of the mother crocodile, the father would act in her place {{to take care of the}} young. However, even with a sophisticated parental nurturing, young crocodiles have a very high mortality rate due to their vulnerability to predation. A group of hatchlings is called a pod or crèche and may be protected for months.|$|E
25|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the Kearney attack, there were half a dozen similar attacks (See table), though none of the purported victims were able to provide a clear description of the prowler, and no clues were found {{at the scene of}} the attacks. The first specimen of physical evidence was found on the night of September 5, when Carl and Beulah Cordes of North 21st Street returned home around 10:00 pm. After spending a few minutes in the house they noticed a piece of white cloth, slightly larger than a man's handkerchief, sitting on their porch next to the screen door. Beulah Cordes picked up the cloth and smelled it. As soon as she inhaled, she became violently ill. She described the effect as being similar to an electric shock. Her face quickly began to swell, she experienced a burning sensation <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and throat, and began to vomit. As with other victims, she also reported feeling weak and experiencing partial paralysis of her legs. Beulah Cordes later hypothesized that the cloth had been left on the porch in order to knock out the family dog, which usually slept there, so that the prowler could gain access to the house unnoticed.|$|E
