The goal of the work was to evaluate {{the effect of the}} type and reactivity of functional groups in the POSS cage on properties of the resulting elastomeric nanocomposites. The paper presents some of the preliminary results obtained from the studies. The results indicate that incorporation of POSS into silica-filled HNBR elastomer network increases interfacial interactions of the systems and the POSS molecules can be successfully used as coagents of crosslinking towards the elastomer matrix and efficient additives improving the mechanical properties of elastomeric nanocomposites. Furthermore, evaluation of changes in mechanical properties, induced in a result of POSS/HNBR composites ageing, show that the inclusion of POSS in the HNBR network is directly influencing the stabilizing effect and improves the ageing resistance of elastomer composites...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The aim of {{the work}} was to study the effect of organo-montmorillonite (OMt) on the {{properties}} of <b>hydrogenated</b> nitrile <b>rubber</b> (HNBR) /OMt nanocomposites. The nanocomposites were prepared by a melt intercalation method. The structure of the composites was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The behavior of stress-strain, aging resistance, solvent resistance, and the dynamic mechanical properties of HNBR/OMt nanocomposites were investigated. The TEM and XRD {{results showed that the}} OMt layers were dispersed homogeneously in the HNBR matrix. The HNBR/OMt nanocomposites showed excellent mechanical properties which were attributed to the nanometer scale dispersion and strong interaction between the HNBR and OMt. The composites possessed excellent aging resistance and oil resistance, which improved with OMt content. Dynamic mechanical analysis showed that the glass-transition temperature, Tg, of the HNBR/OMt nanocomposites was increased and the nanocomposites had a good rolling resistance in comparison to pure HNBR.

We can find complexity arising from some causes of leakage {{even in a}} simple square-ring rubber seal. The major causes are (1) large displacement around a head-gasket generated by the combustion, (2) seal distortion at a high compression, (3) seal rubber degradation induced by coolant microorganism deterioration, (4) uncontrolled seal production and (5) unsuitable rubber composition. Through our DAR, we can resolve {{the complexity of the}} leakage and can clarify all the cause positions and their relationships. We can confirm that an improved silicone rubber seal, which has a higher fatigue strength, an excellent acid-resistance and a uniform contact property, is the correct resolution.

Recommended belt life varies between designs; belts made from neoprene for older vehicles might have a recommended life of around 20000 mi while newer designs with lower torque loading and made from <b>hydrogenated</b> nitrile butadiene <b>rubber</b> (HNBR) may have a recommended life of 60000 mi or more. By 2004, the range for timing belt life for new engine designs was 60000 - 100000 mi, with some designs having no fixed replacement schedule but with continued use based on visual inspection. Torque loading, vibration, oil, heat and dirt reduce belt life. Timing belts are regularly replaced during engine overhauls.|$|R

40|$|A {{peroxide}} curable <b>hydrogenated</b> nitrile <b>rubber</b> (HNBR) {{was modified}} by cyclic butylene terephthalate oligomer (CBT), added in 100 parts per hundred rubber (phr). CBT polymerization {{was expected to}} occur simultaneously {{with that of the}} curing of the HNBR rubber (T = 190 °C, t = 25 min). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicated that only a minor part of CBT has been polymerized (pCBT) in the hybrid. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) revealed that HNBR formed the continuous whereas (p) CBT the dispersed phase. Mechanical properties (hardness, tensile modulus, ultimate tensile strength and strain, tear strength) of the HNBR and HNBR/CBT were determined and collated. Tribological properties were investigated with pin(steel) -onplate(rubber) (POP), with roller(steel) -on-plate (rubber) (ROP), with oscillating steel cylinder on rubber plate (Fretting) test configurations. Coefficient of friction (COF) and specific wear rate of the HNBR-based systems were determined. It was found that the resistance to wear increases with CBT hybridization. On the other hand, COF did not change much with CBT content. The friction and wear characteristics strongly depended on the test configurations. The worn surface of the HNBR systems was inspected in scanning electron microscope (SEM) to conclude the typical wear mechanisms. SEM investigation showed that the CBT was predominantly recrystallized from its molten state under the curing conditions set.

The elastomeric matrices were natural (NR), ethylene propylene diene (EPDM) and <b>hydrogenated</b> nitrile <b>rubbers</b> (HNBR). Moreover, the strain softening (Payne effect) of selected rubbers with 30 part per hundred rubber (phr) filler content was also investigated by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) in shear mode. DMTA results indicated that the Payne effect follows the ranking: MWCNT(fibrous) &# 62; organoclay(platy) &# 62; silica(spherical). J-resistance (JR) curves were constructed by plotting the J value {{as a function of the}} crack tip opening displacement (CTOD*), monitored during loading. CTOD* = 0. 1 mm was considered as crack initiation threshold and thus assigned to the critical value JIc. JIc increased with increasing filler loading, whereby MWCNT outperformed both silica and CB. On the other hand, JIc did not change with filler loading for the NR/organoclay systems that was traced to straininduced crystallization effect in NR. The tearing modulus (TJ) also increased with increasing filler loading. The related increase strongly depended on both rubber and filler types.

A columnar growth and a tile-like microstructure of the DLC films were identified by scanning electron microscopy. Patch sizes can be correlated with the deposition conditions. The coefficient of friction (CoF) of DLC film coated HNBR {{was found to be}} much lower than that of the unprotected rubber, and more reduced for the DLC films with smaller patch sizes, which is explained by a better flexibility and conformity of the film during testing. In one of the samples, unexpected low CoF was observed, which was attributed to a modification of the mechanical properties of the rubber during the plasma treatment at high voltage.

40|$|Elastomer seals {{are widely}} used in the {{petroleum}} industry. Seal failure can be very expensive, due to losses in production and high maintenance costs. Another aspect of this problem is the difficulty in predicting the working life, of a specific elastomeric seal in a specific application, at the design stage. The objective of the present work is to develop the theoretical and computational seal life model to assist reliable prediction of seal life. Seal life computer software has been developed to model fluid ingress into elastomeric seals and the resulting long term material property changes caused by volume swell and chemical reaction between elastomer and ingressed fluid. The approach used is to model diffusion using a finite element method. This permits application {{to a wide range}} of seal geometries. The mathematical model of diffusion is coupled with chemical reaction equations of second order to model chemical ageing processes in the seal. To model the effects of swell, volume of absorbed fluid is coupled with Young's modulus. Physical, as opposed to chemical, stress relaxation is not incorporated since the short time scale of this enable direct measurements to be made. The software has been tested against experimental data for a number of elastomer / operating condition combinations. Satisfactory agreement is obtained for ethylene propylene diene (EPDM) and nitrile rubber aged in air or high pressure water; nitrile and <b>hydrogenated</b> nitrile <b>rubber</b> (HNBR) aged in high temperature, high pressure hydrocarbon liquid.

HNBR systems {{were found to be}} semi-crystalline, with their crystallinity to increase with the addition of MWCNTs. In their dielectric spectra, four relaxation processes were detected. Ascending in relaxation time, these were attributed to: (i) interfacial polarization at the interface of crystalline and amorphous regions of HNBR and at the interface between HNBR and MWCNTs, (ii) glass to rubber transition of the amorphous part of HNBR, (iii) rearrangement of polar side groups, such as –CN, and (iv) local motions of small segments of the main elastomer chain. Electrical conductivity increases with MWCNT content and frequency increasing. The effect of temperature, on the electrical response, is more pronounced at low frequencies. The temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity strongly deviates from a pure Arrhenius behavior, signifying that the occurring conductance mechanisms do not correspond to a single thermally activated process. Relaxation dynamics imply that crystalline regions exert motion restrictions to large segments of the macromolecules in the amorphous phase and to polar parts of the systems...|$|R

The tribological behavior of uncoated and coated rubbers has been investigated with ball-on-disc tribotest under dry sliding condition against a 100 Cr 6 ball. The coefficient of friction (CoF) of uncoated rubbers is very high (> 1). Equally a relatively high CoF of W-DLC coated FKM (about 0. 6) is observed due to the gradual failure and delamination of the coatings. On the contrary, W-DLC coated HNBR rubber exhibits a superior tribological performance with a very low CoF of 0. 2 - 0. 25.

However, HNBR and HNBR-rich blends were observed to strain harden at a rate higher than that of NBR. Induced crystallization of HNBR was suggested to be the reason for the strain hardening. The different rheological, thermal, and mechanical testing tech-niques agree in suggesting that the structurally similar HNBR and NBR are not ther-modynamically miscible but mechanically compatible...|$|R
40|$|Tungsten-containing diamondlike carbon (W-DLC) {{coatings}} {{have been}} deposited on FKM (fluorocarbon), ACM (acrylate), and HNBR (<b>hydrogenated</b> nitrile butadiene) <b>rubbers</b> via unbalanced magnetron reactive sputtering from a WC target in C 2 H 2 /Ar plasma. The surface morphology and fracture cross sections of coated rubbers have been scrutinized by high resolution {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM). The random crack networks formed due to the large difference in the coefficients of thermal expansion break down the W-DLC coatings into segments {{of a couple of}} hundred micrometers in size, facilitating good flexibility if the interfacial adhesion between the coating and a rubber substrate is strong enough. The size and density of growth defects in the W-DLC coatings strongly depend on the surface roughness of the rubber sheets. The tribological behavior of uncoated and coated rubbers has been investigated with ball-on-disk tribotest under dry sliding condition against a 6 mm 100 Cr 6 ball. Uncoated rubbers exhibited a very high coefficient of friction (> 0. 9). W-DLC coated FKM did not considerably reduce the friction because the coating was damaged due to poor adhesion. W-DLC coated HNBR and ACM exhibited excellent tribological performance, and very low coefficients of friction (< 0. 24) were achieved even at high normal load of 5 N. After tribotests, the W-DLC coatings on HNBR and ACM were intact and no serious damage was observed on the wear tracks. ...|$|R
40|$|In this study, Ti-containing {{diamond-like}} carbon (Ti-DLC) coatings have been deposited on HNBR (<b>hydrogenated</b> nitrile butadiene) <b>rubber</b> {{and also on}} Si wafer as reference via unbalanced magnetroli reactive sputtering from a Ti target in C 2 H 2 /Ar plasma. The deposition rates of coatings on rubber and Si wafer were about the same. Columnar structures resulting from a rough interface were often observed in the coatings deposited on rubbers. Only at a high bias voltage of - 300 V the coating on HNBR rubber became column-free whereas a bias voltage of - 100 V could already restrain the columnar structure and thus produced dense and smooth coatings on Si wafer. A segmented morphology of the coatings on HNBR rubber {{is formed as a}} result of the large difference in thermal expansion between the coating and HNBR rubber. The crack network that separates the patches plays an important role in maintaining the coating flexibility. The size of the patches reduces with increasing bias voltage and thus the variation of deposition temperature. A high bias voltage enhances the hardness of Ti-coating and the rubber-coating adhesion, and guarantees a good tribological performance. When sliding against o 6 mm 100 Cr 6 steel ball counterpart, very low coefficients of friction were achieved (1. 3 for the uncoated). The Ti-DLC coating can be considered as a promising material for the enhancement of tribological performance of rubbers. (c) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
30|$|Recently, {{efforts have}} been taken to study the sealing {{properties}} of packer rubber through theoretical calculation, numerical simulation and experimental methods. The materials and the structure are the important factors that affect the sealing properties of the packer rubber. Zhu et al. (2017) made comparisons on the mechanical performances and morphology of three kinds of rubber materials (NBR, HNBR and FKM) before and after corrosion experiments, and the results showed that the tensile properties decreased significantly and the hardness also reduced after corrosion. He et al. (2016) investigated <b>hydrogenated</b> nitrile–butadiene <b>rubber</b> (HNBR) with a Rubber Processing Analyzer RPA- 2000 and conducted stress–strain tests in both elongation and compression modes. In order to reflect the applications of packers, all the mechanical properties were tested at both room temperature (RT) and 150  °C. Zeng et al. (2012) carried out tests on AFLAS rubber (a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and propylene) using a HPHT autoclave in harsh environments (60  MPa, 175  °C, test period 7  days and different corrosive gases) and analyzed the changes in properties. Atkinson et al. (2001) and Guo et al. (2011) analyzed the touch stress and pressure in the inner wall of the rubber part with nonlinear finite element analysis and optimized the rubber wall thickness through some advantaged plans to bear much stronger stress. Ma et al. (2014) and Qu (2016) constructed a finite element simulation model of double elastomeric packing elements in a packer using ANSYS software and analyzed the influences of different friction coefficients, the loading model and the different angles of the tilted end of the packing element on the varying patterns of contact stress between the packing element and the casing pipe. Polonsky and Tyurin (2015) came up with a new structure design for packers after discussing several designs aiming at enhancing sealing reliability and considering the packers’ working conditions. In order to solve the technical problems of deep wells and complex formations, James et al. (2013) improved the temperature resistance and the pressure resistance of the permanent production packer from 69  MPa and 121  °C to 138  MPa and 132  °C after many years of studies. Zhang et al. (2011) and Wang et al. (2014) experimentally investigated the working force between the packer rubber and the casing tube and the stress–strain curves of packer rubber material at different temperatures, which provide the basis for establishing constitutive relations of packer rubbers.|$|R
40|$|The {{friction}} and wear characteristics of several elastomers {{have been studied}} during reciprocating sliding conditions when lubricated with uncontaminated environmentally adapted lubricants and the same lubricants contaminated with moisture. The elastomers studied are Nitrile Butadiene <b>Rubber</b> (NBR), <b>Hydrogenated</b> Nitrile Butadiene <b>Rubber</b> (HNBR), and Fluorocarbon Rubber (FKM). The lubricants used are complex ester and polyol ester as well as both aged and non-aged polyol esters with 5 % water content. Experiments were conducted using a Cameron-Plint test rig with a steel cylinder sliding in the longitudinal direction with a reciprocating motion against a curved elastomer specimen to avoid any edge contact. Sliding velocities were maintained low to reduce the thermal effects often associated with elastomer friction. In these tests, HNBR resulted in the lowest friction, with NBR the highest. The NBR specimens most often experienced wear, while FKM and HNBR experienced very little wear. The various oils, with some exceptions, had similar friction performance both at the higher and the lower loads. Experiments were also conducted using an SRV Optimol test rig at higher frequencies with a steel cylinder in contact with an elastomer mounted on a steel disc. The results from the SRV test rig differed significantly {{with those of the}} Cameron-Plint rig with FKM resulting the greatest wear and NBR producing minimal wear. This difference was primarily caused by the differences in contact geometry and the operating parameters between the tests.

40|$|The {{friction}} and wear characteristics of several elastomers are investigated under sliding contact lubricated by environmentally adapted lubricants {{with varying degrees}} of contamination. The elastomers studied are flat strips of Nitrile Butadiene <b>rubber</b> (NBR), <b>Hydrogenated</b> Nitrile Butadiene <b>Rubber</b> (HNBR), and Fluorocarbon Rubber (FKM) and O-Rings of both molded and extruded NBR and FKM. The lubricants used are uncontaminated Complex Ester and Polyolester as well as both Aged and Un-Aged Polyolesters with 5 % Water Content as well as a commercial synthetic based turbine oil and a commercial mineral oil based turbine oil. Initial experiments were conducted using a Cameron-Plint test rig with a steel cylinder sliding in the longitudinal direction with a reciprocating motion against a curved elastomer specimen to avoid any edge contact. Sliding velocities were maintained low to reduce the thermal effects often associated with elastomer friction. The results from these experiments demonstrate the compatibility of the different elastomers with the various lubricants and load configurations. Further testing was conducted using the Cameron-Plint machine with O-ring material sliding against flat steel plates results of which validated the use of synthetic ester in lieu of mineral base oils in the case of sealing surfaces of proper roughness and found that extruded NBR performed best of the tested materials. Experiments were also conducted using an SRV Optimol test rig at higher frequencies with a steel cylinder in contact with an elastomer disc. The results from the SRV test rig conflicted significantly with those of the Cameron-Plint rig due to the differences in contact geometry of the tests. Other experiments conducted using an Abrasive Test machine which reciprocated a steel ring against elastomer specimens produced no worthwhile results other than demonstrating the durability of the elastomer specimens when operating in the elasto- hydrodynamic lubrication regime.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of vulcanizates based on <b>Hydrogenated</b> Nitrile Butadiene <b>Rubber</b> (HNBR) are extremely attractive for many applications {{in comparison with}} other elastomers. In fact such type of materials exhibits good stability towards thermal ageing and better properties at low temperatures compared with other heat and oil resistant elastomers. This combination of properties is opening up {{a broad range of}} applications, mainly in the automotive industry like belts, seals and hoses. With reference to the in-service life of such components, it clearly appears that the obtainement of good fracture properties of HNBR-based systems is of basic importance. The present work is aimed at investigating the fracture behaviour of vulcanized HNBR systems containing different nanofillers, such as silica and multi wall carbon nanotubes (1). The fracture behavior of the different nanocomposites is studied by a fracture mechanics approach based on J-integral methodology to evaluate the material resistance to crack initiation (JIC) and propagation (J-resistance curve) (2). The fracture tests are carried out using SEN(T) specimens. During each test the deformation and fracture processes are recorded by a camera at different short time intervals, allowing the evaluation of the crack tip opening displacement at different extents of crack propagation. The evaluation of the corresponding J-values, determined by proper integration of load-displacement curve, allows the construction of J(CTOD) resistance curve (2). For the systems investigated the results obtained, with varying the type and content of nanofiller, are analysed and discussed. The results point out that multiwall carbon nanotubes are markedly more efficient than silica in promoting fracture resistance with particular reference to fracture initiation. Further, the comparison of the results with those obtained for other filled elastomeric systems confirms the very high toughening efficiency of carbon nanotubes. References 1. 	D. Felhös, J.
