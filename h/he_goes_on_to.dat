5|$|Troy McClure hosts this episode, which {{highlights}} individual {{scenes and}} sequences {{from throughout the}} series and offers never-before-seen outtakes. McClure starts the episode by showing a brief presentation of how The Simpsons series was conceived by Matt Groening, James L. Brooks, and Sam Simon. <b>He</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> present some clips of the original shorts that aired on The Tracey Ullman Show.|$|E
5|$|An investigative {{journalist}} whose articles notably relate to Daredevil, and the Kingpin. During the film, <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> uncover {{a lot of}} information about the two. Pantoliano was cast in March 2002. Urich works for the New York Post, rather than the Daily Bugle as in the comics, because the film rights to the Bugle were held by Sony Pictures at that time.|$|E
5|$|The book {{begins by}} looking at religion, {{specifically}} God as non-being and as being, put by Stace as the negative and positive divine. Stace then defines two orders of being - time and eternity, which he says intersect {{in the moment of}} mystic illumination. <b>He</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> say that the nature of God or eternity is such that all religious language is symbolic and that it is necessarily subject to contradictions.|$|E

50|$|Oda {{began the}} 2012-2013 season by winning gold at the 2012 Nebelhorn Trophy. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> win the bronze medal at 2012 Skate America and placed fifth at 2012 Rostelecom Cup. This did not qualify {{him for the}} Grand Prix Final. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> place fourth at Nationals, and thus was not named to the 2013 World Championships team. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> compete at the Bavarian Open, which he won.|$|R
5|$|Writing in Storyteller: The Classic that Heralded America's Storytelling Revival, in {{discussing}} the difference between stories that lend themselves well to telling and stories that lend themselves well to reading, Ramon Ross explains Peter Rabbit is a story created for reading. He believes Potter created a good mix of suspense and tension, intermixed with lulls in the action. <b>He</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> write that the writing style—"the economy of words, the crisp writing"—lends itself well to a young audience.|$|E
5|$|Michael Shermer {{argued in}} Scientific American in October 2006 that {{evolution}} supports concepts like family values, avoiding lies, fidelity, moral codes {{and the rule}} of law. <b>He</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> suggest that evolution gives more support to the notion of an omnipotent creator, rather than a tinkerer with limitations based on a human model, the more common image subscribed to by creationists. Careful analysis of the creationist charges that evolution has led to moral relativism and the Holocaust yields the conclusion that these charges appear to be highly suspect. Such analyses conclude that the origins of the Holocaust {{are more likely to be}} found in historical Christian anti-Semitism than in evolution.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the initial}} events of Rewrite, Kotarou had been a low-ranking member of Guardian posted in Kazamatsuri, where he {{encounters}} Kagari. In one timeline, Kotarou is badly injured by Kagari, though he is healed into a half-familiar existence by a young Kotori {{with a piece of}} Kagari's ribbon. Kotarou's aging is also slowed as a consequence. Kotarou falls into a coma, and he is administered an amnesiac drug to forget about Gaia and Guardian. By the time he wakes up, Kotori is in junior high school, and Kotarou later graduates junior high with Kotori. <b>He</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> spend time in high school with the occult research society as shown before. In a different timeline when he encounters Kagari, Kotarou lets her go.|$|E

5|$|When Marceau {{believes}} she has solved the murder, Poirot gathers the passengers and poses {{a series of}} questions to Marceau about the clues found. <b>He</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> reveal three possible solutions to Ratchett's death. The first two are identical to the novel. Poirot suggests that an assassin may have come aboard the train during the night, killed Cassetti, and then escaped the train, which is supported by evidence such as a bloodied stiletto with fingerprints that do not match anyone on the train. The second solution pieces together a number of clues showing that all of the trains' passengers and the conductor, Pierre Michel, are responsible for the murder, to which they confess.|$|E
5|$|Another {{noticeable}} {{difference in}} the storyline takes place when Zhou travels with his teenage disciples to visit his friend the Abbot. Instead of Yue wandering behind the temple to battle the magical snake, he stays with Zhou and the Abbot, while the other disciples go off to explore. Zhou watches as the Abbot tests Yue's strength by asking him to move an ornate three-hundred pound copper stove dating from the Han Dynasty. The abbot then lifts a stone floor tile and presents the boy with a large book on military strategy. <b>He</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> tell Yue how he was once a great soldier who fought in campaigns against the Liao and Western Xia empires, but became a monk after the Song agreed to become a vassal of each state. He later {{made a name for}} himself by teaching military skills to youths from the surrounding area. Since he has no heir of his own, the Abbot presents Yue with his own personal spear and instructs him in the proper use of the weapon. Zhou kindly protests the gift at first, but allows Yue to keep it out of friendship.|$|E
5|$|Later, Charlie finds Liam high on heroin with groupies. Charlie {{kicks the}} groupies out, and tells Liam that he's {{done with the}} band. Liam says to Charlie that he, Liam, is Drive Shaft, and that nobody knows who the bass player (Charlie) is. <b>He</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> tell Charlie that without the band, Charlie is nothing, which spurs Charlie to use heroin for the first time. Years later, Charlie visits Liam's house in Australia and wants Liam to rejoin Drive Shaft for a {{comeback}} tour. Liam declines, but the band can't do the tour without him. He criticizes Charlie for still using drugs, and Charlie blames Liam for getting him started with drugs. Liam asks Charlie {{to stay with him}} for a few weeks, saying that Sydney has some good rehab programs and that he can get Charlie help. Charlie angrily leaves, saying he has a plane to catch.|$|E

5|$|When Maximinus {{received}} {{notice that}} Constantine {{had succeeded in}} his campaign against Maxentius, he issued a new letter restoring Christians their former liberties. The text of this letter, which is preserved in Eusebius's Historia Ecclesiastica, however, suggests that the initiative was Maximinus's alone, and not that of Constantine or Licinius. It is also the only passage in the ancient sources providing Maximinus's rationale for his actions, without the hostility of Lactantius and Eusebius. Maximinus states that he supported Diocletian and Galerius's early legislation but, upon being made Caesar, came to realize the drain such policies would have on his labor force, and began to employ persuasion without coercion. <b>He</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> assert that he resisted petitions from Nicomedians to forbid Christians from their city (an event Eusebius does not otherwise record), and that when he accepted the demands of deputations from other cities he was only following imperial custom. Maximinus concludes his letter by referencing the letter he wrote after Galerius's edict, asking that his subordinates be lenient. He does not refer to his early letters, which encouraged avid persecution.|$|E
5|$|In Katherine Buetow's {{guide to}} the Australian Cattle Dog, Ian Dunbar {{makes the point that}} while people think of dog {{training}} as teaching a dog to sit, speak and roll over, the dog already knows how to do these things. Training, he says, involves teaching the dog that {{it is a good idea}} to do these things when a particular word is said or signal is given. <b>He</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> explain his belief that training is about opening communication channels, so that the dog knows what the handler wants it to do, and knows that it will be worth its while to do it. Consequences for the dog can be rewards for doing what is required, as recommended by Dunbar, or corrections where an unwanted behaviour is performed. Like other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is intelligent and responsive; both of these traits can be an advantage in training where a structured, varied program is used, but can lead to unwanted outcomes if training is not consistent, or is repetitive and boring for the dog. Stock dog trainer Scott Lithgow recommends making training a game so the Cattle Dog learns that obedience leads to enjoyment. Many of a Cattle Dog's natural behaviours are undesirable in a pet: barking, chewing, chasing, digging, defending territory, and nipping heels. Training, therefore, involves helping the dog adopt a lifestyle that is probably very different from that of its droving ancestors. The Australian Cattle Dog is biddable, and responds well to training.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} in a {{different}} place for each playable character. With the exception of Carlie, the main character is soon told (or otherwise decides) to seek the advice of the Priest of Light in the Holy City Wendel. They arrive at the city of Jadd soon after the Beastmen have invaded. Due to the Beastmen's werewolf powers, they are able to make an escape by night. The main character—now including Carlie—on the way to Wendel stays overnight in Astoria where they are woken by a bright light. Following it, it reveals itself to be a Faerie from the Mana Sanctuary, exhausted by her journey. Out of desperation, the Faerie chooses the main character to be her host, and tells them to get to Wendel. There, while they explain their grievances to the Priest of Light, the Faerie interrupts and explains that the Mana Tree is dying and that the Sanctuary is in danger. The Priest explains that if the Tree dies, the God Beasts will reawaken and destroy the world. <b>He</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> explain further that, because the Faerie has chosen the main character as its host, they must travel to the Sanctuary to draw the Sword of Mana from the foot of the Mana Tree. They can then restore peace to the world, and have their wishes granted by the Mana Goddess if the sword is drawn before the Tree dies. A great deal of power is needed to open the gate to the Sanctuary. The Faerie does not have the strength to do it, and the ancient spell which would do so by unlocking the power in the Mana Stones also takes the caster's life. The Stones' guarding elemental spirits, however, will to be able to open the gate if their powers are combined.|$|E

25|$|Explaining how sacraments are means or instruments, not ends in themselves, Francis says: <b>He</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> {{say that}} true disciples {{encounter}} the Lord in the sacraments and receive {{the power to}} follow Jesus' teaching.
