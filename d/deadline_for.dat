5|$|A {{coalition}} Government of National Union {{was installed}} {{in the capital of}} Vientiane, but it soon ran into difficulties. By the 2 October 1962 <b>deadline</b> <b>for</b> the removal of foreign troops, the North Vietnamese had pulled out only 40 personnel, leaving approximately 6,000 troops in the eastern half of the country. Meanwhile, rightist elements (in control of the army) opposed the new government. The U.S. played its part by increasing its assistance to the right by covertly supplying the army through Thailand. Despite another international accord, Laos remained ensnared by the political and territorial ambitions of communist neighbors, the security concerns of Thailand and the United States, and geographic fate.|$|E
5|$|All ballots, {{absentee}} ballot envelopes, and voting machines were impounded under a court injunction sought by state Republicans.

Absentee ballots mailed within the United States had to be received by April 7 to be counted. The <b>deadline</b> <b>for</b> overseas (including military) ballots was extended to April 13 after the United States Department of Justice sued the state to ensure {{they would have a}} reasonable chance of being counted. Counting of the absentee ballots due by April 7 began on April 8 under a New York State Supreme Court ruling sought by Murphy's campaign.|$|E
