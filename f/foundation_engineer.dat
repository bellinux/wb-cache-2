5000|$|Harry Bolton Seed {{was born}} in Bolton, England, on August 19, 1922 into a family of a cotton mill manager. His father was Arthur Bolton Seed, and his mother's maiden name was Annie Wood; his sister Dorothy was nine years older than he was. He spent his {{childhood}} in Lancashire and attended Farnworth Grammar School, where he exhibited talent both at sports and academics. At the age of eighteen he chose a scholarship to King's College London over a possible professional soccer career. Seed's studies were interrupted by the Second World War, when he served the military as a lieutenant. After military service, Seed returned to the University of London to finish his study, and received a B.Sc. in Civil Engineering in 1944 and a Ph.D. in Structural Engineering in 1947. His thesis title was [...] "Non-elastic deformations in concrete and their effects on design". Seed also captained the University of London's soccer team, and the All-England team during this period. Following two years as assistant lecturer at King's College, Seed came to Harvard University to study soil mechanics {{under the tutelage of}} engineering giants Karl Terzaghi and Arthur Casagrande. He received his S.M. degree from Harvard in 1948 and spent the next year as an instructor at Harvard, followed by a year as a <b>foundation</b> <b>engineer</b> for Thomas Worcester, Inc., in Boston.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{analysis}} of elastic stability for continuously restrained Euler columns is conducted {{by means of}} variational iteration method (VIM). A uniform homogeneous column {{is assumed to be}} restrained along its length. The restraint considered in this study is an elastic foundation model in engineering practice and it is of great interest to <b>foundation</b> <b>engineers.</b> Hence, the variation of the critical buckling loads with the stiffness of elastic restraint is investigated using VIM for the restrained columns with different end conditions. Obtaining analytical solutions for these types of problems is not a simple procedure since the equations of stability criteria are highly nonlinear. This study presents the application of VIM for obtaining exact solutions for continuously restrained Euler columns. The study proves that VIM is a very efficient and promising approach in the elastic stability {{analysis of}} specified problems...|$|R

40|$|Pile {{foundations}} {{are usually}} recommended when soil capacity {{is not sufficient}} for the expected loads of the structure with conventional foundation techniques. While the case. of vertical piles is reasonably documented in the literature, the case of batter piles in sand has received little attention from the researchers. This is mainly due {{to the complexity of}} modeling the earth pressure distribution around the pile's shaft. Attempts were made to model the pullout behavior of vertical piles numerically using two-dimensional approaches, which does not represent the field condition and accordingly the results are scattering. In this study a 3 D numerical model was developed to investigate the uplift capacity of single batter piles in sand. The model utilizes the powerful software "ABAQUS" version 6. 6, which is capable to model such complex interaction in three-dimensional stress analysis. The model was validated with the prototype test results of Hanna and Afram (1986) and field work of Alewnah (1999) Design procedure and design charts have been presented to assist <b>foundation</b> <b>engineers</b> to predict the uplift capacity of batter piles in sand...|$|R

But, due to the nature of the action of the microwave, the trend contrary to this was observed in a microwave oven. Therefore, in order to explain this phenomenon, internal temperature of soil specimen was measured by a digital thermometer. As a result, it was obtained that the typical two internal temperature- drying time curves corresponded to the typical two degree of drying-drying time curves in a microwave oven; a series of curves were observed for compacted soil sample, in which a digital thermometer registered 120 ℃ at maximum temperature, and the other series of curves were observed for disturbed soil sample, in which the thermometer registered less than 110 ℃ at maximum temperature...|$|R

40|$|The {{ultimate}} {{bearing capacity}} of shallow foundations under axial vertical loads on dense sand overlying deep loose deposit has been investigated. In the literature, several theories can be found using simplified failure mechanisms {{in conjunction with the}} punching shear failure. Accordingly, assumptions were used to simplify the evaluation of the level of mobilization of the shear strength on the punching column. This is mainly due to the complexity of modeling the earth pressure distribution on the punching column. In this study a numerical model was developed to investigate the case of continuous footing on dense sand overlying loose sand. The model utilizes the powerful software "PLAXIS" version 8. 6, which is capable to model such complex interaction in two-dimensional stress analysis. The model was validated with the prototype test results of Meyerhof and Hanna (1978) and Hanna (1981 - a). The results of this investigation showed that the shear strength mobilized on the punching column depends on the relative strength of the two layers, the width of the footing and the thickness and angle of shearing resistance of the upper layer.
