40|$|The {{hydraulic}} circuit, {{through which}} the mineral oil is brought, {{is an important part}} of hydrostatic bearings. The annular <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> consists of two sliding plates divided by a layer of mineral oil. In the lower plate, there are oil grooves which distribute the liquid between the sliding areas. The hydraulic circuit is made of two basic parts: the energy source and the controlling part. The hydraulic pump, which brings the liquid into the sliding bearing, is the source of the pressure energy. The sliding bearing is weighted down by axial force, which can be changed during the process. That´s why in front of the particular oil grooves control components adjusting pressure and flow size are located.

40|$|Hydrostatic bearing finds wide {{application}} in machine tools with various technologies {{because of their}} high stiffness and damping characteristic.

40|$|Next {{generation}} precision machines {{will require}} ever more rigid elements {{to achieve the}} required machining tolerances. The presented work focuses on the application of ultra stiff servo-controllable kinematic couplings and hydrostatic bearings to minimize the structural loop of multi-axis precision grinding machines while reducing complexity. The fundamental importance of these ultra stiff, adjustable machine elements is demonstrated {{in the design of}} a grinding machine for 450 mm diameter silicon wafers. A new generation of silicon wafer grinding machines is needed to back-grind large (450 mm diameter) wafers from the production thickness of up to 1 mm down to less than 50 pm so as to reduce the cost of Si-wafer based components. The grinding process {{needs to be done in}} about 90 sec (fine-grinding, e. g. - 200 micron) to 160 sec (coarse grinding, e. g. - 600 micron). After completion of the fine grinding process the wafer must be flat to 0. 1 pm/o 45 mm and parallel to 0. 6 pm/ 450 mm diameter. The surface roughness must be less than Rymax 0. 1 pm and Ra 0. 01 pm. Even though the required machining forces are 1 N/nm is required, which is many times stiffer than a typical machine tool (0. 1 to 0. 3 N/nm). In cooperation with industry, this work had the aim of creating a new machine design philosophy, with an example application that focuses on nano-adjustable kinematic coupling and feedback controlled water hydrostatic bearing technology. This new design philosophy is needed to enable the design of a relatively small footprint, compact precision machines. In particular, a ball screw preloaded height adjustable kinematic coupling and a magnetically preloaded <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> were designed and built. The adjustable kinematic coupling allows for up to 8 mm of vertical height adjust and 7 N/nm stiffness at 26 kN preload. By varying the preload on the coupling by +/- 10 %, in-process nm to micron height and tilt adjustment at > 95 % of the nominal stiffness is possible. Under the assumption of a constant flow supply, the hydrostatic bearing achieves a theoretical stiffness of 1 N/ nm at a 20 micron bearing gap and 7000 N combined gravitational and magnetic preload. In practice, the stiffness is limited by the pressure flow characteristics of the supplying pumps. To increase the bearing stiffness to a required 4 N/ nm, various control loops have been developed and tested. by Gerald Rothenhöfer. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} encountered for the successful operation of high-power-density micro-devices lies in the stable operation of the bearings supporting the high-speed rotating machinery. This thesis presents the analysis, design, microfabrication, testing and operation of high speed micro-hydrostatic gas bearings for microturbomachinery in power-MEMS applications. A novel turbine driven microbearing test device for demonstrating repeatable high-speed gas bearing operation was designed, microfabricated and tested. The new microbearing test device incorporates numerous features, including a four plena journal bearing feed system enabling both isotropic and anisotropic journal bearing operation, labyrinth seals for reducing rotordynamic coupling, a redesigned turbine for satisfying power requirements, reinforced <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> structural design, a novel rotor fabrication technology for achieving low radial imbalance and a symmetric feed system to avoid rotor sideloading arising from pressure or flow non-uniformities. A rigorous theory is presented to analyze the effects of compressibility in micro-flows (characterized by low Reynolds numbers and high Mach numbers) through <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings</b> for application to microturbomachines. (cont.) Operating protocols for ensuring <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> static stability have been established and successfully demonstrated on several micro-devices in the MIT Microengine Project. In addition, a simple and useful dynamic stability criterion has been identified: Dynamic instability occurs when the flow through both <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings</b> chokes. A-priori dynamic stability predictions were subsequently verified experimentally {{for the first time}} on a micro-turbocharger. A generalized Green's function approach has been successfully implemented for analyzing tilting effects and geometric non-uniformities in micro-hydrostatic gas <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings.</b> The effects of a non fully-developed circumferential flow in low length-to-diameter ratio (L/D << 1) micro-hydrostatic journal bearings are analyzed for the first time. Effects on journal bearing whirl stability and viscous power dissipation are quantified using a simple analytical model and CFD calculations. A dimensionless parameter characterizing the ratio of the flow-through time of the axial hydrostatic flow to the viscous diffusion time was identified to govern the evolution of the circumferential flow field. Singular behavior of the stability boundary or whirl-ratio occurs when the flow through time of the axial hydrostatic flow is approximately half the characteristic viscous diffusion time. (cont.) Operating conditions for high speed, stable journal bearing operation can thus be ascertained. Experimental techniques and data reduction schemes facilitating the evaluation of key journal bearing rotordynamic information such as the stiffness, natural frequency and damping ratio, as well as the imbalance of the rotor have been successfully implemented. Imbalance-driven whirl response curves for providing an improved understanding of the rotordynamic behavior of micro-hydrostatic gas journal bearings have been obtained for the first time. Effects of journal bearing width and anisotropy are systematically investigated on the redesigned microbearing test device. For low levels of journal differential pressures DP, high whirl ratios ranging between 20 and 40 were achieved. These whirl-ratios were one order of magnitude higher than those encountered in macro-scale journal bearings. Almost all devices tested anisotropically at high values of DP achieved speeds in excess of 1 million rpm. The improvements in bearings and seals design, the high reliability of the novel microfabrication processes, and the repeatability and successful implementation of the operating protocols were vindicated. (cont.) A first-of-a-kind controlled high speed operation up to 70 % of the design speed was also demonstrated. This corresponds to a rotation rate of 1. 7 million rpm, a rotor tip speed of 370 m/s and a DN number of 7 million mm-rpm. The technical feasibility of high-speed gas bearings required for achieving high power densities in MEMS-based micro-turbomachinery has thus been experimentally demonstrated. by Chiang Juay Teo.

40|$|The "classic" {{solution}} {{for the support of}} a translating lockgate, the wheelonrail support, has relatively high construction as well as inspection and maintenance costs. An alternative support which has previously been developed for use in the Prins WillemAlexander lock is the socalled "hydrosupport", a <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> that slides on an elastic track and is connected to the lockgate by an elastic support. After a runningin period, this support shows low friction. In this thesis several methods to further improve this type of support have been studied. The direction of these improvements has been guided by the following observation: The typical dimensions and manufacturing standards of the bearing and the track are in conflict. On the large scale of a lockgate, a hydrostatic bearing typically requires sliding surfaces with a surface waviness smaller than 0. 1 mm/m. However, the track can not be manufactured easily with a surface waviness smaller than typically 0. 5 mm/m. This means that contact between the bearing and track will be inevitable. In this thesis, methods have been studied to use this contact in order to improve the performance (namely reduced flow rate and pumping power) of the hydrosupport. A mathematical model has been developed, incorporating the elastic deformation of the track, bearing and support, and the partial contact and hydrostatic lubricating film between the bearing and track. Several track waviness models have been developed, among others a random periodic surface waviness. Furthermore the concept of an "ideal" support has been introduced, which under compression exhibits a reaction pressure equal to the hydrostatic pressure in a lubricating film with a constant height. Not only has this mathematical model been developed in this thesis, it has also been implemented in a numerical program and used to test the influence of a number of design parameters on the performance of a hydrosupport. It has been shown that, using the contact between the sliding surfaces, the tilting stiffness of a bearing with 1 small recess is comparable to that of the 4 -recess bearing. Additionally, a 1 recess bearing requires a smaller or even no restrictor and therefore a smaller supply pump. Furthermore, {{it has been shown that}} the hydrofender with its large length/width ratio has comparable or even better performance than the circular hydrofoot, while requiring a narrower track. In addition, it has been shown that, for a given load, a hydrofender with a small bearing thickness and with a standard elastic support design exhibits a smaller flow rate and larger bearing coefficient than a bearing with an ideal support design. Finally, using the results of these parametric studies, a procedure has been developed for the design of hydrosupports. This procedure has been used in two examples.

40|$|A bulk-flow {{analysis}} and computer program for prediction of the static load performance and dynamic force coefficients of angled injection, orifice-compensated hydrostatic/hydrodynamic thrust bearings have been completed. The {{product of the}} research is an efficient computational tool {{for the design of}} high-speed thrust bearings for cryogenic fluid turbopumps. The study addresses the needs of a growing technology that requires of reliable fluid film bearings to provide the maximum operating life with optimum controllable rotordynamic characteristics at the lowest cost. The motion of a cryogenic fluid on the thin film lands of a thrust bearing is governed by a set of bulk-flow mass and momentum conservation and energy transport equations. Mass flow conservation and a simple model for momentum transport within the hydrostatic bearing recesses are also accounted for. The bulk-flow model includes flow turbulence with fluid inertia advection, Coriolis and centrifugal acceleration effects on the bearing recesses and film lands. The cryogenic fluid properties are obtained from realistic thermophysical equations of state. Turbulent bulk-flow shear parameters are based on Hirs' model with Moody's friction factor equations allowing a simple simulation for machined bearing surface roughness. A perturbation analysis leads to zeroth-order nonlinear equations governing the fluid flow for the thrust bearing operating at a static equilibrium position, and first-order linear equations describing the perturbed fluid flow for small amplitude shaft motions in the axial direction. Numerical solution to the zeroth-order flow field equations renders the bearing flow rate, thrust load, drag torque and power dissipation. Solution to the first-order equations determines the axial stiffness, damping and inertia force coefficients. The computational method uses well established algorithms and generic subprograms available from prior developments. The Fortran 9 O computer program hydrothrust runs on a Windows 95 /NT personal computer. The program, help files and examples are licensed by Texas A&M University Technology License Office. The study of the static and dynamic performance of two hydrostatic/hydrodynamic bearings demonstrates the importance of centrifugal and advection fluid inertia effects for operation at high rotational speeds. The first example considers a conceptual <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> for an advanced liquid hydrogen turbopump operating at 170, 000 rpm. The large axial stiffness and damping coefficients of the bearing should provide accurate control and axial positioning of the turbopump and also allow for unshrouded impellers, therefore increasing the overall pump efficiency. The second bearing uses a refrigerant R 134 a, and its application in oil-free air conditioning compressors is of great technological importance and commercial value. The computed predictions reveal that the LH 2 bearing load capacity and flow rate increase with the recess pressure (i. e. increasing orifice diameters). The bearing axial stiffness has a maximum for a recess pressure rati of approx. 0. 55. while the axial damping coefficient decreases as the recess pressure ratio increases. The computer results from three flow models are compared. These models are a) inertialess, b) fluid inertia at recess edges only, and c) full fluid inertia at both recess edges and film lands. The full inertia model shows the lowest flow rates, axial load capacity and stiffness coefficient {{but on the other hand}} renders the largest damping coefficients and inertia coefficients. The most important findings are related to the reduction of the outflow through the inner radius and the appearance of subambient pressures. The performance of the refrigerant hybrid thrust bearing is evaluated at two operating speeds and pressure drops. The computed results are presented in dimensionless form to evidence consistent trends in the bearing performance characteristics. As the applied axial load increases, the bearing film thickness and flow rate decrease while the recess pressure increases. The axial stiffness coefficient shows a maximum for a certain intermediate load while the damping coefficient steadily increases. The computed results evidence the paramount of centrifugal fluid inertia at low recess pressures (i. e. low loads), and where there is actually an inflow through the bearing inner diameter, accompanied by subambient pressures just downstream of the bearing recess edge. These results are solely due to centrifugal fluid inertia and advection transport effects. Recommendations include the extension of the computer program to handle flexure pivot tilting pad hybrid bearings and the ability to calculate moment coefficients for shaft angular misalignments...|$|E

40|$|The rotordynamic {{coefficients}} of fixed-pad <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> are introduced and calculated {{by using the}} out-domain method, and a general analysis method is developed to investigate the coupled dynamics of a rotor equipped with journal and <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings</b> simultaneously. Considerations include the effects of static tilt parameters of the rotor on rotordynamic {{coefficients of}} <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> and the action of <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> on system dynamics. It is shown that <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> changes the load distribution of journal bearings and the static deflection of the rotor and delays the instability of the system considerably in lateral shaft vibration...|$|R

40|$|International audiencen this work, the {{non-linear}} dynamic {{behavior of}} a flexible shaft is presented. The shaft is mounted in two journal bearings and axial load {{is supported by a}} hydrodynamic <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing,</b> at one end. The coupling between the axial <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> behavior and the bending vibrations of the shaft is especially studied. The shaft is modeled by a typical beam finite element method and includes gyroscopic effects. The dynamic behavior of the journal <b>bearings</b> and the <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> are considered to be non-linear. The dynamic behavior is analyzed with a transient time integration procedure. The <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> provides additional stiffness and additional damping on the flexible shaft. A defect on the <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> rotor excites a critical speed...|$|R
40|$|Case StudyA {{centrifugal}} compressor in olefins plant charge gas service experienced excessive <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> temperatures after startup following a field overhaul and rerate. While {{the machine was}} online, an analytical study was carried out to determine the possible causes for the excessive <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> temperature. The study involved confirmation of the aero load through calculation, verifying the <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing?s</b> capacity {{with the use of}} computer modeling, and correlation with operating field data to determine the likely cause of <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> distress. A mechanical test of an identical spare bearing was conducted on an existing <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> test rig to confirm the results of the analytical study and field observations. A compressor outage was ultimately required to remedy the <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> issue. A methodical approach to the shutdown work was employed to assure detection and correction of the cause for the <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> distress while minimizing the duration of the plant outage. The approach included full scale oil flow rate testing in the field as well as a comprehensive bearing disassembly and inspection plan. The culprit for the excessive <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> temperature was discovered and corrected allowing for successful compressor operation after restart. This case study examines non-intrusive analysis and test methods to understand the issue without the chance of repeated outages...|$|R
