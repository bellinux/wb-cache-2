As he leaves the party, Michael brings Gabe into the joke by threatening to kill him if he breaks Erin's heart.|$|E
25|$|Al Gore {{was unable}} to attend the table reads of the script, so Maurice LaMarche read his lines. He notes in the DVD {{commentary}} that Gore's daughter Kristin, who wrote for Futurama, was also at the table read, and <b>he</b> <b>jokes</b> that {{this was one of}} the highlights of his career. Additional voice roles in the episode include Tress MacNeille as Joan Rivers' preserved head in a jar and LaMarche as the headless body of Spiro Agnew. Billy West, who voices Nixon's head, says that his impression of Nixon is not meant to be an accurate impression but it intentionally plays up certain quirks and flaws. West also voices the C-3PO-esque robot which appears early in the Professor's flashback. He accomplished the voice effect by speaking into a coffee cup during the recording of the lines.|$|E
25|$|For Sport Relief 2010 on 19 March 2010, Corden {{appeared}} {{again as}} Smithy {{in a long}} sketch about coaching. Corden had previously recorded a live 9 minute segment during the December 2009 BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards ceremony. It sees Smithy being presented with the Coach of the Year Award for his unsung coaching influence on several British sports stars. As <b>he</b> <b>jokes</b> with the audience he declares he can't accept the award, {{and goes on to}} rant at the assembled sporting stars for having 'lost their way' and focusing on celebrity, ending on a rousing appeal to get back to basics, leaving hosts Sue Barker and Gary Lineker in mock tears. As a backstory, sketches are shown of how Smithy coached Tom Daley, Andrew Flintoff, Andy Murray, Jenson Button, David Beckham and the Manchester United team.|$|E

500|$|Robert Guillaume as Rafiki, a wise old {{mandrill}} (although, while counseling Simba, <b>he</b> <b>jokes</b> that [...] "you are a baboon, and I am not") {{who serves}} as shaman of the Pride Lands and presents newborn cubs of the King and Queen to the animals of the Pride Lands. James Baxter served as the supervising animator for Rafiki.|$|E
500|$|The finale {{marked the}} return of actor Kirk Acevedo as the Other Side FBI agent Charlie Francis. In the DVD audio commentary, the {{producers}} admit they [...] "faced a bit of hatred" [...] when they killed off Acevedo's character {{near the beginning of}} the season. [...] They were aware the entire time that Charlie exists in the parallel universe, and that [...] "nobody ever dies on Fringe. Acevedo describes the parallel universe version of his character as someone who is [...] "so much more fun." [...] He is subtly different, with a lighter personality; <b>he</b> <b>jokes</b> around more, and is less [...] "doom and gloom" [...] than the original character. Some viewers refer to the new character as [...] "alt-Charlie" [...] to differentiate the two. The actor, the producers, and some fans have called the new character [...] "Scarlie" [...] in reference to a scar on his cheek, which takes ten minutes to apply before shooting, according to Acevedo. Previous guest actors Orla Brady, Lily Pilblad, Ari Graynor, Omar Metwally, Ryan McDonald, and David Call appear in the finale, as well as new guest stars Philip Winchester and Pascale Hutton.|$|E
500|$|In the {{alternate}} timeline, Shannon {{does not go}} back with Boone. In [...] "LA X", Boone goes back alone on Flight 815 and sits beside Locke, where he finds out about Locke supposedly going on a Walkabout in Australia. In a parallel with the island timeline, Boone tells Locke if they crashed, he would follow him. Once the plane lands, Boone shakes Locke's hand and exits the plane. Boone reappears in the final episode of Lost. In [...] "The End", we see Hurley and Sayid talking in a car on a dark street, and they witness a thug beating up a guy (Boone) outside of a bar. Shannon shouts [...] "Leave my brother alone," [...] and Sayid {{gets out of the}} car to intervene. His and Shannon's memories are restored the moment they touch. Boone, having conspired with Hurley to bring Shannon and Sayid together, wanders over to the car. <b>He</b> <b>jokes</b> with Hurley about how he had to take a beating and [...] "thanks for taking your time." [...] He also comments how difficult it was to get Shannon to return from Australia with him, but he and Hurley agree the effort was worth it for this moment to have her and Sayid's memories restored. Boone is one of the first people Jack greets in the church where everyone reunites to move on to the afterlife together.|$|E

50|$|John Farnham {{finished}} his run {{of a record}} 76 concerts at the venue over three decades with a farewell gig December 16, 2015. <b>He</b> <b>joked</b> <b>he</b> got to take home the 6-foot entrance sign to the green room, dubbed 'The Farnham Room'.|$|R
2500|$|Matsumoto's hobbies include driving, billiards, {{and video}} games. He has played billiards against {{numerous}} musicians on the Downtown hosted music show, Hey! Hey! Hey! Music Champ, such as Gackt. His favorite video game is Tetris and says his nickname is [...] "The Tetrist" [...] (テトリスト). <b>He</b> <b>jokes</b> {{he can play}} Tetris until {{the corners of the}} blocks wear out and become rounded. However, in his televised Tetris battles with both Utada Hikaru (on Music Champ) and Shinya Arino of Yoiko (on LINCOLN), he showed mediocre skills and lost.|$|E
2500|$|For example, {{although}} the First Gravedigger is definitely in {{the fictional world}} of the play (he is digging Ophelia's grave), he also asks his fellow to [...] "go, get thee to Yaughan, fetch me a stoup of liquor". This {{does not appear in}} all versions and means little to us now, but it is [...] "generally supposed that [...] was a nearby inn-keeper [...] ". Likewise, the First Gravedigger is in the same world as the English audience of the time when <b>he</b> <b>jokes</b> [...] "... will not be seen in [...] there there the men are as mad as he". This gives enough of a [...] "distance from Elsinore [...] to view what the clowns say as discreet parallels, not direct commentaries".|$|E
2500|$|Harley Clark, {{who would}} later {{introduce}} the signal, {{got the idea for}} the hand-sign from his colleagues Tom Butts and Henry K. Pitts, who had been casting shadows on the wall at the Texas Union. [...] Clark {{was a member of the}} Tejas Club, as well as head cheerleader at UT, a position that was elected by the student body. [...] "It was second only in importance to the Texas governor," [...] <b>he</b> <b>jokes.</b> Clark showed an enthusiastic student body the sign a few nights later at a football pep rally at Gregory Gym. According to Neal Spelce, who attended the rally when he was a student at the university, [...] "a lot of people didn't get it right at first," [...] but it caught on rapidly from there. By the thousands, students extended an arm to create the now famous salute. The next day, at the Texas Longhorn vs. TCU football game, Clark stood in awe as the [...] "Hook 'em Horns" [...] hand sign surged from one side of the stadium to the other.|$|E

6000|$|But, {{in reading}} {{histories}} and biographies, we always accept with a bias {{in favor of}} the person described the anecdotes of those who talk of them. We know that the ready wit of the surrounding world has taken up these affairs of the moment and turned them into ridicule--then as they do now. We discount the [...] "Hierosolymarius." [...] We do not quite believe that Bibulus never left the house while an enemy was to be seen; but we think that a man may be expected to tell the truth of himself; at any rate, to tell no untruth against himself. We think that Cicero of all men may be left to do so--Cicero, who so well understood the use of words, and could use them in his own defence so deftly. I maintain that it has been that very deftness which has done him all the harm. Not one of those letters of the last years would have been written as it is now had Cicero thought, when writing it, that from it would his conduct have been judged after two thousand years. [...] "No," [...] will say my readers, [...] "that is their value; they would not have otherwise been true, as they are. We should not then have learned his secrets." [...] I reply, [...] "It is a hard bargain to make: others do not make such bargains on the same terms. But be sure, at any rate, that you read them aright: be certain that you make the necessary allowances. Do not accuse him of falsehood because he unsays on a Tuesday the words he said on the Monday. Bear in mind on his behalf all the temporary ill that humanity is heir to. Could you, living at Brundisium during the summer months, 'when you were scarcely able to endure the weight of the sun,'[138] have had all your intellects about you, and have been able always to choose your words?" [...] No, indeed! These letters, if truth is to be expected from them, have to be read with all the subtle distinctions necessary for understanding the frame of mind in which they were written. His anger boils over here, and he is hot. Here tenderness has mastered him, and the love of old days. He is weak in body just now, and worn out in spirit; he is hopeless, almost to the brink of despair; he is bright with wit, he is full of irony, he is purposely enigmatic--all of which require an Atticus who knew him and the people among whom he had lived, and the times in which the events took place, for their special reading. Who is there can read them now so as accurately to decipher every intended detail? Then comes some critic who will not even attempt to read them--who rushes through them by the light of some foregone conclusion, and missing {{the point at which the}} writer subtly aims, tells us of some purpose of which he was altogether innocent! Because <b>he</b> <b>jokes</b> about the augurship, we are told how miserably base he was, and how ready to sell his country! ...|$|E
