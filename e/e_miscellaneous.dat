40|$|We {{focus on}} the {{empirical}} techniques used most often {{in the analysis of}} financial markets and how they are applied to actual market data. The tentative list of topics includes: (a) statistical properties of asset returns, (b) tests of asset pricing models (CAPM, APT, Intertemporal CAPM, Consumption CAPM), (c) efficient markets hypothesis, (d) event study methodology; and (<b>e)</b> <b>miscellaneous</b> topics (e. g. chaos and nonlinear dynamics, portfolio performance evaluation, term structure of interest rates, valuation of corporate debt, pricing derivative assets, market microstructure, international finance). The relative emphasis that each topic receives within category (e) will depend on the interests of the students. 2. Class Meetings and Format We will meet each Monday and Wednesday, 11 : 30 am- 1 : 20 pm in Gerlach 315. Each week, I will assign relevant readings. These readings will consist of statistical background readings at times and specific papers in empirical financial economics. You are expected to read much of the material before the class. The class will not follow a lecture format; rather, I will act as the discussion leader and background resource, especially as it come...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to ascertain whether variant student names would have an influence upon the (1) grades, (2) number of mechanical errors, (3) number of content errors, (4) number of miscellaneous positive comments, or (5) number of miscellaneous negative comments which community college English instructors would mark on a student essay. During the Spring Semester of 1979, 404 community college English instructors were mailed an identical essay whereon only the ascribed student name varied. Of these 404, 246 instructors returned usable test instruments. This represented a response rate of 60. 9 percent. Thirty instructors marked an essay ascribed to the first name Daniel; 30, Frederick; 31, George; and 34, James. Another group of 30 instructors marked an essay ascribed to Buschbacher; 32, Etheredge; 31, Kronowski; and 28, Mendez. The letter grades were converted to a numerical scale (from 0 = F through 12 = A+) for computational purposes. Counts were made of the number of marked mechanical errors, content errors, miscellaneous positive comments, and miscellaneous negative comments. Ten separate analyses of variance were performed to determine the degree of relationship between the ascribed names and the dependent measures. No statistically significant relationship was found between first names and grades, mechanical errors, content errors, and miscellaneous positive comments. Nor was any relationship found between surnames and grades, mechanical errors, content errors, and miscellaneous negative comments. A statistically significant relationship was found between first names and miscellaneous negative comments. The post hoc Scheffe test was performed. The test data indicated that the essay ascribed to George received the highest mean number of miscellaneous negative comments while the essay ascribed to Daniel received the lowest mean number of miscellaneous negative comments. A statistically significant relationship was also found between surnames and miscellaneous positive comments. The post hoc Scheffe test data indicated that the essay ascribed to Mendez received the highest mean number of miscellaneous positive comments, followed in order by Etheredge, Buschbacher, and Kronowski. On the basis of these findings, two conclusions were offered. Community college English instructors were not influenced by variant first names or surnames in "professional" marks, i. e., grades, mechanical errors, and content errors. However, community college English instructors may have been partially subject to the influences of variant first names and surnames in "non-professional" marks, i. <b>e.,</b> <b>miscellaneous</b> negative and positive comments. These findings and conclusions were not consistent with earlier studies. The influences of name stereotypes in this study appeared to be more subtle than found in earlier studies. This study was inconclusive in isolating the source of personal name stereotypes. The question of whether name stereotypes are derived from social stereotypes or from a "kernel of truth" remained...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Inner speech {{involvement}} in self-reflection was examined by reviewing 130 studies assessing brain activation during self-referential processing in key self-domains: agency, self-recognition, emotions, personality traits, autobiographical memory, and <b>miscellaneous</b> (<b>e.</b> g., prospection, judgments). The left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) {{has been shown}} to be reliably recruited during inner speech production. The percentage of studies reporting LIFG activity for each self-dimension was calculated. Fifty five percent of all studies reviewed indicated LIFG (and presumably inner speech) activity during self-reflection tasks; on average LIFG activation is observed 16 % of the time during completion of non-self tasks (e. g., attention, perception). The highest LIFG activation rate was observed during retrieval of autobiographical information. The LIFG was significantly more recruited during conceptual tasks (e. g., prospection, traits) than during perceptual tasks (agency and self-recognition). This constitutes additional evidence supporting the idea of a participation of inner speech in self-related thinking...|$|R

40|$|Associations between trait {{empathy and}} {{criminal}} versatility {{were examined in}} a sample of 88 incarcerated adult sexual offenders (29 extrafamilial child molesters, 26 intrafamilial child molesters, and 33 rapists). Considerable criminal versatility was observed, with 60 % of the whole sample and 88 % of recidivist offenders having previous convictions for nonsexual offenses. Regression analyses showed significant associations between trait empathy and nonsexual offense convictions, but not between trait empathy and sexual offense convictions. More specifically, greater involvement in violent offending (e. g., assault, robbery) was associated with lower levels of empathic concern and higher levels of fantasy. Greater involvement in <b>miscellaneous</b> (<b>e.</b> g., traffic, drug, public order) offending was associated with lower levels of empathic concern. We argue that insufficient theoretical and empirical attention has historically been given to criminal versatility among sexual offenders, especially among child molesters. In particular, we suggest that developments in empathy training for sexual offenders may benefit from distinguishing needs of criminally versatile and non-versatile sexual offenders. More knowledge about trait empathy in sexual offenders, and about situational factors that may override otherwise normal empathic responsiveness, is needed.

40|$|The {{splashing}} of a {{water drop}} is a fascinating phenomenon that results {{from a variety of}} complex interactions between the drop and the material it impacts. In general, the distribution of droplets of a splash depends on the drop size and velocity; the surface roughness, rigidity, and wetness; and the angle of impact. Given the number of factors involved, it is difficult to develop an analytical model for the splash distribution. Instead, we take an empirical approach. We have measured the splashing behaviors of 22 different materials that are commonly found in the real world. These materials can be broadly classified as rough (e. g., wood and brick), smooth (e. g., marble and glass), flexible (e. g., silk and paper), and <b>miscellaneous</b> (<b>e.</b> g., water and moss). We have developed a stochastic model for splash distribution that builds upon empirical models previously developed in fluid dynamics and meteorology. Our model is simple and only requires 7 coefficients for generating splashes for head-on impact for a material. A more general model for generating splashes for arbitrary impact angles (due to surface inclination or wind) requires 54 coefficients. The models of different materials may be combined to generate physically plausible splashes for novel materials that have not been measured. Our model is applicable for rendering splashes due to rain as well as water drops falling from large heights such as windowsills, trees, and rooftops. 1...|$|R
40|$|National audienceThe {{functional}} properties of a protein depend mainly on its three-dimensional (3 D) structure. They are classically assigned, visualized and analysed {{through the prism}} of classical secondary structures composed of repetitive parts (α-helices for 1 / 3 rd of the residues and β-strands for 1 / 5 th, resp.) connected by coil. Two other repetitive structures also exist, namely the PolyProline II and the β-turns. The β-turns have been characterized by a hydrogen bond between N-H and C=O of residues i and i+ 3 by Venkatachalam [1]. He also characterized the first β-turn types. Later novel turns were defined, some being discarded, leading to a final collection of type I, I’, II, II’, IV, VIa 1, VIa 2, VIb, and VIII β-turns. Types VIa 1, VIa 2 and VIb are characterized by the presence of a cis-Proline at residue i+ 2. Turns that do not fit any of the above criteria are classified as type IV [2]. β-turn IV, i. <b>e.</b> the <b>miscellaneous</b> category, represents near 1 / 3 rd of β-turn residues in protein structure, and is the second most frequent β -turn. 25 years have passed since the last proposition of an extension of the classical definition of β-turns. Over all we have known, it seems a good moment to dig them and to see if some new recurrent conformations are not hidden into this miscellaneous type. An automatic clustering approach based on the rules of β-turn type assignment was designed to search for recurrent new turns inside this miscellaneous type. The four most occurring clusters defined the new β-turn types. Surprisingly, these types, named IV 1, IV 2, IV 3 and IV 4, represent half of the type IV β-turns, and are more frequent that many established ones.

40|$|This study {{describes}} habitat {{choice of}} the Surinam black spider monkey (Atelespaniscuspaniscus) and clarifies complex temporal and spatial effects of food sources on the behaviour {{of a group of}} spider monkeys in a 350 ha study area in central Surinam in terms of food category, food plant identity and phenology, and in terms of quantity, density and dispersion of {{the most important of these}} food sources. It recognizes the fundamental importance of mature-fruit feeding to spider-monkey foraging strategy and discusses implications of diet to social behaviour, Prom a conservational point of view. this study in essential in emphasizing the extreme vulnerability of the spider monkey to both hunting and habitat destruction, and in providing detailed information on its habitat choice and dietary requirements. so urgently needed in order to assess in a responsible way the mite of areas to protect and the potential of already preposed protected areas. The spider monkey may serve an an important 'indicator' species, reflecting the degree of disturbance of Amazonian tropical rain forests, 1, 2, 3, Among the eight Surinam monkey species, Atelesp. paniscus is the most restricted in habitat. In the Voltzberg region. it occurs exclusively in high forest (92. 6 %), infrequently enters edge habitats (14. 9 %) and is found primarily in the upper levels of the canopy and in emergents (72, 3 %), The understory is rarely used (0. 8 %), and the lower extreme of its vertical range appears to be 12 meters. Among the seven major forest types available in the Raleighvallen-Voltzberg region, spider monkeys are observed only in high rain forest. mountain savanna forest, pine. swamp forest and riverbank high forest. 4. A total of 207 food plant species are used, of which 68. 1 % trees. Most important families, providing the monkeys with food, are Moraceae and Mimosaceae regarding both the number of food species and the percentage of total feeding records. Atelesp. paniscus is mainly frugivorous. feeding on 171 species of fruit, 33 species of flower and 28 species of leaf. Mature fruit makes up 96 % of the total number of fruit feeding records. The occasional feeding on insects (termites and caterpillars) definitively has been ascertained. The average annual food intake in 82. 9 % fruits. 6, 4 % flowers, 7. 9 % flush leaves, 1. 7 % bark and 1. 0 % <b>miscellaneous</b> (<b>e.</b> g., rotten palmsheaths, pseudobulbs, aerial roots, honey, insects). The monthly variation in food choice shows a strong correlation with the phenology. During the first part of the long dry season (July - September), a period of low fruit supply. the monkey compensates its diet with relatively high percen tages of both flowers and flush leaves, while during the long wet season (March - June) fruit abundance causes very low percentages of both flowers and flush leaves in the diet. The percentages are strongly determined individually by its supply in relation to the ecological change, but ripe fruits always are preferred above all. Young seeds play a minor overall role in the diet, except during the period May - June, By ingesting large quantities of young needs# rich in protein and fat, during the peak of the long wet season the monkeys seem to stock up on energy for the coming months of food scarcity (July - October). Ateles appeared to play an important role as dispersal agent for may plant species, and for none species it seemed to be the only disperser. Endozoochorical seed dispersal by spider monkeys took place in 138 plant species (accounting for 93, 5 % of total fruit feeding records), seed dropping was recorded in 10 species (2, 7 %) and seed predation in 23 species 3. 7 %). Ateles belongs to the category of 'specialized frugivores', who derive all or most of their supplies of carbohydrate, lipid and protein from fruits. Large-seeded, nutritious fruits &sea to have coevolved with specialized frugivores an their principal dispersal agents, resulting in a greater quality of dispersal than can be aeon in small-seeded, low nutritious fruits dispersed by a wide array of both 'opportunistic' and 'specialized' fruit-eating animals. This coevolutionary pattern (the high nutritive content of the flesh in large-seeded fruits) way be demon strated in families such as Palmae, Burseraceae. Myristicaceae, Sapindaceae, Loxaniaceael Capparaceae, Sapotaceae and Meliaceae, all producing important fruits for spider monkeys. Among 166 plant species producing edible fruits. used by the spider monkeys in the Voltzberg region, about 80 % in nutritious and large-seeded. Low-nutritious, small-seeded fruits (especially berries and figs), making up only 20 %, were exploited only incidentally on the way from one nutritious fruit source to another, and almost never appeared to influence the daily foraging routes nor ware revisited regularly. These species often produce mass-ripened fruit crops on which the monkeys cannot depend much, The fruiting seasons of the former category, however, in general last relatively long because of wore or lens asynchronous fruit-maturing within and between indivi duals of the species, apparently mince the small number of specialized dispersal agents way be easily overloaded. The competition between these plant species for the high-quality dispersal offered by a small number of dispersers may have evolved in elongated and displaced, but broadly overlapping fruiting seasons as required for the existence of specialized frugivores. 5, Foraging behaviour in spider monkeys in differing strikingly with the seasons. During the long wet season, when fruit is abundant, activity budgets are increased resulting in large day ranges (with a maximum of 5. 000 meters), prolonged feeding times, short resting times and many food sources (especially mature fruits) exploited daily. Foraging often takes place in relatively large subgroups breaking up and reassembling regularly,, the subparties using partly different food sources but follow ing about similar itineraries. During the long dry season, when fruit supply is low and a food scarcity or even a food shortage way exist. activity budgets are lowered to a minimum. resulting in short day ranges (with a minimum of 500 meters), prolonged resting times and short feeding times (tow relatively long feeding bouts), few food sources exploited daily and diet composition differing in much higher percentages of flowers and flush leaves. Finally, mean subgroup size is decreased strongly. Spider monkeys live in medium-sized groups fragmenting into widely dis persed subgroups of varying composition. Daily itineraries and activity patterns of a subgroup mostly are determined by a so-called dominant (usually aged) female with or without offspring, or sometimes by two dominant females alternately. These females appear to possess the beet knowledge of certain parts of the group's range, the so-called core areas, and are capable of preplanning an economic foraging route for the day along an much as 8 to 30 different food sources. By checking regularly potential food sources on their stage of maturing and using a highly developed spatial and temporal memory, these females are able to incorporate these food sources in their foraging routes just after becoming available. The interval between subsequent visits to a particular food source appears to be species specific. depending on the rate of fruit maturing. In some species the last stage of maturing in going fast, offering the monkeys every day enough ripe fruits to feed on together. Many species, however, are exploited in a 2 days cycle. some in a 5 - 8 days cycle or even more. Spider monkeys appear to select for variety. using on average about 14 different food items daily. making up about a quarter of the average monthly number of food items used, Among these. 3 or 4 food items are most important considering the amount of feeding time and the estimated total weight of food ingested, 6, A group of Atelesp. paniscus usually consists of 15 - 20 individuals. although they way never be observed all together at the same place. A group fragments into several subgroups of varying composition, a female with offspring of an age ranging from 0 to about 5 years being the only persistent bond. Sex ratio of adult males to females is 1 : 2 (- 3). The adult males of a group appear to defend a territory with clearcut boundaries, while fema les sometimes visit neighbouring groups and even may emigrate. Spider-monkey social system is characterized by its flexible grouping behaviour and seems to be coevolved with the species food specialism concerning mainly nutritious. large-seeded fruits. The supply of this type of food is varying strongly with the seasons and maturing within and between individual fruiting plants. in general. is rather slow and asynchronous. Moreover, individual mature fruits of this type are short ly available to the monkey. After becoming mature. most fruits moon drop to the ground or when dehiscent, become available to birds. For more than three large-sized spider monkeys these food plants seldom offer enough to feed on together and to make the visit worthwhile in terms of energy expenditure, Consequently, subgroups consisting of three or lens indi viduals are encountered most often throughout the year. However, the high density of particular food plants fruiting during the long wet season, makes it possible for spider monkeys to forage in much larger sub groups, often containing two dominant females and ranging in size up to 9 individuals, using simultaneously about the same itineraries, but ex ploiting partly different food sources. As a result. during this season intragroup social interactions are more frequent. During the following long dry season. when nutritious fruits are scarce and some years even a severe food shortage may exist, the mean subgroup size decreases strongly. in particular effectuated so by the splitting of dominant-female core areas, which show almost no overlap anymore. Non-dominant females and males still may join subgroups led by a dominant female to share ecological knowledge of food sources. but they do so less frequently. Day ranges drop strikingly and the animals are more silent, both factors contributing to the lower chance of encounter. Activity budgets are decreased, in particular in males and non-dominant females. The better knowledge of available food in dominant females may favour them especially during the long dry season. This may be a reason that dominant females seem more successful in rearing offspring than non-dominant females, and perhaps that mortality in adult males seems higher considering the sex ratio. At the end of the long dry season. when preferred fruit in still low in supply, the relatively frequent feeding on flush leaves and flowers. again, sustains foraging in larger subgroups, because of the great amount of food offered at the same time and by mostly large-crowned, flushing or blooming food plants. Adult males do have core areas, which are larger than dominant-female core areas and even may, combine those of two dominant females. They cooperate in territorial defense patrols and long distance agonism in case of boundary conflicts. In this way, spider-monkey males seem to be able to defend wore females than they should in a social system with cohesive bisexual groups, like in many other primates. Spider-monkey social system in unusual among primates and only shown striking similarities with that of the chimpanzee (Pantroglodytes). Both species are largely frugivorous, and show a loose, unstable social structure within distinguishable groups. Subgroup size varies seasonally in relation to food supply and most commonly is small. Individual adults occupy 'core areas' and show capacity for and continual use of a detailed, high developed spatial memory. Also dominance behaviour and sexual behaviour show remarkable similarities between both species. 7. The annual home range of the spider-monkey study group in the Voltzberg study area covered 255 hectares, of which 220 hectares offered suitable habitat, Day range size ranged between 500 and 5. 000 meters, depending on the subgroup size and composition, the weather, the season and the distribution of particular important food sources. In the Voltzberg region, Atelesp. paniscus occurs at a density of 7, 1 individuals per km 2 , or 8. 2 individuals per km 2 when only suitable habitat is considered. Biomass is ranging between 0. 4 and 0. 5 kg/ha, depending on the home range figure choosen. Ateles does not show polyspecific associations with other sympatric primate species. Some short-term associations observed were due to chance or should probably be regarded as companionship. Associations with terrestrial birds and mammals, however, are frequently observed and way be advantageous for one or both of the participant species. The terrestrial animals focus on the noisy foraging spider monkeys to obtain nutritious fruits and/or seeds immediately after dropping, while alarm calls emitted by fleeing terrestrial animals way benefit the spider monkeys, warning them against possible intruders coming into the area. 8. Spider monkeys are extremely vulnerable to hunting and habitat destruction. All over their range they disappear in the face of human entrance. showing little or no adaptability to human intrusion. Emphasizing the important role of specialized frugivores, like spider monkeys, an dispersal agents for many rain forest plants, and the balance between seed disperser. and seed- and seedling predators as they interact with fruits. having a strong impact on structure and composition of primeval tropical rain forest. a suggestion is made to combine interests of both conservationists and exploiters of rain forest treasures in conservational projects, like that of a responsible exploiting of buffer zones surrounding national parks and nature reserves, by increasing density of particular commercially valuable and edible fruit producing trees, and sustaining restricted game cropping of terrestrial seed predators and herbivores, like agoutis, acouchis, peccaries, deer and tapirs...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{techniques}} of {{electron paramagnetic resonance}} (E. P. R.) {{have been used to}} investigate the interaction of rare earth ions with (a) their crystalline environment, by measuring their effective g tensor, and, (b) each other, by observing their pair spectra. The experiments have been carried out in host lattices which, when magnetically concentrated, show interesting ordering properties. The Apparatus Measurements have been made at both X and K Band frequencies. The X Band spectrometer, originally constructed by Drs. A. H. Cooke and J. G. Park, was modified by the addition of a 115 Ke/s, and 50 c/s, phase sensitive detection system to give greater sensitivity. The K Band spectrometer was designed with a tuneable cylindrical H 011 transmission cavity, and incorporated an improved system of cryogenics. E. P. R. of rare earth ions in diamagnetic garnets The investigation of the properties or rare earth ions la diamagnetic garnets is of importance in connection with their profound influence on the ferrimagnetism of the iron garnets (for example see Dillon et al. 1960). The results of Ryan (1960) on the E. P. R. of rare earth lone in yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG) and yttrium gallium garnet (YGG) have shown a considerable difference of their g tensor in the two lattices, particularly for the case of Kr 3 +. In order to investigate further this variation, in particular the dependence on the host ion in the rare earth site, measurements have been made of the g tensors in the lutetium garnets LAG and LGG. The results, obtained mainly at X Band and 4. 2 °K, are given in Table 1 together with that for Dy 3 + in YAG where no resonance had previously been observed. They indicate that the variation between lutetium and yttrium lattices it not so great as that between the aluminium and gallium lattices. Table 1.

However, in two cases they have been used successfully. Dysprosium aluminium garnet orders antiferromagnetically at 2. 5 °K (Ball et al. 1962). The highly anisotropic g values found for Dy 3 + in YAG suggest that the ions in DyAG, which has a similar lattice constant, may be treated to a first approximation a Ising spins with g z = 18. 0, g x = g y = 0. Assuming only dipolar interaction a possible ordered state for such ions has been proposed, and the model allows an explanation of the main features of the susceptibility curve to be made. As the g values of Yb 3 + show relatively little variation with lattice, it la possible to use those found in the gallium garnets with some confidence for a discussion of YbIG. From the theory of Wolf (1962), canting of the rare earth sublattices at 20 ° to the Fe 3 + sublattice has been predicted, and the order of magnitude of the spontaneous moment at 0 Â°K accounted for. Discussion of the garnet g values, cubic approximation In order to make theoretical predictions of the g values other magnetically concentrated gamete a thorough understanding of the resonance results In terms of the local crystal field is required. As a first approximation this crystal field has been considered to arise mainly from the nearest eight oxygen neighbours, which are arranged {{in the form of a}} distorted cube about the rare earth site. Using the general cubic field calculations of Lea et al. (1962) it has been found that the gross features of the g values can be accounted for on such a model. But only in the case of Yb 3 + can the values be quantitatively explained to within a few percent. The trends in the observed g values for Nd 3 + and Yb 3 + have been found to follow closely those in the structure parameters describing the positions of the oxygen neighbours. From the Kr 3 + results an estimate has been made of the ratio of the parameters describing the crystal field, A 0 4 /A 0 6, and this has been compared with other estimates. The extremely anisotropic g values found for Dy 3 + in YAG suggest a ground state wavefunction of nearly pure |J Z = 15 / 2 >. (Where Z is the [001] crystal direction). Point charge calculations of the garnet crystal field A general account of the method of derivation of the crystal field parameters from a point charge model of the crystal lattice has been written. In conjunction with D. K. Ray, the validity of an ionic model of the crystal lattice has been tested by considering the case of PrCl 3. This indicated the inadequacies of the model, even when accents on neighbouring lane were considered, but suggested that calculated ratios of parameters may be a good approximation to the true values. Attaining a model of point charges only, a computer has been used to calculate the contributions from (a) nearest neighbours only, and (b) all the ions in the lattice, to the crystal field parameters A m n at the rare earth site in YAG, YGG, LAG, LGG and YIG. The results of these calculations have been discussed. They indicate quite large distortions from a cubic field, and that the parameters for YGG are likely to lie closest to those in YIG. A possible set of crystal field parameters for Yb 3 + in YGG The case of Yb 3 + in the garnets is best suited to a more detailed theoretical analysis. As there are insufficient experimental data available to enable all the parameters to be found from experiment alone, ratios calculated on the point charge model have been used to reduce the number of parameters to be fitted. Treating first the J = 5 / 2 multiplet by itself, and then the whole 2 F term, a set of parameters which give a fair agreement with experiment have been found using a computer programme. The discrepancies, which should be small, indicate the inadequacies of the approximations made. The wavefunction found for the lowest J = 5 / 2 doublet is similar to that found from perturbation theory, and in general the fit to the data for the J = 5 / 2 state alone is better than that to the whole 2 F term. E. P. R. of rare earth ions in weakly paramagnetic garnets. Interaction shift It has been shown that the resonance from Kramers ions in a lattice containing host ions in a singlet ground state should be shifted but not broadened by th&e interactions. This shift may be expressed in the same form as the magnetic g tensor. The effective principal g values of Yb 3 + and Er 3 + have been measured at X Band frequencies and 4. 2 °K in such lattices, end the results are given in Table 2. The case of Yb 3 + in TmAG is believed to allow unambiguously such an interaction shift. Table 2.

R. from pairs of Gd 3 + ions in LaCl 3 In order to obtain information on the interactions of a pair of Gd 3 + ions in LaCl 3 which is of interest in connection with the properties of the isostructural ionic ferromagnet GdCl 3, their pair spectrum has been investigated at X and K Band frequencies and at 20 °K. In such a case of weak isotropic exchange interaction it is possible to obtain measurements of the exchange constants directly from the resonance line position. The nearest neighbour (n. n.) pair spectrum, with the magnetic field H parallel to the c axis, is symmetric about the central main line and extends over ~ ± 2, 600 gauss. It consists of four outer groups of lines, of overall width ~ 130 gauss and separation ~ 370 gauss, and three apparently well resolved inner lines. The spectrum due to next nearest neighbour (n. n. n. } pairs, with H along their symmetry axis, shows no such grouping. There are very many lines within 600 gauss of the central main line, due to more distant neighbours. The theoretical analysis of the spectrum has been undertaken from the start using a computer. It has not been possible to identify any of the pair transitions with certainty, and because of the large variation of line position with the values of all five parameters in the pair Hamiltonian the interpretation has proved difficult. However if the crystal field parameters for a member of the n. n. pair are assumed not to differ considerably from those of the isolated ions, the grouping of the outer n. n. lines can be explained. It indicates a value of J ox = 0. 011 (± 0. 005) cm - 1 and α = g 2 μ 2 B /r 3 nn = 0. 022 (± 0. 002) cm - 1 (where &#x 210 b; ox = J ox s (1) ⋅ s (2)). E. P. R. of rare earth atoms in YCl 3 and LuCl 3 The principal g values of rare earth lone in YCl 3 and LuCl 3 have been measured at X Band frequencies and 4. 2 °K. The results are listed in Table 4. The cases of Py 3 +, Er 3 +, and Yb 3 + show little relative variation with host lattice, and it should be possible to use the values directly for the interpretation of the bulk magnetic properties of the isostructural concentrated compounds. It has been shown that as a first approximation, the crystal field at the rare earth site may be considered to be sixfold cubic, as expected from the location of th nearest Cl - ions. Table 4.
