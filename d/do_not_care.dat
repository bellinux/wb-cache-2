5|$|In the morning, Marge {{gets the}} family {{together}} to discuss romance, but they can only come up with vignettes from their failed relationships {{in the form of}} clips from previous episodes. Homer, however, saves the day when he brings up how he and Marge got together. Ultimately, the kids <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>care</b> for this one and wind up watching Itchy & Scratchy while Homer and Marge share a moment together.|$|E
5|$|Khal Drogo's khalasar {{arrives at}} the city of Vaes Dothrak. Viserys Targaryen impatiently waits for the army Drogo agreed to lend him, the bride price offered for his sister Daenerys, to reconquer the Seven Kingdoms. When Viserys misinterprets Daenerys's {{invitation}} to dinner as an order, he becomes angry and strikes her. For the first time, Daenerys fights back, hitting her astounded brother and promising that if he raises a hand against her again, his hands will be cut off. Later, the banished knight Jorah Mormont tells her that Viserys {{would not be a}} good leader for the invasion of Westeros and, despite what Viserys believes, the people of the Seven Kingdoms <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>care</b> who rules them {{as long as they are}} ruled well. Daenerys agrees that Viserys could not conquer the Seven Kingdoms even if Khal Drogo gave him an entire army.|$|E

He called them rubbish, and cannot tell one from another, and thinks it is {{superior}} to feel like that. He <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>care</b> for me, he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>care</b> for flowers, he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>care</b> for the painted sky at eventide--is there anything he does care for, except building shacks to coop himself up in from the good clean rain, and thumping the melons, and sampling the grapes, and fingering the fruit on the trees, to see how those properties are coming along? ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{principle}} of interdependence {{is also very}} important in Jainism. This states that all of nature is bound together, and that [...] "if one <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>care</b> for nature one <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>care</b> for oneself.".|$|R

25|$|Nick Offerman as Ron Swanson, {{the parks}} and {{recreation}} director who, as a libertarian, believes in as small a government as possible. As such, Ron strives to make his department as ineffective as possible, and favors hiring employees who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>care</b> about their jobs or are poor at them. Nevertheless, Ron consistently demonstrates that he secretly cares deeply about his fellow co-workers.|$|E
25|$|Whether Adam is the personage that {{we should}} {{consider}} Our Heavenly Father, or not, is considerable of a mystery to a good many. I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>care</b> for one moment how that is; it is no matter whether we are to consider Him our God, or whether His Father, or his Grandfather, for in either case we are of one species of one family and Jesus Christ is also of our species.|$|E

He prosecuted cases at all levels, including youth and provincial courts {{as well as}} the Supreme Court of Canada. MacKay has publicly stated that the major impetus for his entry into federal politics was his frustrations with the shortcomings in the justice system, particularly his perception that the courts <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>care</b> about the impact crime has on victims.|$|E
25|$|Some slave {{devices are}} {{designed}} to ignore any SPI communications in which the number of clock pulses is greater than specified. Others <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>care,</b> ignoring extra inputs and continuing to shift the same output bit. It is common for different devices to use SPI communications with different lengths, as, for example, when SPI is used to access the scan chain of a digital IC by issuing a command word of one size (perhaps 32 bits) and then getting a response of a different size (perhaps 153 bits, one for each pin in that scan chain).|$|E
25|$|As {{far back}} as the 1960s, the footballing rivalry between England and Germany has been {{considered}} mainly an English phenomenon; this has been observed by several commentators of both English and German origin. In June 2009, British comedian Stephen Fry stated on the BBC show QI that, unlike the English, German football fans <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>care</b> about their team's loss at the 1966 World Cup final and may not even remember that they had made it that far. Instead, German fans consider their rivalry with the Netherlands to be their traditional footballing rivalry and care more about the matches against them, such as the 1974 FIFA World Cup final.|$|E

25|$|The Anglo-Saxon {{perspective}} in the fiction at times {{can be much}} less successful in a European market. Although Italy is the strongest foreign market for the chick lit sold by single-title imprint Red Dress Ink, in that country romance readers <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>care</b> to read books about cowboys, as this type of occupation was not common in their culture. The paranormal romance genre is not popular {{in countries such as}} Poland and Russia, although historical romance tends to be very successful. Inspirational romance does not sell well in Europe, where romances that feature babies are very popular. German readers enjoy reading more erotic romance novels, and some German translations of English romance novels expand or insert love scenes into otherwise tame stories. The alternate scenario also occurs, as other German translators censor the love scenes.|$|E
500|$|Regarding {{the accusations}} leveled towards Iðunn by Loki, Lee Hollander opines that Lokasenna was {{intended}} to be humorous and that the accusations thrown by Loki in the poem are not necessarily to be taken as [...] "generally accepted lore" [...] {{at the time it was}} composed. Rather they are charges that are easy for Loki to make and difficult for his targets to disprove, or which they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>care</b> to refute.|$|E
500|$|Eight years later, Dr. B. Brookes Lee {{was arrested}} in Portland, Oregon. He {{had been accused of}} {{treating}} Sharkey to make it appear that he had been fouled by Fitzsimmons. Lee admitted it was true. [...] "I fixed Sharkey up to look {{as if he had been}} fouled. How? Well, that is something I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>care</b> to reveal, but I will assert that it was done—that is enough. There is no doubt that Fitzsimmons was entitled to the decision and did not foul Sharkey. I got $1,000 for my part in the affair." ...|$|E

500|$|Robinson's {{promotion}} met {{a generally}} positive, although mixed, reception among newspapers and white major league players. However, racial tension {{existed in the}} Dodger clubhouse. Some Dodger players insinuated they would sit out rather than play alongside Robinson. The brewing mutiny ended when Dodgers management took a stand for Robinson. Manager Leo Durocher informed the team, [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>care</b> if the guy is yellow or black, or if he has stripes like a fuckin' zebra. I'm the manager of this team, and I say he plays. What's more, I say he can make us all rich. And {{if any of you}} cannot use the money, I will see that you are all traded." ...|$|E
500|$|The Rules of the Game premiered on Friday, July 7, 1939, at the Colisée Theatre in Paris to a {{full house}} and later at the Aubert Palace also in Paris. It was shown on a double billing with a {{patriotic}} documentary about French history. The audience at the screening consisted {{of members of the}} right-wing organisations, who booed after a while into the screening; Paulette Dubost said people at the screening fought and one person tried to set fire to the theatre. Renoir said he [...] "depicted pleasant, sympathetic characters, but showed them in a society in the process of disintegration, so that they were defeated at the onset... the audience recognized this. The truth is that they recognized themselves. People who commit suicide <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>care</b> to do it in front of witnesses." ...|$|E
500|$|Barbara Hatley {{notes that}} Saman {{contrasts}} the perceived differences between Eastern and Western cultures. She cites {{the scene where}} Shakuntala fantasizes encountering a [...] "foreign demon" [...] (European explorer) while bathing, later [...] "embracing" [...] him and discussing the [...] "bizarre" [...] requirement that Asian men are required to wear penis decorations and the [...] "crassness" [...] of Europeans who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>care</b> about virginity, wear bikinis in public, and show sex on television. According to Hatley, this is rendered more ironic by both characters being naked during the discussion. She also notes that Saman touches on the traditional archetype of feminine power drawn from nature and the supernatural, and it reinterprets the hero archetype through Saman, who is small, thin, and inexperienced with women but able to withstand torture and defend a community of rubber tappers.|$|E

500|$|Pratchett {{believed}} he owed [...] "a {{debt to the}} science fiction/fantasy genre which he grew up out of" [...] and disliked the term [...] "magical realism" [...] which, he said, is [...] "like a polite way of saying you write fantasy and is more acceptable to certain people ... who, on the whole, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>care</b> that much." [...] He expressed annoyance that fantasy is [...] "unregarded as a literary form", arguing that it [...] "is the oldest form of fiction"; he described himself as [...] "infuriated" [...] when novels containing science fiction or fantasy ideas were not regarded as part of those genres. He debated this issue with novelist A. S. Byatt and critic Terry Eagleton, arguing that fantasy is fundamental {{to the way we}} understand the world and therefore an integral aspect of all fiction.|$|E
500|$|Du Bois {{frequently}} promoted African-American artistic {{creativity in}} his writings, {{and when the}} Harlem Renaissance emerged in the mid-1920s, his article [...] "A Negro Art Renaissance" [...] celebrated {{the end of the}} long hiatus of blacks from creative endeavors.Horne, Malika, [...] "Art and Artists", in Young, pp. 13–15.Lewis, p. 475 (article). His enthusiasm for the Harlem Renaissance waned as he came to believe that many whites visited Harlem for voyeurism, not for genuine appreciation of black art.Lewis, p. 480. Du Bois insisted that artists recognize their moral responsibilities, writing that [...] "a black artist is first of all a black artist." [...] He was also concerned that black artists were not using their art to promote black causes, saying [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>care</b> a damn for any art that is not used for propaganda." [...] By the end of 1926, he stopped employing The Crisis to support the arts.|$|E
500|$|After {{seeing a}} {{commercial}} about starving children in Africa, Cartman, Stan, Kenny and Kyle send money to Sally Struthers' charity organization, the Christian Children's Fund. They <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>care</b> about the cause, but want the free sports watch {{that comes with}} the sponsorship. However, due to a miscommunication, an Ethiopian boy is delivered to the boys instead of the watch. Although initially shocked, the four boys befriend him, and Cartman names the boy Starvin' Marvin ("Marvin" [...] being given to him by the apparent pronunciation of the name when he was talking in his native language). Meanwhile, mobs of wild turkeys begin attacking and killing South Park residents. Mad scientist Dr. Mephisto tries to warn Mayor McDaniels that genetically engineered turkeys he had been breeding to feed to the poor have gone crazy and are now attacking humans. Mephisto is instead ignored and ridiculed by McDaniels.|$|E
