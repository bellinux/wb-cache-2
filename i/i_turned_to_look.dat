500|$|O'Neill Surber {{explored}} {{the lyrics of}} Pink Floyd and declared the issue of non-being a common theme in their music. Waters invoked non-being or non-existence in The Wall, with the lyrics to [...] "Comfortably Numb": [...] "I caught a fleeting glimpse, {{out of the corner}} of my eye. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look,</b> but it was gone, I cannot put my finger on it now, the child is grown, the dream is gone." [...] Barrett referred to non-being in his final contribution to the band's catalogue, [...] "Jugband Blues": [...] "I'm most obliged to you for making it clear that I'm not here." ...|$|E
60|$|Shrilly and {{suddenly}} the words rang in my ears, and, more startled than I cared to show, <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for the speaker.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at my companion. He had {{repeated}} the name very softly, yet with a peculiar intonation, {{which made me}} at once aware that the name was of interest to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{they are}} all burning," [...] <b>I</b> said, <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the fleet, each craft of which {{appeared}} to be enveloped in flames.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> {{immediately}} <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at Jack, who {{was sitting}} up in {{the spot where he}} had passed the night, with a sleepy smile on his countenance.|$|R
60|$|I {{went and}} when <b>I</b> reached them, <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> my last on her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{caught a}} cold," [...] the Thing replies, [...] "Out there upon the landing." [...] <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> in some surprise, And there, before my very eyes, A little Ghost was standing! ...|$|E
60|$|The mighty slap he {{gave his}} wretched {{forehead}} was very loud, too. But when <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at him {{he was no longer}} there. He had rushed away somewhere out of sight. This sudden disappearance made me laugh.|$|E
60|$|Soft {{though her}} voice was, there was passion quivering in every sentence. When <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at her, {{her eyes and}} face seemed aflame with it. The color had {{streamed}} into her cheeks, she had drifted into my arms, and her clinging lips yielded unresistingly to mine.|$|E
60|$|I walked {{rapidly to}} the gate. When {{challenged}} by the sentinel, <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> summon my instructor. He was nowhere visible. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> again <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the prison. Nothing was there: desolate and forbidding, as about the broken statue of Ozymandias.|$|R
5000|$|Guys {{were about}} to shoot these people. I yelled, 'hold it', and shot my picture. As I walked away, I heard M16s open up. From {{the corner of my}} eye I saw bodies falling, but <b>I</b> didn't <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>look.</b>|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> now <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the [...] "boy," [...] who {{was sitting}} on his pony with both eyes nearly shut, and a smile so wide that the double row of his teeth {{were exposed to the}} very last grinders! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Prince. Therefore take it {{and hide}} it in the safest and most secret place in the palace, and with it these pearls that are too priceless to be flaunted about the streets of Memphis at night, unless indeed----" [...] and <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for Amada, but she was gone.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{at the old}} man, {{who was in the}} rear, {{marching in}} good order, and acting as if on some {{pleasure}} excursion which he hoped would not come to an end too soon. It shamed me to see him so jolly when I was feeling so sore.|$|E
60|$|Something in {{his tone}} caught my ear, and <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at him. An {{extraordinary}} change had come over his face. It was writhing with inward merriment. His two eyes were shining like stars. It {{seemed to me that}} he was making desperate efforts to restrain a convulsive attack of laughter.|$|E
60|$|But in {{that moment}} I remembered something, and <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> aside <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for my friend Rinolfo. He was moving stealthily away, {{following}} the road Luisina had taken. The conviction {{that he went to}} plague and jeer at her, to exult over her expulsion from Mondolfo, kindled my anger all anew.|$|R
60|$|He {{was evidently}} someone of {{account in the}} household, for {{he stood on the}} {{hearthrug}} with his hands thrust into his loose pockets, completely at his ease, and without making any apology for his unceremonious appearance. When <b>I</b> first <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at him he was examining me with a cold, critical stare, which made me feel uncomfortable without knowing why.|$|R
60|$|She heard him, {{before he}} could take her by surprise, and slip the bandage over her eyes. The moment when <b>I</b> <b>turned,</b> horror-struck, <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at Oscar, was also the moment when {{she lifted her head}} from Nugent's bosom <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for the surgeon. Her eyes {{followed}} the direction taken by mine. They encountered Oscar's face. She saw the blue-black hue of it in full light.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certain death!" [...] {{he shouted}} back, and was gone. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at Montgomery and his wife. She let her {{umbrella}} fall {{and he had}} turned white. [...] "Of course, {{there is nothing to}} be alarmed about," [...] I said, in a reassuring way. [...] "Montgomery has taken half an inch scores of times; you say it always cured you." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{the first}} {{sound of her}} sweet voice, <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the speaker. She was a girl, perhaps {{a year or two}} younger than myself, very slender and graceful, and with eyes like a mother's. She wasn't exactly pretty, but her face was so full of {{intelligence}} and expression that it was worth a great deal more than any doll-like prettiness.|$|E
6000|$|I {{found out}} {{early the next}} summer. I was strolling through the long {{corridors}} of a certain great department, when I came upon a man accurately yoked across the shoulders, and supporting two huge pails of ice on either side, from which he was replenishing the pitchers in the various offices. As I passed <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at him again. It was Dobbs! ...|$|E
60|$|L. Neith did {{not wait}} {{to hear what he}} would say. When <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> back <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at her, she was gone; and I only saw the level white cloud form itself again, close to the arch of the sun as it sank. And as the last edge of the sun disappeared, the form of Pthah faded into a mighty shadow, and so passed away.|$|R
60|$|The Duke drew away, {{and leaned}} upon {{the arm of}} Cosimo, watching. Behind me in the gallery I heard a rustle of {{feminine}} gowns; but <b>I</b> did not <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>look.</b> My eyes were upon the stern sable figure of the familiar.|$|R
6000|$|At {{that moment}} the thought of Jack's amputated leg came into my head. [...] "That will prove it," [...] thought <b>I,</b> and <b>turned</b> quickly <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at my friend. One glance was sufficient--a wooden stump {{occupied}} the place of his right leg. I groaned aloud and burst into tears.|$|R
6000|$|As this {{question}} was asked, <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> my {{friend in the}} face, and I found that his handsome, smooth, fair Dutch lineaments were covered with a glow of red, {{that it was not}} usual to see extended so far from his ruddy cheeks. Dirck {{was too much of a}} man, however, to turn away, or to try to hide blushes so ingenuous; but he answered stoutly-- ...|$|E
60|$|Delcarte we {{had left}} {{in charge of the}} boat; but Snider and Taylor were with me, and {{following}} my example, each engaged in the fascinating sport of prospecting for antiques. Each of us uncovered a great number of these bricks, until we commenced to weary of the monotony of it, when Snider suddenly gave an exclamation of excitement, and, as <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look,</b> he held up a human skull for my inspection.|$|E
60|$|Without another word, {{she left}} me. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for Philip, {{and saw that}} my sister had joined him while I had been {{speaking}} to Miss Jillgall. It pleased me to find that they were talking in a friendly way when I joined them. A quarrel between Helena and my husband that is to be--no, my husband that shall be--would have been too distressing, too unnatural I might almost call it.|$|E
60|$|In {{an instant}} I saw that by attacking the Okarians {{from the rear}} I could so quickly disorganize them that their further {{resistance}} would be short-lived, and with this idea in mind I sprang from the dais, casting a word of explanation to Dejah Thoris over my shoulder, though <b>I</b> did not <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at her.|$|R
60|$|I {{heard him}} breathe a wistful hollow sigh. Very ancient and dim he seemed {{as he stood}} beside me. But <b>I</b> did not <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> upon him. <b>I</b> had no need to. I knew his form, in the inner and clearer sight of things, as well as every human being knows by innate instinct, the Unseen face and form of Father Time.|$|R
6000|$|Here <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> my head <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at Hans, {{proposing to}} smite him with words, or physically, since {{to have this}} Mameena myth, of which I have {{detailed}} the origin in the book called Child of Storm, re-arise out of his hideous little mouth was too much. But before I could get out a syllable {{he held up his}} finger and whispered, ...|$|R
60|$|Without a word {{or change}} in her {{expression}} she left me, went into the house, {{and closed the door}} behind her. I did not wish to make a scene, which would give rise to injurious gossip, and therefore walked away, though as I did so <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> in at the open window, but I did not see Sylvia; I only saw the bandaged face of Sister Agatha looking out at me, more mournful than before.|$|E
60|$|Then, I {{felt as if}} a light were {{shining on}} me from the other side. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look,</b> {{and there was the}} woman from the hills beckoning me away to ascend with her towards the bright clouds above. Her arm, as she held it forth, shone fair, even against the fair hills; and from her outstretched hand came long thin rays of {{trembling}} light, which penetrated to where I stood, cooling and calming wherever they touched me.|$|E
60|$|I {{pressed my}} {{wainscot}} bell. After an unusual delay in a drastically regulated household, {{the door behind}} me gently opened. I began simpering directions over my shoulder in the Percy way with servants--and presently realized that all was not quite as it should be. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look,</b> and saw thrust in at the doorway an apparently bodiless, protuberant head, with black, buttony eyes on either side a long, long nose. Then the remainder of this figure squeezed reluctantly in. It was Adam Waggett.|$|E
60|$|All was inexplicable. There {{was really}} the smell of meat. I had also that {{peculiar}} sensation of fulness which is apt to succeed a dinner, and a dish well filled with bones was in plain view. I took {{up one of the}} latter, in order to ascertain its genus. The captain kindly informed me that it was the remains of a pig, which had cost him a great deal of trouble to obtain, as the French viewed the act of eating a pig as very little less heinous than the act of eating a child. Suspicions began to trouble me, and <b>I</b> now <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for the head and reproachful eye of the brigadier.|$|R
6000|$|... "My hound Ajax was a dear {{companion}} {{to me in}} this old castle, although I never took him in my walks, as he was apt to get into mischief, and when <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> my head <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at him he was gone; but strange to say, the hand which had been stroking the dog {{felt as if it}} were still resting on his neck.|$|R
60|$|And in {{the country}} I passed through long fields of golden corn, which reached as far as I could see; I remembered the spring, when {{it had all been}} new, soft, fresh, green. And {{presently}} <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> round <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at Seville in the distance, bathed in brilliant light, glowing as though its walls were built of yellow flame. The Giralda arose in its wonderful grace like an arrow; so slim, so comely, it reminded one of an Arab youth, with long, thin limbs. With the setting sun, gradually the city turned rosy-red and seemed to lose all substantiality, till it became a many-shaped mist that was dissolved in the tenderness of the sky.|$|R
