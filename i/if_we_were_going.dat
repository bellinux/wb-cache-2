500|$|Chester Bennington {{stated in}} an {{interview}} with MTV News, which referred to Linkin Park's new style as being less technical and more organic: [...] "When it came to doing things that felt very much like older Linkin Park, like mixing hip-hop with a rock chorus, [...] felt like, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to do it, we need to really {{do it in a way}} that felt natural and felt original and felt like it was something we hadn't done in the past... there are hip-hop songs on the album—'Wretches and Kings', 'When They Come for Me'—they're like nothing the band have tried before: snarling, raw, dark and...strangely organic." ...|$|E
500|$|In early 1965, Caesar and Cleo {{began calling}} {{themselves}} Sonny & Cher. Following {{the recording of}} [...] "I Got You Babe", they traveled to England in July 1965 at the Rolling Stones' advice; Cher recalled, [...] " [...] had told us... that Americans just didn't get us and that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to make it big, {{we were going to}} have to go to England." [...] According to writer Cintra Wilson, [...] "English newspaper photographers showed up when S were thrown out of the London Hilton [...] the night they arrived—literally overnight, they were stars. London went gaga for the heretofore-unseen S look, which was neither mod nor rocker." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{filming the}} {{underwater}} shots, Cameron began writing the screenplay. He wanted {{to honor the}} people who died during the sinking, so he spent six months researching all of the Titanics crew and passengers. [...] "I read everything I could. I created an extremely detailed timeline of the ship's few days and a very detailed timeline of the last night of its life," [...] he said. [...] "And I worked within that to write the script, and I got some historical experts to analyze what I'd written and comment on it, and I adjusted it." [...] He paid meticulous attention to detail, even including a scene depicting the Californians role in Titanic demise, though this was later cut (see below). From the beginning of the shoot, they had [...] "a very clear picture" [...] of what happened on the ship that night. [...] "I had a library that filled one whole wall of my writing office with Titanic stuff, because I wanted it to be right, especially <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to dive to the ship," [...] he said. [...] "That set the bar higher in a way – it elevated the movie in a sense. We wanted this to be a definitive visualization of this moment in history as if you'd gone back in a time machine and shot it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> {{to cross}} this evening, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to cross at all," [...] Pierre Leroux said. [...] "It is cold enough now, but <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> {{to pass the}} night here, it will be bitter." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a February 2016 {{interview}} he said, [...] "Let's not be kidding ourselves {{about what the}} stakes <b>are</b> here: <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to bring peace, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to reconcile nations, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to secure countries and communities, particularly minorities, particularly people who <b>are</b> persecuted, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> {{to have to make}} an unprecedented effort," [...] Gallagher speaking specifically of the crisis in Syria and Iraq, where so-called Islamic State militants have captured large swaths of territory and driven out tens of thousands of Christians and members of other minority groups, Gallagher said he is hopeful for a resolution of the conflict".|$|R

500|$|The {{sessions}} were particularly difficult for DeLonge, who suffered chronic back pain. [...] "When your back is killing {{you and you}} have to have surgery and all this stuff, it's just kind of hard to keep a focus on the happier times in your life," [...] he told MTV News. [...] "You end up writing all these songs about feeling sad and confused." [...] He often could only stand and sing for five minutes at a time before having to lay down again. Journalist Joe Shooman writes that the album followed a DIY spirit, rather than spending [...] "months and months refining and polishing everything for a major label and international pop market." [...] DeLonge intended to pay for the project himself, but when an A representative heard four unfinished songs, MCA—the record label Blink-182 was on—wanted to finance the album. DeLonge's manager convinced him it would be a bad idea to pass up someone else paying for its distribution. According to Boukas, an MCA representative dropped in on the sessions and was pleased with what he heard. [...] "When we wrote this album, we didn't know if it was going to be on a label or <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to put it out ourselves," [...] Barker said at the time. [...] "Once MCA jumped on board, it was kind of like, [...] "Whatever! That's cool. Cheers! Put it out, we don't really care!" ...|$|E
500|$|Another major {{breakthrough}} was developing the plot twist that Prince Hans would be revealed as the film's true villain only near the end. Hans {{was not even}} in the earliest drafts, then at first was not a villain, and after becoming one, was revealed to be evil much earlier in the plot. Del Vecho said, [...] "We realized [...] was most important [...] <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to make the ending so surprising you had to believe at one point that Hans was the answer... he's not the answer, it's Kristoff... f you can get the audience to leap ahead and think they have figured it out you can surprise them by turning it the other way." [...] Lee acknowledged that Hans was written as [...] "sociopathic" [...] and [...] "twisted" [...] throughout the final version. For example, Hans mirrors the behavior of the other characters: [...] "He mirrors [...] and he's goofy with her... he Duke [...] is a jerk, so he's a jerk back. And with Elsa he's a hero." [...] It was difficult to lay the foundation for Anna's belated turn to Kristoff without also making Hans' betrayal of Anna too predictable, in that the audience had to [...] "feel... her feeling something but not quite understanding it... Because the minute it is [...] it deflated." [...] At one point, Anna openly flirted with Kristoff upon first meeting him, but that was changed after Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn pointed out that it would confuse and annoy viewers since Anna was already engaged to Hans.|$|E
2500|$|... "It was {{certainly}} {{difficult for us}} to come to the decision that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to be economically viable we had to move", club President Larry Breskin said. [...] "If we could {{have found a way to}} stay in Detroit, we would have." ...|$|E

2500|$|DiMedio responded: [...] here is {{absolutely}} no way that the District Tech {{people are going to}} monitor students at home.... <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to monitor student use at home, we would have stated so. Think about it—why would we do that? There is no purpose. We are not a police state.... There is no way that I would approve or advocate for the monitoring of students at home.I suggest you take a breath and relax.|$|E
2500|$|The {{windows were}} {{installed}} in 1953 after lobbying from the Daughters of the Confederacy. The {{dean of the}} cathedral, the Very Rev. Gary Hall, stated that the Charleston church shooting was the catalyst for the planned removal, saying [...] "It {{seemed to me that}} we couldn't, with credibility, address the race agenda <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to keep the windows in there." [...] In 2017, however, the windows remained in place. On September 6, 2017, workmen were removing them.|$|E
2500|$|During 2011, {{the tournament}} {{expanded}} to 68 teams. Four [...] "play-in" [...] games are now played, officially {{known as the}} [...] "First Four". However, the teams playing in the First Four are not automatically seeded #16; their seeding {{is determined by the}} committee on Selection Sunday. Explaining the reasoning for this format, selection committee chairman Dan Guerrero said, [...] "We felt <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to expand the field it would create better drama for the tournament if the First Four was much more exciting. They could all be on the 10 line or the 12 line or the 11 line." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{he wants}} {{some of the}} conceit knocked out of him," [...] added Stanley. [...] "But come on, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> for a walk, let us get started." ...|$|R

2500|$|We {{were at the}} end of our {{recording}} {{contract with}} Century Media, and basically they didn't know <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to re-sign with them, so they gave us a very small budget for our last album to work with. That was about $20,000 which is a nothing deal to do a record. What we needed to do at the time was to find a producer that was immediately available to make a record with such a small budget, and that guy was Kelly Gray (laughs). Unfortunately, he was just not the right guy to do this album." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vig {{stated that}} the band had no initial plans to tour as [...] "not going on the road would really free us up to record tons of stuff". As the band members {{realized}} [...] "that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to have a successful record we'd {{have to go out}} on tour and promote it", and enjoyed playing live to record the [...] "Vow" [...] video, they decided to perform to audiences as well. To perform the complex and layered tracks live, the band hired Los Angeles bass player Daniel Shulman for the tour, and figured out ways to trigger samples on stage, such as having Marker play a keyboard along with his guitar.|$|E
2500|$|Boat 8 {{was loaded}} with 28 people under the {{supervision}} of Second Officer Lightoller and launched at about 1:00a.m., with Captain Smith and Chief Officer Wilde participating. Boat 8 was the first lifeboat on the port side to be lowered. Ida Straus, wife of New York merchant Isidor Straus, was asked to join a group of people preparing to board but refused, saying, [...] "I will not be separated from my husband. As we have lived, so will we die– together." [...] The 67-year-old Isidor likewise refused an offer to board on account of his age, saying: [...] "I do not wish any distinction in my favor which is not granted to others." [...] They were last seen alive on deck arm in arm. Major Archibald Butt, military aide to US President William Howard Taft, escorted to the boat Marie Young, a former music teacher to the children of President Theodore Roosevelt. She later recalled he [...] "wrapped blankets about me and tucked me in as carefully as <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> on a motor ride." [...] He wished her farewell and good luck, asking her to [...] "remember me to the folks back home." [...] Other single women were brought to the boats by men who had earlier offered their services to [...] "unprotected ladies," [...] as the conventions of the era dictated.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to shut {{our ears}} to {{criticism}} we'd better give up being clergymen," [...] he answered. [...] "I'm afraid {{there is a}} great deal of truth in what you said." ...|$|R
6000|$|I told him, and he said: [...] "Oh yes. Well, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to {{restrict}} immigration, I suppose we sha'n't see many more Altrurians, and we'd better {{make the most}} of this one. Heigh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' he said. 'It isn't that. Only--if <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to {{know each}} other, we must pledge {{ourselves}} for ever. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to make a relationship, even of friendship, {{there must be something}} final and infallible about it.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Now {{continuing}} their {{career as a}} trio, with Ihsahn handling keyboards, vocals, guitars and bass, the band recorded their third album IX Equilibrium and toured Europe and North America. It was around 2000 when Samoth and Trym started to gravitate more towards death metal, while Ihsahn directed his musical exploration towards his side project, Peccatum. Thus, in 2001, Emperor decided to disband after releasing one final album, , composed entirely by Ihsahn. [...] Ihsahn later recalled that [...] "When we announced the split up in 2001, we didn't think we would do anything more with Emperor ever again...The decision was also based on the feeling that Emperor {{had a lot of}} integrity, and that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to end it, we should end it while we still created great music. [...] For us, the decision was made in the black metal spirit. Since Samoth and I pulled in different directions, we didn't see any point in continuing. [...] The core of the band wasn't intact anymore". Samoth echoed Ihsahn's position: [...] "At that point, we both had other priorities that we wanted to pursue and we both felt that splitting up Emperor was the best thing to do. [...] We really wanted to focus on other things, and felt it was the only right thing to do".|$|E
2500|$|Associate Creative Consultant Donna Lettow {{says about}} Darius' {{character}} development, [...] "It was always planned that Darius would die in [...] "The Hunters". The original plan for Darius {{was that he}} would reappear in flashbacks, much like Fitzcairn does now." [...] Stocker's illness in early 1993 prevented this. Panzer remembers that Stocker [...] "had announced that he had a brain tumor." [...] The season 1 promotional booklet recounts, [...] "Just days before going into production [...] actor Werner Stocker was stricken ill and was unable to work. By now the character of Darius had {{become an integral part of}} the story and the writers had to scramble to adjust the story line." [...] Abramowitz recalls, [...] "I got a call at three o'clock in the morning, saying Werner would not be available, we were shooting in a day and a half, and there was fear <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to have to shut down. I went into work, wrote twenty-five straight hours, without a break, and got out a script and the show went on and it turned out pretty well." [...] This script bears the date March 15, 1993. The production crew, too, had to adapt to the situation. The promotional booklet reports, [...] "Footage from previous episodes was successfully used to fill in for the absent actor." [...] Stocker died on May 27, 1993. The episodes [...] "" [...] and [...] "" [...] are dedicated to him.|$|E
2500|$|The next day, juror number three—Jennifer Ford, a 32-year-old nursing student—told ABC News, [...] "I {{did not say}} she was innocent" [...] and [...] "I {{just said}} {{there was not enough}} evidence. If you cannot prove what the crime was, you cannot {{determine}} what the punishment should be." [...] She added, [...] "I'm not saying that I believe the defense," [...] but that [...] "it's easier for me logically to get from point A to point B" [...] via the defense argument, as opposed to the prosecution argument. Ford believed George Anthony was [...] "dishonest." [...] She said the jury [...] "was sick to [...] stomachs to get [...] verdict" [...] and that the decision process overwhelmed them {{to the point where they}} did not want to talk to reporters afterwards. Juror number two, a 46-year-old male who requested to stay unidentified, told the St. Petersburg Times that [...] "everybody agreed <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> fully on feelings and emotions, [...] was done". He stated that a lack of evidence was the reason for the not-guilty verdict: [...] "I just swear to God... I wish we had more evidence to put her away. I truly do... But it wasn't there." [...] He also said that Anthony was [...] "not a good person in my opinion". Juror number six, identified by WTSP as Brian Berling, told gossip website TMZ.com that he was willing to be interviewed [...] "so long as the opportunities are paid".|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked whether}} the series would feel as [...] "adult" [...] as Jessica Jones, Colter replied, [...] "if you think Jessica is adult then we’re still keeping up with that pace ... we’ll {{continue}} along those lines of PG-16+". On whether Luke Cage would address current race issues, including Black Lives Matter, given the character's past (a wrongfully imprisoned black man), Colter said, [...] "this {{is not necessarily the}} platform to hit it head on" [...] but [...] "the things that he's going through will ring true {{for a lot of people}} in law enforcement" [...] and on the street. Loeb said on the issue, [...] "Luke Cage, when he came on the scene in the early 70s was for all intents and purposes the first black superhero. Given what’s going on present day, it just resonates." [...] Coker stated that Cage is [...] "someone that the community can touch and go to", adding, [...] "There’s never been a time in history where having a bulletproof black man" [...] has been so important. Luke Cage was also the first MCU property to use the word [...] "nigger" [...] or [...] "nigga", with Marvel having complete trust in Coker's use of it: the word is used casually in the series, though some characters, including Cage, prefer not to use it. Coker said the intent was never to use it [...] "in a way where it's flippant. I used it from the standpoint of, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to eavesdrop on a conversation with African American people, with nobody else around, when would this word be used and how would it get used." [...] Coker also likened the use in the series to [...] "the way music used to treat it," [...] not having it be [...] "every other word of every other chorus, because at that point, it just gets silly." ...|$|E
