5|$|Following the attack, Sakonju judged {{that it was}} too {{dangerous}} to continue the raid as Behars <b>distress</b> <b>message</b> may have alerted the Allies to his force's presence. Accordingly, the Japanese turned back for the NEI that day. The heavy cruisers were again escorted through the Sunda Strait by Kinu, Ōi and five destroyers, and arrived back at the NEI on 15March. During this time, the Behar survivors were held in a small and extremely hot store room on board Tone, and were given little access to food and water, sanitary facilities and exercise.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after, {{the radar}} {{controller}} who handled flight 240 {{noticed that the}} aircraft was turning right beyond its assigned heading; however, his attempts to contact the crew proved futile. Approximately three minutes after the last <b>distress</b> <b>message,</b> reports began to reach ATC from the police of an aircraft crash.|$|E
25|$|Almeda Star had {{transmitted}} one <b>distress</b> <b>message</b> and the Royal Navy {{responded by}} sending seven destroyers {{to search the}} area. They found neither survivors, boats nor wreckage: all 360 people aboard were lost, including those in the four lifeboats that had been launched. U-96 {{had been at the}} scene {{for more than two hours}} but escaped undetected.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} ethical {{concerns}} {{regarding the use}} of fear appeals have been raised, leading to widespread debate regarding the acceptability of their use. For example, it has been questioned whether it is ethical to expose large numbers of people to potentially <b>distressing</b> <b>messages</b> without their consent. Hastings, Stead and Webb question whether it is ethically acceptable to expose an entire population to a <b>distressing</b> <b>message</b> intended for a specific subset of that population. For example, a fear appeal message stressing the likelihood of premature death for individuals who smoke may also reach the children of people who smoke, leading to avoidable anxiety in such groups.|$|R
25|$|The Combine {{consider}} this a positive, as the subsequent explosion would destroy all of City 17 {{and much of the}} surrounding countryside, which has been all but lost to human resistance forces. With a copy of the <b>distress</b> <b>message,</b> Gordon and Alyx escape the Citadel and meet up with Barney and other survivors. The pair escape City 17 via an evacuation train as the Citadel core goes critical, sending out the Combine message. The resulting shockwave derails their train.|$|E
25|$|However, on Christmas Eve, 1827, a {{surprise}} visit was paid by HBC Chief Trader Alexander Mackenzie from Fort Vancouver. His party having been pinned in by ice {{at the mouth}} of the Fraser River, and apparently robbed and threatened by the Musqueam, Mackenzie dispatched a sympathetic Kwantlen to convey a <b>distress</b> <b>message</b> to McMillan at Fort Langley. Upon receiving the message, McMillan sent an armed party to recover Mackenzie who was later greeted at the fort by a beaming McMillan.|$|E
25|$|Three other {{survivors}} {{managed to}} board a small liferaft. One was the duty radio officer who had sent the <b>distress</b> <b>message.</b> The others were a badly wounded DEMS gunner, EG Elliot RN, and a passenger called Frank Brothers. After they had drifted for four days they sighted a submarine and used the reflective surface of a tobacco tin as a heliograph to attract her attention. The submarine, {{which may have been}} U-124, came and gave them fresh water. The next day the weather worsened, and in the afternoon the radio officer died.|$|E
50|$|At 1115, {{more than}} two hours after the first <b>distress</b> <b>messages</b> had been {{received}} by his flagship, Halsey ordered TF 34 to turn around and head south to pursue Kurita, but the Japanese forces had already escaped.|$|R
25|$|Messages {{in bottles}} {{have been used}} in crowdsourced {{scientific}} studies of ocean currents, as well as to send <b>distress</b> <b>messages,</b> memorial tributes, final reports and letters from those believing themselves to be doomed, invitations to prospective pen pals, and letters to actual or imagined love interests.|$|R
5000|$|On 23 March <b>distress</b> <b>messages</b> {{from the}} {{wireless}} operators on the lifeboats were received, and the W class destroyer [...] from troopship convoy NA 006 {{was sent to}} the area. The survivors did not know this as the receiving part of their main radio had been lost.|$|R
25|$|According to her survivors, {{the first}} torpedo struck just aft {{of the bridge}} and caused major damage. Apparently, it {{exploded}} the ship's magazine; the resulting blast sheared off everything forward of the point of impact, destroying completely the bridge, the chart room, and the officers' and petty officers' quarters. As she stopped dead in the water, unable to signal a <b>distress</b> <b>message,</b> a second torpedo struck about 40 feet forward of the fantail and carried away the after part of the ship above the keel plates and shafts and destroyed the after crew's quarters. Only the midships section was left intact.|$|E
25|$|As McGruder's spaceship, Justice 4, {{began to}} leave the planet Hestia the flight crew were murdered, and the ship crashed. Many {{passengers}} and crew were killed, and the survivors were stranded in the hostile wilderlands of the unexplored part of the planet. Since no <b>distress</b> <b>message</b> had been sent, nobody even knew that they had crashed. McGruder received a head injury in the crash, and went into a life-threatening coma. Even though Dredd was a prisoner he assumed command, since none of the ship crew (who now all technically outranked him) were competent or experienced {{enough to keep the}} survivors alive.|$|E
25|$|General Cooke, {{on receipt}} of Carrington's <b>distress</b> <b>message,</b> {{immediately}} ordered {{that he be}} relieved of command by Brigadier General Henry W. Wessells. Wessells arrived safely at Fort Kearny on January 16 with two companies of cavalry and four of infantry. One man in his command froze to death during the journey. Carrington left Fort Kearny on January 23 {{with his wife and}} the other women and children, including the pregnant wife of the deceased Lt. Grummond. They braved temperatures as low as 38 below F (-39 C) during the journey to Fort Laramie. One half of the 60-soldier escort suffered frostbite.|$|E

50|$|Eventually, at 11:15, {{more than}} three hours after the first <b>distress</b> <b>messages</b> from 7th Fleet had been {{received}} by his flagship, Halsey ordered TF 34 to turn around and head southwards towards Samar. At this point, Lee's battleships were almost within gun range of Ozawa's force. Two-and-a-half hours were then spent refuelling TF 34's accompanying destroyers.|$|R
50|$|On 20 January 1942, she {{assisted}} in the rescue of the crew of S-36 after she ran aground on Taku Reef in the Makassar Strait.

After the rescue by the Dutch merchant ship Siberote, Sargo headed for Java, and arrived at Soerabaja on 25 January.|$|R
25|$|The Avro York was a {{military}} trooping flight for the British Air Ministry from Stansted Airport in the United Kingdom to Jamaica with six crew and 33 passengers, including both soldiers and families. The aircraft had stopped at Lajes Field in the Azores and departed at 23:25 on 1 February 1953 for Gander Airport in Newfoundland. The aircraft transmitted Positional Operational Meteorological Reports at approximately one-hour intervals from 00:10 to 04:25 on 2 February. At 04:10 the aircraft position was given as 44°32'N 41°38'W. At 05:31 Gander heard an Urgency signal from the aircraft giving a position a minute before the message as 46°15'N 46°31'W. The urgency signal {{was followed by a}} <b>distress</b> <b>message</b> SOS, SOS, SOS DE G-A the message stopped abruptly and no further communications from the aircraft were heard.|$|E
500|$|The ship {{remained}} at Wei Hai Wei {{until the end}} of August when she sailed up the Yangtze River for Hankow. She reached the inland port on 5 September and dispatched armed guards to put down unrest on several British-owned merchant ships. Her primary purpose, though, was to aid the Chinese government's survey of the massive flooding in the area. Charles Lindbergh and his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, were also in the city to survey the flooding with their Lockheed Sirius float-plane and they were invited to use the carrier as their base. Unfortunately, their aircraft was flipped on the morning of 2 October by a strong current as it was being hoisted back into the water by Hermess crane. They were quickly rescued by a boat from the carrier, but their aircraft was damaged. Captain MacKinnon offered to take them and their aircraft to Shanghai where it could be repaired and the ship departed the next day. She remained in Shanghai until 2 November, when she sailed for Hong Kong. Hermes received a <b>distress</b> <b>message</b> on 3 November from a Japanese merchantman, SS Ryinjin Maru, that had run aground on the Tan Rocks near the Chinese mainland {{at the mouth of the}} Taiwan Strait. The ship managed to rescue nine crew members before she was relieved by the [...] and could proceed to Hong Kong. She reached the city on 7 November and remained in the area until April 1932.|$|E
2500|$|On 3 August, the French {{weather ship}} Leverrier {{reported}} receiving a <b>distress</b> <b>message</b> from the aircraft. A second message was received {{early the next}} morning.

USCGC Campbell reported finding two seats from the aircraft at a position [...] east of Puerto Rico. An aircraft later reported seeing wreckage [...] from the position the seats were found. Some of the wreckage showed evidence of fire. The search for survivors was called off on 9 August.

Carrington sent Phillips and another messenger, Philip Bailey, out that evening on the Fort's best remaining horses. Phillips accomplished the 236-mile ride to Fort Laramie in four days. A blizzard began on December 22, and Phillips rode through {{a foot of snow}} and below-zero temperatures. He saw no Indians during his ride. He arrived at Fort Laramie late in the evening on December 25 during a full-dress Christmas ball, and staggered, exhausted, into the party to deliver his message.|$|E
