5|$|As Bryan spoke {{his final}} sentence, recalling the Crucifixion of Jesus, he placed <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> temples, fingers {{extended}}; {{with the final}} words, he extended his arms to his sides straight out to his body and held that pose for about five seconds as if offering himself as sacrifice for the cause, as the audience watched in dead silence. He then lowered them, descended from the podium, and began {{to head back to}} his seat as the stillness held.|$|E
500|$|As {{he spoke}} his final sentence, he brought <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> head, fingers {{extended}} {{in imitation of}} thorns; amid dead silence in the Coliseum, he extended his arms, recalling with words and posture the Crucifixion of Jesus, and held that position for several seconds. [...] He then lowered his arms, and began the journey back to his seat in the silence.|$|E

2500|$|Mehserle stood up, unholstered his gun, a SIG Sauer P226, {{and fired}} a shot into Grant's back. Immediately after the shooting, Mehserle {{appeared}} surprised and raised <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> face; according to Michael Rains, Mehserle's criminal defense attorney, several eyewitnesses described Mehserle as looking stunned.

2500|$|I {{first met}} Temple {{in the mid-1980s}} [...] annual [...] conference. Standing on the {{periphery}} of the group was a tall young woman who was obviously interested in the discussions. She seemed shy and pleasant, but mostly she just listened. I learned her name was Temple Grandin. It wasn't until later in the week that I realized she was someone with autism. I approached her and asked if she'd be willing to speak at the next year's [...] conference. She agreed. The next year Temple first addressed an [...] audience. People were standing at least three deep. The audience couldn't get enough of her. Here, for the first time, was someone who could tell us from her own experience, what it was like to be extremely sound sensitive ("like being tied to the rail and the train's coming"). She was asked many questions: [...] "Why does my son do so much spinning?" [...] "Why does he hold <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> ears?" [...] "Why doesn't he look at me?" [...] She spoke from her own experience, and her insight was impressive. There were tears in more than one set of eyes that day. Temple quickly became a much sought-after speaker in the autism community.|$|E
2500|$|Trainer Keene Fitzpatrick {{walked onto}} the field to examine Curtis and quickly saw that the leg was broken. [...] In what the Detroit Free Press {{described}} as [...] "one of the most touching scenes ever witnessed on a football field," [...] the crowd of 1,000 sitting in the bleachers fell silent and Michigan's quarterback, Harry Workman, [...] "was seen {{to come out of}} the bunch of standing players, put <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> face, and break down and weep like a child." [...] A surgeon who was in the stands came onto the field, examined Curtis, and called for an ambulance. [...] The crowd sat silently as Curtis was [...] "carefully placed on a stretcher" [...] and into the hospital wagon. [...] As the crowd finally walked slowly up State Street, the [...] "gloom was awful." [...] The Detroit Free Press wrote:"Big Joe Curtis – one of the best fellows who ever went to college – who was acknowledged to be the best tackle in the west, and who was preparing himself to play the game of his life against Pennsylvania, the last college game in which he could ever participate, and who was practically certain of recognition for the All-American team, is down and out on the eve of what was to be the great climax of his spectacular football career[...] [...] [...] 'G-L-O-O-M' spells Ann Arbor tonight." ...|$|E

60|$|As if {{from the}} {{relaxation}} of effort {{he seemed to}} be seized with violent pain. He pressed <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> sides and bent forward.|$|E
60|$|He put <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> {{mouth and}} shouted down the ravine,--it {{was almost like}} {{shouting}} down a tunnel,--and the echoes jumped from rock to rock.|$|E
