5|$|Known {{since the}} Middle Ages {{by the name}} plumb dulcis, the {{production}} of lead(II) nitrate from either metallic lead or lead oxide in nitric acid was small-scale, for <b>direct</b> <b>use</b> in making other lead compounds. In the 19th century lead(II) nitrate began to be produced commercially in Europe and the United States. Historically, the main use was as a raw material {{in the production of}} pigments for lead paints, but such paints have been superseded by less toxic paints based on titanium dioxide. Other industrial uses included heat stabilization in nylon and polyesters, and in coatings of photothermographic paper. Since around the year 2000, lead(II) nitrate has begun to be used in gold cyanidation.|$|E
5|$|The {{resistive}} Joule {{heating effect}} employed in filament light bulbs also sees more <b>direct</b> <b>use</b> in electric heating. While this is versatile and controllable, {{it can be}} seen as wasteful, since most electrical generation has already required the production of heat at a power station. A number of countries, such as Denmark, have issued legislation restricting or banning the use of resistive electric heating in new buildings. Electricity is however still a highly practical energy source for heating and refrigeration, with air conditioning/heat pumps representing a growing sector for electricity demand for heating and cooling, the effects of which electricity utilities are increasingly obliged to accommodate.|$|E
5|$|Salt {{is present}} in most foods, but in {{naturally}} occurring foodstuffs such as meats, vegetables and fruit, it {{is present in}} very small quantities. It is often added to processed foods (such as canned foods and especially salted foods, pickled foods, and snack foods or other convenience foods), where it functions as both a preservative and a flavoring. Dairy salt {{is used in the}} preparation of butter and cheese products. Before the advent of electrically powered refrigeration, salting {{was one of the main}} methods of food preservation. Thus, herring contains 67mg sodium per 100g, while kipper, its preserved form, contains 990mg. Similarly, pork typically contains 63mg while bacon contains 1,480mg, and potatoes contain 7mg but potato crisps 800mg per 100 g. The main sources of salt in the diet, apart from <b>direct</b> <b>use</b> of sodium chloride, are bread and cereal products, meat products and milk and dairy products.|$|E

5|$|All {{types of}} cooking {{involved}} the <b>direct</b> <b>use</b> of fire. Kitchen stoves {{did not appear}} until the 18th century, and cooks had {{to know how to}} cook directly over an open fire. Ovens were used, but they were expensive to construct and only existed in fairly large households and bakeries. It was common for a community to have shared ownership of an oven to ensure that the bread baking essential to everyone was made communal rather than private. There were also portable ovens designed to be filled with food and then buried in hot coals, and even larger ones on wheels that were used to sell pies in the streets of medieval towns. But for most people, almost all cooking was done in simple stewpots, since this was the most efficient use of firewood and did not waste precious cooking juices, making potages and stews the most common dishes. Overall, most evidence suggests that medieval dishes had a fairly high fat content, or at least when fat could be afforded. This was considered less of a problem in a time of back-breaking toil, famine, and a greater acceptance—even desirability—of plumpness; only the poor or sick, and devout ascetics, were thin.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{concerns}} regarding the {{environmental effects of}} the manufacture of hydrogen. Hydrogen is made either by electrolysis of water, or by fossil fuel reforming. Reforming a fossil fuel leads to a higher {{emissions of carbon dioxide}} compared with <b>direct</b> <b>use</b> of the fossil fuel in an internal combustion engine. Similarly, if hydrogen is produced by electrolysis from fossil-fuel powered generators, increased carbon dioxide is emitted in comparison with <b>direct</b> <b>use</b> of the fossil fuel.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an overview {{on the development}} of geothermal energy applications in Italy during the six-years period 2010 - 2015. In Italy, the geothermal resources are used for both electricity generation and <b>direct</b> <b>uses.</b> Power plants are located in Tuscany, in the two “historical” areas of Larderello-Travale and Mount Amiata. <b>Direct</b> <b>used</b> are widespread over the whole Italian territory. To date, Enel Green Power is the only geo-electricity producer in Italy. In the year 2014, with an installed capacity of 915. 5 MWe (807 MWe efficient capacity), the gross electricity generation reached 5. 9 billion kWh, which represents the new record of electricity produced from geothermal resource in Italy; in 2014 one additional unit (Bagnore 4) was realized, increasing the capacity from 875. 5 to 914. 5 MWe. Regarding <b>direct</b> <b>uses,</b> the installed capacity reaches the value of around 1, 300 MWt (+ 33...|$|R

25|$|Using {{renewable}} energy source to generate hydrogen by electrolysis would require greater energy input than <b>direct</b> <b>use</b> of the {{renewable energy}} to operate electric vehicles, because of the extra conversion stages and losses in distribution.

25|$|The 'spin' {{name of the}} spinor norm can be {{explained}} by a connection to the spin group (more accurately a pin group). This may now {{be explained}} quickly by Galois cohomology (which however postdates the introduction of the term by more <b>direct</b> <b>use</b> of Clifford algebras). The spin covering of the orthogonal group provides a short exact sequence of algebraic groups.|$|E
25|$|The {{limitations}} {{and disadvantages of}} electric heating in industry include the higher cost of electrical energy compared to <b>direct</b> <b>use</b> of fuel, and the capital cost of both the electric heating apparatus itself and the infrastructure required to deliver large quantities of electrical energy {{to the point of}} use. This may be somewhat offset by in-plant (on-site) efficiency gains in using less energy overall to achieve the same result.|$|E
