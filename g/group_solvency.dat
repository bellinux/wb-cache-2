40|$|When {{assessing}} <b>group</b> <b>solvency,</b> {{an important}} question is to what extent intragroup transfers may be considered, as this determines to which extent diversification can be achieved. We suggest a framework to describe the families of admissible transfers that range from the free movement of capital to excluding any transactions. The constraints on admissible transactions are described as random closed sets. The paper focuses on the corresponding solvency tests that amount {{to the existence of}} acceptable selections of the random sets of admissible transactions. Comment: 20 pages, 3 figures.

40|$|In general, {{conglomeration}} {{leads to}} a diversification of risks (the diversification benefit) and to a decrease in shareholder value (the conglomerate discount). Diversification ben-efits in financial conglomerates are typically derived without accounting for reduced shareholder value, even though a comprehensive analysis requires competitive condi-tions within the conglomerate, i. e., shareholders and debtholders receive risk-adequate returns. In this paper, we extend the literature by comparing the diversification effect in conglomerates with and without accounting for the altered shareholder value. We com-pare results for a holding company, a parent-subsidiary structure, and an integrated model. In addition, we consider different types of capital and risk transfer instruments in the parent-subsidiary model, including intra-group retrocession and guarantees. We conclude that diversification does not matter to the extent frequently emphasized in the literature when diversification effects are studied under competitive conditions. Our analysis contributes to the ongoing discussion on <b>group</b> <b>solvency</b> regulation and enter-prise risk management...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} document {{has been}} adopted by the <b>Group</b> <b>Solvency</b> Issues (E) Working Group as {{a summary of the}} US Framework for Group Supervision as of August of 2013. This document builds upon the existing Financial Analysis Handbook guidance and is being proposed to the Financial Analysis Handbook (E) Working Group for them to incorporate into the same publication to be used by states and likely beginning for 2014 Annual Statement analysis. States are encouraged to review this document prior to that date {{so that it can be}} more easily incorporated into the analysis process when it’s effective. The Financial Analysis Handbook (E) Working Group may make further changes to this document, including but not limited to: where its placed into the Financial Analysis Handbook, how certain sections (e. g. governance) are presented to the analyst, given that certain items are still pending, as well as the completion of certain other open items (group profile...|$|E
40|$|The {{corporate}} {{farms in}} Leningrad Oblast are classified into five <b>solvency</b> <b>groups</b> by {{an index of}} financial health based on the coverage of farm costs by sales revenue. The two highest <b>solvency</b> <b>groups</b> containing 35 % of the oblast farms produce 75 % of sales and generate 90 % of profit. They rapidly grow by investing in machinery and equipment and {{can be regarded as}} having fully adapted to the new market conditions. Their production efficiency is significantly higher than the efficiency of less solvent farms. A regression analysis shows that 50 % of the variability in the financial health of Leningrad farms is explained by management quality, while another 30 % is explained by farm size (farms employing more labour and more land are characterized by higher solvency).

50|$|Having an {{essential}} function in affinity marketing, {{the nature of}} the customer is indispensable for understanding the concept. In other words, {{it is important to know}} in what way or manner the relationship was built and to know which affinity group the customer belongs to. When segmenting the market, the affinity marketers also need to take into account the amount of people who are composing the <b>group,</b> <b>group</b> members' <b>solvency</b> and the receptivity to the goods and services offered. Further, in analyzing affinity marketing one needs to acknowledge the power and nature of affinity. An affinity marketing strategy is focused on one of the four different aspects of affinity. First, affinity is related to the support of a deserving cause. Second, affinity is based on relationships creating a sense of recognition in an organization that doesn't necessary have to exist (for instance a country, a family or an animal). Third, affinity comes from a sense of desiring to be part of a dissimilar social group (aspirational). Last, affinity is correlated to the wish for personally acquiring discounts, or privileges from goods and services sold by a specific organization (self-interest). But a few affinity groups use more than one of these facets to achieve their marketing scheme. For instance, very enthusiastic baseball fans support their team for a deserving cause, identify themselves in their team, and personally benefit from discounts and advantages.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} one principal idea to {{the methodology}} of solvency studies for the life insurance industry. The idea is grouping, which is applied in two different ways. First, companies are grouped into industry segments by insurer specialization or by size. Second, predictor variables are grouped into thematically related motifs. The primary benefits of <b>grouping</b> are improved <b>solvency</b> prediction and improved interpretation of predictors. Improved prediction results from industry segmentation; improved interpretation from predictor motifs. The models are developed by the technique of cascaded logistic regression, which forecasts solvency status {{on the basis of}} motifs, rather than of individual variables. A key finding is that the segments differ in their significant motifs in anticipated ways. For example, investment motifs are important for solvency in the Life and Annuities segments, but not in the Health segment. A similar pattern characterizes the difference between large and small insurers. The study covers the 1990 through 1992 time period, when there were a historically high number of troubled companies...|$|R
40|$|In the {{valuation}} of the Solvency II Capital Requirement, the correct appraisal of risk dependencies acquires particular relevance. These dependencies {{refer to the}} recognition of risk diversification in the aggregation process and there are different levels of aggregation and hence different types of diversification. For instance, for a non-life company at the first level the risk components of each single line of business (e. g. premium, reserve and CAT risks) need to be combined in the overall portfolio, the second level regards the aggregation of different kind of risks as, for example, market and underwriting risk, and finally various solo legal entities could be joined together in a <b>group.</b> <b>Solvency</b> II allows companies to capture these diversification effects in capital requirement assessment, but the identification of a proper methodology can represent a delicate issue. Indeed, while Internal Models by simulation approaches permit usually to obtain the portfolio multivariate distribution only in the independence case, generally the use of copula functions can consent to have the multivariate distribution under dependence assumptions too. However {{the choice of the}} copula and the parameter estimation could be very problematic when only few data are available. So it could be useful to find a closed formula based on Internal Models independence results with the aim to obtain the capital requirement under dependence assumption. A simple technique, to measure the diversification effect in capital requirement assessment, is the formula, proposed by Solvency II Quantitative Impact Studies (QIS), focused on the aggregation of capital charges, the latter equal to percentile minus average of total claims amount distribution of single line of business (LoB), using a linear correlation matrix. On the other hand, this formula produces the correct result only for a restricted class of distributions, while it may underestimate the diversification effect. In this paper we present an alternative method, based on the idea to adjust that formula with proper calibration factors (proposed by Sandström, (2007)) and appropriately extended with the aim to consider very skewed distribution too. In the last part considering different non-life multi-line insurers, we compare the Capital Requirements obtained, for only premium risk, applying the aggregation formula to the results derived by elliptical copulas and Hierarchical Archimedean Copulas...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{financial}} and economic crisis influencing {{economic development in}} EU countries is analysed predominately on macroeconomic level. Major part of economic studies analyse the effect of crisis on both real and potential economic growth, unemployment, inflation and debt dynamic. However {{the effects of the}} crisis are visible also at microeconomic level. The economic results of businesses are significantly influenced by the negative macroeconomic development at both national and international level. Both decrease in potential growth and purchasing power due to economic recession and more restrictive fiscal policy have a direct impact on aggregate demand and thus the microeconomic sector as whole. Additional source of problems is connected with banking sector crisis and the access to financing mainly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SME’s). The aim of the paper is to fill the gap in economic research and to analyse the impact of the ongoing crisis on business entities in selected eurozone member countries. Authors selected two eurozone member countries from EU periphery (Greece and Ireland). Both countries are severely hit by economic crisis and authors suppose that also their business sector will be significantly influenced. However author believes that the structural differences will lead over the time in faster recovery of Irish businesses in contrast to the Greek one. We create dataset using Amadeus database which contains the harmonized data about statistically significant set of business in selected countries. Authors then sorting the data according selected variables such as size of the company, NACE categorization and comparative indicators of individual business economic performance, namely representatives of indicators <b>groups</b> profitability, <b>solvency,</b> liquidity and indebtedness/financial structure of business entities. For the purpose of analysis authors analyse the data series three years before the crisis (2005, 2006 and 2007) and the three years of crisis (2008, 2009 and 2010). The dataset consists of 3, 567 business entities in both observed countries. In the study we use the cluster analysis to detect some basic patterns and trends in business sector in terms of homogeneity within dataset. Based on the results of microeconomic environment analysis (impact of crisis and national economic policies) authors assess the optimal reaction of economic policy (both national and EU) to improve the condition of businesses which authors believe are the source of future economic recovery...|$|R
