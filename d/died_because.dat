5|$|In Belize, the {{hurricane}} was less severe than initially predicted, though Mitch still caused heavy rainfall across the country. Numerous rivers exceeded their crests, though the rainfall was beneficial to trees in mountainous areas. The flooding caused extensive crop damage and destroyed many roads. Throughout the country, eleven people <b>died</b> <b>because</b> of {{the hurricane}}.|$|E
5|$|An inquest into Lynott's {{death was}} held at Birmingham Coroner's Court in January 2003. The hearing was told that marks found {{on her back and}} an arm may have been bruising, but the {{pathologist}} who conducted the original post mortem could not be sure how she had <b>died,</b> <b>because</b> her body had lain undiscovered for up to seven days. It was also said that, despite her connection with Smith, police and four pathologists had failed to establish that Lynott had been murdered. The inquest jury returned an open verdict.|$|E
5|$|Early script drafts had Henry accidentally kill Louise Mortimer, but {{producers}} {{were never}} satisfied with this development, thinking Henry would have failed if she died. Writers also posited that Henry's father's murder involved revenge {{after he had}} an affair, but the producers and Gatiss {{found it easier to}} mention he <b>died</b> <b>because</b> he learned of Franklin's experiments with the hallucinogenic gas. The ending also changed; the final scene had originally involved Moriarty entering the Tower of London but that was held back for the following episode.|$|E

5|$|In {{the months}} that followed, {{scientists}} and doctors studied the smog's impact. It {{became clear that the}} smog had been a major environmental disaster with severe public health effects. One study estimated that 10 percent of the city's population suffered adverse health effects, such as stinging eyes, coughing, and respiratory distress. City health officials initially maintained that the smog had not caused any deaths. Later, a statistical analysis found that 168 people had likely <b>died</b> <b>because</b> of the smog. Another study found that the smog had shortened the lifespans of 366 people.|$|E
5|$|In the {{municipality}} of Atlamajalcingo, a woman died after {{a collapse of}} a dwelling. In Chilpancingo, the capital of Guerrero, four people perished. Numerous trees were downed and power outages were reported. Additionally, the nearby Cerrito Rico dam nearly overflowed its banks. In the Tecpan municipality, four rivers overflowed their banks and six people <b>died</b> <b>because</b> of landslides. Many mountainous communities were isolated, thus making in difficult to receive aid.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium is more {{dangerous}} when inhaled than when ingested. The risk {{of lung cancer}} increases once the total radiation dose equivalent of inhaled plutonium exceeds 400 mSv. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that the lifetime cancer risk from inhaling 5,000 plutonium particles, each about 3µm wide, to be 1% over the background U.S. average. Ingestion or inhalation of large amounts may cause acute radiation poisoning and possibly death. However no human being {{is known to have}} <b>died</b> <b>because</b> of inhaling or ingesting plutonium, and many people have measurable amounts of plutonium in their bodies.|$|E

5|$|After {{leaving the}} wrestling business, Greenwald has made {{sporadic}} wrestling appearances, {{acts as a}} landlady with regards to her property holdings, invests in real estate, and performs charity work.

5|$|The {{second season}} begins {{six weeks after}} the end of the first, where Magnus works hard to defeat the Cabal and save Ashley, whom the Cabal {{transformed}} to a vampire-hybrid superabnormal, one of six tasked to destroy the Sanctuary Network. When the superabnormals arrive at the Old City Sanctuary, Magnus is able to get through to Ashley, who recognises her in time to save her from another superabnormal, and then teleports. Because an electromagnetic field is active, it would mean whoever teleports inside would be vaporized. Despite this, Magnus believes Ashley's life energy may be in the electromagnetic field's buffer. When it does not, she is forced to accept that Ashley has <b>died.</b> <b>Because</b> of her death, and other loved ones because of her longevity, she tried to find a way to age at a normal rate again. She finds an elixir used by the Mayans in Honduras, but it has the side effect of turning humans into zombie-like creatures. After being shown the potential consequences of the elixir's release by an incorporeal guardian, she decides to leave it behind.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{began at}} about 9am on 14 October 1066 and lasted all day, but while a broad outline is known, the exact events are {{obscured}} by contradictory accounts in the sources. Although {{the numbers on}} each side were probably about equal, William had both cavalry and infantry, including many archers, while Harold had only foot soldiers and few archers. The English soldiers formed up as a shield wall along the ridge, and were at first so effective that William's army was thrown back with heavy casualties. Some of William's Breton troops panicked and fled, {{and some of the}} English troops appear to have pursued the fleeing Bretons. Norman cavalry then attacked and killed the pursuing troops. While the Bretons were fleeing, rumours swept the Norman forces that the duke had been killed, but William rallied his troops. Twice more the Normans made feigned withdrawals, tempting the English into pursuit, and allowing the Norman cavalry to attack them repeatedly. The available sources are more confused about events in the afternoon, but it appears that the decisive event was the death of Harold, about which differing stories are told. William of Jumieges claimed that Harold was killed by the duke. The Bayeux Tapestry has been claimed to show Harold's death by an arrow to the eye, but this may be a later reworking of the tapestry to conform to 12th-century stories that Harold had died from an arrow wound to the head. Other sources stated that no one knew how Harold <b>died</b> <b>because</b> the press of battle was so tight around the king that the soldiers could not see who struck the fatal blow. William of Poitiers gives no details at all about Harold's death.|$|E
