40|$|The Perméafor is an in situ {{soil testing}} device {{developed}} in the early 80 's. The probe has a conical shape and is pushed or hammered into the ground using a conventional drill rig. The tool is advanced through the subsurface at a constant rate while water is injected through a screen at the mid level of the probe. A quick estimate of the permeability profile of ground layers encountered can be derived. The permeability profile obtained is complemented by a penetration curve (elapsed time for 20 cm <b>driving</b> <b>depth)</b> in order to evaluate {{the quality of the}} soil. The device has been recently modified to include a piezocone tip. This paper presents calibration of this test with water tests performed in laboratory and in situ {{and the use of the}} new version of the device during a dike survey campaign and comparison of this test with pumping tests, Lefranc tests and standard electric cone penetration testing...|$|E
40|$|According to {{the authors}} the lack of {{evaluation}} methods for efficiency of pile behavior leads to an increased degree of randomness {{in the selection of}} type, material, shape and placement of piles, and, as a consequence, to overspending the material, energy, labor costs and, respectively, to more expensive construction. The work is devoted to the determination of the efficiency of piles of various cross-sectional forms (round, square, cross- shaped, T-shaped and double tee forms). A number of methods and criteria for quantitative evaluation of the efficiency of piles were proposed. Furthermore, the results of studies of the pile efficiency depending on the <b>driving</b> <b>depth</b> at the above-mentioned forms of cross-sections were given. Researches have shown that quantitative values of pile efficiency are approximately the same for the following forms for round and square cross-section; for T-shaped and double tee; and the are exactly the same for cross-shaped and T-shaped cross-section. Analysis of considered piles forms showed that maximum efficiency was achieved under the minimum depth of 2 meters, and then it gradually decreased. Also there was found an anomaly: at a depth of 10 meters the efficiency of cross sections with the tabs (III, IV, and V-shaped branchy) again begins to rise slowly. The results allow us to optimize more accurately the selection of the pile component in the foundation design...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, field {{experiments}} are mostly {{used to determine}} the resistance and settlements of a soil before building. The needed devices were heavy so they cannot be used in every situation. It is the reason why Gourves et al (1998) developed a light dynamic penetrometer called Panda. For this penetrometer, a standardized hammer has to be blown on the head of the piston. For each blow, it measures the driving energy as well as the <b>driving</b> <b>depth</b> of the cone into the soil. The obtained penetrogram gives us the cone resistance variation with depth. For homogeneous soils, three parameters can determined: the critical depth zc, the initial cone resistance qd 0 and the cone resistance in depth qd 1. In parallel to the improvement of this apparatus, some researches were lead to obtain a relationship between the dry density of soil and the cone resistance in depth qd 1. Knowing dry density of soil can allow to evaluate compaction efficiency for example. To achieve this point, a database of soils was initiated. Each of these soils was tested and classified using laboratory tests, among others, grain size distribution, proctor results, Atterberg limits. Penetrometer tests were also performed for three to five densities and for three to five water contents. Using this database, Chaigneau managed to obtain a logarithmic relation linking qd 1 and dry density. But this relation varies with the water content. This article presents our recent researches on a mean to obtain a unified relation using water content, saturation degree or suction. To achieve this point, at first we studied the CNR silt responses with saturation degree and water content. Its water retention curve was realised using filter paper method so we can obtain suction. Then we verified the conclusion of this study to seven soils of the database to validate our hypotheses...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of {{environmental}} <b>driving</b> factors (maximum <b>depth,</b> visibility, oxygen, temperature, and prey densities) on the distribution and diet composition of Nile perch (Lates niloticus) in south-east Lake Victoria from 2009 to 2011. We tested the hypotheses that (i) Nile perch distribution is regulated by the same environmental factors on a local scale (Mwanza Gulf) and on a regional scale (Mwanza Gulf, Speke Gulf and the open lake in Sengerema district), and (ii) driving factors act differently on different Nile perch size classes. Fish were sampled with gillnets. Nile perch densities were highest in the shallow part of the Mwanza Gulf and during the wet seasons, mainly caused by high densities of juveniles. The environmental driving factors explained Nile perch distributions on both regional and local scales in a similar way, often showing non-linear relationships. Maximum depth and temperature were the best predictors of Nile perch densities. Prey densities of shrimp and haplochromines did not strongly affect Nile perch distributions, but did explain Nile perch diet on a local and regional scale. We conclude that abiotic variables drive Nile perch distributions more strongly than prey densities and that feeding takes place opportunistically...|$|R
40|$|Tidewater glaciers in Greenland {{experienced}} widespread retreat {{during the}} last century. Information on their behaviour prior to this is often poorly constrained {{due to lack of}} observations, while determining the drivers prior to instrumental records is also problematic. Here we present a record of the dynamics of Kangiata Nunaata Sermia (KNS), southwest Greenland, from its Little Ice Age maximum (LIAmax) to 1859 – the period before continuous air temperature observations began at Nuuk in 1866. Using glacial geomorphology, historical accounts, photographs and GIS analyses, we provide evidence KNS was at its LIAmax by 1761, had retreated by ∼ 5 km by 1808 and a further 7 km by 1859. This predates retreat at Jakobshavn Isbrae by 43 – 113 years, demonstrating the asynchroneity of tidewater glacier terminus response following the LIA. We use a one-dimensional flowband model to determine the relative sensitivity of KNS to atmospheric and oceanic climate forcing. Results demonstrate that terminus forcing rather than surface mass balance drove the retreat. Modelled glacier sensitivity to submarine melt rates is also insufficient to explain the retreat observed. However, moderate increases in crevasse water <b>depth,</b> <b>driving</b> an increase in calving, are capable of causing terminus retreat of the observed magnitude and timing...|$|R
40|$|Vibration driving of {{elements}} into a soil {{is a complex}} mechanical process, accompanied with such phenomena, as a changing of structure of surrounding the driving element soil, liquefaction of them, the decreasing of friction forces between soil and surface of the driving element. A vibration method is used for driving {{of elements}} with the comparatively small cross section area: metallic sheet piles and pipes; length of sinking elements is not limited. When periodically changing axial force is acting on the driving elements there is possibility of loss of dynamical stability of element because of parametric resonance. Such possibility appears when motion of element bottom end is obstructed by the layers of very hard soil (for example, rocky) or because of densification of the liquefied sandy soil after technological pause in vibrodriving. In this work it is suggested to check up the parameters of vibrators using the simulation of pile driving process and examination of pile dynamical stability. The plastic model of shaft and toe resistance of soils during vibrodriving is developed {{taking into account the}} change of properties of soils on the depth, equation of motion of pile in soil is derived and solved numerically. The analysis of numerical solution shows the possibility of element <b>driving</b> to required <b>depth</b> by one vibrator with given performance figures, or the necessity of additional static set-on-weight, additional vibrator or changing of vibrator. The possibility of origination of dynamical instability and condition of resonance is examined on the models of pile as a perfectly solid and as a flexible beam. Possibility of dynamic stability loose on the higher mode of vibrations is proved for the driving elements from the often applied metallic rolled sections, examined as flexible beams...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of deep {{convection}} and magnetic fields on solar supergranulation. While supergranulation was originally identified as a convective flow from relatively great depth below the solar surface, recent work suggests that supergranules may originate near the surface. We use the MURaM code to simulate solar-like surface convection with a realistic photosphere and domain size up to 197 x 197 x 49 Mm 3. This yields nearly five orders of magnitude of density contrast between the bottom of the domain and the photosphere which is the most stratified solar-like convection simulations that we are aware of. Magnetic fields were thought to be a passive tracer in the photosphere, but recent work suggests that magnetism could provide a mechanism that enhances the supergranular scale flows at the surface. In particular, the enhanced radiative losses through long lived magnetic network elements may increase the lifetime of photospheric downflows and help organize low wavenumber flows. Since our simulation does not have sufficient resolution to resolve increased cooling by magnetic bright points, we artificially increase the radiative cooling in elements with strong magnetic ux. These simulations increase the cooling by 10 % for magnetic field strength greater than 100 G. We find no statistically significant difference in the velocity or magnetic field spectrum by enhancing the radiative cooling. We also find no differences in the time scale of the flows or the length scales of the magnetic energy spectrum. This suggests that the magnetic field is determined by the flows and is largely a passive tracer. We use these simulations to construct a two-component model of the flows: for scales smaller than the driving (integral) scale (which is four times the local density scale height) the flows follow a Kolmogorov (k- 5 / 3) spectrum, while larger scale modes decay with height from their <b>driving</b> <b>depth</b> (i. e. the depth where the wavelength of the mode is equal to the driving (integral) scale). This model reproduces the MURaM results well and suggests that the low wavenumber power in the photosphere imprints from below. In particular, the amplitude of the driving (integral) scale mode at each depth determines how much power imprints on the surface flows. This is validated by MURaM simulations of varying depth that show that increasing depths contribute power at a particular scale (or range of scales) that is always at lower wavenumbers than shallower flows. The mechanism for this imprinting remains unclear but, given the importance of the balances in the continuity equation to determining the spectrum of the flows, we suggest that pressure perturbations in the convective upflows are the imprinting mechanism. By comparing the MURaM simulations to SDO/HMI observations (using the coherent structure tracking code to compute the inferred horizontal velocities on both data sets), we find that the simulations have significant excess power for scales larger than supergranulation. The only way to match observations is by using an artificial energy flux to transport the solar luminosity for all depths greater than 10 Mm below the photosphere (down {{to the bottom of the}} domain at 49 Mm depth). While magnetic fields from small-scale dynamo simulations help reduce the rms velocity required to transport the solar luminosity below the surface, this provides only a small reduction in low wavenumber power in the photosphere. The convective energy transport in the Sun is constrained by theoretical models and the solar radiative luminosity. The amplitude or scale of the convective flows that transport the energy, however, are not constrained. The strong low wavenumber flows found in these local simulations are also present in current generation global simulations. While local or global dynamo magnetic fields may help suppress these large-scale flows, the magnetic fields must be substantially stronger throughout the convection domains for these simulations to match observations. The significant decrease in low wavenumber flow amplitude in the artificial energy flux simulation that matches the observed photospheric horizontal velocity spectrum suggests that convection in the Sun transports the solar luminosity with much weaker large-scale flows. This suggests that we do not understand how convective transport works in the Sun for depths greater than 10 Mm below the photosphere...|$|E
40|$|Because of fuel consumption, {{machinery}} and labor costs, tillage involves high expenses. In {{a project that}} {{was carried out in}} the autumn of 2001 and 2002, energy consumption and draught were studied for three tillage implements on a lighter and a heavier soil under wet, moist and dry conditions. Furthermore, aggregate size distribution and energy requirement for fracturing the soil were measured. The tillage implements used were mouldboard plough, chisel plough and disc cultivator. The effects of <b>driving</b> speed and <b>depth</b> of tillage were also studied. Soil strength was measured with both a penetrometer and a shear vane apparatus. The tractor used was a Valmet 6600 (100 hp) with equipment for measuring fuel consumption. The equipment was calibrated to give the PTO effect for any combination of fuel consumption and engine speed, and this was assumed to be the same as the effect available at the tractor wheels. The “tow bar power” was calculated by subtraction of power losses through wheel slip and rolling resistance. Average actual working depth was calculated by measuring bulk density before tillage and then weighing the cultivated soil. On the basis of the tillage depth and PTO effect measurements, it was possible to calculate energy requirement per kg cultivated soil and specific draught. The latter is defined as force per cross sectional area cultivated soil [kN/m 2]. After sieving samples of the cultivated soil, the approximate surface area of the fragmented soil and the energy requirement for fracturing were computed. Specific draught was lowest for the mouldboard plough, while the highest values were obtained for the chisel plough. Specific draught decreased with increasing soil water content. The lowest values of energy requirement for fracturing were measured under moist conditions for all tillage implements, and the disc cultivator produced the highest fracturing in relation to energy input. Both specific draught and energy requirement for fracturing were lower for the lighter soil. With the disc cultivator, specific draught increased with working depth, while depth had no influence on specific draught when the mouldboard plough was used. Some of these differences can be explained by differences in geometry between the tools. There was a tendency for specific draught to increase with increased driving speed. This was most obvious on the lighter soil and for the mouldboard plough. The increased draught can be explained by a higher acceleration of soil particles and by increased soil strength because of higher deformation rate. Soil strength and thereby draught requirement differed between soils and moisture contents. There was a strong correlation between soil cohesion and draught requirement, and cohesion was easily measured in the field with a shear vane. The penetrometer measurements did not correlate with draught measurements. Specific draught was lowest for the mouldboard plough. When considering the overall results of tillage, no one implement can be identified as being the most effective. Tillage at water content close to the plastic limit seems to be a good compromise as regards draught requirement and tillage result...|$|R
