25|$|Another {{factor that}} aided Ribbentrop's rise was Hitler's {{distrust}} of, and disdain for, Germany's professional diplomats. He suspected {{that they did}} not entirely support his revolution. But the Foreign Office diplomats loyally served the government and rarely gave Hitler grounds for criticism. The Foreign Office diplomats were ultra-nationalist, authoritarian, and anti-Semitic. As a result, there was enough overlap <b>in</b> <b>values</b> between the two groups to allow most of them to work comfortably for the Nazis. Nonetheless, Hitler never quite trusted the Foreign Office and was on the lookout for someone to carry out his foreign-policy goals.|$|E
25|$|With {{the change}} <b>in</b> <b>values</b> imposed by {{communist}} ideology, {{the tradition of}} preservation was broken. Independent preservation societies, even those that defended only secular landmarks such as Moscow-based OIRU were disbanded {{by the end of}} the 1920s. A new anti-religious campaign, launched in 1929, coincided with collectivization of peasants; destruction of churches in the cities peaked around 1932. A number of churches were demolished, including the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow. In Moscow alone losses of 1917–2006 are estimated at over 640 notable buildings (including 150 to 200 listed buildings, out of a total inventory of 3,500) – some disappeared completely, others were replaced with concrete replicas.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} written {{records indicate}} the Egyptians and Babylonians used all the elementary arithmetic operations {{as early as}} 2000BC.

The hieroglyphic system for Egyptian numerals, like the later Roman numerals, descended from tally marks used for counting. In both cases, this origin resulted <b>in</b> <b>values</b> that used a decimal base but did not include positional notation. Complex calculations with Roman numerals required the assistance of a counting board or the Roman abacus to obtain the results.|$|E

2500|$|The initial {{experience}} of the EMS was disappointing. It had been expected that the Irish Pound would appreciate <b>in</b> <b>value</b> against Sterling, and hence reduce inflation in Ireland, but in practice Sterling appreciated considerably <b>in</b> <b>value</b> thanks to {{its status as a}} petrocurrency and to the tight monetary policies of the new British government of Margaret Thatcher. By late 1980 the Irish Pound had fallen <b>in</b> <b>value</b> to less than 80 British pence, and Irish inflation was higher than British. Economic policy in Ireland was inconsistent with a [...] "hard currency" [...] policy, and the Irish Pound also failed to hold its value against the central rate of the Deutschmark, although it did appreciate <b>in</b> <b>value</b> against some of the other EMS currencies.|$|R
25|$|Max Weber {{and some}} schools of {{modernization}} theory suggest that cultural values could affect economic success. However, researchers have gathered evidence {{that suggest that}} values are not as deeply ingrained and that changing economic opportunities explain most of the movement {{into and out of}} poverty, as opposed to shifts <b>in</b> <b>values.</b> Studies have shown that poverty changes the personalities of children who live in it. The Great Smoky Mountains Study was a ten-year study that was unexpectedly able to demonstrate this. During the study, about one-quarter of the families saw a dramatic and unexpected increase in income. The study showed that among these children, instances of behavioral and emotional disorders decreased, and conscientiousness and agreeableness increased.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there is}} {{disagreement}} {{about whether it}} marked a permanent change <b>in</b> <b>values.</b> Cowie and Salvatore in 2008 {{argued that it was}} a response to depression and did not mark a commitment to a welfare state because America has always been too individualistic. MacLean rejected the idea of a definitive political culture. She says they overemphasized individualism and ignored the enormous power that big capital wields, the Constitutional restraints on radicalism, and the role of racism, antifeminism, and homophobia. She warns that accepting Cowie and Salvatore's argument that conservatism's ascendancy is inevitable would dismay and discourage activists on the left. Klein responds that the New Deal did not die a natural death; it was killed off in the 1970s by a business coalition mobilized by such groups as the Business Roundtable, the Chamber of Commerce, trade organizations, conservative think tanks, and decades of sustained legal and political attacks.|$|E
25|$|Forums {{prefer a}} premise of open and free {{discussion}} and often adopt de facto standards. Most common topics on forums include questions, comparisons, polls of opinion {{as well as}} debates. It {{is not uncommon for}} nonsense or unsocial behavior to sprout as people lose temper, especially if the topic is controversial. Poor understanding of differences <b>in</b> <b>values</b> of the participants is a common problem on forums. Because replies to a topic are often worded aimed at someone's point of view, discussion will usually go slightly off into several directions as people question each other's validity, sources and so on. Circular discussion and ambiguity in replies can extend for several tens of posts of a thread eventually ending when everyone gives up or attention spans waver and a more interesting subject takes over. It is not uncommon for debate to end in ad hominem attacks.|$|E

40|$|The {{implementation}} of electronic procurement processes for product-service bundles, consisting of product- and service components requires {{a consideration of}} strategic, tactical and operational procurement and {{information and communication technologies}} <b>in</b> <b>value</b> networks. <b>In</b> the past, the scientific discussion oriented on traditional procurement processes for products and technology-solutions. Increasingly, the design of hybrid procurement processes <b>in</b> <b>value</b> networks is of scientific interest. The combination of different procurement processes for products and services, however, includes problems. This paper shows the need for a process-oriented approach in procurement at several abstraction levels. We describe a model for the design of the electronic procurement process <b>in</b> <b>value</b> networks to serve product-service bundles. Different process characteristics are investigated for the applicability of product-service bundles and SCOR. We adjust a proposal for the procurement process <b>in</b> <b>value</b> networks...|$|R
