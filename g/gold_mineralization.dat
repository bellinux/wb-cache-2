Remnants of volcanic vents are an important locator for mineral potential in the Temagami belt because they are adjacent to rocks that contain certain types of mineralization. At the Link Lake Formation, good evidence for copper-zinc massive sulfide deposits has been discovered in associated volcanic rocks. Some <b>gold</b> <b>mineralization</b> may also be associated with volcanic vents. Studies of greenstone terranes in the Superior craton have shown that large gold deposits are associated with regional deformation zones. Therefore, the Northeast Arm Deformation Zone, the Link Lake Shear Zone and the Net Lake-Vermilion Lake Deformation Zone are obvious high potential areas. A number of scattered pyrite deposits can be found throughout the Northeast Arm Deformation Zone. The high frequency of <b>gold</b> <b>mineralization</b> in and near the Net Lake-Vermilion Lake Deformation Zone suggests that this deformation zone may very well also contain gold deposits; at least 11 have been discovered within a [...] length of the deformation zone. The gold deposits are found in many rock types, indicating a stronger gold-bearing system with the potential of larger gold deposits. A number of gold-pyrite deposits exist in felsic volcanic rocks overlying the Older Volcanic Complex, near and on the northwestern part of the Net Lake-Vermilion Lake Deformation Zone.

Hyperspectral imaging and thin section microscopy were used for mineral identification and mineral grain sampling.

The &# 197;kerberg gold ore is unusual given the noted lack of alteration, a scarcity of sulfides and gold associated with thin (mm-cm wide) parallel quartz veins hosted in a gabbro. The gold content is positively correlated with the density of quartz veins, but gold often occurs between veins and also in parts of the gabbro where there is no veining.

The &# 197;kerberg ore is interpreted as a sheeted vein complex, with veins constrained to tensional cracks induced when a granodioritic magma intruded the competent, sheet-like gabbro intrusion.

40|$|International audienceContinental {{extension}} is {{an important}} geodynamical process mostly diagnostic of a peculiar behaviour of the crust accommodated by geological structures that highlight these specific conditions in the crust. Though a Metamorphic Core Complex (MCC) reveals a much stronger crustal extension than a synkinematic pluton, the nature of those two structures implies different implications in terms of crustal extension mechanisms and geodynamic significations. In eastern Asia, a major continental extensional event occurred during Mesozoic and early Cenozoic times. The resulting various extensional events described in previous studies consist in large intracontinental basins, important volcanism, emplacement of plutons in the upper-crust and exhumation of MCCs. An efficient description of MCCs and plutons in eastern Asia is essential to discriminate important differences of those two structures in terms of strain amount undergone by continental crust and geodynamic significations. In that way, an integrated structural and geophysical study has been realized to precisely discriminate the structure in the Jiaodong Peninsula (Shandong Province, eastern China), previously regarded as simple sheared plutons. A succession of three main stages have been identified all pertaining to a NW-SE extensional setting: (1) the exhumation of the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous Linglong MCC below the SE-dipping Linglong detachment fault, (2) the emplacement of the Guojialing syntectonic pluton below the N-dipping extensional Guojialing intracrustal shear zone (130 - 124 Ma) and (3) a penetrative brittle normal faulting associated with <b>gold</b> <b>mineralizations</b> (not, vert, similar 120 Ma).
