5|$|The glass forms include {{borosilicate}} {{glasses and}} phosphate glasses. Borosilicate nuclear waste <b>glasses</b> <b>are</b> used on an industrial scale to immobilize high level radioactive waste {{in many countries}} which are producers of nuclear energy or have nuclear weaponry. The glass waste forms {{have the advantage of}} being able to accommodate a wide variety of waste-stream compositions, they are easy to scale up to industrial processing, and they are stable against thermal, radiative, and chemical perturbations. These glasses function by binding radioactive elements to nonradioactive glass-forming elements. Phosphate glasses while not being used industrially have much lower dissolution rates than borosilicate glasses, which make them a more favorable option. However, no single phosphate material has the ability to accommodate all of the radioactive products so phosphate storage requires more reprocessing to separate the waste into distinct fractions. Both glasses have to be processed at elevated temperatures making them unusable for some of the more volatile radiotoxic elements.|$|E
25|$|Lanthanum oxide {{is used in}} optical materials, {{often the}} optical <b>glasses</b> <b>are</b> doped with La2O3 to improve the glass' {{refractive}} index, chemical durability, and mechanical strength.|$|E
25|$|Glasses, {{also known}} as {{eyeglasses}} or spectacles, are devices consisting of glass or hard plastic lenses mounted in a frame that holds {{them in front of}} a person's eyes, typically using a bridge over the nose and arms which rest over the ears. <b>Glasses</b> <b>are</b> typically used for vision correction, such as with reading glasses and glasses used for nearsightedness. Safety glasses provide eye protection against flying debris for construction workers or lab technicians; these glasses may have protection for the sides of the eyes {{as well as in the}} lenses. Some types of safety <b>glasses</b> <b>are</b> used to protect against visible and near-visible light or radiation. <b>Glasses</b> <b>are</b> worn for eye protection in some sports, such as squash. Glasses wearers may use a strap to prevent the glasses from falling off during movement or sports. Wearers of glasses that are used only part of the time may have the glasses attached to a cord that goes around their neck, to prevent the loss of the glasses.|$|E
50|$|<b>Glass</b> {{cookware}} <b>is</b> {{another common}} usage. Borosilicate <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> used for measuring cups, featuring screen printed markings providing graduated measurements. Borosilicate <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> sometimes used for high-quality beverage glassware. Borosilicate <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> thin and durable, microwave- and dishwasher-safe.|$|R
50|$|Cased <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> {{a type of}} <b>glass.</b> It <b>is</b> {{similar to}} flashed glass however, cased <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> made with thicker glass layers.|$|R
50|$|Satin <b>glass</b> can <b>be</b> {{used for}} {{decorative}} items. However, satin <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> {{also used to}} provide privacy where the full transparency of <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> undesirable.|$|R
25|$|In typical natural {{conditions}} normalized corrosion rates of silicate <b>glasses</b> <b>are</b> very low and {{are of the}} order of 10−7–10−5 g/(cm2·d). The very high durability of silicate glasses in water makes them suitable for hazardous and nuclear waste immobilisation.|$|E
25|$|As {{more and}} more governments are restricting the use of glass in pubs and clubs due to the {{increased}} incidence of glassings, polycarbonate <b>glasses</b> <b>are</b> becoming popular for serving alcohol because of their strength, durability, and glass-like feel.|$|E
25|$|In April 2010, Guinness {{redesigned}} the Guinness pint {{glass for}} the first time in a decade. The new glass is taller and narrower than the previous one and features a bevel design. The new <b>glasses</b> <b>are</b> planned to gradually replace the old ones.|$|E
40|$|Purpose of {{my thesis}} is to apprasial {{of quality of}} flat glass. Firstly the <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> introduced, next glass-making, {{characteristics}} and kinds of <b>glass</b> <b>are</b> mentioned. Next implementing legislation and disagreements of <b>glass</b> <b>are</b> desribed. The most frequent disagreemets are explored. In this part quality control tools are applied, Pareto a Ishikawa diagram. Finally the quality of flat <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> evaluated...|$|R
50|$|Smoked <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> <b>glass</b> held in {{the smoke}} of a candle flame (or other inefficiently burning hydrocarbon) such that one surface of the sheet of <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> covered in a layer of smoke residue. The <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> then used as a medium for {{recording}} pen traces in scientific instruments.|$|R
50|$|Architectural <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> <b>glass</b> that <b>is</b> {{used as a}} {{building}} material. It is most typically used as transparent glazing material in the building envelope, including windows in the external walls. <b>Glass</b> <b>is</b> also used for internal partitions and as an architectural feature. When used in buildings, <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> often of a safety type, which include reinforced, toughened and laminated glasses.|$|R
25|$|Aluminosilicate glass: silica + alumina + lime + {{magnesia}} + {{barium oxide}} (BaO) + boric oxide (B2O3). Extensively used for fiberglass, used for making glass-reinforced plastics (boats, fishing rods, etc.) and for halogen bulb glass. Aluminosilicate <b>glasses</b> <b>are</b> also resistant to weathering and water erosion.|$|E
25|$|The {{samples of}} {{pyroclastic}} <b>glasses</b> <b>are</b> of green, yellow, and red tints. The difference in color indicates {{the concentration of}} titanium that the rock has, with the green particles having the lowest concentrations (about 1%), and red particles having the highest concentrations (up to 14%, {{much more than the}} basalts with the highest concentrations).|$|E
25|$|Bioactive <b>glasses</b> <b>are</b> a {{group of}} surface {{reactive}} glass-ceramics. The biocompatibility of these glasses has led them to be investigated extensively for use as implant materials {{in the human body}} to repair and replace diseased or damaged bone. Bioactive glass was invented in 1969 by Larry Hench {{and his colleagues at the}} University of Florida.|$|E
50|$|Annealed <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> <b>glass</b> without {{internal}} stresses caused by heat treatment, i.e., rapid cooling, or by toughening or heat strengthening. Glass becomes annealed {{if it is}} heated above a transition point then allowed to cool slowly, without being quenched. Float <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> annealed {{during the process of}} manufacture. However, most toughened <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> made from float <b>glass</b> that has <b>been</b> specially heat-treated.|$|R
500|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>was</b> used to {{incorporate}} into the bands of slate. The <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> [...] thick and was cut and installed by the Architectural Glass Department at Swansea Institute of Higher Education. <b>Glass</b> <b>is</b> {{not used in}} the contemporary British architectural style of the glass curtain.|$|R
50|$|As a {{material}} stained <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> <b>glass</b> that has <b>been</b> coloured by adding metallic salts during its manufacture. The coloured <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> crafted into {{stained glass windows}} in which small pieces of <b>glass</b> <b>are</b> arranged to form patterns or pictures, held together (traditionally) by strips of lead and supported by a rigid frame. Painted details and yellow stain are often used to enhance the design. The term stained <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> also applied to windows in which the colours have been painted onto the glass and then fused to the glass in a kiln.|$|R
25|$|Neon {{lighting}} {{is closely related}} to fluorescent lighting, which developed about 25 years after neon tube lighting. In fluorescent lights, the light emitted by rarefied gases within a tube is used exclusively to excite fluorescent materials that coat the tube, which then shine with their own colors that become the tube's visible, usually white, glow. Fluorescent coatings and <b>glasses</b> <b>are</b> also an option for neon tube lighting, but are usually selected to obtain bright colors.|$|E
25|$|In superhero fiction, {{eyeglasses}} {{have become}} a standard component of various heroes' disguises (as masks), allowing them to adopt a nondescript demeanor {{when they are not}} in their superhero persona: Superman is well known for wearing 1950s style horn-rimmed glasses as Clark Kent, while Wonder Woman wears either round, Harold Lloyd style glasses or 1970s style bug-eye glasses as Diana Prince. An example of the halo effect is seen in the stereotype that those who wear <b>glasses</b> <b>are</b> intelligent.|$|E
25|$|Sunglasses or sun <b>glasses</b> <b>are</b> {{a visual}} aid which feature lenses that are {{coloured}} or darkened to prevent strong light {{from reaching the}} eyes. For centuries, Chinese judges had routinely worn smoke-colored quartz lenses to conceal their eye expressions in court. However, these were not intended for blocking sunlight from eyes. It wasn't until the 20th century that what is now considered to be sunglasses were invented. In 1929, Sam Foster invented and mass-produced the first tinted eyewear pieces solely intended to block out sunlight.|$|E
50|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>was</b> used to {{incorporate}} into the bands of slate. The <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> 15 cm thick and was cut and installed by the Architectural Glass Department at Swansea Institute of Higher Education. <b>Glass</b> <b>is</b> {{not used in}} the contemporary British architectural style of the glass curtain.|$|R
50|$|Formulas for {{different}} colors of <b>glass</b> <b>are</b> closely guarded. The {{recipe for a}} true black <b>glass</b> <b>was</b> lost during World War I, and modern black glass held to sunlight is a deep purple. Examples of true black <b>glass</b> <b>are</b> circulating in jewelry pieces made to commemorate the funeral of Queen Victoria.|$|R
5000|$|Low-dispersion <b>glass</b> (LD <b>glass)</b> <b>is</b> a type {{of glass}} with low dispersion. Crown <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> {{an example of a}} {{relatively}} inexpensive low-dispersion glass.|$|R
25|$|Evidence {{discovered}} {{at the crime}} scene suggested the victim's body had been placed {{in the back seat of}} a car, then driven to the disposal location, where her body was dragged out of the car and around the trunk of the vehicle, then rolled down the ravine. Furthermore, on November 21, a pair of Liberty brand glasses belonging to a nearsighted individual were found approximately 50 feet (18 m) from the location where the victim's body had been placed in the ravine, although it remains inconclusive whether these <b>glasses</b> <b>are</b> related to the case.|$|E
25|$|Yellow tinted <b>glasses</b> <b>are</b> a type {{of glasses}} with a minor yellow tint. They perform minor color correction, on top of {{reducing}} headaches {{due to lack of}} blinking. They may also be considered minor corrective unprescribed glasses. Depending on the company, these computer or gaming glasses can also filter out high energy blue and ultra-violet light from LCD screens, fluorescent lighting, and other sources of light. This allows for reduced eye-strain. These glasses can be ordered as standard or prescription lenses that fit into standard optical frames. Due to the ultra-violet light blocking nature of these lenses, they also help users sleep at night along with reducing age-related macular degeneration.|$|E
25|$|On 28 September 2010, Virgin Media {{announced}} {{the launch of}} 3D Movies on Demand – the first commercially available 3D TV service in the UK. All Virgin Media TV customers, with either a V HD, V+ or TiVo box, 3D TV and <b>glasses,</b> <b>are</b> able to experience 3D Movies on Demand. The launch of 3D Movies on Demand, powered by FilmFlex, initially featured StreetDance 3D, Garfield's Pet Force 3D, A Christmas Carol 3D, Step Up 3D and Despicable Me 3D. Virgin Media also announced an exclusive 3D TV partnership with Samsung Electronics which would see Samsung 3D TVs featured in Virgin Media stores {{as well as other}} joint 3D showcases and marketing opportunities.|$|E
50|$|<b>Glass</b> floors <b>are</b> {{made with}} {{transparent}} <b>glass</b> when it <b>is</b> useful to view something from above or below; whereas translucent <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> used {{when there is}} no need to view through. In either case, toughened <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> usually chosen, for its durability and resistance to breakage.|$|R
50|$|Chemically {{strengthened}} <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> a type {{of glass}} that has increased strength. When broken it still shatters in long pointed splinters similar to float (annealed) glass. For this reason, it is not considered a safety <b>glass</b> and must <b>be</b> laminated if a safety <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> required. Chemically strengthened <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> typically six to eight times the strength of annealed glass.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most popular}} <b>glass</b> for {{lampworking}} <b>is</b> soda-lime <b>glass,</b> which <b>is</b> available pre-colored. Soda-lime <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> the traditional mix used in blown furnace glass, and lampworking <b>glass</b> rods <b>were</b> originally hand-drawn from the furnace {{and allowed to}} cool for use by lampworkers. Today soda-lime, or [...] "soft" [...] <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> manufactured globally, including Italy, Germany, Czech Republic, China and America.|$|R
25|$|Galli cricket, which {{literally}} means lane cricket, {{is a type}} of {{the backyard}} cricket popular in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, except that it is often played on the busy narrow inner lanes, and sometimes even on the main roads, of the suburbs and cities, shared with pedestrians, rickshaws, vehicular traffic, cows, pets and stray animals with cacophony of sights, sounds and colors. It is often played with the soft tennis ball, improvised wickets and bat, where rules are flexible, and hitting in the air or the to the wall, specially on someone's window pane glass is considered out. Kids would often get a scolding from the neighbors whose window pane <b>glasses</b> <b>are</b> broken, thus scoring rules are designed to keep the ball on the ground.|$|E
25|$|In pre-Medieval {{times it}} is {{believed}} that the batch of raw materials was heated to a temperature where it partially melted, the unmelted parts removed and washed of non-reactive components, and added to the next batch. Because of the strong way that the Si/Na/Ca compositions affect the melting temperature, the resulting glass was of a fairly uniform composition regardless of the recipe of raw materials used. The melting temperatures of the Si/K/Ca <b>glasses</b> <b>are</b> not so strongly affected by composition, resulting in glasses of more varied composition, so the self-limiting features of the Na system that allowed the traditional partial-batch method to produce consistent compositions, ceased to apply, and a new way of controlling consistency had to be developed. The wide variety of compositions, together with historical accounts of glassmaking, suggest that the new method involved melting a complete batch of raw materials, removing the unreactive components as scum.|$|E
25|$|The {{formulation}} of glasses using lead, alumina, and thallium to increase RI and dispersion {{began in the}} late Baroque period. These <b>glasses</b> <b>are</b> fashioned into brilliants, and when freshly cut they can be surprisingly effective diamond simulants. Known as rhinestones, pastes, or strass, glass simulants are a common feature of antique jewelry; in such cases, rhinestones can be valuable historical artifacts in their own right. The great softness (below hardness 6) imparted by the lead means a rhinestone's facet edges and faces will quickly become rounded and scratched. Together with conchoidal fractures, and air bubbles or flow lines within the stone, these features make glass imitations easy to spot under only moderate magnification. In contemporary production it is more common for glass to be molded rather than cut into shape: in these stones the facets will be concave and facet edges rounded, and mold marks or seams may also be present. Glass has also been combined with other materials to produce composites.|$|E
40|$|The {{physical}} and thermal properties Of P 2 O 5 -Al 2 O 3 -BaO-La 2 O 3 <b>glasses</b> <b>were</b> investigated. The effects of glass compositions on the transition temperature, thermal expansion coefficient, density, hardness and refractive index of <b>glasses</b> <b>were</b> studied. The highest hardness of the <b>glasses</b> <b>is</b> 4143. 891 MPa {{and the lowest}} thermal expansion coefficient of the <b>glasses</b> <b>is</b> 71. 770 x 10 (- 7) /&DEG; C. A phosphate glass with high mechanical strength and good thermal characteristic is obtained...|$|R
30|$|Transparent sodium {{silicate}} glass, manufactured in a {{float glass process}} on liquid tin and with local prints of ceramic frit was evaluated. Three different surfaces of the <b>glasses</b> <b>were</b> studied, the tin side that during the manufacturing process was {{in contact with the}} tin bath, the fire side that was exposed to the atmosphere and a ceramic frit surface printed on the fire side. Three different automotive <b>glasses</b> <b>were</b> studied {{in the first part of}} the project and the results were then verified on a demonstrator. The first two <b>glasses</b> <b>were</b> a reference <b>glass</b> and a similar from another batch manufactured in Europe of Belgian sand. The third <b>glass</b> <b>was</b> a similar <b>glass</b> but manufactured in China from local sand. In the final part a demonstrator <b>glass</b> <b>was</b> used, a European windscreen similar to the reference. The <b>glasses</b> <b>were</b> provided by Sekurit Saint Gobain (Herzogenrath, Germany). All sides of <b>glass</b> <b>were</b> initially evaluated, but the tin and ceramic side where the most difficult to bond to and are therefore the focus here.|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} making Murano <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> rather complex. The <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> made from silica, which becomes liquid at high temperatures. As the glass passes from a liquid to a solid state, there is an {{interval}} when the <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> soft before it hardens completely. This is when the glass-master can shape the material.|$|R
