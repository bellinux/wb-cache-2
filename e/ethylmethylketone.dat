Markéta Kráčalíková Title of rigorous thesis: The {{study of}} the influence of terbinafine on glass transition temperature of polyester matrices Consultant: PharmDr. Eva Šnejdrová, Ph. D. ABSTRAKT This rigorous thesis deals with the {{study of the}} influence of terbinafine concentration on the glass transition temperature of polyester matrices. In this thesis were used linear polyester of D,L-lactic and glycolic acid (PLGA) and the polyester branched with tripentaerythritol (3 T), which were synthesized in the Department of Pharmaceutical Technology Faculty of Pharmacy in Hradec Králové. It was used drug of terbinafine base. For incorporation of the drug into the polyester carrier it was chosen the method of dissolving in a suitable solvent. The solvent was <b>ethylmethylketone.</b> The theoretical part is focused on the solubility of drugs, description and use of classes BCS classification system, Lipinski rules of three five and characteristics, effects and use of terbinafine. In the experimental part the glass transition temperature of the polyester matrices with different terbinafine concentrations prepared by dissolving of polymer and drug in <b>ethylmethylketone</b> and [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{methacrylamide}} monomer, N-(p-bromophenyl) - 2 -methacrylamide (PBPMA) was synthesized by reacting p-bromoaniline {{dissolved in}} <b>ethylmethylketone</b> (EMK) with methacryloyl chloride {{in the presence}} of triethylamine. The copolymers of PBPMA with N-Vinyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (NVP) were synthesized by free radical solution polymerization using EMK as a solvent at 70  ±  1  °C and benzoyl peroxide as a free radical initiator. The copolymerization behavior was studied in a wide composition interval with the mole fractions of PBPMA ranging from 0. 20 to 0. 80 in the feed. The copolymers were characterized by FT-IR, 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR and GPC. The solubility was tested in various polar and non polar solvents. The thermogravimetric analysis of the polymers showed that the thermal stability of the copolymer increases with PBPMA content. The copolymer composition was determined by elemental analysis. The monomer reactivity ratios were determined by the application of conventional linearization methods such as Fineman–Ross, Kelen–Tudos methods, and a non-linear error-in-variable model (EVM) method using a computer program...|$|E

D. Diploma thesis {{deals with the}} formulation and evaluation of solid dispersions based on biodegradable polymeric carriers: (i) a linear copolymer of D, L-lactic acid and glycolic acid in a ratio of 1 : 1 and (ii) a polyester of D, L-lactic and glycolic acids branched on central molecule of tripentaerythritol. Active substances (salicylic acid, miconazole) were incorporated by dissolution and evaporation of the solvent (<b>ethylmethylketone),</b> or by melting method. Liberation and thermal properties of solid dispersions were evaluated. Theoretical part deals with methods of incorporation of the drug into the polymeric carriers, polymer-drug interactions, and medicinal preparations containing salicylic acid and miconazole. The results of thermal analysis of the solid dispersions demonstrated {{the absence of an}} amorphous or crystalline state of the drugs. We conclude that the drugs are molecularly dispersed in the polymeric carriers. Addition of 5 % salicylic acid occurs mild decrease in glass transition temperature, [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{technological}} parameters of preparation of biodegradable polyester nanoparticles on their size parameter was studied with PCS method. Nanoparticles containing terbinafine incorporated in branched polyester of aliphatic hydroxyl-acids. They were prepared by method of distribution <b>ethylmethylketone</b> as a solvent into the external phase of emulsion. It {{was found that}} the relation between the concentration of the emulsion, polyester concentration and concentrations of terbinafine in the internal phase of emulsion and the size of nanoparticles is not clear, a number of factors involve, such as collisions during dispersion, distribution speed of the solvent and viscosity. These factors can have opposite effects on the size parameters of nanoparticles. During storage of nanodispersions changes are made in the parameters of size distribution of nanoparticles affected by distribution of the solvents, swelling and erosion of carrier. After the addition of substances that reduce the polarity of the external phase of nanodispersion, the process of distribution is more intensive. Glycine, added to the outer phase as a carrier of nanoparticles during their drying, causes aggregation of nanoparticles without drug by linking of the terminal carboxyl of the carrier. With the presence of terbinafine in [...] ...|$|E
