6000|$|... "I am {{considerably}} {{older than}} you," [...] he went on, [...] "and I have {{the future of}} St. John's very much at heart, Mr. Hodder. I trust you will remember this and make allowances for it as <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it was I. This happens very charmingly, for I {{feel as if}} it {{were for}} me <b>to</b> give <b>you</b> a formal {{reception}} here, an official welcome. <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> so much about Europe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{now let me}} look at <b>you,</b> Monsieur Rupert. <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> last night, but I did not fairly look at you. Yes, you {{are really}} very little altered except that you have grown into a man: but I should have known you anywhere. Now, would you have known me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay," [...] quoth Robin, laughing. [...] "I {{would not}} check thy thirst, sweet friend; drink while <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>thee.</b> Thus it is: I would have thee know that I {{have taken a}} liking to thy craft and would fain have a taste of a beggar's life mine own self." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not if I had met {{you in the}} street," [...] Rupert said. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> {{and look}} at you closely, Mademoiselle Adele Dessin comes back again; but at a casual glance you are simply Mademoiselle Adele de Pignerolles." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{arrived at}} six o'clock," [...] the {{ambassador}} declared. [...] "It went {{straight into the}} inner pocket of my coat; {{it has not been}} out of my possession for a single second. Even whilst <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> I can feel it." ...|$|E
6000|$|And he {{answered}} them and said, 'I {{will talk to}} you about all other things that are in heaven and on earth, but about God I will not talk to you. Neither now, nor at any time, will <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about God.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I thought you--a prig," [...] she recollected. [...] "No; that's {{not quite}} it. There were the ants who stole the tongue, and I thought you and St. John were like those ants--very big, very ugly, very energetic, {{with all your}} virtues on your backs. However, when <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> liked you--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jerusalem!" [...] the miner exclaimed. [...] "What on airth {{are they}} doing there? Why, we thought they had gone down {{to the west of}} the Colorado. I told you so, chief, when <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about it; and instead of that, here they are up in the country of the 'Rappahoes and Shoshones." ...|$|R
6000|$|With little {{here to do}} or see [...] Of {{things that}} in the great world be, [...] Sweet Daisy! oft <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>thee,</b> [...] For thou art worthy, [...] Thou unassuming Common-place [...] Of Nature, with that homely face, [...] And yet with {{something}} of a grace, [...] Which Love makes for thee! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We are not small men," [...] Stephen Weiss said slowly. [...] "We {{represent}} a great power, and a power {{for which we}} mean to fight. When <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> of money, I mean it. We will raise a million dollars for you before midday to-morrow, if you leave that paper in our hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Upon my word, my love,' said Mrs Lammle, 'you make me {{ten times}} more desirous, now <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> to know you well than I was when I sat over yonder looking at you. How I wish we could be real friends! Try me as a real friend. Come! Don't fancy me a frumpy old married woman, my dear; I was married but the other day, you know; I am dressed as a bride now, you see. About the chimney-sweeps?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{much that}} I deem holy, {{and for that}} I fear no laughter. I am ready to defy ridicule. But if <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> of the asceticism of Stylites, {{and tell you that}} I admire it, and will imitate it, will you not then laugh at me? Of course we ridicule what we think is false. But ridicule will run off truth like water from a duck's back. Come, explain to me this about the resurrection of the body." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not!" [...] said Mrs. Jackson. [...] "I {{come here}} because my {{conscience}} tells me to. What <b>I</b> wish <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about concerns us all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Havin' {{a little}} baby {{in the house is}} {{different}} from a big boy like you, Dan. There's no use for us to stand here chinnin' about it. I'm ready to say I'm sorry for the way <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> yesterday, an' I'll 'gree never to go back to aunt Dorcas's. Now, what more can I do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|With little {{here to do}} or see [...] Of {{things that}} in the great world be, [...] Daisy! again <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>thee,</b> [1] [...] For thou art worthy, [...] Thou unassuming Common-place [...] 5 [...] Of Nature, with that homely face, [...] And yet with {{something}} of a grace, [...] Which Love makes for thee! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{exactly what}} I {{wanted to talk}} to you about," [...] she said, seizing the {{opportunity}} offered by this display of humility. [...] "I've been looking for you all day to go on with what I was starting to say in the lift last night when we were interrupted. Do you mind if <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> like an aunt--or a sister, suppose we say? Really, the best plan would be for you to adopt me as an honorary sister. What do you think?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Trafford thought. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> I've {{always felt}} I mustn't be too vague. And {{the very essence}} of all this is a vague thing, {{something}} we shall never come nearer to it in all our lives than to see it as a shadow and a glittering that escapes again into a mist.... And yet it's everything that matters, everything, {{the only thing that matters}} truly and for ever through the whole range of life. And we have to serve it with the keenest thought, the utmost patience, inordinate veracity....|$|E
6000|$|... "And I {{thought you}} were a man of sentiment!" [...] Dominey scoffed. [...] "I thought you {{understood}} a little of human nature. Stephanie Eiderstrom is Hungarian born and bred. Even race has never taught her self-restraint. You don't seriously suppose that after all these years, after all she has suffered--and she has suffered--{{she is going to be}} content with an emasculated form of friendship? <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> without reserve, Seaman. She has made it very plain to-night that she is going to be content with nothing of the sort." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> cannot <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> {{any more}} to-day. Take that rose-crystal away {{with you and}} think.|$|R

6000|$|... "I beg a {{thousand}} pardons, dear Sister: {{in these three}} long pages <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> of nothing but my troubles and affairs. A strange abuse it would be of any other person's friendship. But yours, my dear Sister, yours is known to me; and I am persuaded you are not impatient when I open my heart to you:--a heart which is yours altogether; being filled with sentiments of the tenderest esteem, with which I am, my dearest Sister, your [in truth, affectionate Brother at all times] F." [...] [OEuvres de Frederic, xxvii. i. 294, 295, 296-298.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, Will--you are a flippant young fool--wise in {{your own}} conceit; I say it to my sorrow! 'Twas your {{dishonesty}} spoilt all. That lady would have been my wife by fair dealing--time was all I required. But base attacks on a man's character never deserve to win, and if I had once been certain that you had made them, my course {{would have been very}} different, both towards you and others. But why should <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about this? If I cared an atom what becomes of you I would take you in hand severely enough; not caring, I leave you alone, to go to the devil your own way.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't {{know why}} <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> as I do, Lady Harman, but I don't {{seem to mind}} talking to you. I don't suppose I've {{opened my mouth to}} anyone about it, not for years--except to one dear friend I've got--her who persuaded me to be a church member. But what I've always said and what I will always say is this, that I don't believe any evil of Father, I don't believe, I won't ever believe he took his life. I won't even believe he was in drink. I don't know how he got in the river, but I'm certain it wasn't so. He was a weak man, was Father, I've never denied he was a weak man. But a harder working man than he was never lived. He worried, anyone would have worried seeing the worries he had. The shop wasn't paying as it was; often we never tasted meat for weeks together, and then there came one of these Internationals, giving {{overweight}} and underselling...." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{am going}} to ask you a very great favor, Mabel. When we are alone together, <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> with {{absolute}} freedom. To write you on matters connected with my office is different. I know very well how deep and sincere your interest in politics really is, and it has always been one of my greatest pleasures, when with you, to talk things over and hear your point of view. Without flattery, dear, I have really more than once found your advice useful. It is your understanding which makes our companionship always a pleasure to me, and I rely upon that when I beg you not to ask me to write you again on matters to which I have really no right to allude. You do not mind this, dear? And having read you my little lecture, I will answer your question. Yes, the Cabinet Council was held exactly as you surmise. With great difficulty I persuaded B---- to adopt my view of the situation. They are all much too terrified of this war bogey. For once I had my own way. Our answer to this latest demand from Berlin was a prompt and decisive negative. Nothing of this is to be known for at least a week.|$|E

Theoretically only, {{on foreign}} territory; abroad {{only by a}} fiction,” said the Assistant Commissioner, {{alluding}} {{to the character of}} Embassies, which are supposed to be {{part and parcel of the}} country to which they belong. “But that’s a detail. <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> of this business because it’s your government that grumbles most at our police. You see that we are not so bad. I wanted particularly <b>to</b> tell <b>you</b> of our success.” ...|$|R
