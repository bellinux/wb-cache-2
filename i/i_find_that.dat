5|$|I {{feel that}} {{talking about it}} trivializes it. I've been {{studying}} the Cabala , which is the mystical interpretation of the Torah. I've studied Buddhism and Hinduism and I've been practising yoga and obviously I {{know a lot about}} Catholicism. There are indisputable truths that connect all of them, and <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> very comforting and kind. My spiritual journey is to be open to everything. Pay attention to what makes sense, be absorbed. For me, yoga is the closest thing to our real nature.|$|E
25|$|Although Tsar Peter the Great {{introduced}} the Idea of Progress to Russia, by the 19th century, the Tsars {{did not recognize}} “progress” as a legitimate aim of the state, {{to the degree that}} Nicholas II said “How repulsive <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> word” and wished it removed from the Russian language.|$|E

25|$|Arriving at Oxford {{just after}} the September 11 attacks, Clinton was drawn to other American {{students}} who were also feeling the emotional after-effects of the trauma. She told Talk magazine:Every day I encounter some sort of anti-American feeling. Over the summer, I thought I would seek out non-Americans as friends, just for diversity's sake. Now <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> I {{want to be around}} Americans – people who I know are thinking about our country as much as I am.|$|E
25|$|I {{frequently}} have differed with {{the opinions of}} Dr. Sylvanus G. Morley. This is easily {{explained by the fact}} that he is one of the few archaeologists who have studied the hieroglyphs of Chichen Itza. While I agree with his results on the inscriptions of the Old Empire cities which contain many dates and time periods, <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> his method of dealing solely with calendrical matter fails at Chichen Itza, since there are but few hieroglyphs of that nature.|$|E

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> {{while the}} Catholic {{population}} has increased a third, the churches and priests have doubled in number. In 1854 {{there was no}} religious community. Now we have a monastery of Benedictines, another of Passionists, a mother-house of Sisters of Charity, conducting seventeen different establishments; two convents of Benedictine nuns, two others of German Sisters of Notre Dame and two others of the Sisters of the Poor of St. Francis. In 1854 there was no institution of learning; to-day we have a flourishing college and a diocesan seminary, an academy for young ladies, a boarding school for boys, and parish schools attached to almost all the parishes.|$|E
500|$|Lafcadio Hearn (1850–1904) {{asserted}} that [...] "For tetanus cockroach tea is given. I {{do not know}} how many cockroaches go to make up the cup; but <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> faith in this remedy is strong among many of the American population of New Orleans. A poultice of boiled cockroaches is placed over the wound." [...] He adds that cockroaches are eaten, fried with garlic, for indigestion.|$|E
500|$|Madgwick {{was usually}} {{on good terms}} with Hulme, {{although}} like with Darling they sometimes disagreed {{on the content of}} ABC's current affairs shows, especially This Day Tonight (TDT). Hulme frequently passed-on complaints of bias in TDT's coverage from Holt's government in Canberra, each of which Madgwick dutifully investigated. Said Madgwick, [...] "On no occasion did <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> the programme had been consciously biased one way or another." ...|$|E
5000|$|Smell is also vividly {{represented}} {{throughout the}} novel. The young Riad associates new places and especially new {{people with their}} smells, ranging from perfume and incense to sweat, spoiled food, and flatulence. These odors tend to convey the quality of relationships, with Sattouf explaining, [...] "the people whose odor I preferred were generally {{the ones who were}} the kindest to me. <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>that’s</b> still true today.” ...|$|R

500|$|In an October 2012 interview, Hawke {{said that}} he prefers great art over politics, {{explaining}} that his preference shows [...] "how little" [...] he cares about the latter; [...] "I think about the first people of our generation to do great art. I see Michael Chabon write a great book; when I see Philip Seymour Hoffman do Death of a Salesman last year—I see people of my generation being fully realized in their work, and <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> really kind of exciting. But politics? I don't know. Paul Ryan is certainly not my man." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Waters {{was born}} in Pembrokeshire, Wales, she {{considers}} herself a London writer because of her intense affection for the city, {{due in part to}} her immigration to it. Specifically, Waters is moved by walking through London and seeing remnants of many historical eras: [...] "It's ... almost like it's peopled with ghosts—again, jostling up against each other or passing through each other. <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> very exciting." [...] Her love for the city is apparent to many reviewers. In the Lesbian Review of Books Donna Allegra writes, [...] "he summons the era's attitudes and ambiance projecting them onto the screen of the reader's mind with Dolby wrap-around sound such that you feel you're vacationing on all points between Chelsea and the East End." ...|$|E
500|$|As David remarked in this section, her {{approach}} to measuring out ingredients {{had changed since}} her early days: [...] "By temperament a non-measurer, I have myself, first through the wish to communicate recipes and now by force of habit, become the reverse. <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> the discipline of weighing and measuring does one's cooking nothing but good, provided that one does not waste time messing about with quarter-saltspoons and five-eighths of pints, nor, above all, expect that precision will eliminate the necessity to keep one's head or train one's eye and palate." [...] The author does not conceal her dislike for some much-used herbs: sage [...] "deadens the food with its musty dried blood scent" [...] and rosemary [...] "acrid taste … the spiky little leaves get stuck between your teeth." ...|$|E

500|$|As Cotton's {{theology}} changed, {{he began}} placing {{less emphasis on}} preparation ("works") to obtain God's salvation, and more emphasis on the [...] "transforming character of the moment of religious conversion in which mortal man [...] infused with a divine grace." [...] His theology was molded {{by a number of}} individuals, besides influences such as Perkins and Sibbes; his basic tenets stemmed from reformer John Calvin. [...] At one point he wrote, [...] "I have read the fathers, and the schoolmen and Calvin too, but <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> he that has Calvin has them all." [...] Other inspirations to his theology, as revealed in his writings, include the models of the Apostle Paul and Bishop Cyprian, and reformation leaders Zacharias Ursinus, Theodore Beza, Franciscus Junius, Jerome Zanchius, Peter Martyr, Johannes Piscator, and Martin Bucer. [...] Additional English role models include Paul Baynes, Thomas Cartwright, Laurence Chaderton, Arthur Hildersham, William Ames, William Whitaker, John Jewel, and John Whitgift.|$|E
500|$|Agnew's first {{marriage}} was to Beverley in 1983; it {{ended in divorce}} in 1992, a year after he became BBC cricket correspondent. He has written about the role that cricket played {{in the collapse of}} the relationship, comparing his circumstances with those of then England batsman Graham Thorpe. He also found that his job interfered with his relationship with his children: I had two young children, aged seven and five... it was quickly evident that for me to have custody of my daughters – or even to form a relationship with them – was made impossible by my job. What chance do you have when, be it playing Test cricket or commentating on it, you are away {{for months at a time}} each and every winter?... There was one occasion when I did not recognise my eldest, Jennifer, when I returned from one tour... my children continue to ask me why I did not resign and take a job that would have kept me in the country and allowed me to see them more often. <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> one especially hard to answer." [...] Agnew has subsequently remarried: he met Emma Agnew, current editor of BBC East Midlands Today, when they worked together on BBC Radio Leicestershire.|$|E
500|$|Meyer {{has been}} {{particularly}} well received by female Holby City fans, elevating Irving to sex-symbol status. The Dail Mail Lynda Lee-Potter described him as [...] "devastatingly attractive, brusque and autocratic" [...] and [...] "the kind of domineering, unsmiling hero who made Mills & Boon heroines swoon." [...] Irving {{felt that this was}} [...] "fairly predictable in terms of the nature of Meyer–tough and masterful–combined with the aphrodisiac of power, and the life and death aspects of his job." [...] He commented that he was surprised by the positive reaction to his character, explaining: [...] "He seems to have captured people's imaginations, but it's difficult to put your finger on what he has. I think it's got something to do with being a character who says exactly what he means all the time. He's got integrity, which I admire anyway, and I expect the audience responds to that. Surgeons seem to like him too. <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> particularly gratifying. He's got the courage to do what's right for his work and his patients and not worry about popularity or being liked." [...] Conversely, Irving noted that after assuming the role, members of the public would sometimes [...] "give a kind of shudder" [...] upon encountering him, associating him with his character.|$|E

2500|$|Israeli lawyer Charles Abelsohn {{criticized the}} {{objectivity}} {{of the committee}} members, citing Travers who said during the public hearings that [...] "there have been instances of the shooting of children {{in front of their}} parents. As an ex-soldier <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> kind of action to be very, very strange and very unique", asking the witness to comment on those insights.|$|E
2500|$|Lincoln {{agreed and}} pledged, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> {{men have been}} {{pursuing}} the Smiths, I will lay my long hand upon them, no matter who they are." [...] He then ordered that the court-martial be conducted in Boston and asked Navy Secretary Welles to send him the trial record at the conclusion for his review. Welles was told to delay execution of the sentence until the president gave his approval.|$|E
2500|$|In 1612, Cotton left a {{tutoring}} {{position at}} Emmanuel College, Cambridge {{and became the}} minister at Saint Botolph's Church in Boston, Lincolnshire. He was only 27 years old, yet he {{was considered one of}} the leading Puritans in England due to his learned and vigorous preaching. His theology was influenced by English Puritan Richard Sibbes, but his basic tenets were from John Calvin. [...] At one point he wrote, [...] "I have read the fathers, and the schoolmen and Calvin too, but <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> he that has Calvin has them all." ...|$|E
