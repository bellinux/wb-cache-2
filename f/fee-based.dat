5|$|Friedrich Christian Accum or Frederick Accum (March 29, 1769 – June 28, 1838) was a German chemist, {{whose most}} {{important}} achievements included {{advances in the}} field of gas lighting, efforts to keep processed foods free from dangerous additives, and the promotion of interest in the science of chemistry to the general populace. From 1793 to 1821 Accum lived in London. Following an apprenticeship as an apothecary, he opened his own commercial laboratory enterprise. His business manufactured and sold a variety of chemicals and laboratory equipment. Accum, himself, gave <b>fee-based</b> public lectures in practical chemistry and collaborated with research efforts at numerous other institutes of science.|$|E
5|$|During Straits Settlements times, cases {{pertaining}} to Singapore appeared in various privately produced and official series of law reports such as Kyshe's Reports (covering cases decided between 1808 and 1939), the Straits Law Journal (1839–1891) and the Straits Settlements Law Reports (1867–1942). From 1932 until 1992, Singapore cases appeared {{regularly in the}} Malayan Law Journal (MLJ), the only local series of law reports published continuously since the 1930s, except during World War II. The MLJ is still consulted for Singapore cases decided prior to full independence in 1965. Since 1992, judgments of the High Court, Court of Appeal and Constitutional Tribunal of Singapore {{have appeared in the}} Singapore Law Reports (SLR), which is published by the Singapore Academy of Law under an exclusive licence from the Supreme Court of Singapore. The Academy has also republished cases decided since Singapore's full independence in 1965 that appeared in the MLJ in special volumes of the SLR, and {{is currently working on a}} reissue of this body of case law.

5|$|Most early St. Louisans {{remained}} illiterate {{through the}} 1810s, although many wealthy merchants purchased books for private libraries. Early schools in St. Louis were all <b>fee-based</b> and mostly conducted lessons in French. The first substantial educational effort came about {{under the authority}} of the Catholic Church, which in 1818 opened Saint Louis Academy, later renamed Saint Louis University. In 1832, the college applied for a state charter, and in December 1832, it became the first chartered university west of the Mississippi River. Its medical school opened in 1842, with faculty that included Daniel Brainard (founder of Rush Medical College), Moses Linton (founder of the first medical journal west of the Mississippi River in 1843), and Charles Alexander Pope (later president of the American Medical Association). However, the university primarily catered to seminary students rather than the general public, and only in the 1840s did the Catholic Church offer large scale instruction at parochial schools. In 1853, William Greenleaf Eliot founded a second university in the city – Washington University in St. Louis. During the 1850s Eliot founded Smith Academy for boys and Mary Institute for girls, which later merged and became Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School.|$|E

These range from MMORPG to first-person shooters, from role-playing video games to online gambling. While online gaming has been around since the 1970s, modern modes of online gaming began with subscription services such as GameSpy and MPlayer. Non-subscribers were limited to certain types of game play or certain games. Many people use the Internet to access and download music, movies and other works for their enjoyment and relaxation.

2500|$|As Singapore is {{a common}} law jurisdiction, judgements handed down by the courts are {{considered}} a source of law. Judgements may interpret statutes or subsidiary legislation, or develop principles of common law and equity which have been laid down, not by the legislature, but by previous generations of judges. Major portions of Singapore law, particularly contract law, equity and trust law, property law and tort law, are largely judge-made, though certain aspects have now been modified to some extent by statutes.

The sticker allows those permit-holders who can find a safe space in the public right-of-way to store a car for three days with exemption from the posted parking restrictions, which are two hours in most areas, reducing cold starts and resulting vehicle emissions.|$|E
2500|$|Some <b>FEE-based</b> {{analyses}} {{suggest that}} the famine {{was a result of}} policy failure or bungling. Others assert that prioritised distribution and the denial policies reflected the War Cabinet's callous willingness to [...] "supply the Army's needs and let the Indian people starve if necessary" [...] when weighing how to allocate wartime resources. In this view, economic policies were designed to serve externally oriented British military goals at the expense of internally oriented Indian interests, and so the UK government bears moral responsibility for the rural deaths. [...] The policies may have met their intended goals, but only at the cost of harrowing, large-scale dislocations in the domestic economy. Far from being accidental, this argument maintains, these dislocations were fully recognised beforehand as fatal for identifiable Indian groups whose economic activities did not directly, actively, or adequately advance military goals. The analysts split into two broad camps: those who think the government unwittingly caused or was unable to respond to the crisis, and those who think it willfully ignored the plight of starving Indians. The former see the problem as a series of avoidable war-time policy failures and [...] "panicky responses" [...] from a government that was spectacularly inept, overwhelmed and in disarray, the latter as a conscious miscarriage of justice by the [...] "ruling colonial elite" [...] who abandoned the poor of Bengal.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, Phantasy Star Online on the Dreamcast {{introduced}} online gaming to consoles and {{was responsible}} for pushing console gamers [...] "to dial up with the Dreamcast to play online and to experience a new style of play." [...] It resulted in taking [...] "consoles online" [...] and defining [...] "small-scale multiplayer RPGs," [...] {{paving the way for}} larger-scale MMORPG efforts such as Final Fantasy XI, setting the template for small-scale online RPGs such as Capcom's Monster Hunter series and some of the later Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy games, and giving rise to [...] "an entire pantheon of multiplayer dungeon crawlers that continue to dominate the Japanese sales charts." [...] More generally, Phantasy Star Online made [...] "both online gaming and the concept of <b>fee-based</b> services a reality for consoles," [...] paving the way for the online gaming services later provided by all three of the seventh-generation consoles. That same year, Vagrant Story introduced a pausable real-time battle system based on targeting individual body parts, using both melee and bow & arrow weapons; similar body-targeting battle systems were later used in Bethesda's Fallout 3 (2008) and Nippon Ichi's Last Rebellion (2010). That year also saw the release of the PlayStation 2, which would become the best-selling game console of all time, {{due in large part to}} its large variety of Japanese RPGs (including franchises such as Final Fantasy, Grandia, and Tales) that established its dominance over the RPG market.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Fee-based</b> consultants, some {{available}} entirely online, can {{be hired}} {{to help a}} student gain admission to the so-called right schools, {{although there are some}} free programs to help underprivileged youth learn how to fill out applications, write essays, get ready for tests, and work on interviews. Consultants can help a student select schools to apply to, counsel them on test taking strategies, review scores, help with essay preparation (but not writing), review applications, conduct mock interviews, provide logistical planning, and collaborate with others such as athletic coaches. Consultants try to keep a low profile; however, one admissions dean explained that she can [...] "sniff out when there has been some adult involved in the process". Assistance by consultants or other adults can go to extremes, particularly with hard-to-check variables such as the college essays; according to one view, plagiarism on admissions essays has been a [...] "serious problem", particularly on applications to private universities and colleges. There is the possibility that hiring a professional admissions consultant can make an application appear artificial; for example, admissions personnel may suspect adult coaching when one part of an application is polished, while other parts aren't, such as varying quality regarding writing samples. Another risk in hiring a consultant, which can happen if parents become too involved in the process, is what Mamlet and VanDeVelde term overpackaging: the applicant appears so smooth and perfect that admissions officers suspect the person is not real but a marketing creation. Generally, when hiring a college admissions counselor, parents and students try to understand the counselor's philosophy, learn what services are provided, and whether any help will be offered regarding advice about financial aid or scholarships. Mamlet and VanDeVelde suggest that it is improper for an admissions counselor to tamper with a student's [...] "authentic self". According to their view, ideal counselors have experience with college admissions, meet regularly with college admissions officers, visit campuses regularly, and belong to professional affiliations.|$|E
2500|$|... : The US Secretary of the Treasury Lloyd Bentsen {{initially}} {{supported a}} FTT in 1994.

In 2010 he introduced the [...] "Debt Free America Act" [...] (H.R. 4646), that goes further and proposes to enact a 1% FFT and eliminate federal income tax. Both bills never made it out of committee. On 24 September 2009, Paul Volcker (former US Federal Reserve chairman) [...] "said he was 'very interested' by ideas for a tax on transactions between banks". On 3 December 2009, 22 representatives in the United States House of Representatives supported the [...] "Let Wall Street Pay for the Restoration of Main Street Bill", which contained a domestic financial transaction tax. On 7 December 2009, Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the United States House of Representatives stated her support for a [...] "G-20 global tax". However, already on 6 November 2009, US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, following UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown's call for a global FTT, expressed US opposition to the proposal saying: [...] "A day-by-day financial transaction tax is not something we're prepared to support". Instead Geither favors an ongoing levy charged against large banks. On 13 December 2009, Paul Volcker, chairman of the US Economic Recovery Advisory Board under President Barack Obama, said he [...] "instinctively opposed" [...] any tax on financial transactions. [...] "But it may be worthwhile to look into the current proposals as long as the result is not predetermined. That would at least end all this renewed talk about the idea, but overall I am skeptical about these ideas." [...] By 2011, Volcker was more open {{to the idea of a}} transaction tax as a means to slow down trading. According to Ron Suskind, the author of [...] "Confidence Men", a book based on 700 hours of interviews with high-level staff of the US administration, President Obama supported a FTT on trades of stocks, derivatives, and other financial instruments, but it was blocked by Obama's former director of the National Economic Council Larry Summers.|$|E
