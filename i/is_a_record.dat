5|$|Fruit is {{normally}} picked by a perched bird, although there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>record</b> of a mulberry fruit being taken in flight. Garden warblers often feed with conspecifics and other fruit-eating passerines. Over 35 plant {{species have been}} recorded as food for this warbler just in central Europe, with many additional species being consumed in the Mediterranean region and on the African wintering grounds.|$|E

5|$|The EFSF issued €5 {{billion of}} five-year bonds in its inaugural {{benchmark}} issue 25 January 2011, attracting an order book of €44.5 billion. This amount <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>record</b> for any sovereign bond in Europe, and €24.5 {{billion more than}} the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM), a separate European Union funding vehicle, with a €5 billion issue {{in the first week}} of January 2011.|$|E
5|$|After the Fatimid caliphs {{moved to}} Egypt, el-Mansuriya {{remained}} {{the capital of}} the Zirids, who became the local rulers, for the next eighty-five years. The Zirid ruler el-Mansur bin Buluqqin built a palace for himself at el-Mansuriya. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>record</b> of the lavish marriage in 1022-23 of his grandson, the young Zirid el-Muizz bin Badis. Pavilions were built outside the city, a large array of textiles and manufactured good was displayed and music was provided by a great number of instruments. El-Muizz bin Badis, who ruled Ifriqiya under the Fatimids from 1015 to 1062, rebuilt the Kairouan city wall and built two walls {{on either side of the}} road from Kairouan to el-Mansuriya. He ordered the transfer to el-Mansuriya of the crafts and commerce from Kairouan.|$|E
5|$|Alternative Songs <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>record</b> {{chart that}} ranks the most-played songs on American modern rock radio stations. Published {{by the music}} {{industry}} magazine Billboard, it {{was created in the}} midst of the growing popularity of alternative music on rock radio in the late 1980s. As less-established alternative acts were receiving minimal exposure on album-oriented rock (AOR) radio stations, their labels turned to modern rock stations for airplay. Billboard introduced the chart in response to demand within the music industry for consistent information on the commercial performance of alternative music. During the decade, it was known as the Modern Rock Tracks chart and tabulated based on weighted reports from twenty-nine radio stations: eighteen established standard-bearer commercial stations and eleven non-commercial college stations.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{its large}} size and {{formidable}} defenses, The Pacific electric ray seldom falls prey to other animals. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>record</b> of one being fed upon by a killer whale (Orcinus orca) off Santa Catalina Island. The Cooper's nutmeg (Cancellaria cooperi) is a specialized parasite of this ray, and possibly other bottom-dwelling fishes {{such as the}} Pacific angelshark (Squatina californica). The snail is attracted to the chemicals contained in the ray's surface mucus; it makes a small cut on the ventral surface of the ray and uses its proboscis to suck blood. Other known parasites of this species include the copepod Trebius latifurcatus, the fluke Amphibdelloides maccallumi, and the tapeworm Acanthobothrium hispidum.|$|E
5|$|Despite not {{charting}} in Billboard magazine, {{the video}} reached the Top 10 for four consecutive weeks on Terra Networks' Top Music Video countdown. In the music video for the song, Queen is video taped showing sensual scenes by several cameras from different angles. Scenes alternate between a dance {{in a darkened}} room and Queen <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>record</b> studio and the cameras. She is surrounded by multiple computers and flat screen television sets which display the feeds from the cameras.|$|E
5|$|Ethnographies also caution against over-interpretation of sites. At {{a site in}} Chaco Canyon can {{be found}} a {{pictograph}} with a star, crescent and hand. It has been argued by some astronomers that this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>record</b> of the 1054 Supernova. However recent reexaminations of related 'supernova petroglyphs' raises questions about such sites in general and anthropological evidence suggests other inrepretations. The Zuni people, who claim a strong ancestral affiliation with Chaco, marked their sun-watching station with a crescent, star, hand and sundisc, {{similar to those found}} at the Chaco site.|$|E

5|$|For the Narnians, Berger envisioned them as more wild in appearance, as {{they have}} been forced into the forests. He also decided to {{increase}} the portrayal of various ages, sizes and races. The black dwarfs are distinguished from the red dwarfs {{as they have}} more leather and jewellery, and a darker colour scheme in their costumes. Each race of creatures also had their fighting styles made more distinguishable. The minotaurs have maces, and the centaurs use swords. The satyrs were redesigned, as their creation on the first film had been rushed. 4,600 make-up jobs were performed, which Berger believes <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>record.</b>|$|E
5|$|Great {{white sharks}} (Carcharodon carcharias) and killer whales (Orcinus orca) are plausible, albeit undocumented, predators of the porbeagle. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>record</b> {{of a small}} {{individual}} caught off Argentina that bore bite marks from a copper shark (Carcharhinus brachyurus) or similar species, but it is uncertain whether the porbeagle {{was the target of}} attempted predation or if the two were simply involved in interspecific aggression. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Dinobothrium septaria and Hepatoxylon trichiuri, and the copepods Dinemoura producta, Laminifera doello-juradoi, and Pandarus floridanus. Natural annual mortality is low, estimated to be 10% for juveniles, 15% for adult males, and 20% for adult females in the western North Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Predators on the {{breeding}} grounds include feral and domestic cats, introduced American mink, feral ferrets, otters and red foxes, and birds including the common buzzard and hooded crow. In Lithuania, the introduced raccoon dog {{has also been}} recorded as taking corn crakes. When chicks are exposed by rapid mowing, they may be taken by large birds including the white stork, harriers and other birds of prey, gulls and corvids. At undisturbed sites nests and broods are rarely attacked, as reflected in a high breeding success. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>record</b> of a corn crake on migration through Gabon being killed by a black sparrowhawk.|$|E

5|$|The Anthony Roll <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>record</b> {{of ships}} of the English Tudor navy of the 1540s, named after its creator, Anthony Anthony. It {{originally}} {{consisted of three}} rolls of vellum, depicting 58naval vessels along with information on their size, crew, armament, and basic equipment. The rolls were presented to KingHenry VIII in 1546, and were kept in the royal library. In 1680 Charles II gave two of the rolls to Samuel Pepys, who had them cut up and bound as a single volume book, which {{is now in the}} Pepys Library at Magdalene College, Cambridge. The third roll remained in the royal collection until it was given by William IV to his daughter, Mary Fox, who sold it to the British Museum in 1858; it is now owned by the British Library.|$|E
5|$|The Christian Songs chart <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>record</b> chart {{compiled}} by Billboard magazine. Launched on June21, 2003, the chart is ranked by overall audience impressions (the approximate number of audience impressions made for each play, {{as determined by}} BDS data cross-referenced with Arbitron listener information). While all Christian radio formats are covered by the Christian Songs chart, it is dominated by Christian adult contemporary (Christian AC) radio stations, which cater to a mostly adult audience. As opposed to Christian stations that cater to young audiences, Christian AC stations tend to play hits often and for long periods. As a result, number-one singles on the Christian Songs chart often have lengthy stays at the top position.|$|E
5|$|The Roksan Xerxes {{transcription}} turntable (often shortened to Xerxes) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>record</b> player {{named after}} the Persian king Xerxes I and produced by London-based Roksan Audio. Designed by Roksan co-founder, Touraj Moghaddam, the Xerxes is a belt-driven turntable that has a solid plinth. Launched in 1985, the sound quality of the product positioned it as a strong competitor against the established industry leader, the Linn Sondek LP12. Many reviewers use the Xerxes as a reference turntable.|$|E

5|$|The UK Singles Chart <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>record</b> chart {{compiled}} {{on behalf}} of the British record industry based on sales of singles in the UK. Since 1997, the chart has been compiled by The Official Charts Company and was based entirely on sales of physical singles from retail outlets until 2005, when digital downloads were included in the chart compilation. The UK Singles Chart originated in 1952, when New Musical Express (NME) published the first chart of singles sales. The positions of all songs are based on week end sale totals, from Sunday to Saturday, but pre-1987, the charts were released on a Tuesday due to the need for manual calculation.|$|E
5|$|The diamond {{stingray}} {{is found}} in the eastern Pacific Ocean from southern California to northern Chile, as well as around the Galápagos and Hawaiian Islands; it is very abundant around Baja California and in the Gulf of California. At the northern and southern extremes of its range, it is generally only present during periods of suitably warm water brought about by El Niño. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>record</b> of this ray from off British Columbia, which is unconfirmed and would be highly anomalous as it is known to be a tropical and warm-temperate species.|$|E
5|$|The {{goldcrest}} takes a {{wide variety}} of prey, especially spiders, caterpillars, bugs, springtails and flies. Larger prey such as oak bush crickets and tortrix moths may sometimes be taken. Flying insects are taken in hovering flight but not normally pursued; there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>record</b> of a goldcrest attacking a large dragonfly in flight, only to be dragged along by the insect before releasing it unharmed. Goldcrests will occasionally feed on the ground among leaf-litter with tits. Non-animal food is rare, although goldcrests have been seen drinking sap from broken birch twigs together with tits and nuthatches.|$|E
