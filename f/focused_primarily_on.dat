5|$|By the 19th century, Victorian {{scholars}} such as William Stubbs, James Ramsay, and William Hunt {{sought to}} understand how the English political system had evolved under Henry. They explored the emergence of Parliamentary institutions during his reign, and sympathized with the concerns of the chroniclers over the role of the Poitevins in England. This focus carried on into early 20th-century research into Henry, such as Kate Norgate's 1913 volume, which continued to make heavy use of the chronicler accounts and <b>focused</b> <b>primarily</b> <b>on</b> constitutional issues, with a distinctive nationalistic bias.|$|E
5|$|During his term, Marshall <b>focused</b> <b>primarily</b> <b>on</b> {{advancing}} the progressive agenda. He successfully advocated {{the passage of}} a child labor law and anti-corruption legislation. He supported popular election of U.S. Senators, and the constitutional amendment to allow it was ratified by the Indiana General Assembly during his term. He also overhauled the state auditing agencies and claimed to have saved the government millions of dollars. He was unsuccessful in passing the rest of the progressive platform agenda items or persuading the legislature to call a convention to rewrite the state constitution to expand the government's regulatory powers.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the Department of Justice {{created the}} Civil Rights Section, which <b>focused</b> <b>primarily</b> <b>on</b> First Amendment and labor rights. The {{increasing}} scrutiny of totalitarianism in the lead-up to World War II brought increased attention {{to issues of}} slavery and involuntary servitude, abroad and at home. The U.S. sought to counter foreign propaganda and increase its credibility on the race issue by combatting the Southern peonage system. Under the leadership of Attorney General Francis Biddle, the Civil Rights Section invoked the constitutional amendments and legislation of the Reconstruction Era {{as the basis for}} its actions.|$|E

5|$|The pre-game buildup <b>focused</b> <b>primarily</b> <b>on</b> the two high-powered offenses, both {{of which}} were led by strong rushing attacks. The rushing attacks differed; Northern Illinois' was led by junior quarterback Jordan Lynch, who {{finished}} fourth in the nation in rushing, while Kent State's was led by a running back tandem consisting of Dri Archer and Trayion Durham. The opening line favored Northern Illinois by seven points. After being tied at the end of regulation, the game went into two overtime periods and eventually concluded with Northern Illinois winning 44â€“37. The Huskies were subsequently invited to the 2013 Orange Bowl.|$|E
5|$|The school {{typically}} puts on {{two shows}} each year: a spring performance featuring less advanced students studying circus arts at beginning and intermediate levels, and a late summer show {{to display the}} talents of more advanced students. While the earliest shows were <b>focused</b> <b>primarily</b> <b>on</b> technique and the individual acts, by 1997 or 1998 the school began to emphasize the artistic side of performances, including integrating those acts into Cirque du Soleil-style narratives. The school also hosts an annual gala in late autumn that includes portions of the year's earlier summer performance. Circus Juventas does not utilize animal acts in its shows.|$|E
5|$|US Marines {{conducted}} an amphibious landing at Cape Torokina, {{on the western}} coast of Bougainville, north of Empress Augusta Bay, in November 1943. After an initial counter-attack that was repulsed, the Marines {{had been replaced by}} a garrison of US Army troops who began consolidating their position around Torokina, establishing a strong perimeter. In March 1944, the Japanese launched a heavy counter-attack, which was turned back with many casualties. After this, the situation on Bougainville became largely static, as the Japanese <b>focused</b> <b>primarily</b> <b>on</b> subsistence, and the US forces chose to adopt a mostly defensive posture aimed at maintaining the perimeter around Torokina.|$|E

5|$|Early 20th-century weight limits were enacted {{to protect}} dirt and gravel roads from {{damage caused by}} the solid wheels of heavy trucks. As time passed, truck weight limits <b>focused</b> <b>primarily</b> <b>on</b> gross weight limits (which had no {{prescribed}} limits on length). By 1974, bridges received special protection from increasing truck weight limits. The bridge formula law was enacted by the U.S. Congress to limit the weight-to-length ratio of heavy trucks, and to protect roads and bridges from {{the damage caused by}} the concentrated weight of shorter trucks. The formula effectively lowers the legal weight limit for shorter trucks, preventing them from causing premature deterioration of bridges and highway infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|Gotcha was {{designed}} by Allan Alcorn, the designer of Pong, and a prototype was constructed by Cyan Engineering, Atari's semi-independent research and development subsidiary.

The cabinet {{was designed}} by George Faraco, initially with the joysticks encased in pink domes meant to represent breasts.

5|$|The pre-game buildup <b>focused</b> <b>primarily</b> <b>on</b> {{the strong}} rushing attacks of both teams {{as well as}} the overall sound offense of Fresno State. Most analysts {{predicted}} a resounding victory by Fresno State. The point spread favored Fresno State as 12-point favorites over the Mustangs. Contrary to predictions, SMU won the game by a score of 43-10, largely thanks to the play of defensive end Margus Hunt, who forced two fumbles and totaled three sacks (including one safety) as well as two interceptions that were returned for touchdowns. Consequently, Hunt and Fresno State's Davante Adams, who totaled 13 receptions for 144 yards and a touchdown, were named the game's co-Most Valuable Player (MVP).|$|E

5|$|Under colonial rule, {{plantations}} {{were established}} {{for the production of}} a variety of export crops. Slavery was abolished in 1896 and approximately 500,000 slaves were freed; many remained in their former masters' homes as servants or as sharecroppers; {{in many parts of the}} island strong discriminatory views against slave descendants are still held today. Wide paved boulevards and gathering places were constructed in the capital city of Antananarivo and the Rova palace compound was turned into a museum. Additional schools were built, particularly in rural and coastal areas where the schools of the Merina had not reached. Education became mandatory between the ages of 6 to 13 and <b>focused</b> <b>primarily</b> <b>on</b> French language and practical skills.|$|E
5|$|Both the Perfect Works and Ultimania {{books have}} <b>focused</b> <b>primarily</b> <b>on</b> Square and Square Enix's {{role-playing}} video game franchises, {{such as the}} Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts series; over 45 of the 75 books are for games related to the Final Fantasy series. Sometimes, multiple books have been written per game or revised editions have been published years afterwards. One of the books, Final Fantasy IX Ultimania Online, was solely published online {{as part of an}} experiment by Square Enix with online content delivery; another for Final Fantasy XI was planned, but the idea was abandoned as unsuccessful and all subsequent books have been published traditionally. The Ultimania series had sold over 10 million books by July 2007. All of the books have been released solely in Japanese, but in October 2017 Dark Horse Books announced that they would be publishing English translations of the three-volume 2012 Final Fantasy 25th Memorial Ultimania as Final Fantasy Ultimania Archive, for release starting in June 2018.|$|E
5|$|First-wave {{feminism}} was {{a period}} of activity during the 19th century and early twentieth century. In the UK and eventually the US, it focused on the promotion of equal contract, marriage, parenting, and property rights for women. By the end of the 19th century, a number of important steps had been made with the passing of legislation such as the UK Custody of Infants Act 1839 which introduced the Tender years doctrine for child custody arrangement and gave woman the right of custody of their children for the first time. Other legislation such as the Married Women's Property Act 1870 in the UK and extended in the 1882 Act, these became models for similar legislation in other British territories. For example, Victoria passed legislation in 1884, New South Wales in 1889, and the remaining Australian colonies passed similar legislation between 1890 and 1897. Therefore, with the turn of the 19th century activism had <b>focused</b> <b>primarily</b> <b>on</b> gaining political power, particularly the right of women's suffrage, though some feminists were active in campaigning for women's sexual, reproductive, and economic rights as well.|$|E
