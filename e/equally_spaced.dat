5|$|In 1907, Einstein {{proposed}} {{a model of}} matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator. In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently—a series of <b>equally</b> <b>spaced</b> quantized states for each oscillator. Einstein was aware that getting {{the frequency of the}} actual oscillations would be difficult, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics. Peter Debye refined this model.|$|E

5|$|Fourier {{series are}} used to solve {{boundary}} value problems in partial differential equations. In 1822, Fourier first used this technique to solve the heat equation. A discrete version of the Fourier series {{can be used in}} sampling applications where the function value is known only at a finite number of <b>equally</b> <b>spaced</b> points. In this case the Fourier series is finite and its value is equal to the sampled values at all points. The set of coefficients is known as the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the given sample sequence. The DFT {{is one of the key}} tools of digital signal processing, a field whose applications include radar, speech encoding, image compression. The JPEG image format is an application of the closely related discrete cosine transform.|$|E

5|$|Steadily {{rising sea}} levels then further {{isolated}} this little island, which is entirely of volcanic origin. It {{consists of a}} basement of tuff, underneath colonnades of a black fine-grained Tertiary basalt, overlying which is a third layer of basaltic lava without a crystalline structure. By contrast, slow cooling of the second layer of basalt resulted in an extraordinary pattern of predominantly hexagonal columns which form the faces and walls of the principal caves. The lava contracted towards each {{of a series of}} <b>equally</b> <b>spaced</b> centres as it cooled and solidified into prismatic columns, a process known as columnar jointing. The columns typically have three to eight sides, six being most common. The columns are also divided horizontally by cross joints. These columnar jointed sections represent the tops and bottoms of individual lava flows. Between these sections lie regions of much more chaotic jointing, known as the entablature. The origin of the entablature is unknown, but could be due to flooding of the lava flow, causing much more rapid cooling, or the interaction of stress fields from the two regions of columnar jointing as they approach one another.|$|E

Initial erect chest radiograph was inconclusive.

40|$|Recently in {{cryptography}} and security, the multipliers with subquadratic {{space complexity}} for trinomials and some specific pentanomials have been proposed. For {{such kind of}} multipliers, alternatively, we use double basis multiplication which combines the polynomial basis and the modified polynomial basis {{to develop a new}} efficient digit-serial systolic multiplier. The proposed multiplier depends on trinomials and almost <b>equally</b> <b>space</b> pentanomials (AESPs), and utilizes the subquadratic Toeplitz matrix-vector product scheme to derive a low-latency digit-serial systolic architecture. If the selected digit-size is d bits, the proposed digit-serial multiplier for both polynomials, i. e., trinomials and AESPs, requires the latency of 2 ⌈√{m/d⌉, while traditional ones take at least O(⌈m/d⌉) clock cycles. Analytical and application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) synthesis results indicate that both the area and the time × area complexities of our proposed architecture are significantly lower than the existing digit-serial systolic multipliers...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} coupled excitonic and vibrational {{effects in}} carbon nanotubes using a time-dependent Hartree−Fock approach. The results reveal intricate details of excited-state dynamics. In the ground state, spontaneous uneven {{distribution of the}} ð electrons over the bonds (i. e., Peierls dimerization) is observed throughout the entire nanotube, particularly in large-radius CNTs. However, we demonstrate that vibrational relaxation following photoexcitations leads to substantial local distortion of the tube surface, overriding the Peierls dimerization. This mutually affects the electronic system, resulting in localized states (self-trapped excitons). These phenomena critically control photoinduced dynamics and charge transport in nanotube materials. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are quasi-one-dimensional structures composed of a one-atom-thick layer of graphite rolled into a tube. 1 Their extended backbones support a delocalized mobile ð-electron system. This results in a semiconductor or metal-like electronic structure with unique physical properties, promising {{for a number of}} technological applications. 2 - 7 Electronic structure of CNTs based on tight-binding models predicts <b>equally</b> <b>space...</b>|$|R

There are 4 chords on the center (<b>equally</b> <b>spaced</b> under equal temperament – spacing of 4/4/4 between tones), corresponding to the augmented triads (thought of as musical sets) C♯FA, DF♯A♯, D♯GB, and EG♯C (then they cycle: FAC♯ = C♯FA), with the 12 major chords and 12 minor chords being the points next to but not on the center – almost evenly spaced but not quite. Major chords correspond to 4/3/5 (or equivalently, 5/4/3) spacing, while minor chords correspond to 3/4/5 spacing. Key changes then correspond to movement between these points in the orbifold, with smoother changes effected by movement between nearby points.|$|E

50|$|The {{screw and nut}} {{may have}} very fine {{identical}} single- or two-start threads. Recirculating rollers are grooved (instead of threaded) so they move axially during spinning engagement with the threads of the nut and screw, shifting up or down by one lead of thread after completing an orbit around the screw. The nut assembly typically includes a slotted cage and cam rings. The cage captivates the rollers in elongated slots, <b>equally</b> <b>spacing</b> the rollers while permitting rotation and axial motion of the rollers. The cam rings have opposing cams aligned with an axial groove in {{the wall of the}} nut. After a roller completes an orbit about the nut it is released into the groove, disengages from nut and screw, and is pushed between the cams to the axial midpoint of the nut assembly (shifting by a distance equal to the lead of the screw). Returned to its starting position, and reengaged to nut and screw, the roller may then orbit the screw once again.|$|R

The cylinders are identical, and their axes <b>equally</b> <b>spaces</b> in a plane perpendicular to the channel walls. The analysis has been made by employing the multipole expansion method under the assumption of linear water wave theory. At least {{the same number of}} trapped modes is shown to exist as the number of cylinders for both Neumann and Dirichlet trapped modes, with the exception that for cylinders having large radius the mode corresponding to the Dirichlet trapped mode for one cylinder will disappear. Close similarities between the Dirichlet trapped modes around {{a row of}} cylinders in a channel and the near-resonant phenomenon in the wave diffraction around a long array of cylinders in the open sea are discussed.
