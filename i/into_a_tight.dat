As Thompson's platoon approached the town, it was ambushed by a large force of North Korean People's Army troops. Automatic weapons fire caused several men in the company to panic and flee.

5|$|Galactica departs {{the station}} and rises a chain lift hill. The ride's first drop dips to the right, before rising back up and flying through the ride's centrepiece theming element, a portal, which links to the ride's space theme. Followed by this, riders are turned from the prone {{position}} onto their backs. The coaster then performs a large upward left turn before twisting again, returning riders to the prone position. After exiting from the lie-to-fly element, Galactica passes underneath a small ravine before pitching up, <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> turn over the plaza area. A 360 degrees inline twist is followed up {{by a series of}} straight flying, and several turns and dips in the track. The train then comes to a stop on the brake run before returning to one of the station's two stations.|$|E

They record not only payments made to the government, but debts owed to the crown and disbursements made by royal officials. Although they recorded much of the royal income, they did not record all types of income, nor did they record all expenditures, so they are not strictly speaking a budget.

5|$|After he {{graduated}} from Warren High School in Arkansas, where he played football as a wide receiver, Gragg committed to the University of Arkansas along with three other Warren players. Although he spent his freshman season as a receiver on the Arkansas Razorbacks football squad, the coaching staff converted Gragg <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> end in 2010. In his sophomore and junior seasons, the Razorbacks made appearances in Bowl Championship Series games and defeated the Kansas State Wildcats in the 2012 Cotton Bowl Classic, which culminated the 2011 season. A knee injury caused Gragg to miss eight games in his senior season as the Arkansas team finished with a losing record. Invited {{to participate in the}} NFL Scouting Combine, an evaluative competition among prospective NFL players, Gragg ran the fastest 40-yard dash time and had the second-highest vertical jump among tight ends in attendance; in the draft, the Bills chose Gragg with the 222nd overall selection, a pick Buffalo acquired from a trade with the St. Louis Rams. One of five tight ends in spring training, he made Buffalo's regular-season roster and played in nine regular-season games during the 2013 NFL season. He then played in 10 games in 2014 and 13 games in 2015 before missing the entire 2016 season due to injury.|$|E

The islanders, believing {{that the world is}} about to end, clamber up a hillside to watch the final death throes of the creature at a safe distance from the resulting tidal waves and earthquakes. As it dies, the creature's teeth fall out to become the islands of Orkney, Shetland and the Faroes.

5|$|Attempting {{his usual}} tactic, the British crew {{approached}} {{from behind and}} below. Suddenly the Heinkel lurched <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> left-hand turn allowing the gunners to fire a broad-side. The bomber disappeared into the mist. Cunningham asked GCI for help. They tracked the Heinkel flying north near Shaftesbury. Engaging again the German pilot managed {{to turn into a}} head-on position and dive past almost upside down. He continually evaded Cunningham by turning in underneath him at near-impossible angles. Cunningham and Rawnsley came to understand they were not dealing with a novice. Soon a turning match began and then the German attempted to escape by twisting and diving. Cunningham forced him down to 900 feet but Rawnsley and GCI lost contact when the ground clutter hid the Heinkel's signal. Cunningham returned to base. News soon came through the He 111 had crashed onto the slopes on Cranborne Chase. Apparently, the Heinkel had broken through the clouds at only a hundred feet and dived vertically into the ground near the isolated village of Alvediston at 17:05. Intelligence later determined that the machine was a He 111H-6, Werknummer 4627, code 6N+FR, from 7./KGr 100. The bomber disintegrated upon impact. The pilot, Staffelkapitän ("squadron leader") Hauptmann Siegried Langer was killed along with his crew; Oberfeldwebel G. Schmidt, Feldwebel D. Hoffmann, P. Gaidies and Gefreiter W. Worring. It was a unique victory for Cunningham. He had not fired his guns in the 150-minute chase.|$|E

The low-gain antenna was used close to Earth. It is omni-directional, so the transmission power that reached Earth fell faster with increasing distance. As the craft moved closer to Mars, the Sun and Earth moved closer in the sky as viewed from the craft, so less energy reached Earth.
