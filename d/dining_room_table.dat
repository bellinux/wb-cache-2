5|$|Although Emerson {{credits his}} grandfather's {{gift of a}} Barlow knife {{to him at the}} age of eight years with {{starting}} his interest in knives, it was not until later in life that he turned to making them. The summer of 1978 found Emerson in need of a balisong knife for his study of a Filipino martial art and, unable to afford one on his salary, Emerson decided he would attempt to make his own instead. He milled and drilled the handles from aluminum stock; the knife's blade was a simple steel blank that he hand cut with a hacksaw, shaped with files, and heat treated at his <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>table</b> with a butane torch.|$|E
5|$|Following the letters, Jackson {{received}} a parcel containing {{a photograph of}} the fan, as well as a letter and a gun. Jackson was horrified; the letter asked that the pop singer kill himself on a certain day and at a specific time. The fan would do the same once she had killed their baby. She wrote that if they could not be together in this life, then they would be in the next. To his mother's dismay, Jackson had the photograph of the woman framed and hung above the <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>table</b> of their family home. Afterwards, the Jacksons discovered that the fan had been sent to a psychiatric hospital.|$|E

5|$|FBI Special Agents Don Eppes (Rob Morrow), Terry Lake (Sabrina Lloyd) and David Sinclair (Alimi Ballard) {{investigate}} a serial rapist who has begun killing his victims. With the twelfth victim, Karen Silber (Kate Norby), changing her story {{again and the}} thirteenth victim's car missing, Don runs out of viable leads. Taking a map and a case file with him, Don goes to his childhood home, owned by his father Alan Eppes (Judd Hirsch), to take a shower. Don's younger brother, Dr. Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz) of CalSci's mathematics department, finds and studies the map which Don lays on the <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>table.</b> As Don prepares {{to return to the}} office, Charlie tries to talk Don into letting him help with the investigation and is inspired by the pattern of drops emanating from the family's sprinkler. He tells Don that he can use a mathematical model to find the neighborhood where the rapist resides. Skeptical, Don agrees to let Charlie assist him in the investigation.|$|E
5|$|The second chorus has {{the girls}} {{dancing on the}} table, {{knocking}} several pieces of food and tuppleware onto the ground. A-Chan is seen lying down on a pillow, whilst Kashiyuka balances a book and an apple on her head. Both of these scenes have them throwing several pieces of food onto the table. Nocchi is seen at the dining table, holding a fork and listen to music through her headphones. She witnesses a small door underneath a stool, opens it, and sees a small green room. In the room, a blurred image of a cup starts to become clear, and holds small candy. As the girls eat the pieces of candy, their cream-coloured dresses turn into the outfits from the cover sleeve from the single. The girls start dancing in the fish bowl, surrounded by glittery lights. The final scene has the girls looking through the small door again, only to witness the <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>table</b> empty; the small cup with candy appears in beige colouring rather than full-on vibrancy.|$|E
5|$|Harland Sanders {{was born}} in 1890 and raised on a farm outside Henryville, Indiana (near Louisville, Kentucky). When Sanders was five years old, his father died, forcing his mother {{to work at a}} canning plant. This left Sanders, as the eldest son, to care for his two younger siblings. After he reached seven years of age, his mother taught him how to cook. After leaving the family home at the age of 13, Sanders passed through several professions, with mixed success. In 1930, he took over a Shell filling station on US Route 25 just outside North Corbin, Kentucky, a small town {{on the edge of the}} Appalachian Mountains. It was here that he first served to {{travelers}} the recipes that he had learned as a child: fried chicken and other dishes such as steaks and country ham. After four years of serving from his own <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>table,</b> Sanders purchased the larger filling station on the other side of the road and expanded to six tables. By 1936, this had proven successful enough for Sanders to be given the honorary title of Kentucky colonel by Governor Ruby Laffoon. In 1937 he expanded his restaurant to 142 seats, and added a motel he purchased across the street, naming it Sanders Court & Café.|$|E

25|$|King Ludwig II of Bavaria in his castles of Linderhof and Herrenchiemsee, built {{during the}} same period as the Palais Strousberg took the invisibility of his {{servants}} one step further by having designed <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>tables</b> which were lowered through the floor to the kitchens below to be replenished between courses, negating the need for a servant's immediate presence completely. However, while the Palais Strousberg's layout of its servants' quarters was common throughout the capital cities of Europe, King Ludwig's seem to have been more an eccentricity peculiar to him.|$|R
25|$|The three {{fireplaces}} on {{the first}} floor use a combination of Georgian, Spanish and Italian marbles as well as Brazilian onyx.

25|$|Over {{the next}} several years, Stanford kept writing, {{publishing}} {{in a wide range}} of literary journals and magazines around the world. In 1969, he met Linda Mencin, the daughter of a retired Naval Commander and World War II ace, through a mutual friend. The two soon moved into a house in Fayetteville's Mt. Sequoyah neighborhood together, Mencin working for the War on Poverty and Stanford writing poetry— often all day long. In Mt. Sequoyah, Stanford worked away on his magnum opus, The Battlefield Where The Moon Says I Love You — which he had likely begun as a teenager — handwriting the poem in pen on his and Mencin's <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>table.</b> The full chronology of the creation of the poem is unclear, but consensus is that Stanford worked on the manuscript sporadically over many years until late 1974 or 1975, by which time the book was finished.|$|E
25|$|The {{general layout}} of the House was largely {{untouched}} from the previous non-celebrity series. The living room and bedroom had no noticeable changes. There were several single beds in the same room, with one double bed, meaning that two housemates (Leo and Donny) had to share. The bathroom is much smaller than previous versions and the toilet and shower were no longer fitted with cameras. The <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>table</b> was moved inside, and the kitchen fully equipped with modern conveniences. Outside the garden was a three-jet hot tub with a farmyard seating area. The bridge to Nowhere was still present, leading to a sitting area with heated seats and the topiary man. A workout area was situated just off the kitchen area. Inside the House {{there was also a}} fax machine built into the wall. On day 24 this was used to post viewers' questions to the housemates. Meanwhile, the Diary Room was identical to the previous summer's Big Brother, with an oversized gold chair and padded walls, the only change being the addition of yellow lights facing the walls.|$|E

50|$|The hull {{was formed}} {{into a deep}} lake boat pattern, {{allowing}} the ship to reach speeds not possible for a riverboat of similar proportions. The ship was designed with an eye for elegance, resulting in a graceful silhouette that lacked the boxy or top-heavy look privy to many other vessels. The layout was similar to other Canadian Pacific vessels, with three main decks (bottom-most for freight, machinery and crew's quarters, upper-most decks reserved for passenger travel and comfort with sitting rooms, galleries, observation decks, a dining hall and saloons). Okanagan boasted five <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>tables,</b> with seating for up to thirty guests at a time, along with thirty-two staterooms and a total passenger capacity of four hundred.|$|R

There are no rape scenes in the shower, no banging of cups on <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>tables.</b> It's a study of a human being who is at the lowest point of our social structure... to care about him... to find ways to create in him hope and expectation.

25|$|Jeffreys {{was born}} into a middle-class family in Oxford, where he spent the first six years of his life until 1956, when the family moved to Luton, Bedfordshire. He {{attributes}} his curiosity and inventiveness to having been gained from his father, as well as his paternal grandfather, who held a number of patents. When he was eight, his father gave him a chemistry set, which he enhanced {{over the next few years}} with extra chemicals, even including a small bottle of sulfuric acid. He says he liked making small explosions, but an accidental splash of the sulfuric acid caused a burn, which left a permanent scar on his chin (now under his beard). His father also bought him a Victorian-era brass microscope, which he used to examine biological specimens. At about 12, he made a small dissecting kit (including a scalpel, crafted from a flattened pin) which he used to dissect a bumblebee, but he got into trouble with his parents when he progressed to dissecting a larger specimen. One Sunday morning he found a dead cat on the road while doing his paper round and took it home in his bag. He relates that he started to dissect it on the <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>table</b> before Sunday lunch, causing a foul smell throughout the house after he ruptured its intestines.|$|E

500|$|The dining room's {{underwent}} {{an extensive}} remodel in 1898 because of Ellwood's rise to national prominence through his barbed wire partnership with Joseph Glidden. The room was enlarged through {{the addition of}} a semi-circular bay. Beyond the addition, the room was refurnished and redecorated to reflect the Georgian Revival alterations that were occurring on the home's exterior. Elements of Georgian Revival architecture that were incorporated into the Ellwood dining room remodel include, mahogany paneling with dentil molding around the windows and doors, a cornice with Classical details, and brackets. Almost all of the dining room's 1898 furniture and woodwork was custom made by Tobey & Company of Chicago and each piece is affixed with a dated brass plate. The main <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>table</b> and chairs were cast in an early Georgian style and the table has twelve extra leaves which can extend it [...] the length of the room. The dining room's smaller table, situated within the bay addition, was used for Ellwood family breakfasts.|$|E
