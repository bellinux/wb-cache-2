Here, we examined the translocation efficiency of mutant GTPases that block the interaction between SRP and SR at specific stages. Surprisingly, mutants that allow SRP–SR complex assembly but block GTPase activation severely compromise protein translocation. These mutations map to the highly conserved insertion box domain loops that rearrange upon complex formation to form multiple catalytic interactions with the two GTPs. Thus, although GTP hydrolysis is not required, the molecular rearrangements that lead to GTPase activation are essential for protein targeting. Most importantly, our results show that an elaborate rearrangement within the SRP–SR GTPase complex is required to drive the unloading and initiate translocation of cargo proteins...|$|R

25|$|The SRP RNA is an {{integral}} part of the small and the large domain of the SRP. The function of the small domain is to delay protein translation until the ribosome-bound SRP has an opportunity to associate with the membrane-resident SRP receptor (SR). Within the large domain, the SRP RNA of the signal peptide-charged SRP promotes the hydrolysis of two <b>guanosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (GTP) molecules. This reaction releases the SRP from the SRP receptor and the ribosome, allowing translation to continue and the protein to enter the translocon. The protein transverses the membrane co-translationally (during translation) and enters into another cellular compartment or the extracellular space. In eukaryotes, the target is the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In Archaea, SRP delivers proteins to the plasma membrane. In the bacteria, SRP primarily incorporates proteins into the inner membrane.|$|E

By immunoprecipitation, Rab 4 A was found to interact with a- and b-catenin {{as well as with}} actin, vimentin, a- and b-tubulin, and protein kinase C (PKC) a and-e. Additionally, administration of Adjudin to adult rats upregulated the Rab 4 A level, which coincided with the loss of spermatocytes, round and elongating/elongated spermatids from the seminiferous epithelium. More importantly, the ability of Rab 4 A to associate with a- and b-catenin increased during Adjudin-induced junction restructuring in the testis, illustrating that Rab 4 A 2 catenin interactions are likely {{to be involved in the}} disassembly of Sertoli– germ cell contacts.

25|$|A {{catabolic pathway}} {{is a series}} of {{reactions}} that bring about a net release of energy {{in the form of a}} high energy phosphate bond formed with the energy carriers Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) and Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP) to produce Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) and <b>Guanosine</b> <b>Triphosphate</b> (GTP), respectively. The net reaction is, therefore, thermodynamically favorable, for it results in a lower free energy for the final products. A catabolic pathway is an exergonic system that produces chemical energy in the form of ATP, GTP, NADH, NADPH, FADH2, etc. from energy containing sources such as carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. The end products are often carbon dioxide, water, and ammonia. Coupled with an endergonic reaction of anabolism, the cell can synthesize new macromolecules using the original precursors of the anabolic pathway. An example of a coupled reaction is the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to form the intermediate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate by the enzyme phsophofructokinase accompanied by the hydrolysis of ATP in the pathway of glycolysis. The resulting chemical reaction within the metabolic pathway is highly thermodynamically favorable and, as a result, irreversible in the cell.|$|E
25|$|H2S therapy uses a H2S donor, such as diallyl trisulfide (DATS), to {{increase}} the supply of H2S to an AMI patient. H2S donors reduce myocardial injury and reperfusion complications. Increased H2S levels within the body will react with oxygen to produce sulfane sulfur, a storage intermediate for H2S. H2S pools in the body attracts oxygen to react with excess H2S and eNOS {{to increase}} NO production. With increased use of oxygen to produce more NO, less oxygen is available to react with eNOS to produce superoxides during an AMI, ultimately lowering the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, decreased accumulation of ROS lowers oxidative stress in vascular smooth muscle cells, decreasing oxidative degeneration of BH4. Increased BH4 cofactor contributes to increased production of NO within the body. Higher concentrations of H2S directly increase eNOS activity through Akt activation to increase phosphorylation of the eNOSS1177 activation site, and decrease phosphorylation of the eNOST495 inhibition site. This phosphorylation process upregulates eNOS activity, catalyzing more conversion of L-arginine to NO. Increased NO production enables soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) activity, leading to an increased conversion of <b>guanosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (GTP) to 3’,5’-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). In H2S therapy immediately following an AMI, increased cGMP triggers an increase in protein kinase G (PKG) activity. PKG reduces intracellular Ca2+ in vascular smooth muscle to increase smooth muscle relaxation and promote blood flow. PKG also limits smooth muscle cell proliferation, reducing intima thickening following AMI injury, ultimately decreasing myocardial infarct size.|$|E

High Dock 180 cytoplasmic expression in ovarian cancer (n= 108) was associated significantly with serous histological type, high-grade cancer and advanced stage (P< 0. 05), as well as poor overall and disease-free survival (P= 0. 004). Using multivariate progression analysis, high Dock 180 cytoplasmic expression and advanced cancer stage were found to be independent prognostic factors for short overall survival and disease-free survival (P< 0. 05). Exogenous expression of Dock 180 by transient transfection enhanced cancer cell migration and invasion, whereas knockdown of Dock 180 by an siRNA approach retarded cancer cell migration and invasion in association with down-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase 2.

In this study, we are trying to understand if loss of RAB 25 expression in Human Mammary Epithelial Cell (HMEC) lines co-operates with H-Ras mutations and contributes to tumorigenesis. HMEC were immortalized by transduction with LXSN CDK 4 R 24 C, a mutant form of cyclin-dependent kinase, followed by transduction with hTERT, catalytic subunit of the telomerase enzyme that permits the cells to exceed the Hayflick Limit and become immortal.

During macropexophagy, the expression of sar 1 pT 34 N inhibited the formation of the pexophagosome, whereas sar 1 pH 79 G suppressed the delivery of the peroxisome from the pexophagosome to the vacuole. The pexophagosome contained Atg 8 p in wild-type cells, but in cells expressing sar 1 pH 79 G these organelles contain both Atg 8 p and endoplasmic reticulum components as visualized by DsRFP-HDEL. Our results demonstrate key roles for Sar 1 p in both micro- and macropexophagy...|$|R
40|$|The dioxin {{receptor}} (AhR) modulates cell plasticity and migration, {{although the}} signaling involved remains unknown. Here, we report a mechanism that integrates AhR into these cytoskeleton-related functions. Immortalized and mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking AhR (AhR−/−) had increased cell area due to spread cytoplasms that reverted to wild-type morphology upon AhR re-expression. The AhR-null phenotype included increased F-actin stress fibers, depolarized focal adhesions, and enhanced spreading and adhesion. The cytoskeleton alterations of AhR−/− cells {{were due to}} down-regulation of constitutive Vav 3 expression, a <b>guanosine</b> diphosphate/guanosine <b>triphosphate</b> exchange factor for Rho/Rac GTPases and a novel transcriptional target of AhR. AhR was recruited to the vav 3 promoter and maintained constitutive mRNA expression in a ligand-independent manner. Consistently, AhR−/− fibroblasts had reduced Rac 1 activity and increased activation of the RhoA/Rho kinase (Rock) pathway. Pharmacological inhibition of Rac 1 shifted AhR+/+ fibroblasts to the null phenotype, whereas Rock inhibition changed AhR-null cells to the AhR+/+ morphology. Knockdown of vav 3 transcripts by small interfering RNA induced cytoskeleton defects and changes in adhesion and spreading mimicking those of AhR-null cells. Moreover, vav 3 −/− MEFs, as AhR−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts, had increased cell area and enhanced stress fibers. By modulating Vav 3 -dependent signaling, AhR could regulate cell shape, adhesion, and migration under physiological conditions and, perhaps, in certain pathological states...|$|R
40|$|Particulate {{fractions}} {{from the}} taxonomically diverse fungi Achlya ambisexualis, Hansenula anomala, Neurospora crassa, Cryptococcus laurentii, Schizophyllum commune, and Wangiella dermatitidis {{were found to}} catalyze the time-dependent incorporation of glucose from UDP-[14 C]glucose into a water-insoluble material. The reaction was stimulated by bovine serum albumin. The product was characterized as beta(1 [...] 3) glucan {{on the basis of}} its resistance to alpha- and beta-amylase and susceptibility to beta(1 [...] 3) glucanase. With the exception of the preparation from A. ambisexualis, all others were stimulated by nucleoside triphosphates and their analogs. The best activators were GTP and <b>guanosine</b> 5 '-(gamma-thio) <b>triphosphate.</b> It is concluded that the stimulation by nucleotides, previously found with the glucan synthetase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is a regulatory mechanism that was well conserved during fungal evolution, presumably because of its importance in controlling cell wall biosynthesis and cell growth...|$|R
