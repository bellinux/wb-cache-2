40|$|The {{position}} of enterprises in their markets {{is based on}} economical aspects and applied consumer proximity. In order to ensure this, {{it is necessary to}} use available resources in a very effective way. So planning and dispositive aspects in scheduling manufacturing systems are more and more important Operation research strategies and methodologies can help to handle this job. This paper discusses the question, why such strategies are not used in a higher frequency in planning manufacturing systems as at the moment. Four possible reasons are examined in this article. The purpose is to develop some requirements for an increasing acceptance of computer based scheduling systems using operation research strategies. The utilization of an computer based scheduling system permits <b>disponents</b> to plan performance of manufacturing systems as well as to evaluate the consequences of some special manufacturing alternatives in an easy way. The emerging information's are groundwork for ensuring the esti mation of manufacturing methods. Some strategies are implemented in the computer based scheduling system OSC++. A special topic of OSC++ is the randomly interactive positioning of manufacturing operations in a schedule. Now it is possible to contribute production inherent knowledge, combined with experiences of <b>disponents</b> into the planning of manufacturing scheduling in a direct wa...|$|R

40|$|The {{first part}} of the article is devoted to the history of {{establishing}} and successive transformations of the so-called Fund for Restructuring and Clearing of Debts in the Agriculture of Poland, as well as to its successive <b>disponents.</b> The main issue touched upon by the Author is the question: who is the creditor for an agricultural credited by a local bank with financial means of the Fund, and also - whether the bank (in case of non-performance of this duty by the agriculturer) is authorized to draw his own executory document with a writ of execution (against the agriculturer-debtor) on the basis of art. 53 p. 2 of the banking law. The Author presents his considerations upon the above question on a concrete example. He states in conclusion that art. 53 of the banking law should be derogated because it breaks cardinal principle of civil law, according to which the parts of legal civil relationship are equal and all controversies between them are settled by a court. The disposition a the mentioned could be useful in centrally planned economy, steered rigidly by banks, nevertheless it should not be further maintained in market economy.

40|$|Attitudes of {{respondents}} towards mass sociological research are treated here {{as an element}} of a "model" respondent. This model {{is made up of}} information competence, task comprehension and the motivation for supplying careful, frank and true answers. Attitudes towards the research are thus connected in particular with the last element of the above definition. In our view, the more positive is the respondent’s approach to the research, the better he will meet the conditions put to him by the researcher. The title of this paper is an epitome, since the concept of "attitudes towards mass sociological research" covers also the fact that respondents entertain definite convictions about sociology as a science, about its capacities and methods of application of its results, the relation between the <b>disponents</b> of power and the sociologists, etc. The attitudes of Polish respondents towards the mas sociological research are conditioned by a complex of frequently contradictory factors which are described in detail in this paper. We have put forward a thesis that even though he agrees to the interview, the Polish respondent seldom meets the requirements for the so-called model informant or respondent.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new heuristic for vehicle routing problems with narrow time windows. The problem arises {{in the context}} of the delivery of groceries to restaurants. For most of the instances the given time window distribution does not allow solutions where no time restrictions are violated. The aim is to schedule most of the customers in time building regionally bounded tours. The few remaining customers have to be scheduled manually. If the <b>disponent</b> decides to serve one or more of the remaining customers in time, he has to allow out-of-time deliveries for some of the automatically planned stops. The algorithm is based on a clustering procedure where a tree with multiple node weights is divided into subtrees. Upper bounds restrict the sums of the weight functions in each subtree. This problem is NP-complete even for trees with bounded degree and more than two weight functions. A greedy algorithm is developed to determine the tree partition. For our application it is extended to a version which also checks if each subtree can be routed regarding the problem specific requirements. Although the algorithm was developed for a specific real world problem, the ideas can also be applied to other vehicle routing problems - even to those with more complicated constraints...|$|E
40|$|The Commercial Court’s recent {{decision}} in Progress Bulk Carriers Ltd v Tube City IMS LLC (The Cenk Kaptanoglu) {{is an interesting}} example of economic duress founded (in part) on a lawful threat. The claimants in this case were the <b>disponent</b> owners of the vessel Cenk Kaptanoglu. On 2 April 2009, they chartered the vessel to the respondent-charterers for the carriage of shredded scrap but delivered the vessel to a third party shortly thereafter. This constituted a repudiatory breach of the charterparty, which was not accepted by the charterers {{even though there was}} then no realistic chance of the Cenk Kaptanoglu’s fulfilling the charter. Conceding their error, the owners promised to provide an alternative vessel and compensate the charterers for their loss. A substitute vessel (the Agia) was subsequently identified, but by that time it was clear that a delay in shipment could not be avoided. The charterers then sought, unsuccessfully, to negotiate a discount on the freight as a condition for accepting the Agia and the late shipment. On 28 April 2009, the owners made a “take it or leave it” offer, requiring the charterers to accept the Agia at a $ 2 per metric ton discount and waive all claims connected to the owners’ repudiatory breach. The charterers eventually agreed under protest...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a review of}} syntactic-semantic structures with the so-called subject genitive, it describes and in a specific way compares all syntactic-semantic models {{with this type of}} genitive and discusses the necessary syntactic-semantic conditions which influence its appearance with the comment on the necessary pragmatic conditions where it is relevant. In comparison with the interpretations existing so far, this category is somewhat extended, and the appearance of genitive in specific models mentioned by other authors, too - is explicitly classified into this category, which has not been the case before. Subject genitive, as an exponent of the grammatical subject in the deep predication (full verbal lexeme [condensed by the deverbal noun] or copulative with the adjective as a semantic core [condensed by the deadjectival noun], or the predication of the reduced relative clause in the function of the restrictive identifier of the basic noun of the type nomina loci and nomina collectiva) or as a denotator of the semantic subject, in both cases with the meaning of agent - the direct performer of the activity or an intermediary, but also a pseudo-agent, e. g. the indicator of a characteristic, of existence, objects instrument, of the entity created in the process of the verb activity possessor, causer, indicator of a state or feeling, <b>disponent</b> (temporary possessor) - is realized equally in nominal and verbal structures, and in a particular instance also in the occasional variant of the sentence with one type of modal particles (evo, eto, eno, gle) in a specific pragmatic situation. In the Standard Serbian Language the subject genitive is the element of the secondary syntactic-semantic structures - generated from the basic deep, prototypical, structures (all models except the model with the personal and the model with the medial predication), or the element of the basic syntactic-semantic structures but so-called converse structures (the model with the personal and the model with the medial predication).

The article {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the development of Croatian maritime law in the areas related to liability for death and personal injury of crew, such as: (i) entities liable on the ship’s side (Who is liable?); (ii) jurisdiction (Where to sue?); (iii) basis of liability (On what ground may a crewmember claim?); (iv) direct action (May a crewmember sue the liability insurer?); and (v) mediation and arbitration (How to efficiently resolve disputes?). The Croatian Maritime Code (CMC) provides that operator (<b>disponent</b> owner), ship’s manager, company under ISM Code and employer are jointly and severally liable for the crew claims. The article suggests that the ship owner should be added to the list. CMC provides that Croatian courts shall have jurisdiction for crewmember claims if the claimant has domicile in Croatia. The article argues that general principles contained in Council Regulation (EC) No 44 / 2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters should be applied combined with a forum non conveniens provision for cases where non EU countries are involved. CMC provides that the ship operator (and others) are liable for crew claims if they are at fault, or if the death or injury is caused by a hazardous thing or activity, or by a lack of safety measures at work, when they are strictly liable under provisions of the general law on liability for hazardous things or activities. The article suggests that the ship operator (and others) are liable for the fault of their employees as well, and that strict liability is imposed independently of the general law with defence of contributory negligence of the claimant...|$|E
