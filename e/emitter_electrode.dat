40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development of metallisation and interconnection schemes for e-beam evaporated polycrystalline silicon thin-film solar cells on glass substrates. Of particular interest is a method for series connection of individual cells to primarily minimise light leakage to the glass substrate and thus to reduce associated current loss. In this thesis, two new metallisation schemes have been developed and investigated. The first scheme is called the &# 147;aligned bifacial interconnected metallisation&# 148;. The diode is divided into individual cells by laser scribing an isolation groove, which is then filled with photoresist to act as an isolating dielectric. Aluminium is deposited over the whole device and patterned to form interconnected bifacial mini-modules. The open-circuit voltage of the mini-module was the sum of individual cells' voltages, indicating a successful interconnection. The mini-module short-circuit was slightly higher than the individual cell current due to lower light leakage in the glass substrate when a diffuse back surface reflector is used for light trapping. Current gain of about 2. 6 % of a mini-module was achieved through the interconnection of individual cells. The second scheme investigated is the "self-aligned bifacial interconnected metallisation". In this scheme the emitter grooves are etched down to the glass substrates rather than to the emitter layer as in aligned bifacial scheme. <b>Emitter</b> <b>electrodes</b> are formed by filling the grooves with evaporated aluminium, which does not need alignment. The resulting <b>emitter</b> <b>electrodes</b> were wider, which was expected to reduce series resistance. However, the series resistance of both the individual cells and interconnected mini-modules were found to be higher due to reduced area of contact between the <b>emitter</b> <b>electrodes</b> and the <b>emitter</b> sidewalls. Devices metallised using this self-aligned scheme also recorded low shunt resistances due to Schottky contacts between <b>emitter</b> <b>electrodes</b> and the cell absorber. E-beam evaporated thin-film cells were successfully interconnected using the aligned bifacial scheme. Additional short-circuit current of the mini-module was reported, due to less current loss from light leakage through the glass substrate.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation on}} {{the enhancement of}} convective heat transfer of a flat plate and LED using ionic wind is reported. The natural and forced convection heat transfers were considered. The ionic wind describes the generation of airflow between two electrodes held at a potential difference and is known to enhance heat transfer. An in-depth review of literatures is provided, where the enhancement of heat transfer is attributed to the generation of secondary flow and disruption of existing boundary layer. Two experimental setups have been constructed, for the natural convection heat transfer enhancement of a flat plate and for the forced convection heat transfer enhancement of LED. The bulk flow forced convection of the LED was generated by an axial fan. For the investigation with the flat plate, the parameters involved were the applied voltage to generate the ionic wind, the flat plate heat flux, the separation gap of electrodes {{and the number of}} <b>emitter</b> <b>electrodes</b> used. As the applied voltage increased, the enhancement increased. While as the flat plate heat flux increased, the enhancement of ionic wind decreased due to overwhelming effects of buoyancy. With separation gaps of g = 1. 5 cm and g = 1. 75 cm, the ionic wind produced similar enhancements, while the heat transfer enhancement was lower with a separation gap of g = 2 cm. Increasing the number of <b>emitter</b> <b>electrodes</b> did not increase the enhancement as the enhancement was linked to the corona current. The maximum heat transfer enhancement recorded was η = 1. 41. For the enhancement of heat transfer of the LED, the parameters investigated were the bulk flow velocity represented by the Reynolds number and the orientation of electrodes relative to the LED. In the laminar flow regime investigated, the effect of the Reynolds number on the heat transfer enhancement was minimum. At a given low power consumption, the ionic wind enhanced setup produced a lower average heat transfer coefficient as compared to those produced by the setup cooled solely by the axial fan. This was due to the significant heat transfer produced by the axial fan at low power. However, as the total consumption of power increased, the heat transfer enhancement of the ionic wind increased {{beyond the reach of the}} setup with axial fan. The maximum heat transfer enhancement of the LED was η = 1. 38. An analysis of the electrodes geometry was performed and showed that the enhancement of heat transfer was dependent on the orientation of the electrodes relative to the LED.

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Sulfur {{content in}} fuel is an {{increasingly}} important environmental concern. A commonly used method {{for the removal of}} sulfur bearing species from fuel is through hydrodesulphurization. However, due to the implementation of Ultra-Low Diesel Sulfur (ULDS), deeper desulphurization techniques must be explored. In this study, a single phase oxidative desulphurization microreactor is crafted for this purpose. The proposed microreactor is built around the concept of corona discharge. The corona is created through a significant potential difference between a carbon nanotube supported <b>emitter</b> <b>electrode</b> and a stainless steel collector electrode. The current that passes through the two electrodes acts as a catalytic agent for the oxidation of the sulfur bearing species. Dibenzothiophene and tert-butyl peroxide are mixed with decane into two separate feed streams. The two feed streams are sent through a micromixer and continue into the reactor. The reactor system is activated and current flows within the reaction volume between the two electrodes. The proposed reaction mechanism {{is similar to that of}} the photooxidation of dibenzothiophene in which the peroxide is cleaved by the electrical energy and subsequently reacts with the sulfur to form its oxides, sulfoxides and sulfones, respectively. Due to the high polarity of these products, they are easily extracted from the fuel stream.

These nanostructured carbon materials have found their applications for field <b>emitter,</b> fuel cell <b>electrode,</b> electronic device, sensor, electromagnetic absorber, etc. Especially, The CNF can be expected {{to play an important role}} in catalyst supports for fuel cell electrode and chemical reaction [1]. Developing various nanostructured carbon materials at low cost can further expand these applications. Thus far, extensive researches have been made on the CNT synthesis techniques, such as arc-discharge, laser ablation, thermal chemical vapor deposition, pyrolysis using ferrocene, and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In this research, we will introduce the unique synthesis method of CNF from liquid phase carbon source by a solvothermal treatment. The Co metal (ex. Co, Ni, Fe) nanoparticles as the seeds of CNF were prepared from cobalt () acetate tetrahydrate and Na metal. Some reaction aids were also added for formation and dispersion of the Co nanoparticles.

40|$|A {{thorough}} {{experimental and}} theoretical {{characterization of the}} effect of electrostatics on the electrospray process, focusing particularly on the flow rate sensitivity to the applied potential difference (voltage), has been completed. The flow rate and current increase linearly with the applied voltage within cone-jet mode. The effect of geometry on the flow rate to voltage relationship is sensitive to two parameters – the hydraulic resistance and the variation of the electric pressure sensitivity to external geometry. A theoretical and FEM model based on the calculation of the electric field provides an explanation of the geometry variation. This allows for an estimation of the change of flow rate with voltage, under any geometrical circumstance. For the first time the effect of voltage on flow rate across enhanced dripping, pulsed and multi-jet electrospray regimes are outlined. With the exception of enhanced dripping, a linear increase is noticed within most regimes, and is geometrically sensitive. Also at the onset of cone-jet mode a drop in flow rate occurred. The variation of flow rate with voltage can be applied to colloid thrusters to vary the performance. Using the theory outlined in this thesis, an estimate of the flow rate change for a colloid thruster is described, along with its associated performance variation. The effect of voltage on current in cone-jet mode electrospray is detailed, with a similar geometric dependence as the flow rate to voltage relationship established. It is also sensitive to various other parameters, including nominal flow rate. The stability island of cone-jet mode electrospray is explored, and its relationship to the variation of electric field with voltage is outlined. The effect of <b>emitter</b> and <b>electrode</b> geometry on cone-jet onset voltage and cone-jet voltage range is outlined. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
