50|$|Faint little ball (flb) is a gene first {{studied in}} Drosophila.

The gene is located at 3-26 of the Drosophila melanogaster genome. It is named faint little ball because when the gene is mutated the embryo forms a ball of dorsal <b>hypoderm.</b> flb is necessary for several processes to occur during embryonic development, specifically in central nervous system development. It is expressed as quickly as 4 hours after fertilization of the egg. The peak of expression of the flb gene is between 4-8 hours into development. In all processes that are facilitated by flb the same signal transduction pathway is used. Drosophila EGF receptor is involved in the development of embryos as well as larvae/pupae's wings, eyes, legs and ovaries.|$|E
50|$|Ophryocystis elektroscirrha {{is usually}} {{transmitted}} from females to their offspring when the females scatter spores on their egg chorions and surfaces of milkweed leaves, the host plant of monarchs and queens, during oviposition (egg laying).

After they enter a host's gut, the spores open and emerging sporozoites penetrate a larva's gut wall and migrate to its <b>hypoderm</b> (the layer of cells that secrete the larva's cuticle), where they undergo two phases of vegetative reproduction. After the caterpillar pupates, O. elektroscirrha starts reproducing sexually. Three days before adults emerge, developing parasite spores {{can be seen}} through their pupal integuments. The adult butterflies emerge covered with spores, mostly on their abdomens. Parasites do not continue to replicate on adult butterflies and spores must be eaten by larvae before they can cause new infections.|$|E

50|$|When the flb gene is mutated, several {{phenotypic}} abnormalities during {{development can}} be viewed.

This will not occur if the flb is mutated. There are other hypomorphic alleles that also contribute to the retraction of the germ-band, which allow for a spectrum of severity in the phenotype of embryos but they will not recover the Wild Type phenotype completely. This gene is necessary for the development of embryos and if it is not expressed in the appropriate way, it is lethal to the embryo.|$|E

40|$|The Drosophila dopa decarboxylase gene, Ddc, is {{expressed}} in the <b>hypoderm</b> and in specific sets of cells in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). The unique Ddc primary transcript is alternatively spliced in these two tissues. The Ddc CNS mRNA contains all four exons (A through D), whereas the hypodermal mRNA contains only three exons (A, C, and D). To localize cis-regulatory sequences responsible for Ddc alternative splicing, a Ddc minigene and several fusion genes containing various amounts of Ddc sequences fused to fushi tarazu (ftz) exon 1 were constructed and introduced into flies by P-element-mediated germ line transformation. We find that Ddc intron ab and exon B are sufficient to regulate Ddc alternative splicing, since transcripts of a minimal fusion gene containing most of Ddc intron ab and exon B are spliced to exon B in the CNS but not in the <b>hypoderm.</b> These results indicate that Ddc alternative splicing is regulated by either a negative mechanism preventing splicing to exon B in the <b>hypoderm</b> or a positive mechanism activating splicing to exon B in the CNS.
