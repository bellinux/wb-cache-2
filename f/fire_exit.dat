5|$|On 13 April 2008, Speight's {{body was}} {{discovered}} hanging {{from the roof of}} MacMillan House, adjacent to London's Paddington Station, hidden from public view, six days after he died. The discovery was made by railway workers at 10:00am, and British Transport Police confirmed that the body was Speight's on 14 April 2008. An inquest into his death opened on 16 April 2008, and a post-mortem confirmed the cause of death as hanging. It was then adjourned until 20 May. The police said Speight may have used a sixth floor <b>fire</b> <b>exit</b> to get to the area where he was found.|$|E
5|$|Omaha, {{the most}} heavily defended sector, was {{assigned}} to the U.S. 1st Infantry Division, supplemented by troops from the U.S. 29th Infantry Division. They faced the 352nd Infantry Division, rather than the expected single regiment. Strong currents forced many landing craft east of their intended position or delayed them. Casualties were heavier than all the other landings combined, as the men were subjected to fire from the cliffs above. Problems clearing the beach of obstructions led to the beachmaster calling a halt to further landings of vehicles at 08:30. A group of destroyers arrived around this time to offer supporting artillery <b>fire.</b> <b>Exit</b> from Omaha was possible only via five gullies, and by late morning barely six hundred men had reached the higher ground. By noon, as the artillery fire took its toll and the Germans started to run out of ammunition, the Americans were able to clear some lanes on the beaches. They also started clearing the draws of enemy defences so that vehicles could move off the beach. The tenuous beachhead was expanded over the following days, and the D-Day objectives were accomplished by D+3.|$|E
25|$|Cornbrook tram {{stop was}} opened in 1999 on the Altrincham line {{to provide an}} {{interchange}} with the new line to Eccles. There was initially no public access from the street, but this changed on 3 September 2005 when the original <b>fire</b> <b>exit</b> was opened as a public access route.|$|E

25|$|At {{the top of}} the {{building}} is the plant level, which is hidden from view by a colour-coated metal screen. Around the edge of {{the building}} is a metal balustrade to hide the view of the window cleaning device. Alongside the plant level is a gantry. There are eleven lifts in the building, spread amongst two cores, with an additional core containing stairs leading to a ground floor <b>fire</b> <b>exit.</b> There are two platform lifts on the ground floor for disabled access.|$|E
25|$|Duncan, {{aided by}} Senator Parker and Mayor Ramsey, directs the {{elevator}} evacuation from the Promenade Room until the fire renders the express elevators unsafe. Not heeding Duncan's directions, a group is killed when their elevator {{stops on the}} fire's floor. Bigelow is {{having an affair with}} his secretary Lorrie, and both get killed when the fire traps them on the 65th floor. Parker recommends using the stairs to escape, but the <b>fire</b> <b>exit</b> from the Promenade Room is blocked by a wheelbarrow full of hardened cement.|$|E
25|$|Due to its {{enclosed}} sub-surface platforms, New Street {{was designated}} as an underground station {{by the fire}} service. In the 1990s a number of changes {{had to be made}} to the station in order to comply with stricter fire regulations, introduced for underground stations {{as a result of the}} 1987 King's Cross fire. In 1993, a new enclosed footbridge was opened at the Wolverhampton end of the station, with access to the platforms separate from the main building: this was built primarily as a <b>fire</b> <b>exit,</b> but the new exit from the station into Navigation Street was opened to the public. All wooden fittings were removed from the platforms, and new fire doors were also installed at the foot of the stairs and elevators on the platforms.|$|E

25|$|Before the blaze, Happy Land {{was ordered}} closed for {{building}} code violations during November 1988. Violations included lack of <b>fire</b> <b>exits,</b> alarms or sprinkler system. No follow-up {{by the fire}} department was documented.|$|R
50|$|The Hermit {{lived for}} 17 {{years in a}} cave beside the {{southern}} coast, in Island Bay, New Zealand, close to Houghton Bay. The cave had a single opening, through which smoke from his <b>fire</b> <b>exited.</b>|$|R
25|$|Around 9:10p.m., power {{failed in}} the building, {{extinguishing}} the lights. Panic ensued, and even {{those who had been}} calmly moving toward exits in the Cabaret Room began to push and shove each other. The situation was made worse by the fact that of the three exits in the room, two were quickly blocked off by the fire, leaving the crowd to funnel through a single exit. Employees outside the exits attempted to pull guests to safety, but the crush of bodies as those behind pushed upon those in front became so solid that no amount of strength could free most of them. Many of those who escaped the crush blocking the northeast <b>fire</b> <b>exit</b> became lost trying to find other exits. Twists and turns in building design which led to a set of doors opening into a bar area funneled some into a dead end.|$|E
2500|$|Sliding {{glass doors}} {{are common in}} many houses, {{particularly}} as an entrance to the backyard. Such doors are also popular for use for the entrances to commercial structures, although they are not counted as <b>fire</b> <b>exit</b> doors. The door that moves is called the [...] "active leaf", while the door that remains fixed is called the [...] "inactive leaf".|$|E

50|$|All the {{stations}} {{are equipped with}} closed-circuit video system for continuous monitoring of the platforms. High-level fire safety systems, which include automatic fire extinguishers and <b>fire</b> <b>exits,</b> are installed in the metro line, where non-flammable and fireproofing materials were used.|$|R
5000|$|Four {{of the six}} doors, some {{of which}} were <b>fire</b> <b>exits,</b> were chained shut so that [...] "people would not enter without paying", {{according}} to Mayor Aníbal Ibarra. Most of the victims died from inhaling poisonous gases, and carbon monoxide.|$|R
25|$|Aside from {{potentially}} unsafe products, Poundland {{has also}} been found guilty of blocking <b>fire</b> <b>exits</b> and fined £3,000 in 2005, with a further breach in 2011 that incurred a fine of £20,000 and evacuation of a store due to poor fire safety.|$|R

50|$|A Primary 7 pupil who {{was walking}} along {{the west side of}} the gym {{building}} at the time heard loud bangs and screams and looked inside the gym. Hamilton shot in his direction and the pupil was injured by flying glass before running away. From this position, Hamilton fired 24 shots in various directions. He fired shots towards a window next to the <b>fire</b> <b>exit</b> at the south-east end of the gym, possibly at an adult who was walking across the playground, and then fired four more shots in the same direction after opening the <b>fire</b> <b>exit</b> door. Hamilton then exited the gym briefly through the <b>fire</b> <b>exit,</b> firing another four shots towards the cloakroom of the library, striking and injuring Grace Tweddle, another member of staff at the school.|$|E
50|$|The {{exterior}} {{form was}} largely {{that of the}} former Astor Theatre and comprised rendered masonry walls with a large gabled roof sheeted in corrugated iron. Entry to the cinema was from Brunswick Street, with <b>fire</b> <b>exits</b> to the lane and Barker Street.|$|R
50|$|In August 2013, {{representatives of}} Matteson {{attempted}} {{to sue the}} mall owners and order that it be closed, due to fire, safety, and building code violations, including exposed electrical wiring, an inoperative fire sprinkler system, blocked <b>fire</b> <b>exits,</b> a crumbling roof, and a damaged foundation.|$|R
50|$|Note {{that single}} {{cylinder}} dead locks (with an unlocked twist mechanism {{on the inside}} of the door) do not have this problem, and therefore are most commonly used on <b>fire</b> <b>exits.</b> Some areas have fire safety codes that do not allow a locked exit.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} reopened in April 2012 after 16 {{months of}} structural {{work on the}} <b>fire</b> <b>exit</b> of Pool 2, asbestos removal from the basement, and extensive cleaning and painting.|$|E
5000|$|In 2006, the City {{installed}} a new fire control system, a new <b>fire</b> <b>exit</b> sign {{and a new}} air conditioning system. The exterior of the [...] "City of Clinton" [...] and its paddle wheel were painted.|$|E
50|$|Today, {{it serves}} as a theatre <b>fire</b> <b>exit,</b> and can be busy with {{audience}} members during show-times and intermissions. One Shubert Alley, a souvenir shop, is located in a converted former dressing room of the Booth Theatre.|$|E
50|$|The factory was poorly {{designed}} and built. <b>Fire</b> <b>exits</b> drawn {{in the building}} plans were not, in fact, constructed, and the existing external doors were locked. The building was reinforced with uninsulated steel girders which quickly weakened and collapsed when heated by the flames.|$|R
50|$|Gradually {{functions}} such as {{the train}} depot, post office, and store were moved to different structures and the theater facilities were expanded. In 1898 the theater space was entirely reconfigured to have a sloped floor, balcony, and boxes flanking the proscenium stage, and more <b>fire</b> <b>exits.</b>|$|R
50|$|Because the {{dwellings}} {{are made}} of lightweight materials, they are not designed to withstand heavy storms and typhoons. Fire is also a danger, especially for buildings with a single exit versus a double exit. Buildings with single <b>fire</b> <b>exits</b> are tagged for top priority demolition due to the danger.|$|R

50|$|The Hospital {{provided}} accommodation for 65 patients. On {{the ground}} floor were situated three large, well-lighted wards, and a 20 bed wooden annexe, built by the Military when they moved in. The annex was {{on the east side}} of the house, out the <b>fire</b> <b>exit</b> in the regiment gallery.|$|E
5000|$|Around 2005 Matthews, {{working under}} the {{pseudonym}} [...] "Tramping Man", formed a musical collaboration named Burn Brothers with two London-based producers - Jean Philippe Altier and Adam Hoyle. They were joined by saxophonist Florian Brand and performed a number of gigs in and around London in 2007. A record entitled <b>Fire</b> <b>Exit</b> was recorded and released in April 2008.|$|E
