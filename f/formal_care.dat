50|$|As populations age, {{caring for}} people with {{dementia}} has become more common. Elderly caregiving may consist of <b>formal</b> <b>care</b> and informal care. <b>Formal</b> <b>care</b> involves the services of community and medical partners, while informal care involves the support of family, friends, and local communities, but more often from spouses, adult children and other relatives. In most mild to medium cases of dementia the primary caregiver is a family member, usually a spouse or adult child. Over time more and more professional care {{in the form of}} nursing and other supportive care may be required, whether at home or in a long term care facility.

There was a small association between attending <b>formal</b> child <b>care</b> and higher externalizing problems, especially when SES was low.

In 7 year-old boys and girls, the difference in heritability between the <b>formal</b> child <b>care</b> group of low SES and the home care group of high SES was 30 % for externalizing and ∼ 20 % for internalizing problems. The decrease in heritability was explained by a larger influence of the environment, rather than by a decrease in genetic variance. These results support a bioecological model in which heritability is lower in circumstances associated with more problem behavior. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media...|$|R

40|$|Whether {{informal}} {{family health}} care is a substitute or complement for <b>formal</b> health <b>care</b> has been debated in the literature. If it is a substitute, then there is a scope to reduce <b>formal</b> health <b>care</b> cost by promoting informal family health care. Using Korean survey data for the elderly of age 65 or higher, this paper estimates the effect of informal family health <b>care</b> on <b>formal</b> health <b>care,</b> where the former is measured by the number of family health care givers and the latter is measured by the (logarithm of) <b>formal</b> health <b>care</b> expenditure. This task, however, poses a number of difficulties. The first is that the number of the family care givers is an endogenous count regressor. The second is that there seem to be too many zeros in the count (85 %). The third is that the response variable also has a non-trivial proportion of zeros (14 %). This paper overcomes these problems by combining a semiparametric estimator for a censored response with the idea of â€œzero-inflatedâ€ counts. The resulting two-stage procedure avoids strong parametric assumptions and behaves well computationally. Our main empirical finding is that informal family health care has a large substitute effect for diabetics that is statistically significant and large in magnitude, but the other effects are statistically insignificant for our given data size of about 3000 informal health <b>care,</b> <b>formal</b> health <b>care,</b> count variable, zero-inflated Poisson, control function approach, censored model. ...|$|R

Design/Setting: Participants {{were part of a}} community-based prospective longitudinal study of 215 patients and their informal caregivers. Participants: Baseline data of a subsample of 215 patient-caregiver dyads were analyzed. Measurements: Analyses of covariance were performed to determine correlates of (in) <b>formal</b> <b>care</b> use assessed with the Resource Utilization in Dementia (RUD) -Lite questionnaire. Results: Informal care had a 3 : 1 ratio with <b>formal</b> <b>care.</b> Supervision/surveillance constituted the largest part of informal care. In more than half of cases, patients had only one informal caregiver. The amount of informal care was associated with disease severity, showing more informal care hours in advanced disease stages. Fewer informal care hours were related to more caregiver working hours, especially in younger patients. The amount of <b>formal</b> <b>care</b> was related to disease severity, behavioral problems, and initiative for activities of daily living. Conclusion: In EOD, it appears that family members provide most of the care. However, other social roles still have to be fulfilled. Especially in spousal caregivers of younger patients in advanced disease stages, there is a double burden of work and care responsibilities. This finding also indicates that even within the EOD group there might be important age-related differences.

40|$|Abstract Background Community-based programmes, {{particularly}} {{community health}} workers (CHWs), have been {{portrayed as a}} cost-effective alternative to the shortage of health workers in low-income countries. Usually, literature emphasises how easily CHWs link and connect communities to <b>formal</b> health <b>care</b> services. There is little evidence in Uganda to support or dispute such claims. Drawing from linking social capital framework, this paper examines the claim that village health teams (VHTs), {{as an example of}} CHWs, link and connect communities with <b>formal</b> health <b>care</b> services. Methods Data were collected through ethnographic fieldwork undertaken {{as part of a larger}} research program in Luwero District, Uganda, between 2012 and 2014. The main methods of data collection were participant observation in events organised by VHTs. In addition, a total of 91 in-depth interviews and 42 focus group discussions (FGD) were conducted with adult community members as part of the larger project. After preliminary analysis of the data, we conducted an additional six in-depth interviews and three FGD with VHTs and four FGD with community members on the role of VHTs. Key informant interviews were conducted with local government staff, health workers, local leaders, and NGO staff with health programs in Luwero. Thematic analysis was used during data analysis. Results The ability of VHTs to link communities with <b>formal</b> health <b>care</b> was affected by the stakeholders 2 ̆ 019 perception of their roles. Community members perceive VHTs as working for and under instructions of 2 ̆ 01 cothers 2 ̆ 01 d, which makes them powerless in the <b>formal</b> health <b>care</b> system. One of the challenges associated with VHTs 2 ̆ 019 linking roles is support from the government and <b>formal</b> health <b>care</b> providers. <b>Formal</b> health <b>care</b> providers perceived VHTs as interested in special recognition for their services yet they are not 2 ̆ 01 cexperts 2 ̆ 01 d. For some health workers, the introduction of VHTs is seen as a ploy by the government to control people and hide its inability to provide health services.

40|$|Objectives. The general aim of {{the article}} is to {{incorporate}} the stratification perspective into the study of (long-term) care systems. In particular, 3 issues are investigated: the extents to which (a) personal and family resources influence the likelihood of using <b>formal</b> <b>care</b> in later life; (b) the unequal access to <b>formal</b> <b>care</b> is mediated by differences in the availability of informal support; (c) the relationship between individuals’ resources {{and the use of}} <b>formal</b> <b>care</b> in old age varies across care regimes and is related to the institutional design of long-term care policies. Method. Data from Waves 1 and 2 of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe for 4 countries: Denmark, Germany, France, and Italy, and population aged at least 65 (N = 9, 824) were used. Population-averaged logit models were used. Results. Logit models revealed that in terms of access to formal care: an individual’s educational level plays a limited role; family networks function similarly across the countries studied; in general, financial wealth does not have a significant effect; there is a positive relation between income and the use of <b>formal</b> <b>care</b> in Germany and Italy, and no significant relation in France and Denmark; home ownership has a negative effect in Germany and Denmark. On accounting for informal care, inequality associated with individuals’ economic resources remains substantially unaltered. Discussion. The study shows that care systems based on services provision grant higher access to <b>formal</b> <b>care</b> and create lower inequalities. Moreover, countries where cash-for-care programs and family responsibilities are more important register inequalities in the use of <b>formal</b> <b>care.</b> Access to informal care does not mediate the distribution of <b>formal</b> <b>care...</b>|$|E
40|$|Several {{studies in}} high-income {{countries}} (HIC) {{have shown that}} the experience of potentially traumatic events (PTE) is associated with increased health care service use. Information on patterns of health care use and expectations by this group of individuals can be useful for providing patient-centric care and improving health system accountability and responsiveness. Despite the necessity of this work, less research has been conducted in low and lower-middle income countries (LIC; LMIC), especially in countries with a recent history of conflict, which is problematic for several reasons. Experience of PTEs, especially assaultive violence and injuries, may be higher in LICs and LMICs compared to HICs, which may lead to poor physical and mental health and increased demand for health care services. The formal health care system in LICs and LMICs, especially in those countries emerging from conflict, however, may be in a process of renewal and improvement. Many necessary health services may remain unavailable for several years during this process, accountability is often lacking, and the health system may not have the capacity to respond to health care needs. Likely stemming from this lack of <b>formal</b> <b>care,</b> many LICs and LMICs have substantial informal care markets, and most individuals view both systems as complementary, despite the complete lack of regulation and training of informal care providers compared to <b>formal</b> <b>care</b> providers. In order for the <b>formal</b> <b>care</b> system to improve accountability and responsiveness, studies that assess the relation between PTE experience and use of both informal and <b>formal</b> <b>care</b> as well as patient preferences for <b>formal</b> <b>care</b> are critical. Such studies would shed light on where individuals with PTE experience are seeking care and what they expect from <b>formal</b> <b>care.</b> I conducted three investigations in order to better understand the association between experience of PTEs and health care service use in LICs and LMICs. In chapter one, I designed a systematic review of studies published on the topic using data from LICs and LMICs. I found only two studies that met eligibility criteria and suggested several considerations that future studies make, including the use of validated scales to measure PTE experience and the importance of including informal care use in this research. In chapter two, using cross-sectional, population-based data on adults from Nimba County, Liberia, I assessed the relation between lifetime PTE experience and formal and informal care service use. Lifetime PTE experience increased both formal and informal care use and most persons who experienced PTEs likely complemented their formal use with informal use. One exception to this latter finding was a small group of individuals who used no informal care, among whom a higher number of PTEs was associated with using <b>formal</b> <b>care.</b> In chapter three, using data from a discrete choice experiment carried out on the same sample of adults from Nimba county, I found that those with increased experience of PTEs had a higher preference for a facility that offered a high quality exam, had a lower preference for respectful treatment, and a higher preference for seeing a traditional healer instead of using the facility to obtain care when sick. Most individuals with increased experience of PTEs used both the informal and <b>formal</b> <b>care</b> system to meet their health care needs. Their reliance on the informal care system may be partially explained by symptoms of psychopathology, poor physical health, easier access to medications, and dissatisfaction with the <b>formal</b> <b>care</b> system. Higher preferences for a high quality medical exam and the traditional healer compared to formal clinics among those with high PTE experience suggest that the expectations of those arguably most in need of health care may not currently be met by the <b>formal</b> <b>care</b> system. Considering that informal care providers are untrained and unregulated, they are unlikely to provide adequate health care that can decrease disease burden in the population. It is likely that use of informal care reflects inadequate formal care; the <b>formal</b> <b>care</b> system must become more responsive to the needs of those with PTEs. There are several factors related to the PTE experience - health care use relation that merit further attention as well as several improvements that the <b>formal</b> <b>care</b> system should consider. One factor is whether mental health is a central reason why those with PTEs seek informal care. Currently, <b>formal</b> <b>care</b> providers in Liberia are unable to adequately treat mental health problems, which may be one reason why individuals rely on informal care providers. Whether this is a determinant of informal care use should be assessed by future studies as, if this is the case, then any referral program in which informal providers refer patients to <b>formal</b> <b>care</b> may not prove successful. Training <b>formal</b> <b>care</b> providers in treating mental health problems should be implemented, but another aspect that merits further research is whether informal care providers like traditional healers can be trained to screen for mental health problems or provide limited counseling services for individuals prior to giving referrals to alleviate some of the burden on <b>formal</b> <b>care.</b> Another aspect of future research should compare the access, perceptions, and expectations of both care systems of those who use only <b>formal</b> <b>care</b> to those who use both. Identifying whether these individuals have better access to <b>formal</b> <b>care,</b> whether they view <b>formal</b> <b>care</b> differently, or whether they have less access to informal care may improve <b>formal</b> <b>care</b> system responsiveness. Lastly the government of Liberia should continue improving access to the nearest facility, training providers to perform better exams, and improving the quality of clinics, including increasing the availability of medications and decreasing wait times, as these changes will likely increase use of <b>formal</b> <b>care</b> services by those with PTEs as well as the larger population...|$|E

We propose a simple microeconomic model which describes the simultaneous decision process between potential informal caregivers and disabled elderly personliving at home. The model predicts a strict substitution between the two kinds of care. To test the substitution e ffect and assess its intensity, we estimate a recursive simultaneous equation model linked by a copula function, using data from the French Handicap Santé Ménages " survey (2008). In contrast with previous literature, the estimated model allows to simultaneously identify both potential causality directions. Thanks to thecopula function, strong assumptions about a linear link between the two residuals of both equations {{do not have to be}} made. Our results con firm that informal and formal home care are globally substitutes. Nevertheless, the predicted increase of <b>formal</b> <b>care</b> following a reduction of one hour of informal care remains very small. Informal care supply is also weakly sensitive to variations of <b>formal</b> <b>care</b> hours: The substitution e ffect is high only for individuals receiving much more informal than <b>formal</b> <b>care...</b>|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the relationship between migration {{and the use of}} formal maternal health-care services among rural women in Guatemala. We identify assimilation, diffusion, and remittances as three potential pathways through which migration can affect health-care service utilization in rural areas. Using data from the 1995 Guatemalan Survey of Family Health and multi-level regression models, we estimate the impact of migration experience at the individual, household, and community level on the use of <b>formal</b> prenatal <b>care</b> and delivery assistance. We find that urban migration experience and having relatives abroad are associated with a greater likelihood of <b>formal</b> prenatal <b>care</b> utilization, after taking account of background characteristics and enabling resources. Migration experience at all levels is also strongly associated with formal delivery assistance; however, this association operates primarily through the positive association between migration and enabling resources. The differential effects of out-migration on maternal health-care service utilization reflect the different barriers to service use that exist for <b>formal</b> prenatal <b>care</b> and delivery assistance. Financial cost and geographic access are the most important barriers to formal delivery assistance, whereas awareness and acceptance remain as important barriers to the use of <b>formal</b> prenatal <b>care</b> in rural Guatemala. Urban migration experience and social ties to urban and international migrants lower the barriers to formal maternal health-care utilization through the acquisition and diffusion of new ideas and practices, and the return flow of financial resources.
