40|$|We {{present an}} {{approach}} called pulsed multiline excitation (PME) for measurements of multicomponent, fluorescence species and demonstrate its application in capillary electrophoresis for DNA sequencing. To fully demonstrate {{the advantages of}} PME, a fluorescent <b>dye</b> <b>set</b> has been developed whose absorption maxima span virtually the entire visible spectrum. Unlike emission wavelength-dependent approaches for identifying fluorescent species, {{the removal of the}} spectral component in PME confers a number of advantages including higher and normalized signals from all dyes present in the assay, the elimination of spectral cross-talk between dyes, and higher signal collection efficiency. Base-calling is unambiguously determined once dye mobility corrections are made. These advantages translate into significantly enhanced signal quality as illustrated in the primary DNA sequencing data and provide a means for achieving accurate base-calling at lower reagent concentrations...|$|E
40|$|We have {{synthesized}} {{a set of}} four {{energy transfer}} dyes and demonstrated their use in automated DNA sequencing. The donor dyes are the 5 - or 6 -carboxy isomers of 4 ′-aminomethylfluorescein and the acceptor dyes are a novel set of four 4, 7 -dichloro-substituted rhodamine dyes which have narrower emission spectra than the standard, unsubstituted rhodamines. A rigid amino acid linker, 4 -aminomethylbenzoic acid, was used to separate the dyes. The brightness of each dye in an automated sequencing instrument equipped with a dual line argon ion laser (488 and 514 nm excitation) was 2 – 2. 5 {{times greater than the}} standard dye-primers with a 2 times reduction in multicomponent noise. The overall improvement in signal-to-noise was 4 - to 5 -fold. The utility of the new <b>dye</b> <b>set</b> was demonstrated by sequencing of a BAC DNA with an 80 kb insert. Measurement of the extinction coefficients and the relative quantum yields of the dichlororhodamine components of the energy transfer dyes showed their values were reduced by 20 – 25 % compared with the dichlororhodamine dyes alone...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} two new <b>dye</b> <b>sets</b> for {{automated}} dye-labeled terminator DNA sequencing. One set consists of four, 4, 7 -dichlororhodamine dyes (d-rhoda-mines). The second set consists of energy-transfer dyes {{that use the}} 5 -carboxy-d-rhodamine dyes as acceptor dyes and the 5 - or 6 -carboxy isomers of 4 ′-aminomethylfluorescein as the donor <b>dye.</b> Both <b>dye</b> <b>sets</b> utilize a new linker between the dye and the nucleotide, and both provide more even peak heights in terminator sequencing than the dye-terminators consisting of unsubstituted rhodamine dyes. The unsubstituted rhodamine terminators produced elec-tropherograms in which weak G peaks are observed after A peaks and occasionally C peaks. The number of weak G peaks has been reduced or eliminated with the new dye terminators. The general improvement in peak evenness improves accuracy for the automated base-calling software. The improved signal-to-noise ratio of the energy-transfer dye-labeled terminators combined with more even peak heights results in successful sequencing of high molecular weight DNA templates such as bacterial artificial chromosome DNA...|$|R

40|$|Eight {{treatments}} {{were evaluated}} for their effectiveness in the <b>setting</b> of <b>dyes</b> in new cotton fabrics. Dyes representing three application classes (direct, reactive, and vat) widely used on cotton fabrics were selected. Because {{of the perceived}} problems of red dyes bleeding during laundering, five of the eight dyes selected for evaluation were red. Color and staining evaluations were made after treatment and after laundering of the treated specimens {{to determine the effects}} of the treatments on color change and bleeding. The <b>dye</b> <b>setting</b> treatments did not cause large amounts of color change in the treated fabrics; however, none of the <b>dye</b> <b>setting</b> treatments significantly reduced color loss or staining during laundering for any of the dyes. Some of the treatments actually increased rather than decreased color loss and staining.

Although color is often the most influential factor in the salability of a product (Steams, 1974), the loss of or change in color during care and laundering is an important cause of consumer complaint (Nichols & Dardis, 1973; Wylie, Crown, & Morris, 1977). The large numbers of brightly colored cotton fabrics that have been marketed recently are no exception. The bright, fashionable colors and splashy designs appealed to the consumer and then, ironically, were often the first cause of complaint.

40|$|Many {{researchers}} {{today in}} the field of genomic research have found the use of large genomic fragment libraries, such as bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), to be crucial. New BAC libraries require a rapid and efficient method for characterization and assembly of clones into contigs that are then arrayed into physical maps of the chromosome. One widely used technique to generate these physical maps reflecting the sequence of chromosomes from contigs is by fingerprinting fragments of BACs generated from restriction enzymatic digests with fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotides ([F]ddNTPs). The ABI PRISM ® SNaPshot ® Multiplex System, a kit originally developed for SNP validation and screening, offers a readily available solution for BAC Fingerprinting application. Although the SNaPshot ® system currently does not have supported run modules on the Applied Biosystems 3730 / 3730 xl DNA Analyzers, the high throughput nature of BAC Fingerprinting has led many researchers to inquire about the possibility of running this application on a high throughput instrument like the 3730 / 3730 xl platforms.

40|$|Multiple {{immunophenotyping}} {{is aimed}} at identifying several cell populations in a single labeling procedure by their ability to bind combinations of specific labeled antibodies. The present work demonstrates the simultaneous discrimination by using image cytometry of aminomethylcoumarin acetate (AMCA), Lucifer yellow (LY), fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), R-phycoerythrin (PE), PE-Texas red tandem (Red 613), peridinin-chlorophyll protein (PerCP), and allophycocyanin (APC), which were all bound to latex beads as streptavidin-conjugated fluorochromes. This has {{been the result of}} a step-by-step optimization of the several factors affecting the sensitivity and specificity of multiple immunofluorescence analysis. First, 14 streptavidin-conjugated fluorochromes were evaluated by using spectrofluorometry. A primary selection was then made of ten spectrally separable dyes that could be evaluated by using image cytometry. These dyes were bound to latex particles, and specific filter combinations were assembled to minimize crosstalk between fluorophores while preserving sufficient fluorescence intensity and counting statistics. Potential probe associations were then assessed by measuring the emissions of all fluorochromes that were detected by each filter combination. The resulting crosstalk matrix served as the basic tool both for final selection of the optimal filter combination and for <b>dye</b> <b>set</b> (composed, in this case, of the seven fluorochromes described above) and for mathematical correction of residual spectral overlap. Next, an image cytometry system was adapted to collect seven images of matched brightness with the selected combination of excitation/emission filters and dichroic mirrors.
