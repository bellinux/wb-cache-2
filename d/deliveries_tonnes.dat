50|$|In 1864 Lafarge signed {{its first}} {{international}} {{contract for the}} <b>delivery</b> of 110,000 <b>tonnes</b> of lime to the Suez Canal construction project. In 1980 Lafarge joined with the Belgian coal, coke and fertilizer company Coppée to become SA Lafarge Coppée.|$|R
50|$|Next, the {{operators}} tried to extinguish the fire using carbon dioxide. The new gas-cooled Calder Hall reactors {{on the site}} had just received a <b>delivery</b> of 25 <b>tonnes</b> of liquid carbon dioxide and this was rigged up to the charge face of Windscale Pile 1, but there were problems getting it to the fire in useful quantities. The fire was so hot that it stripped the oxygen from what carbon dioxide could be applied.|$|R
50|$|During its deployment, 1RAR {{took part}} in seven major {{operations}} and on 17 February 1993, they had the first of 11 contacts with Somali gunmen. Approximately 1,100 foot patrols were undertaken whilst the battalion group was deployed, ensuring the safe <b>delivery</b> of 8,311 <b>tonnes</b> of humanitarian relief supplies. Additionally, 935 weapons including 544 rifles and 145 machine guns were seized. Seven Somali gunmen were killed, four were wounded and 70 were detained and {{turned over to the}} Auxiliary Security Forces. On 14 May 1993, the battalion handed responsibility for the Humanitarian Relief Sector to the French element of the United Nations Force. 1RAR returned to Australia on 22 May 1993 and marched through the streets of Townsville, Queensland.|$|R
50|$|Currently, {{the quality}} of the ore and the {{consequent}} cost and mass of equipment required to extract it are unknown and can only be speculated. Some economic analyses indicate that the cost of returning asteroidal materials to Earth far outweighs their market value, and that asteroid mining will not attract private investment at current commodity prices and space transportation costs. Other studies suggest large profit by using solar power. Potential markets for materials can be identified and profit generated if extraction cost is brought down. For example, the <b>delivery</b> of multiple <b>tonnes</b> of water to low Earth orbit for rocket fuel preparation for space tourism could generate a significant profit if space tourism itself proves profitable, which has not been proven.|$|R
25|$|The {{southern}} {{area of the}} Canvey Island West ward at Hole Haven has predominantly existed as petrochemical site {{since the}} first construction of an oil terminal there in 1936. In 1959, {{as part of a}} pioneering Anglo-American project designed to assess the viability of transporting liquefied natural gas overseas, a gas terminal with two one thousand tonne capacity storage tanks was constructed at the site alongside the oil terminal. The gas terminal built by the British Gas Council was designed to store and distribute imported gas to the whole of Britain via the facilities at Thames Haven and the local refinery at Shellhaven in Coryton. The first <b>delivery</b> of 2,020 <b>tonnes</b> arrived on 20 February 1959 from Lake Charles, Louisiana by a specially modified liberty ship Normarti renamed The Methane Pioneer. The success of seven further deliveries over the following 14 months established the international industry for transporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) by sea, but the discovery of oil and gas in North Sea limited further British development. Canvey continued to receive 50 shipments of LNG per year from Arzew Algeria, until about 1984, British gas closed the site in 1994.|$|R
50|$|An {{agreement}} between the NUM and ISTC over <b>deliveries</b> of 15,700 <b>tonnes</b> of coal per week to the plant at Scunthorpe broke down after {{an explosion in the}} Queen Mary furnace at the plant on 21 May 1984. It took two hours to douse the flames and a further eight hours to stop the liquid iron bursting through the brickwork. This was considered a result of the poor quality of coal supplies. Attempts by the ISTC to persuade the NUM to deliver more coal did not bring immediate results, with the divisional official Roy Bishop writing on both the physical dangers to the workers by the Queen Mary and the possibility of irreversible damage to the blast furnace. As the NUM did not respond immediately, the British Steel Commission decided to act quickly to find alternative supplies. The Commission ordered a large consignment of coal from Poland to be delivered to Flixborough in Lincolnshire, and spoke to every haulage company it had ever used to arrange for non-unionised hauliers to transport the coal. In addition, an order was made for 5,000 tonnes of top-quality coke to be delivered from Orgreave to Scunthorpe.|$|R

2500|$|President Pohamba has {{declared}} a state of emergency across six northern districts, and has requested international assistance. [...] The Namibian state relief fund has been active in the region delivering water, food, tents and other supplies to flooded areas by helicopter and motorboat. [...] However it is hindered by a shortage of both aircraft and boats, and is running out of funding. [...] The Red Cross agencies in both Angola and Namibia have responded to the disaster. [...] The Angola Red Cross is distributing mosquito nets, water purification tablets and rehydration sachets and the Namibia Red Cross Society has been distributing chlorine tablets and promoting hygiene in the affected areas. [...] The World Health Organization has also responded with the <b>delivery</b> of five <b>tonnes</b> of health care kits and supplies of drinking water. [...] There are fears that the global financial crisis may limit the effectiveness of aid agencies who are already over-stretched across Africa. [...] Displaced persons camps have been established in Oshana, Oshikoto, Ohangwena and Omusati in Namibia and currently hold around 4,500 people although they are said to be overcrowded and lacking in fresh water and sanitaion provision. [...] The World Health Organisation has sent several healthcare teams into the area to train emergency personnel and to provide expertise in disease prevention. [...] The floods coincided with a visit to Angola by Pope Benedict XVI, who expressed solidarity with the flood victims and encouraged reconstruction efforts. [...] The Namibian national power company, NamPower, has donated food worth N$50,000 to those who have lost their homes in the areas near to Ruacana Hydro-electric Power Station which accounts for 70% of the country's electricity needs. [...] The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has launched an appeal for $1.3 million to fund relief operations to assist 20,000 people in Namibia.|$|R
5000|$|For the 800,000 Luftwaffe {{personnel}} on the Eastern Front, Seidel {{was able}} to work with Milch to secure extra woollen underwear, fur boots, and other winter wear. However, beginning in October 1942 during the Battle of Stalingrad, Seidel sought desperately to find enough aircraft to supply the surrounded Sixth Army by air-the Junkers Ju 52 transports of Luftflotte 4 (Air Fleet 4) were not sufficient, and Hitler had ordered the army to stand and fight. On 23 November, Seidel ordered all German ministry, training, and staff aircraft of any size to join the airlift into Stalingrad. Some 600 aircraft flown by highly skilled instructors were taken from training facilities and sent east, with the result that some specialized training schools were closed. Aircraft as various as Heinkel He 111 bombers, Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor reconnaissance patrol bombers, Junkers Ju 90 airliners, and Junkers Ju 86 trainers were pressed into airlift service. Many that arrived at eastern air bases were pushed aside as useless until they could be winterized. By 19 December, the collection of aircraft were at their peak of <b>delivery,</b> with 289 <b>tonnes</b> of supplies dropped in 154 sorties on that day. The Sixth Army needed 700-800 tonnes each day, with food and munitions as top priority, but they received only a fraction of that, and some deliveries such as spices and summer clothing were completely useless to the troops. Severe winter conditions and unrelenting Soviet attacks took a heavy toll of the ground and air forces. Some 488 aircraft were lost along with some 1,000 of the Luftwaffe finest airmen. Seidel noted the great equipment losses in that theatre: [...] "Of 100,000 Luftwaffe vehicles in the East, only 15 per cent still functioning early in January 1942." [...] The aircraft evacuated 42,000 men, mostly wounded, with the last one flown out on 24 January 1943. The Sixth Army surrendered on 3 February.|$|R
