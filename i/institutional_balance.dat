Both models generate midterm cycles in which the President's party usually loses vote share at midterm.

40|$|The {{continuity}} of stable peace in East Asia, especially Southeast Asia, {{since the end}} of the Cold War raises one major question: why is there no apparent balancing behaviour against China, the emerging great power in East Asia? In response to this question, exceptionalists argue that there will be no balancing behaviour against China from Southeast Asian states, while soft balancing theorists argue that the balancing behaviour has already occurred in the form of <b>institutional</b> <b>balancing.</b> This article refutes those arguments and maintains that balancing behaviour is not yet apparent in Southeast Asian balancing, yet it exists in an indirect form.

I consider three evolutionary models, including two that involve partisan cuing. Simulations using National Election Studies data from presidential years 1976 [...] 96 suggest that many voters use an unconditional strategy, usually a strategy of voting a straight ticket matching their party identification. I then estimate a choice model that incorporates an approximation to the evolutionary dynamics. The results support partisan cuing and confirm that most voters vote unconditionally.

The general assumption underlying this more diversified use of legal instruments is that this contributes to the legitimacy, effectiveness and transparency of Community action and, as such, to good governance. This assumption raises doubts, however, from various perspectives. This contribution focuses on one such perspective, i. e. that of the horizontal division of powers or <b>institutional</b> <b>balance</b> between the EU institutions; to what extent does the use of soft law by one institution entail an unacceptable bypassing of the competences of the other institutions in the decision-making process? In dealing with this question, the author among other things looks into the concept and classification of EC soft law, the competence to adopt soft law and the limits that can be placed upon this competence, the meaning of ‘legitimacy’ and of ‘institutional balance’, the existing guarantees for protecting the <b>institutional</b> <b>balance</b> in this regard and changes that may be required...|$|E

How can that differentiation between legislative and implementing legal acts be made operational? How could an effective system of control be established that limits the implementing powers of the Commission and safeguards the prerogatives of the legislators, especially Parliament?

Rather, bureaucratic organization is part of a repertoire of overlapping, supplementary, and competing forms coexisting in contemporary democracies, and so are market-organization and network-organization.

40|$|The {{question}} of the “institutional balance” strikes at {{the very core of}} what the European Union is and where it is headed. In Declaration 23 of the Treaty of Nice, member states committed themselves to launching “a deeper and wider debate {{about the future of the}} Union” (point 3). As the articles in this volume indicate, in addressing the future of the Union, it is crucial that member states and the institutions dispel the myths upon which some of the need for reform has been conceived. In any institutional reform process, it is vital that the architects of reform avoid what Demsetz has referred to as the “Nirvana fallacy. ” In examining the <b>institutional</b> <b>balance(s)</b> in the EU and addressing the future of the Union, it is important that the realities of contemporary praxis are fully understood and that unrealistic goals are avoided.

40|$|In {{the debate}} {{about the impact of the}} eurozone crisis on the EU’s <b>institutional</b> <b>balance,</b> antagonists have often argued past each other. Supporters of the new intergovernmentalism contend that the European Council has supplanted the European Commission in policy leadership, while {{scholars}} who hold that the EU executive has been a winner of the crisis highlight the new management functions it has acquired. This article argues, first, that an accurate assessment of the <b>institutional</b> <b>balance</b> requires a more global evaluation of the Commission, acknowledging external and internal dynamics. Second, it contends that the crisis did not cause a Commission retreat but accelerated a process already underway that finds its origins in the presidentialisation of policy control. The adoption of fewer legislative proposals during the crisis was due to the ability and choice of a strong president to focus the attention on crisis-related areas. The broader lesson is that rather than marking a further step in the decline of the Commission, the crisis reveals how the centralisation of power within the institution and its expanded management duties have enhanced its capacity to take strategic action. The Commission’s role as an engine of integration will therefore endure, but in a different guise...|$|E

40|$|In many European countries, {{since the}} World War II, {{there has been}} a trend towards {{decentralization}} of health policy to lower levels of governments, while more recently there have been re-centralization processes. Whether re-centralization will be the new paradigm of European health policy or not is difficult to say. In the Italian National Health Service (SSN) decentralization raised two related questions that might be interesting for the international debate on decentralization in health care: (a) what sort of regulatory framework and <b>institutional</b> <b>balances</b> are required to govern decentralization in health care in a heterogeneous country under tough budget constraints? (b) how can it be ensured that the most advanced parts of the country remain committed to solidarity, supporting the weakest ones? To address these questions this article describes the recent trends in SSN funding and expenditure, it reviews the strategy adopted by the Italian government for governing the decentralization process and discusses the findings to draw policy conclusions. The main lessons emerging from this experience are that: (1) when the differences in administrative and policy skills, in socio-economic standards and social capital are wide, decentralization may lead to undesirable divergent evolution paths; (2) even in decentralized systems, the role of the Central government can be very important to contain health expenditure; (3) a strong governance of the Central government may help and not hinder the enforcement of decentralization; and (4) supporting the weakest Regions and maintaining inter-regional solidarity is hard but possible. In Italy, despite an increasing role of the Central government in steering the SSN, the pattern of regional decentralization of health sector decision making does not seem at risk. Nevertheless, the Italian case confirms the complexity of decentralization and re-centralization processes that sometimes can be paradoxically reinforcing each other.
