5|$|General {{relativity}} {{includes a}} dynamical spacetime, {{so it is}} <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how to identify the conserved energy and momentum. Noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.|$|E

The film depicts Lightoller informing Captain Smith {{that it will}} be <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> icebergs without {{breaking}} water. He is seen brandishing a gun and threatening to use it to keep order. He can be seen on top of Collapsible B when the first funnel collapses. Lightoller was the most senior officer to have survived the disaster.|$|E
5|$|Thelephora palmata is an ectomycorrhizal species, forming mutualistic {{associations}} with conifers. Fruit bodies grow singly, scattered, or in {{groups on the}} ground in both coniferous and mixed forest and grassy fields. A preference has been noted for moist ground, and locations along woodland paths. An uncommon species, fruit bodies can be <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> because they blend well into their surroundings.|$|E

5|$|Although most U.S. {{aircraft}} losses {{continued to}} be inflicted by anti-aircraft fire, U.S. Air Force F-105s and Navy A-4 Skyhawks increasingly encountered SAMs and MiGs. North Vietnamese fighters also became a particular problem {{because of the lack}} of radar coverage in the Red River Delta region, which allowed the MiGs to surprise the strike forces. Airborne early warning aircraft had difficulty detecting the fighters at low altitudes and the aircraft themselves were <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> visually.|$|E
5|$|At these speeds, it was {{expected}} that the B-70 would be almost immune to interceptor aircraft, the only effective weapon against bomber aircraft at the time. The bomber would spend only a few minutes over a particular radar station, flying out of its range before the controllers could position their fighters in a suitable location for an interception. High speed also made the aircraft <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> on radar displays and its high-altitude flight could not be matched by any contemporary Soviet fighter.|$|E
5|$|Bethesda Softworks {{developed}} a spin-off iOS game, Dishonored: Rat Assassin, which it released {{free of charge}} on 30 August 2012. The game requires players to use a knife and crossbow to kill rats while avoiding bombs. Rat Assassin was well received for the variety and quantity of content provided, but received some criticism for dark visuals, that made it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the rats. The game drew frequent comparisons to another mobile game, Fruit Ninja.|$|E

5|$|Bombing of Normandy began {{around midnight}} {{with more than}} 2,200 British, Canadian, and American bombers attacking targets along the coast and further inland. The coastal bombing attack was largely {{ineffective}} at Omaha, because low cloud cover made the assigned targets <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> Concerned about inflicting casualties on their own troops, many bombers delayed their attacks too long and failed to hit the beach defences. The Germans had 570 aircraft stationed in Normandy and the Low Countries on D-Day, and another 964 in Germany.|$|E
5|$|Holy Trinity Church on Boar Lane was {{constructed}} between 1721 and 1727, built to a design by William Etty. It is a Grade I listed building. The building {{has not changed}} much (although a new steeple was built in 1839 by R D Chantrell), but developments such as the Burton Arcade and the Leeds Shopping Plaza have been built so close that it is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the full exterior of the building as was once possible.|$|E

5|$|As the long-tailed {{ground roller}} is remarkably silent and <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> during the non-breeding season, the local {{inhabitants}} of Madagascar once {{believed that this}} bird hibernated in its burrows. While not particularly tasty, this species is hunted for food due to its large size and the relative ease of capture compared with arboreal birds. In the early twentieth century, it was hunted by herdsmen with blowguns. In the 1950s and 1960s, natives trapped this ground roller and dug out its nesting burrows. This bird has been featured on several of Madagascar's stamps. Only one zoo, Germany's Weltvogelpark Walsrode, keeps this species. It is considered by birdwatchers {{to be one of}} the world's most elusive birds.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its small}} size and {{location}} {{away from the}} plane of the Milky Way, Caelum is rather devoid of deep-sky objects, and contains no Messier objects. The only deep-sky object in Caelum to receive much attention is HE0450-2958, an unusual Seyfert galaxy. Originally, the jet's host galaxy proved elusive to find, and this jet appeared to be emanating from nothing. Although {{it has been suggested that}} the object is an ejected supermassive black hole, the host is now agreed to be a small galaxy that is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> due to light from the jet and a nearby starburst galaxy.|$|E
5|$|The Bourne Identity was {{followed}} by a 2004 sequel, The Bourne Supremacy, which received a similar positive critical and public reception, but received some criticism for its hand-held camerawork, which observers argued made action sequences <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> The Bourne Supremacy was directed by Paul Greengrass with Matt Damon reprising his role as Jason Bourne. A third film, The Bourne Ultimatum, was released in 2007 and again was directed by Paul Greengrass and starred Matt Damon. Like Supremacy, Ultimatum received generally positive critical and public reception, but also received similar criticism for the camera-work. Liman remained as executive producer for both films {{as well as for the}} fifth film Jason Bourne, once again directed by Greengrass and released in 2016.|$|E

5|$|The European {{nightjar}}, Eurasian nightjar or just nightjar (Caprimulgus europaeus) is a crepuscular and {{nocturnal bird}} in the nightjar family that breeds across most of Europe and temperate Asia. The Latin generic name refers to the old myth that the nocturnal nightjar suckled goats, causing them to cease to give milk. The six subspecies differ clinally, the birds becoming smaller and paler towards {{the east of the}} range. All populations are migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa. Their densely patterned grey and brown plumage makes individuals <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> in the daytime when they rest on the ground or perch motionless along a branch, although the male shows white patches in the wings and tail as he flies at night.|$|E
5|$|The Milky Way has a {{relatively}} low surface brightness. Its visibility can be greatly reduced by background light such as light pollution or stray light from the Moon. The sky needs to be darker than about 20.2 magnitude per square arcsecond {{in order for the}} Milky Way to be seen. It should be visible when the limiting magnitude is approximately +5.1 or better and shows a great deal of detail at +6.1. This makes the Milky Way <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> from any brightly lit urban or suburban location, but very prominent when viewed from a rural area when the Moon is below the horizon. The new world atlas of artificial night sky brightness shows that more than one-third of Earth's population cannot see the Milky Way from their homes due to light pollution.|$|E
5|$|The {{church was}} now under a rector, who {{replaced}} the lay abbot; and any remaining priests of the clas and their abod were presumably expelled. If one accepts {{the evidence of}} the inquisition taken before Rhys ap Gruffydd, lieutenant of the Justiciar, at Llanfihangel Genau'r Glyn, 1 September 1326 (which conflicts with Gerald's account), as early as 1212 there were apparently only two monks (from St Peter's, Gloucester) in residence. However, it is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how they can have remained, in light of Welsh control of the area; possibly they had only arrived in 1211; we don't know whether there was a priest resident (one of the monks might have been a priest).|$|E

5|$|The {{skirmish}} {{became a}} full-scale battle by 4:00p.m. After the Americans drove Captain Pipe's Delawares {{out of the}} woods and onto to prairie, the Delawares were reinforced by Dunquat's Wyandots. Elliott also arrived on the scene and coordinated the actions of the Delawares and the Wyandots. Pipe's Delawares skillfully outflanked the American position and then attacked their rear. A few Indians crept close to the American lines in the tall prairie grass. The Americans responded by climbing trees to get a better shot at them. Gunsmoke filled the air, making it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> After {{three and a half hours}} of incessant firing, the Indians gradually broke off the attack with the approach of nightfall. Both sides slept with arms at the ready, and surrounded their positions with large fires to prevent surprise night attacks.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft {{camouflage}} {{is the use}} of camouflage {{on military}} aircraft to make them more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> whether on the ground or in the air. Given the possible backgrounds and lighting conditions, no single scheme works in every situation. A common approach has been a form of countershading, the aircraft being painted in a disruptive pattern of ground colors such as green and brown above, sky colors below. For faster and higher-flying aircraft, sky colors have sometimes been used all over, while helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft used close to the ground are often painted entirely in ground camouflage. Aircraft flying by night have often been painted black, but this actually made them appear darker than the night sky, leading to paler night camouflage schemes. There are trade-offs between camouflage and aircraft recognition markings, and between camouflage and weight. Accordingly, visible light camouflage has been dispensed with when air superiority was not threatened or when no significant aerial opposition was anticipated.|$|E
5|$|All lemurs {{experience}} some predation pressure. Common defenses against predation {{include the use}} of alarm calls and predator mobbing, mostly among diurnal lemurs. The leaping abilities of lemurs may have evolved for predator avoidance rather than for travel, according to a study in kinematics. Nocturnal lemurs are <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> and track at night and decrease their visibility by foraging alone. They also try to avoid predators by using concealing sleeping locations, such as nests, tree holes, or dense vegetation, Some may also avoid areas frequented by predators by detecting the smell of their feces. and alternating between multiple sleeping locations. Even torpor and hibernation states among cheirogaleids may be partly due to high levels of predation. Infants are protected while foraging by either leaving them in the nest or by stashing them in a hidden location, where the infant remains immobile {{in the absence of the}} parent.|$|E
