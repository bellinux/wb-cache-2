[...] Both the blind bidding process for hosting tournament matches {{and the manner in}} which MLS teams {{qualified}} for the tournament were widely criticized. [...] An example of the concerns raised around hosting came from FC Dallas midfielder Daniel Hernandez on Twitter, where he complained about Seattle's home-field advantage throughout the 2011 tournament. [...] Following the final, MLS and U.S. Soccer officials met to discuss rule changes to the tournament's host bidding system and team qualification processes. [...] Sounders FC owner Adrian Hanauer commented on the changes and the possibility of raising the profile of the tournament, [...] "I don’t think the bidding process <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the profile of the tournament, necessarily. It might make a few people happy, it might make a few people unhappy. But ultimately, I’m not convinced that’s what is going to raise the profile." ...|$|E

He won the August 15, 2006, Republican primary handily, defeating state senator Bob Beers and Lieutenant Governor Lorraine Hunt. In the general election (described as [...] "most contentious, ugly and negative in history") he faced Democratic nominee Dina Titus, who was the Minority Leader in the Nevada State Senate. Gibbons received 278,984 votes to Titus's 255,675. Titus won Clark County, Nevada's most populous, but Gibbons won every other county. Gibbons called Titus [...] "an admirable opponent", although Titus declined to echo his sentiments, saying [...] "We disagree on basic policies, and neither one of us <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> our minds for the other".|$|E

When he suffers a heart attack during this chat, she makes no effort to help him. He dies within hours, without anyone knowing his plan and before changing his will. This leaves Regina free to blackmail her brothers by threatening to report Leo's theft unless they give her 75% ownership in the cotton mill (it is, in Regina's mind, a fair exchange for the stolen bonds). The price Regina ultimately pays for her evil deeds is the loss of her daughter Alexandra's love and respect. Regina's actions cause Alexandra to finally understand the importance of not idly watching people do evil. She tells Regina she will not watch her be [...] "one who eats the earth," [...] and abandons her. Having let her husband die, alienated her brothers, and driven away her only child, Regina is left wealthy but completely alone.|$|E

Golaud notices Mélisande is trembling and tells her {{he is not going to}} kill her with the sword. He mocks the [...] "great innocence" [...] Arkel says he sees in Mélisande's eyes. He commands her to close them or [...] "I will shut them for a long time." [...] He tells Mélisande that she disgusts him and drags her around the room by her hair.

2500|$|According to Yorke, {{many of his}} {{lyrics are}} {{motivated}} by anger, expressing his political and environmental concerns, and written as [...] "a constant response to doublethink". The lyrics of the 2003 Radiohead album Hail to the Thief dealt with what he called [...] "the general sense of ignorance and intolerance and panic and stupidity" [...] following the 2000 election of US President George W. Bush and the unfolding War on Terror. Yorke wrote his 2006 solo single [...] "Harrowdown Hill" [...] about David Kelly, a whistleblower who allegedly committed suicide after telling a reporter that the British government had falsely identified weapons of mass destructions in Iraq. In a 2008 television performance of [...] "House of Cards", Yorke dedicated the chorus lyric, [...] "denial, denial", to Bush for rejecting the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty to reduce greenhouse gases. Despite his political concerns, in a November 2015 interview with the activist and writer George Monbiot, he said: [...] "In the 60s, you could write songs that were like calls to arms, and it would work. It’s much harder to do that now ... If I was {{going to write a}} protest song about climate change in 2015, it would be shit.

The storyline involves a flipped car and a helicopter, from which a birds-eye view of the crash scene is seen. It is reported to have cost £1million to make, said to be the most expensive stunt EastEnders has ever filmed. The crash was filmed over two days and was directed by Michael Owen Morris, who had to create what was originally scripted as [...] "car hits wall" [...] and compared it to a James Bond film. Newman said the crash was [...] "A suitably explosive start to a jam-packed autumn and winter full of love, romance and reprisals", while a show insider said, [...] "The crash <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> things for many residents in Albert Square.

[...] Dyer said in the Daily Star that he was not nervous joining EastEnders, but that he was excited and [...] "can't wait for everyone to see me in the Vic", joking that he hoped his character would not have sex with Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace). The programme had suffered falling ratings in 2013, and Dyer told Inside Soap that he wanted to [...] "help turn EastEnders around". When asked by Heat if he would be [...] "the saviour" [...] of EastEnders, he said that he would, and said, [...] "a lot of people were excited about me going to EastEnders [...] there's a lot of people who want to see me fail", adding that it was a risk that [...] "could work or couldn't work".

It leaves out the French and the Italians and the Belgians and all our blood brotherhood of allies. It has no compelling force in it. We British are not naturally Imperialist; we are something greater--or something less. For two years and a half now we have been fighting against Imperialism in its most extravagant form.
