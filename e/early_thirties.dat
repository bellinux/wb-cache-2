5|$|Aristocratic Heian women lived {{restricted}} and secluded lives, {{allowed to}} speak to men only when they were close relatives or household members. Murasaki's autobiographical poetry shows that she socialized with women but had limited contact with men other than her father and brother; she often exchanged poetry with women but never with men. Unlike most noblewomen of her status, she did not marry on reaching puberty; instead she stayed in her father's household until her mid-twenties or perhaps even to her <b>early</b> <b>thirties.</b>|$|E

5|$|MS usually {{appears in}} adults {{in their late}} twenties or <b>early</b> <b>thirties</b> but it can rarely start in {{childhood}} and after 50 years of age. The primary progressive subtype {{is more common in}} people in their fifties. Similar to many autoimmune disorders, the disease is more common in women, and the trend may be increasing. As of 2008, globally it is about two times more common in women than in men. In children, it is even more common in females than males, while in people over fifty, it affects males and females almost equally.|$|E

During its release weekend, the film mostly attracted a young audience ranging from teenagers to those in their <b>early</b> <b>thirties.</b> Among this demographic, males were outnumbered by females {{at a ratio of}} 2:3 which suggested that the original game itself was mostly popular among women. In addition a significant number of patrons who were not familiar with the game were also present during the release weekend.|$|E
5|$|Born in 1933 in Anderson, Indiana, Phyllis Reynolds Naylor {{was raised}} in Indiana and Illinois in the 1930s during the Great Depression. During her {{childhood}} she was hardly given any toys. Instead, with her parents reading to her every night, books formed {{a major part of}} her early years—"the happiest part". Her parents read a variety of literature to her, including Bible stories, The Wind in the Willows, and Mark Twain's novels, until she was 14. After she became a parent, she read to her children in the mornings because of their evening activities. At 16, Naylor wrote a short story for a church magazine, and in her <b>early</b> <b>thirties</b> she published her first book. She has published over 100 books. When she wrote and published Shiloh, her 65th novel, she was living in Bethesda, Maryland with her husband Rex, a speech pathologist whom she married in May 1960. She has two adult sons and four grandchildren.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} centuries AD, Palmyra {{was a city}} {{subordinate}} to Rome {{and part of the}} province of Syria Phoenice. In 260 the Roman emperor Valerian marched against the Sassanid Persian monarch Shapur I, who had invaded the empire's eastern regions; Valerian was defeated and captured near Edessa. Odaenathus, formally loyal to Rome and its emperor Gallienus (Valerian's son), was declared king of Palmyra. Launching successful campaigns against Persia, he was crowned King of Kings of the East in 263. Odaenathus crowned his eldest son, Herodianus, as co-ruler. In addition to the royal titles, Odaenathus received many Roman titles, most importantly corrector totius orientis (governor of the entire East), and ruled the Roman territories from the Black Sea to Palestine. In 267, when Zenobia was in her late twenties or <b>early</b> <b>thirties,</b> Odaenathus and his eldest son were assassinated while returning from a campaign.|$|E
5|$|The book {{consists}} of twelve chapters, plus an Epilogue and an Acknowledgements section at the end. Smith and MacKinnon individually write alternating chapters, {{each of which}} covers one month from March 2005 to February 2006. In the first chapter MacKinnon tells how his idea for the 100-mile diet began and Smith agrees to try it for one year. They begin symbolically {{on the first day}} of Spring, March 21, and define 'local' as 100 miles, a convenient radius that would include the Lower Mainland, the southern half of Vancouver Island, and Whatcom County and Skagit County in Washington State. Their exceptions to this rule include meals eaten while traveling, meals prepared by friends, and business lunches. Their initial month was expensive as they scoured grocery stores for whatever they could find. In the second chapter, Smith describes her and MacKinnon as an unwed urban couple in their <b>early</b> <b>thirties</b> with no children and living in a rented apartment. They recount how eating impacted their relationship before and after the diet, the anonymity of prepackaged foods, the traceability of their diet, and the diets of the Coast Salish.|$|E

25|$|In {{more recent}} times, {{the burning of}} homes was used to devastating effect in the War of the Grand Alliance in the 17th century, during which Louis XIV of France ordered the {{systematic}} destruction of the German cities of Bingen, Heidelberg, Mannheim, Oppenheim, Spier and Worms (while sparing the cathedrals). Germany had suffered even more extensively in the <b>earlier</b> <b>Thirty</b> Years' War, in which as much as two-thirds of German real estate is estimated to have been destroyed and reconstruction took as long as fifty years. During the American Civil War, the burning of Atlanta, Georgia and Sherman's March to the Sea in 1864 provided large-scale examples {{of the use of}} house demolition as a means of wrecking the enemy's economy.|$|R

40|$|The {{diagnostic}} analyses executed on {{the painting}} “Madonna con Bambino e Santi Girolamo e Caterina da Siena”, ascribed to Beccafumi by Zeri in 1995, and datable, for stylistic considerations, in the <b>early</b> <b>thirty</b> years in 1500, allowed to analyse the executive technique, to confirm the attribution to the Sienese painter and to evaluate the preservation conditions. Diagnostic analyses have been executed by: reflectography, videomicroscopy, X-rays radiography, X-rays fluorescence spectroscopy. Analyses with gas cromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) have been executed on micro-fragments to investigate the nature of binders. The painting, not in very good conservation conditions, shows a significant degradation process in act. Effects of old and radical cleanings appear evident: these, probably, intended to solve some problems in the Beccafumi’s pictorial technique: he used to paint very quickly, leaving typical colour drippings.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to quantitatively and qualitatively estimate the effect of keratin essence on hair protection against physicochemical damage. Damaged hairs were obtained from an <b>early</b> <b>thirty</b> woman who dyed her hair two times and did digital permanent treatment of her hair two times. The damaged hairs were divided into four experimental groups, which are the control hair (CH) group without additional beauty treatment, the damaged hair (DH) group by additional dyeing treatment, basic essence-treated hair (BEH) group, and keratin essence-treated hair (KEH) groups according to the research goal. The protection effect of keratin essence against the physicochemical damage was quantitatively compared by difference of chrominance measured using a color difference meter and qualitatively compared by difference of outer morphological structure images pictured using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The brightness and yellowish blue color of KEH were relatively lower but the reddish blue color was relatively higher than other groups of test hairs. Cuticle structure of the previously DH was irregularly deforme...|$|R
