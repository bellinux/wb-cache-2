50|$|Traditionally playlists {{have been}} {{composed}} of <b>file</b> <b>paths</b> that pointed to individual titles. This allowed a playlist {{to be played}} locally on one machine or shared if the listed <b>file</b> <b>paths</b> were URLs accessible {{to more than one}} machine (e.g., on the Web). XSPF's meta-data rich open format has permitted a new kind of playlist sharing called content resolution.|$|R
50|$|To {{locate a}} file, the {{directory}} {{names in the}} <b>file's</b> <b>path</b> can be checked sequentially, going {{to the location of}} each directory to obtain the location of the subsequent subdirectory. However, a file can also be located through the path table provided by the <b>file</b> system. This <b>path</b> table stores information about each directory, its parent and its location on disk. Since the path table is stored in a contiguous region, it can be searched much faster than jumping to the particular locations of each directory in the <b>file's</b> <b>path,</b> thus reducing seek time.|$|R
50|$|Like {{almost all}} IBM-provided {{management}} tools, software tools do not respect long established OS conventions for packaging, <b>file</b> <b>paths</b> and naming.|$|R
5000|$|The {{contents}} of [...] {{must be in}} the format of a valid <b>file</b> <b>path,</b> with six trailing 'X's.|$|E
5000|$|OS loaders can be {{automatically}} {{detected by}} UEFI, which enables easy booting from removable {{devices such as}} USB flash drives. This automated detection relies on standardized file paths to the OS loader, with the path varying depending on the computer architecture. The format of the <b>file</b> <b>path</b> is defined as for example, the <b>file</b> <b>path</b> to the OS loader on an x86-64 system is [...] and efi\boot\bootaa64.efi on ARM64 architecture.|$|E
5000|$|... on Windows, the {{directory}} structure has a Windows syntax, and each <b>file</b> <b>path</b> must be {{separated by a}} semicolon (";").|$|E
50|$|TNEF {{attachments}} {{can contain}} security-sensitive {{information such as}} user login name and <b>file</b> <b>paths,</b> from which access controls could possibly be inferred.|$|R
5000|$|Since version 3.41 (December 2004), WinRAR adds {{support for}} Linux [...]Z {{archives}} like GZIP and BZIP2. New options include storing entire <b>file</b> <b>paths</b> and restoring compressed NTFS files.|$|R
5000|$|... on all Unix-like {{operating}} systems (such as Linux and Mac OS X), the directory structure has a Unix syntax, with separate <b>file</b> <b>paths</b> {{separated by a}} colon (":").|$|R
5000|$|Some {{programs}} do not work properly with redirected profile folders that refer to a UNC <b>file</b> <b>path</b> on a server share: \\server\share\username\Application Data ...|$|E
50|$|The name of {{the file}} to open. It {{includes}} the <b>file</b> <b>path</b> defining where, in which file system, the file is found (or should be created).|$|E
5000|$|This {{does not}} apply when the Classpath is defined in {{manifest}} files, where each <b>file</b> <b>path</b> must be separated by a space (" [...] "), regardless of the operating system.|$|E
5000|$|Some affix <b>file</b> <b>paths</b> to filenames only, {{as if all}} {{files in}} a CAB archive are in a single folder. IExpress works this way, as does Microsoft Windows Explorer, which can open CAB {{archives}} as a folder.|$|R
50|$|A {{symbolic}} link is {{a reference to}} another file. This special file is stored as a textual representation of the referenced <b>file's</b> <b>path</b> (which means the destination may be a relative path, or may not exist at all).|$|R
5000|$|<b>File</b> <b>paths</b> {{monitored}} - Up to Windows XP, {{files are}} backed up only from certain directories. On Windows Vista and later, {{this set of}} files is defined by monitored extensions outside of the Windows folder, and everything under the Windows folder.|$|R
5000|$|Information on the [...] "active" [...] and [...] "passive" [...] panels may be {{used for}} {{constructing}} commands on the command line. Examples include current <b>file,</b> <b>path</b> to left panel, path to right panel, etc.|$|E
50|$|Object storage {{also allows}} the {{addressing}} and identification of individual objects {{by more than}} just file name and <b>file</b> <b>path.</b> Object storage adds a unique identifier within a bucket, or across the entire system, to support much larger namespaces and eliminate name collisions.|$|E
5000|$|Starting with Windows Vista, console {{commands}} and PowerShell applets perform limited {{pattern matching}} by allowing wildcards in filename and each subdirectory in the <b>file</b> <b>path</b> and silently substituting the first matching directory entry (for example, [...] {{will change the}} current directory to [...] ).|$|E
50|$|The ZeBu {{compiler}} does automation chip division, {{where one}} SoC {{is divided into}} multiple FPGAs based on user specified parameters for input <b>file</b> <b>paths,</b> such as EDIF Netlist, number of FPGAs the ZeBu board has, {{and the number of}} CPUs used for compilation.|$|R
40|$|This {{pamphlet}} by the South Carolina Department of Archives and History {{is one in}} {{a series}} titled Electronic Records Management Guidelines. This pamphlet addresses file naming, its uses and legal considerations including differences among <b>file</b> names, <b>file</b> <b>paths,</b> and addresses, challenges in file naming and Internet file naming protocols...|$|R
50|$|The {{location}} of the Media and the Render/Cache Files is not standardised. Final Cut Pro can be configured where to store them. Some users have a central directory where they store all their Source/Render/Cache files, some set those <b>file</b> <b>paths</b> to their specific project directory, so that they have all project files at one place.|$|R
5000|$|... that selects C {{elements}} that are children of B {{elements that}} are children of the A element that forms the outermost element of the XML document. The XPath syntax is designed to mimic URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) and Unix-style <b>file</b> <b>path</b> syntax.|$|E
5000|$|Adobe Reader {{has been}} {{incompatible}} with Application Data {{located on a}} UNC <b>file</b> <b>path</b> since at least version 9.0, which would crash with a runtime error. Adobe Reader X (10.0) is partially compatible but will not run in document protection mode on a UNC path.|$|E
5000|$|The format {{combines}} the pre-existing system of domain names (created in 1985) with <b>file</b> <b>path</b> syntax, where slashes {{are used to}} separate directory and filenames. Conventions already existed where server names could be prefixed to complete file paths, preceded by a double slash (...) [...]|$|E
5000|$|Program code {{should not}} contain [...] "hard-coded" [...] (literal) values {{referring}} to environmental parameters, such as absolute <b>file</b> <b>paths,</b> <b>file</b> names, user names, host names, IP addresses, URLs, UDP/TCP ports. Otherwise the application {{will not run}} on a host that has a different design than anticipated. A careful programmer can parametrize such variables and configure them for the hosting environment outside of the application proper (for example in property files, on an application server, or even in a database). Compare the mantra of a [...] "single point of definition"(SPOD).|$|R
50|$|A feature {{specific}} to the Soulseek search engine is {{the inclusion of the}} folder names and <b>file</b> <b>paths</b> in the search list. This allows users to search by folder name. For example, typing in experimental will return all the files that are contained in folders having that name, providing quick access to bands and albums in a determined musical genre.|$|R
50|$|The {{advanced}} MAPS membership {{choice in}} Windows Defender or Microsoft Security Essentials results in sending {{more information about}} software files, usage, and how it affects your computer. Computer information is sent (such as IP address, operating system, and Web browser), and personal information might be sent (such as search terms, data entered into forms, <b>file</b> <b>paths,</b> or partial memory dumps), but will {{not be used to}} identify you or contact you.|$|R
5000|$|The {{command prompt}} {{requires}} {{the use of}} drive letters to assign a working directory, which makes running complex batch files stored on a server UNC share more difficult. While a batch file can be run from a UNC <b>file</b> <b>path,</b> the working directory default is [...] "C:\Windows\system32\" ...|$|E
5000|$|Note: One can {{notice that}} the AWT Native Interface {{requires}} the [...] "jawt.dll" [...] (or [...] "jawt.so") to run with the application, so {{the easiest way to}} do that is copying the [...] "jawt.dll" [...] (should be in the .../jre/bin <b>file</b> <b>path</b> of the JDK's installation path.) ...|$|E
5000|$|They also collect {{detailed}} information on malware and exploits they find, tied to the user's license number and device identifier, [...] "vendor... <b>File</b> <b>path</b> of exploit process...

50|$|In Unix-like {{operating}} systems absolute and relative <b>file</b> <b>paths</b> differ from Windows, {{because there are}} no drive letters, Environment variables differ and / (forward slashes) are used as directory separators instead of \ (backslashes). Therefore playlists pointing to absolute <b>paths</b> or media <b>files</b> outside of the folder containing the playlist will only work for one type of operating system - either Windows or Unix-like. URLs work the same for all types.|$|R
25|$|Dynamic loading, {{a subset}} of dynamic linking, {{involves}} a dynamically linked library loading and unloading at run time on request. Such a request may be made implicitly at compile time or explicitly at run time. Implicit requests are made at compile time when a linker adds library references that include <b>file</b> <b>paths</b> or simply <b>file</b> names. Explicit requests are made when applications make direct calls to an operating system's API at run time.|$|R
50|$|From release V5.0 Tru64 UNIX {{offered a}} {{clustering}} facility named TruCluster Server. TruCluster utilised a cluster-wide filesystem visible to each cluster member, plus member specific storage and an optional quorum disk. Member specific <b>files</b> <b>paths</b> were enhanced symbolic links incorporating the member id of the owning member. Each member {{had one or}} zero votes, which, combined with a possible quorum disk, implemented a cluster formation algorithm similar to that found in OpenVMS.|$|R
