40|$|Suspended {{particulate}} matter {{is a primary}} variable with respect to biological and physical processes in the marine environment. The authors have developed an <b>integrated</b> <b>towed</b> instrument platform system to analyze as broad a spectrum of particulate sizes as possible using state-of-the-art technology to address basic oceanographic, environmental and military issues. The High Resolution Sampler (HRS) system uses several technologies to address different size classes of the marine particle spectrum. The 50 μ to 2 cm (spherical diameter, SD) size classes are quantified using Optical Plankton Counters (OPC, Focal Technologies, Inc.), employed alone or in tandem. The 50 μ and greater size classes are also quantified using a non-intrusive laser light sheet/video system {{as well as a}} collimated dual light sheet system under development. As an alternative to optical systems, the authors are developing a multiple frequency, miniaturized forward-looking “chirp” sonar for ensonifying a parcel of water directly ahead of the light sheet (see Remsen et al., this volume). All data are collected in situ and transferred to deck for real-time display and storage. Verification systems include a plankton cod-end (50 - 162 μ mesh) carousel (20 positions) net system for collecting particles which have passed through the optical sensors. The integrated optical-electronic sensor package is mounted on a towed vehicle which has been sea tested over several years in the Gulf of Mexico and Weddell Sea...|$|R
40|$|Hydrography and larval fish {{distribution}} in the northeastern North Sea were studied during a research programme carried out {{during the period from}} 1991 to 1994. The aim was to examine the connection between frontal zone formation and nursery characteristics of gadoid larvae at the shelf break. Emphasis was placed on the year-to-year variation in frontal characteristics and distributional patterns of larvae An area of about 67000 km 2 covering the northeastern North Sea, the Skagerrak and the Kattegat was surveyed by grid or transect sampling. At each sampling station the hydrography was studied by CTD casts, and the abundance of fish larvae was measured by depth <b>integrating</b> <b>tows</b> of a 2 m ring net. Five species of gadoid larvae and small luveniles were found in the area. cod Gadus rnorhua, whiting Merlangjus merlangus, haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus, Norway pout Trisopterus esmarki and saithe Pollachius virens. Larval abundance differed markedly between species and years. The abundance of all species was the highest in 1992 and declined during the follo~ving 2 years. In 1994, cod and whiting were the only gadoid species observed. Peak abundance of all gadoids was found {{in the vicinity of the}} frontal zone; however, the relationship between larval distribution and hydrography differed among species. Correspondence between spatial and interannual variation in characteristics of frontal zones and larval distributions suggests that frontal zone variability is a central element in the early hfe of gadoid larvae from the area...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a method to}} sample the highly contagious distribution of pelagic ®sh eggs. CUFES, the contin-uous, underway ®sh egg sampler, consists of a sub-mersible pump, concentrator, electronics and sample collector. This system operates continuously and under nearly all sea conditions, providing a real-time esti-mate of the volumetric abundance of pelagic ®sh eggs at pump depth, usually 3 m. CUFES-derived estimates of volumetric abundance agree well with those from nets towed at pump depth and with areal abundance estimated from vertically <b>integrated</b> plankton <b>tows.</b> CUFES has been used successfully to sample the eggs of menhaden, pin®sh, sardine, and anchovy off the coasts of the eastern and western United States and South Africa. Two large patches of eggs of the At-lantic menhaden were sampled off North Carolina in winter 1993 ± 94, had a linear scale of 5 ± 10 km, and were found in waters between the Gulf Stream and mid-shelf front.

40|$|This thesis {{researches}} several novel {{high power}} wideband antennas with omnidirectional, horizon- and broadside-directional, and bi-directional coverage for various electronic warfare (EW) systems. The developed antennas are designed and analyzed with the considerations in frequency domain (FD), time domain (TD), and power domain (PD) using full-wave electromagnetic simulations, transient analysis, multiphysics simulations, field analysis, equivalent circuit modeling, spherical mode decomposition, etc., as needed. The theoretical models of all antenna configuration are carefully validated with measurements. Equivalent circuit models of monopole-like antennas are derived {{based on the}} physical structure and field distribution around a monopole. These models are used to ease physical understanding, analyze antenna impedance, and design derivatives with improved performance. A novel wideband omnidirectional antenna with consistent monopole-like patterns is proposed for millimeter-wave <b>integrated</b> <b>towed</b> decoy receiving subsystems by combining annular slot mode with a monopole into a single structure. The bandwidth of the combined antenna is improved to cover {{the wide range of}} radar signals from 18 GHz to 45 GHz, and its operating principle is analyzed using the proposed equivalent circuit model. In addition, compact paraboloid reflector fed by the combined antenna is designed for the same platform but with enabled horizon-directional coverage. The path toward using the proposed combined antenna for transient high power electromagnetics (HPEM) applications with good TD and PD performances is described. Reconfigurability between steerable horizon-directional and omnidirectional modes for transient HPEM pulses is demonstrated by a monocone fed reflector antenna system. To do so, a conventional monocone is modified to a conical monopole first. The spherical mode expansion (SME) analysis shows that this structure has consistent monopole-like patterns and {{can be used as a}} feeder of a wideband reflector antenna system. Owing to the small diameter and consistent patterns of the modified monocone feeder, a paraboloid reflector is engineered and stable impedance and far-field performances from 1. 66 GHz to 20 GHz are demonstrated. Analysis in TD and PD proves the suitability of the proposed antenna concept for transient HPEM applications. The electrical size of the monocone is also reduced by loading shorted semi-helical wires. The circuit model analysis demonstrates that typical miniaturization techniques require large monocone diameter though height can be greatly reduced. The proposed loading does not contribute to additional antenna volume, while lowering its electrical size by 34 %, and the prototype monocone achieves good impedance match and gain from 1. 23 GHz to 11 GHz. Planar bi-directional and flush-mountable broadside unidirectional log-periodic (LP) antennas for long range communication, radar, or jammer systems with over a decade wideband performance are also introduced. To maintain inherent bi-directionality of a planar LP antenna, microstrip feed is preferred over a typical coax-based exciter. However, this leads to deteriorated impedance match and pattern distortion when the boom angle is not wide enough. To resolve this issue, a novel wide-boom geometry of the LP antenna is proposed. Since the wide-boom provides wide ground plane for the feeding microstrip line, good impedance match and gain performances can be achieved without sacrificing the antenna size. Moreover, electro-thermal multiphysics analysis of the antenna shows that the wide-boom also improves the temperature response, and thus, the average power handling capability is increased. The multiphysics simulation results are validated using a non-contact infrared (IR) camera. To achieve broadside unidirectional coverage, a slot-loaded cavity backing design is engineered. Instead of filling the cavity with carbon loaded absorber, the proposed slot-cavity backed LP antenna is loaded with the slot terminated by a coax cable that can be easily used for energy recycling. Fabricated prototype maintains high gain and efficiency with good impedance match over a wide bandwidth from 0. 59 GHz to 5 GHz. All ideas and concepts proposed in this thesis are thoroughly validated with circuit and full-wave simulations as well as experiments on representative prototypes...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Juvenile walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) {{are one of}} {{the primary}} prey items for bird and mammal predators in the Bering Sea and support a large {{commercial}} fishery. An understanding of the environmental factors that determine the horizontal and vertical distribution of juvenile pollock is needed to estimate the effects that environmental variation may have on pollock and their predators. During the summers of 2008 and 2009, surveys were conducted in three topographic zones (Middle Shelf, Outer Shelf, and Slope) near the Pribilof Islands in the southeastern Bering Sea. Environmental data collected for each transect included temperature, salinity, depth, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll a fluorescence. Additionally, each transect consisted of 10 km of multi-frequency acoustic sampling, a vertically <b>integrated</b> zooplankton net <b>tow,</b> and a targeted oblique fish tow. In 2008, juvenile pollock were found primarily in the Middle Shelf zone and were dominated by small young of the year individuals. In 2009, juvenile pollock were significantly less abundant, young of the year were larger, and vertical distributions were much deeper. In both years, juvenile pollock horizontal distribution was highly variable and not well explained by the physical environment. Temperature structure (thermocline depth, mean temperature at pollock depth, and mean temperature above the thermocline) explained 70 % of the variability in the vertical distribution of age- 0 pollock which also varied with time of day and topographic zone. These differences in horizontal and vertical distribution are likely to affect the use of habitat by predators and may have implications for future sampling...|$|R

In the US, the RTX trim {{was removed from the}} lineup and the RTS trim gained a power-adjustable lumbar, an MP3/auxiliary input jack, and a seven-pin trailer wiring harness. The US RTL trim gained the same seven-pin harness and received new 18 in alloy rims and a 115V/100W AC inverter; if equipped with navigation, the US RTL also received a rearview camera, Class 2 Bluetooth with Honda's HandsFreeLink system and a multi-data/multilingual information display. [...] For Canadians, a new lineup of trim levels were introduced that more closely resembled the US lineup. [...] A new V6 engine (the J35Z5) was introduced that produced up to [...] more torque at lower revolutions per minute (rpm) than its predecessor with a slight horsepower (hp) increase of [...] at the top of its rpm band. The transmission was also revised with the greatest differences found in third and fourth gears providing approximately 5% lower ratios. [...] Also for the 2009 model year, Honda swapped four of its exterior color options in the US and three in Canada for slightly different shades of the same base colors --leaving Canadians with two different black paints to choose from-- while adding a light brown color, called [...] "Mocha Metallic," [...] to the exterior color palette in the US and Canadian markets.|$|R
