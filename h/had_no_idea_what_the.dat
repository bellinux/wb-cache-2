500|$|For {{the filming}} of the chestburster scene, the cast members knew that the {{creature}} would be bursting out of Hurt, and had seen the chestburster puppet, but {{they had not been}} told that fake blood would also be bursting out in every direction from high-pressure pumps and squibs. The scene was shot in one take using an artificial torso filled with blood and viscera, with Hurt's head and arms coming up from underneath the table. The chestburster was shoved up through the torso by a puppeteer who held it on a stick. When the creature burst through the chest a stream of blood shot directly at Veronica Cartwright, shocking her enough that she fell over and went into hysterics. According to Tom Skerritt: [...] "What you saw on camera was the real response. She <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> hell happened. All of a sudden this thing just came up." [...] The creature then runs off-camera, an effect accomplished by cutting a slit in the table for the puppeteer's stick to go through and passing an air hose through the puppet's tail to make it whip about.|$|E
500|$|Pelé {{was born}} on 23 October 1940, in Três Corações, Minas Gerais, Brazil, the son of Fluminense footballer Dondinho (born João Ramos do Nascimento) and Celeste Arantes. He was the elder of two siblings. He was named after the American {{inventor}} Thomas Edison. His parents decided to remove the [...] "i" [...] and call him [...] "Edson", {{but there was a}} mistake on the birth certificate, leading many documents to show his name as [...] "Edison", not [...] "Edson", as he is called. He was originally nicknamed [...] "Dico" [...] by his family. He received the nickname [...] "Pelé" [...] during his school days, when it is claimed he was given it because of his pronunciation of the name of his favorite player, local Vasco da Gama goalkeeper Bilé, which he misspoke but the more he complained the more it stuck. In his autobiography, Pelé stated he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> name means, nor did his old friends. Apart from the assertion that the name is derived from that of Bilé, and that it is Hebrew for [...] "miracle" [...] (פֶּ֫לֶא), the word has no known meaning in Portuguese.|$|E
500|$|... "Boy-Scoutz 'n the Hood" [...] {{was written}} by Dan McGrath and {{directed}} by Jeffrey Lynch. The episode was recorded at the Village Recorder in West Los Angeles. Ernest Borgnine guest starred in the episode as himself. The staff liked {{his work on the}} films Marty and From Here to Eternity, so they asked him to do a guest appearance on the show. Borgnine felt he could not say no to the offer because his grandchildren were fans of the show. In the final scene of the episode, Borgnine plays a guitar and sings campfire songs with the children. Borgnine was a guitar player in real life, so he brought his own guitar with him to the recording studio. Borgnine apologized because he felt that he was not being able to sing very well, but Nancy Cartwright, who provides the voice of Bart, thought his voice [...] "added to the authenticity of his character". The Simpsonss creator Matt Groening thought the recording sessions with Borgnine were [...] "so much fun". Hank Azaria, who provides the voice of Apu, commented that Borgnine [...] "had no idea what the hell he was doing. He's a good actor, and he read his lines just fine, but he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> show was, no idea what we were doing." ...|$|E

500|$|The next concept, Dark Camelot, still {{focused on}} sword combat. Its plot—an {{inversion}} of Arthurian legend—featured Mordred as a misunderstood hero, King Arthur as a tyrannical villain and Merlin as a psychopath. According to Church, the game featured Morgan le Fay as Mordred's [...] "sort of good" [...] advisor and Guinevere as a lesbian who would betray Lancelot and help Mordred {{to break into}} Camelot and steal the Holy Grail. The game's design combined a first-person perspective with action, role-playing and adventure elements. Warren Spector, who had recently left Origin Systems to found Looking Glass Studios Austin, became Dark Camelots producer after his predecessor departed. Artist Dan Thron said: [...] "For a good long time, we <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> game was about, until somebody stumbled upon the whole thief game play where you're not just running out trying to chop people up." [...] Church recalled that [...] "the basic stealth model was [...] having the guard {{looking the other way}} and you going past pretty quickly. So Paul [...] had been pushing for a while that the thief side of it was the really interesting part and why not you just do a thief game." [...] A previously unreleased trailer for [...] Dark Camelot and its Stargate Engine was uploaded to YouTube in 2013.|$|E
500|$|According to Bruce, [...] "In Yo Face" [...] was {{originally}} titled [...] "Pie in Yo Face", {{but it was}} decided that the final title sounded better. [...] "The Bone" [...] features surf rock-influenced guitars. According to Bruce, [...] "Mike's beat for this was so fuckin' crazy sounding I <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> fuck to do with it." [...] "To Catch a Predator" [...] was written during the mixing process, when the group realized that the album needed a song [...] "that attacks an evil". Inspired by the television series To Catch a Predator, the song's lyrics describe Violent J luring pedophiles into his house to violently murder them. According to Bruce, [...] "I could easily see myself killing pedophiles in real life and having no guilt. The only reason I don’t do it is because I'd probably get caught. So its nice to live it out through my music." [...] "Boing Boing", a comedic sex-oriented rap, samples audio from a pornographic film which had previously been sampled by the group on their Tunnel of Love EP. Bruce says that the song was intended as a joke. Some fans interpreted the song as Bruce and Utsler calling themselves ugly, while others believed that they were bragging about how many women they have sex with. Bruce commented [...] "We're not sex symbols, especially not me. If there are girls, they’re there to see Shaggy." ...|$|E

2500|$|The first {{mass murder}} {{known to have}} been {{committed}} entirely by Battalion 101 was the most [...] "messy" [...] for lack of training; uniforms dripping wet with brain matter and blood. The killing of 1,500 Jews from Józefów ghetto, approximately 100 kilometers south of Lublin in southeastern Poland on 13 July 1942 was performed mostly by the three platoons of the Second Company. Prior to departure from Biłgoraj they were given large amounts of extra ammunition and therefore claiming to have <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> purpose of the mission was would have been a lie. A generous supply of alcohol was procured. Twelve out of 500 soldiers opted out when allowed to leave freely. Those of them who felt unable to continue shooting at point-blank range of prisoners begging for mercy, were asked to wait at the marketplace where the trucks were loaded. The action was finished in seventeen hours. The bodies of the dead carpeting the forest floor at the Winiarczykowa Góra hill (about 2km from the village, pictured) were left unburied. Watches, jewelry and money were taken. The battalion left for Biłgoraj at 9pm. Only a dozen Jews are known to have survived the slaughter. Two members of the Mart family from the German minority residing in Józefów were shot by Polish underground thereafter for cooperation with the enemy.|$|E

60|$|I {{was like}} a child in Wonderland all that night. The dawn found us both still at work--we kept our {{electric}} light going heedless of the day. I remember now exactly how these drawings looked. I shaded and tinted while Cavor drew--smudged and haste-marked they were in every line, but wonderfully correct. We got out the orders for the steel blinds and frames we needed from that night's work, and the glass sphere was designed within a week. We gave up our afternoon conversations and our old routine altogether. We worked, and we slept and ate when we could work no longer for hunger and fatigue. Our enthusiasm infected even our three men, though they <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> sphere was for.

60|$|We {{started out}} on our {{storming}} expedition on a Tuesday night, about nine o'clock; we had a latch-key, so we could come home when we pleased. Rectus carried the rope, and I had the grapnel, wrapped in its cotton wool. We put newspapers around these things, and made pretty respectable packages of them. We did not go down the sea-wall, but walked around {{through some of the}} inner streets. It seemed to us like a curious expedition. We were {{not going to do anything}} wrong, but we <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> United States government would think about it. We came down to the fort on its landward side, but our attack was to be made upon the waterfront, and so we went around that way, on the side farthest from the town. There were several people about yet, and we had to wait. We dropped our packages into the moat, and walked about on the water-battery, which is between the harbor and the moat, and is used as a sort of pleasure-ground by the people of the town. It was a pretty dark night, although the stars were out, and the last of the promenaders soon went home; and then, after giving them about ten minutes to get entirely out of sight and hearing, we jumped down into the moat, which is only five or six feet below the water-battery, and, taking our packages, went over to that part of the wall which we had fixed upon for our assault.|$|E
60|$|A {{quarter of}} an hour before dinner Lionel sent word to her room that she was to sit down without him--he had a {{headache}} and wouldn't appear. This was an unexpected grace and it simplified the position for Laura; so that, smoothing her ruffles, she betook herself to the table. Before doing this however {{she went back to the}} schoolroom and told Miss Steet she must contribute her company. She took the governess (the little boys were in bed) downstairs with her and made her sit opposite, thinking she would be a safeguard if Lionel were to change his mind. Miss Steet was more frightened than herself--she was a very shrinking bulwark. The dinner was dull and the conversation rare; the governess ate three olives and looked at the figures on the spoons. Laura had more than ever her sense of impending calamity; a draught of misfortune seemed to blow through the house; it chilled her feet under her chair. The letter she had in her head went out like a flame in the wind and her only thought now was to telegraph to Selina the first thing in the morning, in quite different words. She scarcely spoke to Miss Steet and there was very little the governess could say to her: she had already related her history so often. After dinner she carried her companion into the drawing-room, by the arm, and they sat down to the piano together. They played duets for an hour, mechanically, violently; Laura <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> music was--she only knew that their playing was execrable. In spite of this--'That's a very nice thing, that last,' she heard a vague voice say, behind her, at the end; and she became aware that her brother-in-law had joined them again.|$|E

6000|$|My {{beautiful}} new watch had run {{eighteen months}} without losing or gaining, and without breaking {{any part of}} its machinery or stopping. I {{had come to believe}} it infallible in its judgments about the time of day, and to consider its constitution and its anatomy imperishable. But at last, one night, I let it run down. I grieved about {{it as if it were}} a recognized messenger and forerunner of calamity. But by and by I cheered up, set the watch by guess, and commanded my bodings and superstitions to depart. Next day I stepped into the chief jeweler's to set it by the exact time, and the head of the establishment took it out of my hand and proceeded to set it for me. Then he said, [...] "She is four minutes slow-regulator wants pushing up." [...] I tried to stop him--tried to make him understand that the watch kept perfect time. But no; all this human cabbage could see was that the watch was four minutes slow, and the regulator must be pushed up a little; and so, while I danced around him in anguish, and implored him to let the watch alone, he calmly and cruelly did the shameful deed. My watch began to gain. It gained faster and faster day by day. Within the week it sickened to a raging fever, and its pulse went up to a hundred and fifty in the shade. At the end of two months it had left all the timepieces of the town far in the rear, and was a fraction over thirteen days ahead of the almanac. It was away into November enjoying the snow, while the October leaves were still turning. It hurried up house rent, bills payable, and such things, in such a ruinous way that I could not abide it. I took it to the watchmaker to be regulated. He asked me if I had ever had it repaired. I said no, it had never needed any repairing. He looked a look of vicious happiness and eagerly pried the watch open, and then put a small dice-box into his eye and peered into its machinery. He said it wanted cleaning and oiling, besides regulating--come in a week. After being cleaned and oiled, and regulated, my watch slowed down to that degree that it ticked like a tolling bell. I began to be left by trains, I failed all appointments, I got to missing my dinner; my watch strung out three days' grace to four and let me go to protest; I gradually drifted back into yesterday, then day before, then into last week, and by and by the comprehension came upon me that all solitary and alone I was lingering along in week before last, and the world was out of sight. I seemed to detect in myself a sort of sneaking fellow-feeling for the mummy in the museum, and a desire to swap news with him. I went to a watchmaker again. He took the watch all to pieces while I waited, and then said the barrel was [...] "swelled." [...] He said he could reduce it in three days. After this the watch averaged well, but nothing more. For half a day it would go like the very mischief, and keep up such a barking and wheezing and whooping and sneezing and snorting, that I could not hear myself think for the disturbance; and as long as it held out there was not a watch in the land that stood any chance against it. But the rest of the day it would keep on slowing down and fooling along until all the clocks it had left behind caught up again. So at last, at the end of twenty-four hours, it would trot up to the judges' stand all right and just in time. It would show a fair and square average, and no man could say it had done more or less than its duty. But a correct average is only a mild virtue in a watch, and I took this instrument to another watchmaker. He said the king-bolt was broken. I said I was glad it was nothing more serious. To tell the plain truth, I <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> king-bolt was, but I did not choose to appear ignorant to a stranger. He repaired the king-bolt, but what the watch gained in one way it lost in another. It would run awhile and then stop awhile, and then run awhile again, and so on, using its own discretion about the intervals. And every time it went off it kicked back like a musket. I padded my breast for a few days, but finally took the watch to another watchmaker. He picked it all to pieces, and turned the ruin over and over under his glass; and then he said there appeared to be something the matter with the hair-trigger. He fixed it, and gave it a fresh start. It did well now, except that always at ten minutes to ten the hands would shut together like a pair of scissors, and from that time forth they would travel together. The oldest man in the world could not make head or tail of the time of day by such a watch, and so I went again to have the thing repaired. This person said that the crystal had got bent, and that the mainspring was not straight. He also remarked that part of the works needed half-soling. He made these things all right, and then my timepiece performed unexceptionably, save that now and then, after working along quietly for nearly eight hours, everything inside would let go all of a sudden and begin to buzz like a bee, and the hands would straightway begin to spin round and round so fast that their individuality was lost completely, and they simply seemed a delicate spider's web over the face of the watch. She would reel off the next twenty-four hours in six or seven minutes, and then stop with a bang. I went with a heavy heart to one more watchmaker, and looked on while he took her to pieces. Then I prepared to cross-question him rigidly, for this thing was getting serious. The watch had cost two hundred dollars originally, and I seemed to have paid out two or three thousand for repairs. While I waited and looked on I presently recognized in this watchmaker an old acquaintance--a steamboat engineer of other days, and not a good engineer, either. He examined all the parts carefully, just as the other watchmakers had done, and then delivered his verdict with the same confidence of manner.|$|E
