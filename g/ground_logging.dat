50|$|This genus of damselflies {{are known}} as dancers because of the {{distinctive}} jerky form of flight they use which contrasts with the straightforward direct flight of bluets, forktails and other pond damselflies. They are usually {{to be seen in}} the open where they catch flying insects on the wing rather than flying about among vegetation picking off sedentary prey items. They tend to land and perch flat on the <b>ground,</b> <b>logs</b> and rocks. When perched, they usually hold their wing slightly raised above the abdomen.|$|R

40|$|An {{inexpensive}} optically isolated nanoammeter, which permits digital logging of dc currents from an electrospray colloid thruster {{operated in}} vacuum {{has been designed}} for using with micro-Newton electric propulsion technology. The two-stage optically isolated system is intended to safely measure and record a current generated at high voltage, facilitating data acquisition with a <b>grounded</b> <b>logging</b> device such as a personal computer. It operates by converting the current into a frequency in a battery-powered, floated, high-voltage stage. Agilent Technologies fiber-optic kits were selected for their low cost and reliability. The fiber-optic cable passes between the high voltage and the grounded receiver stage via grommeted holes drilled in the metal housing. The use this optically isolated system permits accurate monitoring of micro-Newton thruster currents directly rather than through inaccurate proxies, giving physical insight into {{the behavior of the}} system at high accuracy and low cost...|$|R

50|$|The {{desire of}} the Wilberforce colonists was for more than mere literacy. By 1832 the {{settlement}} had crops in the <b>ground</b> and <b>log</b> homes. Settlers built three sawmills, one powered by water; a gristmill, and several general stores. The proximity of the settlement to the Ausable River gave transportation access to goods, and provided a way to export products, both agricultural and forest-related.|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{ecology and}} {{structural}} habitat use of two closely related sympatric lizards, Carlia vivax (de Vis) and Lygisaurus foliorum de Vis, {{were examined in}} an open sclerophyll forest in subtropical Australia. Comparable mean body temperatures (T-b) and habitat temperatures (T-hab) {{at the point of}} capture were recorded for both species. However, sex- related differences in the thermal variables for C. vivax, with females displaying higher temperatures than males, resulted in some significant differences in T-b and T-hab between the species. Variation in T-b and T-hab within and between species was unrelated to time of capture. The difference in T-hab within C. vivax suggested that females were selecting warmer thermal environments than males. Both C. vivax and L. foliorum used most structural features of their habitat randomly as indicated by a similarity in canopy, shrub, <b>ground,</b> <b>log</b> and litter cover and litter depth between habitat surveys and random surveys. However, C. vivax displayed a preference for ground vegetation (heigh...|$|R

The fire had helped to clear the ground, but wet men were at work with axes and saws.|$|R
50|$|Throughout the cemetery, the {{topography}} provides the social {{division of the}} cemetery with private graves occupying the highest ground in each portion, public graves along the lower sections and paupers and criminals occupying the low-lying, water <b>logged</b> <b>ground</b> along the creek. The contrast is stark between elaborate monuments built by the elite on the highest ground {{in an attempt to}} cheat death through immortality, when compared to the unmarked graves of anonymous paupers on low lying water <b>logged</b> <b>ground.</b> With two exceptions, the Presbyterians in Portion 24 and the Primitive Methodists mostly in Portion 6, the creek serves to separate the general ground to the south from the ground occupied by religious denominations to the north.|$|R
40|$|Rufous treecreepers (Climacteris rufa) {{are common}} in {{southern}} jarrah forests of Western Australia, but nothing has been recorded of their ecology in the region. I investigated the foraging and nesting ecology of the species in the southern jarrah forests from January 1994 to April 1996. Rufous treecreepers foraged exclusively on two eucalypt species, jarrah and marri, and foraged on trees that were significantly larger and taller than random. Foraging on the <b>ground,</b> <b>logs</b> and fallen trees was relatively infrequent. Nest hollows were also located exclusively in jarrah and marri trees that were significantly larger and taller than random. The important foraging and nesting resources for the species in the southern jarrah forest appear to be large mature and overmature eucalypts. Anthropogenic impacts in the region, primarily logging, should aim to retain these resources in affected areas to improve the survival prospects of the species. When compared with studies in wandoo woodlands, {{the results of the}} present study indicate that the conservation of ground-layer habitat is likely to be of less importance in the jarrah forest. These habitat differences indicate that site-specific information is critical if the management and conservation of individual species is to be effective...|$|R
50|$|This is a low-set, single-storeyed, timber-framed {{structure}} with hardwood slab walls and floors and a hipped roof of unlined corrugated iron. Adzed timber rafters and tie beams with few battens support this roof, and the galvanised iron guttering is of early half-round profile. The principal uprights are morticed and tenoned to {{a bottom plate}} and carry a top plate, and the whole rests on timber stumps. Split hardwood slabs, both vertical and horizontal, provide the infill between the frames. There are no internal doorways. Slab partitions to ceiling height divide the structure into three rooms, each of which opens onto a verandah which runs {{the length of the}} building on the southwest side. The outer edge of the verandah floor is carried by a <b>ground</b> <b>log.</b> The former kitchen features a cooking alcove and chimney of corrugated iron attached to the end wall. This alcove is clad externally with vertical slabs and has a stone floor. Beyond the kitchen a small iron-roofed lean-to supported by timber posts is attached {{to the rear of the}} fireplace. The building remains substantially intact and has been furnished as a private museum, illustrating a typical bedroom and kitchen of the pioneer era.|$|R

40|$|The early {{colonization}} of newly created coarse woody material (CWM) by beetles was studied in aspen mixedwood forests at two locations in north-central Alberta. Healthy trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) trees, in old (3 ̆e 100 years) and mature (40 – 80 years) stands, were cut to provide {{three types of}} CWM: stumps, bolts on the <b>ground</b> (<b>logs),</b> and bolts suspended above the ground to simulate snags. Over 2 years, 1049 Coleoptera, represent- ing 49 taxa, were collected. Faunal structure differed little between the two locations. Species diversity was higher in old than in mature stands, and higher in stumps and logs than in suspended bolts; however, these “snags” tended to have higher abundance when compared with stumps and logs. Overall beetle abundance and the catch of wood-boring beetles was significantly higher {{in the first year}} post-treatment, mainly because of the ambrosia beetle (Trypodendron retusum (LeConte)) and one of its predators, Rhizophagus remotus LeConte; however, beetle diversity was higher in the second year, suggesting that early wood-boring species may “precondition” the wood for a number of succeeding spe- cies. The high turnover rate of taxa and spatial or temporal variation in faunal structure suggests that effort focused on habitat classification of CWM will facilitate management to conserve saproxylic faunal diversity...|$|R

50|$|The {{reserve is}} {{important}} in demonstrating the principal characteristics of rafting <b>grounds</b> where <b>logs</b> were assembled and floated to the ocean. It is located close to the highest navigable portion of the river: from here, logs could have unimpeded passage to the sea. Access to the water is easy because the banks are low, {{there is a wide}} expanse of relatively flat ground adjacent to the river where logs could be handled and temporarily stored, and the river could be forded so that both banks could be used.|$|R
40|$|The {{difference}} in species diversity on different substrates {{and the effect}} of both substrate (<b>ground,</b> <b>logs,</b> rocks, trees and fallen branches) and site variation (such as disturbance history, aspect, slope) on bryophyte and lichen diversity were investigated in eastern Australian forests. Thirty-five sites in forest types ranging from dry sclerophyll to riparian were surveyed using a 50 m x 20 m area. Despite strong differences between the different substrates in species richness and composition for both bryophytes and lichens, differences within each substrate were limited. On examining each substrate separately, we found that variation in substrate quality, such as degree of log decay, was not strongly correlated with species diversity, explaining no more than 16 % of richness and 5 % of composition. Despite both bryophytes and lichens showing high fidelity for particular substrates, the quality of that substrate was not an important factor in determining species diversity in this study. Site environmental variables explained larger variation in both bryophyte and lichen species diversity, in particular species richness, with individual site variables explaining up to 41 % of richness (topographic position) and 6 % of composition (time since fire). For some site variables, notably some of the disturbance variables, there were no overall trends, but significant results for particular substrates, such as logging being significant only on logs and trees...|$|R
