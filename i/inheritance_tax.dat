He exceeded his goal of having a 7.4percent minority representation in the state workforce, and appointed three times more African-Americans than the previous administration had recruited. He also appointed more women to government positions than his predecessor, including Sara Combs, the first woman to serve on the Kentucky Supreme Court.|$|E
40|$|The {{failure of}} the Henry Tax Review to fuel public debate around <b>inheritance</b> <b>taxes</b> in Australia leads some {{commentators}} to suggest that <b>inheritance</b> <b>taxes</b> are taboo in Australia. This article uses Beckert's historical analysis of inheritance law in the United States, Germany and France to assess this claim from a comparative perspective. It argues that the discursive field around <b>inheritance</b> <b>taxes</b> in Australia aligns most closely with that in the United States, but that there are substantial differences nonetheless. Whereas in the United States <b>inheritance</b> <b>taxes</b> are a touchstone for competing visions of liberal society, in Australia liberal ideals are heavily moderated by diverse pragmatic considerations. The upshot is {{a long tradition of}} bipartisanship and relative indifference around <b>inheritance</b> <b>taxes,</b> making it difficult to promote public debate as proposed by the Henry Review. At the same time, the fiscal challenges identified by the Henry Review-arising especially from the ageing of the population-means that we should not exaggerate the obstacles to their reinstatement...|$|R

5|$|Eight {{years before}} her death, she had {{reportedly}} placed two-thirds of her money into trusts, {{for the benefit}} of her great-grandchildren. She left the bulk of her estate, estimated to be worth £70million, including paintings, Fabergé eggs, jewellery, and horses, to her surviving daughter, Queen Elizabeth II. As property passing from monarch to monarch is exempt from <b>Inheritance</b> <b>Tax,</b> as is property passing from the consort of a former monarch to the current monarch, a tax liability estimated at £28million (40 percent {{of the value of the}} estate) was not incurred. The most important pieces of art were transferred to the Royal Collection by Elizabeth II.|$|E
5|$|To the poorest, Nerva granted allotments of land worth up to 60 million sesterces. He {{exempted}} {{parents and}} their children from a 5% <b>inheritance</b> <b>tax,</b> and he made loans to Italian landowners on the condition that they pay interest of 5% to their municipality to support the children of needy families; alimentary schemes which were later expanded by Trajan, Antoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius. Furthermore, numerous taxes were remitted and privileges granted to Roman provinces. Namely, he abolished abuses of the Fiscus Iudaicus, the additional tax which all Jews throughout the Empire had to pay: some of his coins bear the legend FISCI IUDAICI CALUMNIA SUBLATA (abolition of malicious prosecution regarding the Jewish tax).|$|E
5|$|John Preston Hippisley {{inherited}} {{the house in}} 1956 {{on the death of}} his father Richard John Bayntun Hippisley and in order to settle the liability for <b>inheritance</b> <b>tax</b> he sold Ston Easton. Subsequently maintenance of the building was poor and the fabric decayed. In 1958 a Preservation Order was obtained to stop the building being demolished and adding to the growing trend of destruction of country houses in 20th-century Britain. Restoration was undertaken by William Rees-Mogg who bought the building in 1964. Peter Smedley bought it from Rees-Mogg in 1977 or 1978 and carried out further restoration and converted it into a hotel. Notoriously he allowed the BBC to film his Dignitas assisted suicide. The house was sold again in 2001 to Von Essen Hotels.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of owner Charles van Raalte in 1907, his wife Florence stayed on Brownsea until 1925. Mary Bonham-Christie bought the island at an auction in 1927. In 1932, Bonham-Christie allowed 500 Scouts to camp there to {{celebrate}} the Silver Jubilee of Scouting, but shortly afterwards she closed the island {{to the public and}} it became very overgrown. In 1934, some Sea Scouts were camping on the island when a fire broke out. Mrs. Bonham-Christie blamed the Sea Scouts, although the fire did not start where the Sea Scouts were camping. The fire engulfed most of the island, burning west to east. The eastern buildings were only saved by a subsequent change in wind direction. Although it was not known how the fire started, Scouts were not allowed to camp on the island again until after Bonham-Christie's death in 1961. Her family becoming liable for <b>inheritance</b> <b>tax</b> on her estate, they put the island up for sale. Interested citizens who feared that the island would be bought by developers helped raise an endowment, and in 1962 the government allowed the National Trust to take over management of the island in lieu of the death duties.|$|E
5|$|In July 803, an Abbasid army under al-Qasim, {{a son of}} the Caliph Harun al-Rashid (r. 786–809), began {{advancing}} {{towards the}} Byzantine frontier. As Nikephoros had broken his foot in early May, it fell to Bardanes to lead the Byzantine army against the Arabs. He therefore ordered the thematic armies of Anatolia assembled in the Anatolic Theme. In mid-July 803 (the date is variously interpreted by modern scholars as 16, 18 or 19 July), Bardanes was proclaimed emperor by the assembled troops of the Anatolic, Opsician, Thracesian and Bucellarian themes. Crucially, the Armeniac Theme, either because of its traditional rivalry with the Anatolics, or because it had not yet joined up {{with the rest of}} the army, did not join the uprising. It has also been hypothesized that Bardanes may have participated in the suppression of the Armeniacs' revolt in 793, leaving a memory of hostility towards him amongst its troops. Among the Byzantine chronicles that report on Bardanes's revolt, the 10th-century Theophanes Continuatus and the 13th-century Synopsis Chronike indicate that the troops were motivated chiefly by economic concerns. Nikephoros had initiated a strict budgetary policy to shore up the Empire's finances. The Emperor had revoked the exemption on <b>inheritance</b> <b>tax</b> for the soldiers, and had apparently left them unpaid for some time as well. Bardanes, on the other hand, had a good reputation in this regard, fairly dividing the booty won from the campaigns against the Arabs amongst the soldiers.|$|E
