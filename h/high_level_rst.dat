40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithm to construct such multiparagraph {{structures in the}} context of a critique by the MACH-HI system of a student's performance in troubleshooting the HAWK radar. This critique is based on the functional hierarchy tree (FH tree), which is the heart of the expert system component of MACH-III [Kurland et aI 1989]. First we describe functional hierarchy as a paradigm for organizing expert system knowledge. Then the algorithm for generating text structures based on this functional hierarchy organization is presented in two parts. The first describes how the <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> <b>RST</b> structure defining the overall organization of the paragraphs and their contents is built. This is an elaboration of the algorithm first presented in [Granville 1993]. The second part describes how the individual paragraph RST structures are filled out, resulting in a complete representation of the desired text. This algorithm was developed as part of the George system, ongoing work extending MACH-III to improve explanation capabilities. The first part of the algorithm, that which builds the high-level RST structures, has been implemented. The second part is the current subject of the George effor...|$|R
40|$|Interferon-α (IFNα) {{has shown}} promise in the {{treatment}} of various cancers. However, the development of IFN resistance is a significant drawback. Using conditions that mimic in vivo selection of IFN-resistant cells, the RST 2 IFN-resistant cell line was isolated from the highly IFN-sensitive Daudi human Burkitt lymphoma cell line. The RST 2 cell line was resistant to the antiviral, antiproliferative, and gene-induction actions of IFNα. Although STAT 2 mRNA was present, STAT 2 protein expression was deficient in RST 2 cells. A variant STAT 2 mRNA, which resulted from alternative splicing within the intron between exon 19 and 20, was expressed in several human cell lines but at relatively <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> in <b>RST</b> 2 cells. Most importantly, the RST 2 line showed an intrinsic resistance to apoptosis induced by a number of chemotherapeutic agents (camptothecin, staurosporine, and doxorubicin). Expression of STAT 2 in RST 2 cells not only rescued their sensitivity to the biological activities of IFNs but also restored sensitivity to apoptosis induced by these chemotherapeutic agents. The intrinsic resistance of the RST 2 cells to IFN as well as chemotherapeutic agents adds a new dimension to our knowledge of the role of STAT 2 as it relates to not only biological actions of IFN but also resistance to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis...|$|R
40|$|C 1 - Journal Articles RefereedEight {{microsatellite}} markers {{were applied}} to 154 Sclerotinia sclerotiorum isolates from four Australian canola fields, {{to determine the extent}} of genetic variation and differentiation in populations of this pathogen. A total of 82 different haplotypes were identified and in each population many haplotypes were unique. Mycelial compatibility grouping, a phenotypic marker system controlled by multiple loci, was often associated with groups of identical or closely related microsatellite haplotypes. Genotypic diversity ranged from 36 % to 80 % of maximum in the four populations, and gene diversity ranged from 0. 23 to 0. 79. Genotypic disequilibrium analyses on each of the four populations suggested that both clonal and sexual reproduction contributed to population structure. Analyses based on genetic diversity and fixation indices demonstrated a moderate to <b>high</b> <b>level</b> of differentiation (<b>R(ST)</b> = 0. 16 - 0. 33, F(ST) = 0. 18 - 0. 23) between populations from New South Wales and those from Victoria.

40|$|This thesis {{explored}} {{underpinnings of}} the <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> motivational orientations, generic to {{various types of}} human choice, such as pro-social, intrinsic, achievement motivation and free-riding. Two different choice situations were examined: a choice of degree was utilized {{as a model of}} a real life choice and an experimental economic game (e. g. a public goods game) was used to study choices in a controlled laboratory environment. Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST, Gray & McNaughton, 2000) was employed as a theoretical framework of biological motivational traits to examine their links to <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> motivational orientations. <b>RST</b> proposes that individual differences in a vast range of behaviours are linked to individual propensities to approach or avoid in rewarding or punishing contexts. Thus, an individual differences framework was applied to study underpinnings of <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> motivational orientations through their links to the basic motivational traits of behavioural approach and inhibition. The results demonstrated that similar motivations (e. g. pro-social or strategic achievement tendencies) affected individual choices in both situations. In addition, these motivations were linked in a coherent fashion to the biological motivational traits of approach and avoidance. Specifically, individual differences in both intrinsic and strategic achievement motivation were associated with the trait behavioural approach. Pro-social and free-riding motivations were linked to the behavioural inhibition. Furthermore, individual choices in two different situations were mutually consistent. This research agenda reinforces the notion that individual choices on different levels (with a long-term influence, e. g. a choice of degree, or with a short-term influence, e. g. making a charitable donation) in part depend on dispositional traits (e. g. behavioural approach and inhibition). Incorporating the knowledge of basic motivational and affective decision-making mechanisms into the models of individual differences in motivation could considerably improve predictions about individual choices in real life. The findings contribute to the understanding of basic mechanisms underlying individual motivation. Links are established herein of the basic motivational traits to the <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> motivational orientations. These can serve as a starting point to develop further hypotheses about the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> motivational orientations and individual choices in real life.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between language brokering and its effects on the level of stress of the brokers. Specifically, the relationships between language brokering, parentification, stress, and gender were explored. Gender differences in the strength of this relationship were also examined. The following was expected: <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of brokering would correlate positively with <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of parentification; <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of brokering would correlate positively with <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of stress; <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of parentification would correlate with <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of stress; and that both brokering and parentification were gender specific, with female subjects reporting <b>higher</b> <b>levels.</b> The participants were 90 Latino undergrad students attending universities in the New York City area. The students completed several self-report measures including a parentification questionnaire, a language-brokering questionnaire, and stress scales. ^ Results showed that <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of language brokering were positively correlated with <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of parentification. Although no gender differences were found for levels of language brokering, females reported <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of parentification. Those who reported <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of brokering did not report <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of stress. However, those who reported <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of parentification reported <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of stress. The {{results of the present study}} emphasized the need for understanding the ramifications and long-term consequences of language brokering, particularly for the Latino community. While brokering itself may not lead to a heightened degree of stress, cultural nuances within the Latino community serve to further perpetuate the pressures associated with brokering. As such, once a pattern of brokering has been established and identified, interventions must be developed to decrease the occurrence of long term impairment of individual and family functioning. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to {{identify}} perceptions of built and social residential characteristics and their association with behaviors such as physical activity (PA), nutrition and smoking and with cardiovascular risk factors (elevated BMI and fasting blood glucose). Among participants of a preventive medical checkup at an Austrian District Health Insurance Fund (n= 904, response rate = 82. 2 %, 42 % women, 18 - 91 years) self-reported and measured data were collected. Total PA was positively associated with the presence of trees along the streets and <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of pro-physical activity social modeling (SM) and it was negatively related to perceived safety from crime. More leisure-time PA was associated with <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of cycling/walking infrastructure and <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of SM.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{addressed}} {{the relationships among}} professional efficacy, emotional exhaustion, and job characteristics (job demands and job control) {{in the context of}} a two-wave panel study among 828 Dutch police officers. Based on the demand-control model, we expected that high demands/high control would be positively related to professional efficacy, and that high demands/low control would be related to <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of exhaustion. Moreover, we hypothesized that <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of exhaustion would lead to lower levels of professional efficacy and that <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of efficacy would lead to low levels of exhaustion. Structural equation modelling largely supported these predictions. High demands were longitudinally related to <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of efficacy and <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of exhaustion; <b>high</b> control was longitudinally related to <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of efficacy. Further, efficacy and exhaustion were indeed mutually related. Finally, <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of exhaustion were longitudinally related to <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of demands. We conclude that there are complex, yet theoretically, and practically interpretable relations among efficacy, strain and work characteristics. © 2010 The British Psychological Society...|$|R
