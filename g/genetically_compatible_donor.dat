40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "More than 30, 000 people are diagnosed annually with leukemia or other blood, metabolic, or immune system disorders, many of whom may die without stem cell transplants, using stem cells from bone marrow or another source. When a patient needs a transplant of donated stem cells and no <b>genetically</b> <b>compatible</b> related <b>donor</b> is available, the National Bone Marrow Donor Registry may help the patient search for compatible stem cells from unrelated donors. The National Bone Marrow Registry Reauthorization Act of 1998 required, among other things, that the Registry carry out a donor recruitment program giving priority to minority and underrepresented donor populations, ensure efficiency of operations, and verify compliance with standards by organizations that participate in the Registry. From 1998, when the National Bone Marrow Registry Reauthorization Act was enacted, through 2001, the number of stem cell donors on the Registry increased for all racial and ethnic groups. Although {{the exact number of}} patients in need of transplants is not known, estimates suggest that about one-third of them use the Registry to search for donors. The organizations that are involved in transplantation and participate in the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) network generally adhere to NMDP's standards and procedures. In 2001, NMDP required 24 centers to take corrective actions because they did not meet its standards. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{increasing}} number of studies test the idea that females increase offspring fitness by biasing fertilization in favour of <b>genetically</b> <b>compatible</b> partners; however, few have investigated or controlled for corresponding preferences in males. Here, we experimentally test whether male red junglefowl, Gallus gallus, prefer <b>genetically</b> <b>compatible</b> females, measured by similarity at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), a key gene complex in vertebrate immune function. Theory predicts that because some degree of MHC heterozygosity favours viability, individuals should prefer partners that carry MHC alleles different from their own. While male fowl showed no preference when simultaneously presented with an MHC-similar and an MHC-dissimilar female, they showed a ‘cryptic’ preference, by allocating more sperm to the most MHC-dissimilar of two sequentially presented females. These results provide the first experimental evidence that males might respond to the MHC similarity of a female through differential ejaculate expenditure. By revealing that cryptic male behaviours may bias fertilization success in favour of <b>genetically</b> <b>compatible</b> partners, this study demonstrates the need to experimentally disentangle male and female effects when studying preferences for <b>genetically</b> <b>compatible</b> partners...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates a {{pairwise}} kidney {{exchange program}} that includes patient-donor pairs {{in which the}} patients can receive a kidney across the blood group barrier from their own donors. Patients in such pairs gain strictly by an exchange if they are matched to a fully <b>compatible</b> <b>donor.</b> We study the set of priority matchings where {{the number of patients}} matched to fully <b>compatible</b> <b>donors</b> is maximized among all priority matchings and where all matched patients that can receive a kidney across the blood group barrier from their own donors are matched to fully <b>compatible</b> <b>donors.</b> The main result demonstrates that matchings in this set can be identified by solving an appropriately defined maximum weight matching problem. It is also demonstrated that the inclusion of patients that can receive a kidney across the blood group barrier from their own donors will not reduce the number of transplants for patients with incompatible donors, as all patients involved in an exchange before the inclusion are still involved in an exchange after the inclusion...|$|R

40|$|Background: Sickle cell {{disease is}} a very common hemoglobinopathy. The main goal of {{transfusion}} therapy in sickle cell disease is to prevent thrombotic events, improve tissue oxygenation and treat anaemia complications. However the risk of all immunization is well known. Since 2001 our service has been doing a tight surveillance work in sickle cell patients, creating a database of about 15, 000 studied blood donors. Aims: We want to share our experience in transfusion of sickle cell patients and highlight the importance to have a computer database with <b>compatible</b> <b>donors</b> {{in order to reduce}} all immunization in these patients. Methods: We have studied the above described donors for the following blood group systems ABO, Rh, Kell, Duffy, Kidd, MNSs, Lutheran, P (P 1) and haemoglobin S. For each transfusion demand for these patients we research in our computer data base the more likely <b>compatible</b> <b>donor.</b> From January 2007 to January 2011 we studied 64 patients. To transfuse these patients we followed the protocol described above. We transfused these patients with red cells of <b>compatible</b> <b>donors</b> pre investigated. We perform pre transfusion tests in all patients. Results : Have been studied 64 patients who needed red cells transfusion, 30 were females and 34 were males. The range of ages was from 1 to 46 years old. 55 patients were black (85. 9 %). We have been able to transfuse these patients with red cells of 135 <b>compatible</b> <b>donors</b> from database. We performed 439 red cell concentrate (RCC) transfusions (average per patient 6. 85). The patient with the biggest supply was transfused with 22 RCC and we didn’t find in this case any clinically significant red cell alloantibody. We had 7 positive antibody screenings, 2 were anti-Lea, 2 anti-E and 3 were inconclusive. Summary/Conclusions: In our study all patients with clinically significant alloantibody were previously transfused in other institution. We didn’t find any alloantibody in patients exclusively transfused in our department. Our experience transfusing sickle cell disease patients reveals that RCC compatible to antigens of the groups mentioned above greatly reduce all immunization. Hence the importance of the existence in urgency blood department of extended phenotype donors files...|$|R

40|$|Renal {{function}} was studied in twenty-nine of thirty-four surviving renal allograft recipients from an initial group of sixty-four patients {{two years after}} transplantation. Mean clearances of inulin and PAH were, respectively, greater than and equal to half the donors' initial predicted clearances.

Patients with compatible donor-recipient lymphocyte antigens demonstrated statistically better function than those {{with one or more}} incompatibilities, although there was a definite degree of overlap between the two groups. In contrast, little correlation could be demonstrated between the cumulative histopathology and renal clearances.
