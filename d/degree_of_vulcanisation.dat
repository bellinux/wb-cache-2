40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{activity}} of several alkylpyrrolidinium, alkylpyridinium, alkylpiperidinium and benzylimidazolium ionic liquids (ILs) {{for the purpose of}} improving the dispersion <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>vulcanisation</b> activator and filler nanoparticles in the acrylonitrile-butadiene elastomer (NBR). The effect of the ionic liquids on the vulcanisation kinetics of the rubber compounds, crosslink density and mechanical properties of the vulcanisates and their resistance to thermo-oxidative and UV ageing was studied. The use of ionic liquids allowed for a homogeneous dispersion of nanoparticles in the elastomer without detrimental effects on the vulcanisation process. The physical properties and the thermal stability of the obtained vulcanisates were significantly improved. Ionic liquids increased the crosslink density of the vulcanisates and their damping properties. Pirydinium and piperidinium hexafluorophosphates were most effective at increasing the crosslink density and improving the properties of NBR composites...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} <b>of</b> new <b>vulcanisation</b> accelerators, {{based on}} 'safe-amines' has been technological realised. These accelerators {{do not produce}} carcinogenic N-Nitrosamines during the curing process and subsequent processing and storage. The concept of harmless substitutes for commonly used compounds, is a primary preventive measure which avoids the formation of carcinogenic substances at the outset. Thirty compounds of 150 newly synthesised accelerators showed very similar vulcanisation characteristics to those of industrial standard already in use. From these, three substances which are suitable for technical production were chosen (one in each important class of accelerators). The technical procedure for production {{on a large scale}} has been elucidated. Samples <b>of</b> these new <b>vulcanisation</b> accelerators were supplied to 20 interested companies in the rubber and tyre industry for testing.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{initiated}} {{in an attempt}} to investigate dithiocarbamic acid accelerated sulfur vulcanisation. This was, however, found impossible due to the innate instability of dithiocarbamic acids. The focus of the study was then shifted toward thiuram disulfide accelerated sulfur vulcanisation, with emphasis being placed on a rate comparison. Three groups of accelerators were investigated, namely the aromatic, linear aliphatic and cyclic aliphatic thiuram disulfide adducts. The analysis methods that were employed were conventional rubber (cis- 1, 4 -polyisoprene) techniques coupled to model (squalene) compound investigations. The data that was collected consisted of rheometrical torque vs. time data in the rubber system while the data obtained in the model compound study consisted of sulfur and accelerator concentration data as determined by means of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The aromatic accelerators were synthesised in our labs by means of an addition reaction between the aromatic amine and CS 2 in basic medium and subsequent oxidation with K 3 Fe(CN) 6, all in a 1 : 1 molar ratio. The reaction yield was low due to the instability of the dithiocarbamate intermediates and a sluggish oxidation reaction. In the rate constant determination a first order mathematical approach was used for the rubber system as crosslinking is considered to roughly obey first order kinetics. The model compound data was also found to more accurately fit the first order rate law, with an initial slopes method also being applied to the system to determine secondary rate constants and relative rates for the system. The determination <b>of</b> <b>vulcanisation</b> rate constants in the cis- 1, 4 -polyisoprene system was a success, while the rate data determined by means of the squalene model was more related to the rate of accelerator and sulfur consumption as opposed to the rate of crosslinking {{as is the case with}} the rubber rate data. The sulfur first order rate data mirrored the rate data derived from the rubber system more closely than the corresponding accelerator rate data, the relative rate data determined by means of initial slopes method, proved that the homolytic cleavage of thiuram disulfides and the subsequent formation of accelerator polysulfides were not limiting steps. This is seen in the similar relative rate data derived from both the raw sulfur and accelerator data in systems that exhibit vastly different vulcanisation rates. Squalene was deemed a suitable model for the cis- 1, 4 -polyisoprene system, although one should consider the extent of charring and solution effects in the individual systems to account for possible incongruities that may be observed between the rubber and simulated system. The lack of agreement between the rubber and model compound rate constant data lies in the fact that the rate of crosslinking is not simplistically related to the rate at which accelerator and sulfur is consumed, this being especially true for the rate at which the accelerator is consumed. Thus the discussion over the acceleratory rates in the various accelerator systems was limited to observations made in the rubber system, with the model compound data was used exclusively to elucidate mechanistic processes. It was discovered that the groups of accelerators examined, namely linear, cyclic and aromatic thiuram disulfide adducts, produced vastly varied rate data. The aromatic thiuram disulfide adducts had only a slight acceleratory effect on the rate <b>of</b> <b>vulcanisation</b> as compared to the unaccelerated sulfur system. The morpholine adduct had a moderately larger rate of acceleration followed by tetramethyl and tetrethylthiuram disulfide, with N‚ÄôN-dicyclopentamethylenethiuram disulfide having the fastest rate of acceleratio...|$|R
