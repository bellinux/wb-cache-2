Large scientific programs may employ multiple processes or threads {{to run on}} HPC systems for days. Reliability is an essential requirement of existing con-current programs. Therefore, verification of concurrent programs becomes increasingly important. Today we have two significant challenges in developing concurrent program verification tools: The first is scalability. Since new types of concurrent programs keep being created, verification tools need to scale to handle all these new types of programs. The second is providing <b>formal</b> <b>coverage</b> guarantee. Dynamic verification tools always face a huge schedule space. Both these capabilities must exist for testing programs that follow multiple concurrency models.

40|$|Dehydrogenation of {{isobutane}} in {{the presence}} of oxygen-industrially prospective process for isobutene production-has been studied over vanadium-antimony oxide catalysts. Their catalytic behaviour was compared with the sample characterisation data by specific surface area (SSA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Substantial improvement of the catalytic performance has been achieved as a result of proper spreading of active V-containing component onto an appropriate support. Optimisation of the composition and loading of the active component, the chemical nature and morphology of support material, as well as the preparation procedure allowed to further improve the yield of isobutene. Microspheric gamma-alumina with moderate SSA and large average pore diameter was found to be the best support for the efficient catalyst. The loading of vanadia corresponding to 1 - 1. 5 <b>formal</b> monolayer <b>coverage</b> and doping with antimony (V-to-Sb atomic ratio 8. 8) were found to be optimal. The use of "citrate" preparation technique showed an advantage in comparison with ordinary impregnation method, giving the catalyst with well dispersed (amorphous) and homogeneously distributed supported V-Sb-O-component. The optimised catalyst demonstrated improved stability, high activity and olefin selectivity (70 % at 36 % conversion), producing yields of isobutene (up to 26 % per pass) among the best reported in the literature.

40|$|The author {{examines}} public economics {{rationales for}} public intervention in health insurance markets, {{draws on the}} literature of organizational design to examine alternative intervention strategies, and considers health insurance reforms in four Latin American countries [...] Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Colombia [...] {{in light of the}} theoretical literature. Equity has been the main reason for large-scale public intervention in the health insurance sector, despite the well-known failures of insurance and health care markets associated with imperfect information. Recent reforms have sought less to make private markets more efficient than to make public provision more efficient, sometimes by altering the focus and function of existing institutions (such as the obras sociales in Argentina) or by encouraging the growth of new ones (such as Chile's ISAPREs). Generally, these four Latin American countries have reformed the ways insurance and care are organized and delivered, have tried to extend <b>formal</b> <b>coverage</b> to previously marginalized groups, and have tried to finance this extension fairly. Colombia instituted an implicit two-tiered voucher scheme financed through a proportional wage tax. Chile's financing mechanism is similar but the distribution of benefits is less progressive, so the net effect is less redistributive. Argentina's remodeled obras system went halfway: the financing base is similar and there is some implicit redistribution from richer to poorer obras, but the quality of insurance increases with income. On the face of it, Brazil's health insurance system is less redistributive than those of the other three countries, as no tax is earmarked for financing health insurance. But taxes paid by higher-income taxpayers are not reduced when they choose private insurance, highlighting the problem of examining the health sector independent of the general tax and transfer system.

40|$|This master thesis {{focuses on}} the problem of {{forecasting}} volatility and Value-at-Risk (VaR) in the nancial markets. There are numerous methods for calculating VaR. However, research in this area has not currently reached one universally accepted method that can produce good VaR estimates across dierent data series, and VaR prediction and quality testing is still a very challenging statistical problem. The thesis has two main purposes, the rst is to propose a simple quantile regression model for forecasting one-day-ahead VaR. Our proposed model uses only observable measures of daily, weekly and monthly volatility as input and thus simplies the optimization compared with many models proposed in the literature. The second is to test our proposed model along with other models found in the literature, and compare them to each other in terms of accuracy. The models' performance is evaluated with both the unconditional (Kupiec, 1995) and conditional (Christoersen, 1998) coverage tests. Further, we analyze the results and see if any conclusions can be drawn. In this paper we examine three widely used models to calculate VaR. The models examined are Historical Simulation, RiskMetrics and GARCH(1, 1). We compare these approaches with a new quantile regression model, HAR-QREG and our own proposed model, RHAR-QREG. The study is conducted on four dierent assets, Toyota, Apple, Nike and S&P 500, and the conducted data sample ranges from 03 : 01 : 2000 - 31 : 12 : 2013. We use a rolling window of 1000 days in our study. When subjected to <b>formal</b> <b>coverage</b> tests for out-of-sample VaR predictions, RHARQREG is, overall, more accurate in predicting one-day-ahead VaR compared to the three most popular models used in our study (i. e. Historical Simulation, RiskMetrics and GARCH(1, 1)). However, the HAR-QREG model outperforms all of the models, and is found to be a VaR model that can produce good estimates across dierent datasets. Previous studies argue that the most important return feature to account for when calculating VaR, is volatility clustering. However, our study shows that the most important return characteristic is the distribution of the returns and how well the models capture it. </p...|$|E

DESIGN: Mailed survey using a questionnaire. SETTING: The 16 Canadian residency training programs in family medicine. PARTICIPANTS: Program directors of all 16 Canadian family medicine residency training programs replied. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of programs with formal pharmaceutical policies; number of programs offering <b>formal</b> curriculum <b>coverage</b> of related topics in the field; program practices regarding industry sampling, detailing, sponsorship, and access. RESULTS: Only four of the 16 programs have formal policies or guidelines. Topics generally covered in core curriculum included critical appraisal (13 / 16) and cost trends (11 / 16). Few programs address determinants of prescribing (5 / 16), marketing techniques (4 / 16), provincial drug access programs (6 / 16), or the Canadian Medical Association guidelines on physician-industry interaction (5 / 16). Industry presence and sponsorship in family medicine training is notable, and screening is limited. Great variation exists, and programs are interested in future initiatives.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the representation of}} opera and musicals in the Estonian newspapers comparatively in 2001 and 2006. The field of musical theatre was interesting for several reasons. Both of the genres of the musical theatre are in a rather prominent position in the society. Opera for its historical values and the importance assigned by the national culture policy, and musicals for its popularity in the public. Also important were the widely spread and varying controversial statements and opinions regarding both of the genres. The research {{was focused on the}} general model of representations of both genres of the musical theatre: how often and in what form are they represented, who are the authors and what kind of discoursive practices are used in the media texts about the opera or the musicals. The methods of both quantitative and qualitative content analysis were used to approach these goals. The theoretical framework of the study was based on Stuart Hall’s theory of represen- tation, Roland Barthes’ works on mythology and van Dijk’s concepts of ideology, as well as the discussion over the concepts of high culture, mass culture and popular culture (including Gans’ hierarchy of cultural taste, McQuail’s theory of popular culture etc.). The population of the quantitative study consisted of 440 texts printed in Postimees and Sirp in 2001 and 2006 that were about opera or musicals. Of those, there were 147 texts in 2001 and 130 in 2006 from Postimees, and 114 in 2001 and 49 texts in 2006 from Sirp. The results of the quantitative content analysis showed, that the representation of the genres in both years was rather balanced and equal in numbers, {{with the exception of the}} dominance of opera in Sirp when compared to musicals. The most prominent change in the representation of musicals in Postimees was the transformation from being the subject of culture editors to the subject of entertainment editors, including even the reviews of performances. It is also notable, that the texts about the opera were slightly shorter in 2006 than they were in 2001, as the texts about the musicals were slightly longer in opposite. On the other hand, the quantitative emphasis had turned from news stories to reviews and columns in 2006, which displays a positive change from <b>formal</b> <b>coverage</b> to a more analytical approach. The study showed a similar change towards the increase of the number of analytical texts in Sirp in 2006 – there were more reveiews of both opera and musicals than there were in 2001. 2006 introduced also reviews of opera performances from major opera houses in the world, which was rare in 2001. A quite interesting phenomenon is associated with theatre Vanemuine – the theatre was mentioned more in association with musicals than it was with operas in both years and both newspapers, although the theatre is as active in the genre of opera (or sometimes even more) as it in the field of musicals. The comparison of the discoursive practices found in the texts regarding the opera and the musicals displayed that there is more consensus in the notions associated with opera and there is more contradiction and opposition in the notions associated with musicals. The most dominant statement regarding opera in 2001 is the idea of static or weak direction in terms of artistic conception, and in 2006 the view of opera as a vital genre with strong potential to artistic development. When speaking of musicals, the most important notion is the concept of extraordinariness of musicals (the largest, the unseen etc). In addition to that there are opposing discussions of the artistic value or potential of musicals and the frequent lack of artistic ambition of the producers of musicals. The concept of extraordinariness has diminished by 2006, but the opposing discussion has polarized even more – the discussion of artistic potential of the unfairly underrated genre on one hand and the negative attitude towards musicals as non-theatre or cheap circus on the other...|$|E

Background: Next-generation tumor {{sequencing}} (NGTS) panels, {{which include}} multiple established and novel targets across cancers, are emerging in oncology practice, but lack <b>formal</b> positive <b>coverage</b> by US payers. Lack of coverage may impact access and adoption. This study identified challenges of NGTS coverage by private payers. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 14 NGTS experts on potential NGTS benefits, and with 10 major payers, representing more than 125, 000, 000 enrollees, on NGTS coverage considerations. We used the framework approach of qualitative research for study design and thematic analyses and simple frequencies to further describe findings. Results: All interviewed payers see potential NGTS benefits, but all noted challenges to formal coverage: 80 % state that inherent features of NGTS {{do not fit}} the medical necessity definition required for coverage, 70 % view NGTS as a bundle of targets versus comprehensive tumor characterization and may evaluate each target individually, and 70 % express skepticism regarding new evidence methods proposed for NGTS. Fifty percent of payers expressed sufficient concerns about NGTS adoption and implementation that will preclude their ability to issue positive coverage policies. Conclusions: Payers perceive that NGTS holds significant promise but, in its current form, poses disruptive challenges to coverage policy frameworks. Proactive multidisciplinary efforts to define the direction for NGTS development, evidence generation, and incorporation into coverage policy are necessary to realize its promise and provide patient access.

The analysis is based on a hybrid data set which we created by combining sub-district level information on bank branch availability and the presence of microcredit providers with household level information on poverty, assets, expenditure and so on. The latter was obtained from the nationally representative Household Income Expenditure Survey (HIES) for the year 2005 which sampled 6, 400 rural households. We studied the effect of formal banks by estimating Least Square (OLS) regression models of household per capita expenditure and sub-district level headcount poverty. We found a statistically significant and positive relationship between the number of formal bank branches and household per capita expenditure and a negative association with the proportion of people living below the poverty line. These results were very robust to differences in household assets, occupation and demographic structure. In addition, differential access to NGO programs in the village and microfinance schemes at the sub-district level did not wash out the effects of formal banks on household expenditure. <b>Formal</b> banking <b>coverage</b> also remained negatively associated with headcount measures of poverty at the sub-district level even after controlling for remoteness, vulnerability to natural disasters and access to microfinance schemes.

It extends prior research by testing the moderating effects of country characteristics through multilevel analyses and by considering the possibility of selection effects. The presumption was that parents employ strategies to protect family life from work encroachments and that these strategies are enhanced by reconciliation policies, stronger parenthood ideologies, access to part-time work and higher income levels. Multilevel analyses were based on a subset of 5. 183 parents in 23 countries from the 2005 European Working Conditions Survey that was complemented with country-level data. The negative association between parental work hours and parent–child time indeed varied significantly across countries and was weaker in countries where <b>formal</b> child care <b>coverage</b> was higher, part-time work was less prevalent, and earnings were lower. The effects of part-time work and earnings mainly applied to mothers.

40|$|Abstract. Testing {{application}} {{behavior in}} the presence of I/O failures is extremely difficult. The resources used for testing usually work without failure. Failures typically cannot be initiated on the test suite level and are usually not tested sufficiently. Essentially, each interaction of the application with the environment can result in a failure. The Enforcer tool identifies such potential failures and automatically tests all relevant outcomes of such actions. It combines the structure of unit tests with coverage information and fault injection. By taking advantage of a unit test infrastructure, performance can be improved by orders of magnitude compared to previous approaches. This paper introduces the usage of the Enforcer tool. 1 Introduction Testing is a scalable, economic, and effective way to uncover faults in soft-ware [28, 29]. Even though it is limited to a finite set of example scenarios, it is very flexible and by far the most widespread quality assurance method today. Testing is often carried out without <b>formal</b> rigor. However, <b>coverage</b> measurement tools provide a quantitative measure of the quality of a test suite [14, 29]. Un-covered (and thus untested) code may still contain faults. Tested code is known to have executed successfully under at least one occasion.

40|$|Aims: To measure cardiac tissue doses in {{left-sided}} {{breast cancer}} patients receiving supine tangential field radiotherapy with multileaf collimation (MLC) cardiac shielding {{of the heart and}} to assess the effect on target volume coverage. Materials and methods: Sixty-seven consecutive patients who underwent adjuvant radiotherapy to the left breast (n= 48) or chest wall (n= 19) in 2009 / 2010 were analysed. The heart, left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), whole breast and partial breast clinical target volumes (WBCTV and PBCTV) were outlined retrospectively (the latter only in patients who had undergone breast-conserving surgery [BCS]). The mean heart and LAD NTD and maximum LAD doses (LAD) were calculated for all patients (NTD is a biologically weighted mean dose normalised to 2 Gy fractions using a standard linear quadratic model). Coverage of WBCTV and PBCTV by the 95 % isodose was assessed (BCS patients only). Results: The mean heart NTD (standard deviation) was 0. 8 (0. 3) Gy, the mean LAD NTD 6. 7 (4. 3) Gy and the mean LAD 40. 3 (10. 1) Gy. Coverage of the WBCTV by 95 % isodose was < 90 % in one in three patients and PBCTV coverage < 95 % (range 78 - 94 %) in one in 10 BCS patients. Conclusion: The use of MLC cardiac shielding reduces doses to cardiac tissues at the expense of target tissue <b>coverage.</b> <b>Formal</b> target volume delineation in combination with an assessment of the likelihood of local relapse is recommended in order to aid decisions regarding field and MLC placement. © 2013 The Royal College of Radiologists...|$|R

Three major concerns will accompany this transition. First, a number of weaker banks will fail as the bad loan problems are gradually resolved.
