Within a 12-month period the two {{would go on to}} fight 5 times, with Sam-A winning 4 of those. The one loss would come in 2010 from a controversial <b>down</b> <b>call</b> late in the fight. In this time he emerged as a Yodmuay (super fighter) and became one of the few fighters in Thailand who were making 100,000 baht per fight. In 2010 he split wins over another rival, Rungruanglek Lukprabart. Towards the end of 2010 he would go up 126 pounds and challenge top fighter Nong-O Sit Or at Lumpinee Stadium. Soon after he would stay up in weight and again lose to a bigger fighter, Singthongnoi Por. Telakoon. The size difference proved to be too much for Sam-A.|$|E

After a Terry Glenn score in the second quarter, his second touchdown came to Ben Coates and tied the game at 24. A Jets field goal made it 27-24 when Bledsoe completed a pass to Coates at the 50-yard line on 4th and 2. The Jets disputed the ball spot by line judge Charles Stewart (the ball spot was also roundly criticized by ESPN) but the first <b>down</b> <b>call</b> stood, and Bledsoe found Keith Byars for the game-winning score. A late Jets rally was stopped on an endzone interception by Lawyer Milloy for a 31-27 Patriots win.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Let's Go...Mountaineers" [...] cheer {{originated}} at home {{football games}} as a competition between {{opposite sides of the}} stadium.

As they think of ways they can pull it off, Marcus and Franco suggest a Triple 9 scenario, which {{involves}} an officer <b>down</b> <b>call</b> that sends all of the police to the location of the incident, with Marcus nominating his new partner, Chris Allen (Casey Affleck).

50|$|Ishida {{fought against}} Rigoberto Álvarez for the vacant WBA world super welterweight {{championship}} {{as his first}} expedition match in Tepic, Nayarit, Mexico on October 9, 2010, and lost there. It was after several hours of the fight that Ishida was informed that {{the result was a}} narrow split decision with scores of 112-115, 113-114 and 114-113. Ishida does not think that he lost the fight, partially because of the controversial knock <b>down</b> <b>call</b> against Ishida in the seventh round which appeared to have been a slip, but he did not protest the decision. In the WBA official ratings published on October 15, Álvarez was designated as an interim champion, Ishida was ranked number four, and the regular champion remained vacant. The JBC (Japan Boxing Commission) immediately asked the WBA about the title of that fight. Instead of a reply, the WBA posted an article where they released the championship for the vacant regular title between Álvarez and Trout in December on their official website. As the WBA ordered, Ishida vs. Álvarez was held as a regular championship by the promoter. Ishida, Álvarez, Televisa which aired that fight and the media in many countries had recognized that they fought for the world title. Nevertheless, after all, it was positioned as per the WBA official ratings as a defense of the interim title which Ishida had held.|$|E

50|$|The 2013 {{campaign}} {{started with}} {{high expectations for}} the Wildcats and hopes of contending for a conference title. The 'Cats started the season ranked #22 in the pre-season AP poll and roared to a 4-0 start. ESPN College GameDay came to Evanston {{for the first time}} since 1995 as the #18 Wildcats took on the #4 Ohio State Buckeyes on national television. A controversial fourth <b>down</b> <b>call</b> that saw the officials rule that 'Cats quarterback Kain Colter was stopped when replays indicated Colter had made the line to gain proved pivotal in the 38-30 defeat. The season began to be marred by injuries as All-American Venric Mark and quarterback Kain Colter missed significant playing time with injuries. The Wildcats then dropped four consecutive games that could have just as easily been won. First, NU dropped a 20-17 game against Minnesota, then the 'Cats lost 17-10 to Iowa in overtime. Perhaps the most bitter loss of the season came at Nebraska when the Huskers converted a Hail Mary touchdown pass as time expired to win the game. The following week the 'Cats clung to a 9-6 lead over Michigan when the Wolverines ran their field goal team on with seconds to play; Michigan converted the field goal and won in triple overtime. Northwestern ended a disappointing season with a win however: a 37-34 victory over rival Illinois. The 2013 team finished 5-7, Fitzgerald's second losing campaign since his inaugural season as the Wildcats head coach.|$|E
50|$|Following its {{meeting with}} Wake Forest, Florida State hosted the Clemson Tigers {{in a key}} {{division}} game. Clemson defeated Florida State the previous season 35-30 at Death Valley {{en route to the}} Atlantic Division title and an ACC Championship. The winner of this game has represented the Atlantic Division in the ACC Championship Game {{for the past three years}} with Clemson winning the division title in 2009, Florida State winning the division title in 2010 and Clemson taking the division title the following year. ESPN's College Gameday was on the campus of Florida State University for the game. The program previously visited the school for a game against Oklahoma during the 2011 season. It is their eighth time hosting and the show's twenty-fourth appearance at an FSU game. Florida State won the game 49-37 after trailing by seven at halftime and erasing a fourteen-point deficit in the second half. Clemson struck first when, during the first drive of the game, Tajh Boyd hooked up with Deandre Hopkins for a 60-yd touchdown pass. Florida State responded with a 13-yd touchdown run from Lonnie Pryor. The game then went back and forth throughout the first half with Clemson scoring on a 6-yd touchdown run from Andre Ellington and Florida State scoring with a James Wilder, Jr. 5-yd touchdown run. Clemson took the lead again with a 17-yd touchdown pass from Tajh Boyd to Brandon Ford after capitalizing on an FSU turnover. Clemson went into halftime with the lead. Florida State had many miscues that kept them from points, including two fumbles, two missed field goals, and a questionable 4th <b>down</b> <b>call</b> that kept them from leading.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an {{implementation of a}} simulation tool for mobile cellular networks that uses a mobility model based on users profile, regions and time period characteristics.

The paper also introduces a new channel allocation scheme that uses traffic prediction information for getting adaptability to traffic fluctuations. Results for exchanged signaling load in GSM and IS- 41 / 136 systems and a performance evaluation of the proposed channel allocation scheme comparing with other algorithms are presented for QoS based analysis mainly focusing on blocking probability and handoff failure are extracted using the CELSA simulation environment. 1...|$|E

Your group has faced similar questions before, and you've recorded their advice and the subsequent outcome for each case. If you can trust that no advisor is working against you, then you only need examine a finite set of advisor weight vectors to discover those whichwould have been optimal, historically. This new, robust way to integrate multiple trained classifiers, Advisor Perceptrons (Elder 1992), is demonstrated on six datasets, using five heterogeneous classifiers [...] which we believe combine more fruitfully than homogeneous ones. It is then compared to some common alternative combination techniques and shown to improve generalization accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Once upon a time, {{students}} went to {{the library}} to use the card catalog to find research materials.

This session will focus on how librarians in Reference Services develop course-specific instructional sessions in conjunction with faculty members.
