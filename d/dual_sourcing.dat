Due to short product life cycles, combined with uncertain demand, <b>dual</b> <b>sourcing</b> strategies are {{very common in}} several industries, in particular in the sporting goods or fashion industries. Even though scholars have given some attention {{to the analysis of}} <b>dual</b> <b>sourcing</b> strategies, the importance of the decision-maker's risk preferences has not been covered yet. In this paper we analyse <b>dual</b> <b>sourcing</b> strategies using an extended single-product newsvendor model with two order points. Different risk preferences will be modelled using an exponential utility function. Within realistic parameter ranges, the optimal order quantities can only be numerically computed. The findings of this paper show that <b>dual</b> <b>sourcing</b> strategies are always preferable to an exclusive offshore approach, as long as the onshore ordering costs are smaller than the selling price of the considered product. The more risk-averse the decision-maker, the smaller the offshore order quantity will be.

40|$|The role of {{competition}} in defense procurement has long been controversial due to the extraordinary demand for technological advance, the relatively small production quantities involved {{and the importance of}} learning by doing. Since the early 1980 s, Defense Department policy has encouraged the use {{of competition}} in the production phase of procurement where possible, particularly for relatively simple technologies. Recent theory, however, suggests that splitting production between two bidders ("dual sourcing") produces strong incentives for collusion unless the bidders are unsure of each other's costs, e. g. for sophisticated technologies in the early phases of production. Furthermore, <b>dual</b> <b>sourcing</b> may help discipline contractors in settings where contractual incompleteness is a particular problem. For both these reasons, <b>dual</b> <b>sourcing</b> may be more valuable for complex, rather than simple, technologies. To date, however, there have been no attempts to investigate empirically how technological complexity affects the viability {{of competition in}} procurement. I explore the effects of <b>dual</b> <b>sourcing</b> using a panel dataset comprising 14 missile systems with an average of 12. 5 years of production history per system.

Simple missiles enjoy greater scale economies than complex missiles, but the learning curves for the two missile types are not significantly different. The effects of <b>dual</b> <b>sourcing,</b> though, depend importantly {{on the nature of the}} technology involved: it significantly speeds learning and interferes with scale economies for complex missiles, but has no significant effects for simple ones. <b>Dual</b> <b>sourcing</b> thus produces no apparent savings for simple missiles, but for the average complex missile <b>dual</b> <b>sourcing</b> lowers unit costs by the seventh year of <b>dual</b> <b>sourcing.</b> Whether these potential savings justify the costs of transferring technology to the second source and the possible weakening of R&D incentives remains an open question. ...|$|E

Consider a manufacturer that wants to outsource the manufacturing of two substitute products to external suppliers.

By the backward induction approach, we obtain analytical equilibrium solutions for each decision scenario. By comparing each pair of equilibrium profiles, we find that an appropriate proportion of quality investment sharing by the manufacturer can enable a cooperating strategy with a single supplier to be the dominant strategy. When the manufacturer does not want to share or does not want to share a relatively large portion of its supplier’s quality investment, it will always prefer to develop two competing suppliers when the cost of <b>dual</b> <b>sourcing</b> is sufficiently low.

40|$|Owing to last decades' {{globalization}} and increased customer demands, outsourcing has increased, causing companies {{to spend more}} money on external suppliers, making purchasing a strategic issue for most companies. Mitigating the increased supply risk that follows from this has become an important topic and one way of doing this is by adopting <b>dual</b> <b>sourcing.</b> This often comes with increased costs and the difficulty lies in knowing the benefit received for the cost spent. This thesis is carried out as a case study at Volvo Group Trucks. Today single sourcing is the general rule at Volvo but when disturbance situations arise causing financial impacts on Volvo, the concept of <b>dual</b> <b>sourcing</b> as a risk mitigating option is raised. The purpose of this thesis has therefore been to investigate <b>dual</b> <b>sourcing</b> of components as a way to mitigate risk and through this, enhance the supplier risk management process at Volvo. To fulfill the purpose, 36 interviews with employees within different departments at Volvo have been held as well as 4 interviews with purchasing representatives from external companies. Also, case studies of suppliers causing disturbance to Volvo have been conducted with the purpose of comparing the total costs arising from the disturbance situation with the costs of the hypothetical situation of having a dual source in place during the disturbance. The main conclusion of this thesis is that <b>dual</b> <b>sourcing</b> should not primarily be used to mitigate risk due to the associated costs with it.
