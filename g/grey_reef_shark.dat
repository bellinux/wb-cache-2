5|$|In older literature, the {{scientific}} {{name of this}} species was often given as C. menisorrah. The blacktail reef shark (C. wheeleri), native to the western Indian Ocean, is now regarded as the same species as the <b>grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> by most authors. It was originally distinguished from the <b>grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> by a white tip on the first dorsal fin, a shorter snout, and one fewer upper tooth row on each side. Based on morphological characters, vertebral counts, and tooth shapes, Garrick (1982) concluded the <b>grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> is most {{closely related to the}} silvertip shark (C. albimarginatus). This interpretation was supported by a 1992 allozyme phylogenetic analysis by Lavery.|$|E
5|$|Although still {{abundant}} at Cocos Island {{and other}} relatively pristine sites, grey reef sharks {{are susceptible to}} localized depletion due to their slow reproductive rate, specific habitat requirements, and tendency to stay within a certain area. The IUCN has assessed the <b>grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> as Near Threatened; this shark is taken by multispecies fisheries {{in many parts of}} its range and used for various products such as shark fin soup and fishmeal. Another threat is the continuing degradation of coral reefs from human development. There is evidence of substantial declines in some populations. Anderson et al. (1998) reported, in the Chagos Archipelago, <b>grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> numbers in 1996 had fallen to 14% of 1970s levels. Robbins et al. (2006) found <b>grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> populations in Great Barrier Reef fishing zones had declined by 97% compared to no-entry zones (boats are not allowed). In addition, no-take zones (boats are allowed but fishing is prohibited) had the same levels of depletion as fishing zones, illustrating the severe effect of poaching. Projections suggested the shark population would fall to 0.1% of pre-exploitation levels within 20 years without additional conservation measures. One possible avenue for conservation is ecotourism, as grey reef sharks are suitable for shark-watching ventures, and profitable diving sites now enjoy protection in many countries, such as the Maldives.|$|E
5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} {{is tall and}} {{moderately}} falcate (sickle-shaped), with the origin over the pectoral fin rear tips. It {{is followed by a}} low midline ridge running to the second dorsal fin. The second dorsal fin originates over the anal fin. The pectoral fins are large with pointed tips. The coloration is brownish gray above and white below, with a faint white stripe on the sides. The edges of the fins are darker but not prominently marked. The Galapagos shark can be distinguished from the dusky shark in having taller first and second dorsal fins and larger teeth, and it can be distinguished from the <b>grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> in having a less robust body and less pointed first dorsal fin tip. However, these characters can be difficult to discern in the field. These similar species also have different numbers of precaudal (before the tail) vertebrae: 58 in the Galapagos shark, 8697 in the dusky shark, 110119 in the <b>grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark.</b>|$|E
5|$|On the {{infrequent}} {{occasions when}} they swim in oceanic waters, <b>grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> often associate with marine mammals or large pelagic fishes, such as sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus). There is {{an account of}} around 25 <b>grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> following a large pod of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.), along with 25 silky sharks (C. falciformis) and a single silvertip shark. Rainbow runners (Elagatis bipinnulata) have been observed rubbing against <b>grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>sharks,</b> using the sharks' rough skin to scrape off parasites.|$|R

25|$|<b>Grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> {{are usually}} less than 1.9 metres (6.2ft) long. Despite their {{moderate}} size, <b>grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> actively expel most other shark species from favored habitats. In areas where this species co-exists with the blacktip <b>reef</b> <b>shark,</b> the latter species occupy the shallow flats while the <b>grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> stay in deeper water. Many <b>grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> {{have a home}} range on a specific area of the reef, to which they continually return. However, they are social rather than territorial. During the day, these sharks often form groups of 5–20 individuals near coral reef drop-offs, splitting up in the evening as the sharks begin to hunt. They are found over continental and insular shelves, preferring the leeward (away {{from the direction of}} the current) sides of coral reefs with clear water and rugged topography. They are frequently found near the drop-offs at the outer edges of the reef, and less commonly within lagoons. On occasion, this shark may venture several kilometers out into the open ocean.|$|R
5|$|The whitetip reef shark {{is one of}} {{the three}} most common sharks inhabiting the reefs of the Indo-Pacific, the other two being the blacktip reef shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus) and the <b>grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos). The habitat {{preferences}} of this species overlap those of the other two, though it does not tend to frequent very shallow water like the blacktip reef shark, nor the outer reef like the <b>grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark.</b> The whitetip reef shark swims with strong undulations of its body, and unlike other requiem sharks can lie motionless on the bottom and actively pump water over its gills for respiration. This species is most active at night or during slack tide, and spends much of the day resting inside caves singly or in small groups, arranged in parallel or stacked atop one another. Off Hawaii, these sharks may be found sheltering inside underwater lava tubes, while off Costa Rica they are often seen lying in the open on sandy flats.|$|E
5|$|Dutch {{ichthyologist}} Pieter Bleeker {{first described}} the <b>grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> in 1856 as Carcharias (Prionodon) amblyrhynchos, {{in the scientific}} journal Natuurkundig Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch-Indië. Later authors moved this species to the genus Carcharhinus. The type specimen was a -long female from the Java Sea. Other common names used for this shark around the world include black-vee whaler, bronze whaler, Fowler's whaler shark, graceful shark, graceful whaler shark, grey shark, grey whaler shark, longnose blacktail shark, school shark, and shortnose blacktail shark. Some of these names are also applied to other species.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} {{blacktip reef shark}} (C. melanopterus) and the whitetip reef shark (Triaenodon obesus), the <b>grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> {{is one of the}} three most common sharks inhabiting Indo-Pacific reefs. They {{actively}} expel most other shark species from favored habitats, even species larger in size. In areas where this species co-exists with the blacktip reef shark, the latter species occupies the shallow flats, while the former stays in deeper water. Areas with a high abundance of grey reef sharks tend to contain few sandbar sharks (C. plumbeus), and vice versa; {{this may be due to}} their similar diets causing competitive exclusion.|$|E

500|$|Most {{observed}} displays by <b>grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> {{have been}} {{in response to a}} diver (or submersible) approaching and following it from a few meters behind and above. They also perform the display towards moray eels, and in one instance towards a much larger great hammerhead (which subsequently withdrew). However, they have never been seen performing threat displays towards each other. This suggests the display is primarily a response to potential threats (i.e. predators) rather than competitors. As <b>grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> are not territorial, they are speculated to be defending a critical volume of [...] "personal space" [...] around themselves. Compared to sharks from French Polynesia or Micronesia, <b>grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> from the Indian Ocean and western Pacific are not as aggressive and less given to displaying.|$|R

5|$|Based on {{morphological}} similarities, Jack Garrick in 1982 grouped {{this species}} with the bignose shark (C. altimus) and the sandbar shark (C. plumbeus), while Leonard Compagno in 1988 placed {{it as the}} sister species of the <b>grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> (C. amblyrhynchos). A phylogenetic analysis based on allozyme data, published by Gavin Naylor in 1992, indicated that the Caribbean reef shark is the sister taxon to a clade formed by the Galapagos shark (C. galapagensis), dusky shark (C. obscurus), oceanic whitetip shark (C. longimanus), and the blue shark (Prionace glauca). However, more work is required to fully resolve the interrelationships within Carcharhinus.|$|E
5|$|The <b>grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> has a streamlined, {{moderately}} stout {{body with}} a long, blunt snout and large, round eyes. The upper and lower jaws each have 13 or 14 teeth (usually 14 in the upper and 13 in the lower). The upper teeth are triangular with slanted cusps, while the bottom teeth have narrower, erect cusps. The tooth serrations are larger in the upper jaw than in the lower. The first dorsal fin is medium-sized, {{and there is no}} ridge running between it and the second dorsal fin. The pectoral fins are narrow and falcate (sickle-shaped).|$|E
5|$|During group interactions, Galapagos {{sharks are}} {{dominant}} to blacktip sharks (C. limbatus) but deferent to silvertip sharks (C. albimarginatus) of equal size. When confronted or cornered, the Galapagos shark may perform a threat display {{similar to that}} of the <b>grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark,</b> in which the shark performs an exaggerated, rolling swimming motion while arching its back, lowering its pectoral fins, puffing out its gills, and gaping its jaw. The shark may also swing its head from side to side, so as to keep the perceived threat within its field of vision. A known parasite of the Galapagos shark is the flatworm Dermophthirius carcharhini, which attaches to the shark's skin. In one account, a bluefin trevally (Caranax melampygus) was seen rubbing against the rough skin of a Galapagos shark to rid itself of parasites.|$|E
5|$|<b>Grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> are prey {{for larger}} sharks, {{such as the}} silvertip shark. At Rangiroa Atoll in French Polynesia, great hammerheads (Sphyrna mokarran) feed opportunistically on <b>grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> that are {{exhausted}} from pursuing mates. Known parasites of this species include the nematode Huffmanela lata and several copepod species that attach to the sharks' skin, and juvenile stages of the isopods Gnathia trimaculata and G. grandilaris that attach to the gill filaments and septa (the dividers between each gill).|$|R
40|$|<b>Reef</b> <b>sharks</b> {{clean up}} with a novel inshore mutualistic {{interaction}} Parasite removal by cleaner fish provides significant health benefits {{to a variety of}} coral reef fish, particularly roving carnivores and herbivores (Grutter et al. 2003). For <b>grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos), however, such cleaning events are only known to occur sporadically, on exposed oceanic reefs (O’Shea et al. 2010). This is because hosts on cleaning stations must remain relatively stationary (Côte ́ et al. 1998), a behaviour which requires constant current flow for <b>grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>sharks.</b> Within the central region of Ningaloo Reef (S 23. 1, E 113. 8), an 8 -m-deep lagoonal Turbinaria coral bommie provides the only reported example of <b>grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> utilising a shallow-water inshore cleaner fish station (Fig. 1 a).

500|$|<b>Grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> {{are active}} {{at all times}} of the day, with {{activity}} levels peaking at night.

Their home range is about [...] At Enewetak in the Marshall Islands, <b>grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> from different parts of the reef exhibit different social and ranging behaviors. Sharks on the outer ocean reefs tend to be nomadic, swimming long distances along the reef, while those around lagoon reefs and underwater pinnacles stay within defined daytime and night-time home ranges. Where there are strong tidal currents, <b>grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> move against the water: towards the shore with the ebbing tide and back out to sea with the rising tide. This may allow them to better detect the scent of their prey, or afford them the cover of turbid water in which to hunt.|$|R
5|$|The <b>grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> is {{native to}} the Indian and Pacific Oceans. In the Indian Ocean, it occurs from South Africa to India, {{including}} Madagascar and nearby islands, the Red Sea, and the Maldives. In the Pacific Ocean, it is found from southern China to northern Australia and New Zealand, including the Gulf of Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia. This species has also been reported from numerous Pacific islands, including American Samoa, the Chagos Archipelago, Easter Island, Christmas Island, the Cook Islands, the Marquesas Islands, the Tuamotu Archipelago, Guam, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, New Caledonia, the Marianas Islands, Palau, the Pitcairn Islands, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, the Hawaiian Islands, and Vanuatu.|$|E
5|$|Grey reef {{sharks are}} fast-swimming, agile predators that feed {{primarily}} on free-swimming bony fishes and cephalopods. Their aggressive demeanor {{enables them to}} dominate many other shark species on the reef, despite their moderate size. Many grey reef sharks have a home range on a specific area of the reef, to which they continually return. However, they are social rather than territorial. During the day, these sharks often form groups of five to 20 individuals near coral reef drop-offs, splitting up in the evening as the sharks begin to hunt. Adult females also form groups in very shallow water, where the higher water temperature may accelerate their growth or that of their unborn young. Like other members of its family, the <b>grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> is viviparous, meaning the mother nourishes her embryos through a placental connection. Litters of one to six pups are born every other year.|$|E
5|$|Grey reef {{sharks are}} often curious about divers {{when they first}} enter the water and may {{approach}} quite closely, though they lose interest on repeat dives. They can become dangerous {{in the presence of}} food, and tend to be more aggressive if encountered in open water rather than on the reef. There have been several known attacks on spearfishers, possibly by mistake, when the shark struck at the speared fish close to the diver. This species will also attack if pursued or cornered, and divers should immediately retreat (slowly and always facing the shark) if it begins to perform a threat display. Photographing the display should not be attempted, as the flash from a camera is known to have incited at least one attack. Although of modest size, they are capable of inflicting significant damage: during one study of the threat display, a <b>grey</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> attacked the researchers' submersible multiple times, leaving tooth marks in the plastic windows and biting off one of the propellers. The shark consistently launched its attacks from a distance of , which it was able to cover in a third of a second.
