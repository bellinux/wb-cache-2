Still, in {{addition}} to already discussed theories of dualism (particularly the Christian and Cartesian models) there are new theories {{in the defense of}} dualism. Naturalistic dualism comes from Australian philosopher, David Chalmers (born 1966) who argues there is an explanatory gap between objective and subjective experience that cannot be bridged by reductionism because consciousness is, at least, logically autonomous of the physical properties upon which it supervenes. According to Chalmers, a naturalistic account of property dualism requires a new <b>fundamental</b> <b>category</b> of properties described by new laws of supervenience; the challenge being analogous to that of understanding electricity based on the mechanistic and Newtonian models of materialism prior to Maxwell's equations.|$|E

40|$|The {{fundamental}} ontology of {{the world}} is given by its <b>fundamental</b> <b>categories.</b> Categorical fundamentality is fundamentality in terms of the metaphysically prior: it is that in which everything else in the world consists. Following Peter van Inwagen (forthcoming), take divisions between ontologically <b>fundamental</b> <b>categories</b> to mark “real divisions between things. ” These divisions mark out the fundamental categorical structure {{of the world}}: i. e., the structure of the <b>fundamental</b> <b>categories</b> is defined by divisions between <b>fundamental</b> <b>categories.</b> Speaking metaphorically, the fundamental categorical structure of the world carves the world at its fundamental joints. The project of determining the fundamental categorical structure of the world descends (arguably) from Aristotle, who started by dividing the realm of being into at leas...|$|R

Idealists do not reject universals as arbitrary names; rather, they treat universals as <b>fundamental</b> <b>categories</b> of pure reason (or as secondary concepts derived from those <b>fundamental</b> <b>categories).</b> Universals, in idealism, are intrinsically tied to the rationality of the subject making the judgment.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we argue that}} there are no {{categories}} of being⎯at least not in the robust metaphysical sense of something fundamental. Central arguments that metaphysicians provide in support of <b>fundamental</b> <b>categories,</b> such as indispensability and theoretical utility arguments, are not adequate to guarantee their existence. We illustrate this point by examining Jonathan Lowe’s [2006] four-category ontology, and indicating its shortcomings. In contrast, we offer an alternative, no-category ontology, which dispenses with any <b>fundamental</b> <b>categories</b> of being, and provides a deflationary understanding of any categorization in terms of concepts. Concepts, we insist, as opposed to <b>fundamental</b> ontological <b>categories,</b> can always be revised, refined, and recast. A distinctive deflationary, no-category ontology then emerges...|$|R
50|$|As a {{consequence}} of the antisymmetry, the <b>fundamental</b> <b>category</b> C of a pospace is loop-free i.e. for all objects x and y, if both homsets C(x,y) and C(y,x) are nonempty, then x=y and C(x,x) is a singleton.|$|E
5000|$|While the <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Category</b> {{construction}} drastically {{reduces the}} size of the homsets of DX, it leaves its collection of objects unchanged. And yet, if X is the geometric model of some concurrent program P, this collection is uncountable. The Category of Components was introduced to find a full subcategory of the <b>Fundamental</b> <b>category</b> with as few objects as possible though it contains all the relevant information from the original. If [...] is a loop-free category, then its category of components [...] can be described in the language of Category Theory without assuming [...] is the <b>fundamental</b> <b>category</b> of some directed space. In this case the intuitive notion of insignificant morphisms is formalised as a collection [...] of morphisms of [...] satisfying some stability properties and whose elements both preserve the past of their source and the future of their target. Then [...] is defined as the quotient [...] which is proven to be equivalent to the localization of a category [...] The category of components of a PV program P is then defined as [...] where [...] is the geometric model of P. As an interesting property, the category of components of any PV program is finite.|$|E
50|$|Given X {{the model}} of some {{concurrent}} program P, the homsets of the <b>fundamental</b> <b>category</b> of X are countable. In addition, if no looping instruction occurs in P, then the homsets of X are finite. This is the case when P is a PV program in the sense originally given by Dijkstra. In comparison all the nontrivial homsets of the category of directed paths DX are uncountable.|$|E

50|$|Another British criminologist, Steve Hall, goes a {{step further}} {{to suggest that the}} term 'moral panic' is a <b>fundamental</b> <b>category</b> error. Hall argues that {{although}} some crimes are sensationalized by the media, in the general structure of the crime/control narrative the ability of the existing state and criminal justice system to protect the public is also overstated. Public concern is whipped up only for the purpose of being soothed, which produces not panic but the opposite, comfort and complacency.|$|E

It has certainly been argued that mainstream feminism has been guilty of homophobia in its failure to integrate sexuality as a <b>fundamental</b> <b>category</b> of gendered inquiry, and its treatment of lesbianism as a separate issue. In this respect, Adrienne Rich's (1980) classic text [...] "Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence" [...] is instructive and one of landmarks in lesbian feminism.|$|E
50|$|Lowth {{seems to}} have been the first modern Bible scholar to notice or draw {{attention}} to the poetic structure of the Psalms and much of the prophetic literature of the Old Testament. In Lecture 19 he sets out the classic statement of parallelism, which remains the most <b>fundamental</b> <b>category</b> for understanding Hebrew poetry. He identifies three forms of parallelism, the synonymous, antithetic and synthetic (i.e., balance only in the manner of expression without either synonymy or antithesis). This idea has been influential in Old Testament Studies to the present day.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to execute a {{financial}} analysis of the Czech industry from 2002 to 2006. The <b>fundamental</b> <b>categories</b> of indicators were analysed - profitability, activity, cost, debt and liqudity ratios.

The outcome of my research is a statement that all <b>fundamental</b> <b>categories</b> of indicators developed positively. The most obvious positive development can be observed at return on assets which was caused by shortening of assets turnover and increasing of return on revenues. Furthermore, the improvement of debt and liquidity ratios of Czech industrial firms indicates that during the analysed time period the financial stability was increased...|$|R

5000|$|Von Guericke sidestepped the vexed {{question}} {{of the meaning of}} [...] "nothing" [...] by asserting that all objective reality fell into one of two categories - the created and the uncreated. Space and time were objectively real but were uncreated, whereas matter was created. In this way he created a new <b>fundamental</b> <b>category</b> alongside Aristotle's category of substance, that of the uncreated. His understanding of space is theological and similar to that expressed by Newton in the General Scholium to the Principia. For instance, von Guericke writes (Book II, Chapter VII): [...] "For God cannot be contained in any location, nor in any vacuum, nor in any space, for He Himself is, of His nature, location and vacuum." ...|$|E

50|$|His central {{category}} {{is that of}} essence, which constitutes the ultimate ontological ground. Equated by Cuclin with the pure nothingness, but a positive nothingness, like the Buddhist nirvana, the essence it is roughly an equivalent of the spirit, but it differs greatly because it presents itself as a system of harmonics, like an absolute sound composed of infinitely many harmonics, each one bearing a specific function within the whole. This realm of essence, governed {{by the laws of}} harmony (which laws we know from the science of music) has a will, and a purpose for the realising of which the will mobilises. The purpose of this great harmonic system is to acquire self-consciousness. Therefore, the essence degrades itself in an impure mode, the substance, which is the second <b>fundamental</b> <b>category</b> of Cuclin's metaphysics.|$|E

50|$|Personalism {{flourished in}} the early 20th century at Boston University in a {{movement}} known as Boston Personalism led by theologian Borden Parker Bowne. Bowne emphasized the person as the <b>fundamental</b> <b>category</b> for explaining reality and asserted that only persons are real. He stood in opposition to certain forms of materialism which would describe persons as mere particles of matter. For example, against the argument that persons are insignificant specks of dust in the vast universe, Bowne {{would say that it}} is impossible for the entire universe to exist apart from a person to experience it. Ontologically speaking, the person is “larger” than the universe because the universe is but one small aspect of the person who experiences it. Personalism affirms the existence of the soul. Most personalists assert that God is real and that God is a person (or as in Christian trinitarianism, three 'persons', although {{it is important to note}} that the nonstandard meaning of the word 'person' in this theological context is significantly different from Bowne's usage).|$|E
