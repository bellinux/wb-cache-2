The Earth is also {{rotating}} from west to east, at about 28km/min at the Equator, but as the Moon <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same direction as the Earth's spin at about 61km/min, the umbra almost always appears to move in a roughly west-east direction across a map of the Earth at the speed of the Moon's orbital velocity minus the Earth's rotational velocity.|$|E

25|$|A {{standing}} wave, {{also known}} as a stationary wave, is a wave that remains in a constant position.

25|$|He {{observed}} analogous {{trends in}} the field of repetitive or transposed genomic elements (TEs) including retroposed elements. These elements were initially considered to be junk, littering genomes, and proposed by only a few to constitute raw material for fortuitous and only occasional exaptations, and to be responsible for the plasticity of genomes and the modular architecture of genes. The current tide <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposite direction. A plethora of functions have been assigned to TEs, one example being the bewildering spectrum of tasks allocated to the evolutionarily young primate-specific Alu elements. Such sweeping interpretations should be challenged.|$|E

25|$|With {{the aim of}} {{protecting}} models and projecting a healthier body image, Spain, Italy, Brazil, and Israel, “passed bills that prohibit models from working with a Body Mass Index (BMI) below 18.5”. The UK and U.S., chose to use less compelling tactics of cultivating the general public through the promotion of education campaigns in society. France on the other hand, introduced a new regulation this year preventing the employment of extremely skinny models, {{and the need for}} a medical certificate to verify their health. This was an update to the previous law passed that prohibited agencies from using models with a BMI lower than 18. France is also working on ensuring retailers specify airbrushed images in magazines, websites, and advertisements. However, some argue that these laws may not be effective as, majority of individuals are already aware of digital retouching techniques, and may even use it themselves. Due to the criticisms surrounding the glamourising of eating disorders, brands are actively playing their part in cultivating better body images too. Fashion conglomerates; Kering and LVMH, recently “announced that they will no longer hire models smaller than a U.S. size 2”. Not only will this improve the working conditions of models, both companies hope it may inspire others to follow suit. Although, the industry <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right direction, it is arguable that the banning of size zero could be seen as a discriminatory act; similar to thin shaming. For that reasons, focus should be placed on altering beauty norms, rather than blame the wearer for their size. Moreover, the announcement of a small and minimum dress size, which does not fit the average body type of most countries, continues to “send the message that super slim body types is the ‘ideal’”.|$|E
500|$|Having been {{released}} by Stevenage {{at the end}} of the 2010–11 season, Odubade signed for Conference National side Gateshead on 7 June 2011. He joined Gateshead on a free transfer, signing for the club alongside Eddie Odhiambo; the two had previously played alongside each other at Oxford United, Stevenage, and Newport County. On joining Gateshead, Odubade said [...] "I have parted company with Stevenage on good terms and this is now a new chapter for me. Gateshead is a good club that <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right direction and I'm sure we can kick on next season. I don't look back with any regrets as things happen for a reason. I am always looking forward. Gateshead is a new challenge for me and I can only see good things coming from it". He made his Gateshead debut on 13 August 2011 in the club's 3–2 away win against Kidderminster Harriers at Aggborough, assisting Kris Gate's goal in the 80th minute. Odubade scored his first goal for Gateshead three days later at Gateshead International Stadium in Gateshead's 3–0 win against Mansfield Town, which was voted Goal of the Season in the club's end of season awards. His first season at Gateshead was disrupted by two-foot injuries midway through the campaign, with Odubade breaking his metatarsal bone on two occasions, subsequently missing a total of 18 games. Despite the injuries, he made 34 appearances throughout the season, scoring seven times. He signed a one-year contract extension with Gateshead in May 2012.|$|E

It conferred 1,822 degrees in 2007 and offers community service projects serving New York, Jewish communities, the United States and Canada. The university has run an operating deficit for seven consecutive years. In 2014, it lost $84 million, and in 2013, it suffered {{a loss of}} $64 million.
