500|$|The ESRB enforces {{guidelines}} {{that have been}} adopted by the video game industry {{in order to ensure}} responsible advertising and marketing practices. These include ensuring that game packaging, advertisements, and trailers properly display rating information, restricting where advertising materials for games rated [...] "Teen" [...] or higher can appear, forbidding publishers from [...] "glamoriz or exploiting" [...] a game's rating in advertising, and requiring online marketing of games rated [...] "Mature" [...] or higher to be restricted to users who are appropriately aged. This allows the ESRB to restrict video <b>game</b> <b>advertising</b> [...] "to consumers for whom the product is not rated as appropriate." [...] The board also forbids ratings from other organizations from being shown alongside ESRB ratings on publishers' websites or social media outlets. A group of online gaming publications known as the ESRB Website Council operates under a similar code of conduct, which requires them to display ESRB ratings information for games that they cover, and implement systems to restrict access to audiovisual content depicting M or AO-rated games to users who are appropriately aged.|$|E
500|$|The website {{decided against}} showing video <b>game</b> <b>advertising.</b> Despite {{reaching}} a million in monthly unique visitors, {{it failed to}} generate ad revenue. Heldman blamed it on the 2009 recession, which he described as [...] "a perfect storm". In September 2009, John Keefer left the website to write for GamePolitics.com. In December 2009, the company acquired gamerDNA, Inc. One month after the acquisition, the editorial staff {{and most of the}} management on authority {{of the board of directors}} were laid off. The editorial staff included former Joystiq writer Kyle Orland, Scott Jones, former associate producer of The Daily Show John Teti, Evan Narcisse, James Fudge, Ryan Kuo, managing editor Elise Vogel, and Chief Marketing Officer Anne Mischler. In response to the layoffs, Chris Heldman resigned as CEO in protest. Original gamerDNA CEO Jon Radoff mentioned he only learned of this through inquiring journalists. The day before, in a meeting between Crispy Gamers videographer John Teti and member of the board and representative of Constellation Ventures Tom Wasserman, Wasserman mentioned his displeasure of the site's underwhelming traffic and ad revenue. The board of directors decided to take the website to a [...] "gaming focused ad network" [...] direction as a result. In July 2011, gamerDNA was acquired by Live Gamer. At that time, the company was still operating Crispy Gamer. Kyle Orland stated in January 2012 that the website was defunct.|$|E

5000|$|Another video <b>game</b> <b>advertising</b> {{technique}} {{consists of}} advertising within a game itself. Since {{the intent of}} in-game advertising is typically commercial rather than political, some consider such advertisements {{to make up a}} category of their own. In-game advertising is similar to subtle advertising in films, where the advertising content is within the [...] "world" [...] of the movie. Thus billboards, storefronts, posters, apparel, vehicles, weapons, fliers, sponsored product placement, and the interplay between the player and these elements in the game allow for a great degree of virtual advertisement. Examples include billboards advertising for (and product placement of) Bawls energy drink in Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel, and billboards for Adidas sportswear in FIFA International Soccer.|$|E

50|$|Sight screens have, on occasion, {{not been}} {{large enough to}} entirely cover the {{critical}} area for the batsman to effectively view the bowler's delivery. Groundskeepers may make such decisions to allow for more spectators into the ground. Similarly, sight screens {{have in the past}} been used for display advertising, compromising their darkness (in limited overs matches) or whiteness (in Tests). On such occasions, batting sides have often expressed frustration, especially if particular batsmen experienced difficulty in effectively seeing the ball during a fast bowler's delivery. Jacques Kallis succumbed to an Andrew Flintoff full toss at Edgbaston Cricket Ground under these circumstances during South Africa's tour of England in 2008, an incident that triggered much debate at the time. In today's <b>game,</b> <b>advertising</b> in ICC-sanctioned Test matches is only allowed on the sight screen behind the wicket-keeper, so that it must be removed every other over and then replaced again after the next over is played from the other end.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Game</b> <b>{{advertising}}</b> - In-Game {{advertising is}} defined as [...] "inclusion of products or brands within a digital game." [...] The game allows brands or products to place ads within their game, either in a subtle manner or {{in the form of}} an advertisement banner. There are many factors that exist in whether brands are successful in their advertising of their brand/product, these being: Type of game, technical platform, 3-D and 4-D technology, game genre, congruity of brand and game, prominence of advertising within the game. Individual factors consist of attitudes towards placement advertisements, game involvement, product involvement, flow or entertainment. The attitude towards the advertising also takes into account not only the message shown but also the attitude towards the game. Dependent of how enjoyable the game is will determine how the brand is perceived, meaning if the game isn’t very enjoyable the consumer may subconsciously have a negative attitude towards the brand/product being advertised. In terms of Integrated Marketing Communication [...] "integration of advertising in digital games into the general advertising, communication, and marketing strategy of the firm" [...] is an important as it results in a more clarity about the brand/product and creates a larger overall effect.|$|E
