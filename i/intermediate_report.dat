50|$|The first general {{method for}} {{preparation}} of sulfene as an <b>intermediate,</b> <b>reported</b> simultaneously in 1962 by Gilbert Stork and by Günther Optiz, involved removal of hydrogen chloride from methanesulfonyl chloride using triethylamine {{in the presence}} of an enamine as trapping agent. The formation of a thietane 1,1-dioxide derivative was taken as evidence for the intermediacy of sulfene. Because of the highly electrophilic character of sulfene, the use of amines presents difficulties, since they can intercept the sulfene to form complexes, which may display reduced activity in trapping reactions compared to sulfene itself. A simple alternative which avoids the use of amines involves desilylation of trimethylsilylmethanesulfonyl chloride with cesium fluoride {{in the presence of}} trapping agents.|$|R

40|$|Catalytic carbon-carbon bond {{formation}} based on cross-coupling reactions plays {{a central role}} in the production of natural products, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and organic materials. Coupling reactions of a variety of organometallic reagents and organic halides have changed the face of modern synthetic chemistry. However, the high reactivity and poor selectivity of common organolithium reagents have largely prohibited their use as a viable partner in direct catalytic cross-coupling. Here we report that in the presence of a Pd-phosphine catalyst, a wide range of alkyl-, aryl- and heteroaryl-lithium reagents undergo selective cross-coupling with aryl- and alkenyl-bromides. The process proceeds quickly under mild conditions (room temperature) and avoids the notorious lithium halogen exchange and homocoupling. The preparation of key alkyl-, aryl- and heterobiaryl <b>intermediates</b> <b>reported</b> here highlights the potential of these cross-coupling reactions for medicinal chemistry and material science. ...|$|R
