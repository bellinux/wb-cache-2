5|$|As with Parcells {{eight years}} previous, one of Handley's first major {{decisions}} involved replacing Phil Simms as starting quarterback. Jeff Hostetler {{was named the}} team's starter. Though the Giants won their opening game in an NFC Championship Game rematch against the 49ers, 16–14, they lost three out of their next four games to drop to 2–3. Though they rallied to finish the season 8–8, and Simms reclaimed his starting job later in the year, the <b>excitement</b> <b>that</b> surrounded the Giants the previous year was gone. One of the few promising young players to emerge on the team was second–year running back Rodney Hampton, who led the Giants in rushing with 1,059 yards.|$|E
5|$|McBride {{was a fan}} {{of boxing}} and baseball, but knew little about football. He only grew {{interested}} in the sport in 1940, when his son Arthur Jr. was a student the University of Notre Dame and he attended Notre Dame Fighting Irish football games in South Bend, Indiana. He was drawn by the <b>excitement</b> <b>that</b> surrounded football and thought a professional team could be profitable. In 1942, McBride made overtures to supermarket heir Dan Reeves about buying his Cleveland Rams, a National Football League team, but Reeves rebuffed him. In 1944, however, Chicago Tribune sports editor Arch Ward proposed a new professional league called the All-America Football Conference. McBride, who knew Ward from his days in the newspaper business, eagerly signed on {{as the owner of}} the eight-team circuit's Cleveland franchise.|$|E
5|$|As with Parcells {{eight years}} previous, one of Handley's first major {{decisions}} {{as head coach}} involved replacing Phil Simms as the starting quarterback. Jeff Hostetler, who had led the Giants to a win in the Super Bowl, was named as the team's Opening Day starting quarterback. Though the Giants won their opening game in an NFC Championship Game rematch against the San Francisco 49ers 16–14, they lost three out of their next four games to drop to 2–3. Though they rallied to a record of 7-5 after a dramatic 21-14 win at Tampa Bay in week 13 and were {{in the hunt for}} a post-season spot, the Giants lost their next three behind Phil Simms who reclaimed his starting position when Hostetler went down with a broken back. Hostetler threw five touchdowns in his 12 starts, while Simms threw eight in his four starts. The <b>excitement</b> <b>that</b> had surrounded the Giants the previous year was gone. One of the few promising young players to emerge during the year was second–year running back Rodney Hampton, who led the Giants in rushing with 1,059yards, while also catching 43 passes. The season was also marked by the decline of Lawrence Taylor. Although Taylor still finished with a respectable 7 sacks, 1991 marked {{the first time in his}} career he was not elected to the Pro Bowl.|$|E

25|$|Inhaling nitrites relaxes smooth muscles {{throughout}} the body, including the sphincter {{muscles of the}} anus and the vagina. Smooth muscle surrounds the body's blood vessels and when relaxed causes these vessels to dilate resulting in an immediate increase in heart rate and blood flow {{throughout the}} body, producing a sensation of heat and <b>excitement</b> <b>that</b> usually lasts {{for a couple of}} minutes. When these vessels dilate, a further result is an immediate decrease in blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|From 1953 the US had {{increasingly}} {{concentrated on}} the fast pinch concept. Some of these machines had produced neutrons, and these were initially associated with fusion. There was so much <b>excitement</b> <b>that</b> several other researchers quickly entered the field as well. Among these was Stirling Colgate, but his experiments quickly led him to conclude that fusion was not taking place. According to M-theory, the only theoretical study of high-power plasmas at the time, {{the temperature of the}} plasma could be determined from the current flowing through it. When Colgate ran the calculation, the temperatures in the plasma were far below the requirements for fusion.|$|E

25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1960s, Sutherland had already established a reputation as a diva with a voice out of the ordinary. She sang Lucia to great acclaim in Paris in 1960 and, in 1961, at La Scala and the Metropolitan Opera. In 1960, she sang a superb Alcina at La Fenice, Venice, where she was nicknamed La Stupenda ("The Stunning One"). Lucia di Lammermoor generated so much <b>excitement</b> <b>that</b> standees began lining up at 7:30 that morning. Her singing of the Mad Scene drew a thunderous 12-minute ovation. Sutherland would soon be praised as La Stupenda in newspapers around the world. Later that year (1960), Sutherland sang Alcina at the Dallas Opera, with which she made her US debut.|$|E
25|$|Yet another {{explanation}} of the high correlation between extraversion and happiness comes from the study by Ashton, Lee, and Paunonen (2002). They suggested that the core element of extraversion {{is a tendency to}} behave in ways that attract, hold, and enjoy social attention, and not reward sensitivity. They claimed that one of the fundamental qualities of social attention is its potential of being rewarding. Therefore, if a person shows positive emotions of enthusiasm, energy, and <b>excitement,</b> <b>that</b> person is seen favorably by others and he or she gains others' attention. This favorable reaction from others likely encourages extraverts to engage in further extraverted behavior. Ashton, Lee, and Paunonen's (2002) study showed that their measure of social attention, the Social Attention Scale, was much more highly correlated with extraversion than were measures of reward sensitivity.|$|E
25|$|There was <b>excitement</b> <b>that</b> The Philadelphia Inquirer and the Philadelphia Daily News {{would be}} under local {{ownership}} {{for the first time}} since Walter Annenberg sold the paper to Knight Newspapers in 1969. The buyout was met with skepticism, however, among the employees at The Inquirer, who feared the new owners might threaten the editorial independence of the newspaper. Concerns were especially directed to Brian Tierney, who in the past had criticized Inquirer reporters for doing negative stories about his clients during his time at Tierney Communications. Tierney allayed fears by having the members of Philadelphia Media Holdings sign a pledge not to interfere with the paper's editorial independence. Tierney said he would combat The Inquirers decreasing revenue and circulation by spending millions on advertisements and promotions and not by laying off staff.|$|E

5000|$|Wyeth was {{a visual}} artist, {{primarily}} {{classified as a}} realist painter, like Winslow Homer or Eakins.

My God, when you really begin to peer into something, a simple object, and realize the profound meaning of that thing—if you have an emotion about it, there's no end." ...|$|R
25|$|However, Charlotte did {{not allow}} herself to be discouraged. Furthermore, {{coincidence}} came to her aid. One day in autumn 1845 while alone {{in the dining room}} she noticed a small notebook lying open on in the drawer of Emily's portable writing desk and of my sister Emily's handwriting. She read it and was dazzled by the beauty of the poems that she did not know. The discovery of this treasure was what she recalled five years later, and according to Juliet Barker, she erased the <b>excitement</b> <b>that</b> she had felt, more than surprise , a deep conviction that these were not common effusions, nor at all like the poetry women generally write. I thought them condensed and terse, vigorous and genuine. To my ear, they had a peculiar music – wild, melancholy, and elevating. In the following paragraph Charlotte describes her sister's indignant reaction at her having ventured into such an intimate realm with impunity. It took Emily hours to calm down and days to be convinced to publish the poems.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year, Johnny Baker {{returned as}} part of a larger crew to develop the previous gold finds and search for more. Gold was found on the east side of Yellowknife Bay in 1934 and the short-lived Burwash Mine was developed. When government geologists uncovered gold in more favourable geology on the west side of Yellowknife Bay in the fall of 1935, a small staking rush occurred. From 1935 to 1937, one prospector and trapper named Winslow C. Ranney staked in the area between David Lake and Rater Lake with few commercial results. The nearby hill known as Ranney Hill is his namesake and a popular hiking destination today. Although Con Mine was the most impressive gold deposit and its development created the <b>excitement</b> <b>that</b> led to the first settlement of Yellowknife in 1936–1937. Some of the first businesses were Corona Inn, Weaver & Devore Trading, Yellowknife Supplies and post office, and the Wildcat Cafe. Con Mine entered production on September 5, 1938. Yellowknife boomed in the summer of 1938 and many new businesses were established, including the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Hudson's Bay Company, Vic Ingraham's first hotel, Sutherland's Drug Store, and a pool hall.|$|E

Did it create that world? It absolutely did. That's not to say that we don't work increasingly hard to get everything right. But it's hard to get all the details right when it's a 21st century drama, never mind anything earlier.|$|E

The Verdis, along with Boito and Giulio Ricordi, attended together with King Umberto I and other major royal and political figures of the day.

60|$|But {{now that}} I resume {{the main line}} of my story it may be well to {{describe}} the personal appearance of my uncle as I remember him during those magnificent years that followed his passage from trade to finance. The little man plumped up very considerably during {{the creation of the}} Tono-Bungay property, but with the increasing <b>excitements</b> <b>that</b> followed that first flotation came dyspepsia and a certain flabbiness and falling away. His abdomen--if the reader will pardon my taking his features in the order of their value--had at first a nice full roundness, but afterwards it lost tone without, however, losing size. He always went as though he was proud of it and would make {{as much of it as}} possible. To the last his movements remained quick and sudden, his short firm legs, as he walked, seemed to twinkle rather than display the scissors-stride of common humanity, and he never seemed to have knees, but instead, a dispersed flexibility of limb.|$|R
