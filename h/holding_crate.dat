40|$|ABSTRACT Experiments were {{conducted}} to deter-mine 1) whether different crating durations influence stress responses and meat quality in broilers, and 2) whether <b>holding</b> <b>crated</b> broilers after transport in-fluences corticosterone (CORT) levels and meat quality. In a preliminary experiment, male broilers (n = 50) were held in crates (10 birds per crate) for either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 h prior to processing. Crating duration did not affect plasma CORT level, cooking loss, shear value of breast or thigh muscles, or carcass skin discolorations. Crating duration also {{did not affect the}} color (L*, a*, b*, chroma, and hue angle) of breast meat, but did change the color of thigh meat, with samples from the 3 h crating group having the highest hue values (P < 0. 01).

40|$|This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. This memo {{does not}} specify an Internet {{standard}} of any kind. Discussion {{and suggestions for}} improvement are requested. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. This RFC defines a new NCP protocol that is simple enough to be implemented on a very small computer, yet can be extended for efficient operation on large timesharing machines. Because worst case storage requirements can be predicted, a conservative implementation can be freed of complicated resource allocation and storage control procedures. A general error recovery procedure is also defined. Overview and Rational The central premise of this proposal is an insistence that all userto-user connections be bi-directional. For those familiar with communication theory, this appears most reasonable. All communication requires a cyclical flow of information. To deny a simple association between a message and its reply makes protocol unnecessarily complicated and turns simple mechanisms of flow control into nightmares. It is proposed that a bi-directional connection, or duplex link, be identified {{by a pair of}} socket numbers, one for each end. This is half the number presently required. Associated with the connection are some number of "crates " or message containers. These crates travel {{back and forth over the}} link carrying network messages from one side to the other. Buffers are allocated at each end of the link to <b>hold</b> <b>crates</b> and the messages that they carry. Worst case buffer requirements are equal to the number of crates in circulation, or the "capacity " of the link...|$|R

25|$|These {{manufacturers}} offer special {{models for}} fishing {{that are designed}} and accessorized for this sport, including specially designed hatches, built-in coolers & rod holders, gps receivers and equipment mounts. Other accessories include live wells, anchor trolleys and running lights. Specially designed fishing kayaks usually have designs {{similar to those of}} recreational sit-in and sit-on-top kayaks characterized by very wide beams (up to 36 inches) that increase lateral stability. The increases stability allows for the angler to stand up and fish on the kayak. These kayaks provide a considerable space for storage inside their hulls which allow the angler to stow rods, fishing gear, batteries for fish finders, extra paddles, anchors, and wheels to tow the kayak from vehicle to the water. The cutouts molded into the top of the kayaks are well-suited to <b>hold</b> milk <b>crates</b> with additional supplies. Some anglers equip their fishing kayaks with outriggers to further increase stability. In recent years people have begun using kayaks for fly fishing, most models suited for upright fly casting include upright braces that allow you to safely stand up.|$|R

50|$|Full-size <b>crates</b> <b>hold</b> 26 modules. Each module may {{dissipate}} up to 70 W, {{giving a}} total crate heat load of 1750 W. Modules require a −5.2 V supply for the ECL interface, usually a separate −2 V supply for ECL termination, {{and often a}} +5 V supply for TTL or CMOS logic. The FASTBUS standard also has +15 V and -15 V pins on the backplane, which are typically fed with very small power supplies as most modules use very little +/- 15 V (or any at all). Special high-capacity power supplies with large 15 V supplies {{would have to be}} used if modules drew large amounts of current on those rails. Crates typically have dedicated 200 A or 300 A switched-mode power supplies, providing current to the modules through multiple pins on the backplane connector. A large installation typically has multiple racks, each with three crates. Cooling and air handling are a significant issue, as is the safe design of high-current power distribution.|$|R
50|$|The Part-O-Matic is {{the only}} {{structure}} in the game controlled by you. It produces a set of parts, determined by the level, one by one. The speed {{is determined by the}} number of sheep on its wheel. Sheep are found randomly grazing and can be picked up by your crane and dropped on your Part-O-Matic's wheel. After an allotted amount of time, sheep will grow tired and need to be restored in the sheep dip found throughout the level, there is commonly one beside your main HQ. Once they have rested, they may be put back on the wheel. Black sheep are your sheep's enemy, as they will spread their disease to other sheep, rendering them useless. Once a sheep has been infected, you may put it in the green goo where it heals. However, once it turns completely black, {{there is no way to}} restore it to its previous state. In order to stop the sheep from getting infected at all is to kill the black sheep via boulder to the head. Sheep are fragile, and can be killed by your enemies or by accident. Sacrificing parts to your Part-O-Matic, such as enemy tank pieces, sheep, boulders, or crates, allows the Part-O-Matic to constantly reproduce from the pre-determined queue randomly set up in-game. Crates, as the main resource for you, are found all over the place and can be carried by your tanks and returned to your Part-O-Matic. One tank can <b>hold</b> 4 <b>crates</b> and sometimes crates can be difficult to get a hold of, so the default template is a lot of powerful weapons on a 4-exhaust engine placed on water-tracks.|$|R
2500|$|The queue {{contains}} several interactive features. In the “spike room”, {{the ceiling}} {{appears to be}} retained by several upright bamboo poles. When the key supporting pole is pushed, guests are startled by sounds of the ceiling dropping as the spikes begin to descend slowly toward them. In the next area, large stone blocks released from the ceiling (triggered by the diamond-shaped stones below) are barely kept in place by wooden wedges and supports. Further on, in the Rotunda Calendar, pulling on a rope triggers responses from Dr. Dunfor Pullit, an out-of-sight archeologist supported by the rope beneath the sarcophagus stone. Various crates throughout the queue contain some significant features; one marked with the number [...] "990 6753" [...] refers to {{the number on the}} <b>crate</b> <b>holding</b> the Ark of the Covenant in Raiders of the Lost Ark.

40|$|Carcass {{contamination}} during processing is {{an expensive}} problem for poultry processors. Feed withdrawal (FW) is commonly used {{to reduce the amount}} of gut contents prior to slaughter, thereby reducing the probability of contamination. The present study used market aged mixedsex broilers to evaluate the effect of FW time on the incidence of fecal spillage and contamination of broiler carcasses at processing. In order to develop a more simple research protocol for FW, the effects of live haul and <b>holding</b> in stationary <b>crates</b> were compared. Broilers were subjected to 1 of 4 FW times (4, 8, 12, and 16 h) prior to slaughter at a commercial processing plant, in which the incidence of carcass contamination was recorded. Carcass yield and clearance of contents from 8 gut sections were determined. Moisture content of the pooled gut contents was assessed. Shrink increased from 2. 1 to 3. 3 % of pre-FW BW after 4 and 16 h, respectively. Gut weights decreased significantly with every additional 4 h of FW. The incidence of processing plant inefficiencies decreased with increasing FW time. Gut moisture was not correlated with FW time, although moisture of the gut contents was reduced in birds subjected to live haul. Twelve hours of FW resulted in an optimal combination of gut clearance and carcass yield. Key words: broiler processing, feed withdrawal, food safety, carcass contamination, gut clearance, live hau...|$|R
500|$|Further {{problems}} were encountered with the gliders {{to be used}} in the operation, and the glider pilots themselves. Until a few months prior to the operation, there was a notable shortage of serviceable gliders in North Africa. In late March a small number of Wacos arrived at Accra on the Gold Coast, but pilots sent to ferry them to North Africa found that they were in poor condition. Due to neglect and the deleterious effects of tropical weather, the pilots were able to assemble only a small number of Wacos and fly them back on 22 April. On 23April, a larger number of the American gliders began to arrive in North African ports, but were not immediately available for use as the <b>crates</b> <b>holding</b> them were unloaded haphazardly, instructions were often found to be missing, and those men assigned to assemble the gliders were often inexperienced. However, when the decision was made to conduct a glider-borne assault with 1st Airlanding Brigade, assembly was improved, and by 12 June 346 gliders had been put together and delivered to the Troop Carrier Wings. A small number of Horsa gliders were transported to North Africa for use by the brigade. Thirty took off from England and undertook a trip of approximately [...] in Operation Turkey Buzzard. After attacks from Luftwaffe fighter patrols and experiencing often turbulent weather, a total of 27 Horsas were delivered to North Africa in time for the operation.|$|R
5000|$|In 1970, the Yale {{administration}} {{removed and}} crated the Tiffany window for storage in the Linsly-Chittenden basement for safekeeping, {{as part of}} a general strategy of securing vulnerable and valuable items on the Yale campus before the May Day protest on the New Haven Green that year. However, it was later discovered that the wrong windows had in fact been identified as the Tiffany window and removed and stored; it was the George Park Fisher Memorial Windows by Clayton and Bell, twelve large stained glass panels in the stairway to the library, each depicting a group of [...] "men of letters" [...] representing an epoch in literary history, which had been carefully packed for safekeeping in crates labelled [...] "Tiffany" [...] while the actual Tiffany window remained forgotten behind a dirty blackout curtain in a classroom {{on the other side of}} the building. The error was particularly striking in view of the Tiffany window having been widely identified as a single window, while the Clayton and Bell windows were twelve separate panels, which had to be individually removed and packed. Ironically, the failure to remove the correct window likely saved the Tiffany window for the university, as eleven of the twelve <b>crates</b> <b>holding</b> the other window but erroneously labeled as [...] "Tiffany" [...] vanished from the Linsly-Chittenden basement, either stolen or simply mislaid. In the meantime, the real Tiffany window has been cleaned and restored and is accompanied by a plaque identifying it.|$|R

Placing the right amount and sequence of lenses in the scope reveals a watchtower in Matia's harbor flashing a bulb under {{it in a way}} reminiscent of Morse code. All this forms one of two puzzles, required to have the guard flashing the bulb to raise a docking ring and let the Living Ship extend its main tentacle so that Matia's Zone is reachable. Back inside the control room, after this event, a separate control panel there is now usable. Zooming in reveals a circular ring-similar to those used to enter coordinates-with a small knob lever that turns to indicate the number of light flashes, twelve tiny knobs to indicate either [...] "-" [...] or [...] ".", and a button to play your Morse feedback signal, as flashes of neon green light. This is reminiscent of the Navy Signal lamp, in an automated design. However, attempting to repeat the code does nothing. At this point, an Argilan woman appears to explain what your task is, in her own native tongue, and fails. Angela Davies then ports in, explaining that your code must be in its [...] "negative" [...] form, both type and order. (from [...] "-" [...] to [...] "." [...] and vice versa) Finishing that results in access to Matia.|$|R
