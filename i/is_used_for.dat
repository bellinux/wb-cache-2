A square <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> his nose, and an egg-shaped oval <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> his eyes. The eye furthest from the screen is always drawn larger than the other. Povenmire uses a nine-step process to draw Ferb, starting with his head and ending with touch ups.|$|E

5|$|Greenlandic is an ergative language. This means that, {{instead of}} {{treating}} the grammatical relations {{as in most}} European languages where grammatical subjects are marked with nominative case and objects with accusative, the grammatical roles are defined differently. In Greenlandic the ergative case <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> agents of transitive verbs and for possessors. Absolutive case <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> patients of transitive verbs and subjects of intransitive verbs. Research into Greenlandic as used by the younger generation {{has shown that the}} use of ergative alignment in Kalaallisut may be becoming obsolete, converting the language into a nominative–accusative language.|$|E

It was designed with the Xbox 360 controller in mind; for example, the A button <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> selecting units. A single tap of the button selects one unit, while a double tap selects all units of the same type. The d-pad navigates to current battles and cycles through bases, while the right analog stick adjusts the camera angle. A radial menu <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> base construction.|$|E
