These {{types are}} humans {{born with a}} tail, and they can shape shift like a {{werewolf}} but they <b>have</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> their transformation. Their entire power is kept in their tail. In undeath, the pricolici remain in their wolf form.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{had not had}} any mechanical {{or technical}} errors or problems prior to take-off. The turbulence and wind shear caused a crack in either the tail rudder, the tailplane, or both. This was caused by strong winds acting {{on both sides of}} the structure, due to shifting winds. These structural failures caused the aircraft to crash. Out of the 63 seconds from take-off to impact, the aircraft was under control for the first 55 seconds; only during the last 8 seconds did the crew not <b>have</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Wider {{management}} failings {{were found}} by the investigation to {{have contributed to the}} explosion: management safety checks at the site were found to be deficient and not properly followed. Site staff did not <b>have</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> the flow rates and timing of two of the three inlet sources, meaning {{that they did not have}} enough information to properly manage the storage of incoming fuel. Further, overall throughput had increased, reducing wait times further and shifting the emphasis to process operations instead of process safety.|$|E

5|$|Belgrano {{tried to}} promote the {{diversification}} of agriculture via the production of linen and hemp, following experiences with his friend Martín de Altolaguirre. He proposed to keep reserves of wheat to help <b>have</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> its price. He also tried to make leather recognised {{as a product of}} the country, in order to promote its commercial potential. None of these proposals were accepted. He designed a system to give prizes to achievements that would boost the local economy, diversify the agriculture, or deforest the pampas. The system did not work as expected, and as nobody met the requirements no such prize was ever given.|$|E
5|$|However, {{despite their}} vulnerability, some women in rural Malawi {{believe that they}} do, to a certain extent, <b>have</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> their own health and well-being. They tell their husbands that the HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} has made sexual infidelity extremely dangerous {{and encourage them to}} refrain from engaging in extramarital sexual contact. In addition, many women are convinced that, by appealing to the vulnerability of their children (who will probably be orphaned if their parents contract HIV), they can convince their husbands to use condoms consistently during extramarital sexual encounters. Other women seek support from their friends and family members when they believe that their husbands' unsafe behaviors are putting their lives at risk. Finally, as a last resort, women might warn their husbands that they will visit the ankhoswe, or traditional marriage counselor, and demand divorce if their husbands refuse to remain faithful and actively prevent the transmission of the disease.|$|E
5|$|Matings are {{generally}} observed between March and May, {{but the most}} likely time of conception is April. Most mating {{takes place in the}} territories and during the day. Females <b>have</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> the copulation process, and males may have to keep mating with the same females. Females usually give birth to one young each year. Gestation lasts around 27 weeks, and pregnant females give birth between late September and November. Late births into January are sometimes observed. The altricial newborns rely on their mothers for warmth. For their first three weeks, young cling to their mothers when they go foraging. After this, the young remain in the roosts. By January, young are capable of sustained flight, and by February, March or April are fully weaned.|$|E

5|$|Priestley's friends, {{particularly}} other Rational Dissenters, {{urged him}} to publish a work on the injustices experienced by Dissenters; the result was his Essay on the First Principles of Government (1768). An early work of modern liberal political theory and Priestley's most thorough treatment of the subject, it—unusually for the time—distinguished political rights from civil rights with precision and argued for expansive civil rights. Priestley identified separate private and public spheres, contending {{that the government should}} only <b>have</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> the public sphere. Education and religion, in particular, he maintained, were matters of private conscience and should not be administered by the state. Priestley's later radicalism emerged from his belief that the British government was infringing upon these individual freedoms.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453, Mehmed {{set his sights on}} other campaigns. In Anatolia, the Greek Empire of Trebizond was still {{resisting}} the Ottomans, and to the East the White Sheep Turkomans of Uzun Hasan, together with other smaller states, threatened the Ottomans. In the West, Skanderbeg in Albania continued to trouble the Sultan, while Bosnia was sometimes reluctant in paying the Jizya (tax on non-Muslims). Wallachia controlled the left bank of the Danube, and Mehmed wanted to <b>have</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> the river, as naval attacks could be launched against his empire {{all the way from the}} Holy Roman Empire. On September 26, 1459, Pope Pius II called for a new crusade against the Ottomans and on January 14, 1460, at the Congress of Mantua, the Pope proclaimed the official crusade that was to last for three years. His plan, however, failed and the only European leader that showed enthusiasm for the crusade was Vlad Ţepeş, whom the Pope held in high regard. Because of a lack of enthusiasm shown by Europeans for the crusade, Mehmed took the opportunity to take an offensive stand. Later that same year (1460), he captured the last independent Serbian city, Smederevo, and in 1461, he convinced the Greek despot of Morea to give up his stronghold; soon thereafter, its capital, Mistra, and Corinth followed suit and surrendered themselves without struggle.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{a dispute}} between the Malays and the Bugis, the Johor-Riau Empire was split in 1819 with the {{mainland}} Johor Sultanate came {{under the control of}} Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim while the Riau-Lingga Sultanate came {{under the control of the}} Bugis. The Temenggong intended to create a new administration centre for the Johor Sultanate to create a dynasty under the entity of Temenggong. As the Temenggong already had a close relationship with the British and the British intended to <b>have</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> trade activities in Singapore, a treaty was signed between Sultan Ali and Temenggong Ibrahim in Singapore on 10 March 1855. According to the treaty, Ali would be crowned as the Sultan of Johor and receive $5,000 (in Spanish dollars) with an allowance of $500 per month. In return, Ali was required to cede the sovereignty of the territory of Johor (except Kesang of Muar which would be the only territory under his control) to Temenggong Ibrahim. When both sides agreed on Temenggong acquiring the territory, he renamed it Iskandar Puteri and began to administer it from Telok Blangah in Singapore.|$|E

Mana and Saya are rescued by Mana's comrades in SIRRUT, a covert group resisting Fumito's group who heard about Saya's past through Itsuki Tomofusa, a spy who died following the experiment. The group is led by Fumito's relative Kuroto Mogari, whose family was killed so Fumito could <b>have</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> the Shrovetide. Kuroto offers Saya SIRRUT's aid finding Fumito in exchange for her help. Hunted by Tower, and after saving Mana from Youth Ordinance Bill enforcers, Saya agrees to help.

When Saya attacks, it is revealed to be a trap baited with a false version of Fumito, and she must fight off an Elder Bairn before they can escape. In the aftermath, Mana reveals that her father disappeared after she helped him with his research into Tower. Regaining her confidence as a hacker, Mana locates Tower's main base, allowing Saya to infiltrate the base.|$|E
