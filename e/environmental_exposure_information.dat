40|$|Predictions of {{environmental}} concentrations of engineered nanomaterials (ENM) {{are needed for}} their environmental risk assessment. Because analytical data on ENM-concentrations in the environment are not yet available, exposure modeling represents {{the only source of}} information on ENM exposure in the environment. This work provides material flow data and environmental concentrations of nine ENM in Denmark. It represents the first study that distinguishes between photostable TiO 2 (as used in sunscreens) and photocatalytic TiO 2 (as used in self-cleaning surfaces). It also provides first exposure estimates for quantum dots, carbon black and CuCO 3. Other ENM that are covered are ZnO, Ag, CNT and CeO 2. The modeling is based for all ENM on probability distributions of production, use, environmental release and transfer between compartments, always considering the complete life-cycle of products containing the ENM. The magnitude of flows and concentrations of the various ENM depends on the one hand on the production volume but also on the type of products they are used in and the life-cycles of these products and their potential for release. The results reveal that in aquatic systems the highest concentrations are expected for carbon black and photostable TiO 2, followed by CuCO 3 (under the assumption that the use as wood preservative becomes important). In sludge-treated soil highest concentrations are expected for CeO 2 and TiO 2. Transformation during water treatments results in extremely low concentrations of ZnO and Ag in the environment. The results of this study provide valuable <b>environmental</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>information</b> for future risk assessments of these ENM...|$|E
40|$|Background: Petcoke is a remmant {{of the oil}} {{refining}} process that contains Ni and other heavy metals. Undesired human exposure to these compounds may result from petcoke combustion in plants located {{in the vicinity of}} the cities. Aim: To compare levels of urinary Ni in schoolchildren residing in cities exposed and not exposed to petcoke pollution. Material and methods: A cross sectional study was done in schoolchildren aged 7 to 8 years old in two cities in northern Chile: Mejillones (n = 59), near to a petcoke plant and Tocopilla (n = 56) as the reference city. First, morning urinary samples were collected and urinary Ni was determined by Atomic Absorption Spectrometry. Socioeconomic and <b>environmental</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>information</b> of families was obtained applying a questionnaire to parents. Multiple linear regression was performed to identify other variables that may explain urinary Ni differences among the cities. Results: Median level of Ni was higher in Mejillones (4. 9 mu g/L) than in Tocopilla (3. 9 mu g/L). Residing in the exposed city was the most important explaining factor (beta = 0. 26; IC 0. 107 - 0. 428). Additionally, years of residency was associated with urinary Ni (beta = 0. 03; IC 0. 004 - 0. 060). Conclusions: Urinary Ni in schoolchildren is higher in the city exposed to petcoke emissions. The difference does not imply that there are concrete hazards for the population's health. However, it warns about the existence of a higher exposure in places where petcoke is used...|$|E
40|$|Background/Objective: Despite {{potential}} benefits granted by genetically modified (GM) fruit trees, their release and commercialization raises concerns about their potential environmental impact, and the transfer via pollen of transgenes to cross-compatible cultivars is {{deemed to be}} the greatest source for <b>environmental</b> <b>exposure.</b> <b>Information</b> compiled from field trials on GM trees is essential to propose measures to minimize the transgene dispersal. We have conducted a field trial of seven consecutive years to investigate the maximum frequency of pollen-mediated crop-to-crop transgene flow in a citrus orchard, and its relation to the genetic, phenological and environmental factors involved. Methodology/Principal Findings: Three different citrus genotypes carrying the uidA (GUS) tracer marker gene (pollen donors) and a non-GM self-incompatible contiguous citrus genotype (recipient) were used in conditions allowing natural entomophilous pollination to occur. The examination of 603 to 2990 seeds per year showed unexpectedly low frequencies (0. 17 - 2. 86 %) of transgene flow. Paternity analyses of the progeny of subsets of recipient plants using 10 microsatellite (SSR) loci demonstrated a higher mating competence of trees from another non-GM pollen source population that greatly limited the mating chance of the contiguous cross-compatible and flowering-synchronized transgenic pollen source. This mating superiority could be explained by a much higher pollen competition capacity of the non-GM genotypes, as was confirmed through mixed-hand pollinations. Conclusions/Significance: Pollen competition strongly contributed to transgene confinement. Based on this finding, suitable isolation measures are proposed {{for the first time to}} prevent transgene outflow between contiguous plantings of citrus types that may be extendible to other entomophilous transgenic fruit tree species.

40|$|The {{impact of}} “place” on health is a {{classical}} and {{key element of}} epidemiology. Recent advances in geographic information systems have facilitated the use of spatial methods to investigate public health issues. Such approaches are particularly helpful when a public health phenomenon is relatively new and adequate <b>environmental</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>information</b> is lacking. The overarching objective of the present epidemiological investigation is to use spatial methods to explore relationships between several infant and children’s health outcomes and potential environmental exposures. The public health significance of this work is to identify possible sources of harmful exposures that may motivate further research, primary prevention efforts, and eventually policies to further limit exposures in these sensitive populations. It {{is well known that}} the embryo/fetus is particularly sensitive to the effects of environmental agents. Early life exposures are of public health significance since they may harm infant health and also have further adverse consequences in childhood and adulthood. The present work encompasses two relatively new but growing areas of interest related to fetal, infant, and children’s health: 1) unconventional natural gas development and adverse birth outcomes, and 2) sources of air toxics and childhood autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Geographic information systems are used to spatially link health outcomes, including birth weight, small for gestational age, preterm birth, and ASD, with nearby sources or with aggregated (e. g., census tract-level) estimates of exposure. Logistic regression is conducted to determine associations between risk for each of the above health effects and the exposures of interest, adjusting for other sociodemographic and personal risk factors. Overall, results indicate that environmental factors have a small but important role to play in the health of infants and children, even after accounting for other potentially confounding factors. Since spatial surrogates for exposure are the primary focus of this investigation, future work will benefit from improved individual exposure assessment and a prospective study design to confirm and further explain these associations...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES—The {{association}} between birth weight {{and exposure to}} benzene, work stress, and other occupational and environmental hazards was investigated.  METHODS—In a large petrochemical industry, 792  pregnant workers were enrolled and followed up through delivery between May 1996  and December 1998.  Exposure to benzene and other solvents was assessed by an industrial hygienist based on each woman's job title and workplace information. Other occupational and <b>environmental</b> <b>exposures</b> and personal <b>information,</b> including perceived work stress, exposure to noise, physical exertion at work, and passive smoking, were obtained by an interview questionnaire. Univariate and multivariate regression models were {{used to examine the}} individual and combined associations of occupational and <b>environmental</b> <b>exposures</b> with birth weight, with adjustment for major confounders including gestational age.  RESULTS—In the univariate model, birth weight was negatively associated with exposure to benzene (− 58 g (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI), − 115 to − 2)) and with work stress (− 84 g (95 % CI, − 158 to − 10)). In the multivariate model, there was a significant interaction between exposure to benzene and work stress relative to reduced birth weight, after adjustment for other <b>environmental</b> and occupational <b>exposures</b> and personal variables. Adjusted mean birth weight was 3445  g (95 % CI 3401  to 3489) among those with neither exposure, 3430  g for those with exposure to benzene only, 3426  g for those with work stress only, and 3262  g (95 % CI 3156  to 3369) for those with both exposures. In other words, there was 183  g (95 % CI 65  to 301) reduction in birth weight among those with both exposure to benzene and work stress compared with those with neither exposure. Other work or environmental factors could not explain these findings.  CONCLUSIONS—Low level exposure to benzene and work stress interact to reduce birth weight in this population.    Keywords: birth weight; benzene; work stres...|$|R

Obj e c t i v e: We examined the feasibility of conducting a local assessment of the public health impacts of cumulative air pollution reduction activities from federal, state, local, and voluntary actions in the City of New Haven, Connecticut (USA). Met h o d s: Using a hybrid modeling approach that combines regional and local-scale air quality data, we estimated ambient concentrations for multiple air pollutants [e. g., PM 2. 5 (particulate matter ≤ 2. 5 μm in aerodynamic diameter), NOx (nitrogen oxides) ] for baseline year 2001 and projected emissions for 2010, 2020, and 2030. We assessed the feasibility of detecting health improvements in relation to reductions in air pollution for 26 different pollutant–health outcome linkages using both sample size and exploratory epidemiological simulations to further inform decision-making needs.
