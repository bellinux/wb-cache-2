5|$|The Lemon {{test has}} been criticized by justices and legal scholars, but it remains the {{predominant}} {{means by which the}} Court enforces the <b>Establishment</b> <b>Clause.</b> In Agostini v. Felton (1997), the entanglement prong of the Lemon test was demoted to simply being a factor in determining the effect of the challenged statute or practice. In Zelman v. Simmons-Harris (2002), the opinion of the Court considered secular purpose and the absence of primary effect; a concurring opinion saw both cases as having treated entanglement as part of the primary purpose test. Further tests, such as the endorsement test and coercion test, have been developed to determine whether a government action violated the <b>Establishment</b> <b>Clause.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1940s, Black wrote {{decisions}} relating to the <b>establishment</b> <b>clause,</b> where he insisted on the strict {{separation of church and}} state.

5|$|Assuming for the {{purposes}} of argument, however, that evolution is a religion or religious tenet, the remedy is to stop the teaching of evolution, not establish another religion in opposition to it. Yet it is clearly established in the case law, and perhaps also in common sense, that evolution is not a religion and that teaching evolution does not violate the <b>Establishment</b> <b>Clause,</b> Epperson v. Arkansas, supra, Willoughby v. Stever, No. 15574-75 (D.D.C. May 18, 1973); aff'd. 504 F.2d 271 (D.C. Cir. 1974), cert. denied , 420 U.S. 924 (1975); Wright v. Houston Indep. School Dist., 366 F.

5|$|However, in the 1920s Christian fundamentalists in the United States {{developed}} their literalist arguments against modernist theology into {{opposition to the}} teaching of evolution, with fears that Darwinism had led to German militarism and was a threat to religion and morality. This opposition developed into the creation–evolution controversy involving Christian literalists in the United States objecting {{to the teaching of}} evolution in public schools. Although early objectors dismissed evolution as contradicting their interpretation of the Bible, this argument was legally invalidated when the Supreme Court ruled in Epperson v. Arkansas in 1968 that forbidding the teaching of evolution on religious grounds violated the <b>Establishment</b> <b>Clause.</b>|$|E

5|$|Two minor controversies marked Beshear's {{tenure as}} {{attorney}} general. The {{first came in}} the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in the 1980 case of Stone v. Graham. The ruling struck down the state law requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in all of the state's classrooms on grounds that it violated the <b>Establishment</b> <b>Clause</b> of the federal constitution. State Superintendent Raymond Barber asked the Supreme Court to clarify whether its ruling meant that all of the copies of the Commandments already posted had to be taken down or whether it simply invalidated the Kentucky requirement for them to be posted; the Court refused the request for clarification. Beshear then issued an advisory opinion that displaying the Commandments in classrooms under any circumstances was banned by the Court's ruling.|$|E
5|$|During the 2004 trial {{regarding}} {{allegations of}} Rush Limbaugh's drug abuse, the ACLU argued that his privacy {{should not have}} been compromised by allowing law enforcement examination of his medical records. In June 2004, the school district in Dover, Pennsylvania, required that its high school biology students listen to a statement which asserted that the theory of evolution is not fact and mentioning intelligent design as an alternative theory. Several parents called the ACLU to complain, because they believed that the school was promoting a religious idea in the classroom and violating the <b>Establishment</b> <b>Clause</b> of the First Amendment. The ACLU, joined by Americans United for Separation of Church and State, represented the parents in a lawsuit against the school district. After a lengthy trial, Judge John E. Jones III ruled in favor of the parents in the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District decision, finding that intelligent design is not science and permanently forbidding the Dover school system from teaching intelligent design in science classes.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} holding of the Court {{found that the}} crèche display violated the <b>Establishment</b> <b>Clause</b> while the menorah did not. In her opinion, Justice O'Connor explained the slightly different reasons why she also supports Justice Blackmun's holding. Justice Brennan, joined by Justices Stevens and Marshall, joined parts III-A, IV, and V of Blackmun's opinion. However, Brennan disagreed with Blackmun and O'Connor's respective opinions by stating that the menorah and Christmas tree are also violations of the <b>Establishment</b> <b>Clause.</b> Justice Kennedy, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices White and Scalia, disagreed with Blackmun's reasoning in part VI and agreed with the previous judgment of the district court. Justice Stevens, in his own opinion, stated that the appeals court was correct in its ruling. He believed that the menorah display, together with the Christmas tree, signified a double violation of the <b>establishment</b> <b>clause.</b> Since the menorah is a religious symbol, he felt that Judaism and Christianity were being endorsed {{by the government to}} the exclusion of all other religions.|$|E

40|$|This article {{argues that}} {{perpetrators}} {{of sexual misconduct}} should not be granted refuge from the potential {{consequences of their actions}} by mere affiliation with a religious institution. Part I of this article examines the theories of malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty, and determines the appropriate cause of action for sexual misconduct and ascertains their capacities to withstand First Amendment scrutiny. Determining the cause of action is essential to the evaluation of the potential constitutional challenges. Part II demonstrates that sexual misconduct by clergy is well outside First Amendment constraints. It examines both the Free Exercise and <b>Establishment</b> <b>Clauses,</b> and evaluates the approaches of courts to the situation of clergy sexual misconduct. Part II then compares the judicial treatment of sexual harassment by clergy under Title VII as guidance for treatment of sexual misconduct by clergy. This Part also discusses a general theory of state intervention in the affairs of religious organizations. This article concludes with an application of the appropriate cause of action under tort law within First Amendment constraints...|$|R
5000|$|An outspoken liberal {{throughout}} his career, {{he played a}} leading role in the Warren Court's expansion of individual rights. Brennan played a behind-the-scenes role during the Warren Court, coaxing more conservative colleagues to join the Court's decisions. Brennan's opinions with respect to voting (Baker v. Carr), criminal proceedings (Malloy v. Hogan), the free speech and <b>establishment</b> <b>clauses</b> of the First Amendment (Roth v. United States), and civil rights (Green v. County School Board of New Kent County) were some of the most important opinions of the Warren Era. Brennan's role in expanding free speech rights under the First Amendment is particularly notable, as he wrote the Court's opinion in 1964's New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, which created constitutional restrictions on the law of libel. It was Brennan who coined the phrase [...] "chilling effect", in 1965's Dombrowski v. Pfister. His close friendship with Chief Justice Warren, who frequently assigned Brennan the task of writing the majority opinion, led to the other justices nicknaming him the [...] "deputy Chief".|$|R
25|$|Having {{no further}} {{recourse}} in the University of Virginia, Wide Awake magazine and Rosenberger asked the legal {{help of the}} Center for Individual Rights, which {{filed a lawsuit against}} the UVA, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia, who granted summary judgment to the University, ruling that denying student activities funding to Wide Awake was neither unconstitutional content-based discrimination, nor unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination, and that the University's interest in avoiding violating the <b>Establishment</b> <b>Clause</b> justified not subsidizing the magazine. Yet, the district court did not conclusively rule upon the related {{question of whether or not}} the UVA subsidizing the student religious magazine would violate the <b>Establishment</b> <b>Clause</b> of the U.S. Constitution. Wide Awake appealed its lost case to the Fourth Circuit court, which ruled that the University had engaged in unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination, but that the University’s subsidizing the religious magazine would affirmatively violate the <b>Establishment</b> <b>Clause.</b> Wide Awake then appealed the Fourth Circuit Court’s decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to review the case.|$|E

5000|$|New Jersey's Kosher laws {{being found}} {{to violate the}} <b>Establishment</b> <b>clauses</b> of both the New Jersey state {{constitution}} and the First Amendment. The opinion was affirmed by the New Jersey Supreme Court in which it found that the State's use of [...] "Orthodox Jewish law" [...] {{as a basis for}} the definition of kosher was an adoption of substantive religious standards which violated the State and Federal constitutions. [...] The State's response was to create a new law which avoids any definition of a what is or is not kosher. Instead, establishments which claim to be kosher must provide details about what they mean by kosher, and the State will check to ensure that this standard is adhered to. For example, kosher restaurants must display a poster (provided by the Kosher Food Enforcement Bureau) on which they display the name of their rabbinic certifier, how often he inspects the place, whether or not he requires all ingredients to be kosher-supervised, and so on. In this manner, government enforcement becomes a consumer-protection issue, and avoids the problems of advancing any particular religious view.|$|R
40|$|When {{should we}} {{accommodate}} religious practices? When should we demand that religious groups instead conform {{to social and}} legal norms? Who should make these decisions, and how? These questions lie {{at the very heart}} of our contemporary debates in the field of Law and Religion. Particularly thorny issues arise where religious practices may impose health-related harm to children within a religious group or to third parties. Unfortunately, legislators, scholars, courts, ethicists, and medical practitioners have not offered a consistent way to analyze such cases and the law is inconsistent. This Article suggests that the lack of consistency is a troubling artifact of our political system, and further, that it raises serious constitutional questions that lie at the intersection of the Free Exercise and <b>Establishment</b> <b>clauses</b> of the First Amendment. To resolve these problems, we propose and develop a test to determine whether such a religious practice should be accommodated by legislators, courts, and medical practitioners. Our test is sensitive to the institutional strengths and weaknesses of differently-situated decision-makers, and is designed to be flexible enough to account for these differences. Consequently, it has distinctive applications for legislators, administrative officials, judges, and medical practitioners. Further, although the test was developed specifically to address religious practices that may impose health-related harms to children and third-parties, it also has potential implications in other contexts as well, such as the debates over sexual orientation non-discrimination laws should accommodate religious dissent...|$|R
40|$|The {{national}} {{same-sex marriage}} {{debate has been}} dominated {{for the past decade}} by the interstate recognition issue. This article seeks to shift the focus of the debate to same-sex marriage prohibitions themselves and their incompatibility with several limitations of federal constitutional law. After showing the legal irrelevance of the Defense of Marriage Act to the interstate recognition issue, the article addresses the proper resolution of that choice-of-law issue through the lens of a well-known New York Court of Appeals decision. In that case, despite New York 2 ̆ 7 s ban on uncle-niece marriage, the New York high court - {{one of the most respected}} state supreme courts over the years in choice-of-law matters - applied Rhode Island law to uphold the validity of an uncle-niece marriage in Rhode Island between two New Yorkers. On its face, the case appears to offer powerful support for recognizing an out-of-state same-sex marriage that is valid where formed, but as the article demonstrates, the court 2 ̆ 7 s choice of law is so difficult to defend that it actually militates against interstate recognition of same-sex marriage. However, as the article 2 ̆ 7 s juxtaposition of the uncle-niece and same-sex marriage recognition issues highlights, same-sex marriage recognition is not simply a matter of choice of law. While the Constitution leaves states free to allow or ban uncle-niece marriage, states do not have such latitude in legislating about same-sex marriage. The article maintains that prohibitions on same-sex marriage violate the Due Process, Equal Protection, and <b>Establishment</b> <b>Clauses...</b>|$|R

40|$|My goal in {{this piece}} is to surface some of the commonalities between {{religious}} belief liberty and sexual orientation identity liberty and to offer some public policy suggestions for {{what to do when}} these liberties conflict. I first want to make transparent the conflict that I believe exists between laws intended to protect the liberty of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (2 ̆ 2 LGBT 2 ̆ 2) people so that they may live lives of dignity and integrity and the religious beliefs of some individuals whose conduct is regulated by such laws. I believe those who advocate for LGBT equality have downplayed the impact of such laws on some people 2 ̆ 7 s religious beliefs and, equally, I believe those who have sought religious exemptions from such civil rights laws have downplayed the impact that such exemptions would have on LGBT people. Second, I want to suggest that the best framework for dealing with the conflict between some people 2 ̆ 7 s religious beliefs and LGBT people 2 ̆ 7 s identity liberty is to analyze religious people 2 ̆ 7 s claims as belief liberty interests under the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, rather than as free exercise claims under the First Amendment. There were important historical reasons for including the First Amendment in our Constitution, with its dual Free Exercise and <b>Establishment</b> <b>Clauses.</b> But the First Amendment need not be understood as the sole source of protection for religious people when the claims they raise also implicate the type of liberty interests that can legitimately be considered under the Due Process Clauses of our Constitution...|$|R
