"The Bells of Saint John" [...] was {{designed}} to be an [...] "urban thriller", in that it is taking [...] "something omnipresent <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> making it sinister". It was watched by 8.44million viewers in the UK. The episode received generally positive reviews, although several critics felt that the plot and threat were lacking.|$|E
500|$|... "Until It Beats No More" [...] {{speaks of}} a love that never dies. According to Lopez, it is about when you are at a bad bad point <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> {{somebody}} comes in and makes you believe in love again. She cited her then-husband Marc Anthony as being that person for her. Monica Herrera of Billboard picked up on this, with the lyrics: [...] "I feel the beat again, stronger than before". Scott Shetler of PopCrush pointed out the song's optimistic viewpoint, with the lyrics: [...] "I'm alive, I can breathe, I can feel, I believe." ...|$|E
500|$|... 'Judas' is {{a metaphor}} and an analogy about {{forgiveness}} and betrayal and things that haunt you <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> how I believe that it's the darkness {{in your life that}} ultimately shines and illuminates the greater light that you have upon you. Someone once said to me, 'If you have no shadows then you're not standing in the light.' So the song is about washing the feet of both good and evil and understanding and forgiving the demons from your past in order to move into the greatness of your future. I just like really aggressive metaphors—harder, thicker, darker—and my fans do as well. So it is a very challenging and aggressive metaphor, but it {{is a metaphor}}.|$|E

500|$|Writer Steven Moffat {{described}} the premise as the traditional 'Doctor Who' thing of taking something omnipresent <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> making it sinister, if something did {{get in the}} Wi-Fi, we'd be kind of screwed. Nobody had really done it before, so I thought, 'It's time to get kids frightened of Wi-Fi!' [...] However, he denied that his intention was to give a warning about technology, but rather tell an adventure story about a [...] "new way [...] to invade" [...] based on something viewers were familiar with. Producer Marus Wilson suggested that the episode be an [...] "urban thriller", as the story would already be set in contemporary London to introduce Clara and the Wi-Fi monsters. Moffat compared the style to James Bond and The Bourne Identity. Moffat said that the episode was [...] "an action roller coaster" [...] rather than a story intended to be scary.|$|E
2500|$|The album's [...] "most startling" [...] {{song was}} {{considered}} [...] "What About," [...] in which Jackson violently confronts domestic abuse. Jackson stated, [...] "I think it's important to let others know that {{certain things that}} you may have experienced <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>life,</b> <b>and</b> that they're not alone, and that you understand what they're going through, and that they can make it through." [...] Joel Lyans included it among [...] "The New Soundtrack of Social Consciousness," [...] writing, [...] "Here, Janet does what she does best: demonstrates a coy and shy demeanor before ripping into a confident and empowered voice for those who are afraid to speak up and speak out about a situation that plagues millions of women." [...] Several media reports related its theme with President Bill Clinton's infidelity to Hillary Clinton with Monica Lewinsky. Jackson clarified it to be about her own experience, saying, [...] "President Clinton? People have said that to me. They say 'this is his song'," [...] comparing the situation with her song [...] "This Time" [...] inaccurately related to O.J. Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson due to its subject matter.|$|E

5000|$|The track, [...] "Chamber of Reflection", {{references}} a freemasonry concept, which DeMarco subsequently {{likened to}} his home studio: [...] "It's a room people go into before you're initiated into freemasonry. It's like a meditation room, and they lock you in there {{for a period of}} time. The purpose is to reflect on what you've done <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>life</b> already <b>and</b> move on from it. I think that's what I did in home studio right here. It was actually therapeutic. I feel a little enlightened, a little less heavy. It's tight.".
