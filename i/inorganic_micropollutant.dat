40|$|Traditional {{precipitation}} {{methods for}} <b>inorganic</b> <b>micropollutant</b> removal from waters {{are increasingly being}} replaced by sorption methods based on both natural and synthetic materials. In this context, two novel effective heavy metal ions absorbers are presented. These resins, LYMA and LMT 85, were crosslinked poly(amidoamine) s carrying amine and carboxyl groups in their repeating units. In particular, the LYMA-repeating unit contains one carboxyl and two amine groups and is a mimic of L-lysine, whereas LMT 85 contains two amine and five carboxyl groups and is a mimic of EDTA. Both resins were prepared at moderate cost by simple eco-friendly procedures. The heavy metal ion set adopted as benchmark was Cu 2 +, Cd 2 +, Pb 2 +, Zn 2 +, Ni 2 +, and Co 2 +. LYMA proved selective for Cu 2 + and Ni 2 +, the other ions tested being negligibly absorbed, whereas LMT 85 proved capable of rapidly and quantitatively absorbing all the ions tested either singly or in mixed solution. The absorption process was reversible, and the resins were easily regenerated by acidification. The absorption of several metal ions imparted intense coloring to the resins, a feature possibly exploitable for analytical purposes. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDredging rivers {{is needed}} to ensure safe navigable waters, rivers and waterways. To {{anticipate}} the management ofdredged materials {{in the case of}} the river Seine basin, the quality of the sediments in the river is checked every 3 years before dredging operations. The river Seine Basin is heavily submitted to pollution pressure from nearbyindustrial activities and urban expansion of Paris and its region. Here, the micropollutant content of the sedimentsampled in 1996, 1999 and 2000 before dredging is discussed compared to regulatory standards. The results indicatethat most of the sediment samples from the river Seine basin are lightly to moderately contaminated with organicand <b>inorganic</b> <b>micropollutants</b> (heavy metals, PAH, PCB), which makes the management after dredging easier. Thispollution is strongly correlated with the organic matter content and to the fine fraction (- 50 mm) of the sediment. These results can lead to other management options than the ones already used in the river Seine basin: (1) dumpingof lightly to moderately polluted sediments in quarries; and (2) physical treatment (sieving, hydrocycloning) ofcontaminated sediments issued from ‘hot spots’...|$|R
30|$|The rise of {{industrialization}} {{has been of}} great economic benefit around the world, but unfortunately, it has come with a firm price. Reckless and unchecked growth has resulted in detrimental consequences where we increasingly find our natural resources being polluted to levels beyond imaginable. Water being the elixir of life; its contamination is of particular concern. The hydrosphere is being increasingly contaminated by growing levels of organic and inorganic industrial effluents including heavy metals such as chromium and copper, waste acids and bases, phenols and oils. A significant number of the effluents found in wastewater cannot be degraded nor destroyed. While a number of techniques such as evaporation, ion–ion exchange, reverse osmosis, membrane-based solvent extraction, destruction by catalytic wet air oxidation (Bhargava et al. 2006), photocatalytic oxidation, membrane pervaporation, (Kondo and Sato 1994) precipitation have been devised {{for the treatment of}} wastewater, the disadvantages allied with these methods cannot be ignored. Adsorption, on the other hand, has been considered a comparatively efficient method and has been used extensively for the removal of organic and <b>inorganic</b> <b>micropollutants</b> from wastewater.|$|R
40|$|Exposure {{characterization}} is {{a central}} step in Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA). Exposure level {{is a function of}} the spatial factors linking contaminants and receptors, yet exposure estimation models are traditionally non-spatial. Non-spatial models are prone to the adverse effects of spatial dependence: inflated variance and biased inferential procedures, which can result in unreliable and potentially misleading models. Such negative effects can be amended by spatial regression modelling: we propose an integration of geostatistics and multivariate spatial regression to compute efficient spatial regression parameters and to characterize exposure at under-sampled locations. The method is applied to estimate bioaccumulation models of organic and <b>inorganic</b> <b>micropollutants</b> in the tissues of the clam Tapes philipinarum. The models link bioaccumulation of micropollutants in clam tissue to a set of environmental variables sampled in the lagoon sediment. The Venetian lagoon case study exemplifies the problem of multiple variables sampled at different locations or spatial units: we propose and test an effective solution to this common and serious problem in environmental as well as socio-economic multivariate analysis...|$|R

40|$|It is {{proposed}} that wastewater treatment facilities meet legislated discharge limits {{for a range}} of micropollutants. However, the heterogeneity of these micropollutants in wastewaters make removal difficult to predict since their chemistry is so diverse. In this study, a range of organic and <b>inorganic</b> <b>micropollutants</b> known to be preferentially removed via different mechanisms were selected to challenge the activated sludge process (ASP) and determine its potential to achieve simultaneous micropollutant removal. At a fixed hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 8 h, the influence of an increase in solids retention time (SRT) on removal was evaluated. Maximum achievable micropollutant removal was recorded for all chemicals (estrogens, nonylphenolics and metals) at the highest SRT studied (27 days). Also, optimisation of HRT by extension to 24 h further augmented organic biodegradation. Most notable was the enhancement in removal of the considerably recalcitrant synthetic estrogen 17 a-ethinylestradiol which increased to 65 analysis indicates that this enhanced micropollutant behaviour is ostensibly related to the concomitant reduction in food: microorganism ratio. Interestingly, extended HRT also initiated nonylphenol biodegradation which has not been consistently observed previously in real wastewaters. However, extending HRT increased the solubilisation of particulate bound metals, increasing effluent aqueous metals concentrations (i. e., 0. 45 ± 19 %. Regressionmm filtered) by > compliance. Consequently, identification of an optimum process condition for generic micropollutant removal is expected to favour a more integrated approach where upstream process unit optimisation (i. e., primary sedimentation) is demanded to reduce loading of the particle bound metal phase onto the ASP, thereby enabling longer HRT in the ASP to be considered for optimum removal of organic micropollutants. 100 %. This is significant as only the aqueous metal phase is to be considered for environmenta...|$|R
40|$|Changes in {{regulations}} {{and development of}} new technologies have affected the selection of alternative for treated wastewater disinfection. Disinfection is the last barrier of wastewater reclamation process to protect ecosystem safety and human health. Driving forces include water scarcity and drinking water supply, irrigation, rapid industrialization, using reclaimed water, source protection, overpopulation, and environmental protection. The safe operation of water reuse depends on effluent disinfection. Understanding the differences in inactivation mechanisms is critical to identify rate-limiting steps involved in the inactivation process {{as well as to}} develop more effective disinfection strategies. Disinfection byproducts discharged from wastewater treatment plants may impair aquatic ecosystems and downstream drinking-water quality. Numerous <b>inorganic</b> and organic <b>micropollutants</b> can undergo reactions with disinfectants. Therefore, to mitigate the adverse effects and also to enhance that efficiency, the use of alternative oxidation/disinfection systems should be evaluated as possible alternative to chlorine. This review gives a summary of the traditional, innovative, and combined disinfection alternatives and also disinfection byproducts for effluent of municipal wastewater treatment plants...|$|R
40|$|As {{the area}} of the Slovak Republic is 49, 036 km², there are many {{potential}} contaminants that can affect its population. In the socialist era the town of Strážske located in the Košice Municipal Region was the centre of production of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) inter alia and nowadays about 3, 500 metric tonnes of PCB are persisting there and present the greatest PCB environmental risk in the central Europe. The heavy metal contamination in Slovakia is caused by the natural background {{as well as by the}} former mining activities. In Slovakia there are about 17 thousand old mining works, i. e. adits, stocks, and impoundments. Contamination of the ground and surface waters in the Spiš–Gemer Ore Mountain (SGOM) area is caused by mine drainage. Arsenic, antimony, copper, mercury, cadmium, and zinc are the main pollutants of natural waters. All contaminated areas are currently monitored according to the national and EU legislation and nutrient load reduction programmes. As a result of this the level of <b>inorganic</b> and organic <b>micropollutants</b> in surface water and water reservoirs will be reduced together with the negative impact of water pollution on the environment in Eastern Slovakia region...|$|R
40|$|First {{available}} data on atmospheric fall-out {{were provided by}} sampling monthly bulk depositions in four sites inside the Lagoon of Venice (550 km 2). Sampling was carried out monthly during the period July 1998 – July 1999, in one site near an industrial area (Porto Marghera; site D), another site {{in the city of}} Venice (site A), and the remaining two in the southern- and northernmost ends of the Lagoon (Valle Figheri, site C; Valle Dogà site B). The following determinations were carried out for each samples: pH, conductivity, grain-size, particulate load, and dissolved nutrients (N, P). Samples were then subdivided into soluble and insoluble fractions, and Al, Ca, Na, K, Mg, Si, Mn, Fe, Zn, Ni, Cr, Cu, Pb, Cd, As, Hg, Ti, V, S, P, Se and Sb were analysed on both fractions. Total organic micropollutants (PAH, PCB, HCB, DDT, PCDD/F) were measured. As regards particle size distribution, there was great variability among sampling sites. The percentage of the < 2 µm grain-size fraction was higher in the southern and northern ends of the Lagoon. Small differences were found among sites for major elements, whereas higher variability was observed for <b>inorganic</b> and organic <b>micropollutants,</b> with standard deviations between 20 and 60...|$|R
