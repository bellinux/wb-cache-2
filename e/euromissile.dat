40|$|From the <b>Euromissiles</b> "Battle" to the Kosovo "War": the Atlantic Alliance and its Challenges (1979 - 1999), by Frédéric Bozo Despite {{the many}} {{challenges}} {{which it has}} had to face in the past 20 years, the Atlantic Alliance is today Consolidated. Be it {{the revival of the}} Cold War {{against the backdrop of the}} <b>euromissiles</b> battle and the invasion of Afghanistan; be it the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the East-West confrontation, which raised the question of NATO's continued existence; be it the conflict in ex-Yugoslavia and its aftermath, until the recent Kosovo crisis, the Alliance has successfully overcome all these trials. However, this positive record must be qualified: was it not first and foremost to ensure its own survival that NATO took up these challenges?The Building of Europe (1979 - 1999), by Robert Toulemon The last 20 years fit neatly between the implementation of the EMS in March 1979 and the entry into force of the euro on January 1, 1999. The fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989 eut this period into two and marked a caesura in European history. However, that décisive event ― which eased progress towards economie and monetary union — has not allowed genuine progress towards political union, nor have the crises in ex-Yugoslavia. The future of Europe remains uncertain at the end of this century. Toulemon. La construction de l'Europe (1979 - 1999). In: Politique étrangère, n° 3 - 1999 - 64 ᵉannée. pp. 573 - 585...|$|R
25|$|During {{operations}} in the Nahr el-Bared camp in North Lebanon, lacking any airworthy, fixed-wing strike aircraft, the Lebanese Army modified several UH-1H Huey helicopters to permit the carrying of 500pound Mark 82 and 1000pound Mark 83 bombs (all unguided iron bombs, also known as dumb bombs) as well as Matra SNEB 68mm rocket pods (taken from stored Hawker Hunters). Special mounting pads engineered by the Lebanese Army were attached to each Huey on the sides and belly to carry the bombs. The air force, {{in collaboration with the}} engineering regiment, developed and used two dumb bomb variants, the 250kg LAF-GS-ER2 and the 400kg LAF-GS-ER3. Usually, helicopters cannot bomb using this method, in comparison to ground attack aircraft, so this became one of the rare moments in history during which helicopters were used in such a way. The Lebanese Army also made extensive use of Aérospatiale Gazelles armed with <b>Euromissile</b> HOT anti-tank guided missiles and machine gun pods.|$|E
2500|$|A single {{airframe}} (Construction Number 1012, registration F-WZAK). {{was modified}} by Aérospatiale from standard SA 360C configuration {{to develop a}} version optimised for hot-and-high conditions, designated SA 360H. The main differences were {{the use of a}} 1,040kW (1,400hp) Astazou XXB engine and the Starflex rotorhead that had been developed for the Ecureuil. Deciding that the main customers for this more powerful aircraft were likely to be military ones, the aircraft was further modified and re-designated SA 360HCL (Helicoptere de Combat Leger – [...] "Light Combat Helicopter"). [...] It was fitted with a SFIM APX M397 roof-mounted, gyro-stabilised sight, and a nose-mounted sensor package incorporating a SFIM Vénus night-vision system and TRT Hector thermal-vision system. Armament consisted of eight launcher tubes for <b>Euromissile</b> HOT missiles, with options to carry most of the armament packages used by the Gazelle. So equipped, it could carry thirteen combat-ready troops into battle, or be used in the area neutralisation or anti-tank role. This aircraft was taken on by the Armée de Terre for evaluation, but no production order ensued.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} Italy and the intra-alliance {{dynamics}} developed by Italy around the adoption {{and implementation of}} the dual-track decision of December 1979. In particular, it describes how, starting from a marginal position, sanctioned by the exclusion of the Italian government from the quadripartite summit held at Guadeloupe in January 1979, Rome managed to heighten its political relevance as an Atlantic partner thanks to its status as a non-nuclear weapon state. In fact, in accepting to deploy the so-called <b>Euromissiles</b> on its territory, Italy not only guaranteed the necessary conditions for West Germany’s accession to that NATO decision; it also actively participated in Western European efforts to overcome the American initial resistance to pursue the arms control track with the same determination devoted to the nuclear build-up...|$|R
40|$|The article {{discusses}} the European dimension of antinuclear protests in Europe during the Cold War. In conceptual terms, explanations of peace movement mobilisation {{during the early}} 1980 s as result of a value change to post-materialist values are criticised. Contrary to this interpretation, peace activists, in particular women’s peace protests, stressed the material shortcomings they faced as a results of expenditure on nuclear armaments. In terms of their European character, antinuclear activists during the first mobilisation wave until 1963 developed substantial transnational contacts, but kept an orientation towards their nation as an identity space. During the campaign against the <b>Euromissiles</b> in the early 1980 s, an increasingly dense network of elective affinities according to – for instance – denomination or professional expertise emerged. Attempts to connect peace activists {{on both sides of}} the Iron Curtain in a ›détente from below‹, however, eere hampered by practical problems and divergent perceptions of the political situation. Even while movement activists interacted and coordinated their efforts across national borders, they did not simply merge into a European civil society. Antinuclear peace movement activists, the article argues, did not constitute a European subject...|$|R
40|$|Between 1981 and 1983, the {{mobilization}} against <b>Euromissiles</b> introduced an extraordinary novelty in Italian {{social and political}} history. The Italian anti-nuclear movement took off later than in other European countries and its main feature was a politicization unknown elsewhere. The movement developed {{on the basis of}} a double and contrary youth mobilization: the first coming from the Communists and the second from the New Left. The movement was not only manifold, but also radically divided about its goals (balanced disarmament vs. unilateralism, atomic weapons vs. nuclear energy, nuclear issue vs. military budget) and methods of protests (pleas vs. conscientious objections, mass demonstrations vs. civil disobedience, referendums vs. tax objections). Continuous disagreements conditioned and weakened the anti-nuclear movement, even when the axis of the protest was transferred to Comiso, to which and from which the PCI and the Radical Party promoted different and contrary marches. Even when, in 1983, a unanimous framework was approved, a common mobilization remained difficult, both in Comiso and in Rome. The movement was only a vast, heterogeneous and divergent coalition, but it expressed a common political base and culture. Neither Communist nor pacifist, but influenced by the New Left protest against traditional political parties, the new culture was rooted in environmentalism, pessimism, nuclear catastrophism, anti-Americanism, new socialism, disarmed unilateralism, and an opposition to everything that resembled traditional politics. The movement worried the Italian government, but it never represented a real political danger and never even succeeded in bringing the nuclear issue to the foreground. Nonetheless, it deeply changed the Italian political culture: it brought new styles and sensibilities, unknown to the traditional left. For the first time, criticisms of ideologies and parties, direct action, civil disobedience and individualism split Christian Democratics from their Catholic grassroots and Communists from the youth...|$|R

Piers Ludlow, Kiran Klaus Patel, Antonio Costa Pinto, Matthias Schulz, Giles Scott-Smith, Angela Romano, Federico Romero, Nuno Severiano Teixeira, Marten van Heuven, Kenneth Weisbrode, and Christian Wenkel. This unique collection of essays lays {{the groundwork for the}} study of the intersection of European integration and transatlantic relations in the 1980 s. With archives for this period only recently opened, scholars are beginning to analyse and understand what some have called an apogee of the European project and others have called the Second Cold War. How do these moments intersect and relate to one another? These essays, by prominent scholars from Europe and the United States, examine this and related questions while challenging conventional chronologies. The editors are grateful to them and to the EUI’s Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies, which sponsored the conference; to the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences of Maastricht University for its support. 1.

50|$|MILAN is a French / German missile {{created by}} <b>Euromissile.</b> Because it {{is guided by}} wire by an operator, this missile can avoid most {{countermeasures}} (flares, chaff and radio jammers).

5000|$|However, {{the attacks}} {{came to a}} halt and the Iranians turned to {{defensive}} measures.

HJ-8 is a tube-launched, optically tracked and wire-guided missile system armed with a HEAT anti-tank warhead. The HJ-8 is a combination many experts believe of three Western antitank missile systems obtained from nations in the Middle East and Asia that were then examined and reverse engineered and modified: the tripod from the US BGM-71 TOW; the tracker-control unit from the French/German MILAN; and the missile from the UK Swingfire.|$|E
