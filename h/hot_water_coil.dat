50|$|A {{convection}} heater is a heater which operates by air convection currents circulating {{through the body}} of the appliance, and across its heating element. This heats up the air, causing it to increase in volume and so become buoyant and rise. Oil heaters are an example of this kind of heating appliance. A {{convection heater}} may have an electrical heater element, a <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>coil,</b> or a steam coil. Because of the natural ventilation, they are quieter in operation than fan heaters.|$|E
50|$|The New York Times Company {{utilizes}} the underfloor {{air distribution}} system which strives for better indoor air quality, thermal comfort as well as energy saving. The conditioned air from the air handler is delivered through an air highway system that circumnavigates the service core {{and then into the}} six zoned off underfloor low pressure zones for distribution across the floor plate to all floor diffusers. Around each perimeter a series of fan power boxes control the temperature in the space. If heating is required then the fans turn on delivering heat via a <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>coil.</b> In cooling mode, the fans operate to give increased ventilation around the perimeter spaces. Fresh air is supplied by two air handling units on the 28th floor sending fresh treated outside air to each floor where a constant volume VAV controls the amount of air entering the system. The air is then conditioned for proper cooling and humidity before being sent to the air highway. The New York Times Building also benefits from other general UFAD advantages. In the open plan office space that was implemented in occupied space from 2nd to 21st floors to enhance daylighting and outdoor views, the system provides flexibility to place the required equipment anywhere on the raised integrated service plenum. When departments or occupants needed to be reconfigured, the raised floor also enables maintenance to carry out changes at relatively lower expense.|$|E

40|$|Proportional and {{integral}} (PI) control, {{which is}} designed for a linear control system, is {{the most widely used}} control in HVAC systems. However, HVAC systems are nonlinear systems. Many efforts are made to tune the PI control loop. In practice, a lot of PI loops are still poorly tuned. A poorly-tuned loop affects indoor comfort, wastes energy, and increases maintenance cost. Manual tuning a PI loop is cumbersome and time-consuming, and cannot accommodate changes in system dynamics. Therefore, autotuning PI control loops based on the non-linearity of controlled systems is imperative. ^ The objective {{of this study is to}} develop easy-to-use and model-identification-free auto-tuning algorithms for the supply air temperature control system using a <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>coil.</b> To achieve this goal, a thorough investigation is conducted on such temperature control systems. The ratio of the P gain to I gain is deduced through model reduction. ^ The characteristics of each component in a typical temperature control system and their impacts on the control system dynamics are also analyzed. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that the supply air temperature control system is a purely nonlinear system when the coil overall heat transfer coefficient is not constant. ^ This study finds that the controller gain ratio is associated with the valve position when the loop pressure is constant or known. The relationship between the valve position and controller gain ratio are developed for different types of valves to link system operations with controller tuning. ^ Three tuning algorithms, one-dimensional, two-dimensional and integrated tuning, are provided. One-dimensional method uses a fixed controller ratio to tune the loop. Two dimensional tuning are developed based on the Hook-Jeeves pattern search method. Integrated tuning method makes use of the relationship between the controller gain ratio and control valve position to integrate system operations with control loop tuning to overcome the disadvantages of the one- and two-dimensional tuning methods. Implementation of the algorithms provides satisfactory tuning results. Especially, the integrated tuning method is superior to other methods. ^ The analysis and the implementation of this study demonstrate that integrating system operations with controller tuning is the best solution on auto-tuning PI loops. ...|$|E
40|$|Proposals {{to energy}} saving {{measures}} during oil storage and handling are presented in this report. The proposals are based on measurements and evaluations of operating and storage conditions in non-stirred oil storage tank equipped with <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>coils.</b> Detailed knowledge about flow and temperature fields in both tank and heating coils has rendered possible by modelling the system in CFD. A model has been created by gradually simplifications in the geometry of the tank. The model {{has been able to}} render a solution despite limited computer capacity, a solution which correlated with measurement data. The investigated tank has proved to have large energy losses, about 65 % of the supplied heat, which arises from the inferior insulation. Theoretical calculations have been carried out at different insulation thicknesses and a moderately improved insulation can reduce the energy losses to about 10 %. The results from the simulations have shown that the <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>coils</b> are poorly dimensioned in order to enable a quick heating of the oil. A large part of the heat transfer area of the coils is not utilized due to a quick temperature drop of the <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> which is caused by a low flow rate inside the coils. The investigated tank is shown to provide satisfactory spontaneous mixing, which leads to the conclusion that no mixing equipment is necessary. The measurements have indicated that the regulation of the <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> flow is insufficient. There are several problems that should be further investigated and attended to. Examples of these are the response time of the system, unstable <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> flow and high energy consumption in an empty tank.

40|$|The {{castor bean}} belongs to {{that group of}} seeds that contain large {{quantities}} of fat and no carbohydrate before germination. As germination proceeds the fat stores decrease and carbohydrate appears (Green, 1890) (see also Paper III following). The purpose {{of this investigation was}} {{to determine whether or not}} the combustion respiratory quotient rose with succeeding stages of germination, thus indicating a change from an oxygen-poor to an oxygen-rich substance. Apparatus By combining the Benedict and Fox (1925) oxycalorimeter and the Benedict universal metabolism apparatus and introducing a more effective cooler, one is enabled to obtain accurate respiratory quotients upon the combustion of small amounts of thoroughly dried plant or animal material. Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic illustration of the arrangement. The cooler is made from a <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> heater <b>coil</b> installed in a large metal can filled with cold water.

If one is very careful to keep drafts from the spirometer bell and quickly cool the Pyrex lamp chimney with a cold wet cloth immediately following the combustion, there is no difficulty in keeping the temperature of the air in the spirometer at the same point as it was before combustion. This eliminates temperature change corrections. In order to check the accuracy of the apparatus e. P. sucrose was used.

The initial corn or cassava meal content for extractive fermentations was 30 % or 25 % (w/v). The fermentations were conducted in a 7 -L static fermentor (Baoxing Bioengineering Co., Shanghai, China) equipped with pH and ORP (oxidative-reductive potential) electrodes and a manual adjusted pressure unit. A temperature-controllable water bath (MP- 10, Shanghai Permanent Science and Technology, Co., Shanghai, China) was used to circulate <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> into the <b>coil</b> pipes settled inside the fermentor to maintain broth temperature at 37 °C. The fermentation medium loading volume ranged from 1.8 to 2.5  L, and equivalent volume of oleyl alcohol was added to ensure a 1 : 1 oil/broth volumetric ratio. N 2 was sparged into the extractant reservoir for 10  min to remove residual oxygen. 10 % (v/v) inoculum was transferred into the fermentor and then N 2 was also sparged into broth for 10  min. The oxygen-free oleyl alcohol was poured into the fermentor using a peristaltic pump after inoculation. The initial pressure inside the fermentor was controlled at about 0.02  MPa (N 2) to strictly maintain the anaerobic condition. The pressure gradually increased since fermentation started and self-generated gas began to evolve. The pressure was then controlled in a range of 0.030 to 0.055  MPa throughout fermentation. Agitation was occasionally adopted for a short time (5  min, 400  rpm) to promote butanol diffusion from aqueous phase into extractant phase.|$|R
