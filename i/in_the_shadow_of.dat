5|$|By June, {{the band}} had {{performed}} another Italian tour (the third that year) {{and wanted to}} start recording new material (some of which ended up on Hammill's 1973 solo album Chameleon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> the Night). However, the combination of working for too long without a break, combined {{with a lack of}} support from Stratton-Smith and Charisma and continued financial difficulties caused the band to implode, and Hammill left to pursue a solo career in mid-1972.|$|E
5|$|In Edgbaston, Tolkien {{lived there}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> Perrott's Folly and the Victorian tower of Edgbaston Waterworks, {{which may have}} {{influenced}} {{the images of the}} dark towers within his works. Another strong influence was the romantic medievalist paintings of Edward Burne-Jones and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood; the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery had a large collection of works on public display.|$|E

5|$|In his {{monograph}} Project Apollo: The Tough Decisions, Deputy Administrator Seamans {{wrote that}} NASA's single worst mistake in engineering judgment {{was not to}} run a fire test on the Command Module before the plugs-out test. In the first episode of the 2009 BBC documentary series NASA: Triumph and Tragedy, Jim McDivitt said that NASA {{had no idea how}} a 100% oxygen atmosphere would influence burning. Similar remarks by other astronauts were expressed in the 2007 documentary film <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> the Moon.|$|E

5|$|In February 1965 Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin {{travelled}} to Hanoi {{to rebuild}} Soviet ties with North Vietnam, {{and the formation}} of a military alliance was on the agenda. Coincidentally, senior security adviser to the U.S. President McGeorge Bundy was also in Saigon to report on the political chaos in South Vietnam. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> those events, the Viet Cong 409th Battalion staged an attack on Camp Holloway on 7 February 1965. This time, with his victory in the 1964 presidential election secured, Johnson decided to launch Operation Flaming Dart which entailed strikes on North Vietnamese military targets. However, with Kosygin still in Hanoi during the U.S bombing, the Soviet government decided to step up their military aid to North Vietnam, thereby signalling a major reversal of Khrushchev's policy in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Iori is {{a violent}} and sadistic person {{who suffers from}} trauma because of his clan's past. In ancient times, the Yagami clan {{was known as the}} Yasakani. With the help of the Yata and Kusanagi clans, they sealed the demon Orochi. As time passed, the Yasakani, tired of living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> the Kusanagi, made a blood pact with Orochi. This gave them greater powers, but in return, they and their {{descendants}} were forever cursed. They renamed their clan the Yagami and set out to destroy the Kusanagi with their new powers. In response, the Kusanagi declared war on the Yagami, which led to many clan members on both sides being killed.|$|E
5|$|Morell {{continued}} {{to appear in}} Hammer's horror films in the ensuing decade. He had parts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> the Cat (1960), She (1964, again with Peter Cushing) and its sequel Vengeance of She (1967), the lead in The Plague of the Zombies (1965), and The Mummy's Shroud (1966). He also starred with Cushing in Hammer's Cash on Demand, playing the same role he had played opposite Richard Vernon in the original TV play, The Gold Inside. He turned down the opportunity of reprising the title role in Hammer's feature film adaptation of Quatermass and the Pit (1967). He {{did not wish to}} repeat himself.|$|E

5|$|Off the {{expressway}} and now at-grade, NY47 turned north onto NY383, {{forming a}} short concurrency with NY383 into Rochester. At Elmwood Avenue, NY47 and NY383 departed Scottsville Road and proceeded eastward on Elmwood Avenue. Two {{blocks to the}} east, at an intersection with South Plymouth Avenue, NY383 split from NY47, following Plymouth Avenue into downtown Rochester. NY47 remained routed on Elmwood Avenue, crossing the Genesee River and passing north of Strong Memorial Hospital prior to intersecting NY15 (Mount Hope Avenue) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> Mount Hope Cemetery. East of NY15, NY47 progressed along Elmwood Avenue, intersecting several local streets before entering Brighton.|$|E
5|$|Savage {{followed}} {{his first book}} with Delilah of Harlem, The Mask of Venus, Our Mysterious Passenger and Other Stories and <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> the Pyramids. In addition to his fiction prose output, Savage published collections of his speeches and essays, and in 1895 wrote a book of poetry dedicated to his wife: After Many Years. Savage's writing style was fast and precise: he wrote from morning to night and rarely needed to correct his first drafts. He was able {{to carry on a}} conversation while writing. He joined the Author's Guild of America in 1894.|$|E
5|$|The Saskatchewan Métis' {{requested}} land grants {{were all}} {{provided by the}} government {{by the end of}} 1887, and the government resurveyed the Métis river lots in accordance with their wishes. The Métis did not understand the long term value of their new land, however, and it was soon bought by speculators who later turned huge profits from it. Riel's worst fears were realised—following the failed rebellion, the French language and Roman Catholic religion faced increasing marginalisation in both Saskatchewan and Manitoba, as exemplified by the controversy surrounding the Manitoba Schools Question. The Métis themselves were increasingly forced to live on undesirable land or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> Indian reserves (as they did not themselves have treaty status). Saskatchewan did not attain provincehood until 1905.|$|E

5|$|While in office, in 2001 Reed {{served as}} the {{campaign}} manager in Shirley Franklin's successful election campaign to become the 58th Mayor of Atlanta. As a campaign manager in an election occurring <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> the September 11 attacks, he surveyed potential voters' perceptions of the propriety of the campaign's advertising broadcasts. At the time certain ads were thought to focus on sensitive topics. After winning the election, Franklin chose Reed as one of two co-chairs on her transition team. In this role {{he was charged with}} identifying and reviewing candidates for cabinet-level positions.|$|E
5|$|A short {{distance}} past the city line, NY5 passes over the Union Ship Canal on {{a span of}} the elevated road known as the Father Baker Bridge. North of the waterway, the Skyway gains a frontage road named Fuhrmann Boulevard. Both the service road and the Skyway run parallel to Lake Erie until {{the northern end of}} the Buffalo Outer Harbor. Here, the frontage roads end while NY5 turns to the northeast, crossing the Buffalo River and entering downtown. On the north bank, the Skyway returns to a northerly routing as it passes KeyBank Center, located directly to the east, and Buffalo and Erie County Naval & Military Park, situated to the west, and meets I-190 at exit7. Past the interchange, the Skyway ends and the route descends in elevation, becoming an at-grade roadway once more at Church Street <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> Buffalo City Hall. NY384 begins here, following Delaware Avenue north into the heart of downtown, while NY5 turns east onto Church.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{was born}} in the Small Heath area of Birmingham, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> St Andrew's, the home stadium of Birmingham City. Support for Birmingham City ran in the family; his uncle played for the club in the 1920s. In 1943, aged 14, he began work at the Post Office. He played {{football}} for the works team, and quickly received an invitation to play for Moor Green, one of the strongest amateur teams in the area. His performances for Moor Green resulted in interest from Birmingham City, and Barnes became part of their junior team, Birmingham City Colts. Barnes worked at the Post Office during the day, trained with Moor Green in the evening, and played for Birmingham City Colts at the weekend. However, the Colts stopped selecting Barnes after a clash of matches, in which Barnes chose to play for a local team instead of the Colts. Barnes then resumed playing for Moor Green.|$|E
