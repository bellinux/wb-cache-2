5|$|Freedom of {{the press}} is limited, with {{numerous}} restrictions on publishing rights and <b>information</b> <b>dissemination.</b> The government has previously tried {{to crack down on}} opposition papers before elections. In 2007, a government agency issued a directive to all private television and radio stations to refrain from broadcasting speeches made by opposition leaders, a move condemned by politicians from the opposition Democratic Action Party. Sabah, where all tabloids but one are independent of government control, has the freest press in Malaysia. Laws such as the Printing Presses and Publications Act have also been cited as curtailing freedom of expression.|$|E

500|$|Treloar {{left his}} {{position}} at the Memorial {{for the duration of}} World War II. In September 1939 Treloar's close friend Henry Gullett, who at the time was the Minister for Information, appointed him the inaugural secretary of the Department of Information (DOI). The DOI was the first of 17 new Australian Government departments to be established during the war, and was responsible for both censorship and disseminating government propaganda. Treloar [...] ran the department in line with traditional Australian Public Service practices and took steps to prevent the its work from being politicised. To achieve this, he implemented tight internal controls over the DOI's procedures and <b>information</b> <b>dissemination</b> functions and instructed subordinates to not defend the government from criticism. He remained the departmental secretary after Gullett was moved to a different ministry in March 1940, but lost status when Keith Murdoch was appointed to the new position of Director-General of Information in June that year. Murdoch's appointment was part of a government campaign to generate public support for increased armaments production following the fall of France, and he placed a stronger emphasis on generating propaganda. Treloar was troubled by the use of the DOI's photographers to produce publicity photographs instead of images with historical value. Gullet was killed in the Canberra air disaster on 13August 1940. Treloar regained full control of the DOI in December that year when Murdoch resigned, though its photographers were still mainly tasked with taking publicity photos.|$|E

30|$|The {{physical}} topology connectivity poses {{a great challenge}} to the emerging and promising VANETs, especially in highway scenarios. The existence of isolated nodes not only restricts the <b>information</b> <b>disseminations</b> within the entire network but also exacerbates the end-to-end delay. This paper investigates an essential prerequisite, namely the minimum node degree, of k-connected vehicular ad hoc networks, with a homogeneous range assignment in highway scenarios. Among other things, we simulated the mobility of vehicles with realistic trace data, modeled the network as a geometric random graph, and also derived an analytical algorithm to estimate the probability that each node in the network has at least k neighbors. Extensive experiments were undertaken to verify the derived algorithm, with border effect, via realistic mobility traces.|$|R

In this paper, we propose a method of combining the features of cryptography and steganography to provide security to data in the Internet. We employ the techniques of vigenere cipher to scramble the message and then embed the encrypted message using the least significant bit method. The method provides confidentiality to <b>information</b> <b>disseminations</b> with the assumption that the adversary does not have the decrypting oracle mechanism...|$|R
