The Bangladeshi team <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> {{moderately}} successful tour of England, by their standards, as they pushed Australia close in one ODI and beat them in another. However, they still lost {{five out of}} six matches in the NatWest Series, and both of the Test matches, and remain {{at the bottom of}} both the ICC Test Championship and ICC ODI Championship.

50|$|Methamphetamine, on {{the other}} hand, does affect the C. stygia larval development. Larva that had been raised on meth-infused meat {{developed}} faster and ended up larger in size, and weight. The increase in body size poses a problem for determining relative ages of larva since most use body size {{as an indication of}} age. Time estimates can be up to 78 hours off. The other difficulty for establishing time of death is determining what species of insect <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> cadaver. Since methamphetamines are toxic to C. stygia most flies die in the pupal stage, it is difficult to make proper identifications.|$|E
