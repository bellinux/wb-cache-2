50|$|Esparza studied {{medicine}} at the Universidad del Zulia Medical School (Maracaibo), where he obtained an M.D. in 1968. During his undergraduate teenage years, Esparza teamed up {{with some of his}} teachers in viral research studies designed to characterize a large zoonotic outbreak of Venezuelan equine encephalitis affecting people and riding beasts in the nearby Guajira region and its surroundings. He entered IVIC (Caracas) to work at as a graduate student under the guidance of Gernot H. Bergold and then moved to Houston, TX, to pursue graduate studies under the mentorship of virologist Priscilla Shaffer and attend advanced virology courses given by Joseph L. Melnick. Esparza obtained his Ph.D. degree in virology and cell biology from Baylor College of Medicine in 1974. He then returned to Venezuela to work at IVIC where he became chairman and full professor of virology in 1985. As part of a sabbatical leave Esparza was invited by the Department of Microbiology & Immunology at Duke University (Durham, N.C.) to work with Wolfgang Joklik. At Durham, Esparza applied modern methods of molecular engineering to study reoviruses. He also applied such tools to the study of rotaviruses, a leading worldwide cause of <b>infantile</b> <b>diarrhea</b> which severely affects and causes many deaths in toddlers living in developing countries like Venezuela. By this stage Esparza had attained hands-on command of many aspects of viral research techniques (i.e., virus-isolation, culture, serotyping, structure, genetic engineering and vaccine development) as well as project-management expertise while heading studies of a variety of human viral pathologies including enchephalitis, herpes, and rotaviruses. In 1986 Esparza was then recruited as a medical officer by the Division of Communicable Diseases of the World Health Organization, a position which implied worldwide supervising responsibilities of research projects involving various vector-borne viral diseases such as yellow fever, dengue, encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever. In 1988 Esparza joined the recently created WHO Global Programme on AIDS and in 1996 he was required to head the Vaccine Development Unit sponsored jointly by WHO-UNAIDS, a task he undertook until 2004. He then joined the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Seattle) from 2004 to 2014, first as senior adviser on HIV Vaccines, and from 2011 as senior adviser on global health and vaccines. He then moved to Washington(DC), occupying a position as adjunct professor of {{medicine at}} the Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, where he continues writing about conceptual aspects of HIV-vaccine development and participating in the monitoring of some of the ongoing clinical trials for HIV-vaccine.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{observe the}} {{application}} effect of Xiyanping {{in the treatment}} of <b>infantile</b> rotavirus <b>diarrhea.</b> Methods: A total of 80 children with rotavirus diarrhea who were admitted in our hospital from January, 2014 to April, 2015 were included in the study and randomized into the treatment group and the control group with 40 cases in each group. The patients in the two groups were given ribavirin 10 mg/kg. d, iv drip, qd. On this basis, the patients in the treatment group were given additional Xiyanping injection 7. 5 mg/kg, iv drip, qd. The symptom and sign relieving time and temperature reduced degree after treatment in the two groups were compared. The serum BDNF, NGF, and NTF levels in the two groups were detected. Results: The treatment total effective rate in the treatment group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P< 0. 05).

40|$|The virologic {{character}} of human rotavirus strains prevailing in Bangladesh {{was investigated in}} relation to the devastating nationwide floods brought by the 1988 monsoon. Human rotaviruses contained in stool specimens that were collected from inpatients with <b>infantile</b> and adult <b>diarrhea</b> in two hospitals in Mymensingh over a 13 -month period (January 1988 to January 1989) and in one hospital in Dhaka over a 3 -month period (February to April 1988) were examined for their subgroup, VP 7 serotype, and RNA electropherotype. In concurrence with the spread of the flood (from the middle of August 1988), the number of <b>infantile</b> and adult <b>diarrhea</b> patients increased greatly. At the same time, the proportion of rotavirus-positive specimens in all diarrhea cases also increased remarkably, reaching 54 and 45 % in September and October, respectively. An electrophoretic analysis of viral RNA revealed 17 distinct patterns of viral RNA (14 long and 3 short electropherotypes) and a considerable number of mixed electropherotypes, suggesting the simultaneous infection of some patients with more than two rotavirus strains. It was noteworthy that electropherotypes of rotavirus strains prevailing in the community changed considerably after the spreading of the flood and that the frequency of virus specimens showing mixed electropherotypes increased significantly during the flood period. These results suggest that sudden environmental change caused by the devastating floods seriously affected the epidemiology of rotavirus infections by increasing the opportunity of transmission of the virus and by reducing the resistance of the host to infection.

40|$|Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is {{classified}} as typical (tEPEC) or atypical (aEPEC) based on {{the presence or absence}} of the E. coli adherence factor plasmid (pEAF), respectively. The hallmark of EPEC infection is the formation of the attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions on the gut mucosa. We compared the kinetics of A/E lesion formation induced by aEPEC and tEPEC. The examination of infected HEp- 2 cells clearly demonstrated delayed A/E lesion formation by aEPEC in comparison to tEPEC. This delay was associated with the expression of locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) -encoded virulence factors (i. e., intimin and EspD). Indeed, the insertion of a plasmid containing perABC, a transcriptional regulator of virulence factors involved in A/E formation, into aEPEC strains increased and accelerated the formation of A/E lesions. Interestingly, the enhanced expression and translocation of LEE-encoded proteins, such as those expressed in LEE 5 (intimin) and LEE 4 (EspD), in aEPEC (perABC) was independent of bacterial adhesion. The secretion kinetics of these two proteins representing LEE 5 and LEE 4 expression corre-lated with A/E lesion formation. We conclude that the lack of Per in the regulation network of virulence genes is one of the main factors that delay the establishment of A/E lesions induced by aEPEC strains. Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is one of the maincausative agents of <b>infantile</b> acute <b>diarrhea</b> in developing countries (1 – 4).

The World Health Organization has been recommending the assessment of rotavirus burden and strain characterization as part of the strategies of immunization programs against this pathogen. In this context, a prospective study was made on a sample of 134 children with acute diarrhea and severe dehydration admitted to venous fluid therapy in two state hospitals in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from February to September 2004. Rotavirus where detected by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and by an enzyme-linked immunoassay to rotavirus and adenovirus (EIARA) in 48 % of the children. Positive samples for group A rotavirus (n = 65) were analyzed by reverse transcription/heminested multiplex polymerase chain reaction to determine the frequency of G and [P] genotypes and, from these, 64 samples could be typed. The most frequent G genotype was G 1 (58 %) followed by G 9 (40 %). One mixed infection (G 1 /G 9) was detected. The only [P] genotype identified was [8].

40|$|Rotaviruses are {{icosahedral}} viruses with a segmented, double-stranded RNA genome. They are {{the major}} cause of severe <b>infantile</b> infectious <b>diarrhea.</b> Rotavirus growth in tissue culture is markedly enhanced by pretreatment of virus with trypsin. Trypsin activation is associated with cleavage of the viral hemagglutinin (viral protein 3 [VP 3]; 88 kilodaltons) into two fragments (60 and 28 kilodaltons). The mechanism by which proteolytic cleavage leads to enhanced growth is unknown. Cleavage of VP 3 does not alter viral binding to cell monolayers. In previous electron microscopic studies of infected cell cultures, it has been demonstrated that rotavirus particles enter cells by both endocytosis and direct cell membrane penetration. To determine whether trypsin treatment affected rotavirus internalization, we studied the kinetics of entry of infectious rhesus rotavirus (RRV) into MA 104 cells. Trypsin-activated RRV was internalized with a half-time of 3 to 5 min, while nonactivated virus disappeared from the cell surface with a half-time of 30 to 50 min. In contrast to trypsin-activated RRV, loss of nonactivated RRV from the cell surface {{did not result in}} the appearance of infection, as measured by plaque formation. Endocytosis inhibitors (sodium azide, dinitrophenol) and lysosomotropic agents (ammonium chloride, chloroquine) had a limited effect on the entry of infectious virus into cells. Purified trypsin-activated RRV added to cell monolayers at pH 7. 4 medicated 51 Cr, [14 C]choline, and [3 H]inositol released from prelabeled MA 104 cells. This release could be specifically blocked by neutralizing antibodies to VP 3. These results suggest that MA 104 cell infection follows the rapid entry of trypsin-activated RRV by direct cell membrane penetration. Cell membrane penetration of infectious RRV is initiated by trypsin cleavage of VP 3. Neutralizing antibodies can inhibit this direct membrane penetration...|$|R

Tratou-se de um estudo metodolÃgico e de um estudo de desenvolvimento, adotando-se o polo teÃrico, empÃrico e analÃtico para a construÃÃo de escalas, propostos por Pasquali (1997). No polo teÃrico, identificou-se e se aprofundou o construto de interesse prevenÃÃo da diarreia infantil, para tanto se realizou um levantamento bibliogrÃfico, utilizando os descritores âcrianÃaâ, âprevenÃÃo e controleâ, âdiarreiaâ nas bases de dados PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane e LILACS. A sÃntese de 82 estudos selecionados norteou a operacionalizaÃÃo da primeira versÃo da escala, com 35 itens, e a identificaÃÃo de quatro domÃnios: prÃticas alimentares, ambiente domÃstico, comportamento materno e higiene da crianÃa/infantil.

Realizados os cÃlculos do Ãndice de Validade de ConteÃdo â IVC, e as alteraÃÃes, sugeridas pelos participantes do polo teÃrico, obteve-se o instrumento-piloto composto por 25 itens. No polo empÃrico, a amostra foi de 448 mÃes de crianÃas menores de 5 anos, cadastradas em um dos seis Centros de SaÃde da FamÃlia no qual o estudo foi executado. Efetivou-se a coleta de dados de novembro de 2009 a fevereiro de 2010. Utilizou-se, alÃm do instrumento-piloto da escala com 25 itens, um formulÃrio abordando dados sociodemogrÃficos e dados relacionados Ã saÃde da crianÃa. No polo analÃtico, encontram-se a validade de construto e de critÃrio, o alfa de Cronbach e o Coeficiente de CorrelaÃÃo Intraclasse â CCIC. A validade de construto, atravÃs da anÃlise fatorial, indicou a necessidade de exclusÃo do item sete e a existÃncia de dois fatores/domÃnios (higiene da famÃlia, com 15 itens, e prÃticas alimentares/gerais, com 9 itens) na Escala de AutoeficÃcia Materna para PrevenÃÃo da Diarreia Infantil â EAPDI. Na validade de construto, procedeu-se ainda a testagem de hipÃteses por comparaÃÃo dos grupos contrastados. Nessa anÃlise, observou-se a correlaÃÃo negativa entre os escores mais elevados da autoeficÃcia materna em prevenir a diarreia infantil e a ocorrÃncia anterior de diarreia na crianÃa (p= 0, 001), assim como a associaÃÃo entre os escores mais elevados de autoeficÃcia, com mÃes que possuem mais idade (p= 0, 018). A validade de critÃrio, utilizando-se a validade preditiva, revelou que nÃveis elevados de autoeficÃcia materna configuram-se em fator protetor para diarreia infantil, de acordo com a especificidade e Valor Preditivo Negativo. O alfa de Cronbach da EAPDI foi de 0, 84, indicando alta consistÃncia interna. O CCIC, na anÃlise da estabilidade teste-reteste, foi de 0, 45, demonstrando a capacidade de aplicaÃÃo da EAPDI mesmo com o passar do tempo.

Motherâs {{confidence in}} their ability to provide good care to their children has proven to be relevant when it comes to maternal health promotion. This dissertation aims to construct a scale in order to measure maternal self-efficacy for preventing <b>infantile</b> <b>diarrhea,</b> by creating its items and dimensions, as well as evaluating the instrumentâs psychometric aspects (validity and reliability). The following is both a research on methodology and development, having the model proposed by Pasquali on scale elaboration (1997) as our theoretical landmark. In the pre-empirical part, we carefully examined <b>infantile</b> <b>diarrhea</b> prevention as our construct of interest. The bibliographical survey searched for the keywords âchildrenâ, âprevention and controlâ, âdiarrheaâ on the PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane and LILACS database. The first version of the scale was led by the synthesis of 82 selected papers. It had 35 items and also presented four domains: alimentary habits, domestic environment, mother behavior and child hygiene. The 35 items were evaluated by 30 mothers (who performed the semantic analysis), by 31 other mothers who participated in the scale pre-test and also by seven experts in the construct field. After calculating the Content Validity Index (CVI) and making the proper alterations suggested by the mentioned participators, the pilot test was elaborated, containing itself 25 items. In the empirical part of this paper, the selected sample was formed by 448 mothers of less than 5 years old children. Those women were all registered on one of the six Family Health Centers in which the research took place. Data collection was performed from November of 2009 to February of 2010. A questionnaire on socio-demographic elements and child health aspects was used along with the pilot test. The analytical work involved the construct validity, the criterion validity, Cronbachâs alpha and Intraclass Correlation Coeficient (ICC). Construct validity, through the factor analysis, has indicated the need for exclusion of the item seven and has also shown the existence of two factors/domains (family hygiene, formed by 15 items; and alimentary/general habits, with 9 items) in the Maternal Self-Efficacy for <b>Infantile</b> <b>Diarrhea</b> Prevention Scale (MSIDPS). Regarding the construct validity, hypotheses were tested by contrasting groups comparison. A negative correlation has been observed between the higher maternal self-efficacy for <b>infantile</b> <b>diarrhea</b> prevention scores and the previous occurrence of diarrhea in the child (p= 0, 001). The higher self-efficacy scores were also associated with older mothers (p= 0, 018). By using predictive validity, the criterion validity has shown that higher levels of maternal self-efficacy turned out to be a protective factor against <b>infantile</b> <b>diarrhea,</b> according to specificity and to Negative Predictive Value. Cronbachâs alpha of the MSIDPS was 0, 84, which indicates high internal consistency. ICC, after test-retest stability analysis, was 0, 45, showing the scaleâs applicability throughout time. This dissertation has come to the conclusion that the scale is reliable, valid and capable of evaluating maternal self-efficacy for <b>infantile</b> <b>diarrhea</b> prevention...|$|E
40|$|An enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli strain (strain 2230), {{isolated}} {{from a patient}} with acute <b>infantile</b> <b>diarrhea,</b> was found to adhere only to the brush border of human intestinal epithelial cells. This strain does not hemagglutinate human, bovine, chicken, or guinea pig erythrocytes. The adhesion of E. coli 2230 appears to be mediated by a nonfimbrial bacterial surface protein of 16, 000 daltons which can be extracted by heating the bacteria at 60 degrees C for 20 min. This surface protein is implicated as an adhesive factor because pretreatment of enterocytes with this protein extract completely inhibits the adhesion of E. coli 2230. This adhesive factor is serologically distinct from other adhesive factors found in enterotoxigenic E. coli strains. A plasmid DNA of 66 megadaltons {{is involved in the}} synthesis of this nonfimbrial adhesive factor...|$|E
40|$|Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli {{serogroup}} O 126 isolates {{have been}} isolated in Hong Kong since 1982 from sporadic cases of <b>infantile</b> <b>diarrhea</b> and from one outbreak in a neonatal ward. A 64 -megadalton plasmid encoding colonization factor antigen I and heat-stable enterotoxin was identified in all 23 isolates. Enterotoxigenic E. coli strains producing heat-stable enterotoxin from {{different regions of}} Southeast Asia were collected and compared by biotyping, antibiotic resistance patterns, and plasmid profiles. Restriction endonuclease digestion of plasmids and subsequent Southern blot analysis with the heat-stable enterotoxin gene probe of representative strains showed a unique plasmid was harbored by all heat-stable enterotoxin-producing O 126 strains tested. These {{results are consistent with}} conservative inheritance of enterotoxin plasmids within enterotoxigenic E. coli strains over a 2 -year period in Hong Kong. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{large number}} of cases of <b>infantile</b> <b>diarrhea</b> to which a {{definite}} bacterial or protozoal etiologic agent cannot be as-signed has for many years led to an assumption that viral agents must {{play an important role in}} the production of this syndrome. Enteroviruses have been especially suspected because they are frequently isolated from the con-tents of the gastrointestinal tract. Many syndromes have been clearly dem-onstrated to be due to members of the enteroviruses group: poliomyelitis with or without paralysis, pleurodynia, her-pangina, undifferentiated febrile illness, myocarditis, pericarditis and Boston exanthem. In any one of these syn-dromes diarrhea may be a symptom. However, the question posed here is whether the enteroviruses can primarily infect the gastrointestinal tract with the production of gastroenteritis alone and, if so, how important are the entero-viruses in the production of diarrhea in the infant...|$|E
40|$|An enteropathogenic Escherichia coli mutant {{carrying}} an internal deletion in the eaeB gene (UMD 864) {{was unable to}} activate epithelial cell signals, including tyrosine phosphorylation, cytoskeletal rearrangements, {{and the release of}} inositol phosphates, indicating that the eaeB locus encodes a product that is involved in stimulating signals in epithelial cells. Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is a leading cause of <b>infantile</b> <b>diarrhea,</b> mediated through bacterium-host cell contact, in developing countries (11). Following initial attach-ment, EPEC exploits host cell signaling pathways to promote intimate adherence. The resulting attaching and effacing lesion is characterized by a loss of microvilli and the rearrangement of host cell tyrosine-phosphorylated and cytoskeletal proteins (6, 9, 13). A mutant was recently constructed by creating a deletion in the eaeB gene, which is located approximately 5 kb downstream of the eaeA gene on the EPEC chromosome (4). The AeaeB deletion mutant (UMD 864) is unable to attac...|$|E
40|$|IIF in the {{detection}} of invasive and classic enteropathogenic E. coli and Shigella serotypes was compared with traditional coproculture methods. IIP results agreed with the coproculture findings in 128 out of 140 cases tested for enteropathogenic E. coli (91 %) and in 108 out of 112 for Shigella (96 %). All cases with positive reactions by coproculture were confirmed by IIP. In the control group it were obtained by IIF 12 cases with positive reactions for enteropathogenic E. coli and 4 cases for Shigella, including two cases of mixed infection by E. coli 026 /Sh. dysenteriae and E. coli 0124 /Sh. dysenteriae. It was discussed the high sensitivity and specificity of the IIF {{when compared with the}} traditional methods, being suggested that IIF is a valuable tool in epidemiological studies involving these organisms and an important aid in the stablishment of an early presumptive diagnosis of the acute <b>infantile</b> <b>diarrhea...</b>|$|E
40|$|The autopsy {{findings}} and certain other features {{are described in}} 16 fatal cases of <b>infantile</b> <b>diarrhea</b> associated with enteropathogenic Escherichia coli infection during the 1963 epidemic in Newfoundland which resulted in 100 deaths. Age {{is an important factor}} in the severity of the infection and in the outcome. Almost one-half the patients were under 4 months and a third under 2 months. Pathological changes in the gastrointestinal tract were meagre and were not pathognomonic. Other pathological {{findings and}} their possible role in the severity and fatal outcome in enteropathogenic Escherichia coli gastroenteritis are discussed. Such conditions as prematurity, congenital anomaly, trauma, neoplasm and metabolic disorders were, no doubt, also important factors in the outcome. Severe respiratory tract infection was the leading terminal cause of death. No sex, seasonal or geographic variation was found.

40|$|O 55 {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) O serogroups implicated in <b>infantile</b> <b>diarrhea</b> in developing countries. Multilocus enzyme electrophoresis analysis showed that this serogroup includes two major electrophoretic types (ET), designated ET 1 and ET 5. ET 1 corresponds to typical EPEC, whilst ET 5 comprises strains with different combinations of virulence genes, including those for localized adherence (LA) and diffuse adherence (DA). Here we report that ET 5 DA strains possess a DA adhesin, designated EPEC Afa. An 11. 6 -kb chromosomal region including the DA adhesin operon from one O 55 :H− ET 5 EPEC strain was sequenced and found to encode a protein with 98 % identity to AfaE- 1, an adhesin associated with uropathogenic E. coli. Although described as an afimbrial adhesin, we show that both AfaE- 1 and EPEC Afa possess fine fibrillar structures. This is the first characterization and demonstration of an Afa adhesin associated with EPEC...|$|E
