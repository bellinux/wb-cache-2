40|$|The Indian Head Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center (IHDIV, NSWC) is {{conducting}} a qualification program for a laser-ignited, all-secondary (DDT) <b>explosive</b> <b>detonator.</b> This detonator was developed jointly by IHDIV, NSWC and the Department of Energy's EG&G Mound Applied Technologies facility in Miamisburg, Ohio to accept a laser initiation signal and produce a fully developed shock wave output. The detonator performance requirements were established by the on-going IHDIV, NSWC Laser Initiated Transfer Energy Subsystem (LITES) advanced development program. Qualification of the detonator as a component utilizing existing military specifications is the selected approach for this program. The detonator is a deflagration-to-detonator transfer (DDT) device using a secondary explosive, HMX, to generate the required shock wave output. The prototype development and initial system integration tests for the LITES and for the detonator were reported at the 1992 International Pyrotechnics Society Symposium and at the 1992 Survival and Flight Equipment National Symposium. Recent results are presented for the all-fire sensitivity and qualification tests conducted at two different laser initiation pulses...|$|E
40|$|Detonations in decane aerosol-oxygen {{mixtures}} {{were studied}} {{with the aim}} being {{to contribute to the}} understanding of the mechanisms of propagation of the detonation front. The decane aerosol, of about 5 $ mu$m droplet size, is generated by an ultrasonic nebulizer and remains in the liquid phase prior to ignition. A vertical detonation tube 64 mm in diameter and 3 m long was used. Ignition of the mixtures was attained using an exploding wire (120 Joules stored energy) or a solid <b>explosive</b> <b>detonator.</b> Comparison of the experimentally measured detonation velocity and pressure to the theoretical Chapman-Jouguet velocity and pressure indicates the existence of a self-sustained heterogeneous detonation. Cellular structure was recorded on soot covered metallic foils, indicating a three-dimensional detonation structure similar to gas phase detonations. The physical processes of breakup, heat transfer, evaporation, and mixing present in the heterogeneous medium were eliminated by heating of the mixtures to the vapor phase. Comparison of cell size for the same mixtures in the heterogeneous liquid phase and in the homogeneous vapor phase reveals that aerosol detonations possess physical processes that increase the length scale of the detonation. Furthermore, the measurements of cellular structure obtained experimentally are compared with the computed results determined using a chemical kinetic detonation model and the length scales of the mixtures in the vapor phase are found to be in good agreement with the computed results...|$|E

40|$|Seventeen steam {{explosion}} experiments were performed with 2 to 10 g drops of molten, high-purity Al. Seven were successfully initiated with underwater exploding bridgewires. At melt release temperatures up to 1400 {degrees}C (1673 K) only moderate thermal-type explosions occurred that produced bubbles with volumes up to approximately 1 L. Bubble growth intensified in the melt temperature range 1400 - 1525 {degrees}C (1673 [...] 1798 K) as threshold ignition of Al set in. In this range, {{one of the}} explosions emitted {{a flash of light}} and generated a bubble that grew very rapidly to approximately 14 L, broke through the water surface, and destroyed the test chamber. We attribute the behavior of this latter bubble, which grew as fast as one produced by the underwater firing of a 0. 6 g <b>explosive</b> <b>detonator,</b> to an ignition-type {{steam explosion}}. Aluminum oxides could not be detected visually in the debris recovered from either typical thermal-type or the ignition-type explosions, and only traces could be detected by X-ray diffraction. In the ignition-type explosion, it is possible however that some oxidic material, probably the smaller particles, was lost during the flooding that occurred as the chamber failed. Both bubble analyses and the absence of appreciable oxide in the debris suggest that the ignition-type steam explosion was not very efficient, probably involving the combustion of {{only a small fraction of}} the original molten aluminum globule...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- To {{detonate}} <b>explosive,</b> <b>detonators</b> are used. Generally detonators {{can be of}} two types: Electrical and Percussion. A Percussion detonator {{responds to}} some type of mechanical force to activate an <b>explosive.</b> An electrical <b>detonator</b> responds to predefined electrical signal to activate an explosive. But there are various hazards associated with the electrical detonators like accidental initiation due to Electrostatic discharge or Radio frequency interference, improper firing of the circuit or problem in delay or logic of the circuit. So {{there was a need}} to develop a low energy, reliable and safe initiator in order to prevent catastrophes. Therefore the objective of this research is to design integrated SCB chip for explosive initiation along with its ESD and RF safety circuit, firing circuit and delay and logic circuit. SCB chip is used because of its features like reduced voltage and energy requirements are coupled with excellent safety features in comparison to hot-wired detonators. Integrated circuits like ESD and RF safety circuit are for ensuring the protection of the SCB chip, Firing circuit is for safe initiation of SCB and Delay circuit is for triggering the detonator with accuracy and reliability T I...|$|R
