25|$|Kenya is {{the world}} leader {{in the number of}} solar power systems {{installed}} per capita (but not the number of watts added).

500|$|In {{the parish}} accounts, the {{painting}} is first mentioned in 1636, at which time a [...] "M. Jacob Conterfeyer" [...] was recorded as having [...] "renewed the painting hanging on the northern wall". Modern scholarship has convincingly identified Jacob Heinrich Elbfas (1600–1664), guild master from 1628 and court painter of Queen Maria Eleonora from 1634, as the artist responsible. [...] Based on the brief note referencing the painting's [...] "renewal" [...] in 1636, it was long assumed that the extant painting {{was in fact the}} original from 1535, and that the work performed on it in the 17th century was little more than restoration of some kind. However, when the painting was taken down in mid-October 1998 to allow a group of experts from various fields to restore and document it, this notion had to be completely reassessed. A dendrochronological investigation showed that the wood used <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> came from trees cut down in the early 17th century: the painting in question must therefore be a copy and not the restored original.|$|E
30|$|On average {{across all}} chromosomes, LD reached {{half of its}} {{original}} value at around 90 Kb <b>for</b> <b>the</b> indica <b>panel</b> and around 200 Kb <b>for</b> <b>the</b> tropical japonica <b>panel</b> (Additional file 4 : Figure S 1). LD dropped to an r 2 value of 0.2 within 140  kb in <b>the</b> indica <b>panel</b> and 440  kb in <b>the</b> tropical japonica <b>panel.</b> LD was rather high in both panels. LD extended over longer distances (almost three times longer) in <b>the</b> tropical japonica <b>panel</b> than in <b>the</b> indica <b>panel.</b> These differences between subspecies were also reported by Mather et al. (2007). As a consequence, a much larger number of markers {{would be required to}} achieve the same genome coverage <b>for</b> <b>the</b> indica <b>panel</b> than <b>for</b> <b>the</b> japonica <b>panel.</b> In this study we used 14, 187 markers <b>for</b> <b>the</b> indica <b>panel</b> and 12, 438 markers <b>for</b> <b>the</b> japonica <b>panel.</b> Marker density was heterogeneous along chromosomes particularly in <b>the</b> japonica <b>panel.</b> In <b>the</b> indica <b>panel,</b> we counted 16 gaps of over 0.5  Mb between markers, and one of them on chromosome 2 reached 3.5  Mb. In <b>the</b> japonica <b>panel,</b> we counted 61 such gaps, and one of them on chromosome 5 reached 2.7  Mb. Nevertheless, the average distance between adjacent markers of 24  kb in <b>the</b> indica <b>panel</b> and of 30  kb in <b>the</b> tropical japonica <b>panel</b> was below LD decay in both cases and the average genome coverage was considered fair enough to detect and map resistance loci.|$|R
