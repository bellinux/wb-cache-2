50|$|These fenders are {{extensively}} {{used for}} {{ship to ship}} transfers at mid seas, double banking operations, and as vessel-to-berth at dock/jetties. The special property of a pneumatic fender is its low reaction force at low deflection. This property of pneumatic fenders makes them the most suitable fender for liquid cargo vessels and defense vessels with very sensitive equipment. These fenders have excellent energy absorption characteristics and linear load deflection characteristics. Pneumatic fenders should comply to the ISO 17357 standard.The pneumatic fender {{is also known as}} the Yokohama fender or <b>floating</b> <b>fender.</b> There are four basic types of pneumatic fenders that comply with the international standard: Type I (Chain&Tyre Net Type), Type II (Sling Type), Type III (Rib Type) and Type IV (Rope Net Type). It has become an ideal ship protection medium used extensively by large tankers, LPG vessels, ocean platforms etc. The most appropriate type will depend on its application and the requirements of the equipment.|$|E
50|$|For {{bunkering}} operations {{between two}} vessels, <b>floating</b> <b>fenders</b> such as pneumatic or foam elastomer fenders are typically used.|$|R
50|$|Marine fenders {{are used}} at ports and docks on quay walls and other {{berthing}} structures. They absorb the kinetic {{energy of a}} berthing vessel and thus prevent damage to the vessel or the berthing structure. There are 2 major categories of fenders for port applications: Fixed and <b>Floating.</b> Fixed <b>fenders</b> are mounted to the berth structure and compose of buckling fenders such as cell fenders, V-type fenders, and non-buckling fenders such as cylindrical <b>fenders.</b> <b>Floating</b> <b>fenders</b> are placed between the berth structure and ship, and include pneumatic fenders and foam-filled fenders.|$|R

50|$|The Mustang was {{the last}} of the <b>Fender</b> <b>floating</b> bridge models to be withdrawn, and the first to be reissued. Mustangs have {{maintained}} a popular following in Japan.|$|R
50|$|The Mustang {{introduced}} the Fender Dynamic Vibrato tailpiece, which {{together with a}} floating bridge forms the Mustang vibrato system. The floating bridge concept is common to the <b>Fender</b> <b>floating</b> vibrato developed for the Jazzmaster, but on the Mustang the saddles have only a single string slot, while on other Fender guitars there are multiple slots to allow limited adjustment of the string spacing.|$|R
50|$|It has a {{fixed bridge}} {{rather than the}} <b>Fender</b> <b>{{floating}}</b> tremolo used on the Bass VI and nearly all other Jaguar models. Of the Jaguar range, only the Baritone Custom, its Japan-only variant the Fender Bottom Master, the Fender Jaguar Baritone Special HH and some models of the Fender Jaguar Special HH lack the floating tremolo. All of these have separate and similar belly-mounted bridges and tailpieces.|$|R
50|$|The Fender VI was {{released}} in 1961 and followed {{the concept of the}} Danelectro six-string bass released in 1956, having six strings tuned E to E, an octave below the Spanish guitar. The Bass VI was closely related to the Fender Jaguar, with which it shared styling and technical details, notably the <b>Fender</b> <b>floating</b> tremolo. The VI had an offset body similar but not identical to that of the Jazzmaster/Jaguar.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Fender</b> <b>floating</b> tremolo also {{features}} a knob that enables the player to lock and thus disable the tremolo mechanism, allowing quick recovery of tuning {{in the event of}} breaking one string, and providing tuning stability with the mechanism locked that was intended to be similar to that of a fixed bridge guitar. In practice, this stability was not generally achieved, leading some players to replace the mechanism with a fixed bridge and tailpiece to produce a high quality [...] "hard-tail" [...] solid body guitar not otherwise available at the time. The [...] "floating tremolo" [...] was greatly favored by some surf music bands, particularly for its ability to produce a pronounced and distinctive vibrato on a sustained chord without disturbing the tuning of the guitar. To fully achieve this benefit however, correct setup, as per Fender's recommendations, was essential.|$|R
5000|$|The Dynamic Vibrato {{is often}} {{confused}} with the <b>Fender</b> <b>floating</b> tremolo, which it resembles. The original production runs of the two overlap {{by more than a}} decade, but the mechanisms are quite different. The existence of a few 1960s Mustangs factory fitted with the floating tremolo has probably added to the confusion. The concealed mechanism is in a chamber of a completely different shape and position, requiring an impractical amount of woodwork to convert from one to the other, and the mounting plate is of a different shape with different mounting holes.The string tension is balanced against two medium length helical springs under tension, mounted {{on the underside of the}} tremolo mounting plate, one attached to each of the two feet of the tailpiece bar. Dynamic Vibrato units may be recognized by the integrated floating bridge and the stamps [...] "Fender" [...] and [...] "DYNAMIC VIBRATO". Many but not all units also have the words [...] "PAT PEND" [...] or [...] "PAT. NO. 3,241,418" [...] stamped under the word [...] "Fender". The Dynamic Vibrato was the last of the floating bridge designs to be discontinued by Fender, with the Mustang in 1982, and the first to be reintroduced, again with the Mustang, in 1990.|$|R
5000|$|Semie Moseley {{developed}} the vibrato unit used on his Mosrite guitars from the basic {{concept of the}} Bigsby vibrato, but with many engineering improvements. The entire vibrato unit is top mounted. The strings feed through six holes in the upright plate {{at the rear of}} the unit (somewhat similar to the <b>Fender</b> <b>Floating</b> Trem) and the bridge is also rigidly mounted. But the string saddles are vertically mounted grooved [...] "wheels" [...] that roll with the string during vibrato usage, and also make palm muting very easy to achieve. Moseley advertised the unit as the [...] "feather touch" [...] vibrato, and the touch is exceptionally light with all but heavy gauge strings. Pitch stability is excellent. Moseley made several designs of the unit, the first being sand cast, with early versions having an attached string mute beneath the bridge (much like the Fender Jaguar) and a rather short handle. This he called the [...] "Vibramute". Two years later, he slightly simplified the design, going to a die cast design, eliminating the mute (which more players complained about than favored) and lengthening the vibrato arm slightly. This incarnation, called the [...] "Moseley", was used on all Mosrite guitars from that point on. The actual feel and response of the two different models is virtually identical, however. Moseley also designed a companion 12-string vibrato for the 12-string version of the instrument, and this may have been one of the only [...] - [...] if not the only [...] - [...] vibratos designed for use on a 12-string guitar.|$|R
