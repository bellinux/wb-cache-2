The SAG responded by opening the {{standard}} effort to any competing design, but of the many proposals, only Oracle Corp had a system that presented serious competition. In the end, SQLC won the votes and became the <b>draft</b> <b>standard,</b> but only after large portions of the API were removed – the standards document was trimmed from 120 pages to 50 during this time. It was also during this period that the name Call Level Interface was formally adopted. [...] In 1995 SQL/CLI became part of the international SQL standard, ISO/IEC 9075-3. The SAG itself was taken over by the X/Open group in 1996, and, over time, became part of The Open Group's Common Application Environment.|$|E

40|$|In the 1930 s, Harvard {{professor}} Erwin Griswold famously {{complained about}} the enormous numbers of New Deal regulations that were obscurely published on individual sheets or in “separate paper pamphlets. ” Finding these binding federal rules was difficult, leading to “chaos” and an “intolerable” situation. Congress responded, requiring that agencies publish all rules in the Federal Register and in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Currently, recent federal public laws, the entire U. S. Code, the Federal Register, and the CFR are all freely available online {{as well as in}} governmental depository libraries. But with respect to thousands of federal regulations, the clock has been turned back—and worse. To save resources and build on private expertise, federal agencies have incorporated privately <b>drafted</b> <b>standards</b> into numerous federal regulations, but only by “reference. ” These standards range widely. The CFR presently contains nearly 9, 500 “incorporations by reference” of standards, often referred to as “IBR” rules. Many IBR rules incorporate privately <b>drafted</b> <b>standards</b> from so-called “standards development organizations” or “SDOs. ” Agency use of IBR rules is likely to grow. Since the 1990 s, both executive branch and congressional policies have officially encouraged agency use of privately <b>drafted</b> <b>standards...</b>|$|R
