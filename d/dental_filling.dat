Materials and methods: Fifty-two individuals (32 female and 20 male) participated in the research study. Saliva samples were collected in scheduled time intervals and MDA, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase levels were measured. In addition, saliva samples were collected in order to quantify triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, bisphenol-A diglycidyl methacrylate, and urethane dimethacrylate using high-performance liquid chromatography. Statistical analysis of obtained data was performed by repeated measures variance analysis. A P value < 0. 05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: As {{a result of the}} statistical analysis, the MDA and glutathione peroxidase levels measured at all time intervals were significantly higher when compared to the baseline levels (P <  0. 05). Superoxide dismutase values measured after 7 days showed a statistically significant decrease (P <  0. 001). The residual monomer levels showed a significant increase within 7 days, and the maximum amount of release was observed generally in the 7 -day period, and the release in monomers except for bisphenol-A diglycidyl methacrylate showed a significant decrease in 30 days (P <  0. 05).

50|$|A dental {{restoration}} or <b>dental</b> <b>filling</b> is a dental restorative material used {{to restore the}} function, integrity and morphology of missing tooth structure. The structural loss typically results from caries or external trauma. Food stuck in teeth activate bacteria in the mouth {{to turn them into}} acids. The acids, food, and bacteria all combine to make what is called plaque. Plaque stubbornly clings to teeth and eats away at tooth enamel causing decay and cavities. Tooth decay is what will cause cavities; this decay can effect the enamel, the outer layer of the tooth, and dentin, the inner layer. It is also lost intentionally during tooth preparation to improve the aesthetics or the physical integrity of the intended restorative material. Dental restoration also refers to the replacement of missing tooth structure that is supported by dental implants.|$|E

The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) has yielded evidence of dentistry being practised as far back as 7000 BC.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Secondary caries are {{considered}} {{the main cause of}} dental restoration failure. In this context, anti-biofilm and bactericidal properties are desired in dental materials against pathogens such as Streptococcus mutans. To this purpose, graphene based materials can be used as fillers of polymer dental adhesives. In this work, we investigated the possibility to use as filler of dental adhesives, graphene nanoplatelets (GNP), a non toxic hydrophobic nanomaterial with antimicrobial and anti-biofilm properties. RESULTS: Graphene nanoplatelets have been produced starting from graphite intercalated compounds through a process consisting of thermal expansion and liquid exfoliation. Then, a <b>dental</b> adhesive <b>filled</b> with GNPs at different volume fractions has been produced through a solvent evaporation method. The rheological properties of the new experimental adhesives have been assessed experimentally. The adhesive properties have been tested using microtensile bond strength measurements (µ-TBS). Biocidal activity has been studied using the colony forming units count (CFU) method. The anti-biofilm properties have been demonstrated through FE-SEM imaging of the biofilm development after 3 and 24 h of growth. CONCLUSIONS: A significantly lower vitality of S. mutans cells has been demonstrated when in contact with the GNP <b>filled</b> <b>dental</b> adhesives. Biofilm growth on adhesive-covered dentine tissues demonstrated anti-adhesion properties of the produced materials. µ-TBS results demonstrated no significant difference in µ-TBS between the experimental and the control adhesive.

50|$|Resin {{sealants}} {{require an}} phosphoric acid solution ("etch") to create microscopic porosity {{into which the}} sealant material can flow thereby increasing retention, increasing surface area and improving {{the strength of the}} bond between the sealant and the tooth surface. Etching time varies from 15-60 second depending on the product. After that, the tooth must be rinsed and dried thoroughly for 15-20 seconds. Chalky appearance on the dried tooth means the tooth has been properly etched. If the tooth does not have this chalky appearance, the etching process must be repeated. The sealant is then applied to the tooth and either set with a curing light or left to dry by itself. Compared to a typical <b>dental</b> <b>filling,</b> where an injection of local anesthetic and use of a dental drill may be involved, fissure sealants are quick and painless. The sealant material is carefully placed into the prepared pits and fissures by using a disposable instrument provided by the manufacturer. Overfilling on the tooth should be prevented to minimize occlusal adjustment. The material is left for 10 seconds after the placement prior to curing to allow optimum penetration of the sealant materials into the pores created by the etching procedure. Usually, curing is 20-30 seconds. Glass ionomer do not require light curing, however they will set faster with the usage of a curing light.|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} analyse reliance on different forms of social security benefits by patients who attribute their poor health to <b>dental</b> <b>filling</b> materials. Methods A longitudinal cohort study with a 13 -year follow up. The subjects included were 505 patients attributing their ill health to dental restorative materials, who applied for subsidised filling replacement. They were compared to a cohort of matched controls representing the general population (three controls per patient). Annual individual data on disability pension, sick leave, unemployment benefits, and socio-demographic factors was obtained from Statistics Sweden. Generalized estimating equations were used to test for differences between cohorts in number of days on different types of social security benefits. Results The cohort of <b>dental</b> <b>filling</b> patients had a significantly higher number of days on sick leave and disability pension than the general population. The test of an overall interaction effect between time and cohort showed a significant difference between the two cohorts regarding both sick leave and disability pension. In the replacement cohort, the highest number of sick-leave days was recorded in the year they applied for subsidised replacement of fillings. While sick leave decreased following the year of application, the number of days on disability pension increased and peaked at the end of follow-up.
