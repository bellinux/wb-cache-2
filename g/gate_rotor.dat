The tooth surface equation of the screw rotor is deduced through using the tooth surface equation of the <b>gate</b> <b>rotor</b> and transform matrix depending on conjugated theory, the contact line equation is moreover acquired. The calculation formula of inducing method curvature is deduced, the inducing method curvature of some points on contact line with the rotation degree of the <b>gate</b> <b>rotor</b> changing is calculated.

40|$|In {{order to}} have fault {{identification}} for the <b>gate</b> <b>rotor</b> shaft with multiple cracks effectively, the quantity identification method of the <b>gate</b> <b>rotor</b> shaft with multiple cracks based on wavelet finite element method is established and the frequency test of the <b>gate</b> <b>rotor</b> shaft based on blind source separation algorithm is analyzed. Firstly the wavelet finite element was established by combining the Daubechies wavelet theory and the traditional finite element theory and then the vibration equations of intact and cracked wavelet finite element were obtained, which were applied to compute the changing rate of the natural frequencies for the cracked <b>gate</b> <b>rotor</b> shaft. Then natural frequencies fitting curve surface of the cracked <b>gate</b> <b>rotor</b> shaft with were acquired based on the wavelet finite {{element method and the}} identification procedure of the cracks was confirmed and the <b>gate</b> <b>rotor</b> shaft with two different cracks was analyzed and the results showed that the wavelet finite element could predict the multi-cracks correctly...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The <b>gate</b> <b>rotor</b> was a {{main part}} of the single screw compressor. In order to study the {{vibration}} characteristics of the <b>gate</b> <b>rotor,</b> wavelet finite element was used to have vibration analysis for it. The Daubechies wavelet plate element was used for meshing depending on transverse deforming theory. The Daubechies wavelet plate element was established by using Daubechies wavelet as shape function, and the finite elment formulation was deduced finally. The top six natural frequencies and mode shapes of the <b>gate</b> <b>rotor</b> were acquired. The results were close to that calculated by ANSYS software. And the correctness of wavelet finite element method was verified.

40|$|It is {{possible}} to design cylindrical helical gearing profiles such that an externally lobed inner gear rotates inside an internally lobed outer gear while maintaining continuous lines of contact between the gears. The continuous contact between {{the inner and outer}} rotors (analogous to the main and <b>gate</b> <b>rotors</b> in a conventional screw machine) creates a series of separate working chambers. In this type of machine the rotors have parallel axes of rotation, and if both rotors are free to rotate about their own axes, these axes can be fixed in space. The use of ported end plates is proposed to control the period during which fluid is allowed to enter or leave the working chambers of the internally geared screw machine. As with conventional screw machines, these internally geared rotors can then be used to achieve compression or expansion of a trapped mass of fluid, and the machine geometry can be designed in order to optimise performance for particular applications. This paper describes the geometrical analysis of some simple rotor profiles and explores the effect on rotor torques for particular applications of this novel screw configuration...|$|R
40|$|Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) of screw {{compressors}} is challenging {{due to the}} positive displacement nature of the process, existence of very fine fluid leakage paths, coexistence of working fluid and lubricant or coolant, fluid injection and most importantly the lack of methodologies available to generate meshes required for the full three dimensional transient simulations. In this paper, currently available technology of grid remeshing {{has been used to}} demonstrate the CFD simulations of complex multi rotor {{screw compressors}} like the twin screw compressor with parallel axis and single screw compressor with cylindrical main rotor and two planar <b>gate</b> <b>rotors</b> with perpendicular axis. Presently, methodology for grid generation of constant pitch twin screw machines is available through SCORG© (Kovacevic et al., 2007) but it is currently not suitable for different topologies like that of a single screw or variable pitch rotors. It is very challenging to handle the mesh deformation that happens in the compression chambers during operations of such machines. The methodology tested for this paper uses a technique called key-frame re-meshing in order to supply pre-generated grids to the CFD solver as the solution progresses. In order to evaluate accuracy of such approach, an adiabatic compression-expansion process in a reciprocating piston cylinder arrangement is studied and compared with a diffusion equation based mesh smoothing. It has been demonstrated, that although it is possible to simulate the complex configuration of screw compressors by key-frame re-meshing technique, there are many limitations with respect to the time consumed in pre-processing, demand to computational resources, accuracy of results and general difficulty to include advanced modeling features like turbulence, multispecies or multiphase flows. Hence it was concluded that customized tools for generation of CFD grids for such complex screw machines still remain to be developed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{a method}} is {{proposed}} for determining a basic prole of a cc-type single-screw compressor including the <b>gate</b> <b>rotor</b> and the screw rotor. The cc-type has a cylindrical screw and two cylindrical gate rotors. Based on this method, {{a mathematical model}} of the meshing principles of a cc-type screw rotor meshed with a <b>gate</b> <b>rotor,</b> that has either straight edge teeth or conical teeth, is presented. The inverse envelope concept is {{used to determine the}} cutting-edge curve of a <b>gate</b> <b>rotor.</b> Based on this concept, the required cutter for machining a cc-type screw rotor can be obtained by the envelope of a one-parameter family. The obtained screw rotor is an envelope to the family of the <b>gate</b> <b>rotor</b> ’ s surfaces. The obtained envelope becomes the generating surface. The inverse envelope can be used to obtain the envelope to the family of generating surfaces. Then the prole of a <b>gate</b> <b>rotor</b> cutting-edge curve can be easily obtained. The surface analysis including contact lines is shown for the design and manufacture of a screw compressor. As an example, the cc-type single-screw compressor with a compressor ratio of 11 : 6 was determined with the aid of the proposed mathematical model. Using rapid prototyping (RP) and manufacturing technology, a cc-type single-screw rotor with a <b>gate</b> <b>rotor</b> was designed. The RP primitives provide an actual full-size physical model that can be analysed and used for further development. Results from these mathematical models should have applications in the design of cc-type single-screw compressors...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{the process}} of shell design of a 100 kW single screw expander, the {{fundamental}} research on the screw chamber walls thickness is still lacking. Thin wall may cause deformation and the damage possibility of the inlet passage. Thick wall will increase {{the weight of the}} expander and led to assembly problem and transportation inconvenience. In this paper, static finite element analysis on cast shell of the 100 kW single screw expander was carried out. By calculating stress distribution and deformation of the expander shell under 1. 5 times of the design pressure, the authors find the thickness of <b>gate</b> <b>rotor</b> chamber walls and inlet passage walls as 15 mm is acceptable, but the thickness of screw chamber walls should be at least 35 mm...|$|E
40|$|Single screw {{compressors}} {{are widely used}} in various industrial fields, however the performance usually drops obviously after thousands of hours of operation due to the wear between the star-wheel and the <b>gate</b> <b>rotor.</b> A lot of meshing pair profiles and manufacturing methods are proposed to solve this problem. Thus, good oil lubrication conditions are conducive to improve the wear resistance of the meshing pair so as to increase the compressorâ€˜s operation life. In this paper, the geometric models of the clearances for both profiles, a kind of multi-column profile and single-column profile for oil flooded compressors are carried out, and a mathematical lubrication model is used to analyses the oil lubrication. Results show that the torques caused by the oil film force {{on both sides of}} the star-wheel tooth are unbalanced. The total torques of the analyzed multi-column profile is smaller than that of the single column profile, which indicates a better lubrication condition. The analysis can also be used to optimize the profile design of the meshing pair of single {{screw compressors}}. ...|$|E
40|$|Thermodynamic {{models to}} {{simulate}} positive displacement compressors {{are well known}} for a few decades already and can describe the compressor performance quite well. One {{of the most complex}} part of the simulation process however is the positive displacement compressor geometry simulation. In the current context, under geometry simulation, values of working compressor volumes, as well as cross-sections of port openings, at different shaft (rotor) angles are considered. In the current paper, as an example, the Greene formula approach was applied to a geometry simulation of a single screw compressor. Working chamber geometry was defined by “cutting “ it with the <b>gate</b> <b>rotor</b> blade; flute volume was computed using Greene formula; suction and discharge ports were intersected with this volume so that port opening contours were defined and their respective cross sectional areas were calculated. The results of this geometry simulation were applied for a thermodynamic model of a single screw compressor. Experimental investigation of a single screw working process using pressure transducers has been conducted. Geometry simulation data was applied to calculate compression work from experimental pressure traces. Pressure-volume diagrams obtained experimentally were compared to the simulated ones. Also, indicator work obtained from simulation and experiment, was compared to the power input to the shaft, and demonstrated good correlation...|$|E
