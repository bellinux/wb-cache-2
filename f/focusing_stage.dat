40|$|Converging {{shock waves}} in solids are numerically {{simulated}} using the random choice method (RCM), {{which has been}} developed for gases. Initially, a Riemann solver for fluidlike solids with the Gruneisen-type equation of state is constructed. It is incorporated into the RCM, and {{is applied to the}} cylindrical shock tube problem in solid copper with a driving pressure of 20 GPa. Spacial distributions of pressure, density and particle velocity show that the steepness at the shock front is maintained both in the converging and reflecting stages. Numerical results are compared with those of the finite difference method (FDM), showing the superiority of RCM over FDM. It is shown that the pressure on the shock front and the total energy contained in the central circular area in the reflecting stage are much larger than those in the <b>focusing</b> <b>stage...</b>|$|E
40|$|Two {{research}} {{tasks are}} performed to achieve robust fabrication and uniform dynamic performance of complex piezoelectric micro-electromechanical systems: first, production of complex thin-film lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) microdevices requiring high-yield chip-level process robustness; second, design for feature-level parametric robustness that improves the finite-time dynamic performance uniformity of piezo-MEMS devices. Thin-film PZT actuators are integrated in a robust way with silicon microstructures via the latter’s encapsulation by vertical silicon dioxide barrier trenches. The process conserves piezoelectric performance with high actuator yield and supports multi-level structure fabrication. Two prototype devices that {{take advantage of}} this process to produce multiple-degree-of-freedom motions and large displacements with fast response times are characterized experimentally. For the first prototype, a micro-robotic leg joint, displacement modeling is performed that includes compensation for intrinsic residual stress of thin-film stacks, oxide barrier trench properties as they influence behavior of in-plane flexure joint arrays, and the stiffness of an electrical interconnect structure across compact actuator arrays. The modeling approach and empirical measurements show good agreement for multi-degree-of-freedom static displacements. For the second prototype, a vertical translational z-axis <b>focusing</b> <b>stage</b> for endoscopic microscopes, the fabrication process allows backside etching to release stages actuated by multi-fold thin-film PZT vertical actuators. Motion generated by the proposed vertical translational z-axis <b>focusing</b> <b>stage</b> is targeted up to 200 micron, and the transient response of two-fold stage is shown and found to be faster than other existing actuation mechanism of endoscopic micro-mirror platform. For design of robust finite-time transient response of piezoelectric MEMS devices the maximum perturbed finite-time transient behavior of the system is represented by the spectral radius of a compact matrix. This allows efficient optimization of the worst-case scenario for perturbed finite-time transient response. In case studies, locally optimal structural parameters of piezoelectric micro-electromechanical systems were obtained. Using mu-synthesis analysis, the maximum perturbation is estimated systematically when compared to randomly generated samples, which may not guarantee the maximum perturbed finite-time transient response...|$|E
40|$|A {{corrugated}} spline-profile horn {{has been}} designed to meet the stringent specifications and constraints of a receiver for Band 1 (31. 3 – 45 GHz) of the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). Given the physical restrictions of the receiver, the horn will be located behind a focusing lens placed 191 mm over its aperture. After this first <b>focusing</b> <b>stage,</b> the horn must have a reflection coefficient less than − 20 dB and the cross-polarization not exceeding the − 30 dB level in the entire frequency range. The side-lobes should be less than − 25 dB at all frequencies and its half power beamwidth must be approximately 24 ◦ at 31. 3 GHz and 16 ◦ at 45 GHz. The horn has been constructed using the split-block technique and characterized in a near-field scanner setup. The results show an excellent performance complying with all the requirements.

40|$|Adhesion and {{friction}} during {{physical contact}} of solid components in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) {{often lead to}} device failure. Translational stages that are fabricated with traditional silicon MEMS typically face these tribological concerns. This work addresses these concerns by developing a MEMS vertical translation, or <b>focusing,</b> <b>stage</b> that uses electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) as the actuating mechanism. EWOD {{has the potential to}} eliminate solid-solid contact by actuating through deformation of liquid droplets placed between the stage and base to achieve stage displacement. Our EWOD stage is capable of linear spatial manipulation with resolution of 10 [*]μm over a maximum range of 130 [*]μm and angular deflection of approximately ± 1 °, comparable to piezoelectric actuators. We also developed a model that suggests a higher intrinsic contact angle on the EWOD surface can further improve the translational range, which was validated experimentally by comparing different surface coatings. The capability to operate the stage without solid-solid contact offers potential improvements for applications in micro-optics, actuators, and other MEMS devices. United States.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to the {{modeling}} and simulation of Asymmetric Flow Field Flow Fractionation, which is a technique for separating particles of submicron scale. This process is a part of large family of Field Flow Fractionation techniques and has a very broad range of industrial applications, e. g. in microbiology, chemistry, pharmaceutics, environmental analysis. Mathematical modeling is crucial for this process, as due to the own nature of the process, lab ex- periments are difficult and expensive to perform. On the other hand, there are several challenges for the mathematical modeling: huge dominance (up to 106 times) of the flow over the diffusion, highly stretched geometry of the device. This work {{is devoted to}} developing fast and efficient algorithms, which take into the account the challenges, posed by the application, and provide reliable approximations for the quantities of interest. We present a new Multilevel Monte Carlo method for estimating the distribution functions on a compact interval, which are of the main interest for Asymmetric Flow Field Flow Fractionation. Error estimates for this method in terms of computational cost are also derived. We optimize the flow control at the <b>Focusing</b> <b>stage</b> under the given constraints on the flow and present an important ingredients for the further optimization, such as two-grid Reduced Basis method, specially adapted for the Finite Volume discretization approach...|$|E
40|$|Sandia National Laboratories has {{conducted}} research in chemical sensing {{and analysis of}} explosives for many years. Recently, that experience has been directed towards detecting mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO) by sensing the low-level explosive signatures associated with these objects. The authors {{focus has been on}} the classification of UXO in shallow water and anti-personnel/anti tank mines on land. The objective of this work is to develop a field portable chemical sensing system which can be used to examine mine-like objects (MLO) to determine whether there are explosive molecules associated with the MLO. Two sampling subsystems have been designed, one for water collection and one for soil/vapor sampling. The water sampler utilizes a flow-through chemical adsorbent canister to extract and concentrate the explosive molecules. Explosive molecules are thermally desorbed from the concentrator and trapped in a <b>focusing</b> <b>stage</b> for rapid desorption into an ion-mobility spectrometer (IMS). The authors describe a prototype system which consists of a sampler, concentrator-focuser, and detector. The soil sampler employs a light-weight probe for extracting and concentrating explosive vapor from the soil in the vicinity of an MLO. The chemical sensing system is capable of sub-part-per-billion detection of TNT and related explosive munition compounds. They present the results of field and laboratory tests on buried landmines which demonstrate their ability to detect the explosive signatures associated with these objects...|$|E

40|$|A novel design {{based on}} {{electric}} field-free open microwell arrays for the automated continuous-flow sorting of single or small clusters of cells is presented. The main {{feature of the}} proposed device is the parallel analysis of cell-cell and cell-particle interactions in each microwell of the array. High throughput sample recovery with a fast and separate transfer from the microsites to standard microtiter plates is also possible thanks to the {{flexible printed circuit board}} technology which permits to produce cost effective large area arrays featuring geometries compatible with laboratory equipment. The particle isolation is performed via negative dielectrophoretic forces which convey the particles’ into the microwells. Particles such as cells and beads flow in electrically active microchannels on whose substrate the electrodes are patterned. The introduction of particles within the microwells is automatically performed by generating the required feedback signal by a microscope-based optical counting and detection routine. In order to isolate a controlled number of particles we created two particular configurations of the electric field within the structure. The first one permits their isolation whereas the second one creates a net force which repels the particles from the microwell entrance. To increase the parallelism at which the cell-isolation function is implemented, a new technique based on coplanar electrodes to detect particle presence was implemented. A lock-in amplifying scheme was used to monitor the impedance of the channel perturbed by flowing particles in high-conductivity suspension mediums. The impedance measurement module was also combined with the dielectrophoretic <b>focusing</b> <b>stage</b> situated upstream of the measurement stage, to limit the measured signal amplitude dispersion due to the particles position variation within the microchannel. In conclusion, the designed system complies with the initial specifications making it suitable for cellomics and biotechnology applications. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we report the {{production}} of a Cesium atomic beam by means of laser cooling techniques and its photoionization, in order to evaluate its applicative potential for specific technological purposes. A comprehensive analysis of the atomic beam is carried out, based on a variety of diagnostics, such as fluorescence imaging at different distances from the pyramidal-MOT, absorption spectroscopy, optical time-of-flight. The results demonstrate that the atomic beam owns peculiar dynamical properties, in particular in terms of longitudinal and transverse velocity distribution. The average value of the longitudinal velocity is on the order of ten m/s, with a spread on the order of m/s, accompanied by a few mrad divergence: such features motivate the names “slow” and “cold” we have attributed to our atomic beam. Thanks to them, the beam can find applications where sources of particles with controlled and rather homogeneous dynamical properties are required. The main motivation behind photoionization of the Cesium beam was to set the basis for exploring the capabilities of the slow and cold beam in producing an ion beam. This part of the research was carried out within the frame of a European industry-oriented collaboration (FP 7 -MC-IAPP Project ”COLDBEAMS”) aimed at exploiting laser manipulation tools for the realization of unconventional charged particle beams with superior dynamical properties. The technology presently used for instance in FIB columns is in fact based on beams with “thermal” velocity distribution, that leads to non-monochromatic samples severely suffering chromatic aberration in the <b>focusing</b> <b>stage.</b> To this aim, a two-colour photoionization scheme has been implemented, involving resonant excitation of Cesium 6 P atoms and interaction with 405 nm photons. Photoionization was demonstrated and the rate estimated on the order of about 3 · 10 ^ 6 s^(− 1). The corresponding ion current is on the order of 0. 5 pA. A preliminary insight into the dynamical properties of the ion beam has been given by ion time-of-flight measurements upon pulsed laser ionization. Interpretation of the results required a careful description of the electric fields in the collection region, which, while not being optimized by design for this specific purpose, were numerically simulated. The results demonstrate that, owing to the peculiar features of the neutral atom beam, the ions exhibit a rather monochromatic longitudinal energy distribution, with a monochromaticity essentially limited {{by the size of the}} ionizing laser beam and by the weak collection field. Such properties are comparable to those of the ion sources used at present...|$|E
