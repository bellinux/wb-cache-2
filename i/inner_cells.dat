5|$|Tbr1 is {{expressed}} mainly in early-born postmitotic neurons {{of the developing}} cerebral cortex—in particular, the preplate and layer VI neurons. The preplate forms the architectural network of neurons that help developing neurons migrate. Successive migrations of neurons divide the preplate such that its <b>inner</b> <b>cells</b> form the cortical plate while its outer cells form the marginal zone. The cortical plate and the marginal zone eventually develop into six cortical layers, known as the neocortex, present in the mature cerebral cortex. These layers are numbered I-VI with layer VI being the deepest and forming first, while the remaining layers grow outward from it (from V to I). Layers II-VI develop from the cortical plate and layer I forms from the marginal zone. The subplate, intermediate zone, subventricular zone, and ventricular zone are found progressively deeper to these developing cortical layers. High expression of Tbr1 {{is seen in the}} marginal zone, cortical plate, and subplate of the developing cortex whereas little expression is seen in the subventricular zone. No Tbr1 expression has been observed in the ventricular zone.|$|E
5|$|The {{manner in}} which the puffball splits open (dehisces) has been {{described}} by 19th-century American mycologist William Henry Long. The thick and leathery peridium of the mature puffball remains unopened for several months without splitting. After several alternating cycles of wetting and drying, fissures develop across the top. These fissures usually radiate from a common center {{near the top of the}} fruit body and finally produce very irregular star-like teeth. In time, the entire upper half of the puffball is open and exposed during dry weather. In this condition, the spores are blown out by the wind and widely distributed. During every rainy spell the puffball promptly closes only to open again when dry weather returns. At each alternate opening and closing the peridium is split more and more, until finally it is expanded into a flat shape, or even curls backward. In the puffball, the outer layer of the peridium comprises cells arranged so that when wet they adsorb water and expand, thus closing the top of the puffball. Upon drying, these outer cells lose water and gradually shrink, thus producing an unequal tension between the outer and <b>inner</b> <b>cells</b> of the peridium. This tension causes the irregular star-like pieces of the peridium to gradually separate and curve outward, thus opening the top of the puffball during dry weather.|$|E

60|$|On the Power of Absorption {{possessed by}} the Glands.--It has already been {{indirectly}} shown that the glands on pedicels absorb animal matter; and this is further shown by their changed colour, and by the aggregation of their contents, {{after they have been}} left in contact with nitrogenous substances or liquids. The following observations apply both to the glands supported on [page 338] pedicels and to the minute sessile ones. Before a gland has been in any way stimulated, the exterior cells commonly contain only limpid purple fluid; the more central ones including mulberry-like masses of purple granular matter. A leaf was placed in a little solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 146 of water (3 grs. to 1 oz.), and the glands were instantly darkened and very soon became black; this change being due to the strongly marked aggregation of their contents, more especially of the <b>inner</b> <b>cells.</b> Another leaf was placed in a solution of the same strength of nitrate of ammonia, and the glands were slightly darkened in 25 m., more so in 50 m., and after 1 hr. 30 m. were of so dark a red as to appear almost black. Other leaves were placed in a weak infusion of raw meat and in human saliva, and the glands were much darkened in 25 m., and after 40 m. were so dark as almost to deserve to be called black. Even immersion for a whole day in distilled water occasionally induces some aggregation within the glands, so that they become of a darker tint. In all these cases the glands are affected in exactly the same manner as those of Drosera. Milk, however, which acts so energetically on Drosera, seems rather less effective on Drosophyllum, for the glands were only slightly darkened by an immersion of 1 hr. 20 m., but became decidedly darker after 3 hrs. Leaves which had been left for 7 hrs. in an infusion of raw meat or in saliva were placed in the solution of carbonate of ammonia, and the glands now became greenish; whereas, if they had been first placed in the carbonate, they would have become black. In this latter case, the ammonia probably combines with the acid of the secretion, and therefore does not act on the colouring matter; but when the glands are first subjected to an organic [page 339] fluid, either the acid is consumed in the work of digestion or the cell-walls are rendered more permeable, so that the undecomposed carbonate enters and acts on the colouring matter. If a particle of the dry carbonate is placed on a gland, the purple colour is quickly discharged, owing probably to an excess of the salt. The gland, moreover, is killed.|$|E
6000|$|From the thallus of a sea-weed up to {{the leaf}} of a highly {{developed}} phænogam, we find, at all stages, a contrast between {{the inner and outer}} parts of these flattened masses of tissue. In the higher Algæ [...] "the outermost layers consist of smaller and firmer cells, while the <b>inner</b> <b>cells</b> are often very large, and sometimes extremely long;"[51] and in the leaves of trees the epidermal layer, besides differing in the sizes and shapes of its component cells from the parenchyma forming the inner substance of the leaf, is itself differentiated by having a continuous cuticle, and by having the outer walls of its cells unlike the inner walls.[52] Especially significant is the structure of such intermediate types as the Liverworts. Beyond the differentiation of the covering cells from the contained cells, and the contrast between upper surface and under surface, the frond of Marchantia polymorpha clearly shows us the direct effect of incident forces; and shows us, too, how it is involved with the effect of inherited proclivities. The frond grows from a flat disc-shaped gemma, the two sides of which are alike. Either side may fall uppermost; and then of the developing shoot, the side exposed to the light [...] "is under all circumstances the upper side which forms stomata, the dark side becomes the under side which produces root-hairs and leafy processes."[53] So that while we have undeniable proof that the contrasted influences of the medium on the two sides, initiate the differentiation, we have also proof that the completion of it is determined by the transmitted structure of the type; since it is impossible to ascribe the development of stomata to the direct action of air and light. On turning from foliar expansions, to stems and roots, facts of like meaning meet us. Speaking generally of epidermal tissue and inner tissue, Sachs remarks that [...] "the contrast of the two is the plainer the more the part of the plant concerned is exposed to air and light."[54] Elsewhere, in correspondence with this, it is said that in roots the cells of the epidermis, though distinguished by bearing hairs, [...] "are otherwise {{similar to those of the}} fundamental tissue" [...] which they clothe,[55] while the cuticular covering is relatively thin; whereas in stems the epidermis (often further differentiated) is composed of layers of cells which are smaller and thicker-walled: a stronger contrast of structure corresponding to a stronger contrast of conditions. By way of meeting the suggestion that these respective differences are wholly due to the natural selection of favourable variations, it will suffice if I draw attention to the unlikeness between imbedded roots and exposed roots. While in darkness, and surrounded by moist earth, the outermost protective coats, even of large roots, are comparatively thin; but when the accidents of growth entail permanent exposure to light and air, roots acquire coverings allied in character to the coverings of branches. That the action of the medium causes these and converse changes, cannot be doubted when we find, on the one hand, that [...] "roots can become directly transformed into leaf-bearing shoots," [...] and, on the other hand, that in some plants certain [...] "apparent roots are only underground shoots," [...] and that nevertheless [...] "they are similar to true roots in function and in the formation of tissue, but have no root-cap, and, when they come to the light above ground, continue to grow in the manner of ordinary leaf-shoots."[56] If, then, in highly developed plants inheriting pronounced structures, this differentiating influence of the medium is so marked, it must have been all-important at the outset while types were undetermined.|$|E

Expression of vimentin was first detected in the <b>inner</b> <b>cell</b> mass of about 50 % of the 9 -day-old embryos. In elongated 11 - day-old embryos, cells expressing vimentin were observed in the epiblast (after disappearance of Rauber's membrane) and in cells migrating from the epiblast between the trophoblast and the underlying hypoblast layer. A keratin-positive response was observed in trophectoderm cells at all stages.

50|$|In position-dependent Hippo signaling, {{where the}} outer and <b>inner</b> <b>cells</b> are polar and nonpolar respectively, AMOT and AMOTL2 are {{essential}} for Hippo pathway activation and appropriate cell fate specification. In the nonpolar <b>inner</b> <b>cells,</b> AMOT localizes to adherens junctions (AJs), and Ser-176 at the N-terminal domain is phosphorylated by LATS downstream of GPCR signaling, which inhibits actin binding activity and stabilizes the AMOT-LATS interaction to activate the Hippo pathway. Thus, AMOT is a direct substrate of LATS and its phosphorylation at Ser-176 inhibits cell migration and angiogenesis. In the outer cells, the cell polarity sequesters AMOT from basolateral adherens junctions to apical domains, thereby suppressing Hippo signaling. It is therefore proposed AMOT acts as a molecular switch for Hippo pathway and links F-actin with LATS activity.|$|E

50|$|Studies {{reveal that}} {{positioning}} {{of male and}} female progeny in the nest is strategic and that cell size {{plays a major role in}} the size of progeny, independent of the mother's size. Females have been observed to lay female eggs in the <b>inner</b> <b>cells</b> and male eggs in the outer cells. With respect to sex ratios, larger cell provisions are correlated with a greater production of female offspring. Two explanations exist for these behaviors in terms of mother's foraging behaviors: 1) The mother brings more provisions to the <b>inner</b> <b>cells</b> because she expects that female progeny will be produced there and 2) the mother chooses to fertilize her egg, and therefore promotes the production of female progeny, because she has to bring larger provision proportions to a larger cell. The sex ratio changes depending on nest size, length, and nesting material. This ratio is controlled by the female. These observations have been made for females who make their nests in tunnels. For example, a 5.5 mm tunnel diameter is associated with a 3:1 ratio and a 6.0 mm tunnel diameter is associated with a 2:1 ratio of males to females. Shorter tunnels, those that are below 5.0 cm long, are less favorable.|$|E
