Pears's other Decca recordings range from early music by Dowland, Schütz and their contemporaries to Walton's Façade, and include such varied repertory as the Emperor in Puccini's Turandot, the title role in Stravinsky's Oedipus Rex, and the tenor part in Berlioz's L'enfance du Christ. His recordings for other companies include the Evangelist in Otto Klemperer's 1961 version of the St Matthew Passion, Fauré's La bonne chanson, and the tenor part in Bach's B minor Mass.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{relationship}} between smoking and schizophrenia is well established, a factor {{to be considered in}} this relationship <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tobacco industry. Research based on internal industry documents shows a concerted effort by the industry to promote belief that people with schizophrenia need to smoke and that it is dangerous for them to quit. Such promotion includes monitoring or supporting research that endorsed the idea that people with schizophrenia are uniquely immune to the health consequences of smoking (since proved false) and that tobacco is needed for people with schizophrenia to self-medicate. The industry also provided cigarettes to hospital wards and supported efforts to block hospital-based smoking bans. Although this does not discredit the effects of nicotine in schizophrenia, it is argued that the efforts of the tobacco industry slowed the decline in smoking prevalence in people with schizophrenia as well as the development of clinical policies to promote smoking cessation.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{multiplicity}} of names, there is often confusion {{as to what the}} PGA Tour organization does and does not run. Of the events in the PGA Tour schedule, it does not run any of the four major championships (the Masters Tournament, the U.S. Open, The Open Championship and the PGA Championship), or the Ryder Cup. The PGA of America, not the PGA Tour, runs the PGA Championship, the Senior PGA Championship, and co-organizes the Ryder Cup with Ryder Cup Europe, a company controlled by the PGA European Tour. Additionally, the PGA Tour is not involved with the women's golf tours in the U.S., which are mostly controlled by the LPGA. The PGA Tour is also not the governing body for the game of golf in the United States; this, instead, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States Golf Association (USGA), which organizes the U.S. Open. What the PGA Tour does organize are the remaining 43 (in 2009) week-to-week events, including The Players Championship and the FedEx Cup events, as well as the biennial Presidents Cup. It also runs the main tournaments on five other tours: PGA Tour Champions, the Web.com Tour, PGA Tour Canada, PGA Tour China, and PGA Tour Latinoamérica.|$|E

Depending upon one's political perspective, the Congressional investigation into the Iran–Contra affair was either an attempt by the legislative arm to gain control over an out-of-control executive arm, a partisan [...] "witch hunt" [...] by the Democrats against a Republican administration or a feeble effort by Congress that did far too little to rein in the [...] "imperial presidency" [...] that had run amok by breaking numerous laws. The Democratic-controlled United States Congress issued its own report on November 18, 1987, stating that [...] "If the president did not know what his national security advisers were doing, he should have". The congressional report wrote that the president bore [...] "ultimate responsibility" [...] for wrongdoing by his aides, and his administration exhibited [...] "secrecy, deception and disdain for the law". It also read that [...] "the central remaining question <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> President in the Iran–Contra affair.

500|$|In Singapore, {{the vital}} {{role that the}} {{judiciary}} plays as a check on executive power was noted by the Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze, which held that all power given by law has legal limits and that [...] "the rule of law demands that the courts {{should be able to}} examine the exercise of discretionary power". This is further illustrated by Law Society of Singapore v. Tan Guat Neo Phyllis (2008), in which it was stated that prosecutorial discretion is subject to judicial review and may be curtailed where exercised in bad faith or for extraneous purposes, or is in contravention of constitutional rights. In Chee Siok Chin v. Minister for Home Affairs (2005), the High Court held that if a litigant [...] "genuinely seek the court's assistance in vindicating or determining a legitimate grievance, the court has a duty to assess such a grievance and accord proper and serious consideration in determining whether relief should be granted". Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong has also said it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> courts in Singapore to give litigants their rights, whilst simultaneously playing a supporting role in the promotion of good governance through the articulation of clear rules and principles by which the executive can conform with the rule of law.

2500|$|Justice Hugo Black {{agreed with}} the {{majority}} that Rice’s increased sentence indicated that the state trial judge was motivated {{by a desire to}} punish Rice for appealing his original trial decision.

He was particularly concerned with the majority’s requirement that a trial judge affirmatively state the reasons for an increased sentence. [...] While he argued that impermissible motivations for increased trial sentences (such as in Rice’s case) are unconstitutional, he disagreed that it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Court—instead of the legislature—to impose a specific remedy of requiring a judge to affirmatively state his reasoning for justifying an increased sentence.|$|E
2500|$|Ommaya focused much of {{his career}} on the study of consciousness, the brain, and mind. This {{interest}} derived from his reading of Pennfield’s work on surgical treatment of epilepsy.

[...] Key to his observations <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> limbic system and emotion as foundational for consciousness. In his view, emotion is the trigger to action and other aspects of rationality are tools to justify action. Ommaya saw consciousness as an emergent property of the evolution of neural structures. Consciousness is the result of evolutionary forces directed to improving the efficiency of mental function. The reintegration of thought and action after traumatic injury provided the experimental context for Ommaya's thoughts.|$|E

2500|$|There is a {{wide variety}} in the styles of these predominately brick, {{and to a lesser}} degree, stone, and/or stone-faced, {{single-storey}} detached houses. After both of the World Wars, the use of red bricks was popular. In the 1960s, cream bricks became popular, and in the 1970s, deep red and brown bricks became popular. Until the 1970s, roofs tended to be clad with corrugated iron or clay tiles (usually red clay). Since then, cement tiles and colourbond corrugated (and other types of) iron have also become popular. Most roofs are pitched; flat roofs are not common. Up to the 1970s, the majority of houses were of [...] "double brick" [...] construction on concrete footings, with timber floors laid on joists supported by [...] "dwarf walls". Due to Adelaide's reactive soils (particularly Keswick Clay, black earth and some red-brown earth soils), since then houses have mainly been constructed of [...] "brick veneer" [...] over a timber frame (and more recently, over a light steel frame) on a concrete slab foundation.
