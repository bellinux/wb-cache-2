5|$|Gene {{duplication}} <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> that venom {{has become}} more diverse. There have been instances of new venom proteins generated by alternative splicing. The Elapid snake Bungarus fasciatus, for example, possesses a gene that is alternatively spliced to yield both a venom component and a physiological protein. Further diversification may have occurred by gene loss of specific venom components. For instance, the rattlesnake ancestor {{is believed to have}} had genes for neurotoxic PLA2 toxins, which are absent in modern non-neurotoxic Crotalus species. The various recruitment events had resulted in snake venom evolving into a very complex mixture of proteins. The venom of rattlesnakes, for example, includes nearly 40 different proteins from different protein families, and other snake venoms have been found to contain more than 100 distinct proteins. The composition of this mixture has been shown to vary geographically, and {{to be related to the}} prey species available in a certain region. Snake venom has generally evolved very quickly, with changes occurring faster in the venom than in the rest of the organism.|$|E

However, heterozygote advantage <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> a polymorphism can be maintained. Apostatic selection, whereby a predator consumes a common morph whilst overlooking rarer morphs is possible and does occur. This would tend to preserve rarer morphs from extinction.|$|E

25|$|The {{conformal}} latitude {{defines a}} transformation from the ellipsoid to a sphere of arbitrary radius {{such that the}} angle of intersection between any two lines on the ellipsoid {{is the same as}} the corresponding angle on the sphere (so that the shape of small elements is well preserved). A further conformal transformation from the sphere to the plane gives a conformal double projection from the ellipsoid to the plane. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> of generating such a conformal projection. For example, the 'exact' version of the Transverse Mercator projection on the ellipsoid is not a double projection. (It does, however, involve a generalisation of the conformal latitude to the complex plane).|$|E

25|$|The {{degree of}} Master of Arts {{traditionally}} carried various rights and privileges, {{the chief of}} which was membership of the legislative bodies of the universities – Convocation at Oxford and the Senate at Cambridge and Dublin. These were originally important decision-making bodies, approving changes to the statutes of the universities and electing various officials, including the two members of Parliament for each university. Inception to the MA degree was the principal way of becoming a member of these bodies, though it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way,</b> e.g. at Oxford Doctors of Divinity, Medicine and Civil Law were always also automatically members of Convocation. Today, the main role of Convocation and Senate is {{the election of the}} Chancellor of each university as well as the Professor of Poetry at Oxford and the High Steward at Cambridge.|$|E

2500|$|The {{mathematical}} analysis originated in {{observations of the}} behaviour of game equipment such as playing cards and dice, which are designed specifically to introduce random and equalized elements; in mathematical terms, they are subjects of indifference. [...] This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> probabilistic statements are used in ordinary human language: when people say that [...] "it will probably rain", they typically do {{not mean that the}} outcome of rain versus not-rain is a random factor that the odds currently favor; instead, such statements are perhaps better understood as qualifying their expectation of rain with a degree of confidence. [...] Likewise, when it is written that [...] "the most probable explanation" [...] of the name of Ludlow, Massachusetts [...] "is that it was named after Roger Ludlow", what is meant here is not that Roger Ludlow is favored by a random factor, but rather that this is the most plausible explanation of the evidence, which admits other, less likely explanations.|$|E
2500|$|Most “fresh” cheeses, unlike aged cheeses {{held for}} weeks or months, are aged for only days. This is {{not enough time to}} change the pH of the cheese to kill any harmful {{bacteria}} that may have been in the (unpasteurized) milk {{at the beginning of the}} process. The use of raw milk has led to a number of instances of food-borne disease linked to cheese, especially unaged, “fresh” cheeses. Cases of tuberculosis, listeriosis, and other diseases linked to cheese made in Mexico have led to strong restrictions against bringing the same across the US border or along with air travelers entering US airports. The most problematic cheeses have been panela, asadero, queso blanco, and ranchero, as these are not aged and are often made with unpasteurized milk. In 2008, the Diario [...] de la Federacion published the Norma [...] Mexicana project, with one of its purposes being the better sanitary control of the cheeses produced in the country. One of its major provisions is the prohibition against cheeses made with raw milk. However, critics state pasteurization <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> to guard against food-borne illnesses, and the process kills beneficial bacteria that affect the cheeses’ taste and health benefits of the cheese with the loss of live culture and enzymes. This is especially true of aged cheeses.|$|E
