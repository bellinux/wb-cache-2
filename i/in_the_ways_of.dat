5|$|A plain {{soldier and}} {{business}} man. I am no politician, nor have I {{any desire to}} be one. In {{the course of my}} commercial career it has been my fate to have had much experience of politicians and their ways. What I have seen in the course of that experience has given me little respect either for the professional politician or his methods. I am desirous of seeing this country governed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> clear common sense and good sound business principles, and I think that desire of mine is heartily share by {{the vast majority of the}} population.|$|E
5|$|King Rufus, {{the leader}} of a furry race of creatures called the Gobbos, is {{watching}} the sunrise over Gobbo Valley when he sees a large, woven basket carrying a baby crocodile floating down the river. Initially suspicious of the young crocodile but ultimately won over by its innocence, King Rufus and the Gobbos decide to raise it as one of their own and teach it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> the Gobbo. The crocodile, named Croc, grows, eventually becoming much larger than the Gobbos.|$|E

He has difficulty fitting in, but is tutored by his cousin, Madame de Beauséant, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> high society. Rastignac endears himself to one of Goriot's daughters, Delphine, after extracting money from his own already-poor family. Vautrin, meanwhile, tries to convince Rastignac to pursue an unmarried woman named Victorine, whose family fortune is blocked only by her brother. He offers {{to clear the way}} for Rastignac by having the brother killed in a duel.|$|E

5|$|The Lowell System {{combined}} large-scale mechanization with {{an attempt}} to improve the stature of its female workforce and workers. A few girls who came with their mothers or older sisters were as young as ten years old, some were middle-aged, but the average age was about 24. Usually hired for contracts of one year (the average stay was about four years), new employees were given assorted tasks as spare hands and paid a fixed daily wage while more experienced loom operators would be paid by the piece. They were paired with more experienced women, who trained them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> the factory.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{was among}} the first novels he {{released}} under his own name, Balzac did not use characters in La Peau de chagrin from previous works. He did, however, introduce several individuals who resurfaced in later stories. Most significant of these is Eugène de Rastignac, the older gentleman who tutors Valentin in the vicious ways of high society. Thirty pages into the writing of his 1834 novel Le Père Goriot, Balzac suddenly crossed out the name he had been using for a character– Massiac– and used Rastignac instead. The relationship between teacher and student in La Peau de chagrin is mirrored in Le Père Goriot, when the young Rastignac is guided <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> social realpolitik by the incognito criminal Vautrin.|$|E
5|$|Sultan did not {{initially}} have any male heirs {{and it is}} possible that Usama expected to succeed him. He certainly singled him out among his brothers by teaching him, tutoring him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> war and hunting. He even favoured him for personal missions and as a representative. However, after Sultan had his own son, he no longer appreciated the presence of Usama and Murshid's other sons. According to Usama, Sultan was jealous after a particularly successful lion-hunt in 1131 when he entered the town with a large lion head in his arms as a hunting trophy. When his grandmother saw this she warned him about the effect this could have on his uncle. However, despite this he still spoke well of his uncle on a few occasions in his autobiography and highlighted his noble actions. Usama ultimately left Shaizar temporarily in 1129 and after his father died in 1137 his exile became permanent.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{calls for}} European energy {{diversity}} being amplified {{as a result}} of the crisis, Russia's European customers have long term legal contracts for gas deliveries. Most of these contracts stretch beyond 2025–2030 and obligations to these contracts remain despite the crisis. Thus European countries can do little in the short-medium term <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> diversification away from Russian gas, but diversification of delivery routes away from Ukraine could potentially be achieved within a few years via projects such as the South Stream and Nord Stream pipeline systems.|$|E

The camps I attended were not al-Qaeda. I did not hear about such an organisation until my arrival in Guantanamo Bay.|$|E

He didn't receive a formal {{education}} in his youth and later through years of apprenticeship became self-taught <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> general education and business. Placing great value {{on the merits of}} education he vowed that his sons would not have to endure the same disadvantage.

25|$|Mary Lutyens, a biographer {{and friend}} of Krishnamurti, says {{that there was a}} time when he {{believed}} that he was to become the World Teacher after correct spiritual and secular guidance and education. Another biographer describes the daily program imposed on him by Leadbeater and his associates, which included rigorous exercise and sports, tutoring in a variety of school subjects, Theosophical and religious lessons, yoga and meditation, as well as instruction in proper hygiene and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> British society and culture. At the same time Leadbeater assumed the role of guide in a parallel mystical instruction of Krishnamurti; the existence and progress of this instruction was at the time known only to a select few.|$|E
25|$|Cassiodorus {{was born}} at Scylletium, near Catanzaro in Calabria, Italy. He {{began his career as}} {{councillor}} to his father, the governor of Sicily. While still young, he {{made a name for himself}} as learned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> law. During his working life he worked as quaestor sacri palatii c. 507–511, as a consul in 514, then as magister officiorum under Theoderic, and later under the regency for Theoderic's young successor, Athalaric. Cassiodorus kept copious records and letterbooks concerning public affairs. At the Gothic court his literary skill, which seems mannered and rhetorical to modern readers, was so esteemed that when in Ravenna he was often entrusted with drafting significant public documents. His culminating appointment was as praetorian prefect for Italy, effectively the prime ministership of the Ostrogothic civil government and a high honor to finish any career. Cassiodorus also collaborated with Pope Agapetus I in establishing a library of Greek and Latin texts which were intended to support a Christian school in Rome.|$|E
