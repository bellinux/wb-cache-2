The maximum mean tangential force is detected at the vessel bottom. The mean force value increases somewhat with decreasing impeller off-bottom clearance and is noticeably affected {{by the number of}} <b>impeller</b> <b>blades.</b> Spectral analysis of the experimental data clearly demonstrated the presence of its macro-instability (MI) related low-frequency component embedded in the total force at all values of impeller Reynolds number. The dimensionless frequency of the occurrence of the MI force component is independent of stirring speed, position along the baffle, number of <b>impeller</b> <b>blades</b> and liquid viscosity. Its mean value is about 0. 074. The relative magnitude (Q MI) of the MI-related component of the total force is evaluated by a combination of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and spectral analysis. Relative magnitude Q MI was analysed in dependence on the frequency of the impeller revolution, the axial position of the measuring point in the vessel, the number of <b>impeller</b> <b>blades,</b> the <b>impeller</b> off-bottom clearance, and liquid viscosity. Higher values of Q MI are observed at higher impeller off-bottom clearance height and (generally) Q MI decreases slightly with increasing impeller speed.
