40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest in the effects of traffic on externalities. Research has also shown that in many countries the costs of external effects are even larger than the costs of delay. Therefore {{it can no longer}} suffice to view a transport system as feasible or optimal if only accessibility is considered. Dynamic traffic management (DTM) measures are often used to improve efficiency only, which means that traditionally the optimization of DTM measures considers the single objective of “improving accessibility”. However, these measures are potentially also powerful instruments to reduce emissions of substances related to air quality and climate, <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> and number of accidents. Because there is a proven relation between traffic dynamics and these externalities, DTM measures can be used on a local level, but can also be used on a network level to influence route choice of road users and therefore influencing to what extent certain roads are used. To assess a certain deployment of DTM measures transport models can be used. Because traffic dynamics are important explanatory variables for these externalities and time dependent DTM measures are considered, the usage of a dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) model to assess a certain deployment of DTM measures is recommended. In addition, a DTA model can be used to overcome the widely recognized limitations of static traffic assignment in particular for oversaturated traffic conditions...|$|E

The quantity and quality of the bulk material product can be improved by continuous plant monitoring, the plant stoppage times can be reduced and <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> and dust into the environment can be minimized. Process automation and innovative measuring techniques make a substantial contribution to increasing the availability and reliability of plants. Developments in the consumer market, especially in the gaming console industry, have produced new types of robust sensor technology for registering movements by means of rapidly clocked depth images which, thanks to open programming interfaces, are also rapidly finding their way into the automation technology sector. Technical solutions for logistics and material flow technology are being developed at the Institute for Logistics and Material Flow Technology at Magdeburg University in cooperation with the Fraunhofer Institute for Factory Operation and Automation IFF Magdeburg. These solutions build on the new capability of simple and precise measurement of complex surfaces of bulk materials and plants - 3 D scans of freight pallets, filling level measurements of lorries and railway trucks, 3 D scans of industrial spaces and bulk material analyses when stationary and in motion. The article describes the development of a system concept for monitoring the operating status of belt conveyor systems based on a low cost sensor technology, including the development of corresponding evaluation software for appropriate analysis of the sensor data. Based on the sensor data it is possible to obtain near-real-time information about the volume flow of the bulk material and about the operating status of a belt conveyor system.

This paper shows a proposal how to define the requirements of intelligent transport systems (ITS) for satellite based traffic flow measurement. for defining this requirements four different factors have to be analysed: - possible applications, - mathematical analysis, - applicable regulations and relevant laws, and - important user groups. For analysing the applicable regulations not only national law and orders will be account. It would be a system for cross boarder data collection (a low earth orbit satellite system is global available) and therefore international regulations has to be analysed too. The global availability is one of the major advantages of such a space borne system. Most of the individual parameters are depending on different applications. Therefore it is important to have a close look on these traffic applications. The share of the satellite system for each application has to be analysed. There are already a lot of mathematical analysis's dealing with local and instantaneous traffic flow measurements. The most important will be shown.

40|$|In {{this report}} future annual {{emissions}} amounts of gaseous pollutants, particulate matter (PM 10) and {{noise from the}} non-road mobile machinery sector in Sweden were estimated. The estimates over future emissions amounts were conducted for each year from 2006 to 2020. Special focus has been taken {{to the impact of}} European and national legislations, the age distribution of different types and sizes of machinery and measures to reduce the annual emissions. Besides different measures to reduce emissions, corresponding costs were also estimated. The study comprises fuel consumption and emissions of CO 2, carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), and noise from non-road mobile machinery equipped with diesel engines with a rated engine power of 37 to 560 kW. Non-road mobile machinery for example includes tractors, wheel loaders, excavators, articulate haulers, mobile cranes, combined harvesters, forestry machinery and trucks. The current report was a supplementary study to a report describing a methodology for estimating annual fuel consumption and emissions from the non-road mobile machinery sector in Sweden for year 2006. Inventory data of the year 2006 study was obtained from the Swedish machinery testing institute’s machinery inspection operation, statistics of sale returns from trade organisations and the Swedish motor-vehicle register. The number of machinery and annual fuel consumption and emissions amounts for year 2006 is presented in table S 1. Besides estimates of annual fuel consumption and emissions amounts, <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> was also derived both at a national level and for a specific construction site. For the case study the results showed {{that it was possible to}} reduce the average noise level with more than 3 dB(A) compared with the base scenario just by choosing the machinery fulfilling the strictest noise limits, i. e. Stage II which was mandatory for most machinery from 2006. Other measures simulated included various types of retrofit of noise reduction packages. The specific cost for the different measures to reduce average noise emissions from the specific construction site varied from 4 000 up to more than 500 000 SEK dB- 1. For the estimate of future fuel consumption and emissions amounts various simulations were conducted, each with a different measure for reducing the annual amounts. Five main emission reduction measures or programs were studied: - Scrappage program - Alternative fuel program - Voluntary emission regulation program - Retrofit of aftertreatment program - Noise reduction program The impact on engine exhaust gas emissions and noise of the current European emission and noise regulations, Stage I to IV and Stage I to II for emissions and noise respectively were common for all simulations or programs. Besides the impact of European regulations, annual work was set to a fixed value for each type of machinery and year simulated, thus eliminating any potential changes of the state of the market. The result of the baseline scenario "Business as usual" (BAU), i. e. only taking account to the impact of European regulation, is presented in table S 2 for four different years Both fuel consumption and emissions of CO 2 remains fairly constant as an effect of the assumption that the annual work was set at a fixed value. However, emissions of especially NOx and PM showed a major reduction due to the tighter and tighter regulations. All programs simulated were able to reduce the emissions compared with the BAU scenario with exceptions for emissions of nitrogen oxides, which increased in some of the alternative fuel programs. Both the absolute reduction and cost varied significantly between and within the various programs. Reduction of NOx varied from an accumulated increase in emissions of 25 000 tonne to an accumulated reduction of 22 000 tonne for the studied period from 2006 to 2020. At the same time the accumulated cost for the programs varied from a few hundred million SEK to more than 60 000 million SEK. In table S 3, specific reduction cost for each pollutant in SEK kg- 1 for eight typical emission reduction programs are presented. The results showed that the most economically favourable alternative for reducing emissions from non-road mobile machinery was the voluntary emissions regulation program, i. e. early introduction of machinery fulfilling coming emission limits. Another important result was that the introduction of alternative fuels as a mean of emissions reduction was associated with rather high costs compared to the actual reduction in emissions. For emissions of nitrogen oxides the specific reduction cost varied from almost 100 SEK kg- 1 up to a few hundreds of SEK kg- 1 except for the alternative fuel programs, which resulted in a considerable higher cost...|$|E

Such vibratory motions propagate in the ground-born, generating different dynamic effects on the receptors; these effects can disturb or damage facilities and people.

The aim of this research is to promote a predictive methodology of vibrations induced by metropolitan lines in Naples, due to rail defects; the propagation phenomenon is studied through a "hybrid" model, divided into two sub-models: the former, called "generation model", analyzes the dynamic interaction between the rolling stock and railway equipment; the second, called "propagation model", studies the propagation of vibration waves by means of the finite element method, applying the interaction forces on the superstructure. An adequate data set of experimental vibrations measurements is used to validate the proposed methodology...|$|R
40|$|Current {{literature}} {{concerning the}} perception, annoyance and <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> low-frequency <b>noise</b> from wind turbines are reviewed. Wind turbine noise {{has been shown}} to be annoying to people with annoyance related to noise load. Other factors, such as those related to visual, economic and psychological effects, were also shown to affect a person's annoyance <b>of</b> wind turbine <b>noise.</b> Published infrasound (noise at frequencies less than 20 Hz) measurements show that levels at typical residential set-back distances are too low to be directly audible, but may be perceived via window rattling. On the other hand, low-frequency noise levels, in the frequency range of 20 - 200 Hz may exceed audibility thresholds and it is postulated they may be correlated with annoyance. A review <b>of</b> general low-frequency <b>noise</b> annoyance studies is presented and highlights the similarities of many wind turbine noise complaints with those due to low-frequency noise. The paper concludes with a suggestion to develop a new methodology that can simultaneously acquire annoyance and noise data at the time a person believes they are annoyed by wind turbine noise.

40|$|Together {{with the}} {{atmospheric}} <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> pollutants, <b>noise</b> {{can affect the}} health of the population. In particular, urban traffic is important when considering population health, because of its proximity to the receptors. In comparison with other pollutants, the control <b>of</b> environmental <b>noise</b> has been hampered by insufficient knowledge of its effects on people and of dose-response relationships, as well as by a lack of defined criteria. Due to the high levels <b>of</b> external <b>noise</b> and interior noise, the difficulties are in communication and a series of nonspecific symptoms: irritability, headache, palpitations, sleep disorders, stress. Concerning air pollution, {{the health of the}} population is directly influenced by primary emissions or atmospheric transformation from motor vehicles. Few studies have characterized the spatial correlation between both factors, air pollutants and noise, thus this paper, based on urban noise measurements, presents preliminary data on noise levels in a European capital and a discussion where interactions with air quality are dealt with. Data demonstrates that the urban structure of the analysed city cannot guarantee an adequate protection of the population against <b>noise,</b> because <b>of</b> the interactions between neighbouring areas...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe sound {{pressure}} levels at work places {{are determined by}} the sound <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> the <b>noise</b> relevant facilities like machinery and by the acoustic properties of the room. A strategy has been developed to create virtual models of such sources by single point sources with frequency dependent directivity or by acoustically impervious cuboids covered by grids of point sources. In a pre-process the source distribution is developed from the sound power level and the directivity or by levels at defined positions around the source determined by measurements. This emission is coupled to a hybrid propagation calculation that allows to apply absorptive treatment of surfaces as well as screening objects. Low order reflections are calculated deterministic applying the mirror image method, while higher reflection orders are taken into account by a fast ray tracing calculation. The method is applicable to develop low noise layouts in offices, machine halls or other work places on the basis <b>of</b> standardized <b>emission</b> levels according to the machine directive...|$|R
5000|$|A {{riometer}} (commonly relative ionospheric opacity meter, although originally: Relative Ionospheric Opacity Meter for Extra-Terrestrial <b>Emissions</b> <b>of</b> Radio <b>noise)</b> is {{an instrument}} used {{to quantify the}} amount of electromagnetic-wave ionospheric absorption in the atmosphere. As the name implies, a riometer measures the [...] "opacity" [...] of the ionosphere to radio noise emanating from cosmic origin. In {{the absence of any}} ionospheric absorption, this radio noise, averaged over a sufficiently long period of time, forms a quiet-day curve. Increased ionization in the ionosphere will cause absorption of radio signals (both terrestrial and extraterrestrial), and a departure from the quiet-day curve. The difference between the quiet-day curve and the riometer signal is an indicator of the amount of absorption, and is measured in decibels. Riometers are generally passive radio antenna operating in the VHF radio frequency range (~30-40 MHz). Electromagnetic radiation of that frequency is typically Galactic synchrotron radiation and is absorbed in the Earth's D region of the ionosphere.|$|R

The test section is 75 m long and has the width of one driving lane. The yearly daily traffic is 4000 with 10 % heavy vehicles. The speed limit is 80 km/h and the estimated real speed is somewhat lower. The pavement is optimized for low <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> tyre-road <b>noise</b> by using a high built in air void, small aggregates and elastic material. The pavement has a porous structure and is composed of stone and rubber aggregates with a maximum aggregate size of 5 mm and the binder used is polyurethane. The pavement type has been developed and tested in the laboratory. An intensive monitoring program was started at the Kalvehave test site even before the test section was opened for normal traffic. The monitoring program includes measuring noise, acoustical absorption, elasticity, permeability, friction, rolling resistance and visual inspections. Measurements <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> using the SPB road side and the CPX trailer methods have been repeated continuously over the first 9 months of the lifetime of the PERS pavement...|$|R
