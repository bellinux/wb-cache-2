25|$|For {{the first}} ten years of production, Ensign {{manufactured}} iron parts such as railroad car wheels. The company began building wooden freight cars in the early 1880s, selling {{a large portion of}} its inventory to the Chesapeake and Ohio, Southern Pacific and Central Pacific railroads, all of which were controlled by Huntington. In 1962, the Huntington ACF plant began building a revolutionary new design that quickly became the standard of the rail car industry. The car, known as the CenterFlow covered <b>hopper</b> <b>car,</b> was developed by ACF to transport huge volumes of light-weight, high-bulk commodities, such as plastic pellets. By 1992, ACF had manufactured more than 100,000 hopper cars. The sprawling ACF Industries rail car plant once had many as 1,600 employees with an annual payroll of $30 million. Now, reports indicate only four people work there – and three of them are security guards.|$|E

The unit deviates from standard production by having its maximum speed reduced by software from it is further equipped with snowploughs, air supply to open the <b>hopper</b> <b>car</b> doors, radio remote control and janney couplers. As a back-up, the company will retain the MaK G 1203. The old hooper cars were renovated and put into service, while the track received new concrete ties. The train runs up to 20 trips per day.|$|E

50|$|A rotary car dumper or wagon tippler (UK) is a {{mechanism}} used for unloading certain railroad <b>cars</b> such as <b>hopper</b> <b>cars,</b> gondolas or lorries (tipplers, UK). It holds the rail {{car to a}} section of track and rotates the track and car together to dump out the contents. Used with gondola cars, it is making open <b>hopper</b> <b>cars</b> obsolete. Because <b>hopper</b> <b>cars</b> require sloped chutes in order to direct the contents to the bottom dump doors (hatches) for unloading, gondola cars allow cars to be shorter, thus lowering their center of gravity, while carrying the same gross rail load.|$|R

2500|$|During {{the time}} that Akers was alive, till 1966, money was {{allocated}} to paint and display the engine. In 1969, a group of MSU students formed the Michigan State University Railroad Club as a railfan group. Steve Reeves, a student and part-time employee of the Museum, whose responsibility was to display the engine on football weekends, sent out a notice in the State News that the Railroad Club would be meeting. [...] Those early meetings did not discuss {{the restoration of the}} engine. [...] Instead, they were slide shows of engines various members had seen on trips across the US, most of which were diesels. In 1970, at the suggestion of Randy Paquette, the club investigated the possibility of restoring the locomotive to running condition and started on that goal in 1971, with Baker's permission. Baker later stated that he thought having students be occupied with restoring a locomotive was far more in keeping with his idea of the image the university should be presenting than campus protests. [...] Dr. Breslin, the university vice president, was not so sure. [...] After the club started removing the sheet metal and exposing a rusty boiler, Breslin sent Baker to the engine with two messages. The first was the instruction to paint the engine. (The university needs to look good, even when it is being worked on). The second message was the day the students stop working on the engine is the day the torches come out. [...] The locomotive was safe as long as the students kept working on it. To emphasize, he had the <b>hopper</b> <b>car</b> next to the engine cut up the next week.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the railway}} since the line opening ran Hungarian MÁVAG 51 class steam {{locomotives}} which were replaced in the 1950s by eleven Reşiţa type, 150 horsepower steam locomotives.

In 2001 they've scrapped some of the extra rolling stock, along with the old steam locomotives, <b>hopper</b> <b>cars</b> and passenger cars. Some locomotives and rolling stock were sold to serve on other narrow-gauge lines from Romania or abroad.
