5000|$|Filtered oxygen masks {{have the}} ability to prevent exhaled, {{potentially}} infectious particles from being released into the surrounding environment. These masks are normally of a closed design such that leaks are minimized and breathing of room air is controlled through a series of one-way valves. Filtration of exhaled breaths is accomplished either by placing a filter on the <b>exhalation</b> <b>port,</b> or through an integral filter {{that is part of the}} mask itself. These masks first became popular in the Toronto (Canada) healthcare community during the 2003 SARS Crisis. SARS was identified as being respiratory based and it was determined that conventional oxygen therapy devices were not designed for the containment of exhaled particles. [...] Common practices of having suspected patients wear a surgical mask was confounded by the use of standard oxygen therapy equipment. In 2003, the HiOx80 oxygen mask was released for sale. The HiOx80 mask is a closed design mask that allows a filter to be placed on the <b>exhalation</b> <b>port.</b> Several new designs have emerged in the global healthcare community for the containment and filtration of potentially infectious particles. Other designs include the ISO- oxygen mask, the Flo2Max oxygen mask, and the O-Mask. The use of oxygen masks that are capable of filtering exhaled particles is gradually becoming a recommended practice for pandemic preparation in many jurisdictions.|$|E

30|$|Results Irrespective of the {{nebulizer}} position, Inspi-Neb produced higher inhaled dose than Expi-Neb (position before exhalation port: 75.8  ±  0.9 vs 55.9  ±  0.8  % of nominal dose; position after exhalation port: 34.0  ±  0.4 vs 15.6  ±  0.1  % of {{the nominal}} dose; p <  0.05 for both). At position after <b>exhalation</b> <b>port,</b> adding 289 -mL corrugated piece of tubing between <b>exhalation</b> <b>port</b> and nebulizer {{was associated with}} an increase in aerosol delivery of Expi-Neb (+ 5.7  ±  0.2  % of the nominal dose; p <  0.05).|$|E

40|$|Background: Few {{studies on}} {{performance}} comparison of nebulizer systems {{coupled with a}} single-limb circuit bilevel ventilator are available. Most of these data compared the aerosol drug delivery for only two different systems. Using an adult lung bench model of noninvasive ventilation, we compared inhaled and lost doses of three nebulizer systems coupled with a single-limb circuit bilevel ventilator, {{as well as the}} influence of the nebulizer position. Method: Three vibrating mesh nebulizers (Aeroneb® Pro, Aeroneb® Solo, and NIVO®), one jet nebulizer (Sidestream®), and one ultrasonic nebulizer (Servo Ultra Nebulizer 145 ®) coupled with a bilevel ventilator were tested. They were charged with amikacin solution (500 mg/ 4 mL) and operated at two different positions: before and after the <b>exhalation</b> <b>port</b> (starting from the lung). The inhaled dose, the expiratory wasted dose, and the estimated lost dose were assessed by the residual gravimetric method. Results: The doses varied widely among the nebulizer types and position. When the nebulizer was positioned before the <b>exhalation</b> <b>port,</b> the vibrating mesh nebulizer delivered the highest inhaled dose (p< 0. 001), the jet nebulizer the highest expiratory wasted dose (p< 0. 001), and the ultrasonic device the highest total lost dose (p< 0. 001). When the nebulizer was positioned after the <b>exhalation</b> <b>port,</b> the vibrating mesh nebulizers delivered the highest inhaled (p< 0. 001) and expiratory wasted doses (p< 0. 001), and the ultrasonic device the highest total lost dose (p< 0. 001). The most efficient nebulizers were NIVO and Aeroneb Solo when placed before the <b>exhalation</b> <b>port.</b> Conclusions: In a single-limb circuit bilevel ventilator, vibrating mesh nebulizers positioned between the <b>exhalation</b> <b>port</b> and lung model are more efficient for drug delivery compared with jet or ultrasonic nebulizers. In this position, the improved efficiency of vibrating mesh nebulizers was due to an increase in the inhaled dose and a reduction in the exhaled wasted dose compared with placement between the ventilator and the expiratory port. Because of the high total lost dose, the ultrasonic device should not be recommended. Nebulizer placement before the <b>exhalation</b> <b>port</b> increased the inhaled dose and decreased the expiratory wasted dose, except for the jet nebulizer...|$|E

40|$|International audienceMost pressure-support devices use {{a single}} circuit with an <b>exhalation</b> <b>port</b> {{integrated}} in the mask. The {{aim of the}} current study was to compare the effects of masks having different manufacturer-inserted leaks on ventilator performance. We simulated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and restrictive disease. Four ventilators (VENTImotion (Weinmann, Hamburg, Germany), VPAP III STA (ResMed, Saint Priest, France), Synchrony 2 (Respironics, Nantes, France) and Vivo 40 (Breas, Saint Priest)) were tested with the recommended masks and with the masks having the largest and smallest leaks. Tests were performed with pressure support levels of 10, 15 and 20 cmH(2) O. The in vivo evaluation compared two ventilators using recommended masks opposed in terms of exhaled port resistance. The ventilators were tested with their recommended mask, and after mask exchange. The mask with the largest leak induced auto-triggering and/or increased inspiratory-trigger sensitivity was the VENTImotion under both simulated conditions and VPAP III STA under the simulated obstructive-disease condition. The mask with the smallest leak-increased inspiratory-trigger delay was Synchrony 2 in the simulated obstructive-disease condition and increased rebreathing. The in vivo study confirmed the bench results. When switching to a mask that has a different leak, evaluation is needed to adjust trigger sensitivity and pressurisation level and to check the absence of rebreathing...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUNDNoninvasive {{ventilation}} (NIV) via helmet or total facemask is {{an option}} for managing patients with respiratory infections in respiratory failure. However, the risk of nosocomial infection is unknown. METHODSWe examined exhaled air dispersion during NIV using a human patient simulator reclined at 45 ° in a negative pressure room with 12 air changes/h by two different helmets via a ventilator and a total facemask via a bilevel positive airway pressure device. Exhaled air was marked by intrapulmonary smoke particles, illuminated by laser light sheet, and captured by a video camera for data analysis. Significant exposure was defined as where there was ≥ 20 % of normalized smoke concentration. RESULTSDuring NIV via a helmet with the simulator programmed in mild lung injury, exhaled air leaked through the neck-helmet interface with a radial distance of 150 to 230 mm when inspiratory positive airway pressure was increased from 12 to 20 cm H 2 O, respectively, while keeping the expiratory pressure at 10 cm H 2 O. During NIV via a helmet with air cushion around the neck, there was negligible air leakage. During NIV via a total facemask for mild lung injury, air leaked through the <b>exhalation</b> <b>port</b> to 618 and 812 mm when inspiratory pressure was increased from 10 to 18 cm H 2 O, respectively, with the expiratory pressure at 5 cm H 2 O.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Failure of noninvasive {{ventilation}} (NIV) {{has been}} associated with short-term adverse effects related to the use of masks. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the incidence, type and intensity of adverse effects, as well as the comfort, of total face masks (TFMs), facial masks (FMs) and nasal masks (NMs) during NIV. METHODS: This was a randomized crossover trial involving 24 healthy volunteers submitted to six sessions of NIV in bilevel positive airway pressure mode using the TFM, FM and NM masks at low and moderate-to-high pressure levels. A written questionnaire was applied in order to evaluate eleven specific adverse effects related to the use of the masks. Comfort was assessed using a visual analog scale. The CO 2 exhaled into the ventilator circuit was measured between the mask and the <b>exhalation</b> <b>port.</b> RESULTS: The performance of the TFM was similar to that of the NM and FM in terms of comfort scores. Higher pressure levels reduced comfort and increased adverse effects, regardless of the mask type. When the TFM was used, there were fewer air leaks and less pain at the nose bridge, although there was greater oronasal dryness and claustrophobia. Air leaks were most pronounced when the FM was used. The partial pressure of exhaled CO 2 entering the ventilator circuit was zero for the TFM. CONCLUSIONS: The short-term adverse effects caused by NIV interfaces are related to mask type and pressure settings. The TFM is a reliable alternative to the NM and FM. Rebreathing of CO 2 from the circuit is less likely to occur when a TFM is used...|$|E

O objetivo deste estudo foi comparar a incidência, tipo e intensidade de eventos adversos e conforto das máscaras facial total (MFT), facial (MF) e nasal (MN). MÉTODOS: Estudo randomizado, tipo cruzado, em 24 voluntários sadios submetidos a seis períodos de VNI, modo bilevel positive airway pressure em ajustes de baixa e moderada a alta pressão. Foi aplicado um questionário de avaliação de onze eventos adversos especificamente relacionados ao uso das máscaras. O conforto foi avaliado por escala visual analógica. O CO 2 exalado no circuito foi medido entre a conexão da máscara e o orifício de exalação. RESULTADOS: A MFT teve desempenho similar a MF e MN quanto a escores de conforto. A aplicação de pressões mais altas reduziu o conforto e aumentou a incidência e a intensidade dos eventos adversos, independentemente do tipo de máscara. A MFT teve melhor desempenho quanto a vazamentos e dor no nariz e pior resultado quanto ao ressecamento oronasal e claustrofobia. A MF teve o pior resultado quanto a vazamentos. A pressão parcial do CO 2 exalado no circuito permaneceu em zero com a MFT. CONCLUSÕES: Os eventos adversos agudos causados pelas interfaces de VNI são relacionados ao tipo de máscara e aos parâmetros de pressão. A MFT é uma alternativa confiável às MF e MN. A reinalação de CO 2 a partir do circuito é menos provável de ocorrer com a MFT...|$|E
