50|$|Around 1880, photographers {{realized}} that aperture size affected depth of field. Aperture control gained more significance, and adjustable stops became a standard lens feature. The <b>iris</b> <b>diaphragm</b> made its appearance as an adjustable lens {{stop in the}} 1880s, andi t became the standard adjustable stop about 1900. The <b>iris</b> <b>diaphragm</b> had been common in early nineteenth century cameras obscura, and Niépce used one {{in at least one}} of his experimental cameras. However, the specific type of iris used in modern lenses was invented in 1858 by Charles Harrison and Joseph Schnitzer. Harrison and Schnitzer's <b>iris</b> <b>diaphragm</b> was capable of rapid open and close cycles, an absolute necessity for lenses with camera auto-aperture control.|$|E
50|$|Lenses with 11, 12, or 15 blade <b>iris</b> <b>diaphragms</b> {{are often}} claimed {{to excel in}} bokeh quality. Because of this, the lenses don't need to reach wide {{apertures}} to get better circles (instead of polygons). In the past, wide aperture lenses (f/2, f/2.8) were very expensive, due to the complex mathematical design and manufacturing know-how required, {{at a time when}} all computations and glass making were done by hand. Leica could reach a good bokeh at f/4.5. Today {{it is much easier to}} make an f/1.8 lens, and a 9-bladed lens at f/1.8 is enough for an 85mm lens to achieve great bokeh.|$|R
50|$|<b>Iris</b> <b>diaphragms</b> with moving blades {{are used}} in most modern camera lenses to {{restrict}} the light received by the film or sensor. While manufacturers attempt to make the aperture circular for a pleasing bokeh, its shape tends towards a polygon with {{the same number of}} sides as blades when stopped down to high f-numbers (small apertures). Diffraction spreads out light waves passing through the aperture perpendicular to the roughly-straight edge, each edge yielding two spikes 180° apart. As the blades are uniformly distributed around the circle, on a diaphragm with an even number of blades, the diffraction spikes from blades on opposite sides overlap. Consequently, a diaphragm with n&thinsp; blades yields n&thinsp; spikes if n&thinsp; is even, and 2n&thinsp; spikes if n&thinsp; is odd.|$|R
40|$|DE 2611011 C UPAB: 19930901 An optical {{coupling}} device is {{for use in}} communications equipment, in optical repeaters. For coupling in one direction an arrangement of monomode fibres and gradient fibres is used, with {{one end of the}} monomode fibre abutting one end of the gradient fibres. The fibres are so adjusted that the core of the monomode fibre meets a point on the core of the gradient fibre at which the refractive index of the core of each fibre is the same. The fibres are fixed in this relative position, in which the losses are a min. for the direction of transmission, but very great for transmission in the reverse direction. To suppress mantle waves, <b>iris</b> <b>diaphragms</b> may be fitted to one or both ends of the fibres...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{presented}} Z-suture is a simple, {{rapid and}} safe knotless technique that facilitates transscleral suture fixation of various intraocular implants in the ciliary sulcus like sutured intraocular lenses, artificial iris prostheses, and <b>iris</b> <b>diaphragms.</b> As the knotless approach reliably avoids suture erosion, external fixation {{can be performed}} without any protecting scleral flaps or lamellar grooves. The needle is simply passed through the sulcus, and the emerging polypropylene suture is secured in the sclera using a zigzag shaped intrascleral suture (Z-suture). Each pass starts directly adjacent to the exiting site. Five passes are sufficient to reliably fix the suture resisting even maximum tractive forces. Once this procedure is done, the suture can be cut without any knot. By avoiding suture knots, and hence the necessity for intrascleral flaps, this knotless approach may help to reduce suture-related complications such as scleral atrophy, suture erosion and infections...|$|R
50|$|The iris (plural: irides or irises) is a thin, {{circular}} {{structure in}} the eye, responsible for controlling the diameter {{and size of the}} pupil and thus the amount of light reaching the retina. Eye color is defined by that of the iris. In optical terms, the pupil is the eye's aperture, while the <b>iris</b> is the <b>diaphragm.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{biological}} pupil {{of the eye}} is its aperture in optics nomenclature; the <b>iris</b> is the <b>diaphragm</b> {{that serves}} as the aperture stop. Refraction in the cornea causes the effective aperture (the entrance pupil in optics parlance) to differ slightly from the physical pupil diameter. The entrance pupil is typically about 4mm in diameter, although it can range from 2mm (...) in a brightly lit place to 8mm (...) in the dark.|$|R
50|$|Iris folding is a paper craft {{technique}} that involves folding strips of colored paper {{in such a}} way to form a design. The center of the design forms an iris — a shape reminiscent of the <b>iris</b> <b>diaphragm</b> of a camera lens.|$|E
50|$|A natural {{optical system}} that has a {{diaphragm}} and an aperture is the human eye. The iris is the diaphragm, and the opening in the iris of the eye (the pupil) is the aperture. An analogous dev in a photographic lens is called an <b>iris</b> <b>diaphragm.</b>|$|E
50|$|Today, Waterhouse stops {{are largely}} obsolete; most modern {{photographic}} lenses {{are made with}} an <b>iris</b> <b>diaphragm.</b> Some compact digital cameras use 2-hole diaphragms for limited aperture control. One modern device that still uses interchangeable stops is the Lensbaby. Another is a new Petzval lens being crowdfunded by Lomography.|$|E
5000|$|The eye {{includes}} a lens similar to lenses found in optical instruments such as cameras {{and the same}} physics principles can be applied. The pupil of the human eye is its aperture; the <b>iris</b> is the <b>diaphragm</b> {{that serves as the}} aperture stop. Refraction in the cornea causes the effective aperture (the entrance pupil) to differ slightly from the physical pupil diameter. The entrance pupil is typically about 4 mm in diameter, although it can range from 2 mm (...) in a brightly lit place to 8 mm (...) in the dark. The latter value decreases slowly with age; older people's eyes sometimes dilate to not more than 5-6mm in the dark, and may be as small as 1mm in the light.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} years of photography, a lens could be fitted with one of a set of {{interchangeable}} diaphragms https://books.google.com/books?vid=0OrF3Gg18eOZGCnsbWwn&id=AN6d4zTjquwC&pg=PA83, often as brass strips known as Waterhouse stops or Waterhouse diaphragms. The <b>iris</b> <b>diaphragm</b> in most modern still and video cameras is adjusted by movable blades, simulating the iris of the eye.|$|E
50|$|The Arlow-Abbe {{condenser}} is {{a modified}} Abbe condenser that replaces the <b>iris</b> <b>diaphragm,</b> filter holder, lamp and lamp optics {{with a small}} OLED or LCD digital display unit. The display unit allows for digitally synthesised filters for dark-field, Rheinberg, oblique and dynamic (constantly changing) illumination under direct computer control. The device was first described by Dr. Jim Arlow in Microbe Hunter magazine, issue 38.|$|E
50|$|A lens {{will most}} often have an {{aperture}} adjustment mechanism, usually an <b>iris</b> <b>diaphragm,</b> {{to regulate the}} amount of light that passes. In early camera models a rotating plate or slider with different sized holes was used. These Waterhouse stops may still be found on modern, specialized lenses. A shutter, to regulate the time during which light may pass, may be incorporated within the lens assembly (for better quality imagery), within the camera, or even, rarely, {{in front of the}} lens. Some cameras with leaf shutters in the lens omit the aperture, and the shutter does double duty.|$|E
5000|$|The {{diaphragm}} has two {{to twenty}} blades (with most lenses today featuring {{between five and}} ten blades), depending on price {{and quality of the}} device in which it is used. Straight blades result in polygon shape of the diaphragm opening, while curved blades improve the roundness of the iris opening. In a photograph, the number of blades that the <b>iris</b> <b>diaphragm</b> has can be guessed by counting the number of diffraction spikes converging from a light source or bright reflection. For an odd number of blades, there are twice as many spikes as there are blades.|$|E
50|$|The Abbe {{condenser}} {{is named}} for its inventor Ernst Abbe, who developed it in 1870. The Abbe condenser, which was originally designed for Zeiss, is mounted below {{the stage of the}} microscope. The condenser concentrates and controls the light that passes through the specimen prior to entering the objective. It has two controls, one which moves the Abbe condenser closer to or further from the stage, and another, the <b>iris</b> <b>diaphragm,</b> which controls the diameter of the beam of light. The controls can be used to optimize brightness, evenness of illumination, and contrast. Abbe condensers are difficult to use for magnifications of above 400X, as the aplanatic cone is only representative of an NA 0.6.|$|E
5000|$|The {{nodal points}} are widely {{misunderstood}} in photography, {{where it is}} commonly asserted that the light rays [...] "intersect" [...] at [...] "the nodal point", that the <b>iris</b> <b>diaphragm</b> of the lens is located there, {{and that this is}} the correct pivot point for panoramic photography, so as to avoid parallax error. These claims generally arise from confusion about the optics of camera lenses, as well as confusion between the nodal points and the other cardinal points of the system. (A better choice of the point about which to pivot a camera for panoramic photography can be shown to be the centre of the systems entrance pupil. [...] On the other hand, swing-lens cameras with fixed film position rotate the lens about the rear nodal point to stabilize the image on the film.) ...|$|E
50|$|CPEs are {{important}} aspects of a viral infection in diagnostics. Many CPEs {{can be seen in}} unfixed, unstained cells under the low power of an optical microscope, with the condenser down and the <b>iris</b> <b>diaphragm</b> partly closed. However, with some CPEs, namely inclusion bodies, the cells must be fixed and stained then viewed under light microscopy. Some viruses’ CPEs are characteristic and therefore can be an important tool for virologists in diagnosing an infected animal or human. The rate of CPE appearance is also an important characteristic that virologists may use to identify virus type. If CPE appears after 4 to 5 days in vitro at low multiplicity of infection, then the virus is considered slow. If the CPE appears after 1 to 2 days in vitro at low multiplicity of infection, then the virus is thought to be rapid. Inoculations always occur at low multiplicity of infection because at high multiplicity of infection, all CPEs occur rapidly.|$|E
50|$|In the mid-1980s, William Bradshaw Amos and John Graham White {{and colleagues}} {{working at the}} Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge built the first {{confocal}} beam scanning microscope. The stage with the sample was not moving, instead the illumination spot was, allowing faster image acquisition: four images per second with 512 lines each. Hugely magnified intermediate images, due to a 1-2 meter long beam path, allowed {{the use of a}} conventional <b>iris</b> <b>diaphragm</b> as a ‘pinhole’, with diameters ~ 1 mm. First micrographs were taken with long-term exposure on film before a digital camera was added. A further improvement allowed zooming into the preparation for the first time. Zeiss, Leitz and Cambridge Instruments had no interest in a commercial production. The Medical Research Council (MRC) finally sponsored development of a prototype. The design was acquired by Bio-Rad, amended with computer control and commercialized as ‘MRC 500’. The successor MRC 600 was later the basis {{for the development of the}} first two-photon-fluorescent microscope developed 1990 at Cornell University.|$|E
50|$|In an {{eye with}} total loss of bag {{where there is}} no capsular bag remnant, glued IOL {{scaffold}} is used. In this first a glued IOL is done behind the cataract pieces. The glued IOL then works as a scaffold and the cataract pieces are removed with the phaco handpiece using ultrasound. Here two partial thickness scleral flaps measuring 2.5 to 2.5 mm are made 180 degrees diagonally apart. Infusion is placed by anterior chamber maintainer and sclerotomies are made below the flaps with 20 gauge needle. The desired IOL is injected below the remaining lens particles in the eye and the remaining lens are positioned on the artificial lens or IOL(Fig 2). The haptics of the IOL are brought out under the flaps as in the glued IOL method and tucked into the scleral tunnel made with 26 gauge needle at the entry site. The phacoemulsification procedure is then continued on the IOL and the anterior chamber is formed {{by the end of the}} procedure. Scleral flaps and conjunctiva are then closed with fibrin glue.In IOL scaffold the IOL is placed above the <b>iris</b> (<b>diaphragm</b> of the eye) or above some remnant of the capsule whereas in glued IOL scaffold as there is not enough iris or capsule support a glued IOL is done which then acts as a scaffold.|$|E
5000|$|Making {{altitude}} (elevation) {{measurements of}} the Sun being simple and direct, requiring the user to aligning {{the image of the}} Sun through the front pinhole (aperture), centered onto the rear back plate which operates more like a mask and not a viewing pass hole for sighting the Sun with the naked eye. Much {{in the same manner as}} performing eyepiece projection with a telescope, one fashioned with a front and rear aperture (font lens and rear eyepiece) along with a projection screen behind the eyepiece, or more rudimentary, the projecting of the Sun’s image upon a small screen plate such as that done with a mariner’s back staff. The rear, or second aperture (pass hole) having the function of working as a blacken attenuator so that any reflecting, annulus shaped sunlight off the metal aperture is not too bright, the Sun’s image (light) passing through the second hole and similar in task though void of a fixed image plane, to that of an <b>iris</b> (<b>diaphragm)</b> in a camera lens to reduce the light intensity. For relative to human physiology, focusing on a bright spot of light such as a pin point image of the Sun for any extended period or repetitively over a short duration of time adversely effects momentarily, a person’s visual acuity, thus making it more challenging to focus one’s eyes to read the angular scale. It being typical to orientate the instrument such that the operator faces looking slightly down upon the scale, the Sun at the users left, with right hand placed in such a way that the rays of sunlight pass through the two, perforated sighting plates, forming a bright illuminated spot on the observer’s finger (see photo), the finger functioning as a projection screen. At the moment an optical alignment with the Sun is established, the angular value of the device is read by the operator at the point where the graduated scale is bisected by the hanging plumb line.|$|E
40|$|In the aphakic eye, with intact <b>iris</b> <b>diaphragm,</b> {{silicone}} oil has frequently caused a pupillary block. In this situation aqueous humour accumulates behind the iris and forces {{silicone oil}} through the pupil into the anterior chamber. An iridectomy at the 6 o'clock position can effectively prevent this pupillary block. The iridectomy allows free passage of aqueous to the anterior chamber which remains free of silicone oil. No permanent contact with silicone {{oil and the}} cornea is established, and development of keratopathy is prevented. The effect of this iridectomy in 62 eyes with intact <b>iris</b> <b>diaphragm</b> in patients in Rotterdam (35 cases) and Nagoya (27 cases) is demonstrated.
