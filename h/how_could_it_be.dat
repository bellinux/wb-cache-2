25|$|This {{argument}} has been formulated by Paul Churchland, among others. The point is that, in instances {{of some sort}} of brain damage (e.g. caused by automobile accidents, drug abuse, pathological diseases, etc.), it is always the case that the mental substance and/or properties of the person are significantly changed or compromised. If the mind were a completely separate substance from the brain, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> possible that every single time the brain is injured, the mind is also injured? Indeed, it is very frequently the case that one can even predict and explain the kind of mental or psychological deterioration or change that human beings will undergo when specific parts of their brains are damaged. So the question for the dualist to try to confront is how can all of this be explained if the mind is a separate and immaterial substance from, or if its properties are ontologically independent of, the brain.|$|E

According to him, {{the experience was}} like an old scary movie, with [...] "the obligatory castle high on the craggy cliff with the wolves howling in the woods. Sure enough, the vampire was {{up there in the}} castle. To most of the players it seemed like a straight forward task: find the vampire and kill him." [...] One player discovered Strahd's backstory and was so affected by it that {{when it came time to}} kill the vampire at the end of {{the adventure}}, despite having a sword capable of dispatching Strahd, he refused, and his companions were forced to complete the task. Afterwards, Hickman asked him why. [...] "He deserved to die better than that," [...] his friend said, to which Hickman replied [...] "Yes [...] But that is how it is with people who fall from greatness. He chose his end when he first chose to kill his brother. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> any different?" ...|$|E
