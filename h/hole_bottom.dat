40|$|Abstract: During coalbed methane underbalanced {{drilling}} process, {{because of}} coal’s low mechanical strength, the coal seam {{can not support}} overburden pressure, {{which is likely to}} lead to sloughing and collapsing in coal seams; besides, as coal seams in China have low pressure and low permeability, they are prone to be contaminated. as a result, it is easy to occur various complicate situations in downhole if the <b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> pressure exceeds the designed safety range, which threatens life and property. In the light of the coalbed methane cavity aerated underbalanced drilling, this paper puts forward a <b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> pressure safety monitoring technology for monitoring in the coalbed methane cavity aerated underbalanced drilling, designs and develops assorted <b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> pressure safety monitoring system that can monitor and analyze <b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> pressure during the drilling process timely, ensures safe construction of coalbed methane underbalanced drilling, and keeps <b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> pressure steady in real time during the coalbed methane underbalanced drilling.

During this time, helium with an isotopic composition (3 He/ 4 He) of 3.4  Ra would alter to 3.3 – 2.8  Ra.

30|$|Let a DS be {{lowering}} {{in a plane}} circular bore hole. Then, it slides along the bore <b>hole</b> <b>bottom</b> line and its axis line is a circle of a radius ρ + a, where ρ is the radius of the bore hole axis T and a is the system clearance. In sliding, the DS is subjected to action of gravity (f gr), contact (f cont), and friction (f fr) forces. In consequence of these forces, the DS can be compressed in some segments of its length where it can begin to buckle without losing its contact with the well wall. It is necessary to predict the critical states of the DS and to construct the modes of its stability loss.|$|E

One of these was the Broadlands district, where a resistivity survey had located a sizeable area of subsurface water. The first hole, east of the Waikato River (Fig. 2), was drilled in late 1965, but although the temperature at <b>hole</b> <b>bottom</b> is 278 degrees, rock permeability is low and the bore is a poor steam producer. However, further drillholes (Br 2, 3 and 4) in the Ohaki area tapped good supplies of high temperature water and prompted a fullscale scientific and exploratory drilling programme.

40|$|Carbon Fiber-Reinforced by Plastic (CFRP) is now {{commonly}} used in the aircraft industry. The main challenge is to manufacture this difficult-to-cut work material, considering its quality criteria and economical aspects.
