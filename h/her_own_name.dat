5|$|As Anderson {{remained}} {{throughout her}} life evasive {{about the details}} of her life as a commercial writer, it is not known when she began writing commercially under pseudonyms, what those pseudonyms were, or, indeed, how much she wrote. She revealed only that she began writing for magazines and newspapers out of commercial necessity, and rarely under <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>name.</b> Although she achieved success later in this field, she sometimes stated that, as her writing improved, her pieces were more frequently turned down for publication. In her thirties, she began to write for commercial radio. Beginning with half-hour slots, Anderson gradually became interested in the technique of crafting radio plays, and began submitting some of her better work to the ABC under <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>name.</b> She later ascribed her fondness for writing the expansive dialogue in her novels to her early experience writing radio plays.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} Harris {{claimed to have}} been the first woman science-fiction writer in the United States. While this can be debated (since Gertrude Barrows Bennett, writing under the {{pseudonym}} Francis Stevens, published science fiction stories as early as 1917), Harris is recognized as the first woman to publish stories in science fiction magazines under <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>name.</b>|$|E
5|$|Under Canadian law, miners {{first had}} to get a license, either when they arrived at Dawson or en route from Victoria in Canada. They could then {{prospect}} for gold and, when they had found a suitable location, lay claim to mining rights over it. To stake a claim, a prospector would drive stakes into the ground a measured distance apart and then return to Dawson to register the claim for $15 ($410). This normally had to be done within three days, and by 1897 only one claim per person at a time was allowed in a district, although married couples could exploit a loophole that allowed the wife to register a claim in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>name,</b> doubling their amount of land.|$|E

5|$|Although Sir Flinders {{himself did}} not join the {{expedition}} in 1929, he sent Olga {{with a group of}} other archaeologists to Qau, where they spent two months recording the reliefs from the tombs of the ancient rulers. She and a few colleagues, including Gerald Lankester Harding, then joined the season's primary expedition, which was being led by James Leslie Starkey at the Tell Far'a tomb group in Palestine. During the time she would not only supervise the work of a team, but also ran an evening clinic for the Arab workers and families, as well as other local people. In all, she would help up to forty people per day with minor injuries or upset stomachs. Sir Flinders joined the group in 1930 and after reviewing Olga's work, allowed her to publish it under <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>name.</b> In 1931, during the Petrie expedition to Tell el-'Ajjul, Olga discovered a Hyksos tomb which included a horse burial.|$|E
5|$|Stevens parted {{ways with}} the NWP in 1947 and turned instead to {{activity}} in the Lucy Stone League, a women’s rights organization based on Lucy Stone's retention of her maiden name after marriage. After World War II ended, the organization was revived in 1950 because the rights women had seen surge during the war were reverting to their pre-war state. Stevens {{was one of the}} reorganizers along with Freda Kirchwey, Frances Perkins and others. Stevens had long been a proponent of a woman retaining <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>name</b> and did not take her husband's name in either of her marriages. She had remarried to Jonathan Mitchell on August 31, 1935 in Portland, Maine. Mitchell was a reporter for The New Republic during the Roosevelt years and later for the National Review, and was an anti-communist. He took part in the McCarthy hearings and Stevens, after her marriage to him, moved politically to the right, from her previously socialist leanings.|$|E

Several men wrote of their affection for her, including Rufus Wilmot Griswold, to whom Osgood dedicated a book of poetry. She also wrote a Valentine poem that mingled <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>name</b> with Griswold's. The competition between Griswold and Poe for Osgood may have led to their infamous rivalry, best exemplified in Griswold's character assassination of Poe after Poe's death.|$|E

25|$|For practicality, {{usually only}} the last surname (excluding prepositions) is used in formal {{greetings}} or in scientific papers indexing. But, in a list of people, the first given name, not the surname, is used for alphabetical sorting. A married woman may add her partner's last surname(s) {{to the end of}} <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>name,</b> but this is not mandatory and increasingly less common. The same may happen with men, though this is extremely rare.|$|E
25|$|While {{small-scale}} boarding {{houses were}} the norm, the times were favorable {{for a more}} ambitious approach. In 1830, Margaret Cook completed the process of purchasing the Ximenez House from its heirs. Cook had relocated to St. Augustine from Charleston with her second husband Samuel in 1821. A widow again by 1830, she had the freedom not routinely granted to married women of her day to transact business in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>name.</b> She secured these rights through legal documents signed by her husband before his death.|$|E
25|$|The area {{now known}} as Jefferson County was first settled in 1836, and became Jefferson County in 1839, with the new {{community}} of Fairfield as the county seat. The name was suggested by Nancy Bonnifield, one of the settlers, because it aptly described the fair fields of the area. But also author Susan Welty suggests it was a play of words on <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>name</b> (bonny field). By 1840, Fairfield had a population of 110 and grew to 650 in 1847. The city {{was the site of}} the first and second Iowa State Fairs.|$|E

25|$|The historians Tacitus and Cassius Dio depict an overweening, even domineering dowager, {{ready to}} {{interfere}} in Tiberius’ decisions, the most notable instances being the case of Urgulania (grandmother of Claudius's first wife Plautia Urgulanilla), a woman who correctly assumed that her friendship with the empress placed her above the law, and Munatia Plancina, suspected of murdering Germanicus and saved at Livia's entreaty. (Plancina committed suicide in AD 33 after being accused again of murder after Livia's death). A notice from AD 22 records that Julia Augusta (Livia) dedicated a statue to Augustus {{in the center of}} Rome, placing <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>name</b> even before that of Tiberius.|$|E
25|$|In 1880 Gina Krog {{travelled}} to Great Britain, {{where she}} stayed a {{while at the}} Bedford College, and made contacts with the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies {{and the leader of}} the organization Millicent Garrett Fawcett. Back in Norway she started writing newspaper articles, first under pseudonyms, and later under <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>name.</b> She belonged to the radical feminists, demanding full equal political rights between women and men, contrasting the more moderate feminists who focused on the improvement of women's financial conditions. She proclaimed the women's right to vote on equal conditions as men, without compromise. This point of view came to be a disputed issue within the feminist movement of the time.|$|E

Judith married Thomas Quiney, who was a vintner and tavern owner from a good family, in February 1616 when she was 31 and he was 27. Shakespeare may later have disapproved of this choice when {{it was discovered that}} Quiney had made another girl pregnant; also, Quiney had failed to obtain a special wedding licence needed during Lent, leading to Judith and Thomas being excommunicated on 12 March. Soon afterwards, on 25 March 1616, Shakespeare modified his will for Judith to inherit £300 in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>name,</b> leaving Quiney out of the will and giving most of his property to Susanna and her husband.|$|E

25|$|In 1950, Barbara Ward married Australian Commander Robert Jackson, an {{administrator}} for the United Nations. Their son Robert was born in 1956, {{the same year that}} his father was knighted. Ward continued to use <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>name</b> professionally and was not widely known as Lady Jackson. Over the next few years they lived in West Africa and made various visits to India, and these experiences helped form Ward's views on the need for Western nations to contribute to the economic development of poorer countries. For the next two decades both husband and wife travelled a great deal, and eventually their marriage suffered from this. A legal separation was arranged in the early 1970s though Ward, as a Catholic, did not want divorce. In 1976 when she was given a life peerage she used her estranged husband's surname for her title as Baroness Jackson of Lodsworth.|$|E
25|$|Fawcett {{was also}} an author. She usually wrote under <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>name</b> as Millicent Garrett Fawcett; however, as a public figure she was Mrs. Henry Fawcett. Fawcett had three books, a co-authored book with her husband Henry Fawcett, and many articles, {{some of which were}} {{published}} retrospectively. Fawcett's textbook, Political Economy for Beginners, went to ten editions, sparked two novels and was reproduced in many languages. One of Fawcett's first articles on women's education was published in Macmillan's Magazine in 1875. In 1875, Fawcett's interest in women's education lead her {{to become one of the}} founders of the Newnham College for Women, located in Cambridge. Fawcett served on the college council, she was also supported a controversial bid for all women to receive Cambridge degrees. Millicent was also a speaker and lecturer at girls' schools and women's colleges, and also spoke in adult education centres. In 1899, for her services in education, the University of St. Andrews awarded her an honorary LLD.|$|E
