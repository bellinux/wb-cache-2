500|$|Davis {{was happy}} to have an episode of his own, but was puzzled {{at some of the}} contradictions in the script, such as having him assassinate John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., but being {{concerned}} with something as minor as keeping the Buffalo Bills from winning the Super Bowl. Chris Carter said [...] "I had to speak with Bill several times; I spent hours with him on the telephone talking about the character, because the actor felt that the episode really made the character something that it wasn't. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> to him, as I think Jim and Glen were trying to express, that even if your mission in life is a destroyer, that you still have some hope {{in the back of your}} mind that you can be a creator— and that this all of a sudden, this vanity, is his vanity. And we see that so clearly here and it makes him sort of a silly person".|$|E
2500|$|Off-screen, actress Lucy Speed {{had decided}} to leave the serial after playing Natalie for a year, as she was {{reportedly}} “freaked out” by the media attention she was receiving from being in such a high-profile show. In an interview with the ‘’Walford Gazette’’, Speed commented: “I was very frightened by it quite frankly and certainly unprepared for it. I didn't like at all the attention that came with being on such a high-profile show. It simply wasn't what I signed up for in the first place-all that craziness. I was naive, I admit. Of course it does come with the job of being on the show and {{you have to learn to}} deal with it and cope with it. The advantages always outweigh the drawbacks, anyway, but it didn't seem like that to me at the time. I was very young and extremely shy, so it all became a huge difficulty for me…But I also have to make it clear that from the beginning when I joined, I always intended to stay in it for just a year anyway. I honoured my initial one-year contract and then moved on…they did express their interest in signing me for another year, but I politely but firmly declined. They were a bit shocked. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> in the best way I could my reasons for leaving at the end of my contract and they ultimately understood, and so I left on good terms with them…I had some growing up to do and instinctively knew that growing up more or less in front of the British public for one year was enough!” ...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} the sequel of “Quantificatori generalizzati e logica del primo ordine - I”. In that paper I argued {{that from the}} point of view of Generalized Quantifier theory one can single out some classes of quantifiers that cannot be {{identified}} by first order logic. The discovery of these classes is important because it allows <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> some regularities observed in natural language: in some contexts, only the quantifiers of one of these classes may appear. In this paper I examine existential and partitive contexts in particular. Existential contexts are those in which a NP follows the expression “there is/are [...] . ”. I show that only one of the three types of quantifiers singled out in the first part of this work is allowed in these contexts, while the other two are not. <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> why this happens on the basis of the characterization of those classes I gave in the first paper. Partitive contexts are those of the type “NP 1 of NP 2 ”. Only the NPs determined by one of identified classes of quantifiers are allowed in NP 2 position.
