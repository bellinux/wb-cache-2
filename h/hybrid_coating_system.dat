For this intent, functionally graded materials have been recently used in a variety of applications as promising replacements for conventional coatings. In the present study, a <b>hybrid</b> <b>coating</b> <b>system</b> taking advantage of graded composition concept is proposed to enhance the through-thickness stress distribution within a double-sided coated circular thick homogeneous plate. The coating system is composed of two main layers: an external homogeneous layer and an interlayer between the external layer and the plate, with graded material composition. All layers are modeled within the context of three-dimensional elasticity theory, and an elasto-static solution is obtained by using suitable potential functions. Accuracy and reliability of the proposed analysis is investigated by comparison with results obtained in the literature, {{as well as with the}} results of a three-dimensional finite element simulation. Comparative study shows the inherent advantages of the present <b>hybrid</b> <b>coating</b> <b>system</b> over the conventional homogeneous coating or the functionally graded coating layers...|$|E

Adding carbon and silicon atoms into CrN coatings had large effects on microstructural change and mechanical properties of CrN coatings. The hardness value of Cr-Si-C-N coatings showed about 44 GPa, while those of Cr-Si-N and Cr-C-N coatings were 34 and 23 GPa, respectively.

The coatings have to combine flexibility, necessary for enduring deformation of the metal substrate after coating, and hardness for improved mechanical properties. Two systems have been studied: a polyester–TEOS system and a polyester–epoxide–TEOS system. The polyester–TEOS system contains polyester oligomers which are crosslinked with silica clusters, formed via the sol-gel process. The polyester–epoxide–TEOS system consists of an organic network of polyester and epoxide with silicon compounds, formed by the sol-gel process. Both systems form transparent hybrid organic–inorganic coatings. The influence of the inorganic compound on the König hardness of the coatings is determined.

In scratch adhesion testing, the interlayer delays the onset of cracking and spallation of the film, because itprovides better mechanical support than the bare Al substrate. As soon as cracking begins, however, completedelamination of the films deposited on cermet interlayers occurs, revealing limited interface adhesion. Accordingly, in ball-on-disk wear tests, the films deposited on cermet interlayers can stand more severecontact conditions without cracking, but, as the contact pressure increases, most of the film delaminates. If no cracking occurs, the film is very effective at producing low wear and low friction, but it is not as effectiveat preventing penetration of corrosive agents, as shown by corrosion tests in aqueous environments, becauseit contains some small defects...|$|R

Hierarchical materials {{with a combination of}} micron/submicron and nanoscale features for coating of medical implants could therefore have significant potential to modulate cellular responses and eventually improve the performance of the implants. In this study, we report a simple, one pot wet chemistry preparation of a <b>hybrid</b> <b>coating</b> <b>system</b> with hierarchical surface structures consisting of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and tantalum oxide. Medical grade, amine functional PDMS was mixed with tantalum ethoxide which subsequently formed Ta 2 O 5 in situ through hydrolysis and condensation during coating process. The coatings were characterized by SEM, EDS, XPS, confocal scanning microscopy, contact angle measurement and in vitro cell culture. Varying PDMS and tantalum ethoxide ratios resulted in coatings of different surface textures ranging from smooth to submicro- and nano-structured. Strikingly, hierarchical surfaces containing both microscale (1 - 1. 5 μm) and nanoscale (86 - 163 nm) particles were found on coatings synthesized with 20 % and 40 % (v/v) tantalum ethoxide. The coatings were similar in term of hydrophobicity but showed different surface roughness and chemical composition. Importantly, higher cell proliferation was observed on hybrid surface with hierarchical structures compared to pure PDMS or pure tantalum oxide.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityCurrently, {{ceramics}} {{are being}} used under increasingly demanding environments. This research involves the study of high-temperature stability of ceramic materials in two diverse applications. The first application {{involves the use of}} ceramic materials in gas turbines. SiC/SiC ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) are increasingly being used in the hot-sections of gas turbines; and they are subject to recession of their surface if exposed to a flow of high-velocity water vapor, and to hot-corrosion when exposed to alkali salts. This research involves developing a hybrid system containing an environmental barrier coating (EBC) for protection of the CMC from chemical attack and a thermal barrier coating (TBC) that allows a steep temperature gradient across it to lower the temperature of the CMC for increased lifetimes. The EBC coating is a functionally graded mullite (3 Al 2 O 3 • 2 SiO 2) deposited by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), the TBC layer is yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) deposited by air plasma spray (APS). The <b>hybrid</b> <b>coating</b> <b>system</b> demonstrated excellent physical and chemical stability under severe thermal shock and exposure to an aggressive hot-corrosion environment. Finite element modeling showed that through-thickness cracks reduce the tensile stresses in the TBC, but also reduce the beneficial compressive stresses in the EBC, and may actually lead to the propagation of the vertical cracks into the EBC. The second application involves the formation of solar-grade silicon by an inexpensive and environmentally friendly electrochemical process using an YSZ solid oxide membrane (SOM) at elevated temperature (~ 1100 °C). The SOM membrane is exposed to a complex fluoride flux with dissolved silica, which is then electrochemically separated into silicon and oxygen. Membrane stability is crucial to ensure high efficiency and long-term performance of the SOM process. A failure model of the SOM membrane by the formation of "inner cracks" was studied, and attributed to yttrium depletion in the YSZ, which leads to phase transformation from the cubic to tetragonal phase. A series of systematic experiments were designed and performed to understand the synergistic roles of silica and YF 3 in the flux in membrane degradation. It was shown that silica attacks the SOM membrane, while YF 3 in the flux slows down the attack. The mechanism of the yttria depleted layer (YDL) formation was attributed to grain boundary attack by the silica in the flux, which was the rate-controlling step. This led to rapid ingress of the flux into this attacked grain boundaries, and the out diffusion of Y from the cubic YSZ grains to the grain boundary. This depletion of the Y from the cubic grains transformed them into tetragonal. Once all of the cubic grains in the YDL region converted to tetragonal YSZ grains, no further diffusion occurred. Based on the stability test results, a new flux design was proposed and tested. The flux composition did not attack the SOM membrane, and successful separation of silica in the flux to phase pure Si crystals was demonstrated without apparent damage to the SOM membrane, thereby demonstrating the viability of the Si-SOM process...|$|E

40|$|A {{high-throughput}} screening method for {{the exploration of}} optimal curing parameters and resistance to solvents of NANOMER® coating materials based on the temperature-dependent swellability was developed. The screening method was first tested using a model sol made of pre-hydrolyzed (3 -glycidoxypropyl) triethoxysilane (GPTES), tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), (heptadecafluoro- 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetrahydrodecyl) triethoxysilane (FTS) and zirconium complex (prepared of zirconium-tert-butoxide complexed with acetylacetonate) charged with reactive diluent trimethylolpropan-triglycidether and defined amounts of fluorescein and cured at different temperatures. Afterwards, fluorescein was extracted with sodium hydroxide solution and the optical density of the supernatant of all samples was measured at 490 nm which is sensitive to the dye concentration. The optical density (OD) correlates with the degree of curing. According to this screening a temperature C is necessary for proper curing. The time dependence of extraction reveals information on resistance against sodium hydroxide solution, i. e. alkali resistance. The time dependent extraction of fluorescein at C of coatings cured at 100 and 140 °C, respectively, shows a better resistance against 0. 1 M sodium hydroxide solution for the one cured at 140 °C, especially in the time range 10 — 60 min. The whole process — sol preparation, mixing of sols with dye, extraction, and optical spectroscopy—can be performed automatically. Further testes were made to proof the usability of this process. 96 hybrid materials were screened in regard to their alkali resistance and finally, a total number of 14 clear organic-inorganic <b>hybrid</b> <b>coating</b> <b>systems</b> with improved stability against sodium hydroxide solution were derived from this study...|$|R

40|$|Two {{kinds of}} Ni-graphite {{abradable}} <b>coating</b> <b>systems</b> (<b>coating</b> <b>system</b> A with 80 Ni 20 Al bond <b>coating</b> and <b>coating</b> <b>system</b> B with 96 NiCr- 4 Al bond coating) were prepared. The {{top and the}} bond coatings were independently deposited by different techniques of flame and plasma spraying. Corrosion behavior of the <b>coating</b> <b>systems</b> was investigated via the electrochemical and salt spray corrosion tests. Open-circuit potential and polarization tests were carried out in an oxygen-saturated 5 wt. % NaCl neutral solutions at 35 degrees C. It {{was found that the}} 80 Ni 20 Al coating exhibited the lowest corrosion resistance. Results of the salt spray corrosion (SSC) tests support a corrosion mechanism in the Ni-graphite coating being a crevice corrosion, which leads to loose corrosion products accumulated {{on the surface of the}} <b>coating</b> <b>systems.</b> For <b>coating</b> <b>system</b> A, analysis of the corrosion damage of the bonding layer showed a prevalent localized attack on intersplat boundaries. For <b>coating</b> <b>system</b> B, the bonding layer exhibited less corrosion, but the matrix of the top coating close to the interface corroded heavily due to a galvanic coupling between these two different coating layers. Experimental results after 960 h SSC tests showed that the bonding strength decreased to 3. 5 MPa and 2. 6 MPa for <b>coating</b> <b>systems</b> A and B, respectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Polysiloxane/SiO 2 hybrid {{coatings}} {{have been}} prepared on Kapton films by a sol-gel process. The erosion resistance of polysiloxane/SiO 2 (20 wt pct) coating was evaluated by exposure tests of vacuum ultraviolet radiation (VUV) and atomic oxygen beam (AO) in a ground-based simulation facility. The experimental results indicate that this coating exhibits better AO resistance than pure polysiloxane coating. The erosion yield (Ey) of the polysiloxane/SiO 2 (20 wt pct) <b>hybrid</b> <b>coating</b> is about 10 − 27 cm 3 /atom, being one or two orders of magnitude {{lower than that of}} polysiloxane. VUV radiation can affect the erosion process greatly. Under simultaneous AO and VUV exposure, the value of Ey of the polysiloxane/SiO 2 (20 wt pct) <b>hybrid</b> <b>coating</b> increases by 39 % compared with that under single AO exposure...|$|R

The theoretical part is devoted to wood durability and weather resistance with {{a detailed description of the}} tests the durability of <b>coating</b> <b>systems.</b> A substantial part of the theory is devoted to description binder component of the coating material. In the practical part was performed the experiment, which examined {{the influence of the}} thickness of the <b>coating</b> <b>system,</b> the type of coating material (paint or lasure) as well as the type of binder (water dispersion with an alkyd or acrylic resin, respectively solution <b>coating</b> <b>system</b> with the alkyd resin).
