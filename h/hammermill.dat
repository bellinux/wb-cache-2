50|$|A {{watermill}} {{or water}} mill is a mill that utilizes hydropower. It is {{a structure that}} uses a water wheel or water turbine to drive a mechanical process such as milling (grinding), rolling, or hammering. Such processes are needed {{in the production of}} many material goods, including flour, lumber, paper, textiles, and many metal products.

50|$|Roller mills are mills {{that use}} {{cylindrical}} rollers, either in opposing pairs or against flat plates, to crush or grind various materials, such as grain, ore, gravel, plastic, and others.

50|$|Sulzbach’s {{historical}} {{claim to}} fame stems from the birth of two industries of rather disproportionate importance to the village’s size. Both also sprang from the same family. The Sulzbach village smith, Johann Nikolaus Stumm (born 1669), bought up several old Hunsrück <b>hammermills</b> and ran them with such great success that he became {{the father of the}} Saarland’s smelting industry. The later “iron barons” of the family Stumm dominated and characterized the Saar region’s economic history for a good two hundred years.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hammermills</b> are impact {{grinders}} with swinging or stationary steel bars forcing ingredients {{against a}} circular screen or solid serrated section {{designated as a}} striking plate.

50|$|The {{water mill}} {{was used for}} {{grinding}} grain, producing flour for bread, malt for beer, or coarse meal for porridge. <b>Hammermills</b> used the wheel to operate hammers. One type was fulling mill, which was used for cloth making. The trip hammer was also used for making wrought iron and for working iron into useful shapes, an activity that was otherwise labour-intensive. The water wheel was also used in papermaking, beating material to a pulp. In the 13th century water mills used for hammering throughout Europe improved the productivity of early steel manufacturing. Along with the mastery of gunpowder, waterpower provided European countries worldwide military leadership from the 15th century.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in the mid-16th century, {{the working}} of iron began, first from the pits in Buhlenberg and Elchweiler, then later from Thalfang and Schwarzenbach. In 1763, owing to {{economic}} hardship, the Abentheuer Ironworks (Abentheuerer Hütte) {{passed into the}} ownership of the Stumm entrepreneurial family, which already had other ironworks and <b>hammermills</b> in the region at its disposal. After this change in ownership, production in Abentheuer rose noticeably. From 1770, the plant’s products were first and foremost cast-iron articles made from imported pig iron. In 1835, the ironworks were bequeathed to the Böcking brothers, who shut the works down in 1875 and moved them to the coal deposits and better shipping links on the Saar.|$|R
50|$|During the mid-18th century {{a number}} of forges, mills, sawmills and <b>hammermills</b> were built along the Suze river. The {{numerous}} mills and available water power attracted many blacksmiths, nailsmiths and locksmiths to the village. In 1725, the watch industry first entered the village and the craftsmen began producing watch parts. Starting in 1735, watchmaking moguls such as the Blancpain family built houses, infrastructure, factories and public areas to attract skilled craftsmen to Villeret. The completion of the Biel-Les Convers railroad in 1874 caused another population boom, which had reached its zenith by 1910. The financial crises of the 1930s and 1970s devastated the watch industry. The industry began to recover in 1993 when Cartier decided to open to factory in Villeret. This was followed in 2000 by the Straumann dental implants and instruments factory. However, in 2003, Cartier closed their factory. In 2005, the manufacturing sector makes up almost three-fourths of all jobs in the municipality.|$|R

50|$|After {{the commotion}} and {{destruction}} {{wrought by the}} Thirty Years' War and the time that followed, there was enormous growth in the demand for ironware and iron equipment. In response, new ironworks, iron and copper smelters and hammermills soon arose. As early as 1670, the Asbacher Hütte (Asbach Foundry) came into being, which drew its ore from mines near Niederwörresbach and Berschweiler, where rich iron deposits had been discovered. Joining the foundry in 1714 were the Hammer Birkenfeld - popularly called the Schippenhammer - and the steel- and <b>hammermill</b> in Sensweiler. There were also the Katzenloch <b>hammermill,</b> opened in 1758, and the Allenbach copper smelter, which in 1802 was converted to an iron <b>hammermill.</b> At the hammermills, the iron produced by the Asbach Foundry was wrought into various kinds of ironware. Besides smiths, charcoal makers and goods transporters were first and foremost needed.|$|E

40|$|Abundant {{sugarcane}} residue during {{shortage of}} roughage in dry season gives {{an opportunity to}} raise ruminants around sugarcane industries. However, these products are not widely used by farmers due to an assumption that the usage is inefficient and that the feed utilization technology is not widely recognized. Sugarcane fibrous residues (tops, bagasse and pith) may be a potential feed component if pre-treated to increase its digestion and consumption by the animal, and/or supplemented by other ingredients to balance nutrients in the rumen {{as well as those}} for production purpose. Digestibility can be increased by chemical treatments such as ammoniation and other alkaline treatments, whereas consumption can be increased by physical treatments such as grinding, <b>hammermilling</b> or pelleting. Nutrients that are missing in these fibrous residues can be provided by addition of urea, molasses and minerals for maintenance need, and bypass nutrients (carbohydrates, protein and fats) that are digested in the small intestine and available for tissue or milk synthesis. There are three options for development of livestock agribusiness based on fibrous sugarcane residues; however, these require several technologies to optimize the utilization of these residues...|$|R
