5|$|In another case, 28-year-old British student Nathan Layton was {{bitten by}} a black mamba and {{died of a heart}} attack in less than an hour in March 2008. The black mamba had been found near a {{classroom}} at the Southern African Wildlife College in Hoedspruit, where Layton was training to be a safari guide. Layton was bitten by the snake on <b>his</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> while it was being put into a jar, but he didn't realize he'd been bitten. He thought the snake had only brushed his hand. Approximately 30 minutes after being bitten Layton complained of blurred vision. He collapsed and {{died of a heart attack}}, nearly an hour after being bitten. Attempts to revive him failed, and he was pronounced dead at the scene.|$|E

5|$|Ba Cụt {{was born}} circa 1923 in Long Xuyên, a {{regional}} {{town in the}} Mekong Delta, in the far south of Vietnam. He was orphaned {{at an early age}} and adopted by a local peasant family. Ba Cụt was illiterate and was known from childhood as a temperamental and fiery person. The family's rice paddies were confiscated by a prominent landlord, the father of Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ. Ba Cụt's bitter personal experience imbued him with a permanent and fanatical hatred towards landowners. Thơ rose to become a leading politician in the 1950s and {{played a key role in}} Ba Cụt's eventual capture and execution. An aura of mystery surrounded Ba Cụt during his life, and foreign journalists incorrectly reported that he had severed his finger as part of a vow to defeat the French. As Ba Cụt became more fanatical in his religious beliefs and spent increasing time with local religious men, Ba Cụt's father demanded that he work more in the family's rice fields. A defiant Ba Cụt severed <b>his</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger,</b> which was necessary for work in the rice paddies.|$|E

25|$|Tattersall had {{an unusual}} style, quite {{different}} from the orthodox Jim Laker, who kept him out of a Test place for most of his career. Tattersall held <b>his</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> around the seam of the ball and this allowed him to bowl a carefully disguised away-swinger to supplement his sharp off-break. He was rather faster than Laker, and this served to increase his penetration on the many wet wickets of his home county. Of small account as a batsman, he did nonetheless help Reg Simpson in a tenth wicket stand of 74 which helped to give England its first victory over Australia since their record win at The Oval in 1938.|$|E

500|$|Barrett missed {{almost half}} of the 2003 on account of three injuries. He {{suffered}} the first during a game against the Colorado Rockies, during which one of Steve Reed's pitches accidentally hit and bruised Barrett's index finger. Barrett was able to continue playing, but claimed the injury had hindered his playing performance. He eventually managed to overcome the injury in July. He recorded a batting average of [...]333 and fifteen RBI. During this period, Barrett began to complain about tightness in his right hip flexor. This ailment took its toll on Barrett during a game against the Atlanta Braves, when he strained the muscles while taking a checked swing. The Expos sent Barrett on a rehabilitation assignment to play with the Edmonton Trappers, a AAA team from the Pacific Coast League. He only managed to play two games with team before fracturing <b>his</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> on August 9.

500|$|The Portland {{sculpture}} is one {{of seven}} casts of John Seward Johnson II's Allow Me. It was designed and completed by Johnson in 1983 and is constructed from bronze, aluminum and stainless steel. In 1984, the sculpture was donated anonymously, but {{in the name of}} Harry H. Schwartz, to the City of Portland and dedicated for display at Pioneer Courthouse Square. This square {{is one of}} the most popular and often visited squares in the state of Oregon. In 2004 the square was named the fourth best public square in the world by New York's Project for Public Spaces. Allow Me is situated on the south side of the Square just above the amphitheatre and is seen as welcoming visitors there. The sculpture depicts a life-sized man dressed in a business suit, [...] "hurrying across the square" [...] and hailing a cab. He holds an umbrella, which some people have interpreted as an offering. He wears a watch and a rhubarb-colored tie; <b>his</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> points towards the Meier & Frank Building, adjacent to the Square.
