40|$|Because {{enforcement}} of forestry law has become extremely difficult in Indonesia, a <b>ban</b> on <b>export</b> of logs {{has been suggested}} {{as a means of}} controlling over-harvest and illegal logging. A model of a log <b>export</b> <b>ban</b> can help us visualize its effects on the forestry sector. The model consists of simplified overviews of the wood processing sector, demand - price feedback loops, forest standing stock and log availability, log harvest capacity, and log exports. It examines important feedbacks that must be understood if the potential costs and benefits of a log <b>export</b> <b>ban</b> are to be properly considered. Although some scenarios can help reduce log harvests to sustainable levels, others encourage expansion of small domestic milling capacity leading to increased log harvests. Excess domestic milling capacity added during a log <b>export</b> <b>ban</b> may continue to operate even after a log <b>export</b> <b>ban</b> is lifted. For a log <b>export</b> <b>ban</b> to be an effective tool in combating over-harvest and illegal harvest, limits must also be placed on possible increases in domestic milling and logging capacity...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} price effects on crude oils of {{removing}} the U. S. <b>export</b> <b>ban</b> on Alaskan North Slope crude oil in 1996. We estimate the longrun impact of removing the <b>export</b> <b>ban</b> {{through the use of}} a time series intervention analysis. The results indicate that Alaskan crude oil prices increased between $ 0. 98 and $ 1. 30 on the West Coast spot market relative to prices of comparable crude oils as a result of removing the <b>export</b> <b>ban.</b> However, we find no evidence that West Coast prices for refined oil products-regular unleaded gasoline, diesel fuel, and jet fuel increased as a result of lifting the ban. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} case for an <b>export</b> <b>ban</b> on {{intermediate}} goods which generate environmental damage. Since export restrictions on intermediates have long been advocated {{as a method of}} stimulating domestic industries in developing countries, we consider whether {{the case for}} an <b>export</b> <b>ban</b> is strengthened or weakened by the presence of unemployment in the industrial sector. We find that, in the short run, an export restriction worsens unemployment, thus weakening the case for a ban. In the long run, however, the results are reversed. If the environmental problem is severe, unemployment has a negligible impact on the case for an <b>export</b> <b>ban.</b> Copyright 1997 by Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|R

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of tropical timber-producing nations have enacted <b>bans</b> on <b>export</b> of logs arguing that this will reduce deforestation, expand downstream wood processing and improve the scale efficiency of domestic processing, create jobs and retain more value-added nationally. The theoretical literature is clear that trade restrictions are generally welfare reducing (except in special cases such as {{when there is a}} potential for an optimal export tax). At best, a log <b>export</b> <b>ban</b> is a second-best policy tool for reducing deforestation and addressing the associated environmental externalities. In overall terms, the suggestion that log <b>export</b> <b>bans</b> can achieve the objectives expected of them is dubious. However, very little quantitative evidence exists to demonstrate this claim and the paper attempts to address this gap by looking at the economic and environmental impacts of eliminating a log <b>export</b> <b>ban</b> in Costa Rica. The authors argue that eliminating the <b>export</b> <b>ban</b> is Pareto improving and could generate economic gains as high as $ 14 million per annum with the possibility of relatively modest environmental benefits.

Some studies pointed to the crude oil <b>export</b> <b>ban</b> as the main culprit for this divergence, but pipeline capacity was also scarce during this time. To understand the drivers of domestic crude oil discounts, we decompose domestic price differentials for multiple crudes into the contributions of shipping and export constraints. We find that scarce pipeline capacity explains the majority of the deviation of mid-continent crude oil prices from their long-run relationship with Brent crude, while refining changes explain very little.

We find that restricting rail loads or increasing pipeline capacity from areas driving production will significantly reduce rail movements. However, lifting the United States crude oil <b>export</b> <b>ban</b> in isolation will only increase rail transportation volumes.
