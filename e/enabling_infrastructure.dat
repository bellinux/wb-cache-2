5000|$|On {{the eastern}} flank, the first {{area to be}} built on will be 'Broughton Gate' (bounded by Broughton, Kingston and the A5130). This will include an {{extension}} to the H7 Chaffron Way grid road {{as far as the}} A5130, but will not continue on to pick up Salford Road and its M1 crossing, thus impeding any further expansion east of the M1. (The plan actually proposes that Salford Road be downgraded to a Redway, closing it to other traffic. A second M1 crossing, Broughton Grounds Lane, is ignored completely [...] - [...] though in the planning application for the <b>enabling</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> the existence of the lane has been reinstated.) After this the area to the east of the A5130 as far as the M1 motorway and bounded on the south by the A421 will be developed in parts as a residential and industrial estate. The H7 will again extend east through this area, as a city street, turning south upon meeting another city street and meeting the A421. Along the A421 a new employment complex named 'Nova' is planned. Whilst acknowledging the benefit of the grid system, the plan explicitly rules out any role for the former A5130 as a V12 grid route and the development map shows that HGVs will not be permitted to use it.|$|E

40|$|This project {{examines}} {{the process of}} planning, management and allocation of resources required {{for the implementation of}} the Ugandan Universal Primary Education program. It commences with an introduction to the UPE program along with a detailed highlight of major education statistics in Uganda. It also highlights the importance of the UPE and aligns it with the global and in-country millennium development goal aimed at ensuring that the world’s children are able to complete a full course of primary schooling by 2015. The literature review encompasses a utilization of the basic economic province of the 5 W’s and H, and uses it to link with the research question in order to generate the theories models and concepts necessary to analysing the issues and problems which is dependent on data gathered from primary first hand sources involved with the allocation of resources relevant to the Implementation of the UPE program. Details are presented on the internal stakeholders of the programs implementation which primarily include the Information and Documentation Centre within the Ministry of Education and Sports in Uganda. From utilizing concepts of stakeholder interaction and IT business process modelling, it is found that the IDC serves as the main unit as all inbound and outbound information concerned with the Primary education implementation lays in the units’ control. The Minister of state for primary education serves as the direct overseer of the program, but delegates’ majority of the implementation duties to the IDC. This concentration of control proves to be detrimental as request for resources made by the dependent stakeholders end-up inheriting a unilateral flow of information and execution from request to execution. The poor state of the paper based ICT <b>enabled</b> <b>infrastructure</b> utilized by both internal and external stakeholders also proves incapable of handling the planning for the allocation of required resources thus leading to the need for improved ICT <b>enabled</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> and processes driven by IT to develop on the implementation of the program especially the execution of requests made by external stakeholders for much needed consumable, welfare and infrastructural resources. Conclusions are made to justify the relevance of ICT <b>enabled</b> <b>infrastructure</b> as well as IT driven processes including the potential for value addition. It is found that the benefits of using IT driven processes can help in discovering other problems that exist from in depth analysis often yielding in the need to change existing processes to align with goals set-up by the managers of the program...|$|R
