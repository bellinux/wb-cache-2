40|$|We {{present the}} {{discovery}} of a light echo from SN 2007 af, a normal Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) in NGC 5584. Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images taken three years post explosion reveal two separate echoes; an outer echo and extended central region, which we propose as an unresolved inner echo. Multiple images were obtained in the F 160 W, F 350 LP, F 555 W, and F 814 W using the Wide Field Camera 3. If the outer echo is produced by an interstellar <b>dust</b> <b>sheet</b> perpendicular to the line of sight, it is located ~ 800 pc in front of the SN. The dust for the inner echo is 0. 45 pc < d < 90 pc away from the SN. The inner echo color is consistent with typical interstellar dust wavelength-dependent scattering cross-sections, while the outer echo color does not match the predictions. Both dust sheets, if in the foreground, are optically thin for scattering, with the outer echo sheet thickness consistent with the inferred extinction from peak brightness. Whether the inner echo is from interstellar or circumstellar dust is ambiguous. Overall, the echo characteristics are quite similar to previously observed SN Ia echoes.

40|$|The {{results of}} a spectroscopic {{programme}} aiming to investigate the kinematics of the local interstellar medium components towards the Southern Coalsack and Chamaeleon-Musca dark clouds are presented. The analysis is based upon high-resolution (R ≈ 60 000) spectra of the insterstellar NaI D absorption lines towards 63 B-type stars (d � 500 pc) selected to cover these clouds and the connecting area defined by the Galactic coordinates: 308 ◦ � l � 294 ◦ and − 22 ◦ � b � 5 ◦. The radial velocities, column densities, velocity dispersions, colour excess and photometric distances to the stars are used to understand the kinematics and distribution of the interstellar cloud components. The analysis indicates that the interstellar gas is distributed in two extended sheet-like structures permeating the whole area, one at d � 60 pc and another around 120 - 150 pc from the Sun.

30|$|GALEX has {{detected}} ultraviolet halos extending {{as far as}} 5 ° {{around four}} bright stars (Murthy and Henry, 2011). These halos are produced by scattering of starlight by dust grains in thin foreground clouds that are not physically associated with the star. Assuming a simple model consisting of a single layer of dust {{in front of the}} star, Murthy and Henry (2011) have been able to model these halo intensities and constrain the value of the phase function asymmetry factor g of the scattering grains in the FUV and NUV. However due to the uncertainty in the dust geometry they could not constrain the albedo. In this work we have tried to constrain the optical constants and dust geometry by modeling the UV halo of Spica. Since the halo emission is not symmetric, we have modeled the Northern and Southern parts of the halo separately. To the North of Spica, the best-fit albedo is 0.26 ± 0.1 and g is 0.58 ± 0.11 in the FUV at the 90 % confidence level. The corresponding limits on the distance and optical depth (τ) of the <b>dust</b> <b>sheet</b> is 3.65 ± 1.05 pc and 0.047 ± 0.006 respectively. However, owing to a complicated dust distribution to the South of Spica, we were unable to uniquely constrain the dust parameters in that region. Nevertheless, by assuming the optical constants of the Northern region and assuming a denser medium, we were able to constrain the distance of the dust to 9.5 ± 1.5 pc and the corresponding τ to 0.04 ± 0.01.|$|E
40|$|GRB 090417 B was {{an unusually}} long burst with a T(sub 90) {{duration}} {{of at least}} 2130 s and a multi-peaked light curve at energies of 15 - 150 keV. It was optically dark and has been convincingly associated with a bright star-forming galaxy at a redshift of 0. 345 that is broadly similar to the Milky Way. This {{is one of the}} few cases where a host galaxy has been clearly identified for a dark gamma-ray burst and thus an ideal candidate for studying the origin of dark bursts. We find that the dark nature of GRB 090417 B can not be explained by high redshift, incomplete observations, or unusual physics in the production of the afterglow. The Swift/XRT X-ray data are consistent with the afterglow being obscured by a dense, localized sheet of dust approximately 30 - 80 pc from the burst along the line of sight. Assuming the standard relativistic fireball model for the afterglow we find that the optical flux is at least 2. 5 mag fainter than predicted by the X -ray flux. We are able to explain the lack of an optical afterglow, and the evolution of the X -ray spectrum, by assuming that there is a sheet of dust along the line of sight approximately 30 - 80 pc from the progenitor. Our results suggest that this <b>dust</b> <b>sheet</b> imparts an extinction of A(sub v) > or = 12 mag, which is sufficient to explain the missing optical flux. GRB 090417 B is an example of a gamma-ray burst that is dark due to the localized dust structure in its host galaxy...|$|E
40|$|We present {{observations}} of the uranian ring system at a wavelength of 2. 2 μm, taken between 2003 and 2008 with NIRC 2 on the W. M. Keck telescope in Hawaii, and on 15 - 17 August 2007 with NaCo on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile. Of particular interest are the data taken {{around the time of}} the uranian ring plane crossing with Earth on 16 August 2007, and with the Sun (equinox) on 7 December 2007. We model the data at the different viewing aspects with a Monte Carlo model to determine: (1) the normal optical depth τ 0, the location, and the radial extent of the main rings, and (2) the parameter Aτ 0 (A is the particle geometric albedo), the location, and the radial plus vertical extent of the dusty rings. Our main conclusions are: (i) The brightness of the ∊ ring is significantly enhanced at small phase and ring inclination angles; we suggest this extreme opposition effect to probably be dominated by a reduction in interparticle shadowing. (ii) A broad sheet of dust particles extends inwards from the λ ring almost to the planet itself. This <b>dust</b> <b>sheet</b> has a vertical extent of ∼ 140 km, and Aτ 0 = 2. 2 × 10 − 6. (iii) The dusty rings between ring 4 and the α ring and between the α and β rings are vertically extended with a thickness of ∼ 300 km. (iv) The ζ ring extends from ∼ 41, 350 km almost all the way inwards to the planet. The main ζ ring, centered at ∼ 39, 500 km from the planet, is characterized by Aτ 0 = 3. 7 × 10 − 6; this parameter decreases closer to the planet. The ζ ring has a full vertical extent of order 800 - 900 km, with a pronounced density enhancement in the mid-plane.

40|$|Simple {{theoretical}} calculations {{have suggested}} that small body impacts onto Pluto’s newly discovered small satellites, Nix and Hydra, are capable of generating time-variable rings or <b>dust</b> <b>sheets</b> in the Pluto system. We present the first observational constraints on the present-day optical depth of such debris systems using HST/ACS data obtained on 2006 February 15 and 2006 March 2. We find that any Plutonian dust rings between Nix and Hydra must have optical depths of 2 x 10 − 5 or lower, when averaged over 1000 -km radial distance scales. While usefully constraining, the derived ring optical depth limits are still a factor of four higher than those predicted by Stern et al. (2006 a). Were the New Horizons spacecraft to fly through a ring system with optical depth as high as 2 x 10 − 5, it would collide with {{a significant number of}} potentially damaging ring particles.

40|$|The gamma-ray burst (GRB) / X-ray flash (XRF) events GRB 031203, {{discovered}} by INTEGRAL, and XRF 060218, {{discovered by}} Swift, represent two of only five GRB-SNe with optical spectroscopic confirmation of their SN components. Yet their observed high-energy properties offer a sharp contrast: While GRB 031203 was detected as a short 40 -s burst with a spectrum peaking at E_peak > 190 keV, XRF 060218 was a T_ 90 ~ 2100 -s long, smoothly-evolving burst with peak energy E_peak = 4. 9 keV. At the same time, {{the properties of}} the two expanding dust-scattered X-ray halos observed in a fast-response XMM-Newton observation of GRB 031203 reveal that this event was accompanied by an "X-ray blast" with fluence comparable to or greater than that of the prompt gamma-ray event. Taking this observation as our starting point, we investigate the likely properties of the X-ray blast from GRB 031203 via detailed modeling of the XMM data, discovering a third halo due to scattering off a more distant <b>dust</b> <b>sheet</b> at d_ 3 = 9. 94 +/- 0. 39 kpc, and constraining the timing of the X-ray blast relative to the GRB trigger time to be t_ 0 = 11 +/- 417 s. Using our constraints, we compare the properties of GRB 031203 to those of other GRB-SNe {{in order to understand the}} likely nature of its X-ray blast, concluding that a bright X-ray flare, as in GRB 050502 B, or shock breakout event, as in XRF 060218, provide the most likely explanations. In the latter case, we consider the added possibility that XRF 060218 may have manifested an episode of bright gamma-ray emission prior to the burst observed by Swift, in which case GRB 031203 and XRF 060218 would be "cosmic twin" explosions with nearly identical high-energy properties.

40|$|Brown’s Vorticity Transport Model, {{coupled to}} an {{additional}} particle transport model, {{is used to}} simulate {{the development of the}} dust cloud that can form around a helicopter when operating in dusty or desert conditions. The flow field around a tandem rotor configuration is simulated during the final stages of landing. The time-averaged flow field around the helicopter is characterised by the existence of two stationary points immediately adjacent to the ground plane. Almost all entrainment of dust into the flow takes place forward of the rearmost stationary point; the dust initially remains in a thin, sheet-like layer above the ground. As the <b>dust</b> <b>sheet</b> approaches the forward stationary point, the layer thickens and forms a characteristic wedge-shaped ‘separation zone’. The amount of sand that is subsequently drawn up away from the ground then appears to be critically dependent on the strength and position relative to the separation zone of strong regions of recirculation. VTM simulations suggest that, for a tandem rotor helicopter at least, the sudden growth of the dust cloud that is responsible for the onset of brownout may be due to a change in mode within the flow field surrounding the aircraft. At higher advance ratios the flow is dominated by a strong ground vortex that is created by the rear rotor. The forward extent of the resultant dust cloud is limited though by the absence of any strong recirculation within the flow below the front rotor of the system. At lower forward speed the ground vortex of the rear rotor is replaced by a strong vortex that lies just below {{the leading edge of the}} front rotor. This vortex is responsible for drawing a significant amount of dust out of the surface layer of entrained particulates to form a dense wall of dust some distance upstream of the helicopter. A study of the effect of blade twist on the strength and shape of the dust cloud formed in the flow surrounding helicopters with tandem rotors suggests that systems with smaller blade twist but the same disc loading might produce denser dust clouds than those with high blade twist...|$|E
40|$|Simple {{theoretical}} calculations {{have suggested}} that small body impacts onto Pluto's newly discovered small satellites, Nix and Hydra, are capable of generating time-variable rings or <b>dust</b> <b>sheets</b> in the Pluto system. Using HST/ACS data obtained on 2006 February 15 and 2006 March 2, we find no observational evidence for such a ring system and present the first constraints on the present-day I/F and optical depth of a putative ring system. At the 1500 -km radial resolution of our search, we place a 3 -sigma upper limit on the azimuthally-averaged normal I/F of ring particles of 5. 1 x 10 ^- 7 {{at a distance of}} 42, 000 km from the Pluto-Charon barycenter, the minimum distance for a dynamically stable ring (Stern et al., 1994; Nagy et al., 2006); 4. 4 x 10 ^- 7 at the orbit of Nix; and 2. 5 x 10 ^- 7 at the orbit of Hydra. For an assumed ring particle albedo of 0. 04 (0. 38), these I/F limits translate into 3 -sigma upper limits on the normal optical depth of macroscopic ring particles of 1. 3 x 10 ^- 5 (1. 4 x 10 ^- 6), 1. 1 x 10 ^- 5 (1. 2 x 10 ^- 6), 6. 4 x 10 ^- 6 (6. 7 x 10 ^- 7), respectively. Were the New Horizons spacecraft to fly through a ring system with optical depth of 1. 3 x 10 ^- 5, it would collide with a significant number of potentially damaging ring particles. We therefore recommend that unless tighter constraints can be obtained, New Horizons cross the putative ring plane within 42, 000 km of the Pluto-Charon barycenter, where rings are dynamically unstable. We derive a crude estimate of the lifetime of putative ring paritcles of 900 years. Comment: 14 pages, including 3 figures and 2 table...|$|R

Investigators later suggested two possible causes; one that a spark had jumped from the fire to the dust sheets; the other that a jackdaw’s nest in the chimney had fallen down scattering burning embers over the room. The caretaker raised the alarm, and although Joseph Berwick, surveyor to the Aspatria Urban District Council and Captain of the volunteer Fire Brigade was immediately at hand, to combat the flames, his efforts failed to prevent the catastrophe. The furniture in the centre of the room was blazing like a bonfire and within minutes the ceiling collapsed and although the staff attached the Fire hoses and began to tackle the blaze they could not prevent it spreading. The Aspatria Fire Brigade arrived with an army of local volunteers only to find that the strong wind was fanning the flames along the south and west wings. Although the Workington engine promptly arrived in the vicinity someone misdirected the driver and the heavy engine sank in the soft earth where it remained for over two hours. The polished floors, the lath and plaster walls, and the wood furniture offered the fire sufficient fuel, causing the roof to collapse and the flames to shoot into the air. Upon realising that they could not save the south and west wings, they concentrated on saving the north wing. They stripped the roof, tore down the woodwork and prevented the fire from travelling further. So quickly did the fire spread that they lost everything in the Drawing Room, the Maple, the Ash, the Bamboo and Ebony Rooms. However they saved the most valuable furniture housed in the Sheraton Room, in addition to the books in the Library and the contents of the Billiard room. A further calamity occurred after helpers hastily deposited the salvaged articles in the open space; where heavy rain caused further damage. Two John Hoppner paintings valued at £5,000 each were burnt, as were the portraits of the tenth baronet and his wife Anne by the same artist. They also lost the armour belonging to the same baronet. At 9.00pm they had the fire under control. On the following day many onlookers assembled to survey the damage.|$|R
30|$|The {{mattress}} is {{only one}} of many contributing products dictating the magnitude of a bedroom fire. A bedroom frequently contains a bed covered with bedclothes (e.g., blankets, <b>sheets,</b> <b>dust</b> covers, and pillows), carpet, draperies, other furniture, and items that may be found both on and adjacent to the bed (e.g., toys, stuffed animals, and clothes). The purpose of requiring a conservative heat release metric for mattresses is to reduce the probability of a mattress-initiated fire spreading to other components in the room or a fire on one of the other items in the room igniting the mattress. Ultimately, the degree with which a mattress becomes involved and the severity of the fire will depend not only on the flammability of the mattress, but also on the flammability of other items on and near the bed, which may or may not have to meet flammability requirements. For example, a recent study showed that the bedclothes, including sheets, comforter and blanket, on a queen size or larger mattress set are sufficient to take a standard room to flashover (> 1, 000 [*]kW HRR) ([Ohlemiller & Gann 2003]). To date, there are no US federal flammability regulations for bedclothes.|$|R
40|$|Closed accessThe {{effect of}} dust on {{photovoltaic}} modules is investigated {{with respect to}} concentration and spectral transmittance. Samples were collected {{in the form of}} raw dust as well as accumulated <b>dust</b> on exposed <b>sheets</b> of glass at different tilt angles. Spectral transmittance of the samples was determined. Transmittance variation between top, middle and bottom was identified for samples collected at different inclinations, where the worst case was seen at a tilt angle of 30 o with a non-uniformity of 4. 4 % in comparison with 0. 2 % for the 90 ° tilt. The measured data showed a decrease in transmittance at wavelengths < 570 nm. Integrating this with measured spectral responses of different technologies demonstrates that wide band-gap thin-film technologies are affected more than, for example crystalline silicon technologies. The worst case is amorphous silicon, where a 33 % reduction in photocurrent is predicted for a dust concentration of 4. 25 mg/cm 2. Similarly, crystalline silicon and CIGS technologies are predicted to be less affected, with 28. 6 % and 28. 5 % reductions in photocurrent, respectively. The same procedure was repeated with varying Air Mass (AM), tilt angle and dust concentration values to produce a soiling ratio table for different technologies under different AM, tilt angle and dust concentration values...|$|R
