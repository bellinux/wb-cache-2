50|$|Examples {{of models}} based on {{expected}} physical behavior of damage are by Ismail et al. (1990), who modeled the rectangular edge defect as a spring, by Ostachowicz and Krawczuk (1991), who modeled the damage as an elastic hinge and by Thompson (1949), who modeled the damage as a concentrated couple at {{the location of}} the damage. Other models based on expected physical behavior are by Joshi and Madhusudhan (1991), who modeled the damage as a zone with reduced Young’s modulus and by Ballo (1999), who modeled it as spring with nonlinear stiffness. Krawczuk (2002) used an extensional spring at the damage location, with its flexibility determined using the stress intensity factors KI. Approximate methods to model the crack are by Chondros et al. (1998), who used a so-called crack function as an additional term in the axial displacement of Euler-Bernoulli beams. The crack functions were determined using stress intensity factors KI, KII and KIII. Christides and Barr (1984) used the Rayleigh-Ritz method, Shen and Pierre (1990) used the Galerkin Method, and Qian et al. (1991) used a Finite Element Model to predict the behavior of a beam with an <b>edge</b> <b>crack.</b> Law and Lu (2005) used assumed modes and modeled the crack mathematically as a Dirac delta function.Wang and Qiao (2007) approximated the modal displacements using Heaviside’s function, which meant that modal displacements were discontinuous at the crack location.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{interaction}} of multiple <b>edge</b> <b>cracks</b> in a semi-infinite plate is considered. The problem is formulated as a system of hypersingular integral equations using the stress field due to a force doublet as a fundamental solution. In the numerical calculations, unknown functions are approximated by fundamental density functions and Chebyshev polynomials. First, two <b>edge</b> <b>cracks</b> A and B having different crack lengths and inclination angles are analyzed {{and the effect of}} crack B upon crack A is investigated. The stress intensity factor (SIF) of crack A is found to be almost constant independent of inclination angle B if the tip of crack B is fixed. Second, periodic <b>edge</b> <b>cracks</b> are systematically analyzed varying the number, distance and angle of cracks. The interaction effect is found to occur mostly due to the distance independent of the angle. Analytical results are also shown when crack parameters are changed slightly from average values in almost equally spaced multiple <b>edge</b> <b>cracks...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractCrack {{bifurcation}} {{is observed}} in laminar ceramics that contain large residual compressive stress. In such composites, alternating material layers have tensile and compressive residual stress, due to thermal expansion mismatch or other sources. The compressive stress ensures that crack growth leading to {{failure in the}} laminar system is mediated by threshold strength, but, in some cases, it also leads to bifurcation of the propagating flaw. The phenomenon of bifurcation takes place when the crack tip is propagating in the compressive layer, and occurs typically at a distance equal to a few laminate thicknesses below the free surface and beyond. The observation of this phenomenon is usually associated {{with the presence of}} <b>edge</b> <b>cracking</b> in the compressive layers of the laminar ceramic, although it can also occur in the absence of such <b>edge</b> <b>cracks.</b> In the few cases where bifurcation occurs without <b>edge</b> <b>cracks,</b> the residual stresses and layer thicknesses are close to the condition in which <b>edge</b> <b>cracks</b> will occur. In addition, in this case the bifurcation is confined to near the specimen free surface, and below the bifurcation plane, the cracks are straight. The energy release rates for the straight and bifurcated cracks are calculated from the results of finite element computations and compared. When <b>edge</b> <b>cracking</b> is ignored, the crack is simulated as a through-thickness crack in an infinite body, and the energy release rate is used to predict crack deviation and bifurcation. Based on this, the finite element model successfully predicts bifurcation in only one material combination that was investigated in experiments. However, the experimental bifurcation takes place in two additional material combinations. When the effect of <b>edge</b> <b>cracking</b> is incorporated into the finite element simulations, the energy release rate calculations successfully predict the phenomenon of bifurcation in three material combinations, as observed in the experiments. Since no <b>edge</b> <b>cracks</b> are present in the fourth material combination tested experimentally, its lack of bifurcations is automatically predicted by the model. The presence of <b>edge</b> <b>cracking,</b> or its incipience, is thus concluded to be critical to the occurrence of crack bifurcation in laminar ceramic composites...|$|R

In this study, an experimental and mechanical investigation on microstructures {{has been carried}} out to study the <b>edge</b> <b>crack</b> formation during cold rolling of the thin strip. The effects of the feed material microstructures on the <b>edge</b> <b>crack</b> evolution were studied employing optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Experimental observation indicates that fine grain occurs in hot-rolled microstructure and coarse grain is produced in ferritic rolled microstructure. Different grain sizes affect significantly the formation mechanics of the microcrack, crack initiation, and orientation of crack extension. The grain size and grain boundaries effects on crack retardation are discussed also during <b>edge</b> <b>crack</b> initiation. During the crack growth in coarse grain, most <b>edge</b> <b>crack</b> tips will blunt, which improves the crack toughness by causing less stress concentration. Overall, the fine microstructure shows a good crack initiation resistance, whereas the coarse microstructure has a better resistance to crack propagation. This research provides additional understanding of the mechanism of microstructure influence on <b>edge</b> <b>crack</b> evolution of cold strip rolling, which could be helpful for developing defect-free thin strip...|$|E

50|$|<b>Edge</b> <b>cracking</b> is the {{formation}} of crescent-shaped <b>cracks</b> near the <b>edge</b> of a road. It is caused by lack of support of the road edge, sometimes due to poorly drained or weak shoulders. If left untreated, additional cracks will form until it resembles fatigue cracking. Like wheel-path fatigue cracking, poor drainage is a main cause of <b>edge</b> <b>cracking,</b> as it weakens the base, which hastens {{the deterioration of the}} pavement. Water ponding (a buildup of water which can also be called puddling) happens more frequently near the edge than {{in the center of the}} road path, as roads are usually sloped to prevent in-lane ponding. This leads to excess moisture in the shoulders and subbase at the road <b>edge.</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>cracking</b> differs from fatigue cracking in that the cracks form from the top down, where fatigue cracks usually start at the bottom and propagate to the surface.|$|R

40|$|Beams with {{a central}} <b>edge</b> <b>crack,</b> {{as well as other}} noncentral {{vertical}} and inclined edge cracks distributed symmetrically, subjected to three-point as well as four-point bending, are analysed using the finite element technique. Values of stress intensity factor K 1 at the central crack tip for a crack-to-beam depth ratio Image equal to 0. 5, are calculated for various cracked-beam configurations, using the compliance calibration technique as well as method of strain energy release rate. These are compared with the value of K 1 for the case of a beam with central <b>edge</b> <b>crack</b> alone. Results of the present parametric study are used to specify the range of values pertaining to basic parameters such as crack-to-beam depth ratios, geometry and position with respect to central <b>edge</b> <b>crack,</b> of other macrocracks for which interaction exists.

40|$|During {{planetary}} {{hot rolling}} of 304 austenitic stainless steel, cracks are formed along the plate edges. In order {{to explain the}} mechanism of <b>edge</b> <b>cracking,</b> the metallographical quantitative analysis of microstructural inhomogeneity of steel plates containing <b>edge</b> <b>cracks</b> of different intensities is performed. The austenitic matrix of the steel contained small amounts of delta ferrite inhomogeneously distributed across the width and {{the thickness of the}} plate. A correlation was found between ferrite content and edge cracking: the higher the ferrite content the longer the <b>edge</b> <b>cracks.</b> Among the chemical elements present in the steel, the most critical effect on delta ferrite content was exerted by carbon and nitrogen are a powerful gamma phase stabilizers at high temperature. To understand the effects of reheating parameters on the morphology and content of delta ferrite, the specimens selected from different locations of as-cast 304 stainless steel slab, were reheated according to the temperature profiles, which simulated the industrial reheating process before hot rolling. In general, reheating reduced the delta ferrite content, increased the size of the individual ferrite island and changed its shape to a more spherical. An increase of reheating time to 92 minutes caused drastic reduction in delta ferrite content and its further spherodization. Moreover, the size of the individual ferrite islands decreased. A possible, contribution of steel chemistry and reheating parameters to changes in the steel microstructure and the possibility of <b>edge</b> <b>cracking,</b> is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{replacement}} of asbestos fibres with cellulose fibres in producing corrugated fibre reinforced cement sheets by the Hatschek process resulted in <b>edge</b> <b>cracking</b> for stacked sheets. This {{was due to}} the hydrophilic nature of cellulose, which increases its tendency for exchanging water with the surroundings. The drying process of corrugated sheets, in a stack, resulted in shrinkage hence <b>edge</b> <b>cracking</b> along the sheet. To reduce the magnitude of drying shrinkage and <b>edge</b> <b>cracking</b> potential, several mitigation strategies were proposed including the surface treatment of cellulose fibres, incorporation of wollastonite microfibres, addition of admixtures and superplasticizers, kaolin inclusion as partial {{replacement of}} cement and different exposure conditions. A fundamental understanding in mechanisms behind volume changes and how cracks form was crucial for optimization of the mitigation strategies. This thesis initially used a review approach to understand the mechanisms involved in different types of shrinkage and the role of different mitigation techniques. The ultimate goal was to achieve lower drying shrinkage and cracking risks in corrugated sheets along with reducing its economic impact. As a result, surface treatment of cellulose fibres, based on transforming the hydrophilic nature of cellulose to hydrophobic state, was investigated. Furthermore, inclusion of wollastonite/ kaolin as partial replacement of cement, were evaluated. Also, the potential of adding admixtures/ superplasticizers was explored. Finally, investigation on development of <b>edge</b> <b>cracks</b> in stacked corrugated fibrecement sheets was conducted under different exposure conditions. The results and findings of this research showed no significant improvement in permeability with cellulose surface treatment. Wollastonite microfibres promoted pore discontinuity hence significant reduction in permeability thus lower drying shrinkage. However, the resultant sheets were brittle. By reducing water content with addition of superplasticizers, density was enhanced thus reducing volume change from drying and wetting. Kaolin acted as internal restraint for shrinkage, refining the microstructure at the interfacial transition zone thus increasing density and its pozzolanic reaction enhanced mechanical properties. The inclusion of kaolin in the fibrecement mix in conjunction with controlling exposure conditions managed to eliminate <b>edge</b> <b>cracking...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to extend the investigation into a method to represent and analyze the stress field around two parallel <b>edge</b> <b>cracks</b> in a finite body. The Westergaard-Schwarz method combined with the local collocation method was used to analyze different cases of two parallel <b>edge</b> <b>cracks</b> in a finite body. Using this method a determination of when two parallel <b>edge</b> <b>cracks</b> could be analyzed as isolated single <b>edge</b> <b>cracks</b> was determined Numerical experimentation was conducted using ABAQUS. It was used to obtain the coordinate and stress information required in the local collocation method. The numerical models were created by maintaining one crack at a fixed length while varying the length of the second crack as well as the separation distance of the two cracks. The results obtained through the local collocation method were compared with the finite element obtained J-Integrals to verify the accuracy of the results. The results obtained in the analysis showed that the major factor in determining when the second crack?s stress field has to be considered was the crack separation distance. It was found that a reduction in the second crack?s length did not {{have a significant effect on}} overall stress intensity factors of the fixed crack. A larger change in the opening mode stress intensity factor can be seen by varying the crack separation distance. As well as seeing a steady reduction in shear mode stress intensity factors as the crack separation was increased. The results showed that after a certain crack separation distance the two cracks could be analyzed separately without introducing significant error into the stress field calculations...|$|R
