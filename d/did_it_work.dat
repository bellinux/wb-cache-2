60|$|Mr. Max Mullet, {{looking on}} {{religion}} as {{the development of}} the sentiment of the Infinite, regards fetishism as a secondary and comparatively late form of belief. We find it, he observes, in various forms of Christianity; Christianity, therefore, is primary there, relic worship is secondary. Religion beginning, according to him, {{in the sense of the}} infinite, as awakened in man by tall trees, high hills, and so on, it advances to the infinite of space and sky, and so to the infinitely divine. This is primary: fetishism is secondary. Arguing elsewhere against this idea, I have asked: What was the modus of degeneration which produced similar results in Christianity, and in African and other religions?

[...] The relationship suffered a dip in 1520 when Sebastiano asked Michelangelo to write to Cardinal Bibbiena, a close friend of Pope Leo X, recommending Sebastiano for projects in the Vatican after Raphael's death.

The only orange juice you could get back then was either squeezed from fresh oranges, mixed from a relatively tasteless concentrate, or poured from a can-and it tasted like a can! All this {{at a time when}} lots of good Florida oranges were going to waste. 60 years ago, Louis G. MacDowell, director of research for the Florida Citrus Commission, had an idea. He suggested that adding a little single-strength fresh juice, or [...] "cut-back," [...] to slightly overconcentrated orange juice might restore the flavor and aroma lost during vacuum evaporation. He took the idea to USDA researchers, the folks with the equipment and expertise to help develop the idea.

5000|$|Critical {{response}} to the work has been mixed. Reviewing the premiere, Tim Ashley of The Guardian regarded the piece as [...] "lushly scored" [...] and [...] "attractively played," [...] but nevertheless opined that the work [...] "outstayed its welcome." [...] Richard Fairman of Financial Times similarly wrote, [...] "The music laps back and forth languidly, washing over the somnolent listener. Almost nothing happens, as if some crucial visual element is missing." [...] Glyn Môn Hughes of The Arts Desk further commented: [...] Pas de Deux required a big orchestra - two pianos, two harps and no fewer than seven horns. But <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>work?</b> It certainly had its attractions, mainly as a rhapsody reminiscent of Vaughan Williams, Holst or early Britten. Its opening was hypnotic, mesmerising almost, until a great crash moved the work into new, livelier territory. The soloists were intertwined with the orchestra {{and there were no}} showy cadenzas or passages of musical bravado. What the work failed to do was develop. There was precious little modulation and the same formulas were worked to death. Over a nearly half-hour span, that was hard going. But the audience loved it, many giving the piece a standing ovation. It looks like there’s every chance it could be programmed again, which is not something that always happens to every new piece which gets an airing. However, the piece was more favorable reviewed by Christian Clemmensen of the website Filmtracks.com, who wrote, [...] "The overall highlight of the concerto for Horner's enthusiasts will be the final five minutes, during which he kicks the piece into high gear for a percussively rhythmic extension of his more engaging music for films. Not surprisingly, this is where Horner's rambling chord shifts and percussive tapping dating from Sneakers to A Beautiful Mind are referenced, with the violin in a particularly powerful position to express the key shifts." [...] He added, [...] "Even for collectors of Horner's music, long parts of the concerto will languish in pensive understatement despite their lovely recording, and with the lack of definitive 'themes,' the lively third part {{may not be enough to}} save the whole for some. Those five minutes will merit a purchase of the whole for most listeners, however, the spirited send-off a fitting conclusive statement to Horner's career." ...|$|E

5000|$|Robert H. Jackson {{states that}} “(s)ince World War II a new {{approach}} to the study of public administration (...) developed.” Comparative strategies of research were developed and this meant that “administrative behavior and practices (were) analyzed in widely different societies and cultures.” [...] Alfred Diamant, a key member of the Comparative Administration Group (CAG), was part of this innovation of the discipline. “Among scholars who have contribute to the comparative studies of comparative bureaucratic systems (..., [...] ) Monroe Berger, Alfred Diamant, Ferrel Heady, Robert Presthus and Michael Crozier” are singled out as particularly noteworthy by Pardeep Sahni and Etakula Vayunandan. Diamant’s grasp of European political cultures and his knowledge of American paradigms made a comparative orientation plausible. Dwight Waldo called his discussion of “The Relevance of Comparative Politics to the Study of Comparative Administration” an excellent methodological contribution. Empirical comparative studies are a thorough approach if one wants to understand the specific traits of Fascist or Stalinist bureaucracy. [...] They could also serve to elucidate the positive and negative traits of French public administration, as a state bureaucracy subjected to dual political control. [...] How <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>work,</b> in comparison to U.S. public administration? The focus on France mattered, for another reason, as well. France was practically a sister republic of the U.S., with a long republican and progressive tradition. It was another “common law country.” In his critique of Austrian conservatism, Diamant had “defined … European political Catholicism as a reaction of both clerics and laymen to the challenges of the French Revolution respectively the modern (liberal) state of the 19th century that was based on it. This ‘anti-modernist’ attitude manifests itself on different levels - on the level of ideas, by way of the formation of a distinct ‘Catholic philosophy’ and ‘culture,’ on the socio-economic level by way of the development of a ‘Catholic social doctrine,’ on the political level by way of the organization of Catholic movements and parties.” This is how G. Stimmer sums it up. [...] France was in many ways an antipode of Austria. It was more modern, having {{been at the forefront of}} the industrial revolution, on the European continent, together with Belgium. Although Catholic, it was anti-clerical. Conservative forces were not almost constantly overwhelming Republicans. On top of it, it had a long administrative tradition anchored in Republicanism, though older roots of its ‘droit administratif’ (or legal framework pertaining to public administration), in the Royal Council of the ancien régime, existed. Diamant was especially interest in French developments that took place in the course of the first term of President Mitterrand. [...] It is noteworthy, however, that Diamant did not idealize the situation in France. It is true that it was more liberal than Austria had been. It had a strong administrative tradition, and the French republic regulated the civil service by way of a body of laws pertaining to the country’s administration. If we would suppose, however, that in France, administrators can provide some “impetus for major reform,” we are mistaken, as Aberbach et al. have not failed to point out. [...] They quote Diamant who stated flatly, “The French experience would indicate that, in fact, during periods of political indecision, the grand corps do not really govern the country, they simply continue routine operations, maintain the status quo, and protect their own interest.” Diamant obviously regrets that these administrators “could not carry through radical innovations.” [...] Civil servants of the people should after all act efficiently and determinedly, in the interest of the people.|$|E

Simulation-based {{research needs to be}} grounded in conceptual frameworks that link individual studies in a meaningful way 2 (and use educational theory in study design. Cook et al. 3 called for medical education to make greater use of theory and conceptual frameworks in producing research that asks “How and why does it work?” They proposed a framework to classify the purpose of medical education research and applied it to studies published in leading educational journals.
