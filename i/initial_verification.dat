40|$|AbstractPiezo-ceramic {{elements}} are customized as transducers for {{the measurement of}} mechanical properties of materials in the engineering field. This was made possible with the industrial production of piezo-ceramic elements in various shapes and sizes. This paper describes {{the development of a}} single flat disk shaped piezo-ceramic transducer for measuring both compression and shear wave on an identical soil specimen. Procedures for interpreting results, <b>initial</b> <b>verifications</b> of its performance and applications are also presented. Two types of piezo-ceramic elements, one for measuring P waves and the other for S waves, were placed together in a metal housing, which worked as a wave measuring transducer installed in a triaxial apparatus. Three kinds of granular geo-materials, fine, medium-coarse and coarse sands, were tested. Small strain shear stiffness, Gmax, of the tested sands was evaluated by various techniques, including proposed disk transducer method, trigger and accelerometer method and traxial small strain cyclic loading. Shear moduli obtained from all the techniques fell in a similar range within allowable scatters and it was confirmed that the disk transducer was one of applicable wave measurement technique for laboratory soil specimens...|$|R
5000|$|The {{customer}} agency {{agrees to}} various other obligations around {{the use of}} stages of verification. For instance, if the <b>initial</b> <b>verification</b> turns up no response, or if the information is inconsistent with what the applicant submitted, the agency must inform the applicant, and, if the applicant wishes to undergo additional verification, the agency must request additional verification.|$|E

50|$|In addition, {{there is}} also an option of pure paper-based verification, where the agency {{directly}} submits a paper Form G-845, and gets a response within 10 to 20 federal government work days. This costs the customer agency $2, compared to the total maximum charge of $1.50 if initiating the query electronically. However, this option is discouraged since the use of electronic means for <b>Initial</b> <b>Verification</b> saves time and money for all parties involved.|$|E

Billing is monthly, {{and there is a}} minimum monthly service transaction charge of $25.00 if the SAVE program is used at all, any time within the month. There is no charge during months when SAVE is not used at all. This pricing structure for SAVE has been effective since October 1, 2008.

50|$|In {{contrast}} to traditional mutation testing where mutant faults are generated and {{injected into the}} code description of the model, application {{of a series of}} newly defined mutation operators directly to the model properties rather than to the model code has also been investigated. Mutant properties that are generated from the initial properties (or test cases) and validated by the model checker should be considered as new properties that have been missed during the <b>initial</b> <b>verification</b> procedure. Therefore, adding these newly identified properties to the existing list of properties improves the coverage metric of the formal verification and consequently lead to a more reliable design.|$|E
50|$|The {{general way}} SAVE is used is as follows. The noncitizen first submits all the {{necessary}} documentation based on the eligibility criteria for the program {{he or she is}} applying to (these eligibility criteria can vary based on the person's immigration status, the state, and the program being applied to). If this documentation in principle demonstrates the applicant's eligibility, then the caseworker at the agency can use SAVE to verify that the documentation is accurate. If <b>Initial</b> <b>Verification</b> fails, then the caseworker can (and must, if the applicant wants) submit the case for Additional Verification and then, if necessary, submit Form G-845. If the verification fails to demonstrate the validity of the documentation provided by the applicant, the applicant is not granted the benefit. The caseworker cannot use this failure to conclude that the applicant is lying about his/her status, or to use it to report the applicant to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.|$|E

5000|$|This {{policy is}} {{being carried out}} by {{allowing}} United States citizens, aliens with correct verification, {{and those who are}} undocumented to enter into a North Carolina Community college. What is not allowed is for those students considered to be “out-of-state” entering the community colleges to receive in-state benefits, but how do we know who is in-state and out-of-state without the student lying about where they live? The NCCCS has left this up to each individual fifty-eight institutions to verify the information submitted by each student to distinguish who is in-state and who is out-of-state. The Department of Homeland Security has incorporated their own federal immigration status standards and has let each state know that they must use these standards to identify illegal alien applicants. There are three different ways to verify illegal aliens. These ways are self-certification, local review, and database verification. Self-certification involves “a process where a student is responsible for self-reporting his or her residency and/or citizenship status on an application or other required forms”. The admissions office can either trust the student on what they say or they can ask them for more documentation. This is the least recommended verification process, but it is also the cheapest. When the admissions office asks for more documents to verify residency, this is called Local Review. The local review verification method is “a process by which the student submits documentation to support residency and/or citizenship claims”. Documents that can be submitted can either be a birth certificate from any one of the fifty states or one that proves you are an American citizen but you were born out of the country or a passport or Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) documentation. [...] The last method to use is the Database Verification method. This method costs more to use because you are not just paying for those working in the admissions office, but you are also paying to use the Systematic Alien Verification of Entitlements (SAVE) program as discussed earlier. This is a “process used to verify the legal status of non-citizens, where students submit the requested information and colleges use a two-stage national system to determine the legality of a student’s non-citizen status”. The SAVE program costs the individual school using the program twenty-five dollars a month for the service plus up to a dollar maximum per student being verified. When a school is verifying a student using the SAVE system, the <b>initial</b> <b>verification</b> costs fifty cents. If the school needs to complete an additional verification, it will cost an extra fifty cents, but any additional verification after the second is free.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we aimed to {{discover}} cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins with significant abundance difference between early multiple sclerosis patients and controls, and do an <b>initial</b> <b>verification</b> of these proteins using selected reaction monitoring (SRM). iTRAQ and Orbitrap MS {{were used to}} compare the CSF proteome of patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) (n = 5), patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis that had CIS at the time of lumbar puncture (n = 5), and controls with other inflammatory neurological disease (n = 5). Of more than 1200 identified proteins, five proteins were identified with significant abundance difference between the patients and controls. In the <b>initial</b> <b>verification</b> using SRM we analyzed a larger patient and control cohort (n = 132) and also included proteins reported as differentially abundant in multiple sclerosis in the literature.

30|$|The {{recently}} revived {{interest in}} Hall current {{effects on the}} transition of ULF waves from the magnetosphere through to the ground have been investigated using one-dimensional model approximations. Both simplified analytic approximations and more realistic numerical calculations have revealed the basic effects of the inductive process involved with the Hall conductance. <b>Initial</b> experimental <b>verification</b> in the Pc 3 band has shown the expected amplitude change with ionospheric conductance (e.g. Obana et al., 2005). However, higher dimensional models are required to more realistically simulate spatial structures that are inconsistent with the assumed eik∙r spatial variations used in 1 -D models. An important example is the spatial structure of ULF wave fields across a field line resonance, which also involves a varying mix of fast and shear Alfvén modes and this case is discussed below.|$|R
