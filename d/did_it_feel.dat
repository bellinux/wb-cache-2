6000|$|He still {{resisted}} her, but {{her hand}} felt very warm and comforting--it {{was such a}} large, warm, protecting hand. So pleasant <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> that after a little while he began to move his hand up her beautiful, soft, white arm until it touched her hair. For her hair was unbound and loose; it was dark, and finer than the finest spun silk, and fell all over her shoulders and down {{her back to the}} stone she sat on. He let his fingers stray in and out among it; and it felt like the soft, warm down that lines a little bird's nest to his skin. Finally, he touched her neck and allowed his hand to rest there, it was such a soft, warm neck. At length, but reluctantly, for his little rebellious heart was not yet wholly subdued, he raised his eyes to her face. Oh, how beautiful she was! Her love and eager desire to win him had flushed her clear olive skin with rich red colour; out of her sweet red lips, half parted, came her warm breath on his cheek, more fragrant than wild flowers; and her large dark eyes were gazing down into his with such a tenderness in them that Martin, seeing it, felt a strange little shudder pass through him, and scarcely knew whether to think it pleasant or painful. [...] "Dear child, I love you so much," [...] she spoke, [...] "will you not call me mother?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{remainder}} of Tom's speech {{was cut short}} by one of those unforeseen operations {{of the laws of}} nature which are peculiar to arctic climates. During the long winter repeated falls of snow cover the housetops with white mantles upwards of a foot thick, which become gradually thicker and more consolidated as winter advances. In spring the suddenness of the thaw loosens these from the sloping roofs, and precipitates them in masses to the ground. These miniature avalanches are dangerous, people having been seriously injured and sometimes killed by them. Now it happened that a very large mass of snow, which lay on and partly depended from the roof of the house near to which the horses were standing, gave way, and just at that critical point in Tom Whyte's speech when he [...] "'ad 'im down to the smith," [...] fell with a stunning crash on the back of Mr Kennedy's gray mare. The mare was not [...] "skittish"--by no means--according to Tom's idea, {{but it would have been}} more than an ordinary mare to have stood the sudden descent of half a ton of snow without some symptoms of consciousness. No sooner <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> the blow than it sent both heels with a bang against the wooden store, by way of preliminary movement, and then rearing up with a wild snort, it sprang over Tom Whyte's head, jerked the reins from his hand, and upset him in the snow. Poor Tom never bent to anything. The military despotism under which he had been reared having substituted a touch of the cap for a bow, rendered it unnecessary to bend; prolonged drill, laziness, and rheumatism made it at last impossible. When he stood up, he did so after the manner of a pillar; when he sat down, he broke across at two points, much in the way in which a foot-rule would have done had it felt disposed to sit down; and when he fell, he came down like an overturned lamp-post. On the present occasion Tom became horizontal in a moment, and from his unfortunate propensity to fall straight, his head, reaching much farther than might have been expected, came into violent contact with the small Indian boy, who fell flat likewise, letting go the reins of the horses, which latter no sooner felt themselves free than they fled, curvetting and snorting round the court, with reins and manes flying in rare confusion.|$|E

40|$|The recent ‘budget’ {{announcement}} that all schools in England should become academies by 2022 has sparked {{a flurry of}} public concern. Academies have been called “unpopular”, are said to lack evidence of success and fall short in accountability. Multi-Academy Trusts (MATs) {{have been accused of}} steering and disproportionately benefiting from the privatization of education. For me (and many other sociologists and educational researchers) the recent announcement to roll out the academies programme was neither unexpected, nor <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> ‘new’. Here Goldsmith’s Christy Kulz pre-warned of its accelerated nature back in 2014. More importantly, our research shows how the academy reforms have already been experienced at force and for a good number of years by some of the most disadvantaged communities in England. My home town is one of these, here’s our story...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} answer a disarmingly simple question: what <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> like to use an Etruscan pot? It does so through the {{development}} of a new methodology for ceramic analysis, created from a practical application of phenomenological thought to the Etruscan archaeological record. The Etruscan world of the Archaic period, approximately 650 to 450 BCE, would have been filled with images, colours, and sensations, fragments of all of which remain wrapped up in the pottery which was deposited in tombs and on domestic sites throughout the period. By analysing the experience of using such vessels, the thesis goes on to develop new interpretations of the role of pots and their contents in Etruscan society, particularly the Etruscan use of alcohol and the structure of formal feasting events. The presence of new pottery forms, with novel imagery imported from the Greek Eastern Mediterranean, provides a comparison which drives the analysis. By re-conceptualising these iconic imports as foci for Etruscan experiences, the relationship between these predominantly Attic ceramics and their Etruscan users is recast to emphasise the contrasts in ceramic usage brought in by these new vessels, and the shifts in behaviour, belief and banqueting that potentially accompanied them...|$|E
