40|$|As the {{tremendous}} growth in peer-to-peer (P 2 P) applications, the {{issues related to}} file consistency become critical. In this paper, an algorithm for <b>file</b> Consistency <b>Maintenance</b> through Virtual servers (CMV) is proposed for unstructured and decentralized P 2 P systems. In CMV, consistency of each dynamic file is maintained by a virtual server (VS). A file update can only be accepted through the VS to ensure the one-copy serializability. The VS of a file is a logical network composed of multiple replica peers (RPs) that have replicas of the file. Mathematical analysis is performed to determine the optimal parameter selections that achieve minimum overhead messages for maintaining file consistency. The numerical results indicate that CMV is well suited for efficient <b>file</b> consistency <b>maintenance</b> in P 2 P systems. Department of ComputingRefereed conference pape...|$|R

40|$|As {{more and}} more {{applications}} with dynamic files are introduced in peer-to-peer (P 2 P) systems, <b>file</b> consistency <b>maintenance</b> becomes important. In this paper, we propose a novel <b>file</b> consistency <b>maintenance</b> algorithm, called Update P ropagation T hrough Replica Chain (UPTReC), for decentralized and unstructured peer-to-peer (P 2 P) systems. UPTReC provides a probabilistically guaranteed file consistency. In UPTReC, each file has a logical replica chain composed of all replica peers (RPs) which {{is defined as a}} peer that has a replica of the file. Each RP acquires partial knowledge of the bi-directional chain by keeping a list of information about k nearest RPs in each direction. When an RP initiates an update, it pushes the update to all possible online (active) RPs through the replica chain. A reconnected RP pulls an online RP to synchronize the replica status and the chain information. An analytical model is derived to evaluate the performance of the UPTReC algorithm. The analytical results provide insights of the system design in choosing the parameters. Simulation experiments are conducted to compare the performance with an existing update propagation algorithm based on the rumor spreading scheme. The experimental results show that UPTReC can significantly reduce (up to 70 %) overhead messages and also achieve smaller stale query ratio for files prone to frequent updates...|$|R

Organizations that manage records casually find it difficult to access and retrieve information when needed. The inefficiency of filing maintenance and storage systems can prove to be costly in terms of wasted space and resources expended searching for records.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{methodology}} for analyzing {{the performance and}} stability of a server that maintains a multilevel data structure to service a set of access operations for (key, value) records.
