500|$|When {{designing}} Ares, Charlie Wen {{was advised}} {{that the character}} should be 90% elemental and 5–10% human, then began sketching. He said {{that the rest of}} the team liked the designs, but were uncertain about execution. The transition towards Ares' human form was slow, and Wen said of the final design, [...] "he's still a huge guy, but he's got all this armor on that allows him to do all these things." [...] Like most of the Olympian gods in God of War, Zeus first appeared as a floating translucent head, and was modeled on the typical representation of the god in Greek mythology. Cory Barlog (Game Director of God of War II) said that for God of War II, they wanted to maintain Zeus' appearance from literature, but also to add their own interpretation to the character. Zeus' human appearance was originally designed by Charlie Wen for God of War II. This design was also used in God of War III, with updated graphics and the addition of an arm piece during the final fight. Andy Park was responsible for designing Zeus' spirit form for the final fight. Park produced several sketches, and imagined Zeus as a [...] "massive tornado creature with lightning searing throughout the form." [...] Park said that the ultimate goal was that [...] "we are looking at Zeus, but it <b>is</b> <b>him</b> transformed into a big cloud of smoke." ...|$|E
