2500|$|The current {{standard}} composition for {{the black}} powders that are manufactured by pyrotechnicians was adopted {{as long ago as}} 1780. Proportions by weight are 75% potassium nitrate (known as saltpeter or saltpetre), 15% softwood charcoal, and 10% sulfur. These ratios have varied over the centuries and by country, and can be altered somewhat depending on the purpose of the powder. For instance, power grades of black powder, unsuitable for use in firearms but adequate for blasting rock in quarrying operations, are called blasting powder rather than gunpowder with standard proportions of 70% nitrate, 14% charcoal, and 16% sulfur; blasting powder may be made with the cheaper sodium nitrate substituted for potassium nitrate and proportions may be as low as 40% nitrate, 30% charcoal, and 30% sulfur.

In addition, lower explosion concentrations and explosibility of these dusts were evaluated. It was shown that <b>graphite</b> <b>dusts</b> with particles sizes from 4 to 40 #mu#m were able to explode {{in a wide range of}} concentrations.

Beginning with a literature review of work on dust in Tokamaks, and the basic theory of dust-plasma interaction, we discuss the need for such a model. The theory of dust grain charging in a plasma is then reviewed. In Tokamak plasmas, significant secondary and thermionic electron emis-sion can be caused, charging the grain positive. A theory describing this based on the orbit motion limited (OML) model is developed. Following this we develop a dust grain heating model, and predict steady state temperatures and survival times for <b>graphite</b> and tungsten <b>dust</b> in plasmas of different temperatures and densities.

5000|$|The overly complex {{design of}} the reactor, which is {{contrary}} to the general concept of self moderated thorium reactors designed in the U.S., also suffered from the unplanned high destruction rate of pebbles during the test series at the start up, and the resulting higher contamination of the containment structure. Pebble debris and <b>graphite</b> <b>dust</b> blocked some of the coolant channels in the bottom reflector, as was discovered during fuel removal some years after final shut-down. A failure of insulation required frequent reactor shut-downs for inspection, because the insulation could not be repaired. Further metallic components in the hot gas duct failed in September 1988, probably due to thermal fatigue induced by unexpected hot gas currents. This failure led to a long-term shut-down for inspections. In August, 1989, the THTR company almost went bankrupt, but was financially rescued by the government. Because of the unexpected high costs of THTR operation, and this accident, there was no longer any interest in THTR reactors. The government decided to terminate the THTR operation at the end of September, 1989. This particular reactor was built, despite strong criticism at the design phase. Most of those design critique's by German physicists, and by American physicists at the National Laboratory level, went ignored until it was shut down.

The hardness, compressive strength, density, flame resistance, wear rate and porosity of the products were then determined. The result obtained showed that the brake pad produced with the corn husk passing the finer 100 μm screen gave better compressive strength, higher hardness, lower porosity and lower rate of wear, consequent on the finer distribution of the corn husks particles in the matrix. The results obtained for the brake pads were then compared with that of commercial brake pad (asbestos based and optimum formulation laboratory brake pad, corn husk based).

40|$|Eta Carinae shows broad {{peaks in}} {{near-infrared}} (IR) JHKL photometry, roughly correlated with times of periastron {{passage in the}} eccentric binary system. After correcting for secular changes attributed to reduced extinction from the thinning Homunculus Nebula, these peaks have IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) consistent with emission from hot dust at 1400 - 1700 K. The excess SEDs are clearly inconsistent, however, with the excess being entirely due to free-free wind or photospheric emission. One must conclude, therefore, that the broad near-IR peaks associated with Eta Carinae's 5. 5 yr variability are due to thermal emission from hot dust. I propose that this transient hot dust results from episodic formation of grains within compressed post-shock zones of the colliding winds, analogous to the episodic dust formation in Wolf-Rayet binary systems like WR 140 or the post-shock dust formation seen in some supernovae like SN 2006 jc. This dust formation in Eta Carinae seems to occur preferentially near and after periastron passage; near-IR excess emission then fades as the new dust disperses and cools. With the high grain temperatures and Eta Car's C-poor abundances, the grains are probably composed of corundum or similar species that condense at high temperatures, rather than silicates or <b>graphite.</b> Episodic <b>dust</b> formation in Eta Car's colliding winds significantly impacts {{our understanding of the}} system, and several observable consequences are discussed.

To better understand this abrasion and particle generation, I have completed two independent tests using a custom in-house, designed and built, testing system. One test of sliding abrasion and one test of spinning abrasion was conducted, both in a low relative humidity air environment. I have used both a commercial non-nuclear grade graphite denoted, GM- 101, and a nuclear grade, MLRF 1, from SGL Carbon for these tests. For spinning abrasion, GM- 101 and MLRF 1 were used. For sliding abrasion, only GM- 101 was used. I have obtained size distributions for the abraded particles, fit lognormal functions to those size distributions (for use in computer codes), determined particle shapes, measured temperature and humidity during the tests, measured surface temperatures at the contact point of the samples, calculated wear rates, measured the surface roughness of both pre-test and post-test samples, measured particle surface areas, measured pore volumes, and pore volume distributions of particles produced during abrasion of graphite surfaces under different loadings and sliding speeds, or rotational speeds, for both experiments. The experiments showed that as loading (analogous to pebble depth in the reactor) and rotation speeds or sliding speeds increase, so do wear rates, concentration of particles and particle surface area. The shape of the dust particles was in every case non-spherical.

First, we show that the Milky-Way extinction curve is reproduced by introducing a moderate fraction (~ 0. 2) of dense molecular-cloud phases in the interstellar medium for a graphite-silicate dust model. Then we show that the peculier extinction curves in high-z quasars {{can be explained by}} taking a much higher molecular-cloud fraction (> 0. 5), which leads to more efficient grain growth and coagulation, and by assuming amorphous carbon instead of <b>graphite.</b> The large <b>dust</b> content in high-z quasar hosts is also found to be a natural consequence of the enhanced dust growth. These results indicate that grain growth and coagulation in molecular clouds are key processes that can increase the dust mass and change the size distribution of dust in galaxies, and that, along with a different dust composition, can contribute to shape the extinction curve.
