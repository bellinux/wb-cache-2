40|$|The mass {{transfer}} problem in liquid flows through channels and hollows of various shapes is encountered in many {{processes of the}} chemical and food industries where multiphase liquids move. In the food industry, these processes are exemplified by milk skimming in cream separators, milk refinement from the finest solid particles in refiners, separation of livestock blood obtained during slaughter into erythrocytes and plasma in separators, and blending of food (milk, ground meat, soft cheeses, and the like) with various additives that consist of the finest solid or liquid particles. In the chemical industry, examples are flows of dissolved macromolecules, wood pulps (in paper manufacturing), latex particles suspended in <b>emulsion</b> <b>dyes,</b> reinforcing particles in polymer melts, and the like. Here, we consider the mass-transfer problem as applied to the dispersion, in a given volume, of some portion of a liquid medium (hereafter, a liquid) that contains a weight or volume concentration...|$|R
40|$|A {{transmission}} densitometer utilizing {{fiber optics}} for the efflux geometry was designed, constructed, and tested with several {{black and white}} films, and one color film. The system was semi-specularly illuminated and used semi-specular collection. The system demonstrates the feasibility of using fiber optic bundles in sensitometric equipment. Scattering properties of silver <b>emulsions,</b> color <b>dye</b> infra-red radiation transmission, and assorted electronic factors which introduce error in densitometric values are observed and discussed...|$|R
50|$|Chromogenic film {{or paper}} {{contains}} one or {{many layers of}} silver halide (AgX) <b>emulsion,</b> along with <b>dye</b> couplers that, in combination with processing chemistry, form visible dyes. In processing, the silver image of each layer is first developed. In concert with the dye couplers in each layer, the process subsequently forms dyes only in those areas where silver is present.|$|R
50|$|Color film is {{much more}} complex due to {{multiple}} layers of <b>emulsion</b> and <b>dye.</b> The negative consists of three emulsion layers sensitive to the primary colors (red, green, and blue) each {{with a layer of}} developing dye beneath it of the complementary color (cyan, magenta, and yellow). Once light exposed the negative, the reagent is spread between the negative and positive and the developing dye layer migrates to the positive surface where it forms the photo. Emulsion layers exposed to their respective color block the complementary dye below it, reproducing the original color. For example, a photo of a blue sky would expose the blue emulsion, blocking all the yellow dye beneath it and allowing the magenta and cyan dye layers to migrate to the positive to form blue.|$|R
40|$|Prints made {{on paper}} {{currently}} available will fade, and badly, over a relatively few years. Not so with color prints made on Konica SR Paper. The rich color and details in these pictures will show virtually {{no signs of}} fading in 100 years. Our advanced <b>emulsion</b> technology enhances <b>dye</b> stability. In fact, accelerated aging tests show that dye images will retain more than 70 % of their original density for 100 years or longer under normal album storage conditions. ...|$|R
50|$|Kodachrome {{films are}} non-{{substantive}}. Unlike substantive transparency and negative color films, Kodachrome films did not incorporate dye couplers into the <b>emulsion</b> layers. The <b>dye</b> couplers were added during processing. This means that Kodachrome emulsion layers are thinner and less light is scattered upon exposure, {{meaning that the}} film could record an image with more sharpness than substantive films. Transparencies made with non-substantive films have an easily visible relief image on the emulsion side of the film. Kodachrome films have a dynamic range of around 12 stops, or 3.6-3.8D.|$|R
5000|$|The {{director}} D.W. Griffith {{displayed a}} constant interest and concern about color, and used tinting to a unique effect {{in many of}} his films. His 1915 epic, The Birth of a Nation, utilized a number of colors, including amber, blue, lavender, and a striking red tint for scenes such as the [...] "burning of Atlanta" [...] and the ride of the Ku Klux Klan at {{the climax of the}} picture. Griffith later invented a color system in which colored lights flashed on areas of the screen to achieve a color effect.In 1921, Kodak introduced pre-tinted stocks, with stained cellulose base, rather than a <b>dyed</b> <b>emulsion</b> upon the base. The colors available originally were lavender, red, green, blue, pink, light amber, dark amber, yellow, and orange.|$|R
40|$|A {{waterborne}} polyurethane-based polymeric dye (WPU-CFBB) was synthesized by anchoring 1, 4 -bis(methylamino) anthraquinone (CFBB) to waterborne polyurethane chains. The number molecular weight, {{glass transition}} temperature, and average emulsion particle size for the polymeric dye were determined, respectively. This polymeric dye exhibited intriguing optical behaviors. The polymeric dye engendered two new absorption bands centered at about 520 [*]nm and 760 [*]nm {{if compared with}} CFBB in UV-vis spectra. The 760 [*]nm peak showed hypsochromic shift with the decrease of average particle sizes. The polymeric dye dramatically demonstrated both hypsochromic and bathochromic effects with increasing temperature. The fluorescence intensity of the polymeric dye was much {{higher than that of}} CFBB. It was found that the fluorescence intensities would be enhanced from 20 °C to 40 °C and then decline from 40 °C to 90 °C. The fluorescence of the polymeric <b>dye</b> <b>emulsion</b> was very stable and was not sensitive to quenchers...|$|R
40|$|The study {{describes}} {{the effect of}} span 80 -tween 80 surfactant mixtures on {{the stability of the}} sunflower oil based emulsions. The emulsification was carried out in various proportions of span 80 -tween 80 mixtures so as to have a HLB range varying from 6. 4 to 13. 8. Attempts were made to prepare both W/O and O/W emulsions by using oil: water fractions at 4 : 1 and 1 : 4 ratios, respectively. The emulsions which were stable for 24 h, were further observed for 56 h to have an insight on their long-term stability. The emulsions which showed signs of destabilization, during the period of 24 h to 56 h, were analyzed microscopically and measuring pH to understand the mechanism of destabilization. The stable samples were thoroughly characterized by light microscopy, pH measurement and accelerated stability test by thermocycling method. The micrographs of the samples were analyzed using Image J and Vision Assistant softwares. All samples stable up to 24 h were found to be W/O <b>emulsions</b> by <b>dye</b> solubility test. The unstable and short-term stable samples indicated cracking and creaming/sedimentation, respectively, as the destabilization phenomena. The pH of the short-term stable samples decreased with time whereas the pH of the long-term stable samples was almost constant throughout the 56 h time period. The long-term stable emulsions did not show any change in the particle size along the time scale...|$|R
50|$|The {{finished}} {{film was}} assembled and printed by Technicolor in California, {{using the same}} system that had produced all the great Hollywood color films from the 1930s through the 1960s. The process was called imbibition, in which black and white fine-grain masters were created {{for each of the}} colors, run through a bath of ink, and contact printed onto clear acetate, one after the other, just as books would have been printed. It was quite a bit more expensive than using light-sensitive film which would then be chemically developed, but the clarity and control was more exact and of better quality than light-sensitive stock. By the time when Moonwalk One was finished, light-sensitive emulsion film had become much better technically and was much cheaper than the Technicolor imbibition process. Moonwalk One {{was one of the last}} films created using that process, which was shut down forever shortly thereafter. The fact that Moonwalk One was printed with inks instead of with unstable <b>dye</b> <b>emulsions</b> probably accounts for its remarkable condition after 40 years.|$|R
40|$|In three color {{photographic}} processes the cyan dye {{image is}} usually {{controlled by the}} red sensitive <b>emulsion,</b> the magenta <b>dye</b> image by the green sensitive layer, and the yellow dye image by the blue sensitive layer. Due to the proximity of these three layers in a color film interactions among the images are found to occur. It {{has been found that}} when the images are combined into a three color picture {{they do not have the}} same characteristics as they would have if they occurred separately. The density produced in each layer depends not only on the amount of exposure of that layer but also on the amount of exposure in the other layers. The amount of dye image produced in one layer is therefore influenced by the presence or absence of simultaneous development in the other layer. The specific nature of these interactions is an important characteristic of any given color photographic process and are known as interimage effects. These interactions may be studied by means of sensitometric exposures. Interimage effects have been found in both Kodak Ektachrome Film 5258 (Tungsten) and GAF 2500 (Daylight). Data was obtained by exposing each film to produce single layer exposures and an additive neutral. Plotting the characteristic curves from the data revealed an interaction taking place in each film. Due to the inability to determine the equivalent neutral densities this report can only justifiably say that an interaction is present in both films. For a more, definitive statement on the interimage effects present in each film one must determine the equivalent neutral densities...|$|R
40|$|Batik is an {{integral}} heritage of the Indonesian culture. With a variety of beauty, style and quality, natural colors and patterns of interest makes batik a very popular traditional cloth. Indonesia {{as one of the}} tropical country has great potential to produce healthy batik and friendly to the environment by utilizing various resources that available in nature. Efforts to produce environmentally-friendly batik can be done using colors derived from extracts of plant that contain flavonoide with attractive colors. Natural dyes for textile materials are generally obtained from the extracts of various parts of plant one of its is wood. Formulation of colouring material in an emulsion system that is ready to use is an attractive approach to encourage the use of natural colourant. In this research, colouring material was extracted using an organic solvent and emulsified in water {{with the aid of a}} surfactant. This research aimed to identify the characteristics of emulsion of tegeran wood extract. The concentration of mixture of tegeran wood extract and surfactant was varied (5, 10, 15 and 20 % and the characterization included microscopic structures, colour intensity and viscosity. The research showed that viscosity increased with the increase in concentration of tegeran wood extract (ranged from 17, 33 â 28, 67 cp). Tegeran <b>dyes</b> <b>emulsion</b> with 3 % tawas addition, analysis its size used to particle size analyzer for 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 % concentration resulted 1, 55, 2, 2, 2, 05, 2, 6, 2, 4 and 2, 65 nano meter.

40|$|Today many potent anticancer {{drugs like}} {{cisplatin}} are available which carry {{a number of}} side effects. A promising way of reducing the side effects is to target the drug to tissue sites by coating it with biocompatible materials like Poly (dl-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) polymer where controlled drug release is achieved during the biodegradation of the polymer. Also the efficacy of anticancer drugs like cisplatin increases at elevated temperatures, so if local heating can be achieved where the drug is targeted. Local heating {{can be achieved by}} introducing iron core nanoparticles in the composites along with the drug, which can be heated by the 2. 4 GHz microwaves. Local heating of the nanocomposites also helps to swell the polymer shell and enhance the drug release. The magnetic nanocomposites were synthesized using ironnanoparticles, PLGA and a fluorescent dye, tris-(2, 2 ′bipyridyl) dichlororuthenium (II) using an oil-in-emulsion technique. The <b>emulsion</b> contains PLGA, <b>dye,</b> and ironnanoparticles dissolved in the oil phase and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as a stabilizer. As the sample is homogenized, and dried, uniform 100 nm composites are formed where the dye and ironnanoparticles are encapsulated in a PLGA shell. Control of the thickness and loading efficiency of the nanocomposite can be controlled by varying the ratio of PLGA, iron, and dye. The amount of loading was determined using TGA confirming from 20 – 50 % (w/w) loading. As the dye is released from the composite the fluorescence intensity decreases due to self-quenching. This self-quenching allows for the determination of the release kinetics as a function of temperature using fluorescence spectroscopy. Initial results suggest that there is a release of 5 – 10 % of the dye from the composite at 25 °C and complete release after the nanocomposite reaches 90 °C. Using local microwave heating the complete release of the dye can be accomplished with three two second pulses of 2. 4 GHz microwaves. This allows for the complete drug delivery platform which allows for the controlled release using microwave frequency...|$|R
