60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around.</b> Thain {{had taken}} his place at the further end of the room.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> {{a little}} helplessly. Quest took a cigar from his case, and lit it.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> leisurely, {{and to his}} {{surprise}} {{found that more than}} the man had disappeared.|$|E
60|$|Louis {{was silent}} for a moment. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> {{carelessly}} <b>around</b> the room to assure himself that there were no listeners.|$|R
60|$|Red Gallagher {{staggered}} to his feet. Already {{the horror}} of the murderer was in his eyes as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> furtively <b>around.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I refused," [...] <b>he</b> admitted, <b>glancing</b> <b>around</b> {{to where}} the Marquis was engaged in {{conversation}} with a gardener, [...] "because I didn't want to come." ...|$|R
60|$|Tallente {{affected}} to misunderstand. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> at the few farmhouses dotted in sheltered places {{amongst the}} hills.|$|E
60|$|The Professor smiled beatifically as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around.</b> He had {{the air of}} one propounding an unanswerable problem.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> him {{and then}} {{arranged}} his necktie in the glass above the mantel with a nervous laugh.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can go up}} to my {{room and}} help me stow away some baggage," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>glancing</b> <b>around</b> as if to make certain they were not observed.|$|R
60|$|He stood quite {{still for}} a moment, listening. Then <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> sharply <b>around</b> the room. He looked at Mabane, {{and he looked at}} Arthur. Finally he {{addressed}} me.|$|R
60|$|But neither his {{previous}} curiosity nor present bravado seemed {{to impress the}} ragged stranger with much favor. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> sulkily <b>around</b> the cabin and began to shuffle towards the door.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> the room. Our hands fell apart. I lit a {{cigarette}} and looked at the open trunk.|$|E
60|$|Draconmeyer's manner {{became more}} mysterious. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> {{the room as}} though {{to be sure that}} they were not overheard.|$|E
60|$|Sabatini {{drew out}} {{a chair and}} seated himself. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> at the house and then began slowly to unbutton his white kid gloves.|$|E
60|$|Longstreth barred Lawson from entering, which action showed {{control as}} well as distrust. He wanted to see into the room. When <b>he</b> had <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>he</b> went out and closed the door.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> coolly <b>around</b> him. [...] "Whatever we've {{got to say}} to each other," [...] he said deliberately, [...] "had {{better not}} be overheard. At least what I have got to say to you." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> hurriedly <b>around,</b> took a {{key from}} his pocket, and {{unlocked}} the padlock that secured the closet she had noticed. Then, reaching within, with infinite care {{he brought out}} a small mechanical model.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a moment}} or two before <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around,</b> and then Anthea met his gaze, in which, however, there was no trace of inquiry.|$|E
60|$|The natives' manner made Larry suspicious, and <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> hurriedly. As he did {{so there}} was a click of a trigger from behind the bamboo fence.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> {{the room}} {{for a moment or}} two, as though {{interested}} in the people. Satisfied at last that there was no chance of being overheard, he continued: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By {{a slight}} {{variation}} from your story," [...] he answered. [...] "In fact, words are not needed. A suggestion only would be enough, and circumstances," [...] <b>he</b> added, <b>glancing</b> <b>around,</b> [...] "are strongly {{in favour of}} that suggestion." ...|$|R
60|$|A. Jones moved uneasily in his chair. Then <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> quickly <b>around</b> {{the circle}} and found every eye {{regarding}} him with eager curiosity. He blushed again, a deep red this time, but {{an instant later}} straightened up and spoke {{in a tone of}} sudden resolve.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why strange?" [...] <b>he</b> answered, <b>glancing</b> <b>around</b> the room, and {{lowering}} his voice a little. [...] "Don't you remember at our last meeting you promised {{to bring my}} tea a few hours later? Since then, I have not even seen you, nor have you sent me a line." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{it was one}} of the stays!" [...] {{answered}} Dick. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around.</b> [...] "The right {{plane is}} giving 'way! Sam, let her down, as quick as you can!" ...|$|E
60|$|Burton {{looked at}} the man and down at his barrow. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> at the {{neighborhood}} {{in which he had}} to make a living. Then he groaned softly to himself.|$|E
60|$|At sunset {{the golden}} gloom of the glen {{changed to a}} vague, thick twilight. Anson rolled over, yawned, and sat up. As <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around,</b> evidently seeking Burt, his face clouded.|$|E
6000|$|... "This seems all right," [...] <b>he</b> admitted, <b>glancing</b> <b>around.</b> [...] "Well, {{one part}} of the great work is finished. I have lived for eleven days not quite sure when I wasn't going to be stood up with my back to the light at the Tower. Now it's over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Mr. Carvel," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>glancing</b> <b>around</b> the circle, {{political}} {{principles are}} not to be swallowed like religion, but taken rather like medicine, experimentally. If they agree with you, very good. If not, drop them and try others. We are always ready to listen to remedies, here." ...|$|R
60|$|She let him {{help her}} to her seat again as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> hurriedly <b>around</b> him. It must have been sympathy with her, for he was {{conscious}} of a slight vertigo himself. The air was very close and still. Even the pleasant murmur of the waves had ceased.|$|R
60|$|Julian {{entered the}} drawing-room hurriedly {{a few minutes}} later. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> quickly, {{conscious}} of a distinct feeling of disappointment. His mother, who was arranging a bridge table, called him over to her side.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wonder how {{the folks}} are making {{out in the}} Park," [...] came from Dave. [...] "I hope they have better {{accommodations}} than this," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> at the bare walls and bare floor.|$|E
60|$|He was {{perfectly}} collected. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> {{the room with}} a smile of quiet amusement. A certain embarrassment seized the little party, and Lady Kelsey, as she shook hands with him, was at a loss for words.|$|E
6000|$|Ashley's {{face flushed}} crimson {{at the sight}} of the stranger. [...] "Hush!" [...] he said almost involuntarily. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> rapidly <b>around</b> the group, and then in some embarrassment replied with awkward literalness, [...] "I left my horse with the others at the {{entrance}} of the ca√±on." ...|$|R
60|$|The man {{sat down}} at a side table and ordered several things. Then <b>he</b> {{happened}} to <b>glance</b> <b>around,</b> noticed the students for the first time, and scowled.|$|R
6000|$|... "All!--ah, no. There is one more, but I {{dare not}} speak it here," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>glancing</b> craftily <b>around</b> through the slowly darkening wood.|$|R
