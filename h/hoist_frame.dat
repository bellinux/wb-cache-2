40|$|Storage {{space in}} sport and {{competitive}} rowing sheds is limited. The use of racking is common to improve the utilisation of available floor space. This project aims to develop a hoisting system suitable for the vertical storage of the small boats (tinnies) that are used for coaching and other functions in the sport. A search of available boat hoists revealed numerous manufactures and designs mainly in the United States. It seems the American people use boat hoists {{in the same way}} as we use boat trailers in Australia. These existing hoist products are used for out of water storage of small boats and are usually mounted lake side or attached to a wharf structure. None of the hoists located are capable of storing more than one boat vertically. A new type of hoist will be required. Due to the time available for the design work this project has focused on researching hoist requirements and design and is restricted to the hoisting system. The hoisting system is an integral part of the overall hoist structure therefore some preliminary design work of the hoist structure has also be undertaken. Additional work to be completed before prototype fabrication is the design of the lifting arm guides and bearing assemblies and the design of the <b>hoist</b> <b>frame</b> structure. Firm commercial interest exists in this product and for other storage solutions based upon this hoist...|$|E
50|$|A 1918 {{postcard}} {{shows the}} original headframe building. The headframe was a simple, two-storey, wooden {{building with a}} shallow gable roof. From the roof projected a low, steel <b>hoisting</b> <b>frame</b> with a timber-framed cover above the sheaves, which redirected the hoisting cable from the reversible water wheel into the sloping shaft. In {{the face of the}} gable wall were openings for feeding the flatrods of the water wheel which ran down the slope. The mine railway emerged from the gateway {{at the side of the}} building.|$|R

500|$|A {{deck crane}} {{was used for}} the {{construction}} of the main span of the bridge. A specially designed crane of 45tonne capacity was used to erect the pylons of the bridge. The structural steel used in the bridge weighs about 13,200 tonnes. The pylons, which are [...] in height, are designed as free standing portals. They are provided with two cross portal members, one at the bottom and another at the top, below the pylon head. The deck is connected to the end piers by bolts embedded in the chambers of the piers. Pylons made of [...] steel boxes of riveted construction were raised on the two side spans of the bridge; one set is on the Calcutta side and the other is on the Howrah side. The six pylons on the Calcutta side of the bridge were installed using 75 MT and 50 MT cranes, while on the Howrah end, a single 50 MT crane was used. Anchorage of the pylon with the base of piers was effected through Dywidag rods, duly anchored in the piers. Cables were erected from the four pylon heads with the help of 32 MT <b>hoist</b> <b>frames.</b> The <b>hoist</b> <b>frames</b> were mounted on top of each pylon. Sheave blocks, winches and snatch blocks were used to facilitate the lifting, and cables inside the pylons were stressed with jacks. Pressure grouting was performed to fill the voids between the wire and the high-density polyethylene (HDPE) tubes. A twotonne tower crane, fixed inside the pylons, lifted the cables into position.|$|R

500|$|The shallow-draught {{requirement}} forced Barnaby {{to build}} her with twin screws, {{as a single}} screw of larger diameter would have been mounted insufficiently deep to be effective. The Admiralty also wanted hoistable propellers as the reports from [...] and , with their fixed propellers, were distinctly uncomplimentary about their sailing qualities. She was the only twin-screw ship ever to have hoisting screws. Provision for the <b>hoisting</b> <b>frames</b> and twin rudders forced a very unusual shape to the stern which unintentionally greatly increased drag. The other issue was that the shallowness of her draught made her very unhandy under sail, and she was described as [...] "drifting to leeward in a wind like a tea tray". Penelope was ship-rigged with three masts and a sail area of [...] Her speed under sail alone was only [...] Her shallow draught gave her a metacentric height of [...] at deep load which made her a very steady gun platform.|$|R

50|$|Mining {{applications}} {{often require}} high preloads, and joints encounter high dynamic forces, {{which can cause}} joints to loosen. MJTs can keep joints tight on boom points, ring gears, side <b>frames,</b> <b>hoist</b> motors, drag lines, pinion gears, split gears, and excavator bearing caps, because the joint is loaded in pure tension without twisting. Some applications, such as toothed rims, require short bolts - MJTs {{can be useful in}} these applications because they greatly improve the elasticity of the joint.|$|R
5000|$|Due to the {{availability}} of water power this system was used until {{the closure of the}} Clausthal and Lautenthal Pits in the 1930s (e.g. at the Silbersegen Shaft and the Black Pit or Schwarze Grube). steam power was first used in earnest when the stone coal necessary for its operation could be delivered by railway {{towards the end of the}} 19th century. Electricity began to be generated at about the same time using water power from the Upper Harz Water Regale - an extensive network of ponds, dams, ditches and tunnels, originally built to supply the mines with water power. In 1900 water was passed through turbines and electrical winding engines. At that time modern pits emerged with steel <b>hoist</b> <b>frames.</b> The most important innovation in the Upper Harz hauling technology was the Albert Cable (Albert-Seil). Chief Mining Engineer (Oberbergrat) Wilhelm Albert (1787-1846) made a cable out of steel wire which was first successfully tested on 23 July 1834 at the Carolina Shaft. That was the birth of the wire cable. As the distance between shaft and workings lengthened and increasing quantities of material had to be moved, wheelbarrows or small wagons (the Hunte or Hunde) were used underground as horizontal methods of transportation. Up to 1800 they ran on wooden planks with flangeless wheels and guide pins (Spurn√§geln). Thereafter iron rails took over, initially as hand-forged rails (Hammelpfote) only one metre long. Until 1900 the wagons were almost always pushed by hand. Pit ponies were not used in the Upper Harz. From 1905 at the Clausthal Ore Mine (Erzbergwerk Clausthal) underground haulage was carried out using conductor engines in the gallery known as the Tiefsten Wasserstrecke or [...] "Deepest Watercourse". In the Grund Ore Mine (Erzbergwerk Grund) battery-driven locomotives were used from the 1970s and, finally, diesel engines on wheels with rubber tyres. One feature mining in the Upper Harz was the underground transportation of material in boats on the Tiefe Wasserstrecke about 300 metres deep, in Clausthal and Zellerfeld from 1835 to 1898.|$|R
5000|$|Federation Square, a {{building}} complex in Melbourne, Australia, features the pinwheel tiling. In the project, the tiling pattern {{is used to}} create the structural sub-framing for the facades, allowing for the facades to be fabricated off-site, in a factory and later erected to form the facades. The pinwheel tiling system {{was based on the}} single triangular element, composed of zinc, perforated zinc, sandstone or glass (known as a tile), which was joined to 4 other similar tiles on an aluminum frame, to form a [...] "panel". Five panels were affixed to a galvanized steel frame, forming a [...] "mega-panel", which were then <b>hoisted</b> onto support <b>frames</b> for the facade. The rotational positioning of the tiles gives the facades a more random, uncertain compositional quality, even though the process of its construction is based on pre-fabrication and repetition. The same pinwheel tiling system is used {{in the development of the}} structural frame and glazing for the [...] "Atrium" [...] at Federation Square, although in this instance, the pin-wheel grid has been made [...] "3-dimensional" [...] to form a portal frame structure.|$|R
