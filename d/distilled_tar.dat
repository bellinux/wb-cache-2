50|$|Robert Wilson first {{produced}} {{sulphuric acid}} and fertilisers at Urlay Nook near Egglescliffe in 1833 {{and this was}} Teesside's first great chemical works. In 1859 rock salt deposits were discovered at Middlesbrough by Henry Bolckow and Vaughan while boring for water {{at a depth of}} 1,206 feet and this led to the move to Teesside of the heavy chemical industry. In 1860 William James established an alkali company at Cargo Fleet and in 1869 Samuel Sadler also set up a factory nearby. Sadler's works produced synthetic aniline and alzarine dyestuffs and <b>distilled</b> <b>tar.</b> The introduction of the Solvay Process to make alkali in 1872 made the Tyneside alkali industry uneconomic but it was a real boost to Teesside industry which was invigorated by the discovery of further salt deposits at Port Clarence near Seal Sands by Bell Brothers in 1874. The Solvay process or ammonia-soda process is still today the major industrial process for the production of sodium carbonate. The process was developed into its modern form by Ernest Solvay during the 1860s and it requires salt brine and limestone as basic raw materials. The worldwide production of soda ash in 2005 has been estimated at 42 billion kilograms. Salt manufacture for human consumption by panning had taken place at Seal Sands since Roman times and in the 20th century, extraction of salt from the salt strata below ground in the Seal Sands area, known as the Saltholme Brine Fields, has left salt caverns which are now used as liquid/gas strorage facilities for the process industry.|$|E

With {{the move to}} North Sea gas the gas works closed in 1973, leaving gas {{distribution}} and storage as the main on site functions.

Due to its historical and cultural importance, charcoal burning and <b>tar</b> <b>distilling</b> were incorporated in December 2014 into the register of the Intangible Cultural Heritage in Germany by the Kultusministerkonferenz.|$|R
50|$|Exploiting German <b>tar</b> <b>distilling</b> {{technology}} Major & Company Ltd. manufactured a {{range of}} products from tar supplied as a by-product of the town gas works. As they expanded they improved their refining to generate larger profits from higher-end products. The business grew into a nationwide operation with several depots. After Major died in 1895 his son continued manufacturing. In 1921 they joined Midland Tar Distillers and in several guises the company was still operating in 1969 when finally {{taken over by the}} Burmah Castrol Group.|$|R
40|$|Acridine was {{discovered}} by Graebe and Caro who found that it accompanied the crude anthracene obtained from coal-tar. For its isolation, {{the portion of the}} <b>tar</b> <b>distilling</b> at 300 °- 360 ° C. was extracted by dilute sulphuric acid and precipitated by potassium dichromate, the precipitate recrystallized from hot water and then decomposed by dilute ammonia. The free base was then dissolved in hot hydrochloric acid, from this solution acridine hydrochloride was thrown out by addition of an excess of concentrated hydrochloric acid. From this salt the free acridine was liberated by ammonia...|$|R

Atwood became a partner of this new company located at Waltham, Massachusetts. They manufactured products that were <b>distilled</b> from coal <b>tar.</b> Atwood invented [...] "coup oil" [...] in 1852, {{which was the first}} oil extracted from coal. [...] Atwood's [...] "coup oil", a product of coal tar, picric acid and benzole, was used as a machinery lubricant especially in the railroad industry and factories. The company located at Waltham, Massachusetts made 175,000 gallons of the lubricant before it was discontinued in 1859.|$|R
25|$|Because wood-tar {{creosote}} is {{used for}} its guaiacol and creosol content, it is generally derived from beechwood rather than other woods, since it distills with {{a higher proportion of}} those chemicals to other phenolics. The creosote can be obtained by <b>distilling</b> the wood <b>tar</b> and treating the fraction heavier than water with a sodium hydroxide solution. The alkaline solution is then separated from the insoluble oily layer, boiled in contact with air to reduce impurities, and decomposed by diluted sulphuric acid. This produces a crude creosote, which is purified by re-solution in alkali and re-precipitation with acid and then redistilled with the fraction passing over between 200° and 225° constituting the purified creosote.|$|R
40|$|Anthraquinone (AQ) (9, 10 -anthracenedione) is an {{important}} compound in commerce. Many structurally related AQ derivatives are medicinal natural plant products. Examples include 1 -hydroxyanthraquinone (1 -OH-AQ) and 2 -hydroxyanthraquinone (2 -OH-AQ), which are also metabolites of AQ. Some commercial AQ is produced by the oxidation of anthracene (AQ-OX). In the recent past, the anthracene used was <b>distilled</b> from coal <b>tar</b> and different lots of derived AQ often contained polycyclic aromatic hy-drocarbon contaminants, particularly 9 -nitroanthracene (9 -NA). Many toxicology studies on AQ used contaminated anthracene-derived AQ-OX, including a National Toxicology Program (NTP) 2 -year cancer bioassay that reported a weak to modest increase in tumors in the kidney and bladder {{of male and female}} F 344 /N rats and in the livers of male and female B 6 C 3 F 1 mice.

5000|$|Set up in 1633, {{a private}} pitch boilery started to produce pitch (by boiling tar) on the island, pitch {{at the time}} being both {{frequently}} used at the city's abundant shipyards and an important national trade item. The operations must have had quite an impact, since Queen Christina (1626-1689) when handing the area over to the city in 1647, explains she wished to see storehouses built on Bäck- eller Tiärholmen (The [...] "Pitch" [...] or [...] "Tar Islet") for [...] "the advantage and benefit {{of the city and}} the residents". Thus having both its name and reputation set, the islet was bestowed a <b>tar</b> <b>distilling</b> workshop, originally intended for the north-eastern shores of Södermalm, replacing the boilery during the 1680s. Private entrepreneurs took charge of the island in 1717 and, in spite of a devastating fire in 1723, developed it into an important part of their trading house.|$|R
50|$|The simple phenols are not {{the only}} active element in wood-tar creosote. In solution, they {{coagulate}} albumin, which is a water-soluble protein found in meat; so they serve as a preserving agent, but also cause denaturation. Most of the phenols in the creosote are methoxy derivatives—they contain the methoxy group linked to the benzene nucleus (O - CH3). The high level of methyl derivates created from the action of heat on wood (also apparent in the methyl alcohol produced through distillation) make wood-tar creosote substantially different from coal-tar creosote. Guaiacol is a methyl ether of pyrocatechin, while creosol is a methyl ether of methyl-pyrocatechin, the next homolog of pyrocatechin. Methyl ethers differ from simple phenols in being less hydrophilic, caustic and poisonous. This allows meat to successfully be preserved without tissue denaturation, and allows creosote {{to be used as a}} medical ointment.Because wood-tar creosote is used for its guaiacol and creosol content, it is generally derived from beechwood rather than other woods, since it distills with a higher proportion of those chemicals to other phenolics.
