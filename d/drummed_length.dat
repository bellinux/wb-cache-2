40|$|Abstract: Oil spill {{recovery}} {{by means}} of a rotating drum skimmer was investigated experimentally {{for a wide range of}} design and operating conditions. The effect of <b>drum</b> diameter, <b>drum</b> <b>length,</b> rotating speed, oil lm thickness, oil properties, and drum centre height above the oil/water interface surface were analyzed with respect to oil recovery rate of the drum skimmer. Crude, diesel, SAE 10 W and SAE 140 W oils were used during this investigation. It was found that oil recovery rate increases with increasing <b>drum</b> diameter, <b>drum</b> <b>length,</b> <b>drum</b> centre height above the oil/water interface, and oil slick thickness oil viscosity, and increases as oil density and surface tension decreases. The results revealed that the drum skimmer is an effective device for recovering spills of low viscosity oil, such as light crude oil, which is the type of oil involved in most serious spills and pollutions of the sea. Furthermore, an empirical equation is proposed for predicting the oil recovery rate of the device. The equation can be applied to different oils, and gives good agreement with observed data...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1984 Rotary dryers are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used wood drying system in the particleboard industry. These dryers also play an increasingly important role in drying wood residues for fuel. Many potential benefits may be realized through an improved understanding of the rotary drying process. A rotary dryer simulation model was developed, {{in the form of a}} computer program, for the purpose of analyzing the drying behavior of wood particles. The model is applicable to single pass rotary drums, with or without a centerfill flighting section. Modifications to the base program could be made to allow for alternative rotary drum designs, such as multiple pass drums. The approach used in the model development analyzed the rotary drying process in a sequential manner. Beginning with a study of particle residence time in a rotary drum, the process of heat transfer, and then mass transfer, were incorporated to yield a complete rotary dryer simulation model. The resultant computer program does not require empirical constants or equations developed for a particular rotary dryer system. Experiments on a commercially manufactured rotary dryer were performed to check the performance of the simulation model as a predictor of overall residence time and drying behavior. The variables tested were drum rotation rate, gas flow rate, and inlet gas temperature. Measurements of gas temperature, particle temperature, and particle moisture content were obtained along the <b>drum</b> <b>length.</b> Comparison between the predictions and the measured results were good, indicating a percent root mean square error of 22. 2 in the prediction of the outlet particle moisture content. A series of computer simulation trials were performed to check the affect of inlet particle moisture content, blend-box gas temperature, drum diameter, air leakage, <b>drum</b> <b>length,</b> gas volumetric flow rate, particle size, particle sphericity, drum speed, and angle of repose on dryer behavior. It was discovered that an optimal gas flow rate exists at which the greatest extent of drying may be achieved. In addition, the presence of centerfill flights enhances the extent of drying in a rotary dryer. The rotary dryer simulation model developed in this study should prove useful for optimizing process parameters in the drying of wood particles...|$|R
40|$|Closed-loop drying {{systems are}} an {{attractive}} alternative to conventional drying systems {{because they provide}} {{a wide range of}} potential advantages. Consequently, type of drying process is attracting increased interest. Rotary drying of wood particles can be assumed as an incorporated process involving fluid-solid interactions and simultaneous heat and mass transfer within and between the particles. Understanding these mechanisms during rotary drying processes may result in determination of the optimum drying parameters and improved dryer design. In this study, due to the complexity and nonlinearity of the momentum, heat, and mass transfer equations, a computerized mathematical model of a closed-loop triple-pass concurrent rotary dryer was developed to simulate the drying behavior of poplar wood particles within the dryer drums. Wood particle moisture content and temperature, drying air temperature, and drying air humidity ratio along the <b>drums</b> <b>lengths</b> can be simulated using this model. The model presented in this work has been shown to successfully predict the steady-state behavior of a concurrent rotary dryer and can be used to analyze the effects of various drying process parameters on the performance of the closed-loop triple-pass rotary dryer to determine the optimum drying parameters. The model was also used to simulate the performance of industrial closed-loop rotary dryers under various operating conditions...|$|R

Weights and measurements were made {{and in some cases}} converted to ratios and percentages to facilitate comparisons. Part weight:length ratios were demonstrated to be accurate measures of changes. Older birds and males had larger ratios, indicating more weight per unit length. Genetic cross differences were statistically significant in some cases. Part weight:length ratios were correlated with part weight and prediction equations were calculated. Breast weight:length ratio = 6. 66 +. 054 x, drumstick weight:length ratio = 1. 92 +. 064 x, and thigh weight:length ratio = 3. 04 +. 093 x with correlation coefficients of. 95,. 95, and. 96, respectively. Breasts were 1. 7 times {{as long as they were}} wide, no differences were found attributable to age or sex, and a genetic cross difference was found only in Study 3.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to explore the relationship among body measurements in 3 strains of broilers chicken (Arbor Acre, Marshal and Ross) using principal component analysis with the view of identifying those components that define body conformation in broilers. A total of 180 birds were used, 60 per strain. The parameters recorded at 8 weeks of age were body weight, shank length, thigh length, drumstick length, body length, body width, breast width and wing length. Principal component analysis with variance maximizing orthogonal rotation was used to extract the components. Two principal components were extracted in Arbor Acre which explained 65 % of the total variation in the original variables. Similarly three principal components each were extracted in Marshal and Ross strains accounting for 74. 76 % and 70 % of the total variance respectively. Generally, PC 1 had the largest share of the total variance and correlated highly with breast width, wing length, thigh length, shank length and body length. PC 1 was termed the generalized form of broilers. PC 2 had its loadings on <b>drum</b> stick <b>length,</b> breast width, thigh length and wing length while PC 3 had positive loading on drumstick length.

40|$|Chip size {{distribution}} {{is an important}} quality variable not only for buyers of forest fuels, but also for chipping contractors as it influences both fuel consumption and productivity of chippers. Studies of disc chippers and of drum chippers with closed drums have shown that increased chip target length increases chipper productivity and decreases fuel consumption per ton of chips produced. For open <b>drum</b> chippers, chip <b>length</b> is partly controlled by the mesh size in the sieve. In order to evaluate how this sieve affects productivity and fuel consumption of chippers, two open drum machines for professional chipping of forest fuels were studied. Small chippers were represented by a Kesla 645, and larger ones by an Eschlböck Biber 92. The Kesla 645 was studied with 25, 50, and 100 mm sieves and the Biber 92 with 35, 50, and 100 mm sieves. With the 100 mm sieve the Kesla chipper produced 14. 5 oven dry ton (odt) of chips per effective hour and the Biber 30. 0 odt per effective hour. Fuel consumption per odt was 3. 0 l for the Kesla and 2. 1 l for the Biber. A reduction of sieve mesh size decreased productivity and increased fuel consumption for both machines. Reducing the mesh size decreased the size of produced chips for the Kesla, {{but not for the}} Biber.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the physics of}} {{nanoscale}} mechanical resonators and oscillators is studied. We discuss two types of resonators. First, a top-down fabricated doubly clamped beam resonator with an integrated piezoelectric actuator is introduced. The second type of resonators are based on layered two-dimensional materials, such as graphene and molybdenum disulphide (MoS 2). In chapter 2 we discuss the dynamics of doubly clamped microbeam resonators. These resonators have an integrated piezoelectric actuator. To enhance the Q factor of these devices we employ an external feedback loop, and operate the resonator as an oscillator. With the feedback loop in place, we show a twenty times enhancement of the effective Q-factor. When the gain in the feedback loop exceeds the oscillation threshold, the oscillator becomes nonlinear and the frequency now depends on the gain and phase of the feedback loop. Two types of transitions occur: one showing a continuous transition from the linear to the nonlinear regime, and one displaying an instable transition with hysteresis. Next to top-down mechanical resonators, we have also considered resonators based on layered two-dimensional materials. To reliable measure {{the motion of the}}se resonators, which is challenging due to the limited thickness - of in the extreme case a single layer - we developed a Fabry Perot interferometer. The interference occurs between light reflected from two mirrors placed after each other. In this case, the front mirror is a suspended drum made from a layered material and the back mirror is the silicon substrate. Due to the motion of the <b>drum</b> the cavity <b>length</b> changes in time which results in a modulation of the reflected light intensity. To optimize the resonator geometry we derived an equation for the cavity reflectivity as a function of device parameters. In the first experiment done with the interferometer we measured the properties of suspended MoS 2 drum resonators with thicknesses ranging from a single layer to several layers. By measuring the frequency spectra of multiple drums we showed that resonators made of one to five layers exhibit membrane-like behavior. Drum resonators made of more than five layers display plate-like behavior. We further notice that the Q-factor measured at room temperature is remarkable low compared to other nanomechanical systems and is of the order of hundred. To investigate the Q-factor of drum resonators at room temperature we developed a measurement technique to determine the energy relaxation of the resonator in the time domain. This has been done by mixing the measured signal coming from the photodiode with the drive frequency. The mixing yields a component at dc and a component at approximately two times the drive frequency. By recording the dc component on an oscilloscope the ring up and ring down has been measured. By comparing the Q-factor from the measurement in the frequency domain with the Q-factor measured in the time domain, one can determine if the Q-factor is limited by dissipation or by spectral broadening. We found that the Q-factors in both measurements are equal. This indicates that in our drum resonators dissipation is the dominant loss factor at room temperature. In the last chapter we study the dynamics of a graphene oscillator with an external feedback loop. The feedback loop consists of a voltage controlled phase shifter and a variable gain amplifier. By adjusting the phase in the feedback loop we can access multiple regimes. First, we explore the regime of positive velocity proportional feedback, the same as we have done in chapter 2. We show a thirty five times enhancement of the effective Q-factor by applying feedback. By choosing the opposite phase, the damping is increased; this leads to a cooling of the oscillator motion and a smaller peak in the spectral response. As also observed in chapter 2, the oscillator becomes nonlinear and the oscillation frequency depends on the loop gain and phase when the gain exceeds the threshold for oscillation.
