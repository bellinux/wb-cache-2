5|$|The {{book was}} not {{intended}} to either present or defend any particular position in environmental ethics, but rather to explore what process philosophers could say or have said about environmental issues. There are, for Palmer, two key problems with a process approach to environmental ethics. The first concerns the value of human and nonhuman life; for process thinkers, the latter will always be trumped by the former in terms of value. The second concerns human perspectives; as process philosophy invariably models interpretation of all entities on human experience, it is not well-suited to characterising non-human nature. Palmer thus concludes that process philosophy <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> suitable basis for environmental ethics.|$|E
5|$|Each {{year the}} event has a theme, and {{includes}} a cocktail hour and a formal dinner. During the cocktail hour, guests arrive {{to walk on the}} red carpet, tour the year's special themed exhibition, and be seated before the dinner party that includes entertainment from the preeminent entertainers of the day. The theme not only sets the tone for the annual exhibit, but also for the guests who attempt to dress to uphold the theme of the year, oftentimes causing runs on certain fashion themes among the world's leading fashion retailers. Sometimes, such as in 2013, the theme is a bit befuddling because it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> clear stylistic directive, while at other times, such as 2014 the theme may be far more challenging to one gender than the other.|$|E

5|$|Northern mockingbirds are {{socially}} monogamous. The two sexes look alike except that males {{are a little}} larger in size than females. Mutual mate choice is exhibited in northern mockingbirds. Both males and females prefer mates that are more aggressive towards intruders, and so exhibit greater parental investment. However, males are more defensive of their nests than females. In a population where male breeding adults outnumber female breeding adults, females have more freedom in choosing their mates. In these cases, these female breeders {{have the option of}} changing mates within a breeding season if the first male <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> high level of parental care, which includes feeding and nest defense. High nesting success is associated with highly aggressive males attacking intruders in the territory, and so these males are preferred by females.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Gasparo Cairano before 1489. No {{information}} has been found about the date and place of his birth, education, or the circumstances {{that led him to}} Brescia. The appellation da Milano, with which he is often recalled in the sources, however, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> definitive fact of his origin because it could refer to the city {{as well as to the}} dukedom or diocese. The generic reference, in any case, is compatible with the cultural basis of his artistic work. Some conjectures can be made on the surname Cairano, in particular that it leads one to Cairate in Varese province, which is to this day shortened to Caira in the local dialect.|$|E

25|$|Knowledge {{is often}} defined as {{justified}} true belief, {{in that the}} belief must be considered to correspond to reality and must be derived from valid evidence and arguments.

25|$|Around {{the same}} time, Regalianus, who held some command in the Balkans, was proclaimed Emperor.

25|$|Occasionally, lawmakers {{attempt to}} {{introduce}} legislation outlawing all prostitution in Nevada. These efforts are typically supported by owners of casinos {{and other large}} businesses, claiming that legalized prostitution harms the state's image.

Rural lawmakers normally oppose these laws as well, {{despite the fact that}} legal brothel prostitution <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> significant amount of income for counties.|$|E
25|$|The Vice-President holds {{office for}} five years. The Vice-President can be re-elected {{any number of}} times.
