25|$|According to Li, {{everything}} he has <b>ever</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{tell the world}} can be found in three of his films: the message of Hero is that the suffering of one person can never be as significant as the suffering of a nation; Unleashed shows that violence is never a solution; and Fearless tells that the biggest enemy of a person is himself. Li thinks that the greatest weapon is a smile and the largest power is love.|$|E

25|$|As an X-Man she met Mephisto, Dr. Doom and the Fantastic Four, and the Horde. The X-Men later battled Freedom Force and the Adversary in Dallas, and, in a {{televised}} battle, sacrificed themselves to allow Forge to bind the Adversary; Roma secretly restored them to life, and gave Betsy the Siege Perilous, which they could use if they <b>ever</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> start new lives. The X-Men moved to the Reavers' Australian Outback base, from where they took on the Brood, Genoshan Magistrates, Mister Sinister and the Goblin Queen, M Squad, Mr. Jip and the Serpent Society, Master Mold and Nimrod, Nanny and the Orphan-Maker, and Zaladane and the Savage Land Mutates. As {{they were about to}} depart the Savage Land, Betsy had a precognitive flash of the Reavers killing the team. To prevent this, she sent them through the Siege Perilous.|$|E
25|$|MythDevelopers {{used this}} {{material}} {{to improve and}} further develop the games. Although their initial focus was on the bug-ridden release version of The Wolf Age, they also worked to update {{the first two games}} to newer operating systems on both Mac and PC, fix bugs, and create unofficial patches to enhance both the games themselves and the mapmaking tools. They also developed their own library, dubbed the Myth Core Library, which provided networking, input routines, and other low-level functions. This enabled MythDevelopers to avoid the necessity of licensing any external libraries, and instead allowed them to develop everything in-house. This was part of their deal with Take-Two, as they couldn't incorporate anything into the games which they would be unable to give Take-Two the rights to should the company ever ask for the source code back; all modifications remained the intellectual property of Take-Two, who were free to use them in a future commercial version of Myth, if they <b>ever</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> re-release an upgraded version of {{one or more of the}} games, or incorporate the modifications into the development of a new Myth game.|$|E

[...] He gave up hosting I've Got A Secret and was replaced by comedian Steve Allen, who would host the show until the end of its run in 1967 (although Moore had ended his retirement before I've Got A Secret left the air, he never returned to the series to host and Allen helmed a subsequent, one-season syndicated revival in 1972). Moore's main activity during his hiatus was a trip around the world with his wife.|$|E

500|$|Newell was {{the person}} to bring Washington out of the despair Kermit felt when he heard his playing career was {{probably}} over. Newell forced him through even more grueling training sessions the following summer, after some of which, Washington strongly considered quitting. His leg had atrophied from the injury and he was scared of re-injuring it during their training sessions. Newell ignored his pleas {{and told him that}} if he <b>ever</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> play again he had to train more than before and work even harder. Washington came back to play the following season and performed well; through the first 25 games he was averaging career highs in points (11.6) and rebounds (10.8). He had been featured in the NBA preview edition of Sports Illustrated (which was dedicated to enforcers that year) before the season and was praised therein for his intimidating nature and fighting skills.

500|$|The comic book's initial cancellation, and the {{introduction}} of the character to DC led to many negative feedback and reception.

As a result, DC co-publisher Dan Didio issued a statement defending this decision, stating that, [...] "Hellblazer's had a long and incredibly successful run and that's a tip of the hat to all the great creators that have worked on the book over the years. The new Constantine series will return him back to his roots in the DCU and hopefully be the start of another incredible run." [...] Comic Alliance described Hellblazer's cancellation as marking [...] "the end of an era for Vertigo" [...] while adding it to be [...] "one of a handful of comics from the late eighties that helped comic books and their readers grow up." ...|$|E

500|$|Upon {{release in}} 1968, 2001: A Space Odyssey {{was not an}} {{immediate}} hit among many critics, who faulted its lack of dialogue, slow pacing, and seemingly impenetrable storyline. [...] The film appeared to defy genre convention, much unlike any science-fiction movie before it, and clearly different from any of Kubrick's earlier films or stories. Kubrick was particularly outraged by a scathing review from Pauline Kael, who called it [...] "the biggest amateur movie of them all", with Kubrick doing [...] "really every dumb thing he <b>ever</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do". [...] Despite mixed reviews from critics at that time, 2001: A Space Odyssey gradually gained popularity and earned $31 million worldwide {{by the end of}} 1972. Today, it is widely considered {{to be one of the}} greatest and most influential films ever made, and is a staple on All Time Top 10 lists. Baxter describes the film as [...] "one of the most admired and discussed creations in the history of cinema", and Steven Spielberg has referred to it as [...] "the big bang of his film making generation". For LoBrutto it [...] "positioned Stanley Kubrick as a pure artist ranked among the masters of cinema".|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Love began {{composing}} {{an album}} with songwriter Linda Perry of 4 Non Blondes, titled America's Sweetheart, also reuniting with drummer Patty Schemel. Love signed with Virgin Records to release it, and began recording it in France in 2003. America's Sweetheart {{was released in}} February 2004, and received mixed reviews from critics. Charles Aaron of Spin called it a [...] "jaw-dropping act of artistic will and a fiery, proper follow-up to 1994's Live Through This" [...] and awarded it eight out of ten stars, while The Village Voice said: [...] " [...] willing to act out the dream of every teenage brat who <b>ever</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> have a glamorous, high-profile hissyfit, and she turns those egocentric nervous breakdowns into art. Sure, the art becomes less compelling when you've been pulling the same stunts for a decade. But, honestly, is there anybody out there who fucks up better?" [...] The album sold less than 100,000 copies. Love has publicly expressed her regret over the record several times, reasoning that her drug issues {{at the time were}} to blame: [...] "America's Sweetheart was my one true piece of shit. It has no cohesive thread. I just hate it", she said in a 2014 interview. Shortly after the record was released, Love told Kurt Loder on TRL: [...] "I cannot exist as a solo artist. It's a joke." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} immediately after Johnston finished the Britain's Got Talent live tour over a six-week period in London. The track listing, which contained both religious and popular songs, {{was chosen by}} Cowell; Johnston said [...] "I hadn't sung many of the tracks before. But I knew them all and, anyway, I like a challenge." [...] Johnston described recording the album as [...] "great", and said [...] "All I’ve <b>ever</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do is go into a studio and record an album and it was everything I’ve ever dreamed of." [...] Johnson recorded [...] "Walking in the Air" [...] as a duet with fellow Britain's Got Talent contestant Faryl Smith, and the song was tipped as a potential Christmas number-one. The recording was finished by September 2008, after which Johnston began to make appearances to publicise the release, including appearances on GMTV, Channel 5 News, BBC Breakfast, This Morning and Radio 2's Friday Night Is Music Night. In preparation for the album's promotion, Johnston received confidence tutoring. He said that [...] "I've got no confidence and sometimes people get on at me for being moody so I've had some help with that." [...] Johnston also received vocal training from Yvie Burnett, who was, at the time, coaching Leona Lewis and Leon Jackson, and with whom Smith trained during Britain's Got Talent. The album was produced by Nigel Wright.|$|E

The credits included new graphics as well as new cards for Gish and Pileggi. The finale episode of the series, [...] "The Truth", was written by series creator Carter; he later noted, [...] "It's the end—you don't get another chance. So you'd better put everything you've <b>ever</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> put in into the episode. There were things to distract us from what was really going on. The band was breaking up."

500|$|The show's {{crew and}} actors had {{a range of}} {{opinions}} about the show's finale, [...] "The Truth". Carter said of the finale, [...] "It's the end—you don't get another chance. So you'd better put everything you've <b>ever</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> put in into the episode. There were things to distract from what was going on. The band was breaking up." [...] Gish said, [...] "It did feel like a big movie set. We were on location, there was an enormous budget, and everyone came back." [...] Davis said, [...] "It was great that they brought us all back in the finale, that they {{found a way to}} get us all in again." [...] Pileggi said, [...] "I can remember the last day on the set. We shot a scene with Gillian and myself, and that was it. And then I had to say goodbye to another family, another crew. I almost teared up, and Gillian was standing there looking at me saying 'Okay, go ahead, big guy; get through this.' It was tough." [...] Patrick said, [...] "It was pretty euphoric, and sad, and all those emotions you can imagine. A chapter's closing, and we're all moving on to something new and exciting. And yet we were all going to miss each other." [...] Kim Manners called the final scene [...] "truly one of the most emotional experiences I've ever witnessed in my life." [...] Former lead actor Duchovny said, [...] "In some ways, psychically I didn't really leave. It was {{nice to be able to}} – I'm just really happy that I was able to come back and finish it." ...|$|E
500|$|Greater success {{came later}} in the year when Streep starred in the drama Sophie's Choice (also 1982), portraying a Polish {{holocaust}} survivor caught in a love triangle between a young naïve writer (Peter MacNicol) and a Jewish intellectual (Kevin Kline). Streep's emotional dramatic performance and her apparent mastery of a Polish accent drew praise. William Styron wrote the novel with Ursula Andress in mind for the role of Sophie, but Streep was determined to get the role. Streep filmed the [...] "choice" [...] scene in one take and refused to do it again, finding it extremely painful and emotionally exhausting. The scene in which Streep is ordered by an SS guard at Auschwitz to choose which one of her two children would be gassed and which would proceed to the labor camp, is her most famous scene, according to Emma Brockes of The Guardian who wrote in 2006: [...] "It's classic Streep, the kind of scene that makes your scalp tighten, but defter in a way is her handling of smaller, harder-to-grasp emotions". Among several acting awards, Streep won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance, and her characterization was voted the third greatest movie performance of all time by Premiere magazine. Roger Ebert said of her delivery, [...] "Streep plays the Brooklyn scenes with an enchanting Polish-American accent (she has the first accent I've <b>ever</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> hug), and she plays the flashbacks in subtitled German and Polish. There is hardly an emotion that Streep doesn't touch in this movie, and yet we're never aware of her straining. This {{is one of the most}} astonishing and yet one of the most unaffected and natural performances I can imagine." [...] Pauline Kael on the contrary called the film an [...] "infuriatingly bad movie" [...] and thought that Streep [...] "decorporealizes" [...] herself, which she believed explained why her movie heroines [...] "don't seem to be full characters, and why there are no incidental joys to be had from watching her".|$|E
