40|$|ABSTRACT: Thirteen {{patients}} who had seventeen slipped capital femoral epiphyses were managed with a spica cast between 1984 and 1986. The average time in the plaster cast was three months.

Further slipping <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> three hips once the cast had been removed, and chondrolysis <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> one of these hips. Chon-drolysis <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> eight additional hips, and the lesion was transient in four of them.
