40|$|Froggat {{suggested}} that the native primary blowflies in Australia began to attack living sheep because of a change of habit which resulted in their becoming attracted to their wool for oviposition or larviposition. They {{were supposed to have}} acquired this habit during great droughts when the carcasses of sheep formed {{a large part of the}} carrion on which they normally oviposited. During these times the flies deposited their eggs, or living larvae, among the wool of the dead sheep. Then ' the smell of the <b>dead</b> <b>wool</b> taught them that the allied damp or soiled wool (of living sheep) was of a similar character', and consequently they became attracted to the latter for purposes of oviposition or larviposition (Tillyard & Seddon, 1933).

The eggs are a lighter colour than those of other corvids, being smooth, a glossy pale blue or blue-green with darker {{speckles}} ranging from dark brown to olive or grey-violet. Egg size and weight varies slightly between subspecies; those of subspecies monedula average [...] and [...] in weight, those of subspecies soemmerringii [...] in size and [...] in weight, and those of subspecies spermologus [...] in size and [...] in weight. Clutches usually contain 4 or 5 eggs, although a Slovakian study found clutch sizes ranging from 2 to 9 eggs. The eggs are incubated by the female for 17–18 days until hatching as naked altricial chicks, which are completely dependent on the adults for food. They fledge after 28–35 days, and the parents continue to feed them for another four weeks or so.|$|R
