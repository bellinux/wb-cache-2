50|$|Peak debt is {{the stage}} at which an economy or an individual's debt {{servicing}} costs become so high relative to income that spending must slow down or stop. The term 'peak debt' was coined by Jaswant Jain PhD in 2006. Jain concluded that debt will eventually reach a limit at which point consumption must be reduced to pay the debt and interest. This reduction in consumption will inevitably have a deflationary or <b>disinflationary</b> effect.|$|E

50|$|The primary {{driver of}} sector {{rotation}} is {{the variability of}} currency values (inflationary, <b>disinflationary,</b> or deflationary) and interest rates. As the economy expands, demand for raw materials creates inflationary pressures, which in turn prompt higher interest rates, which increase {{the value of the}} currency, which reduces the competitiveness of a country's exports as the currency causes them to cost more to other countries. This final stage causes the economy to contract, reducing demand for raw materials, which creates deflationary pressures, which in turn prompt lower interest rates, which decrease the value of the currency, which increases the competitiveness of a country's exports—creating a new market cycle. The relative strength of commodities, bonds, currencies, and stocks shift in this changing monetary climate in a somewhat predictable manner.|$|E

To date, only two countries, Israel in the 1980s and 1990s and Poland in the 1990s, have managed to engage in successful de-dollarization without extensive negative consequences; both countries managed this transition through combining disinflation with a strong exchange rate anchor. Moreover, in addition to a one-year mandatory hold on dollar deposits, Israel undertook a series of [...] "patches" [...] including the following: i) CPI(Consumer Price Index)-indexed deposits; ii) requirements that banks undertake active hedging of currency risk for non-tradable activities; iii) active development of financial derivatives markets; and iv) efforts to deepen local currency bond markets.

Under less favorable circumstances, or in the absence of policies designed to facilitate adjustment, forced de-dollarization has provoked extensive capital flight and/or steep declines in financial intermediation.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} <b>disinflationary</b> {{experience}} between 1979 - 1993 for two traditionally inflationary {{countries of the}} European Monetary System: France and Italy. For each country, a vector autoregressive model is estimated. Shocks in the model combine domestic and foreign sources. The latter capture the world oil price shocks as well as nominal and real shocks originating in Germany. Under investigation is the hypothesis that shocks originating in Germany have a spillover <b>disinflationary</b> effect in France and Italy. The empirical evidence provides support to the validity of this hypothesis. Furthermore, German shocks account for an important share of the total price variance in France and Italy. These {{results indicate that the}} interaction between countries of the European Monetary System has contributed {{to the success of the}} <b>disinflationary</b> experiences of the eighties.

Allowing state changes can also help explain the price puzzle and justify the use of commodity prices as a corrective measure.

An examination of basic economic data reveals the shortcomings of existing explanations based on either inconsistent macroeconomic policies or self-fulfilling prophecies.

The analysis suggests that a prolonged period of real currency appreciation before the devaluation was made possible not only by the strong inflationary aversion of the authorities but by a series of positive shocks that reduced the appreciation's negative effects. ...|$|E

On average, over the 2001 - 06 period, the direct effect {{of consumer goods}} imported from China is estimated to have reduced the inflation rate by about 0. 1 percentage points per year. This <b>disinflationary</b> effect is due to two causes: first, the Chinese share of Canadian imports of consumer goods has been increasing rapidly in recent years, and second, the price of these goods is much lower in China than it is among Canada's other import sources, as well as domestic producers.

40|$|Inflation {{over the}} last 5 years has {{remained}} below 3 percent. Many economic observers applaud these results, arguing that inflation has ceased to matter much in the decisions of consumers and businesses. Others such as Martin Feldstein (1996), Lee Hoskins (1991), and Jerry Jordan (1993) advocate further gains on the inflationary front. Feldstein, for instance, argues that reducing the inflation rate to zero would ameliorate the tax distortions caused by inflation, producing substantial gains to the economy. He estimates that to achieve price stability the Federal Reserve would have to engineer a recession that reduces real gross domestic product by 5 percent. Feldstein holds that these costs are far outweighed by the benefits that would occur from reducing the misallocation of resources (in jargon, the deadweight losses) due to inflation. What he overlooks in his analysis is how {{the costs and benefits}} of such a policy would be shared. Who would bear the burdens from <b>disinflationary</b> monetary policy? Who would reap the benefits? Would such distributional consequences be desirable in the present economic environment? This working paper attempts to answer these questions first by considering based on economic principles how different sectors would be affected by <b>disinflationary</b> policy. The traditional "money" channel of monetary policy implies that employment in interest-sensitive industries should fall the most. The "credit" channel implies that small, financially-constrained firms should be hurt more than large, financially-stable firms. A slowdown in aggregate activity working through either channel would burden low-income workers more than high-income workers. Since minorities tend to have lower wages than whites, <b>disinflationary</b> policy should disproportionately affect them. Lenders such as bond holders would gain by an unanticipated decrease in inflation. ...|$|E

40|$|Although most macroeconomists {{agree that}} the control of {{inflation}} may involve losses of output, {{there is no consensus}} about why. New Classical economists, focusing on the issue of credibility, have identified incentive problems as important obstacles to price stability. On the contrary, many new Keynesians regard credibility problems as secondary. They focus on the microeconomic details of wage and price adjustments as potential sources of <b>disinflationary</b> costs. Yet, if the costs and the benefits of anti-inflationary policy are strictly related to the market structure of the economy, so will be the incentives tempting the monetary authority to inflate. Indeed, what we show in this thesis is that the microeconomic aspects of wage and price setting not only affect the costs (benefits) of credible <b>disinflationary</b> (inflationary) policy, but {{that they need to be}} considered to determine whether those <b>disinflationary</b> (inflationary) policies can be perceived as credible or not. Despite the relevance of this problem, the economic analysis of microfoundations has received little attention at the time of designing efficient resolutions for the credibility problem of monetary policy. This idea has been illustrated in different ways. First, Rogoff's idea of delegation does not seem very attractive, if the wage setting process appears to be dominated by insider workers. Moreover, we have underlined the difficulties that a country like Spain, with a highly distorted labour market, may face in fighting inflation. Second, interesting patterns of inflation and output behaviour may be generated by the interaction of both credibility problems and staggered wage setting. Finally, although the difficulties of implementing anti-inflationary policies are emphasised in all our examples, they are particularly severe when near-rational behaviour or, alternatively, costs of changing prices are taken into account...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{an approach}} to measuring real interest rates and testing hypotheses on their behavior. It then describes {{what we know about}} real interest rates in the aggregate economy and provides estimates of real interest rates for the agricultural sector. The evidence presented in this paper indicates that real interest rates for the agricultural economy have been extremely high in the l 98 Ds and that their behavior seems to be linked to that found for real rates in the aggregate economy. What has been the source of these high real rates? The answer seems to be that it was a result of a concerted effort by the monetary authorities to disinflate the economy. However, the brunt of the Fed's <b>disinflationary</b> policy has fallen more heavily on the farm sector which has had to face far higher reel rates {{than the rest of the}} economy. Although breaking the back of inflation was certainly a worthy goal for the Fed, farmers have had to pay a heavy price.

40|$|The {{prices of}} {{maturing}} US Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) {{during the last}} 6 -month coupon period reveal whether the market is anticipating an inflationary or <b>disinflationary</b> regime. Against the benchmark of the Treasury bill yield to adjust for the time value of money, maturing TIPS prices represent a sequence of updated forecasts of {{the consumer price index}} (CPI) to be used to determine the final single cash flow on the maturity date. Under the assumption of risk-neutrality, the sequence of forecasts is modelled as a martingale. Generalized method of moments and regression analysis are used to test two martingale properties of the CPI forecasts: (1) the unconditional mean of daily changes in the CPI forecasts is zero and (2) serial correlations of the daily changes in the CPI forecasts are zero. The test statistics reject both martingale properties of the CPI forecasts implied in maturing TIPS prices. A persistent upward movement of the CPI forecasts toward the actual target CPI during the first quarter of 2002 implies the market was then anticipating a <b>disinflationary</b> regime. One policy implication is that time series behaviour of CPI forecasts can provide timely feedback to the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{potential}} {{changes in}} monetary policy {{over the last}} decades using a nonparametric vector autoregression model. In the proposed model, the conditional mean and variance are time-dependent and estimated using a nonparametric local linear method, which allows for different forms of nonlinearity, conditional heteroskedasticity, and non-normality. Our results suggest {{that there have been}} gradual and abrupt changes in the variances of shocks, in the monetary transmission mechanism, and in the Fed’s reaction function. The response of output was strongest during Volcker’s <b>disinflationary</b> period and has since been slowly decreasing over time. There have been some abrupt changes in the response of inflation, especially in the early 1980 s, but we can not conclude that it is weaker now than in previous periods. Finally, we find significant evidence that policy was passive during some parts of Burn’s period, and active during Volcker’s <b>disinflationary</b> period and Greenspan’s period. However, we find that the uncovered behavior of the parameters is more complex than general conclusions suggest, since they display considerable nonlinearities over time. A particular appeal of the recursive estimation of the proposed VAR-ARCH is the detection of discrete local deviations as well as more gradual ones, without smoothing the timing or magnitude of the changes. ...|$|E
