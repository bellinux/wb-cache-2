5000|$|A T-nut, T nut, or tee nut (also {{known as}} a <b>blind</b> <b>nut,</b> which can however also refer to a rivet nut or an insert nut) {{is a type of}} nut used to fasten a wood, {{particle}} or composite materials workpiece, leaving a flush surface.|$|R
40|$|An {{aggravating}} {{international competition}} {{and the necessity of}} flexible assembling even in single item production systems force the rail vehicle industry to innovative technical solutions including the connection technologies. Therefore, screw connections with <b>blind</b> riveted <b>nuts</b> are used for the assembling of the interior construction in railway vehicles. Based on the needed class of risk, the load capacity of the preloaded screw connections with <b>blind</b> riveted <b>nuts</b> must be proved in accordance with the technical standards. The assumptions for screw connections underlying these technical standards are partly applicable on the connections with <b>blind</b> riveted <b>nuts.</b> On that account, the following article describes a procedure to generate the necessary proof in an experimental way...|$|R
50|$|The {{acorn nut}} {{is a type}} of {{fastener}} which gets its name from its shape. Acorn nut is its common name and it is also called a crown hex <b>nut,</b> <b>blind</b> <b>nut,</b> cap nut or domed cap nut. It is a nut that has a domed top to cover the threads. This is to prevent contact with the external thread to protect the threads or protect other things the threads would rub against. In addition the dome gives a more finished appearance. It is usually made of brass, steel, stainless steel (low carbon content) or nylon. It can also be chrome plated and given a mirror finish.|$|R
40|$|The steel {{thin-walled}} {{structures are}} widespread in civil and industrial engineering nowadays. Self-drilling screws or rivets {{are used to}} interconnect thin-walled elements. <b>Blind</b> rivets and <b>nuts</b> as connectors are considered in the frames of this paper. Rivets have some benefits over self-drilling screws. They are: we can obtain more dense connection when using rivets. So we can increase bearing capacity of connection; a lower cost of riveted connection; a large variety of installation tools for riveted connection: manual, pneumatic, battery; side; an easy installation: access to the connected element is required only from one. These benefits provide increasingly growling popularity to rivets. In the paper 4 types of rivets are considered: combined (aluminum/steel) blind rivets, zinc-coated steel blind rivets, stainless steel blind rivets and <b>blind</b> <b>nuts.</b> The features of each type of rivets are described in the paper. The influence on the behaviour of connections is revealed. The results of experimental research performed by the authors are presented in the paper. A bearing capacity shear of riveted connections is studied in the experiment. There are 3 types of riveted connections subjected to experiment: connection made by blind combined rivets; connection made by zinc-coated steel blind rivets; connection made by <b>blind</b> <b>nuts.</b> A connection between elements with significantly different thicknesses is modeled in the experiment. In reality this situation takes place, for example, in the roofing of buildings, where trapezoidal sheet can be fastened to purlin by rivets. As {{a result of the}} experiment the authors found out that the local deformations occuring under rivet head in the thick element significantly affect the behaviour and bearing capacity of the connection. That’s why the results of connection's bearing capacity obtained in tests were lower than the bearing capacity of rivet declared by manufacturers...|$|R
40|$|A <b>blind</b> rivet <b>nut</b> is a {{mechanical}} fastener enabling a fast installation from one side. The setting process relies on plastic deformation due to axial compression of the rivet nut {{in such a}} way that a bulge is formed on the underside of the work piece. The mechanical performance of such a connection partly depends on the final geometry of the rivet nut after forming. In this contribution, the torque-to-turn resistance of an internally threaded round tubular rivet is studied with the aid of finite element techniques. A strategy is presented to simulate the setting process involving large plastic strains and contact pressures. An FE-based inverse method was used to identify the local plastic material properties of the <b>blind</b> rivet <b>nut.</b> The forming simulation was validated in terms of predicted shape of the rivet nut and the evolution of the setting force. A quasi-static FE model using the shape and solution variables of the deformed rivet nut was used to reproduce the torque-to-turn resistance as a function of the setting force. Finally, the aim is to apply the presented modelling strategy to explore innovative possibilities to increase the torque-to-turn resistance of a <b>blind</b> rivet <b>nut.</b> status: accepte...|$|R

50|$|A rivet nut, {{also known}} as a <b>blind</b> rivet <b>nut</b> or {{threaded}} insert, is a one-piece internally threaded and counterbored tubular rivet that can be anchored entirely from one side. There are two types: one is designed to form a bulge on {{the back side of the}} panel as a screw is tightened in its threads. The other is similarly drawn in using a screw, but is drawn into the sleeve instead of creating a bulge.|$|R
40|$|In {{the work}} is {{presented}} the investigation of influence of fiber arrangement of a laminate on the values of stresses in the composite panel of a modified freight wagon using the FEM method. The conducted investigations concerned the reduced part of a side panel of a freight wagon. On this panel were mounted the tested composite panels. For this purpose, a special screw connection with a <b>blind</b> rivet <b>nut</b> was used. The first stage of works included manufacturing of a composite material consisting of four layers of a laminate. Each layer of the laminate is a composition of epoxy resin and carbon fibers with a plain weave in which fibers strands are woven at the angle of 90 °. In the next step it was changed the main angle of placement of fibers in all layers of the laminate. Wherein, all layers of the laminate were characterized with the same angle of fibers {{with respect to the}} global coordinate system used in the numerical test. As a result of the study it was observed the relationship between the main angle of fibers of the composite material and the values of stresses occurring in the composite plate...|$|R
