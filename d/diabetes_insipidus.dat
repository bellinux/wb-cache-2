5|$|Some Giant Schnauzers develop central <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus,</b> {{autosomal}} recessive hypothyroidism, selective malabsorption of cobalamin, narcolepsy, cataplexy, and various seizure disorders. Some are also sensitive to sulphonamides and gold. Bone diseases and joint problems are also an issue. The most common {{causes of death}} in Giant Schnauzers are lymphoma and liver cancer, followed by heart attacks and heart failure.|$|E
5|$|Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) {{deficiency}} {{leads to}} the syndrome of <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> (unrelated to diabetes mellitus): inability to concentrate the urine, leading to polyuria (production of large amounts of clear urine) that is low in solutes, dehydration and—in compensation—extreme thirst and constant need to drink (polydipsia), as well as hypernatremia (high sodium levels in the blood). ADH deficiency may be masked if there is ACTH deficiency, with symptoms only appearing when cortisol has been replaced.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms of <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> should {{prompt a}} formal fluid {{deprivation}} test {{to assess the}} body's response to dehydration, which normally causes concentration of the urine and increasing osmolarity of the blood. If these parameters are unchanged, desmopressin (an ADH analogue) is administered. If the urine then becomes concentrated and the blood osmolarity falls, {{there is a lack}} of ADH due to lack of pituitary function ("cranial diabetes insipidus"). In contrast, there is no change if the kidneys are unresponsive to ADH due to a different problem ("nephrogenic diabetes insipidus").|$|E
5|$|After {{an episode}} of {{pituitary}} apoplexy, 80% of people develop hypopituitarism and require some form of hormone replacement therapy. The most common problem is growth hormone deficiency, which is often left untreated but may cause decreased muscle mass and strength, obesity and fatigue. 60–80% require hydrocortisone replacement (either permanently or when unwell), 50–60% need thyroid hormone replacement, and 60–80% of men require testosterone supplements. Finally, 10–25% develop <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus,</b> the inability to retain fluid in the kidneys {{due to a lack}} of the pituitary antidiuretic hormone. This may be treated with the drug desmopressin, which can be applied as a nose spray or taken by mouth.|$|E
25|$|Hereditary {{forms of}} <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> account {{for less than}} 10% of the cases of <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> seen in {{clinical}} practice.|$|E
25|$|Nephrogenic <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> {{is due to}} the {{inability}} of the kidney to respond normally to vasopressin.|$|E
25|$|Diabetes insipidus* in dogs can be central, {{caused by}} a lack of {{antidiuretic}} hormone (ADH), or nephrogenic, {{caused by a}} lack of response of the kidneys to ADH. Neither form is common. Central <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> (CDI) is usually idiopathic, but can also be caused by head trauma or tumors of the brain. Nephrogenic <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> (NDI) can be primary (hereditary) or secondary (caused by a variety of metabolic and renal diseases, including Cushing's syndrome and pyometra). Because the disease is characterized by an inability to concentrate urine, the most common sign is increased drinking and urinating. Treatment of CDI is to use desmopressin, a synthetic analog of ADH. Treatment of NDI is to treat the underlying cause, if any.|$|E
25|$|Decreased AVP release (neurogenic— i.e. due {{to alcohol}} {{intoxication}} or tumour) or decreased renal sensitivity to AVP (nephrogenic, i.e. by mutation of V2 receptor or AQP) leads to <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus,</b> a condition featuring hypernatremia (increased blood sodium concentration), polyuria (excess urine production), and polydipsia (thirst).|$|E
25|$|Vasopressin is used {{to manage}} anti-diuretic hormone deficiency. It has off-label uses and {{is used in the}} {{treatment}} of vasodilatory shock, gastrointestinal bleeding, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular defibrillation. Vasopressin {{is used to}} treat <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> related to low levels of antiduretic hormone.It is available as Pressyn.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> (DI) is a {{condition}} characterized by large amounts of dilute urine and increased thirst. The amount of urine produced can be nearly 20 liters per day. Reduction of fluid has {{little effect on the}} concentration of the urine. Complications may include dehydration or seizures.|$|E
25|$|Granulomas in the {{pituitary}} gland, {{which produces}} numerous hormones, is rare but leads {{to any of}} the symptoms of hypopituitarism: amenorrhoea (cessation of the menstrual cycle), <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> (dehydration due to inability to concentrate the urine), hypothyroidism (decreased activity of the thyroid) or hypocortisolism (deficiency of cortisol).|$|E
25|$|The term {{hypopituitarism}} {{is often}} used interchangeably with GH deficiency by endocrinologists but more often denotes GH deficiency plus deficiency {{of at least one}} other anterior pituitary hormone. When GH deficiency (usually with other anterior pituitary deficiencies) is associated with posterior pituitary hormone deficiency (usually <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus),</b> the condition is termed panhypopituitarism.|$|E
25|$|Lithium-induced nephrogenic DI may be {{effectively}} managed {{with the administration}} of amiloride, a potassium-sparing diuretic often {{used in conjunction with}} thiazide or loop diuretics. Clinicians have been aware of lithium toxicity for many years, and traditionally have administered thiazide diuretics for lithium-induced polyuria and nephrogenic <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus.</b> However, amiloride has recently been shown to be a successful treatment for this condition.|$|E
25|$|Habit {{drinking}} (in its severest form termed psychogenic polydipsia) is {{the most}} common imitator of <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> at all ages. While many adult cases in the medical literature are associated with mental disorders, most patients with habit polydipsia have no other detectable disease. The distinction is made during the water deprivation test, as some degree of urinary concentration above isoosmolar is usually obtained before the patient becomes dehydrated.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} types of DI, each with a {{different}} set of causes. Central DI (CDI) is {{due to a lack of}} the hormone vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone). This can be due to damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland or genetics. Nephrogenic <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> (NDI) occurs when the kidneys do not respond properly to vasopressin. Dipsogenic DI is due to abnormal thirst mechanisms in the hypothalamus while gestational DI occurs only during pregnancy. Diagnosis is often based on urine tests, blood tests, and the fluid deprivation test. Diabetes mellitus is a separate condition with an unrelated mechanism, though both can result in the production of large amounts of urine.|$|E
25|$|Iatrogenic {{conditions}} do {{not necessarily}} result from medical errors, such as mistakes made in surgery, or the prescription or dispensing of the wrong therapy, such as a drug. In fact, intrinsic and sometimes adverse effects of a medical treatment are iatrogenic. For example, radiation therapy and chemotherapy — necessarily aggressive for therapeutic effect — frequently produce such iatrogenic effects as hair loss, hemolytic anemia, <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus,</b> vomiting, nausea, brain damage, lymphedema, infertility, etc. The loss of function resulting from the required removal of a diseased organ is iatrogenic, {{as in the case}} of diabetes consequential to the removal of all or part of the pancreas.|$|E
25|$|The reports {{created a}} sensation. Oliver was not slow to try adrenal {{extracts}} in patients, orally again and rather indiscriminately, from Addison's disease, hypotension (″loss of vasomotor tone″), Diabetes mellitus and <b>Diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> to Graves' disease (″exophthalmic goitre″). It seems he adhered to contemporary ideas of organotherapy, believing that powerful substances existed in tissues {{and ought to}} be discovered for medicinal use. In fact he immediately went on to extract the pituitary gland and, again with Schäfer, discovered vasopressin. In 1903 adrenaline, meanwhile purified, was first used in asthma. The use was based, not on the bronchodilator effect, which was discovered later, but on the vasoconstrictor effect, which was hoped to alleviate the “turgidity of the bronchial mucosa” – presumably vascular congestion and edema. Also as of 1903, adrenaline was added to local anesthetic solutions. The surgeon Heinrich Braun in Leipzig showed that it prolonged the anesthesia at the injection site and simultaneously reduced ″systemic″ effects elsewhere in the body.|$|E
500|$|Hormonal {{disturbances}} {{may occur}} secondary to hypopituitarism, occurring immediately or years after injury in 10 to 15% of TBI patients. Development of <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> or an electrolyte abnormality acutely after injury indicate need for endocrinologic work up. Signs {{and symptoms of}} hypopituitarism may develop and be screened for in adults with moderate TBI and in mild TBI with imaging abnormalities. [...] Children with moderate to severe head injury may also develop hypopituitarism. Screening should take place 3 to 6 months, and 12 months after injury, but problems may occur more remotely.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> is also {{associated}} with some serious diseases of pregnancy, including pre-eclampsia, HELLP syndrome and acute fatty liver of pregnancy. [...] These cause DI by impairing hepatic clearance of circulating vasopressinase. [...] It {{is important to consider}} these diseases if a woman presents with <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> in pregnancy, because their treatments require delivery of the baby before the disease will improve. [...] Failure to treat these diseases promptly can lead to maternal or perinatal mortality.|$|E
2500|$|... "Insipidus" [...] {{comes from}} Latin {{language}} insipidus (tasteless), from Latin: in- [...] "not" [...] + sapidus [...] "tasty" [...] from sapere [...] "have a taste" [...] — the full meaning is [...] "lacking flavor or zest; not tasty". Application of this name to DI arose from [...] {{the fact that}} <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> does not cause glycosuria (excretion of glucose into the urine).|$|E
2500|$|Whilst <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> usually {{occurs with}} {{polydipsia}}, {{it can also}} rarely occur {{not only in the}} absence of polydipsia but in the presence of its opposite, adipsia (or hypodipsia). [...] "Adipsic diabetes insipidus" [...] is recognised as a marked absence of thirst even in response to hyperosmolality. In some cases of adipsic DI, the patient may also fail to respond to desmopressin.|$|E
2500|$|Treatment {{involves}} drinking sufficient fluids {{to prevent}} dehydration. Other treatments {{depend on the}} type. In central and gestational disease treated is with desmopressin. Nephrogenic disease may be treated by addressing the underlying cause {{or the use of}} a thiazide, aspirin, or ibuprofen. The number of new cases of <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> each year is 3 in 100,000. Central DI usually starts between the ages of 10 and 20 and occurs in males and females equally. Nephrogenic DI can begin at any age. The term [...] "diabetes" [...] is derived from the Greek word meaning siphon.|$|E
2500|$|Type1 and type2 {{diabetes}} {{were identified as}} separate conditions {{for the first time}} by the Indian physicians Sushruta and Charaka in 400–500CE with type1 associated with youth and type2 with being overweight. The term [...] "mellitus" [...] or [...] "from honey" [...] was added by the Briton John Rolle in the late 1700s to separate the condition from <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus,</b> which is also associated with frequent urination. Effective treatment was not developed until {{the early part of the}} 20th century, when Canadians Frederick Banting and Charles Herbert Best isolated and purified insulin in 1921 and 1922. This was followed by the development of the long-acting insulin NPH in the 1940s.|$|E
2500|$|This test {{measures}} {{the changes in}} body weight, urine output, and urine composition when fluids are withheld to induce dehydration. [...] The body's normal response to dehydration is to conserve water by concentrating the urine. [...] Those with DI continue to urinate large amounts of dilute urine in spite of water deprivation. In primary polydipsia, the urine osmolality should increase and stabilize at above 280 Osm/kg with fluid restriction, while a stabilization at a lower level indicates <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus.</b> Stabilization in this test means, more specifically, when the increase in urine osmolality is less than 30 Osm/kg per hour {{for at least three}} hours. Sometimes measuring blood levels of ADH toward the end of this test is also necessary, but is more time consuming to perform.|$|E
2500|$|Desmopressin will be {{ineffective}} in nephrogenic DI which is treated by reversing {{the underlying cause}} (if possible) and replacing the free water deficit. The diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (a thiazide diuretic) or indomethacin {{can be used to}} create mild hypovolemia which encourages salt and water uptake in proximal tubule and thus improve nephrogenic <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus.</b> Amiloride has additional benefit of blocking Na uptake. Thiazide diuretics are sometimes combined with amiloride to prevent hypokalemia. It seems paradoxical to treat an extreme diuresis with a diuretic, and the exact mechanism of action is unknown but the thiazide diuretics will decrease distal convoluted tubule reabsorption of sodium and water, thereby causing diuresis. [...] This decreases plasma volume, thus lowering the glomerular filtration rate and enhancing the absorption of sodium and water in the proximal nephron. [...] Less fluid reaches the distal nephron, so overall fluid conservation is obtained.|$|E
2500|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} is {{a disease}} in which the beta cells of the endocrine pancreas either stop producing insulin or can no longer produce it in enough quantity for the body's needs. The condition is commonly divided into two types, depending {{on the origin of}} the condition: Type 1 diabetes, sometimes called [...] "juvenile diabetes", is caused by destruction of the beta cells of the pancreas. The condition is also referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes, meaning exogenous insulin injections must replace the insulin the pancreas is no longer capable of producing for the body's needs. Dogs can have insulin-dependent, or Type 1, diabetes; research finds no Type 2 diabetes in dogs. Because of this, there is no possibility the permanently damaged pancreatic beta cells could re-activate to engender a remission as may be possible with some feline diabetes cases, where the primary type of diabetes is Type 2. There is another less common form of diabetes, <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus,</b> which is a condition of insufficient antidiuretic hormone or resistance to it.|$|E
2500|$|Reduced salivary {{flow rate}} is {{associated}} with increased caries since the buffering capability of saliva is not present to counterbalance the acidic environment created by certain foods. As a result, medical conditions that {{reduce the amount of}} saliva produced by salivary glands, in particular the submandibular gland and parotid gland, are likely to lead to dry mouth and thus to widespread tooth decay. Examples include Sjögren's syndrome, diabetes mellitus, <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus,</b> and sarcoidosis. Medications, such as antihistamines and antidepressants, can also impair salivary flow. Stimulants, most notoriously methylamphetamine, also occlude the flow of saliva to an extreme degree. This is known as meth mouth. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active chemical substance in cannabis, also causes a nearly complete occlusion of salivation, known in colloquial terms as [...] "cotton mouth". Moreover, 63% of the most commonly prescribed medications in the United States list dry mouth as a known side-effect. Radiation therapy {{of the head and neck}} may also damage the cells in salivary glands, somewhat increasing the likelihood of caries formation.|$|E
2500|$|In central herniation, the {{diencephalon}} {{and parts}} of the temporal lobes of both of the cerebral hemispheres are squeezed through a notch in the tentorium cerebelli. [...] Transtentorial herniation can occur when the brain moves either up or down across the tentorium, called ascending and descending transtentorial herniation respectively; however descending herniation is much more common. [...] Downward herniation can stretch branches of the basilar artery (pontine arteries), causing them to tear and bleed, known as a Duret hemorrhage. The result is usually fatal. Other symptoms of this type of herniation include small, dilated, fixed pupils with paralysis of upward eye movement giving the characteristic appearance of [...] "sunset eyes". Also found in these patients, often as a terminal complication is the development of <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> due to the compression of the pituitary stalk. [...] Radiographically, downward herniation is characterized by obliteration of the suprasellar cistern from temporal lobe herniation into the tentorial hiatus with associated compression on the cerebral peduncles. [...] Upwards herniation, on the other hand, can be radiographically characterized by obliteration of the quadrigeminal cistern. Intracranial hypotension syndrome has been known to mimic downwards transtentorial herniation.|$|E
50|$|Nephrogenic <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> (also {{known as}} renal <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus)</b> {{is a form}} of <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> {{primarily}} due to pathology of the kidney. This is in contrast to central/neurogenic <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus,</b> which is caused by insufficient levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH, that is, arginine vasopressin or AVP). Nephrogenic <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> is caused by an improper response of the kidney to ADH, leading to a decrease in the ability of the kidney to concentrate the urine by removing free water.|$|E

50|$|Although {{they shared}} a name, {{diabetes}} mellitus and <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> are two separate conditions. Both cause excessive urination (hence the similarity in name), but whereas <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> {{is a problem with}} the production of antidiuretic hormone (central <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus)</b> or the kidneys' response to antidiuretic hormone (nephrogenic <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus),</b> diabetes mellitus causes polyuria via osmotic diuresis, due to the high blood sugar leaking into the urine, taking excess water along with it.|$|E
50|$|Central <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus,</b> {{also called}} neurogenic <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus,</b> {{is a type}} of <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> {{due to a lack of}} {{vasopressin}} (ADH) production in the brain. Vasopressin acts to increase the volume of blood (intravascularly), and decrease the volume of urine produced. Therefore, a lack of it causes increased urine production and volume depletion.|$|E
