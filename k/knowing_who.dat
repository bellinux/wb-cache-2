I'm running my career. That comes with being labeled a bitch. If that's what I'm gonna be called by being {{assertive}} and <b>knowing</b> <b>who</b> I am and what I want out of life, then so be it. I will wear that label proudly. For me it's about turning that word into a positive.|$|E

5|$|The {{city was}} home {{to at least one}} al-Qaeda leader before bin Laden. Operational chief Abu Faraj al-Libi {{reportedly}} moved his family to Abbottabad in mid-2003. Pakistan Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) raided the house in December 2003 but did not find him. However, this account was exposed as an outright lie by American officials who said that satellite photos show that in 2004 the site was an empty field. A courier told interrogators that al-Libi used three houses in Abbottabad. Pakistani officials say they informed their American counterparts {{at the time that the}} city could be a hiding place for al-Qaeda leaders. In 2009 officials began providing the U.S. with intelligence about bin Laden's compound without <b>knowing</b> <b>who</b> lived there.|$|E

25|$|Parallels {{have been}} drawn between the Visitors and US Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, though Peters and co-producer Jeffrey Bell refute that they were intentional. Bell feels that while the {{original}} series {{was more of a}} military show with a clear enemy, the reimagining focuses more on the paranoia of not <b>knowing</b> <b>who</b> can be trusted. The episode incorporates aspects of the original series, including the Visitors' giant spaceships, but is quick to reveal the Visitors' true motivations, as Peters felt awareness of the original story was already high.|$|E

Near {{the end of this}} tale, having achieved the release of many people from King Arthur's court who had been held prisoner in this land, including Queen Guinevere, Lancelot attends a tournament in disguise, wearing a red shield. He is invincible but then, following secret instructions from Queen Guinevere, he behaves like an incompetent fool, then he as an invincible knight once again, before leaving the tournament without anybody except the queen <b>knowing</b> <b>who</b> it is.|$|E

25|$|The other {{lead that}} was {{discarded}} {{was one that}} suggested that Tobares was kidnapped for ransom, mainly because his possible abductors have not reached out to his family for a payment. They kept an eye for any activity on Tobares' bank accounts {{to see if they}} were used after he went missing. Investigators analyzed his latest activity on social media as well. His last activity was on Facebook, where Tobares made a profile picture change on May 28, a few days before he went missing. Investigators believe that Tobares was probably hired as a cook by a drug lord for a party or event without him <b>knowing</b> <b>who</b> he was cooking for. At some point, investigators alleged, Tobares might have seen something suspicious that put him in danger, or might have had a problem with someone at those private events. In addition, investigators concluded that Tobares might have been a victim of gang retaliation. They allege that rival gang members might have kidnapped Tobares {{to send a message to}} his employers.|$|E
25|$|Around this time, the time-traveller Kang the Conqueror {{arrived in}} Egypt and assumed the {{identity}} of Pharaoh Rama-Tut. <b>Knowing</b> <b>who</b> En Sabah Nur was fated to become and where he was, Rama-Tut sent his General Ozymandias and an army to destroy the Sandstormers and find the young Apocalypse. En Sabah Nur and Baal were injured and sought refuge in a cave. Before he died, Baal revealed advanced alien technology hidden in the cave, {{left behind by the}} deity-like aliens known as Celestials. Vowing revenge on Rama-Tut, En Sabah Nur entered the Pharaoh's city posing as a slave and drew the romantic attention of Ozymandias's sister, Nephri. On seeing the mutant's true appearance, Nephri rejected him and turned to her brother for protection. Heartbroken, En Sabah Nur's rage caused his mutant abilities to fully emerge. Rampaging, he renamed himself Apocalypse. Rama-Tut fled and En Sabah Nur used the Celestial technology to transform his former tormentor Ozymandias into a blind clairvoyant made of living stone, now enslaved to Apocalypse. As the years went on, Apocalypse found he no longer aged.|$|E
25|$|On {{the second}} day of the offensive, British troops {{continued}} to fall back, losing their last footholds on the original front line. Thick fog impeded operations and did not disperse until early afternoon. Isolated engagements took place as the Germans pressed forward and the British held their posts, often not <b>knowing</b> <b>who</b> was to either side of them. Brigade and battalion control over events was absent. It was a day of stubborn and often heroic actions by platoons, sections and even individuals isolated from their comrades by the fragmented nature of the battle and lack of visibility. The greatest danger facing the British on 22 March was that the Third and Fifth armies might become separated. Byng did not order a retirement from the Flesqui√®res salient, which his army had won at such cost and Haig ordered him to keep in contact with the Fifth Army, even if that required a further retreat; the day also saw the first French troops enter the battle on the southern flank.|$|E

25|$|Ipomadon {{travels the}} world, {{fighting}} in tournaments, becomes King of Apulia following his father's death, and hears {{one day that}} the Proud is being besieged in her city by a knight called Lyoline. This ugly knight is threatening to take her away with him to India. Ipomadon {{makes his way to}} King Maleager's court once again, just in time to witness the arrival of the Proud's messenger, begging for some assistance for her lady. But curiously, Ipomadon has chosen to arrive at King Maleager's court {{in such a way that}} he is not recognised, not even by the queen. He pretends to be a fool, and the reader (or listener) is treated to a comic scene in which the fool Ipomadon is first ridiculed and then accepted by the knights and noblemen, little <b>knowing</b> <b>who</b> he really is. Cabanus is conveniently absent from court on this occasion. The maiden who has been sent as a messenger by the Proud is mightily unimpressed that a fool should wish to take on the challenge, but since nobody else in the court seems at all inclined to offer their services, the king allows Ipomadon the fool to take it up.|$|E

A decision was made to go with a younger actor for Bruce Wayne, and an offer was made to Ethan Hawke, who turned it down.
