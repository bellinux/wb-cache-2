40|$|Why is it {{that the}} laws of war, or {{international}} humanitarian law (IHL), allow no justification for breaking the law even if where such conduct would actually produce less humanitarian harm than following the law? In introducing the concept of a humanitarian necessity justification, this paper suggests that it should. It first addresses the puzzle of IHL’s existing absolutist stance through three historical case studies in which actors broke the law under a claim of necessity, or a mixed concern for self and others: The “Early Warning Procedure” employed by the IDF in the West Bank, the generic case of torture, and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It then examines whether the domestic necessity defense in criminal law might be transposed onto the international level, ultimately finding that such transposition is impossible. In further searching for an account for IHL’s absolutist stance, the paper turns to first-order accounts – deontological, consequential, and institutional – only to demonstrate that none of these accounts offers a convincing explanation for the exclusion of a humanitarian necessity paradigm. Ultimately, the paper offers a blueprint for a definition for a humanitarian necessity justification that would exculpate an actor who violated the laws of war {{in the name of a}} greater <b>humanitarian</b> <b>good.</b> The central component of the definition is a requirement that the greater <b>humanitarian</b> <b>good</b> would be for the benefit of the enemy, rather than for oneself. Under such paradigm, the Early Warning Procedure and perhaps even the atomic bombing of Hiroshima might be justified, while the paradigmatic case of interrogational torture could not...|$|R

40|$|Southern African {{countries}} have been constantly plagued by war and political struggles. In particular, when the war in Angola ended in 2002, people repatriated back to the country. Previous papers have not specifically included a perspective on how local people in eastern Angola accepted humanitarian aid, nor how it was incorporated into their daily livelihood strategies in this post-conflict situation. In the absence of this perspective, this study aimed to clarify the livelihood strategies of small-scale farmers called Mbunda following a prolonged war in Angola, focusing on how a humanitarian aid crop was utilised by the farmers. In eastern Angola, {{it is difficult to}} establish mutual aid relationships because people’s lives have become fluid. Social networks in post-conflict areas create vulnerable contexts for people, particularly those who rely solely on cassava for their food. The accelerated flow of people also contributes to the risk of a serious labour shortage.

40|$|Invited {{presentation}} to the ALNAP Working Group Meeting "Evaluating the Use of Research Methods in <b>Humanitarian</b> Contexts: Promoting <b>Good</b> Practice, Geneva, 1 - 2 April 2004 Self-settled refugee populations on the African continent generally constitute an ‘undocumented’ population {{in more than one}} way. Not only do they lack a legal status and residence permit, but there exists scarce documentation on their demographic characteristics. Both types of ‘undocumentedness’ carry important consequences with regard to the methods and strategies applied to the data collecting process. Undocumentedness equally affects the location and selection of respondents and informants. This paper delves into the theoretical considerations that accompanied my choice of methods as well as the practical strategies I applied to carry out the actual research among Congolese, Burundi and Rwandan refugees in Dar es Salaam in 2001 - 2. It also considers the ethical implications of dealing with refugees’ aspirations and expectations. Even as numerous efforts were invested into composing a representative sample and contextualising the findings there remains a need to reflect upon certain (perhaps unsolvable?) issues in researching ‘undocumented’ populations. status: publishe...|$|R
