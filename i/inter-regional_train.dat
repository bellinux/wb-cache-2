40|$|Theme 1 Since {{the late}} 1980 s, the entry {{barriers}} for new bus and railway companies have gradually been reduced in Sweden. In this paper {{the effects of}} these changes upon small businesses are analysed {{with the help of a}} couple of case study firms. Four parts of the transportation sector are considered: local and regional bus services, long-distance bus services, regional train services and <b>inter-regional</b> <b>train</b> services. Although offering different basic conditions for entry, new as well as old small businesses have often faced a common problem on each of these markets: having to compete with a giant former monopolist or oligopolists, or being dependent on some of its/their factors of production. Although several firms have been forced out of the markets, a number of them have managed to survive and grow. In this paper it is argued that there are a few key factors that govern a small firm’s success or failure. Institute of Transport and Logistics Studies. Faculty of Economics and Business.

5000|$|The town's first {{railway station}} opened in 1863 and was located {{a short walk}} from Rådhustorget, the City Hall Square. In the 1920's was Landskrona station the western {{terminal}} of three railway lines. To Eslöv, Kävlinge (from which some trains continued to Lund and Malmö) and to Billesholm. It's notable that during the 1860 to 1940 construction of the Swedish railway network, there wasn't build a railway to the nearby city of Helsingborg. The line to Billesholm was short-lived and closed before the 1960's. During the mid 1970's was the Swedish National Railways, SJ considering to close all local train service in the south. But along with other towns and cities in the former Malmöhus län, did Landskrona participated in forming a new local railway system, which got the very Scanian name Pågatåg. This new railway system, which opened in a minor scale in 1983, was {{the first of its kind}} in Sweden, outside the Stockholm area. [...] In connection with the construction of the Øresund Bridge, another train system was introduced, called the Øresundståg. They are <b>Inter-regional</b> <b>trains</b> as well as international ones, and are partly linking Denmark and Sweden together in the field of railways. For Landskrona this meant that there was a call for a new location of the station, in order to avoid both the terminal station type, as well as open up also for northbound traffic. After political discussions was it also decided to build a new dual track high speed railway between Helsingborg and Lund, as a part of a planned West Coast Railway between Copenhagen and Gothenborg. As Landskrona is located between Helsingborg and Lund, Landskrona became included in the planning for the new railway. But, as the new railway just [...] "touched" [...] the town's eastern end, there was a need for a new station in that area. The new station, located at what until the late 1990's, were agricultural areas, now delineates the clear boundary between town and countryside. The new station, which opened in January 2001, allowed for a greater range of train operations, compared to the old terminal for southbound trains only. Today, all local Pågatågen <b>trains</b> and <b>inter-regional</b> Øresundståg <b>trains</b> stop at the new station, which gives the new station a frequent weekday service of 4-6 trains per hour in each direction.|$|R

40|$|Many {{people use}} the train both as a daily means of {{transport}} {{as well as a}} working place to carry out activities such as reading or writing. There are, however, several important factors in this environment that will hamper good performance of such activities. Some of the main sources of disturbance, apart form other train passengers, are noise and vibrations generated from the train itself. Although there are standards available for evaluation of ride comfort in vehicles none of them consider the effects that vibrations have on particular passengers' activities. To address these issues, three different studies were conducted to investigate how low frequency lateral vibrations influence the passengers' ability to read and write onboard trains. The first study was conducted on three types of <b>Inter-Regional</b> <b>trains</b> during normal service and included both a questionnaire survey and vibration measurements. Two proceeding laboratory studies were conducted in a train mock-up where the perceived difficulty of reading and writing was evaluated for different frequencies and amplitudes. To model and clarify how vibrations influence the processes of reading and writing the fundamentals of Human Activity Theory was used as a framework in this thesis. In the field study about 80 % of the passengers were found to be reading {{at some point during the}} journey, 25 % were writing by hand, and 14 % worked with portable computers. The passengers applied a wide range of seated postures for their different activities. According to the standardised measurements, even the trains running on poor tracks showed acceptable levels of vibration. However, when the passengers performed a short written test, over 60 % reported to be disturbed or affected by vibrations and noise in the train. In the laboratory studies it was found that the difficulty in reading and writing is strongly influenced by both vibration frequency and acceleration amplitude. The vibration spectra of real trains were found to correspond well to the frequency characteristics of the rated difficulty. It was also observed that moderate levels of difficulty begin at fairly low vibration levels. Contextual parameters like sitting posture and type of activity also showed strong influence on how vibrations cause difficulty...|$|R
