40|$|About 7. 5 million {{adults in}} Germany cannot {{read and write}} {{properly}} despite attending school for several years. They {{are considered to be}} <b>functional</b> <b>illiterates.</b> Since the ability to read and write is crucial for being employed and socially accepted, we developed a literacy training to overcome these deficits. In this study, we investigate the structural changes induced by the training. A group of 20 <b>functional</b> <b>illiterates</b> and 20 adult normal readers participated in the study. Group differences as well as intervention-related changes in gray (voxel-based morphometry, VBM) and white matter (Tract-Based Spatial Statistics, TBSS, applied to fractional anisotropy, FA, obtained with diffusion tensor imaging, DTI) were assessed in <b>functional</b> <b>illiterates</b> and normal reading controls. VBM analyses revealed decreased gray matter intensities in <b>functional</b> <b>illiterates</b> compared to normal readers before training in several reading-related brain regions such as the superior temporal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and angular gyrus. Using TBSS, <b>functional</b> <b>illiterates</b> showed reduced FA values in the genu of the corpus callosum. After training, both the gray matter intensities and FA values increased in <b>functional</b> <b>illiterates</b> and were no longer statistically different from controls' pre-test data. Moreover, the increase was positively correlated with reading and writing skills. The findings suggest that poor literacy skills are associated with several structural abnormalities in reading-related brain areas. In addition, we showed that while literacy skills of <b>functional</b> <b>illiterates</b> improved after training, the structural differences to controls disappeared...|$|R
40|$|Background Event-related brain {{potentials}} (ERPs) {{were used}} to investigate training-related changes in fast visual word recognition of functionally illiterate adults. Analyses focused on the left-lateralized occipito-temporal N 170, which represents the earliest processing of visual word forms. Event-related brain potentials were recorded from 20 <b>functional</b> <b>illiterates</b> receiving intensive literacy training for adults, 10 <b>functional</b> <b>illiterates</b> not participating in the training and 14 regular readers while they read words, pseudowords or viewed symbol strings. Subjects were required to press a button whenever a stimulus was immediately repeated. Results Attending intensive literacy training was associated with improvements in reading and writing skills and with an increase of the word-related N 170 amplitude. For untrained <b>functional</b> <b>illiterates</b> and regular readers no changes in literacy skills or N 170 amplitude were observed. Conclusions Results {{of the present study}} suggest that the word-related N 170 can still be modulated in adulthood {{as a result of the}} improvements in literacy skills. ...|$|R

This inequality results in the presence of <b>functional</b> <b>illiterate</b> people, unable to use reading, writing and numeracy skills. We invited Brazilian people, including a group of functionally illiterate subjects, to interact with two types of receptionists differing in physical appearance (agent v mechanical robot) and in the sound of the voice (human like v mechanical). Results gathered during the interactions point out a preference for the agent, for the human-like voice and a more intense reaction to stimuli by illiterates. These results provide useful indications that should be considered when designing a receptionist robot, as well as insights on the effect of illiteracy in the interaction...|$|E

40|$|Formally, {{availability}} {{of education for}} children has increased around the world over the last decades. However, despite having a successful formal education career, adults can become <b>functional</b> <b>illiterates.</b> <b>Functional</b> illiteracy means that a person cannot use reading, writing and calculation skills for his/her own and the community’s development. Functional illiteracy has considerable negative effects not only on personal development, but also in economic and social terms. Although functional illiteracy has been highly publicized in mass media in the recent years, there is limited scientific knowledge about the people termed functional illiterates; definition, assessment and differential diagnoses with respect to related numerical and linguistic impairments are rarely studied and controversial. The first goal of our review is to give a comprehensive overview {{of the research on}} functional illiteracy by describing gaps in knowledge within the field and to outline and address the basic questions concerning who can be considered as functional illiterates: (1) Do they possess basic skills? (2) In which abilities do they have the largest deficits? (3) Are numerical and linguistic deficits related? (4) What is the fundamental reason for their difficulties? (5) Are there main differences between <b>functional</b> <b>illiterates,</b> illiterates and dyslexics? We will see that despite partial evidence, there is still much research needed to answer these questions. Secondly, we emphasize the timeliness for a new and more precise definition that results in uniform sampling, better diagnosis, conclusion and intervention. We propose the following working definition {{as the result of the}} review: functional illiteracy is the incapability to understand complex texts despite adequate schooling, age, language skills, elementary reading skills and IQ. These inabilities must also not be fully explained by sensory, domain-general cognitive, neurological or mental disorders. In sum, we suggest that functional illiteracy must be more thoroughly understood and assessed from a theoretical, empirical and diagnostic perspective...|$|R

40|$|It is {{estimated}} that 759 million individuals worldwide are illiterate, i. e. they cannot read or write properly. With 95 %, {{the majority of the}} illiterate population lives in developing countries.

50|$|Minimally Invasive Education {{in school}} asserts {{there are many}} ways to study and learn. It argues that {{learning}} is a process you do, not a process that is done to you. The experience of schools holding this approach shows that {{there are many ways}} to learn without the intervention of teaching, to say, without the intervention of a teacher being imperative. In the case of reading for instance in these schools some children learn from being read to, memorizing the stories and then ultimately reading them. Others learn from cereal boxes, others from games instructions, others from street signs. Some teach themselves letter sounds, others syllables, others whole words. They adduce that in their schools no one child has ever been forced, pushed, urged, cajoled, or bribed into learning how to read or write, and they have had no dyslexia. None of their graduates are real or <b>functional</b> <b>illiterates,</b> and no one who meets their older students could ever guess the age at which they first learned to read or write.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{analyze the}} scoring {{obtained}} by an instrument, which evaluates {{the ability to}} read and understand items in the health care setting, according to education and age. METHODS: The short version of the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults was administered to 312 healthy participants of different ages and years of schooling. The study was conducted between 2006 and 2007, in the city of São Paulo, Southeastern Brazil. The test includes actual materials such as pill bottles and appointment slips and measures reading comprehension, assessing {{the ability to read}} and correctly pronounce a list of words and understand both prose passages and numerical information. Pearson partial correlations and a multiple regression model were used to verify the association between its scores and education and age. RESULTS: The mean age of the sample was 47. 3 years(sd= 16. 8) and the mean education was 9. 7 years(sd= 5; range: 1 - 17). A total of 32. 4 % of the sample showed literacy/numeracy deficits, scoring in the inadequate and marginal functional health literacy ranges. Among the elderly (65 years or older) this rate increased to 51. 6 %. There was a positive correlation between schooling and scores (r= 0. 74; p< 0. 01) and a negative correlation between age and the scores (r=- 0. 259; p< 0. 01). The correlation between the scores and age was not significant when the effects of education were held constant (rp=- 0. 031, p= 0. 584). A significant association (B= 3. 877, Beta = 0. 733; p< 0. 001) was found between schooling and scores. Age was not a significant predictor in this model (B=- 0. 035, Beta=- 0. 22; p= 0. 584).

40|$|Comparative Medicine - OneHealth and Comparative Medicine Poster SessionHealth {{literacy}} entered {{health care}} discourse when the 2003 National Adult Literacy Survey revealed {{that nearly half}} the US adult population has serious deficiencies in reading & computational skills, with one in four Americans (40 - 44 million) being functionally <b>illiterate.</b> <b>Functional</b> literacy {{is the ability to}} read, write, speak and compute at levels of proficiency necessary to function on the job and in society, to achieve goals, and develop knowledge and potential. Findings from a recent NCI-funded study, “Learner Verification of Cervical Cancer Education with Mexican Immigrant Women” exemplify the impact of literacy and language on understanding disease and prevention. The study explored how Mexican immigrant women with less than 9 th grade education understand the content of cervical cancer education. Findings showed that English to Spanish translations often did not use the words preferred and understood by the women and that many women lacked basic anatomic information on which to build reproductive health knowledge. They knew the terms, but not the “arrangement” of the female reproductive system. Various imagined models of female organs existed and 70 % of women interviewed could not identify what or where the “cervix” was. Rather than shorter, simpler formats commonly recommended for low literacy learners, these women consistently expressed desire for more information and greater detail. In this study, inadequate knowledge of anatomy posed a barrier for understanding cervical cancer prevention. Adapting educational materials is an appropriate short-term intervention. But these women wanted and needed much more. Low literacy negatively impacts the quality of an individual's entire life, not just health. Examples of life tasks requiring literacy include reading a bus schedule; using an automatic teller machine; reading a medicine label; completing job applications, tax forms, and maps; and balancing a check book. Literacy helps provide the confidence to communicate with others to establish the social capital important for a productive life. Without skills and confidence, individuals can get lost, assume a passive role, retreat into silence, lose their entitlements and rights, and deny society the benefit of unrealized talents. Improving overall adult literacy is a more upstream, far-reaching approach than simply adapting health teaching, but requires collaboration...|$|R
