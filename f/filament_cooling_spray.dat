40|$|<b>Spray</b> water <b>cooling</b> {{is widely}} used in many {{industrial}} processes to control heat removal from a hot material surface. In order to control heat transfer rates and obtain desired surface temperature distributions, {{a deeper understanding of}} fundamental <b>spray</b> <b>cooling</b> dynamics and more accurate estimation of spray heat transfer rates is needed. In this thesis, a new technique combining experiment and computational modeling has been developed for measuring the steady-state heat transfer extracted locally by water sprays or air-mists impinging on the surface of a hot metallic sample. 	The experimental apparatus was developed by A. C. Hernandez B., H. Castillejos E, and F. A. Acosta Gat CINVESTAV, Mexico, and is designed to be able to employ <b>spray</b> water to <b>cool</b> the metallic sample accommodated inside a copper coil with an alternating current as induction heating goes on inside the sample. Control of total input power from the wall maintains each desired sample thermocouple temperature. A computational model developed using the commercial finite-element package COMSOL Mutiphysics uses a two-dimensional axisymmetric model of the electromagnetics and heat-conduction equations to balance the heat extracted from the sample surface by the boiling water droplets. Measurement of the RMS current flowing through the copper coil enables the model to estimate the heat extracted to the <b>cooling</b> <b>spray</b> by matching the sample thermocouple temperature measurement. Heat transfer coefficients and fluxes are quantified for <b>spray</b> <b>cooling</b> of a platinum sample at temperatures ranging from 100 - 1200 ???C, using typical air-mist nozzles and conditions relevant to steel continuous casting, and also compared with transient measurement results of <b>spray</b> <b>cooling</b> and Nozaki empirical correlation.

Ideally they must distribute the cooling water uniformly onto the fill and must produce small drops at minimal pressure head to maximise heat and mass transfer in the spray zone with minimal pumping power. Limited thermal performance characteristic data is found in literature for <b>cooling</b> tower <b>spray</b> zones, since it is virtually impossible to measure spray zone performance accurately. In this paper, the method used to model the performance of <b>cooling</b> tower <b>spray</b> zones and results obtained for a medium pressure swirl nozzle are presented.

The suitability of superimposing single nozzle flow distribution data to obtain the water distribution for a grid of equally spaced nozzles with variable nozzle spacing is investigated. Furthermore, a single nozzle simulation model is developed and used to model single spray nozzles. The single nozzle model and the superposition model are subsequently used to obtain initial drop conditions to model the spray zone using the commercial CFD package FLUENT®.

Reliability of electronic products lies on the thermal management and understanding of heat transfer mechanisms of the most commonly used thermal management schemes such as <b>spray</b> <b>cooling.</b> Many experiments have been done to understand the heat transfer mechanisms associated with <b>spray</b> <b>cooling.</b> However, most of them have relied on comprehensive <b>spray</b> <b>cooling</b> experiments where multiple physical variables are at play simultaneously. Furthermore, experiments with single streams of droplets {{have not been able to}} elucidate the effects of the onset of boiling (ONB) during the droplet impingement process. Therefore, efforts have been undertaken to consider the effects of using three droplet streams arranged in a triangulated fashion. The effects of using triangulated multiple droplet impingements on the suppression or enhancement of boiling on heated surfaces has been investigated. Moreover, the effects of using screen laminated on the suppression of ONB during the droplet impingement process has been studied in detail. The main goal of this project is to study the effects of multiple droplet impingement on the flat heater surface in the <b>spray</b> <b>cooling</b> with and without the use of metallic screen laminates. Single and triple droplet impingement experiments have been performed to understand the droplet behavior in <b>spray</b> <b>cooling</b> systems where multiple droplets simultaneously impact a heated surface. The experiments consisted of using a stainless steel screen laminate over a sample surface to observe the suppression or enhancement of pool boiling which tends to occur at the periphery of each droplet impingement zone. An infrared-based imaging technique was used to measure surface temperature during droplet impingement. The heat transfer performance has been evaluated in terms of heat flux, droplet frequency and volume flow rate. The results indicate that droplet stream spacing and the use of copper meshes can enhance surface cooling significantly. Specifically, droplet stream spacing of 1000 ?m with copper meshes with a 6 mm hole and gap of 0. 2 mm lead to enhanced surface cooling during the multiple droplet impingement process.
