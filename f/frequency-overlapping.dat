40|$|Abstract—The authors {{propose a}} novel <b>frequency-overlapping</b> multigroup scheme for a passive all-optical fast-frequency hopped code-division multiple-access (OFFH-CDMA) {{system based on}} fiber Bragg grating array (FBGA). In the {{conventional}} scheme, the users are assigned those codes constructed on the nonoverlapping frequency slots, and therefore the bandgaps between the adjacent gratings are wasted. To make a more efficient use of the optical spectrum, the proposed scheme divided the users into several groups, and assigned the codes, which interleaved to each other to the different groups. In addition to the higher utilization of the spectrum, the interleaved nature of the frequency allocations of different groups will make the groups less correlated and, hence, lower the multiple-access interference (MAI). The corresponding codeset and its constraints for this new scheme are also developed and analyzed. The performance of the system {{in terms of the}} correlation functions and bit error rate (BER) are given in both the conventional and the proposed schemes. The numerical results show that, with the multigroup scheme, performance is much improved compared to the conventional scheme.

40|$|In this paper, a {{new method}} for blind spatial signal {{filtering}} is proposed. It utilizes the selectivity {{property of the}} higherorder cyclostationary statistics exhibited by the signal of interest to accurately estimate its unknown steering vector, also {{in the presence of}} strong <b>frequency-overlapped</b> interfering signals, which would render the standard stationaritybased techniques ineffective. The method is useful when the desired signal cannot be accurately extracted by exploiting its second-order cyclostationarity properties, as proposed in [1]. The performance analysis, carried out by computer simulations in the case of QAM-modulated signals with partially overlapping bands, substantiates the effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{new method}} for blind minimum mean-square error (MMSE) spatio-temporal signal ﬁltering is {{proposed}}. To obtain a blind {{version of the}} MMSE ﬁlter, the proposed method utilizes the signal selectivity property of the higher order cyclostationary statistics (HOCS) exhibited by the signal of interest. An accurate estimate of the transfer function of the MMSE ﬁlter is obtained also {{in the presence of}} strong <b>frequency-overlapped</b> interfering signals, which would render standard stationarity-based techniques ineffective. The method is useful when the desired signal cannot be accurately extracted by exploiting its second-order cyclostationarity properties because they are too weak and/or they are shared by the interference and noise signals as well. The performance analysis, which is carried out by computer simulations in the case of quadrature amplitude modulated (QAM) -modulated signals with partially overlapping bands, substantiates the effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates noise {{enhancement}} {{factors of}} a zero-forcing detector and a decision feedback detector for synchronous Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) channels. It is first {{shown that the}} zero-forcing and decision feedback detectors can be implemented in a vector digital filter form, and the noise enhancement factors with the detectors can easily be calculated by using the vector digital filter form. This paper then applies the zero-forcing and decision feedback detectors to the signal detection of a <b>frequency-overlapped</b> multicarrier signaling (FOMS) system. The normalized noise enhancement factor, which is given {{as a product of}} the noise enhancement and bandwidth reduction factors, is shown to be smaller with the decision feedback detector than the zero-forcing detector. Results of computer simulations conducted to evaluate bit error rate (BER) performances with the two detectors are also shown together with the BER performance with a conventional channel-by-channel detector...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis study, {{focused on}} the {{laryngeal}} source level, introduces the concept of laryngeal vibratory mechanism. Human phonation {{is characterized by the}} use of four laryngeal mechanisms, labeled M 0 -M 3, as evidenced by the electroglottographic (EGG) study of the transition phenomena between mechanisms with a population of men and women, trained and untrained singers. Macroscopic and local descriptions of the EGG signal are analyzed during the production of glissandos and held notes with different mechanisms. The transition from one mechanism to another of higher rank is characterized by a jump in frequency, a reduction of EGG amplitude, and a change {{in the shape of the}} derivative of the EGG (which may correspond to a reduction of the vibratory mass). These characteristics are used to identify a transition between two mechanisms, in complement with acoustic spectrographic analyses. The pitches of transitions between the two main mechanisms M 1 and M 2 and the range of the <b>frequency-overlap</b> region are described in detail. The notion of vocal register is revisited in the light of these concepts of laryngeal mechanism. The literature on vocal registers is reviewed, and it is shown that the confusion often cited with respect to this notion may be related to the heterogeneity of the approaches and methods used to describe the phenomena and to the multiplicity of descriptors. Therefore, the terminology of the registers is organized depending on their relation to the four laryngeal vibratory mechanisms...|$|R
