5|$|As many {{symptoms}} {{of carbon monoxide}} poisoning also occur with many other types of poisonings and infections (such as the flu), the diagnosis is often difficult. A history of potential carbon monoxide exposure, such as being <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> residential fire, may suggest poisoning, but the diagnosis is confirmed by measuring the levels of carbon monoxide in the blood. This can be determined by measuring the amount of carboxyhemoglobin compared {{to the amount of}} hemoglobin in the blood.|$|E
5|$|Barotrauma, {{an example}} of dysbarism, is {{physical}} damage to body tissues caused by a difference in pressure between a gas space inside, or {{in contact with the}} body, and the surrounding gas or fluid. It typically occurs when the organism is <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> large change in ambient pressure, such as when a diver ascends or descends. When diving, the pressure differences which cause the barotrauma are changes in hydrostatic pressure.|$|E

5|$|Because sugars burn easily {{when exposed}} to flame, the {{handling}} of sugars risks dust explosion. The 2008 Georgia sugar refinery explosion, which killed 14 people and injured 40, and destroyed most of the refinery, {{was caused by the}} ignition of sugar dust. In its culinary use, sugar that is <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> heat source causes caramelization to take place. As the process occurs, volatile chemicals such as diacetyl are released, producing the characteristic caramel flavor.|$|E
5|$|Exposure {{is raised}} {{for people who}} live near thorium deposits, {{radioactive}} waste disposal sites, those who live near or work in uranium, phosphate, or tin processing factories, {{and for those who}} work in gas mantle production.

Despite Henry's initial successes, France and Spain made peace in 1544, leaving England <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> French invasion, backed by her allies in Scotland. In response, Henry issued an {{instruction}} to improve the country's defences, particularly along the south coast. Dartmouth Castle was reinforced by three new gun batteries, two {{either side of the}} gun tower, and another, Lamberd's Bulwarke, positioned in the south-east corner of the fortalice.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to obvious dangers such as rodenticides, insecticides, and herbicides, cats may be poisoned by many chemicals usually considered safe by their human guardians, because their livers are less effective at {{some forms of}} detoxification than those of many other animals, including humans and dogs. Some {{of the most common}} causes of poisoning in cats are antifreeze and rodent baits. Cats may be particularly sensitive to environmental pollutants. When a cat has a sudden or prolonged serious illness without any obvious cause, it has possibly been <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> toxin.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine the {{participation}} of a variety of variables in gambling behavior. Forty-five subjects were <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> experimental roulette game played for course extra-credit points. In Phase 1, subjects played a fair game (i. e., completely random outcomes) without any instructions regarding the programmed contingencies for 75 trials. During Phase 2, subjects were <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> adjusted game with payback percentages of either p =. 2, P =. 8, or continued at p = fair and instructions related to play. Lastly, during Phase 3 all subjects were <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> adjusted game with a payback percentage of. 2 and an option for escape. Results show that subjects <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> inaccurate rules regarding play took higher levels of risk, made larger bets, and chose the escape option later than subjects <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> accurate or no rules related to play. Although reinforcement density varied across subjects <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> the same rule condition, there was no significant effect of that manipulation on subsequent gambles...|$|R

5|$|Plants grown under UVB light {{are more}} {{resistant}} to insect herbivory compared with plants grown under filters that exclude the radiation. When tomato plants are <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> pulse of UVB radiation and then weakly wounded, PIs accumulate throughout the plant. By themselves, neither the radiation nor weak wounding is sufficient to induce systemic PI accumulation. Tomato cell cultures respond similarly, with systemin and UVB acting together to activate MAPKs. Short pulses of UVB also cause alkalisation of the culturing medium.|$|E
5|$|The Hideous Sun Demon (sometimes {{billed as}} The Sun Demon, {{or in the}} UK as Blood on His Lips) is a 1958 science-fiction horror film written, {{directed}} and produced by Robert Clarke, who also starred in the film. It also stars Patricia Manning, Nan Peterson, Patrick Whyte and Fred La Porta. The film focuses on a scientist (portrayed by Clarke) who is <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> radioactive isotope and soon finds out that it comes with horrifying consequences.|$|E
5|$|Unconscious {{self-regulation}} {{has been}} found to increase under psychological threat. For the effect to be one of unconscious self-regulation it too should increase under threat. Jones, Pelham, Mirenberg, and Hetts found that when people who were high in explicit self-esteem were <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> psychological threat, they showed exaggerated name-letter preferences. In contrast, low self-esteem participants showed evidence of the opposite tendency. Komori and Murata later replicated this response to threat with Japanese bilinguals who were asked to select preferred letters of the English alphabet.|$|E

Deusdedit had died shortly after Whitby, and as there were no other bishops in Britain whom Wilfrid {{considered}} to have been validly consecrated he travelled to Compiègne, to be consecrated by Agilbert, the Bishop of Paris. During his time in Gaul Wilfrid was <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> higher level of ceremony than that practised in Northumbria, one example of which is that he was carried to his consecration ceremony on a throne supported by nine bishops.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Schreiber {{remained}} at Los Alamos, {{where he became}} a group leader in the Weapon (W) Division. His first assignment was to ready bombs for the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific.

Slotin would die from radiation poisoning nine days later but his quick reaction saved the lives of Schreiber and the others in the room (see also: demon core). Schreiber became an exponent of remote handling of dangerous substances, and designed remote-control machines to perform such experiments with all personnel at a quarter-mile distance.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in order to assess the prevalence of use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) among pregnant women delivering a liveborn infant in the USA. A retrospective {{study was conducted}} using the automated databases of 15 health-care systems participating in the Mini-Sentinel program. Diagnosis and procedure codes were used to identify women ages 10 to 54 years delivering a liveborn infant between April 2001 and December 2013. A comparison group of age- and date-matched women without live births was identified. The frequency of use of SSRIs was identified from outpatient dispensing data. Among the 1, 895, 519 liveborn deliveries, 113, 689 women (6. 0 %) were <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> SSRI during pregnancy during the period 2001 - 2013; 5. 4 % were <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> SSRI during 2013. During the corresponding time period, 10. 5 % of the age- and date-matched cohort of women without live births was <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> SSRI, with 10. 1 % <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> SSRI during 2013. The most common agents dispensed during pregnancy were sertraline (n = 48, 678), fluoxetine (n = 28, 983), and citalopram (n = 20, 591). Among those women <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> SSRI during pregnancy, 53. 8 % had a diagnosis of depression and 37. 3 % had a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder during pregnancy or within 180 days prior to pregnancy. Our finding that 6 % of women with live births were prescribed SSRIs during pregnancy highlights the importance of understanding the differential effects of these medications and other therapeutic options on the developing fetus and on the pregnant women...|$|R
