5000|$|Cayman Islands - Same-sex {{marriage}} is not legal, {{but in a}} decision of the <b>Immigration</b> <b>Appeals</b> <b>Tribunal</b> issued on 7 July 2016, the court recognised the legal validity of a foreign same-sex marriage {{for the purpose of}} adding the same-sex spouse of a work permit holder as a dependent of the latter.

50|$|In July 2016, the <b>Immigration</b> <b>Appeals</b> <b>Tribunal</b> {{ruled in}} favour of a gay man who wished {{to be added to}} his spouse’s work permit as a dependent. The two men's {{application}} was made 14 months prior to the ruling and was rejected, they subsequently filed a lawsuit. A July 2016 ruling by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) had significant implications for the lawsuit. The ECHR found that a refusal to grant a residence permit to a same-sex couple in Italy on family grounds was unjustified discrimination. All same-sex couples now have immigration rights recognised, meaning same-sex couples can settle in the Cayman Islands without fear of {{discrimination on the basis of}} sexual orientation.|$|E
50|$|On 6 October 2016, the Legislative Assembly of the Cayman Islands {{voted against}} a {{proposal}} to hold a referendum on whether the territory should legalise same-sex marriage. The proposal was voted down 9-8. It was filed by MLA Anthony Eden after the <b>Immigration</b> <b>Appeals</b> <b>Tribunal</b> ruled to allow the same-sex partner of a work permit holder {{to remain in the}} Cayman Islands as a dependent on his partner’s permit. Premier Alden McLaughlin expressed his opposition to the referendum proposal. In the weeks prior to the 2017 elections, legal expert Dr Leo Raznovich invited same-sex couples on the island to challenge the implicit ban on same-sex marriage in Cayman law, arguing the lack of express prohibition in the Constitution and local legislation to same-sex marriage triggers sections 24 and 25 of the Constitution.|$|E
