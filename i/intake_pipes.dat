25|$|Preliminary {{underwater}} {{inspections of}} the Norman Atlantic {{revealed that the}} water <b>intake</b> <b>pipes</b> of the fire sprinkler system were clogged with mussels; additional inspections are necessary to determine if this blockage contributed to the fire's spreading. Although the voyage data recorder (black box) has been recovered, still by mid-March no data have been extracted, apparently because {{the heat of the}} fire caused the plastic to melt onto the hard disk. Recordings of the Voyage data recorder published on 7 October 2015, say that the fire sprinkler system wasn't working correctly and instead of spraying water there was smoke coming from the system. The investigations also state that there was a truck that had the engine working. Smoke was coming from the truck prior to the fire.|$|E
25|$|In March 2013, Saga University {{with various}} Japanese {{industries}} completed {{the installation of}} a new OTEC plant. Okinawa Prefecture announced {{the start of the}} OTEC operation testing at Kume Island on April 15, 2013. The main aim is to prove the validity of computer models and demonstrate OTEC to the public. The testing and research will be conducted with the support of Saga University until the end of FY 2016. IHI Plant Construction Co. Ltd, Yokogawa Electric Corporation, and Xenesys Inc were entrusted with constructing the 100 kilowatt class plant within the grounds of the Okinawa Prefecture Deep Sea Water Research Center. The location was specifically chosen in order to utilize existing deep seawater and surface seawater <b>intake</b> <b>pipes</b> installed for the research center in 2000. The pipe is used for the intake of deep sea water for research, fishery, and agricultural use.|$|E
500|$|Two years later, in 2009, a Finding Of No Significant Impact by the Federal Transit Administration {{found that}} a {{proposed}} entrance at {{the northeast corner of}} Second Avenue and 72nd Street was unfeasible, as was the proposed single sidewalk elevator at the southeast corner. The northeast-corner entrance, within the 305 East 72nd Street apartment building, would have encroached into a portion of CVS Pharmacy's ground-floor retail space as well as the apartment building's basement, which contained its laundry room and several of its utility <b>intake</b> <b>pipes.</b> Building the northeast-corner entrance would have forced the owners of 305 East 72nd Street to move their laundry room and utilities into the retail space occupied by CVS, so plans for the northeast-corner entrance were canceled. The site for the sidewalk elevator on the southeast corner turned out to be located close to a high-pressure steam main that was [...] in diameter. After a 2007 steam main explosion in Midtown, utility provider Consolidated Edison changed its guidelines for clearance around high-pressure mains, which meant that the elevator was now too close to the main. Thus, the plan was revised to place the elevator inside a building. Of the three alternatives presented for combining the two entrances, the MTA chose an alternative in which there would be five elevators inside a building at the southeast corner of Second Avenue and 72nd Street. This required the demolition of 300 East 72nd Street so that a new building for the five elevators could be built.|$|E
40|$|It has well {{been known}} long since that the breating {{capacity}} and the fuel supplied {{state of the}} internal combustion engines are largely governed by an <b>intake</b> <b>pipe</b> system.

A formula to predict the effective diameter for the geometry of the <b>intake</b> <b>pipe</b> {{as a function of}} cylinder bore, stroke, engine speed, pipe length, ambient temperature and aerodynamic losses, is created. In this analysis, the kinetic energy of a charge column in the period of a filling cylinder and the maximum kinetic energy are taken into consideration. A comparison between the results of the novel suggested formula and the actual published work to determine the <b>intake</b> <b>pipe</b> diameter is done for different engines.

Tests with interchanged cylinders showed that the excessive temperatures of cylinder 10 were inherent in the cylinder location and were not due to the mechanical condition of the cylinder assembly. Throttling the charge in the <b>intake</b> <b>pipe</b> is a simpler method than coolant injection into the <b>intake</b> <b>pipe</b> particularly when only one cylinder is considerably hotter than any other. Coolant injection into the individual cylinders is a more efficient method than throttling in the <b>intake</b> <b>pipe</b> and is warranted when several cylinders are to be cooled or when parts of the complex equipment required are already available...|$|R

40|$|During the {{gasoline}} engine start process, both fuel quantity and fuel film parameter change, fuel film dynamics in <b>intake</b> <b>pipe</b> is not balance, {{which makes the}} fuel quantity from nozzle and fuel quantity into the cylinder not be equaled. In order to control the air fuel ratio accurately in gasoline engine start process, fuel film model of <b>intake</b> <b>pipe</b> need to be established accurately.

Based on Aquino fuel film model, a new dynamic fuel film model is presented, in which the change of intake parameters is consider. The air fuel ratio variable by presented model and by Aquino model is simulated by using SIMULINK in gasoline engine start condition, and the simulated result is compared with experiment data.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present some {{simulation}} results by means of the quasi- 3 D method of the compressible unsteady flow of a viscous fluid through pipes and manifolds of internal combustion engines (ICE).

Apart from some theoretical basics, the quasi- 3 D method is applied (as an example) to a one-cylinder research diesel engine.

5000|$|... #Caption: Working {{mechanism}} of a valveless pulse jet engine. The basic {{idea is that}} the column of air in the long exhaust pipe functions like the piston of a reciprocating engine. From another point of view, the engine is an acoustic resonator internally excited by resonating combustions in the chamber. The chamber acts as a pressure antinode which is compressed by the returning wave. The <b>intake</b> <b>pipe</b> acts as a kinematic antinode which sucks and exhausts gas. Note the longer length of the exhaust pipe—this is important as it prevents oxygen from entering the wrong way and igniting the system the wrong way. It does this because when the pulse ignites, there is still some exhaust gas in the exhaust pipe. That is sucked in before any additional oxygen is sucked in. Of course, the air <b>intake</b> <b>pipe</b> has already supplied the oxygen by that point and the pulse reignites.|$|R
