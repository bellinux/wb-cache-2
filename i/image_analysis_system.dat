For HER 2 / neu testing there is not standart assay that has been agreed on. Silver enhanced in situ hybridization is a cantitative and highly reproducible assay. Immunohistochemistry is a cheap and easy assay that has disadvantage of being less reproducible. Recently developed pathologist assisted computerized image analysis systems decrease the ratio of subjectivity due to manual evaluation, enable tele-consultation and make it easy to evaluate tumor morphology and markers. Our aim is to investigate the consistency of manual and computerized interpretation of the results of immunohistochemistry and silver enhanced in situ hybridization. Material and Method: Immunohistochemisty and silver enhanced in situ hybridization of 73 invasive breast carcinoma results were evaluated manually to determine HER 2 /neu status. Later, silver enhanced in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry results were reevaluated with Ventana <b>Image</b> <b>Analysis</b> <b>System.</b> Afterwards correlation of both methods with <b>image</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>system</b> and manuel interpretation were calculated.

The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a set of simple experiments for evaluating the accuracy of fine root measurements obtained using <b>image</b> <b>analysis.</b> Using the <b>system</b> RHIZO (trademark of Regent Instruments, Quebec), we tested the accuracy of (i) length measurements made over a range of root lengths per unit area, (ii) average diameter measurements and length per diameter distributions in string, wire, and fine root samples of varying diameter, and (iii) diameter measurements on short segments of diagonally oriented objects. Our results suggest that preliminary testing of <b>image</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>systems</b> is absolutely necessary for producing reliable root measurements. Total length was accurately determined for typically encountered length per unit areas of 5 %. It is therefore recommended that users of <b>image</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>systems</b> determine this maximum length per unit area for accurate determinations of total root length. In samples that contained different string diameters, the total sample length and average string diameter could accurately be measured. However, the length per diameter class was underestimated by > 20 % when the string diameter was less than one pixel smaller than the upper limit of the diameter class. Adjustment of diameter intervals and increasing the scanner resolution are required to reduce this underestimation. Both the length and the angle of the short segments analyzed were found to influence diameter measurements.

Capitalizing this technology, ample cellular information can be extracted from the high content cellular images. In this study, an automated, reliable and quantitative cellular <b>image</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>system</b> developed in house has been employed to quantify the toxic responses of human H 4 neuroglioma cells exposed to metal oxide nanoparticles. This system has been {{proved to be an}} essential tool in our study. Results The cellular images of H 4 neuroglioma cells exposed to different concentrations of CuO nanoparticles were sampled using IN Cell Analyzer 1000. A fully automated cellular <b>image</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>system</b> has been developed to perform the image analysis for cell viability. A multiple adaptive thresholding method was used to classify the pixels of the nuclei image into three classes: bright nuclei, dark nuclei, and background. During the development of our image analysis methodology, we have achieved the followings: (1) The Gaussian filtering with proper scale has been applied to the cellular images for generation of a local intensity maximum inside each nucleus; (2) a novel local intensity maxima detection method based on the gradient vector field has been established; and (3) a statistical model based splitting method was proposed to overcome the under segmentation problem. Computational results indicate that 95. 9 % nuclei can be detected and segmented correctly by the proposed <b>image</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>system.</b> Conclusion The proposed automated <b>image</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>system</b> can effectively segment the images of human H 4 neuroglioma cells exposed to CuO nanoparticles.
