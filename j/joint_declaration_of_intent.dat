50|$|Iraq and Iran {{formed a}} joint {{commission}} {{to mark the}} boundary between the two countries. They set up headquarters in all over the border. The commission ended marking the border on 26 December 1975 with the signing <b>of</b> a <b>joint</b> <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>intents.</b> Iran pulled back all of its soldiers from Iraq and sealed the borders, after stopping the support of the Kurds, suddenly, without any declaration. Iran also requested the CIA and the Mossad to end the military support of the Kurdish rebels. Most of the people thought that after the end of international support, the Iraqi government would negotiate with the Kurds, but the Vice-Chairman of Revolutionary Command Council, Saddam Hussein, launched an aggressive campaign against the rebels to end them forever. Mohammed Reza Pahlavi interfered and succeeded in establishing a cease fire, but on 1 April, the government relaunched the campaign. After many battles, the Iraqi Armed Forces finally defeated the rebels and ended the rebellion. More than 100,000 Kurdish refugees fled to Iran and Turkey with their leader, Mustafa al-Barzani, only to come back with another much more violent rebellion in 1978.|$|R

50|$|Canada {{established}} its {{diplomatic relations}} with South Africa in 1939, along with other nations, due to the outbreak of World War II. Canada actively encouraged the end of Apartheid in South Africa and the countries have had normal relations since then. The Constitution of South Africa was, in part, inspired by the Constitution of Canada, particularly the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Former South African President Nelson Mandela made an official state visit to Canada in September 1998 and spoke at the Human Rights Monument in Ottawa. Mandela was made an honorary Canadian citizen, during his second visit to Canada. A 2003 visit by President Thabo Mbeki in November 2003, ended with {{the signing of the}} <b>Joint</b> <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Intent</b> to strengthen relations between the two countries.|$|E
40|$|For over {{a decade}} it has been obvious that the entry of Britain into the EEC {{would be likely to}} call for {{adjustments}} in the trading patterns of all her Commonwealth partners, but only comparatively recently have the lines heen clearly drawn for the period of intense negotiations which will shape the future trading relations of developing Commonwealth countries with the EEC. In a <b>Joint</b> <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Intent</b> relating to the independent Commonwealth countries in Asia, the signatories to the Treaty of Enlargement declared their readiness, from the date of accession of the new member states to the EEC, to examine with the above countries in Asia such problems as might arise in the field of trade, with a view to seeking appropriate solutions. In this paper, the trends and patterns of trade of the Asian Commonwealth countries, India, Bangladesh, Singapore, Malaysia and Sri Lanka, are examined, and then the different treaties and trade agreements which will determine the implications of the EEC enlargement. The impact of the harmonisation of British commercial policy with the EEC is discussed in general, and the specific problems of each country described. Finally some alternative approaches to the solution of the problems arising from EEC enlargement are suggested, and the implications for development assistance are described...|$|E

40|$|As trading through {{advertisements}} increases, {{for example}} via advertisement {{websites such as}} Blocket, trading and contracting between individuals also increases. The contract law is the applicable legislation when individuals are trading between one another, {{because of the fact}} that individuals are to be considered equal against each another, and no consumer protection provisions are applicable. The contract law is not compelling, and general principles of contract law are therefore frequently applied within the legal area of contract law. Consistent <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> <b>intent</b> shall have been delivered from both parties for a binding agreement to have been concluded. The <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>intent,</b> for example tender and acceptance are examples of a will to legally act. Other than tender and acceptance, the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>intent</b> is usually difficult to establish and determine. In the event of the commencement of a negotiation stage between the parties, the <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> <b>intent</b> are not deemed to be binding, but rather binding in the sense of a moral attachment for the parties. To determine whether or not a binding agreement has been concluded between the parties, an interpretation is conducted with regard to either the underlying will <b>of</b> the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>intent,</b> or the wording <b>of</b> the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>intent</b> or to the receiver’s trust and interpretation of the will of the counterpart. Part may assert that the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>intent</b> is invalid based either on incorrect assumptions, statement errors or one parties passivity. The deemed sanctions are either; invalid <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>intent</b> or damage, or a combination of both consequences. The decision to sentence damage depends on bad faith or disloyal behavior of one party...|$|R
