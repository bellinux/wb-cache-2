40|$|The core {{business}} {{of real estate}} developers is performance long term developer contracts (directly or by subcontractors), that include constructing and selling residential and non-residential real estates. The characteristic feature of such contracts is the construction of properties that are generally financed by the principal over the whole project, by way of contractually agreed advances, and then – after the investment process has been completed – the ownership right is transferred to the buyer. Due to no unequivocal regulations in scope of revenue recognition resulting from property development contracts until 31 December 2008 some developers recognised revenues on developer contracts in accordance with IAS 18 “Revenue " some used the method of revenues and expenses percentage-of-completion in accordance with IAS 11 “Construction Contracts”. The immediate aim {{of this paper is}} a comparative analysis of Polish and international rules adopted by property development companies when recognising revenue and outcome of development contracts and a presentation of the effect that <b>IFRIC</b> <b>Interpretation</b> 15 „Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate ” has on the reporting of such companies...|$|E

50|$|The Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) {{has issued}} 'Australian {{equivalents}} to IFRS' (A-IFRS), numbering IFRS standards as AASB 1-8 and IAS standards as AASB 101-141. Australian equivalents to SIC and <b>IFRIC</b> <b>Interpretations</b> {{have also been}} issued, along {{with a number of}} 'domestic' standards and interpretations. These pronouncements replaced previous Australian generally accepted accounting principles with effect from annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 (i.e. 30 June 2006 was the first report prepared under IFRS-equivalent standards for June year ends). To this end, Australia, along with Europe and a few other countries, was one of the initial adopters of IFRS for domestic purposes (in the developed world). It must be acknowledged, however, that IFRS and primarily IAS have been part and parcel of accounting standard package in the developing world for many years since the relevant accounting bodies were more open to adoption of international standards for many reasons including that of capability.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the views and {{challenges}} from a range of accounting professionals, regulators and preparers with the introduction of a standardised approach to accounting for customer loyalty programmes (CLPs). It aims to highlight the ambiguities of the classification of commercial transactions, particularly the nature and timing of revenue recognition. Design/methodology/approach: Comment letters in response to the exposure draft D 20 CLPs are analysed together with an exposition of the effect of International Financial Reporting <b>Interpretations</b> Committee (<b>IFRIC)</b> 13 on an early adopter, Qantas airlines. Findings: Despite limited support for the consensus view advocated in D 20, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has upheld the deferred revenue approach consistent with the anticipated outcome of the IASB and Financial Accounting Standards Board revenue recognition project. Research limitations/implications: The paper analyses the characteristics and views of lobbyists using the IFRIC process. The use of other discourse methodologies may present issues of power within this process. Practical implications: The paper highlights how the implementation of <b>IFRIC</b> <b>interpretations</b> has the potential to alter reported financial results. Originality/value: The paper highlights the lobbying process and interpretation process at an international level. It also illustrates how companies can engage accounting interpretations to manage earnings, particularly in times of economic challenge...|$|R

40|$|The {{reform of}} {{international}} accounting standards, {{as a consequence}} of the process of harmonization of European accounting systems, involves significant changes to the financial instruments that affect all types of enterprises. Both the equity and liabilities of cooperatives, added to the impact of their very definition, should be considered in the light of the specific characteristics of their application in participating companies. An important debate arose when share capital was first considered as an instrument of debt in IAS 32, which was developed in the <b>IFRIC</b> 2 <b>interpretation,</b> although this was later questioned in the draft of amendments to IAS 32 by the IASB. Reform in Spain seems to ignore this controversy. The aim of this article is to provide a critical yet constructive approach with alternative proposals for the classification and accounting of share capital in cooperatives, reviewing opinions that go against the initial proposals of international standards and the Spanish solution.

40|$|The {{number of}} studies on IFRIC 15 is very limited. The {{available}} studies have either been conducted before the introduction of IFRIC 15 or {{at an early stage}} of the implementation. This study examines IFRIC 15 s practice from a longer perspective. The {{purpose of this study is}} to explain the effect that the <b>interpretation</b> <b>IFRIC</b> 15 has had on accounting objectives and qualitative characteristics of the revenue recognition of Swedish construction companies. The study will also analyze whether the construction companies has changed their perception of IFRIC 15 after applying it form a longer time perspective. Data were collected through interviews with the companies JM, NCC, PEAB and Skanska, as well as from the annual report of the companies.   The result shows that all construction companies in this study have been obliged to apply IAS 18. The change in accounting standards has led to a change in accounting method from the percentage of completion to completion method of revenue recognition of certain types of projects. The change of accounting method in the application of IFRIC 15 has an effect on the qualitative characteristics and accounting objectives, as the companies largely apply the realization concept and the prudence concept. The application of IFRIC 15 has also had different effects on the qualitative characteristics of the companies' revenue recognition. The consequence of this is that three of the studied companies believe that the financial statements don’t give a true and fair view of the financial performance and position of the company, which has led to an establishment of a segment reporting. While one of the companies believes that IFRIC 15 reflects the business well. Study results also indicate that companies are still critical of IFRIC 15...|$|R
40|$|This article evaluates Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) {{accounting}} {{practice and the}} related financial accounting and reporting requirements. Governments across the world are seeking to access private finance to improve public infrastructure. Accounting for PPPs has encountered many difficulties, {{one of which is}} the practice by which PPPs are not accounted for as fixed assets on the balance sheet of either the public sector client or the private sector operator. Accounting for PPPs has grown in importance at a time of transition from national Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (GAAP) to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Under UK GAAP, both client and operator accounting adopt the reasoning – familiar from leasing standards – of the allocation of risks and rewards between the parties to determine the party which should recognize the fixed asset on its balance sheet. The gap in IFRS with regard to operator accounting has been filled by the <b>interpretation</b> <b>IFRIC</b> 12 on service concession agreements: this moves the reasoning from risks and rewards to control, familiar from consolidation standards. The UK Treasury and the International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board (IPSASB) have required/proposed the adoption of the mirror-image treatment of IFRIC 12. In most, but not all, cases, control will be assessed to rest with the client, which will recognize property, plant and equipment, and not with the operator, which will recognize either a financial asset or an intangible asset on the basis of an assessment of which party bears the majority of risks and rewards. Under both UK GAAP and IFRS, accounting policy choices are strongly influenced by, for the client, governmental control frameworks, and for the operator, by the implications for the profile of distributable profits and for taxation. An important public policy issue is that the national accounts, which for European Union member states must comply with European System of Accounts 1995, will remain on a risks and rewards basis. It is these numbers that will be used in assessments of macro-fiscal policy and fiscal risks, notwithstanding that the Eurostat version of risks and rewards is even more open to manipulation than were the national financial reporting standards...|$|R
