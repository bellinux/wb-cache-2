2500|$|Smith's Shaft was [...] {{into the}} {{footwall}} at the 90Fathom Level, {{so rather than}} extend it any deeper a new shaft was sunk from that level. This was an <b>inclined</b> <b>shaft</b> which followed the dip of the vein. It was sunk in 1910 from a point {{just north of the}} cross-cut at the bottom of Smith's Shaft and was known as the Skip Shaft. It was designed purely for haulage, although a ladderway was put in at the side. The skip was a large steel container with small wheels running on wooden guides. It was lowered to a chute below a working level and wagons of ore were tipped into it. It was then brought up to the 90Fathom Level, tipped up and the ore in it dropped into other wagons to be taken along the cross-cut to Smith's Shaft. The 105Fathom Level was developed from the Skip Shaft in 1911, and in 191718 the shaft was deepened to the 120Fathom Level. It worked well, {{but there was no way}} to get horses down to the lower levels, so tramming had to be done by hand. So in 1916 a new cage shaft, later to be known as Murray's Shaft, was begun by extending a sump from the 90Fathom Level, at a point [...] south of the cross-cut from Smith's Shaft. This was another <b>inclined</b> <b>shaft,</b> but it was designed for winding cages so wagons, men and horses could all travel up and down it. However work ceased in 1918 while it was still [...] short of the 120Fathom Level and no further work was done on it before the company went into liquidation in 1920.|$|E
2500|$|As the North Ore Shoot {{was growing}} richer with depth, work began in 1943 on the North Shaft, another <b>inclined</b> <b>shaft</b> for winding cages, [...] north {{from the bottom}} of Murray's Shaft. It was while this shaft was being sunk that shales from the Skiddaw Group of rocks were first {{encountered}} at about [...] below the Lucy Tongue Level. Soon afterwards shale also appeared in the 214Fathom north sublevel. The fault continued in these rocks but it contained no ore. Work on the shaft was stopped and the 217Fathom Level was developed to draw ore from the rich stopes just above the shale. A short, rich section of ore south of the shale was followed down to the 237Fathom Level, the lowest level in the mine, roughly 100m below sea level.|$|E
2500|$|The Lochnagar mine {{consisted}} of two chambers with a shared access tunnel (see map). The shaft was sunk in the communication trench called [...] "Lochnagar Street". After the Black Watch had arrived at La Boissselle {{at the end of}} July 1915, many existing Allied fortifications, originally dug by the French, had been given Scotland-related names. The Lochnagar mine probably had the first deep incline shaft, which sloped [...] to a depth of about [...] – [...] It was begun [...] behind the British front line and [...] away from the German front line. Starting from the <b>inclined</b> <b>shaft,</b> about [...] below ground, a gallery was driven towards the German lines. For silence, the tunnellers used bayonets with spliced handles and worked barefoot on a floor covered with sandbags. Flints were carefully prised out of the chalk and laid on the floor; if the bayonet was manipulated two-handed, an assistant caught the dislodged material. Spoil was placed in sandbags and passed hand-by-hand, along a row of miners sitting on the floor and stored {{along the side of the}} tunnel, later to be used to tamp the charge.|$|E
50|$|The mine itself {{consisted}} of several {{vertical and horizontal}} shafts, of which four vertical <b>shafts,</b> five <b>inclined</b> <b>shafts,</b> and ten horizontal adits remain. Tailings piles appear in several places, with quantities of machinery scattered about the site.|$|R

50|$|The iron {{may have}} been {{deposited}} by volcanic exhalation, perhaps {{in the presence of}} microorganisms. Gold ore mineralization is most intense in the Main Ledge, at the surface, and the 9 Ledge, at the 3200 level (feet below the <b>Incline</b> <b>Shaft,</b> at 1594 m above sea level).|$|R

It was considered wise not to uncover any portion of the glacier spur, but to construct an <b>inclined</b> <b>shaft</b> down to its wall-like end and from this tunnel into the great mass. Immediately the leading ice company of the neighboring town contracted with me for all the ice I could furnish, and the flood-gates of affluence began slowly to rise.|$|E

50|$|The Champion property, {{located in}} 1851 as the New Years, was not opened {{as early as}} the {{adjoining}} Providence mine and in 1888 the <b>inclined</b> <b>shaft</b> had reached a depth of only 300' (180’ vertical) and only 350’ of drifts had been driven. In 1892 a consolidation with the adjoining Merrified and 8 other claims had been effected and the development work consisted of a 3000’ drain tunnel driven from Wolf Creek on the vein and intersecting the shaft at a depth of 600'; an <b>inclined</b> <b>shaft</b> on the vein 1000’ in depth and the ten levels had reached a maximum length of 1000’ north of the shaft. Although compelled to suspend operations at intervals during the period from 1892 to 1902, owing to the Providence-Champion legal war, the Champion shaft had been sunk to a depth of 2400’ on the vein and a new shaft on the Merrifield vein had reached a depth of 900 feet.|$|E
50|$|The tjasker (Frisian: jasker, German: Fluttermühle) is a {{small type}} of {{windmill}} used solely for drainage purposes. It is distinctive for its simple construction, featuring only a single <b>inclined</b> <b>shaft</b> that carries the sails on one end and an Archimedes' screw on the other, in this way avoiding the need for any gearing. The tjasker {{is commonly known as}} a typical Frisian windmill though it is also found in other Dutch provinces and in north Germany.|$|E

The typical 2nd and 3rd Dynasty mastabas was the 'stairway mastaba', the tomb chamber of which sank deeper than before and {{was connected to the}} top with an <b>inclined</b> <b>shaft</b> and stairs.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mine was}} {{discovered}} in 1907 when attention was focused there by {{the discovery of a}} quartz vein in rocks that closely resembled those in the town of Cobalt further north, which was undergoing a silver rush at the time. Development consisted of small open pits and sinking of a [...] <b>inclined</b> <b>shaft</b> along the quartz vein. At least five small drifts were created off the shaft at the , [...] and [...] levels. Small shipments of sulfide ore, containing copper and lead with some gold and silver values, were made to a smelter.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{drilling}} in other materials where {{the aim is}} to create a hole for some purpose, often the case of drilling or coring is to get an understanding of the ground/lithology. This may be done for prospecting to identify and quantify an ore body for mining, or to determining the type of foundations needed for a building or raised structure, or for underground structures, including tunnels and deep basements where an understanding of the ground is vital to determining how to excavate and the support philosophy. Drilling is also used in vertical and <b>inclined</b> <b>shaft</b> construction.|$|E
50|$|In {{the middle}} of the 19th century, the many {{individual}} pits transferred to larger mine complexes with central shafts, at which point the sinking of <b>inclined</b> <b>shafts</b> and the mixing of layout and equipment with the workings was abandoned entirely.

During the 70s several alternatives were studied for deepening of the mine and Level 2 was opened and extraction was carried out through an <b>inclined</b> <b>shaft</b> that began operation in 1982.
