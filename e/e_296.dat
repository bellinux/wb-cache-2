40|$|The {{intrinsic}} {{activity of}} coagulation factor VIIa (FVIIa) {{is dependent on}} Ca 2 + binding to a loop (residues 210 – 220) in the protease domain. Structural analysis revealed that Ca 2 + may enhance the activity by attenuating electrostatic repulsion of Glu 296 and/or by facilitating interactions between the loop and Lys 161 in the N-terminal tail. In support of the first mechanism, the mutations <b>E</b> <b>296</b> V and D 212 N resulted in similar, about 2 -fold, enhancements of the amidolytic activity. Moreover, mutation of the Lys 161 -interactive residue Asp 217 or Asp 219 to Ala reduced the amidolytic activity by 40 – 50 %, whereas the K 161 A mutation resulted in 80 % reduction. Hence one of these Asp residues in the Ca 2 +-binding loop appears to suffice for some residual interaction with Lys 161, whereas the more severe effect upon replacement of Lys 161 is due to abrogation of the interaction with the N-terminal tail. However, Ca 2 + attenuation of the repulsion between Asp 212 and Glu 296 keeps the activity above that of apoFVIIa. Altogether, our data suggest that repulsion involving Asp 212 in the Ca 2 +-binding loop suppresses FVIIa activity and that optimal activity requires a favorable interaction between the Ca 2 +-binding loop and the N-terminal tail. Crystal structures of tissue factor-bound FVIIaD 212 N and FVIIaV 158 D/E 296 V/M 298 Q revealed altered hydrogen bond networks, resembling those in factor Xa and thrombin, after introduction of the D 212 N and <b>E</b> <b>296</b> V mutations plausibly responsible for tethering the N-terminal tail to the activation domain. The charge repulsion between the Ca 2 +-binding loop and the activation domain appeared to be either relieved by charge removal and new hydrogen bonds (D 212 N) or abolished (<b>E</b> <b>296</b> V). We propose that Ca 2 + stimulates the intrinsic FVIIa activity {{by a combination of}} charge neutralization and loop stabilization...|$|E

40|$|The {{missense}} mutation Lys- 296 [...] >Glu (K <b>296</b> <b>E)</b> in the rhodopsin gene produces an opsin with no chromophore binding site and therefore is not activated by light. Nevertheless, the mutant opsin constitutively activates transducin in vitro and causes photoreceptor degeneration in vivo, possibly by continuously activating the phototransduction cascade, analogous to constant exposure to environmental light. We studied the K <b>296</b> <b>E</b> mutation in eight lines of transgenic mice.

Light-independent activation of transducin was demonstrated only after the removal of arrestin and dephosphorylation of K <b>296</b> <b>E</b> opsin.

In vitro studies have shown that both mutations result in constitutive activation of the protein, suggesting that the activated state of the receptor may be responsible for retinal degeneration in patients with these mutations. Previous work has highlighted the potential of retinylamine analogs as active-site directed inactivators of constitutively active mutants of rhodopsin with the idea that these or related compounds might be used therapeutically for cases of ADRP involving mutations of the active-site Lys. Unfortunately, however, amine derivatives of 11 -cis-retinal, although highly effective against a K 296 G mutant of rhodopsin, were without affect on the two naturally occurring ADRP mutants, presumably because of the greater steric bulk of Glu and Met side chains in comparison to Gly. For this reason we synthesized a retinylamine analog one carbon shorter than the parent 11 -cis-retinal and show that this compound is indeed an effective inhibitor of both the K <b>296</b> <b>E</b> and K <b>296</b> M mutants.

The most pronounced changes in the metal site were caused by replacement of the coordinating residues, Asp- 63 and His- 249, and the non-coordinating residue Lys- 296, which is located in the hinge region of the iron-binding cleft. The EPR spectral changes from replacement of other non-coordinating residues were more subtle, indicating small changes in Fe 3 + coordination to the protein. The EPR spectrum of variant G 65 R suggests that it adopts two distinct conformations in solution, one in which the two domains forming the iron-binding cleft are closed and one in which they are open; in the latter instance Asp- 63 is no longer coordinated to the Fe 3 +. Chloride-binding studies on hTf/ 2 N, K 206 Q, H 207 <b>E,</b> K <b>296</b> Q and K <b>296</b> <b>E</b> showed similar binding isotherms, indicating that none of the hinge region residues replaced, i. e.

To promote formation of the monomeric form of the enzyme, we changed the residues involved in formation of two salt bridges formed between the residues Glu 206 of the one polypeptide and Lys 296 of the other polypeptide. The mutant enzymes formed inactive precipitates when cells were grown at 37 °C, but remained soluble and active when cells were grown at 25 °C. The salt bridges were not needed for activity, because the mutant enzymes in which one of the residues was converted to an alanine (E 206 A or K 296 A) retained almost full activity.

40|$|UnrestrictedThrough the {{experiments}} {{described in this}} thesis, I strived to obtain a better understanding the function of rhodopsin in retinal degeneration and light adaptation. Over 100 rhodopsin mutation alleles {{have been associated with}} autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP), a blindness disorder that affects one in 3000 people globally. These mutations appear to cause photoreceptor cell death through diverse molecular mechanisms. We show that Lys 296 Glu (K <b>296</b> <b>E),</b> a rhodopsin mutation associated with ADRP, forms a stable complex with arrestin that is toxic to mouse rod photoreceptors. This cell death pathway appears to be conserved from flies to mammals. Accumulation of stable rhodopsin/arrestin complexes in the inner segment may be an important mechanism for triggering cell death in the mammalian photoreceptor cells. Abnormal turnover of rhodopsin mutants could also underlie a mechanism leading to cell death. In order to investigate rhodopsin turnover rate, rhodopsin was tagged with a special fluorescent reporter Timer, which changes color with the function of time, to report rhodopsin turnover activity.; Phosphorylation of rhodopsin is a required step in signal deactivation. Rhodopsin exhibits high-gain phosphorylation in vitro whereby hundred-fold molar excess of phosphates are incorporated into the rhodopsin pool per mole of activated rhodopsin. The extent, by which high-gain phosphorylation occurs in the intact mammalian photoreceptor cell, and the molecular mechanism underlying this reaction in vivo, are not known. Trans-phosphorylation is a proposed mechanism for high-gain phosphorylation whereby rhodopsin kinase, upon phosphorylating the activated receptor, continues to phosphorylate nearby non-activated rhodopsin. We utilized two different transgenic mouse models: K <b>296</b> <b>E</b> and cone short-wavelength opsin (S-opsin), and found that trans-phosphorylation occurs in the intact photoreceptor cell. Trans-phosphorylation may {{play an important role in}} light adaptation by decreasing transduction gain and thereby extending the range of the rod response under certain steady-state lighting conditions...|$|R
40|$|In the homotrimeric OmpF porin from Escherichia coli, each {{channel is}} {{constricted}} by a loop protruding into the beta-barrel of the monomer {{about halfway through}} the membrane. The water-filled channels exist in open or closed states, depending on the transmembrane potential. For the transition between these conformations, two fundamentally different mechanisms may be envisaged: a bulk movement of the constriction loop L 3 or a redistribution of charges in the channel lumen.

40|$|Tesis Doctoral inédita leída en la Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Facultad de Ciencias, Departamento de Biología Molecular. Fecha de lectura: 13 - 02 - 2009 African {{swine fever}} virus (ASFV) is a deoxyvirus that {{produces}} a lethal disease in domestic pigs. The ASFV genome encodes several proteins that might constitute a viral base excision repair system (BER), possibly aimed {{to the maintenance of}} viral genome stability. In the infected swine the virus mainly replicates in monocytes and macrophages, which may produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) {{as a response to the}} infection, thus threatening the integrity of the viral DNA. The viral DNA repair system includes an EndoIV-like AP endonuclease (named pE 296 R), a DNA repair polymerase (pol X), a PCNA-like protein (pE 301 R) and a DNA ligase. The biochemical properties of ASFV pol X have been studied before. In this work, we have characterized the biochemical properties of the recombinant purified viral AP endonuclease. The structural properties analyzed and DNA repair enzymatic proper-ties of protein pE 296 R —AP endonucleolytic, 3 ’ 5 ’ exonuclease, 3 ’-diesterase and nucleotide inci-sion repair (NIR) activities— are similar to those previously shown for other EndoIV-like AP endonu-cleases. The characterization of the 3 ’ 5 ’ exonuclease and 3 ’-repair diesterase of pE 296 R suggests that it has a strong preference for mispaired and oxidative base lesions at the 3 ’-termini of single-strand breaks. Furthermore, the expression of <b>E</b> <b>296</b> R gene in a E. coli strain lacking AP endonucle-ases promotes cell survival under chronic treatment with alkylating and oxidative compounds, indi-cating a repair activity in vivo of different DNA damages. We also found that all the enzyme repair activities are inhibited by reducing agents. Binding of the viral AP endonuclease to DNA is suppressed by reducing agents, which might account for the in-hibition of the enzyme’s activities. Moreover, the pE 296 R protein contains intramolecular disulfide bonds. Therefore, formation and breakage of the disulfide bond may provide a regulatory mecha-nism of the enzyme’s DNA repair activities. Finally, we have also tried to address the biological role of the viral DNA repair system. First, we analyzed the accumulation and intracellular distribution of the viral proteins pE 301 R, pE 296 R and pol X. The pattern of distribution of these proteins in the context of viral infection is compatible with shared a role together in DNA repair, but also with other possible unique functions for each protein. Using ASFV deletion mutants in genes <b>E</b> <b>296</b> R and pol X, we have determined that the viral endonuc-lease is essential for virus growth in macrophages, but not in Vero cells. The viral pol X is also re-quired in macrophages but only under conditions of repetitive infection cycles. The biochemical and genetic properties of ASFV AP endonuclease and pol X are consistent with the repair of DNA damage generated by the genotoxic intracellular environment of the host macrophage. This work supports the existence of a viral reparative system to maintain virus viability in the infected macrophage...|$|E
40|$|We {{show here}} that the African swine fever virus (ASFV) protein pE 296 R, {{predicted}} to be a class II apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease, possesses endonucleolytic activity specific for AP sites. Biochemical characterization of the purified recombinant enzyme indicated that the Km and catalytic efficiency values for the endonucleolytic reaction {{are in the range}} of those reported for Escherichia coli endonuclease IV (endo IV) and human Ape 1. In addition to endonuclease activity, the ASFV enzyme has a proofreading 3 ′→ 5 ′ exonuclease activity that is considerably more efficient in the elimination of a mismatch than in that of a correctly paired base. The three-dimensional structure predicted for the pE 296 R protein underscores the structural similarities between endo IV and the viral protein, supporting a common mechanism for the cleavage reaction. During infection, the protein is expressed at early times and accumulates at later times. The early enzyme is localized in the nucleus and the cytoplasm, while the late protein is found only in the cytoplasm. ASFV carries two other proteins, DNA polymerase X and ligase, that, together with the viral AP endonuclease, could act as a viral base excision repair system to protect the virus genome in the highly oxidative environment of the swine macrophage, the virus host cell. Using an ASFV deletion mutant lacking the <b>E</b> <b>296</b> R gene, we have determined that the viral endonuclease is required for virus growth in macrophages but not in Vero cells.

These GATA 4 missense mutations, but not a mutation causing secundum atrial septal defects (S 52 F), demonstrated impaired protein interactions with SMAD 4, a transcription factor required for canonical bone morphogenetic protein/transforming growth factor-β (BMP/TGF-β) signaling. Gata 4 and Smad 4 genetically interact in vivo: atrioventricular septal defects result from endothelial-specific Gata 4 and Smad 4 compound haploinsufficiency. Endothelial-specific knockout of Smad 4 caused an absence of valve-forming activity: Smad 4 -deficient endocardium was associated with acellular endocardial cushions, absent epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation, reduced endocardial proliferation, and loss of Id 2 expression in valve-forming regions. We show that Gata 4 and Smad 4 cooperatively activated the Id 2 promoter, that human GATA 4 mutations abrogated this activity, and that Id 2 deficiency in mice could cause atrioventricular septal defects. We suggest that one determinant of the phenotypic spectrum caused by human GATA 4 mutations is differential effects on GATA 4 /SMAD 4 interactions required for endocardial cushion development...|$|R

The degradation of all mutants (except E 59 K) was partially inhibited by treatment with kifunensine, a selective inhibitor of ER (endoplasmic reticulum) alpha-mannosidase I. Metabolic labelling and subcellular fractionation studies in COS- 7 cells expressing the L 166 V and R 301 Q alpha-Gal A mutants indicated that the mutant protein was retained in the ER and degraded without processing. Addition of DGJ (1 -deoxygalactonojirimycin) to the culture medium of COS- 7 cells transfected with a large set of missense mutant alpha-Gal A cDNAs effectively increased both enzyme activity and protein yield. DGJ was capable of normalizing intracellular processing of mutant alpha-Gal A found in both classic (L 166 V) and variant (R 301 Q) Fabry disease patients. In addition, the residual enzyme activity in fibroblasts or lymphoblasts from both classic and variant hemizygous Fabry disease patients carrying a variety of missense mutations could be substantially increased by cultivation of the cells with DGJ. These results indicate that a large proportion of mutant enzymes in patients with residual enzyme activity are kinetically active. Excessive degradation in the ER could be responsible for the deficiency of enzyme activity in vivo, and the DGJ approach may be broadly applicable to Fabry disease patients with missense mutations...|$|R

Despite the specific phenotype of genetic vrn 1 mutants, the VERNALIZATION 1 (VRN 1) protein localizes throughout the nucleus and shows sequence-nonspecific binding in vitro. In this work, we used a dominant repressor tag that overcomes genetic redundancy to show that VRN 1 is involved in processes beyond vernalization that are essential for Arabidopsis development.

40|$|A {{total of}} <b>296</b> <b>E.</b> coli strains {{isolated}} from hospitalized patients with {{urinary tract infection}} were included in this study. These strains were tested for their resistance to 22 antimicrobial drugs {{and the presence of}} ESBLs genes coding for TEM, SHV, OXA, and CTX-M. We further characterized them for their interaction with a renal cell line (A- 498) and a gastrointestinal cell line (Caco- 2). Strains were also typed using a combination of RAPD-PCR, PhP-typing and phylogenetic grouping. Only eight strains (2. 7 %) were confirmed as ESBLs producers. The most common clonal type contained 35 isolates and only two of them were ESBLs producers and both showed a high degree of adhesion to both cell lines but only one was able to translocate in Caco- 2 cells. These strains belonged to phylogenetic group B 2, were resistant to nine antibiotics and carried CTX-Mtype of ESBL. The remaining six strains belonged to single clones with different phylogenetic groups and ESBL genotypes and were resistant to between 12 and 15 antibiotics. They also showed a high rate of adhesion to A- 498 cells (19 ± 2 to 35 ± 3 CFU/cell) and all translocated in this cell line. The rate of adhesion of ESBL-producing strains to Caco- 2 cells (11 ± 3. 4 CFU/cell) was significantly lower than A- 498 cells (26 ± 8 CFU/cell) (p 00. 0002) and only four of them translocated in Caco- 2 cells. Our results suggest that the ESBL-producing clones of E. coli have a potential to translocate and cause septicemia in hospitalized patients with UTI...|$|R
40|$|More than 70 {{mutations}} in the gene encoding the visual pigment rhodopsin {{have been identified}} in patients with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. Most of these mutations are thought to interfere with proper folding of the membrane protein. However, families with a severe phenotype of retinitis pigmentosa have been identified and shown to carry a mutation at the site of chromophore attachment, Lys- 296. This mutation disrupts the inactive conformation of opsin and results in a constitutively active protein that can activate the rod-specific GTP-binding protein, transducin, in the absence of light {{and in the absence of}} the chromophore 11 -cis-retinal. It has been suggested that this mutant opsin molecule may cause rod degeneration by depletion of the components used to inactivate rhodopsin, such as rhodopsin kinase. In this work we test this idea by determining whether two constitutively active opsin mutants are phosphorylated by rhodopsin kinase. We found that opsin mutants where Lys- 296 is replaced either by Glu (K <b>296</b> <b>E)</b> or by Gly (K 296 G) are not substrates of rhodopsin kinase in the absence of chromophore. However, when K 296 G is regenerated with a Schiff base complex of 11 -cis-retinal and n-propylamine and exposed to illumination, phosphorylation of opsin occurs. These experiments suggest that in the rod photoreceptors of patients with retinitis pigmentosa carrying a mutation at Lys- 296, there is persistent activation of the GTP-binding protein-mediated cascade. This may result in a situation that mimics long-term exposure to continuous illumination and results in the degeneration of photoreceptors...|$|R

40|$|Erythromycin, a {{macrolide}} antibiotic, is {{used for}} the treat-ment of diseases caused by gram-positive bacteria (7). Resis-tance to macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B in many isolates is due to so-called erm genes, encoding RNA methylases (6). Several classes of rRNA methylases in gram-positive cocci, in Bacillus spp., and in erythromycin-producing actinomycetes have been identified previously (1, 10). How-ever, the detection of erm(A) in Enterococcus faecalis has not been reported to date. In this study, a total of <b>296</b> <b>E.</b> faecalis strains isolated from animals (n 147) and humans (n 149) were screened for the presence of the erm(A) gene by PCR. The 147 E. faecalis strains of animal origin were originally isolated from pig manure and identified in a previous study (3). The 149 human isolates were provided from hospitals of max-imal and regional care, as well as from resident microbiological laboratories in Bavaria, Germany. Species identifications were verified by API 20 Strep (bioMérieux). All strains proved to be resistant to tetracycline (MIC 4 g/ml). All isolates were tested by the broth microdilution method as prescribed by DIN 58940 - 81 : 2002 - 10 from the Deutsches Institut für Normung (2) and as described elsewhere (4), except that 100 l of the dilution was added to 12 ml of Mueller-Hinton bouillon (Table 1). E. faecalis DNA was extracted using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qia-gen). Primers and PCR conditions were chosen according to the guidelines of Khan et al. (6). The 609 -bp products were stored at 4 °C until their analysis on agarose gel. Each PCR cycle included one positive and one negative control.

40|$|Genetic {{factors are}} of {{importance}} for interindividual and interethnic differences in drug response and cancer susceptibility. In the present investigation the role of genetic polymorphism in the cytochromes P 450 CYPIAI, CYP 2 C 19, CYP 2 D 6, CYP 2 EI {{as well as in}} glutathione S-transferase Ml (GSTMI) and microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) for differences in drug response and cancer susceptibility has been investigated in various ethnic populations. The polymorphism of debrisoquine hydroxylase (CYP 2 D 6) and S-mephenytoin hydroxylase (CYP 2 CI 9) has been well documented in Caucasian and Oriental populations but not in African populations. Examination of an Ethiopian population revealed an unexpectedly high amount of subjects (29 %) with duplicated and multiduplicated active CYP 2 D 6 genes (n=l 15), whereas only two poor metabolizers (PMs) of debrisoquine were found. About 5 % of the Ethiopian population were poor metabolizers of S-mephenytoin and the two known mutant alleles CYP 2 C 19 * 2 and CYP 2 C 19 * 3 explained all the PMs. Diminished CYP 2 D 6 activity has also been observed in a Zimbabwean Shona population (ZimS). CYP 2 D 6 genes were sequenced from ZimS subjects being slow, intermediate and fast in debrisoquine hydroxylation. A new variant gene (CYP 2 D 6 * 17) exhibiting three functional mutations (Thrl 07 - 11 <b>e,</b> Arg <b>296</b> -Cys, Ser 486 -Thr) -was found. The allele frequency in the ZimS population was 34 % and showed a gene dose association with lower capacity for debrisoquine hydroxylation. The distnbution of the CYP 2 D 6 * 17 allele m the Ethiopian population with an allele frequency of 9 % partially explained the lower debrisoquine hydroxylase activity observed in this population. A Japanese study descnbed a lower frequency of a variant CYP 2 EI allele (C) in lung cancer patients as compared to controls. Such a relationship was not found when the CYP 2 EI polymorphism was examined in Swedish lung cancer patients (n= 193) and controls (n= 206). By contrast, a significantly lower frequency of another allele (c 2), described to infiuence CYP 2 EI gene expression in vitro, was found in the lung cancer patients. A similar tendency was also found when Chinese lung cancer patients and a reference population was compared, whereas no differences were seen in the distribution of polymorphic alleles of CYPIAI and GSTMI, in contrast to studies previously carried out among Japanese. The distribution of polymorphic mEH alleles were found to be similar in the reference and lung cancer groups. A polymorphism in the CYPIAI gene causing an lle 462 -Val amino acid exchange has been found. CYPlAI-Val has been claimed to be overrepresented among lung cancer patients and to cause a higher activity and formation of mutagens from benzo(a) pyrene as compared to CYPlAI-lle. Construction of the corresponding cDNAs and expression in yeast revealed, however, that they exhibited the same kinetics for benzo(a) pyrene and ethoxyresorufm. This indicates no functional differences between the CYPIAI forms and support the data by us and other investigators, that subjects carrying this allele do not have an increased risk for lung cancer.

40|$|Abstract Background There is {{no doubt}} that the {{perceived}} stigma of having a mental disorder acts as a barrier to help seeking. It is possible that personnel may be reluctant to admit to symptoms suggestive of poor mental health when such data can be linked to them, even if their personal details are only used to help them access further care. This may be particularly relevant because individuals who have a mental health problem are more likely to experience barriers to care and hold stigmatizing beliefs. If that is the case, then mental health screening programmers may not be effective in detecting those most in need of care. We aimed to compare mental health symptom reporting when using an anonymous versus identifiable questionnaire among UK military personnel on deployment in Iraq. Methods Survey among UK military personnel using two questionnaires, one was anonymous (n[*]=[*] 315) and one collected contact details (i. <b>e.</b> identifiable, n[*]=[*] <b>296).</b> Distribution was by alternate allocation. Data were collected in Iraq during January-February 2009. Results No significant difference in the reporting of symptoms of common mental disorders was found (18. 1 % of identifiable vs. 22. 9 % of anonymous participants). UK military personnel were more likely to report sub-threshold and probable PTSD when completing questionnaires anonymously (sub-threshold PTSD: 2. 4 % of identifiable vs. 5. 8 % of anonymous participants; probable PTSD: 1. 7 % of identifiable vs. 4. 8 % of anonymous participants). Of the 11 barriers to care and perceived social stigma statements considered, those completing the anonymous questionnaire compared to those completing the identifiable questionnaire were more likely to endorse three statements: “leaders discourage the use of mental health services” (9. 3 % vs. 4. 6 %), “it would be too embarrassing” (41. 6 % vs. 32. 5 %) and “I would be seen as weak” (46. 6 % vs. 34. 2 %). Conclusions We found a significant effect on the reporting of sub-threshold and probable PTSD and certain stigmatizing beliefs (but not common mental disorders) when using an anonymous compared to identifiable questionnaire, with the anonymous questionnaire resulting in a higher prevalence of PTSD and increased reporting of three stigmatizing beliefs. This has implications for the conduct of mental health screening and research in the US and UK military. </p...|$|R

A produção de MS seguiu um modelo linear de predição em função das doses efluente avícola, em que o tratamento com 250 kg ha- 1 de N foi 55 % maior, quando comparado com o tratamento de 50 kg ha- 1 de N. Todas as características morfogênicas e estruturais avaliadas com exceção do filocrono apresentaram comportamento linear positivo. Dessa forma, o efluente de abatedouro avícola pode ser utilizado como uma alternativa para adubação do capim-piatã, pois este respondeu de maneira crescente até a dose máxima testada. The organic {{fertilizer}} {{is considered a}} viable alternative {{for the production of}} forage grasses. However there is little information about the rates and composition of the {{organic fertilizer}}s. According to this assumption the objective {{of this study was to}} figure out the best dose of effluent from poultry processing plants in order to improve the structural, morphogenetic and productive characteristics of Piata palidadegrass. The experiment was carried out at a greenhouse and performed in a completely randomized design in which five doses of effluent, 324, 648, 972, 1296 and 1620 m³ ha- 1 were tested and equivalent to 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 kg ha- 1 de N respectively. The measured variables were: dry matter (DM), leaf appearance rate, leaf elongation rate, phyllochron, pseudo stem elongation rate, final leaf length and numbers of green leaves. The production of DM presented a linear prediction model according to the N rates, while the treatment with 250 kg ha- 1 de N was 55 % higher when compared to the treatment with 50 kg ha- 1 de N. All morphogenetic and structural characteristics that were evaluated presented a positive linear fashion, except the phyllochron. Thus, the effluent from poultry processing plant may be used as an alternative to fertilization of the 'Piata' palisadegrass because this responded by increasing the maximum dose tested...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} whether hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) could effectively protect the small intestine mucosa against an ischemic insult, according to different periods of application. METHODS: The gut of 32 male rats {{was subjected to}} 60 -min ischemia (clamping the mesenteric artery and vein); After they were further reperfused upon clamp opening during 60 min. Animal groups were as follows. GII = placed on HBO during the ischemia period; GIII = placed on HBO during reperfusion; GIV = treated with HBO throughout the ischemia-reperfusion period. Some animals (GI) did not receive HBO treatment at all and served as reference of ischemia-reperfusion injury (IR). HBO {{was carried out in}} a cylindrical acrylic chamber (2. 0 ATA). Samples of small bowel were prepared for H. E staining for histological evaluations. RESULTS: The histological injury of mucosa was significantly less when HBO was administered during the ischemia period (17. 6 ± 0. 6) as compared with the IR (21. 3 ± 1. 8). HBO was not effective when applied during reperfusion (23. 1 ± 2. 1) or during the ischemia plus reperfusion period (18. 7 ± 1. 9). The thickness of the mucosa was preserved by HBO in ischemia (327. 50 ± 30. 23 µm) in comparison with the IR (172. 79 ± 5. 95 µm). In the periods of reperfusion (162. 50 ± 6. 05 µm) and ischemia plus reperfusion (296. 49 ± 20. 01 µm) the mucosa revealed a structural injury. CONCLUSION: Hyperbaric oxygen affects the ischemic insult of small bowel, being the favorable effect obtained when hyperbaric oxygen was administered early in the ischemic period. OBJETIVO: Determinar se a oxigenação hiperbárica (OHB) protege a mucosa do intestino delgado de ratos após isquemia e reperfusão. MÉTODOS: 32 ratos machos foram submetidos a clampeamento da artéria e da veia mesentéricas superiores durante 60 minutos (isquemia) seguido de 60 minutos de reperfusão. Após estes procedimentos os animais fora separados em quatro grupos, a saber: grupo I (GI) isquemia e reperfusão (IR); grupo II (GII) submetido a OHB concomitante a isquemia, Grupo III (GIII) submetido a OHB durante a reperfusão e, grupo IV (GIV) submetido a OHB durante o período de isquemia e de reperfusão. A OHB foi realizada em câmara acrílica (2. 0 ATA). Após anestesia, fragmentos do intestino delgado (íleo) foram fixados e processados para inclusão em parafina sendo os cortes corados pelo HE. As lâminas foram avaliadas quanto a presença de lesões histopatológicas da mucosa e avaliado a espessura da mucosa. RESULTADOS: A lesão histopatológica da mucosa foi significativamente inferior quando a OHB foi administrada na isquemia (12. 6 ± 0. 6) em comparação com o IR (21. 3 ± 1. 8). A OHB não foi efetiva quando aplicada durante a reperfusão (23. 1 ± 2. 1), ou durante a isquemia e reperfusão (18. 7 ± 1. 9). A espessura da mucosa foi preservada pela OHB na isquemia (327, 50 ± 30. 23 µm) em comparação com o IR (172. 79 ± 5. 95 µm). Nos períodos de reperfusão (162. 50 ± 6. 05 µm) <b>e</b> a isquemia (<b>296.</b> 49 ± 20. 01 µm) a mucosa apresentou lesão estrutural.

A depressÃo Ã causada por um dÃficit funcional das monoaminas nas suas vias transmissoras (serotoninÃrgicas, noradrenÃrgica e dopaminÃrgicas) em certos locais do cÃrebro. Apesar de existirem diversas formas de tratamento clÃnico desse transtorno do humor como: psicoterapia, antidepressivos, ECT e TMS, a prescriÃÃo das drogas antidepressivas representa a {{principal}} forma de manejo das chamadas depressÃes endÃgenas. A modulaÃÃo funcional das vias de transmissÃo neuroquÃmica pode interferir no desempenho do processamento de funÃÃes cognitivas como a memÃria. Objetivo: Nosso estudo procurou investigar as possÃveis alteraÃÃes em diferentes tipos e fases da memÃria provocadas pelo uso crÃnico de diferentes manejos de antidepressivos; monoterapia e terapia combinada. MÃtodos: Utilizamos nessa pesquisa a administraÃÃo crÃnica de trÃs drogas antidepressivas e suas associaÃÃes (Paroxetina, Venlafaxina e Bupropiona) de largo uso na prÃtica clÃnica. Para avaliaÃÃo do desempenho mnemÃnico utilizamos modelos comportamentais para ratos com alto valor preditivo para memÃria (labirinto radial, esquiva passiva) e para atividade exploratÃria (campo aberto). Foram medidos os nÃveis de BDNF e a atividade enzimÃtica da AChE do hipocampo dos grupos de ratos usuÃrios de antidepressivos. Resultados: No Labirinto Radial â fase de aquisiÃÃo: os grupos Venlaf (11 Â 4, 85), Venlaf+Parox (10, 88 Â 5, 30) e Venlaf + Buprop (11 Â 3, 85) apresentaram nÃmero de tentativas de treinos significativamente maior comparado ao desempenho dos animais do grupo controle (5, 11 Â 1, 36), enquanto os grupos com Parox (4, 14 Â 2, 19), Buprop (7, 1 Â 3, 66) sozinha e Parox + Bup (4, 75 Â 1, 75) nÃo apresentaram alteraÃÃes do nÃmero de tentativas significantes.

Labirinto Radial â ML: grupos usuÃrios de Venla (4, 5 Â 1, 64), Buprop (4 Â 2, 3) e Venlaf+ Bup (2, 87 Â 1, 72) nÃo apresentaram alteraÃÃes significativamente diferente do grupo controle (3. 11 Â 1, 36), enquanto que o grupo usuÃrio de Parox (4, 4 Â 1, 50) apresentou um nÃmero significativamente maior de erros em relaÃÃo ao grupo controle (3. 11 Â 1, 36). Os grupos usuÃrios de Venlaf + Parox (2, 66 Â 0, 85) e Parox+Buprop (3, 12 Â 2, 16) apresentaram um nÃmero de erros significativamente menor quando comparados ao nÃmero de erros na Parox (4, 4 Â 1, 50). Esquiva Passiva â MC e ML:os grupos usuÃrios de Parox (218, 4 Â 113, 1), Bup (39, 57 Â 23, 19) e Parox+Buprop (300 Â 0, 0) apresentaram um tempo de latÃncia significativamente (p< 0, 001) maior em relaÃÃo ao grupo controle (270 Â 37, 30). ML: os grupos usuÃrios de Venlaf+Parox (218, 1 Â 103, 6) <b>e</b> Parox+ Bup (<b>296,</b> 7 Â 8, 69) reverteram o aumento do tempo de latÃncia do grupo de Parox (218, 1 Â 103, 6) e causou uma diminuiÃÃo significativa (p< 0, 001) do tempo de permanÃncia do rato no compartimento claro em relaÃÃo ao mesmo grupo. Campo Aberto â N 0 cruzamentos: Parox (20, 80 Â 3, 85) apresentou um aumento significativo do nÃmero de cruzamentos em relaÃÃo ao grupo controle (14, 90 Â 3, 85), enquanto que o grupo usuÃrio de Parox+Buprop (12 Â 2, 50) reverteu o aumento da atividade locomotora do grupo da Parox (20, 80 Â 3, 85). ConclusÃes: no teste de aquisiÃÃo houve prejuÃzo de desempenho nos grupos usuÃrios de antidepressivos com pouca seletividade para recaptaÃÃo de serotonina. O desempenho da MC e ML, em habilidades visuo-espaciais, obtivemos dÃficits nos grupos de antidepressivos que potencializam tanto a aÃÃo serotoninÃrgica, com a aÃÃo dopaminÃrgica.

Introduction: Depression is a chronic and recurrent psychopathological condition, with obvious socio-occupational injury {{and quality of}} life in both the acute and long term. Depression is caused by afunctional deficit of monoamines in their signaling pathways (serotoninergic, dopaminergic, noradrenergic) in certain parts of the brain. Although there are various forms of clinical treatment of mood disorders such as psychotherapy, antidepressants, ECT and TMS, the prescription of antidepressant drugs is the main form of management of calls endogenous depressions. The functional modulation of neurochemical transmission paths can interfere with the processing performance of cognitive functions like memory. Objective: Our study sought to investigate the possible changes in different types and stages of memory caused by chronic use of antidepressants from different managements; monotherapy and combination therapy. Methods: We use this research to chronic administration of three antidepressant drugs and their associations (paroxetine, venlafaxine and bupropion) widely used in clinical practice. To evaluate the performance mnemonic to use behavioral models predictive of mice with eigen value memory (radial maze, passive avoidance) and exploratory activity (open field). They measured levels of BDNF and AChE in the hippocampus of rats in groups of antidepressant users. Results: Radial Maze - acquisition phase: the Venlaf group (11 Â 4. 85), associated with Venlaf Parox (10, 88 Â 5, 30) associated with Buprop and Venlaf (11 Â 3. 85) showed a number of training trials significantly higher compared to that of the control group (5. 11 Â 1. 36), while groups with Parox (4, 14 Â 2. 19), Buprop (7. 1 Â 3. 66) associated with Parox alone and Buprop (4. 75 Â 1. 75) showed no change in the number of significant attempts. Radial Maze - MC: Venlaf groups (2. 16 Â 1. 47) associated with Venlaf Parox (2. 85 Â 1. 35) associated with Buprop and Venlaf (2. 62 Â 1. 76) showed no significant changes compared to the user group of saline (2. 25 Â 1. 58) while users of antidepressants Parox (3. 11 Â 1. 69), Buprop (4. 9 Â 2. 99) associated with Buprop and Parox (4. 12 Â 2. 58) had significantly (p < 0. 001) greater errors in the control group (2. 25 Â 1. 58). Radial Maze â ML: Venlaf users groups (4. 5 Â 1. 64), Buprop (4 Â 2. 3) associated with Buprop and Venlaf (2. 87 Â 1. 72) showed no significant than the control group (3. 11 Â 1. 36),where as the group user Parox (4. 4 Â 1. 50) howed a significantly greater errors in the control group (3. 11 Â 1, 36) Venlaf users groups associated with Parox (2. 66 Â 0. 85) associated with Buprop and Parox (3. 12 Â 2. 16) had a number of errors significantly lower when compared to the number of errors in Paroxetine (4. 4 Â 1. 50). Avoidance passive âMC and ML : Parox users groups(218. 4 Â 113. 1) Buprop (39. 57 Â 23. 19) and associated with Parox Buprop (300 Â 0. 0) showed a significant lag time higher in the control group (270 Â 37. 30). ML: Venlaf users groups associated with Parox (218. 1 Â 103. 6) associated with Buprop and Parox (296. 7 Â 8. 69) revert the increase in the latency time of the Parox (218, 1 Â 103, 6) and caused a significant decrease the time spent in the compartment of the mouse course over the same group. Open Field: Parox (20. 80 Â 3. 85) increased significantly in the control (14. 90 Â 3. 85) while the user group Buprop associated with Parox (12 Â 2. 50) reversed the increase in locomotor activity of the Parox group (20. 80 Â 3. 85). Conclusions: the test of acquisition show loss of performance in groups o antidepressant users with little selectivity for serotonin reuptake. The MC and ML in visual-spatial skills, we found deficits in groups of antidepressants that potentiate both serotonin action with dopaminergic action. The potentiation of &# 946;-adrenergic is associated with increased level of alertness and improves the performance of establishment and consolidation of MC and ML...|$|R
