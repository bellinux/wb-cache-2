25|$|At {{approximately}} 1:30 on {{the morning}} of 14 September 2005, the cliff over the houses of Hatlestad Terrasse broke apart; the resulting slide of clay, mud and rocks did not collapse the buildings. The debris flowed through the ground floors of several houses and buried ten people. Occupants on higher floors were not touched by the flowing debris and were then evacuate through non-first floor windows. The municipality and the city hospital were both put on <b>disaster</b> <b>alert,</b> and a large number of emergency responders, including 12 ambulances, were sent to the scene. The first unit to reach the site was a fire engine which arrived only three minutes after the slide, as it was already in the area, having just completed a water draining mission, and it was able to use its siren to awaken residents for the start of an evacuation. In addition to firefighters and paramedics, the Civil Defense and the National Guard also responded. Search dogs were used to locate survivors because heavy machinery could not be deployed due to the unstable nature of the ground; the extraction of buried survivors was made by hand, and with tools such as axes and shovels.|$|E

In more detail, the study aims to assess the tsunami hazard on the Mentawai and Sumatra coasts: the tsunami heights and arrival times have been estimated employing three propagation models based on the long wave theory. The automatic alert level for the earthquake was given between Green and Orange Alert, which, in the logic of GDACS means no need or moderate need of international humanitarian assistance; however, the earthquake generated 3 to 9 m tsunami run-up along southwestern coasts of the Pagai Islands where 431 people died. The post event calculations indicated medium-high humanitarian impacts. JRC. G. 2 -Global security and crisis managemen...|$|R

40|$|The {{storm surge}} is an {{abnormal}} rise of water above the astronomical tides, generated by strong winds and {{a drop in}} the atmospheric pressure, due to the passage of a Tropical Cyclone (TC) or an intense low pressure system in general. The JRC has developed the first storm surge calculation system for the TCs in 2011, including the results in the Global <b>Disasters</b> <b>Alert</b> and Coordination System (GDACS). The TCs are not the only weather system that can generate a storm surge event, therefore the JRC has developed a new Storm Surge Calculation System (SSCS) in 2013, to simulate the storm surge also in Europe. The SSCS system has been established at the JRC in the frame of GDACS and it is intended as a series of procedures that use meteorological forecasts forcing conditions produced by several meteorological centers to obtain the expected sea level rise along the coasts. Every day several SSCS bulletins are created for different areas of Europe. The JRC is currently implementing this system also in GDACS.

NWR requires a special radio receiver or scanner capable of picking up the signal. Individual NWR stations broadcast any one of seven allocated frequencies centered on 162 MHz (known collectively as [...] "weather band") in the VHF radio frequency band. In recent years, national emergency response agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Homeland Security have begun to take advantage of NWR's ability to efficiently reach {{a large portion of the}} U.S. population.

40|$|The Global <b>Disasters</b> <b>Alert</b> and Coordination System (GDACS) {{automatically}} invokes ad hoc numerical {{models to}} analyse {{the level of}} the hazard of natural disasters like earthquakes, tsunamis, tropical cyclones, floods and volcanoes. The Tropical Cyclones (TCs) are among the most damaging events, due to strong winds, heavy rains and storm surge. In order to estimate the area and the population affected, all three types of the above physical impacts must be taken into account. GDACS includes all these dangerous effects, using various sources of data. The JRC set up an automatic routine that includes the TC information provided by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) into a single database, covering all TCs basins. This information is used in GDACS for the wind impact and as input for the JRC storm surge system. Recently the global numerical models and other TC models have notably improved their resolutions, therefore one of the first aim of this work is the assessment and implementation of new data sources for the wind, storm surge and rainfall impacts in GDACS. Moreover the TC modelling workflow has been revised in order to provide redundancy, transparency and efficiency while addressing issues of accuracy and incorporation of additional physical processes. The status of development is presented along with the outline of future steps. JRC. E. 1 -Disaster Risk Managemen...|$|R

Tropical Cyclone ISAAC affected the southern parts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama with heavy rainfall, strong winds and storm surge, causing flooding, power outages, damage to property and, according to media report, killing at least 7 people. Most of this damage has been caused by heavy rains and storm surge.
