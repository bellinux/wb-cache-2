5|$|Adler wrote <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>memoir</b> {{that the}} passion of his future wife Sonya Oberlander (and of her family) for theater, and their vision of what Yiddish theater could become, kept him in the {{profession}} despite his uncle's view. When she was cast by Rosenberg opposite Jacob Spivakovsky {{in the title role}} of Abraham Goldfaden's darkly comic operetta Breindele Cossack, she pulled strings so that the role of Guberman would be reassigned to Adler.|$|E
5|$|Monotype's {{well-known}} executive Stanley Morison wrote <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>memoir</b> {{that the}} italic {{was based on}} Granjon's work, but as Carter's annotations of it note, this seems generally to be a mistake. The swash capitals, however, at least, probably {{are based on the}} work of Granjon. Some publicity art for it in the metal period was created by a young Rodney Peppé.|$|E

5|$|Wright's sermon left a great {{impression}} on Obama, who recounted Wright's sermon in detail <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>memoir</b> Dreams from My Father. Soon after Dreams From My Father was published {{he went into}} politics, entering the Illinois Senate. In 2004 he was chosen to deliver the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. In Obama's 2006 memoir The Audacity of Hope, he recollects that on being chosen to deliver this speech, he pondered the topics on which he had previously campaigned, and on major issues then affecting the nation, before thinking about the variety of people he had met while campaigning, all endeavouring in different ways to improve {{their own lives and}} to serve their country.|$|E
5|$|Aubrey fought {{constantly}} {{with officials}} of CBS News, especially its chief, Fred W. Friendly, {{who was just}} as demanding and controlling as Aubrey. Friendly felt Aubrey was insufficiently concerned with public affairs and <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>memoir,</b> Due to Circumstances Beyond Our Control, recounts one budget meeting at CBS when Aubrey talked at length of how much money the news was costing the company, a sea of red ink that could be stopped by replacing news with more entertainment programs. However, Paley supported the news and protected Friendly's division from Aubrey's proposed budget cuts. Aubrey in 1962 ordered {{that there would be}} fewer specials, both entertainment and news, because he felt interruptions to the schedule alienated viewers by disrupting their routine viewing, sending them to the competition. Friendly resented this move.|$|E

5|$|Specter {{was born}} in Wichita, Kansas, the {{youngest}} child of Lillie (née Shanin) and Harry Specter, {{who grew up in}} the Bachkuryne village of Cherkasy Oblast, Ukraine. Specter was Jewish, and wrote <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>memoir,</b> Passion for Truth, that his father's family was the only Jewish family in the village. The family lived at 940 South Emporia Street in Wichita before moving to Russell, Kansas, where he graduated from Russell High School in 1947. Russell is also the hometown of fellow politician Bob Dole (who graduated from Russell High School in 1941). Specter said that his father weighed items from his junkyard on a scale owned by Dole's father Doran Dole (who owned a granary). He said his brother Morton and Dole's brother Kenny were contemporaries and friends.|$|E
5|$|On January 27, 1984, Michael {{and other}} members of the Jacksons filmed a Pepsi {{commercial}} overseen by executive Phil Dusenberry, a BBDO ad agency executive, and Alan Pottasch, Pepsi's Worldwide Creative Director, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. During a simulated concert before a full house of fans, pyrotechnics accidentally set Jackson's hair on fire, causing second-degree burns to his scalp. Jackson underwent treatment to hide the scars and had his third rhinoplasty shortly thereafter. Pepsi settled out of court, and Jackson donated the $1.5 million settlement to the Brotman Medical Center in Culver City, California; its Michael Jackson Burn Center is named in his honor. Dusenberry recounted the episode <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>memoir,</b> Then We Set His Hair on Fire: Insights and Accidents from a Hall of Fame Career in Advertising. Jackson signed a second agreement with Pepsi in the late 1980s for a reported $10 million. The second campaign had a global reach of more than 20 countries and would provide financial support for Jackson's Bad album and 1987–88 world tour. Although Jackson had endorsements and advertising deals with other companies, such as LA Gear, Suzuki, and Sony, none were as significant as his deals with Pepsi, which later signed other music stars such as Britney Spears and Beyoncé to promote its products.|$|E
