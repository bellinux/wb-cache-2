40|$|The long crack {{threshold}} behaviour of polycrystalline Udimet 720 {{has been}} investigated. Faceted crack growth is seen near threshold when the monotonic crack tip plastic zone is {{contained within the}} coarsest grain size. At very high load ratios R (=P min/P max) it is possiblefor the monotonic crack tip plastic zone to exceed the coarsest grain size throughout the entire crack growth regime and non 1 aceted structure insensitive crack growth is then seen down to threshold. Intrinsic threshold values were obtained for non 1 aceted and faceted crack growth using a constant K max, increasing K min, computer controlled load shedding technique (K is stress intensity factor). Very high R values are obtained at threshold using this technique (0. 75 - 0. 95), eliminating closure effects, so the intrinsic resistance of the material to crack propagation is reflected in these values. The intrinsic non 1 aceted threshold value ΔK th is lower (2. 3 <b>MN</b> <b>m</b> - 3 / 2) than the intrinsicfaceted ΔK th <b>value</b> (4. 8 <b>MN</b> <b>m</b> - 3 / 2). This is thought to reflect not only the effect of crack branching and deflection (in the faceted case) on the crack driving force, but also the inherent difference in resistance of the material to the two different crack propagation micromechanisms. © 1993 The Institute of Materials...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the microstructure, surface states, valence fluctuations, {{magnetic}} properties, and exchange bias effect in MnO 2 nanowires. High purity alpha-MnO 2 rectangular nanowires were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method with microwave-assisted procedures. The microstructure analysis indicates that the nanowires grow in the [0 0 1] direction with the (2 1 0) plane as the surface. Mn 3 + and Mn 2 + ions are {{not found in the}} system by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The effective magnetic moment of the manganese ions fits in with the theoretical and <b>experimental</b> <b>values</b> of <b>Mn</b> 4 + very well. The uncoupled spins in 3 d(3) orbitals of the Mn 4 + ions in MnO 6 octahedra on the rough surface are responsible for the net magnetic moment. Spin glass behavior is observed through magnetic measurements. Furthermore, the exchange bias effect is observed {{for the first time in}} pure alpha-MnO 2 phase due to the coupling of the surface spin glass with the antiferromagnetic alpha-MnO 2 matrix. These alpha-MnO 2 nanowires, with a spin-glass-like behavior and with an exchange bias effect excited by the uncoupled surface spins, should therefore inspire further study concerning the origin, theory, and applicability of surface structure induced magnetism in nanostructures...|$|R

40|$|High {{strength}} and high toughness are usually mutually exclusive in brittle filament/brittle matrix composites. The {{high tensile strength}} characteristic of strong interfacial filament/matrix bonding can, however, be combined with the high fracture toughness of weak interfacial bonding, when the filaments are arranged to have alternate sections {{of high and low}} shear stress (and low and high toughness). Such weak and strong areas can be achieved by appropriate intermittent coating of the fibres. The strong regions ensure that the filament strength is picked up; weak areas randomly in the path of running cracks serve to blunt them by the Cook/Gordon mechanism which, in turn, produces long pull-out lengths with an associated large contribution to toughness.
