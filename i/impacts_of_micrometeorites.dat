40|$|Craters {{attributable}} to hypervelocity <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> <b>micrometeorites</b> {{have been discovered}} on rare chondrule-like objects from the gas-rich meteorite Kapoeta. These chondrule-like objects, probably generated by impacts themselves, provide further evidence for the regolith origin of Kapoeta.

30|$|In {{analogy to}} the lunar soil it was {{originally}} assumed that Hayabusa dust grains were affected by space weathering (Chapman [2004]). Space weathering is a fundamental process on airless bodies that causes modifications of mineral surfaces via (i) irradiation by cosmic rays and, in particular, by solar wind ions and/or (ii) via <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> <b>micrometeorites.</b> Such a bombardment with high-energy particles can result in multiple effects: amorphization, sputtering/redepositioning, fracturing, melting, and vaporization of surface material. The complexities of space-weathered mineral surfaces were first studied on lunar samples, showing the formation of thin (50 – 200 nm) amorphous silicate layers that often contain nanometer-sized particles of Fe metal (Keller and McKay [1997]). This nanophase Fe (npFe 0) is considered to alter the spectral properties of asteroid surfaces by reducing the albedo and characteristic mineral absorption bands {{as well as by}} reddening the surface reflectance spectra (Pieters et al. [2000]). These optical effects explain the apparent mismatch between the reflectance spectra of S-type asteroids and those of ordinary chondrites (Binzel et al. [1996]).|$|E

This fine material is produced, at least in part, from collisions between asteroids, and by the <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>micrometeorites</b> upon the asteroids. Due to the Poynting–Robertson effect, the pressure of solar radiation causes this dust to slowly spiral inward toward the Sun.|$|R

50|$|This {{experiment}} contained two sealed pressure zones, extending {{along the}} interior {{walls of the}} satellite, which were designed to record the <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>micrometeorites</b> large enough to pierce the satellite shell. These pressure zones were partial vacuums, each at a different pressure, and were protected by 0.66 mm magnesium walls that presented an exposed surface area of 0.162 m², which was 20% of {{the area of the}} shell. A puncture in the walls of either zone was detected by a differential pressure gauge mounted between them, and telemetered as a change in the length of one of the telemetry channels. Erosion of the satellite shell through bombardment by space dust, micrometeorites, and other particles was recorded by three chromium-strip erosion gauges mounted on the satellite surface, and by a photosensitive detector. Electrical resistances of the gauges changed as their surfaces were changed by erosion. The photosensitive detector, a cadmium sulfide cell protected by an opaque covering of aluminized PET film, also showed a resistance change as the covering was eroded or penetrated. Erosion measurements also were telemetered as channel lengths, which permitted estimates of the erosion rates. Four barium titanate-type microphones recorded micrometeorite impacts on the satellite's surface. The microphone output was amplified, shaped, and fed into a magnetic counter unit, which provided continuously, in three-decimal digits, the cumulative count <b>of</b> <b>impacts.</b> The unit counted up to 1000 and then reset to zero. The satellite recorded 6600 micrometeorite impacts during 66 days of operation, of which 2800 occurred during a 70-h interval from November 16 to 18, 1959. No penetrations or fractures were recorded in the sensors of the surface penetration experiment. Because the erosion sensors were not disrupted, no definite results could be drawn from that experiment.|$|R

40|$|The Earth s moon {{presents}} {{a hostile environment}} in which to live and work. There is no atmosphere to protect its surface from the ravages of solar wind and micrometeorite impacts. As a result, the moon s surface {{is covered with a}} thin layer of fine, charged, reactive dust capable of entering habitats and vehicle compartments, where it can result in crewmember health problems. During the Apollo missions, lunar dusts were introduced into the crew vehicle, resulting in direct exposure and occasional reports of respiratory, dermal and ocular irritation. In order to study the toxicological effects of lunar dust, NASA formed the Lunar Airborne Dust Toxicity Advisory Group (LADTAG). This interdisciplinary group is comprised of leading experts in space toxicology, lunar geology, space medicine and biomedical research. LADTAG has demonstrated that lunar soil contains several types of reactive dusts, including an extremely fine respirable component. These dusts have highly reactive surfaces in the lunar environment; the grains contain surface coatings which are generated by vapor phases formed by hypervelocity <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>micrometeorites.</b> This unique class of dusts has surface properties that are unlike any Earth based analog. These distinctive properties are why lunar dusts are of great toxicological interest. Understanding how these reactive components behave "biochemically" in a moisture-rich pulmonary environment will aid in determining how toxic these particles are to humans. The data obtained from toxicological examination of lunar dusts will determine the human risk criteria for lunar dust exposure and produce a lunar health standard. LADTAG s analysis of lunar dusts and lunar dust simulants will include detailed lunar particle characterizations, determining the properties of particle activation, reactivation of lunar dust, the process of dust passivation and discerning the pathology of lunar dust exposure via inhalation, intratracheal instillation, cell culture exposure, dermal exposure and ocular exposure. The resulting health standard will be time-based and will vary by the duration and type of exposure. It may also be necessary to set multiple standards for different types of lunar dust, as well as for dust in its activated form vs. aged & passivated dust. This standard, set to protect the health of our robust astronaut crews, will not only impact NASA medical operations, but engineering designs as well. The data from our multidisciplinary research are vital in developing remediation devices and environmental monitors. Ultimately, the engineering and safety groups will design and develop countermeasures for space vehicles, suits, rovers and habitats that will be sustained within the limits of the health standard...|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} properties <b>of</b> <b>impact</b> features {{observed in the}} Solar Max main electronics box (MEB) thermal blanket generally suggest an origin by hypervelocity <b>impact.</b> The chemistry <b>of</b> <b>micrometeorite</b> material suggests that {{a wide variety of}} projectile materials have survived <b>impact</b> with retention <b>of</b> varying degrees <b>of</b> pristinity. <b>Impact</b> features that contain only spacecraft paint particles are on average smaller than impact features caused by micrometeorite impacts. In case both types of materials co-occur, it is belevied that the impact feature, generally a penetration hole, was caused by a micrometeorite projectile. The typically smaller paint particles were able to penetrate though the hole in the first layer and deposit in the spray pattern on the second layer. It is suggested that paint particles have arrived {{with a wide range of}} velocities relative to the Solar Max satellite. Orbiting paint particles are an important fraction of materials in the near-Earth environment. In general, the data from the Solar Max studies are a good calibration for the design of capture cells to be flown in space and on board Space Station. The data also suggest that development of multiple layer capture cells in which the projectile may retain a large degree of pristinity is a feasible goal...|$|R

3000|$|The {{accretion}} rate <b>of</b> <b>micrometeorites</b> {{in the last}} glacial period was estimated from the concentrations <b>of</b> <b>micrometeorites</b> in the blue ice around the Yamato Mts. in Antarctica. The samples from this study were collected from the five sampling points (M 03, K 02, K 11, J 09 and J 10) in the blue ice. The blue ice was melted and filtered, and the micrometeorites were handpicked from the collected “glacial sands”. The weight <b>of</b> the <b>micrometeorites</b> in the blue ice was estimated from the abundance <b>of</b> recovered <b>micrometeorites</b> and the solar noble gas concentrations in the “residue” after handpicking. The age of the blue ice from the K area {{was estimated to be}} 27 – 33 kyr before present based on oxygen isotope data. The estimated {{accretion rate}} to the whole Earth ranges from 5300 × 103 kg/a to 16000 × 103 kg/a. However, the lower end of this range probably represents lower limits due to possible loss of solar noble gases during long residence in the glacier ice. Hence, we estimate that the accretion rate <b>of</b> <b>micrometeorites</b> 27 – 33 kyr before present to be in the range between (11000 ± 6600) × 103 kg/a and (16000 ± 9100) × 103 kg/a.

Six of the particles are identified as composite micrometeorites that contain chondritic igneous objects and fine-grained matrix.

40|$|Physical and {{chemical}} reactions occurring {{as a result}} <b>of</b> the highvelocity <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> meteorites and <b>micrometeorites</b> and <b>of</b> cosmic rays and solar-wind particles are major causes of space weathering on airless planetary bodies, such as the Moon, Mercury, and asteroids.

We report here the natural occurrence of the mineral hapkeite, a Fe 2 Si phase, and other associated Fe-Si phases (iron-silicides) in a regolith breccia clast of a lunar highland meteorite. These Fe-Si phases are considered to be a direct product of impact-induced, vapor-phase deposition in the lunar soil, all part of space weathering. We have used an in situ synchrotron energy-dispersive, single-crystal x-ray diffraction technique to confirm the crystal structure of hapkeite as similar to the structure of synthetic Fe 2 Si. This mineral, hapkeite, is named after Bruce Hapke of the University of Pittsburgh, who predicted the presence and importance of vapor-deposited coatings on lunar soil grains some 30 years ago. We propose that this mineral and other Fe-Si phases are probably more common in the lunar regolith than previously thought and are directly related to the formation of vapor-deposited, nanophase elemental iron in the lunar soils...|$|R
