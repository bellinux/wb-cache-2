As the data, the writer {{recorded}} conversations between two participants about sex and their daily activities. To do the analyses, the writer referred to the theories of <b>insertion</b> <b>sequences</b> by Coulthard (1985) and Schegloff (2007). The findings of the study show that topic proffering influences the number of <b>insertion</b> <b>sequences</b> which exist on the conversation. On topic about sex, there were less <b>insertion</b> <b>sequences</b> because the participants felt uncomfortable to talk, which caused a sequence closure. While on the topic about daily activities, there were more <b>insertion</b> <b>sequences</b> because the participants felt comfortable to talk, and therefore, there were many expansions.

40|$|This study aimed firstly to {{establish}} the distribution and copy number within the Burkholderia cepacia complex of three <b>insertion</b> <b>sequences</b> (IS 402, IS 407 and IS 1416) that possess the ability to activate transcription and hence influence gene expression. A second aim was to map the genomic insertion sites {{of one of the}} active <b>insertion</b> <b>sequences</b> (IS 407) {{to establish}} putative links between insertion site and downstream gene activation. The resulting data revealed that all three <b>insertion</b> <b>sequences</b> were present in one-third of the 66 isolates tested. The three <b>insertion</b> <b>sequences</b> were prevalent across the nine B. cepacia complex species, although IS 402 was absent from the 16 Burkholderia anthina strains tested and IS 407 was absent from all 10 Burkholderia pyrrocinia strains. IS 407 copies from six strains (two Burkholderia cenocepacia strains and one strain each of Burkholderia multivorans, Burkholderia stabilis, Burkholderia vietnamiensis and B. anthina) were mapped to the genome using hemi-nested inverse PCR. Insertions were found upstream of genes with wide-ranging functions. This study suggests that the abundance and distribution of these active <b>insertion</b> <b>sequences</b> is likely to affect genomic plasticity, and potentially gene transcription and pathogenicity. 7484...|$|R

This was successfully demonstrated using recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing influenza proteins, but the principle should also be applicable to DNA vaccines.

25|$|Initially, the DNA of {{interest}} {{needs to be}} isolated to provide a DNA segment of suitable size. Subsequently, a ligation procedure is used where the amplified fragment is inserted into a vector (piece of DNA). The vector (which is frequently circular) is linearised using restriction enzymes, and incubated with the fragment {{of interest}} under appropriate conditions with an enzyme called DNA ligase. Following ligation the vector with the insert of interest is transfected into cells. A number of alternative techniques are available, such as chemical sensitivation of cells, electroporation, optical injection and biolistics. Finally, the transfected cells are cultured. As the aforementioned procedures are of particularly low efficiency, {{there is a need}} to identify the cells that have been successfully transfected with the vector construct containing the desired <b>insertion</b> <b>sequence</b> in the required orientation. Modern cloning vectors include selectable antibiotic resistance markers, which allow only cells in which the vector has been transfected, to grow. Additionally, the cloning vectors may contain colour selection markers, which provide blue/white screening (alpha-factor complementation) on X-gal medium. Nevertheless, these selection steps do not absolutely guarantee that the DNA insert is present in the cells obtained. Further investigation of the resulting colonies must be required to confirm that cloning was successful. This may be accomplished by means of PCR, restriction fragment analysis and/or DNA sequencing.|$|E

This sequence {{has been called the}} ribosomal insertion [Wellauer, P. K. & Dawid, I. B. (1977) Cell 10, 193 - 212]. We report here that members of the same sequence family occur outside the ribosomal locus. “Non-rDNA insertion DNA” was separated from rDNA by density gradient centrifugation, and sequences homologous to the ribosomal insertion were detected by hybridization with restriction endonuclease fragments derived from a cloned rDNA repeating unit. Pure <b>insertion</b> <b>sequences</b> from cloned rDNA separated from main band DNA and behaved like a component with high G + C content.

50|$|An <b>insertion</b> <b>{{sequence}}</b> (also {{known as}} an IS, an <b>insertion</b> <b>sequence</b> element, or an IS element) is a short DNA sequence {{that acts as a}} simple transposable element. Insertion sequences have two major characteristics: they are small relative to other transposable elements (generally around 700 to 2500 bp in length) and only code for proteins implicated in the transposition activity (they are thus different from other transposons, which also carry accessory genes such as antibiotic resistance genes). These proteins are usually the transposase which catalyses the enzymatic reaction allowing the IS to move, and also one regulatory protein which either stimulates or inhibits the transposition activity. The coding region in an <b>insertion</b> <b>sequence</b> is usually flanked by inverted repeats. For example, the well-known IS911 (1250 bp) is flanked by two 36bp inverted repeat extremities and the coding region has two genes partially overlapping orfA and orfAB, coding the transposase (OrfAB) and a regulatory protein (OrfA). A particular <b>insertion</b> <b>sequence</b> may be named according to the form ISn, where n is a number (e.g. IS1, IS2, IS3, IS10, IS50, IS911, IS26 etc.); this is not the only naming scheme used, however. Although insertion sequences are usually discussed in the context of prokaryotic genomes, certain eukaryotic DNA sequences belonging to the family of Tc1/mariner transposable elements may be considered to be, insertion sequences.|$|E

The data include 1173 occurrences of six unrelated <b>insertion</b> <b>sequences</b> (IS 1, IS 2, IS 3, IS 4, IS 5 and IS 30). The number of insertion elements per strain, and the sizes of DNA restriction fragments containing them, is highly variable and can be used to discriminate even among closely related strains. The occurrence and abundance of pairs of unrelated <b>insertion</b> <b>sequences</b> are apparently statistically independent, but significant correlations result from stratifications in the {{reference collection}}. However, there is a highly significant positive association among the <b>insertion</b> <b>sequences</b> considered in the aggregate. Nine branching process models, which differ in assumptions regarding the regulation of transposition and the effect of copy number on fitness, have been evaluated with regard to their fit of the observed distributions. No single model fits all copy number distributions. The best models incorporate no regulation of transposition and a moderate to strong decrease in fitness with increasing copy number for IS 1 and IS 5, strong regulation of transposition and a negligible to weak decrease in fitness with increasing copy number for IS 3, and less than strong regulation of transposition for IS 2, IS 4 and IS 30...|$|R

In addition to full-length copies, {{a large number of}} internal deletion variants have been identified. ISSoc 2 has two variants (ISSoc 2 - 1 and ISSoc 2 - 2) that are observed to have multiple near-exact copies. Comparison of environmental metagenomic sequences to the Synechococcus genomes reveals novel placement of copies of ISSoc 2, ISSoc 2 - 1, and ISSoc 2 - 2. Thus, ISSoc 2 - 1 and ISSoc 2 - 2 appear to be active nonautonomous mobile elements derived by internal deletion from ISSoc 2. Insertion sites interrupting genes that are likely critical for cell viabil-ity were detected; however, most insertions either were intergenic or were within genes of unknown function. Most novel inser-tions detected in the metagenome were rare, suggesting a stringent selective environment.

40|$|International audienceDuring {{evolution}} of microorganisms genomes underwork have different {{changes in their}} lengths, gene orders, and gene contents. Investigating these structural rearrangements helps to understand how genomes have been modified over time. Some elements that {{play an important role}} in genome rearrangements are called <b>insertion</b> <b>sequences</b> (ISs), they are the simplest types of transposable elements (TEs) that widely spread within prokaryotic genomes. ISs can be defined as DNA segments that have the ability to move (cut and paste) themselves to another location within the same chromosome or not.
