His mother Prema wants to search for him, but is told it is too dangerous. Suresh is rescued from Sabre the Leopard by the elephant Bono and the monkey Mantoo, and he is given the ability to communicate with the animals. Bono informs the animals present that Sabre has hunted on the Night of Deva and for Sabre to be brought to him. When Sabre appears and Bono scolds him for violating the no <b>hunting</b> <b>rule</b> that occurs on the Night of Deva, Sabre states that he will come for the boy when he is old enough to defend himself. Suresh is named [...] "Manling" [...] and raised by the forest creatures where Bono ends up training the Manling to defend himself {{when it comes to the}} day when he has to fight Sabre.|$|E

The profitability of forestry began to be appreciated in the 15 th and the 16 th century. Many instructions regulating the protection of forests were issued in this period. The forests were in an alarming state, exhausted and without wood reserves till the 18 th century. The forest law underwent the biggest development under the rule of Maria Terezia and Joseph II. The most important legal regulation in that period was the <b>hunting</b> <b>rule</b> from the year 1754. The biggest break in the development of hunting law was brought by the patent No. 54 / 1849 i. a. of the emperor Frank Joseph I. in 1849. The monarch cancelled the nobility's right of hunting in other people's holdings by means of this patent.
