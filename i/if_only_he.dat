5|$|Gandhi's assassin Godse made {{no attempt}} to escape and was seized by the witnesses. He was arrested. In the weeks that followed, his {{collaborators}} were arrested as well. Godse was a Hindu nationalist with links to the extremist Hindu Mahasabha. They were tried in court at Delhi's Red Fort. At his trial, Godse did not deny the charges nor express any remorse. According to Claude Markovits, a French historian noted for his studies of colonial India, Godse stated that he killed Gandhi because of his complacence towards Muslims, holding Gandhi responsible for the frenzy of violence and sufferings during the subcontinent's partition into Pakistan and India. Godse accused Gandhi of subjectivism and of acting as <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>he</b> had a monopoly of the truth. Godse was found guilty and executed in 1949.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{a general}} {{relationship}} between risk and time preferences. I consider a decision maker who chooses a one-time consumption. I assume however, {{that he believes}} both that today’s good is certain, and that, as the promised date for future goods becomes increasingly distant, the probability of his consuming the goods decreases continuously to zero. For example, the probability might be the subjective mortality rate of a decision maker or the objective hazard rate of future goods. Under the assumptions specified above, the present paper shows that (i) a decision maker exhibits the common ratio effect <b>if</b> and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> discounts hyperbolically; (ii) he exhibits the certainty effect <b>if</b> and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> discounts quasi-hyperbolically; and (iii) he exhibits the expected utility <b>if</b> and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> is temporally unbiased (an exponential discounter) ...|$|R

Aiming to kill Ali, Ibn Muljam headed toward Kufa where {{he fell in love with}} a woman whose brother and father had died at Nahrawan. She agreed to marry him <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>he</b> could kill Ali. Consequently, Ali was stabbed by Ibn Muljam at the Great Mosque of Kufa.

On the first day of his flight Gonsales encounters [...] "illusions of 'Devils and Wicked Spirits in the shape of men and women, some of whom he is able to converse with.

He is soon discovered by the inhabitants of the Moon, the Lunars, whom he finds to be tall Christian people enjoying a happy and carefree life in a kind of pastoral paradise. Gonsales discovers that order is maintained in this apparently utopian state by swapping delinquent children with terrestrial children.|$|E
500|$|Sandra {{normally}} {{went out}} with her boyfriend, John Hankins, on Thursday nights, but had decided to change her night off and thus, had seen him the previous day. The two last spoke on the telephone at about 8:00pm on 7November. After putting the younger children to bed, at about 8:55pm she asked Veronica if she would like a cup of tea, before heading downstairs to the basement kitchen to make one. As she entered the room, she was bludgeoned {{to death with a}} piece of bandaged lead pipe. Her killer then placed her body into a canvas mailsack. Meanwhile, wondering what had delayed her nanny, Lady Lucan descended from the first floor to see what had happened. She called to Rivett {{from the top of the}} basement stairs and was herself attacked. As she screamed for her life, her attacker told her to [...] "shut up". Lady Lucan later claimed at that moment to have recognised her husband's voice. The two apparently continued to fight; she bit his fingers, and when he threw her face down to the carpet, managed to turn around and squeeze his testicles, causing him to release his grip on her throat and give up the fight. When she asked where Rivett was, Lucan was at first evasive, but eventually admitted to having killed her. Terrified, Lady Lucan told him she could help him escape <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>he</b> would remain at the house for a few days, to allow her injuries to heal. Lucan walked upstairs and sent his daughter to bed, then went into one of the bedrooms. When Veronica entered, to lie on the bed, he told her to put towels down first to avoid staining the bedding. Lucan asked her if she had any barbiturates and went to the bathroom to get a wet towel, supposedly to clean Veronica's face. Lady Lucan realised her husband would be unable to hear her from the bathroom, and made her escape, running outside to a nearby public house, the Plumbers Arms.|$|E

2500|$|In 1782, the {{director}} of the Opéra, Antoine Dauvergne, was forced to resign his post and the management of the theatre was assumed by the artists acting as a kind of cooperative. The results were so disastrous that the former director had to be recalled in April 1785, although even then his relationship with the trio of rebel singers did not improve very much. In a report to his superiors, Dauvergne described Lays as the black sheep of the group, Rousseau as a [...] "nice young man", <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>he</b> had spent less time in the company of Lays, and Chéron as another [...] "nice young man" [...] (with the mind of a twelve-year-old), but scared of the beating Lays and Rousseau had promised him if he betrayed their alliance.

2500|$|As {{they split}} up Regina and Robin are being {{followed}} by a resident (the person that Regina choked back in the Enchanted Forest), who leads them to Cora, who is {{the mayor of the}} Underworld Storybrooke. Cora offers Regina a way out, telling her she has one hour to leave on the ferry with Henry and Robin. She then takes Regina to a ledge over the Phlegethon, the River of Fire. She threatens to send Regina's father to a worse place if Regina does not comply, and she uses her messenger as an example by sending him off into the flames. Around the same time, Mary Margaret enters a Underworld version of Granny's and is recognized by the Blind Witch by her smell, and is then encountered by David wearing different clothes and proceeds to kiss her, as she realizes it's James, who is the [...] "Sheriff" [...] in this world. Gold goes to the Underworld version of his pawn shop and encounters his father Malcolm, whose soul must live as Peter Pan. Knowing already what Gold wants, Pan is willing to make a deal with no strings attached. However, he urges Gold to leave the Underworld, telling him that the others aren't his real friends, but Gold ignores his plea, accepting some sort of potion. Pan ominously adds that he himself would be able to leave, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>he</b> could trade places with a living soul, although Gold refuses this. As everyone meets up again, Regina tells the others about Cora's warning, while Gold gives Emma the potion he obtained, which is from DunBroch, and can be used to summon the dead by pouring it over someone's grave. Gold explains {{it can be used to}} summon Hook and ask him where he is, but will not join them as he has decided that he is returning to Storybrooke.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the federalist}} forces in open disarray and the polls {{showing that the}} yes side was going to win, Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin {{suggested}} organizing a gigantic [...] "unity rally" [...] in Montreal. Most of the Cabinet was opposed to Tobin's idea, but Chrétien decided to support the rally, telling Tobin at the Cabinet meeting [...] "Brian-Go!" [...] Chrétien's chief of staff Jean Pelletier later recalled that [...] "We muscled in" [...] on leading the no forces as Johnson, the nominal leader of the no committee {{was considered to be}} an inept leader who would lose the referendum on his own. Facing defeat, Chrétien did an U-turn on the question of a [...] "distinct society", saying in a speech on October 24 in Verdun that the federal government was now open to the idea of recognizing Quebec as a [...] "distinct society" [...] in the constitution. In a speech before the Liberal caucus on October 25, Chrétien acknowledged openly the possibility of defeat, and lashed out at the Quebec media whom he accused of pushing [...] "a big pile of shit" [...] that was allowing the yes side to win people over, and suggested that he might resign if the oui side won. On October 26, 1995, Montreal radio station disk jockey Pierre Brassard telephoned Queen Elizabeth II pretending to be Chrétien; he discussed the pending referendum, but also rambled about odd subjects, such as what the Queen would be wearing for Halloween and placing her effigy on Canadian Tire money. The Queen later said to Chrétien: [...] "I didn't think you sounded quite like yourself, but I thought, given all the duress you were under, you might have been drunk." [...] The result of Tobin's efforts was the Unity Rally of October 27, 1995, when 100,000 people showed up. On the night of the referendum, the prospect of a victory for the yes side was considered to be so realistic that Defence Minister David Collenette ordered the military to begin contingency plans to defend federal property in Quebec from a separatist take-over should the yes side prevail. On October 30, 1995, the federalist no side won by the narrowest of margins. Chrétien blamed the narrow victory on the Quebec Liberals under Johnson, whom he claimed had betrayed him, and argued the federalists would have done much better <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>he</b> had intervened in the referendum earlier, and presented the no case in terms of Trudeau-style [...] "hard federalism" [...] instead of the [...] "soft federalist" [...] no case presented by Johnson, which depicted the benefits of Confederation in purely economic terms, and had a strongly nationalist, albeit federalist tone of language.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 October 1946, Raeder {{was found}} guilty of {{conspiracy}} against the peace, conspiracy to commit aggression, and war crimes. Raeder expected a death sentence, and was deeply shocked when he received life imprisonment, which he regarded as a worse punishment than execution, complaining that as an old man spending {{the rest of his life}} in prison would be unbearable. Raeder formally asked the International Military Tribunal to be executed by firing squad instead, only to be informed that the Tribunal did not have the powers to change its sentence. At Spandau Prison, Raeder spent his days working in the prison library. When not working in the library, Raeder spent his time debating with the prison chaplain, the French Pastor Georges Casalis who believed that Raeder's soul might be saved if he confessed his guilt, and tried hard to save Raeder. Raeder for his part did not believe he was guilty of anything, and he rejected Casalis's attempts to save his soul. When not debating questions of guilt with Casalis, Raeder spent his free time continuing his war-time feud with Karl Dönitz. Dönitz was savage in his relentless attacks against Raeder for his [...] "policy of bloated surface vessels" [...] and for not spending enough money on building U-boats in the 1930s, a policy that Dönitz claimed had cost him victory in the Battle of the Atlantic. Dönitz told the former Foreign Minister Konstantin von Neurath that [...] "It had been Raeder's fault that until the middle of 1940 only two U-boats slid down the ways" [...] per month, and that <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>he</b> had been Navy Commander-in-Chief in 1940 then he would have won the war. In 1951, Dönitz learned that a British historian had written if only Germany had a larger U-boat fleet in 1939, then Dönitz might have won the Atlantic campaign, leading Dönitz to announce that once he was free, he would repeat that judgement [...] "in the full light of publicity" [...] to ruin Raeder's reputation once and for all. When not blaming each other for losing the Battle of the Atlantic, the two admirals fought over status. The authoritarian Raeder still continued to behave as if he was Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, and expected Dönitz to behave like a subordinate who only existed to take orders, a position that Dönitz utterly rejected. Dönitz was also a Grand Admiral, making him Raeder's equal, and he fiercely resented Raeder's patronising, condescending attitude. Because Hitler had appointed Dönitz his successor in his last will and testament, well into the 1950s the Nationalist Socialist fanatic Dönitz continued to insist that he was still President of Germany, and that the NSDAP should still be the only legal party in Germany. Since in his own mind, he was still Germany's leader, Dönitz saw himself as Raeder's superior, and expected Raeder to be his subordinate.|$|E
