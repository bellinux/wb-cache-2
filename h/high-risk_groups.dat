5|$|The {{specific}} type of postremission therapy is individualized based on a person's prognostic factors (see above) and general health. For good-prognosis leukemias (i.e. inv(16), t(8;21), and t(15;17)), people will typically undergo an additional three to five courses of intensive chemotherapy, known as consolidation chemotherapy. For people {{at high risk of}} relapse (e.g. those with high-risk cytogenetics, underlying MDS, or therapy-related AML), allogeneic stem cell transplantation is usually recommended if the person is able to tolerate a transplant and has a suitable donor. The best postremission therapy for intermediate-risk AML (normal cytogenetics or cytogenetic changes not falling into good-risk or <b>high-risk</b> <b>groups)</b> is less clear and depends on the specific situation, including the age and overall health of the person, the person's values, and whether a suitable stem cell donor is available.|$|E
5|$|Personal traits such as age, gender, location, and {{education}} correlate, either positively or negatively, with HIV/AIDS awareness levels. For example, older women have demonstrated {{higher levels of}} knowledge regarding HIV/AIDS than younger women in Malawi. Because men typically have greater access to education and other social resources, they are often more knowledgeable about HIV prevention and transmission than women. While men are, on average, able to list 2.2 ways to prevent HIV transmission, women are only able to list 1.5 ways. Only 38% of women surveyed in 2003-2004 understood that their husbands {{would be less likely}} to contract HIV if they used condoms during intercourse with prostitutes and other women from <b>high-risk</b> <b>groups.</b> In addition, men who are raised in urban environments are, on average, more informed about HIV/AIDS than men who are raised in rural environments, presumably because urban children typically have greater access to educational resources than rural children. Among both men and women, higher levels of education correspond to increased knowledge about HIV/AIDS: men and women who have received secondary school educations are significantly more likely to understand complex aspects of the disease, such as the fact that people who appear healthy can still be HIV-positive, than those who have not. Finally, people who have lost friends or family members to the disease are likely to have greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS due to their personal, firsthand exposure to the problem.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: This study {{aimed to}} {{describe}} national trends in presentation, management, and outcomes for men with high risk prostate cancer. Methods: Data were abstracted from CaPSURE; 10, 808 men were diagnosed between 1990 and 2007 and had complete clinical data. High-risk was defined {{according to the}} D'Amico criteria; a more restrictive definition assigned clinical stage T 2 c to intermediate rather than high risk. Temporal trends were assessed for patient distribution among risk groups, and within the <b>high-risk</b> <b>group</b> for individual risk factors, Kattan nomogram score, Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score, and primary treatment. Survival analysis stratified by CAPRA score was performed. Results: Under the standard definition, 31. 2 % {{of the men were}} diagnosed with high-risk disease, and 16. 9 % were high-risk under the restrictive definition. This proportion has fallen over time but has been stable since 2000. Patients who would be stratified to high risk under the standard definition and to intermediate risk under the restrictive definition have better outcomes than those stratified to either intermediate or high risk under both definitions. There has been no consistent risk migration within the <b>high-risk</b> <b>group</b> over time. Treatment varies substantially with CAPRA score within the <b>high-risk</b> <b>group,</b> with higher risk men less likely to receive local therapy. Use of androgen deprivation therapy has increased over time, both as primary therapy and in conjunction with both external beam radiation and brachytherapy. Biochemical outcomes vary according to CAPRA score within the <b>high-risk</b> <b>group.</b> Conclusions: Clinical stage T 2 c should not define high risk, and the <b>high-risk</b> <b>group</b> should be substratified using a multivariable instrument. There is no evidence for meaningful downward risk migration among high-risk patients over the past 15 years. At least some men in the <b>high-risk</b> <b>group</b> may be undertreated. © Springer-Verlag 2008...|$|R

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} are to {{validate}} follicular lymphoma international prognostic index (FLIPI) prognostic score and to compare it with the international prognostic index (IPI) in a cohort of 57 Brazilian patients. According to IPI, 24 patients (42 %) were in the low-risk, 28 (49 %) in the intermediate-risk, and 4 (7 %) in the <b>high-risk</b> <b>group.</b> the distribution according to FLIPI was: 20 (35 %) in the low-risk, 8 (14 %) in the intermediate-risk, and 29 (51 %) in the <b>high-risk</b> <b>group.</b> According to IPI score, median OS was not reached for the low-risk, it was 45 months for the intermediate-risk and 25 months for the <b>high-risk</b> <b>group</b> (p < 0. 001). When FLIPI score was applied, median OS was not reached for the low and intermediate-risk, and was 42 months for the <b>high-risk</b> <b>group</b> (p = 0. 0064). These findings suggest that: (1) FLIPI score could be validated in a Brazilian population; (2) FLIPI is more accurate than IPI to identify FL patients having worse prognosis (51 %); (3) IPI seems to be a better tool for clinical decisions because it selected a smaller <b>high-risk</b> <b>group</b> (7 %) having worse prognosis. in our opinion, IPI high-risk patients are the real candidates for more aggressive therapies, avoiding unnecessary over-treatment.

25|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of testing infrastructure has been largely prompted {{by the introduction of}} provider-initiated routine testing campaigns to identify infected individuals and put them in contact with treatment services. Client-initiated testing was failing to identify most infected individuals, so campaigns to screen <b>high-risk</b> <b>groups,</b> including drug users, commercial sex workers, prisoners, and former plasma donors, were commissioned to link patients to treatment services. The campaigns have resulted in a substantial {{increase in the number of}} individuals who know their HIV status, with an additional 60,000 people living with HIV/AIDS identified. This increased identification explains, at least in part, the rapid rise in reported HIV cases in the early 21st century.

25|$|While current {{technology}} is very effective at detecting smoke and fire conditions, the deaf and {{hard of hearing}} community has raised concerns {{about the effectiveness of}} the alerting function in awakening sleeping individuals in certain <b>high-risk</b> <b>groups</b> such as the elderly, those with hearing loss and those who are intoxicated. Between 2005 and 2007 research sponsored by the United States' National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) focused on understanding the cause of the higher number of deaths in such <b>high-risk</b> <b>groups.</b> Initial research into the effectiveness of the various alerting methods is sparse. Research findings suggest that a low frequency (520Hz) square wave output is significantly more effective at awakening high risk individuals. Wireless smoke and carbon monoxide detectors linked to alert mechanisms such as vibrating pillow pads for the hearing impaired, strobes, and remote warning handsets are more effective at waking people with serious hearing loss than other alarms.|$|E

SETTING: Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, Siena University, Siena, Italy. PATIENT(S) : One hundred sixty-three women seeking postcoital contraception. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Data on menstrual history {{and time of}} unprotected intercourse were recorded. Ultrasonographic variables evaluated were ovarian follicle or corpus luteum diameter, endometrial echopattern and thickness, and peritoneal fluid volume. Expected pregnancy rates were calculated according to the probability of conception as estimated from Dixon's table of data, based solely on anamnestic data, or from endometrial or ovarian findings on transvaginal ultrasonography. RESULT(S) : According to the menstrual history (cut-off level < 0. 03) we expected to find 7. 6 pregnancies (7. 9 in the <b>high-risk</b> <b>group</b> and 0. 31 in the low-risk group). According to transvaginal ultrasonography (at the same cut-off), we expected 11. 2 pregnancies (0. 3 in the low-risk group and 10. 9 in the <b>high-risk</b> <b>group).</b> No more than 7 pregnancies were observed, all of which occurred in the <b>high-risk</b> <b>group</b> as determined by transvaginal ultrasonography.
