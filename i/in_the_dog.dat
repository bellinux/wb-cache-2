5|$|According to the Columbia Animal Hospital the {{frequency}} of affected animals is dogs, humans, pigs, horses, cattle, chickens, and turkeys, and in dogs the most commonly affected breeds include the German Shepherd, Golden and Labrador Retriever, Rottweiler, Great Dane, Bernese Mountain Dog, and Saint Bernard. Although any joint may be affected, those commonly affected by OCD <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> are: shoulder (often bilaterally), elbow, knee and tarsus.|$|E
5|$|On {{a longer}} timescale, animals like the Arctic hare, Arctic fox, stoat, and rock {{ptarmigan}} have snow camouflage, changing their coat colour (by moulting and growing new fur or feathers) from brown or grey {{in the summer}} to white in the winter; the Arctic fox is the only species <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> family to do so. However, Arctic hares which live in the far north of Canada, where summer is very short, remain white year-round.|$|E
5|$|Some {{animals of}} the far north, like the showshoe and Arctic hares, Arctic fox, stoat, and rock {{ptarmigan}} change their coat colour (by moulting and growing new fur or feathers) from brown or grey summer camouflage to white in the winter; the Arctic fox is the only species <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> family to do so. However, Arctic hares which live in the far north of Canada, where summer is very short, remain white year-round. Since these animals in widely separated groups have evolved separately, the similarity of coloration is due to convergent evolution, on the presumption that natural selection favours a particular coloration in a particular environment.|$|E
40|$|Using dogs such as ones spontaneously {{infected}} with hookworms, ones dewormed of these hookworms, those experimentally {{infected with}} hookworms showing marked intestinal hemorrhage {{as well as}} normal <b>dogs</b> (<b>the</b> control), and orally administering them radioactive iron, Fe(59), the author determined <b>the</b> radioactive iron <b>in</b> erythrocytes and plasm periodically. Then 48 hours later perfusion is given and fractionating the visceral iron by Yoneyama-Konno's method, the iron contents and Fe(59) are estimated. As the results, {{it has been found}} that the iron-absorption rate is lowest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> spontaneously infected with hookworms, followed in an ascending order of normal dogs and dewormed <b>dogs,</b> and highest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> with experimental hookworm disease. As for the distribution of Fe(59) absorbed, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spontaneously infected <b>dogs</b> it is distributed mostly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> liver, spleen and bone marrow, demonstrating an extremely low portion of it taken into erythrocytes. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> dewormed <b>dogs,</b> on <b>the</b> contrary, the major portion of the absorbed Fe(59) is taken up by erythrocytes and it is sparsely distributed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> liver, spleen and bone marrow, and this tendency is still more marked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> with experimental hookworm disease, Furthermore, the iron contents of various organs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> spontaneously infected with hookworms, though slightly less than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> normal, are greater than those found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dewormed <b>dogs,</b> proving a marked decrease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> with experimental hookworm disease. From these data it is assumed that there is a definite impediment to the absorption and mobilization of iron in hookworm disease and that such an impediment together with hemorrhage induce anemia...|$|R

5|$|On its formation, the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles {{took over}} the running of a regular show at Peterborough that had started in 1889, and the Beagle Club in the UK held its first show in 1896. The regular showing of the breed led to the {{development}} of a uniform type, and the beagle continued to prove a success up until the outbreak of World War I when all shows were suspended. After the war, the breed was again struggling for survival in the UK: the last of the Pocket Beagles was probably lost during this time, and registrations fell to an all-time low. A few breeders (notably Reynalton Kennels) managed to revive interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> and by World War II, the breed was once again doing well.

25|$|There {{are four}} {{important}} layers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> and cat cornea. The outer layer is the epithelium, which is 25 to 40 micrometers and {{five to seven}} cell layers thick. The epithelium holds the tear film in place and also prevents water from invading the cornea and disrupting the collagen fibers. This prevents corneal edema, which gives it a cloudy appearance. It is also a barrier to infectious agents. The epithelium sticks to the basement membrane, which also separates the epithelium from the stroma. The corneal stroma comprises 90 percent of {{the thickness of the}} cornea. It contains the collagen fibers organized into lamellae. The lamellae are in sheets which separate easily. Posterior to the stroma is Descemet's membrane, which is a basement membrane for the corneal endothelium. The endothelium is a single cell layer that separates the cornea from the aqueous humor.|$|E
