40|$|Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is a neurobiological {{disorder}} {{commonly known}} with the acronym ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). Because ADHD can influence on children’s basic daily activities and so limiting their normal development {{it is very}} important that we have the knowledge to face with these disturbance and by so helping the children to manage their problems that are mostly reflected in their interaction with the environment. The most stressful and emotionally <b>exhausting</b> <b>period</b> of time for the children with ADHD and their parents is engaging in formal education institutions. Education institutions with properly educated teachers can provide a suitable environment for the children with ADHD and so helping them to manage their disorder. Research gave me the insights on the problem of integration of children with ADHD into classes on the elementary education level and also the insights on how teachers addressed their problem. Research was based on the online questionnaire that was send to the teacher across Slovenian educational institutions that had some experiences in dealing with children with ADHD. Research focused mainly on the role of teachers and their ability to percept children’s behavioral characteristics and their needs, adaptation of educational process, teachers support as children’s manages their problem, teacher’s cooperation with children’s parents and general integration of troubled children into social environment. Based on the research most of the teachers are greatly aware of their role in the integration of the children with ADHD into teaching process and class group. Participants of the research had shown great significant degree in recognition of behavior characteristic of children with ADHD. Behavior characteristics that were most often detected by the teachers were restlessness, mood and emotional swings, rate of attention and other signs. Teachers are generally aware of the needs of the children with ADHD and they adapt their lessons so this children can be included in a way that they can express their strong areas and interests. Teachers are also aware of the importance of the cooperation with the experts and with parents of a child with ADHD. As reported from teachers the most difficult area for this children is social inclusion which is a consequence of their improper behavior and could be solved with the rise of awareness for ADHD between other children. Regarding of self-evaluation of their abilities to cope with the children with the ADHD teachers have reported that they are partly qualified and that most of their qualification was gained by work but it would not be invade to gain some more experiences. ...|$|E
40|$|Da omdømmekampanjen «For alt vi har. Og alt vi er» ble lansert, hevdet Forsvarssjefen det var «… på bakgrunn av en likegyldighet i befolkningen til Forsvaret», han ville synliggjøre innsatsforsvarets relevans. Imidlertid ble kampanjen lansert i en tid hvor alle offentlige organisasjoner med respekt for seg selv er blitt klar over at de har et omdømme, og bør jobbe strategisk for å forbedre det. Slik kan kampanjen forstås som et uttrykk for at Forsvaret er preget av en av de siste 20 årenes dominerende trender for organisasjonsutforming, og dermed undersøkes i lys av det såkalte myteperspektivet. På den annen side kan det foreligge mer spesifikke, substansielle årsaker til at kampanjen ble lansert. I 2011 var Forsvaret ved slutten av en langvarig og omfattende omstillingsperiode. Leirer var lagt ned, antall vernepliktige og ansatte redusert. Færre kjente Forsvaret. Det hadde vært kjedelige episoder med korrupsjonsmistanker og dårlig økonomisk kontroll. Styrkebidraget til Afghanistan hadde formet både Forsvaret og befolkningens inntrykk av det, gjennom ti år. Krigerkulturen var debattert, blant annet etter utsagn om at «krig er bedre enn sex». Slike forhold gjør det naturlig å studere omdømmekampanjen ut fra instrumentelle og kulturelle perspektiver. Problemstillingen hvorfor lanserte Forsvaret sin omdømmekampanje? ble utgangspunkt for en kvalitativ tilnærming. Data er samlet inn ved dokumentstudier og intervjuer, og analysert ut fra operasjonalisert teori. Resultatene viser at «For alt vi har. Og alt vi er» ikke var alt. Forsvaret lanserte omdømme-kampanjen som et tiltak i et nytt og helhetlig kommunikasjonskonsept. Hensikten var å kommunisere bedre med befolkningen. Organisasjonen ville forklare «hvem Forsvaret er, hva Forsvaret gjør og hvorfor Forsvaret gjør det de gjør». Omdømmekampanjen skulle vekke oppmerksomhet, og gi det norske folk en grunn til å lytte på det Forsvaret hadde å fortelle. Konseptet ble utformet i samsvar med myteperspektivets omdømmeoppskrift, men både prosessen og resultatet er vel så sterkt preget av forklaringsfaktorer knyttet til de to andre perspektivene. Omdømmekampanjen synliggjør omdømmeparadokset; at organisasjoner skal fremstå med unikt særpreg, eller konkurransefortrinn, samtidig som de appellerer til allianser med bredere lag av interessenter og viser at de etterlever allmenne verdier. Det ser ut til at Forsvaret har klart å forene hensyn til både substans og fremtreden i sin omdømmeorientering, og så langt funnet sin plass i (om) dømmesamfunnet. «For all we have. And all we are» Was that all? On the Background of the Norwegian Armed Forces’ Reputation Campaign When the Norwegian {{armed forces}} {{launched}} its reputation campaign “For all we have. And all we are”, the Chief of defence claimed {{the reason was}} that the population seemed indifferent. He wanted to attract attention to {{the relevance of the}} restructured forces. However, the campaign was launched at a time when all public offices with respect to themselves had become aware that they have a reputation, and that they should manage it carefully. Hence the campaign could express that the armed forces are characterized by one of the last 20 years dominant trends in organizational design, and may be examined {{in the light of the}} so-called myth perspective. On the other hand, there might be more specific, substantial reasons behind the launching of the reputation campaign. In 2011 the armed forces were at the end of a long-lasting and <b>exhausting</b> <b>period</b> of restructuring and modernization. Camps had been closed down, the numbers of conscripts and employees were reduced. Consequently, few were familiar with the forces. Poor financial control was reported quite frequently, and suspicion that some servants were corrupt had been raised. Through a decade, contribution to the campaign in Afghanistan had shaped both the forces and the public's perceptions of them. Warrior culture had been debated, partly as a consequence of statements like "war is better than sex". Such features invite to study the reputation campaign from instrumental and cultural perspectives. The research question Why did the armed forces launch its reputation campaign? formed the basis of a qualitative approach. Collection of data has been achieved through document studies and interviews, analysis in accordance with operationalized theory. The results show that "For all we have. And all we are" wasn’t all. The reputation campaign was a part of the forces’ new, comprehensive concept of communication, primarily aiming to communicate better with the public. The purpose of the campaign was to make the public more observant of the forces’ communication. The concept was designed in accordance with the reputation recipe and relates to the myth perspective, but is obviously influenced by factors that correspond with the instrumental and cultural perspectives. The reputation campaign highlights the paradox of reputation management; organizations should emerge with unique character, or competitive advantage, while simultaneously appealing to most stakeholders and demonstrate that they comply with general, contemporary values.

40|$|Cylinder scavenging, {{negative}} PMEP {{and knock}} sensitivity at high engine speeds {{are some of}} the main challenges facing downsized turbocharged SI engines, while torque deficiency is more of a problem related to engines under low speed conditions. Traditional downsized engine can currently only address the above problems within a very small window inevitably leaving the other situation compromised which would either affect fuel efficiency or engine power. In order to simultaneously enhance the already competitive advantages while mitigating inherent deficiencies of turbocharged engines, some novel techniques need to be investigated. Divided <b>Exhaust</b> <b>Period</b> (DEP) is such a gas exchange concept where two exhaust ports from each cylinder are separated into different manifolds. The blow-down pulse is directed through one valve that leads to the turbocharger in order to boost the intake charge, while the other valve path (termed scavenge valve) bypasses the turbine to scavenge the remainder of the exhaust. By combining the characteristics of the downsized turbocharged engine and the scavenging process of a more-normal naturally aspirated engine, both the torque performance and the gas exchange process could be enhanced. In this paper, the DEP concept will be investigated in simulation using a validated highly downsized 2. 0 Litre SI engine model. The final results showed that the BMEP & transient performance, BSFC and the stability of the engine were all improved {{due to the fact that}} the DEP concept features better gas exchange process and improved combustion efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Fuel {{efficiency}} and torque performance {{are two major}} challenges for highly downsized turbocharged engines. However, the inherent characteristics of the turbocharged SI engine such as negative PMEP, knock sensitivity and poor transient performance significantly limit its maximum potential. Conventional ways of improving the problems above normally concentrate solely on the engine side or turbocharger side leaving the exhaust manifold in between ignored. This paper investigates this neglected area by highlighting a novel means of gas exchange process. Divided <b>Exhaust</b> <b>Period</b> (DEP) is an alternative way of accomplishing the gas exchange process in turbocharged engines. The DEP concept engine features two exhaust valves but with separated function. The blow-down valve acts like a traditional turbocharged exhaust valve to evacuate the first portion of the exhaust gas to the turbine. While the scavenge valve feeding the latter portion of the exhaust gas directly into the low resistant exhaust pipe behaves similarly to valves in a naturally aspirated engine. By combining the characteristics of both turbocharged and naturally aspirated engines, high backpressure between the turbine inlet and the exhaust port is maintained in the blowdown phase while significant reduction of the backpressure could be achieved in the latter displacement phase. This is directly beneficial for pumping work and residual gas scavenging. Combustion phasing & stability and turbocharger efficiency could also benefit from such concept. This simulation study was carried out using a validated 1 D model of a highly downsized SI engine. Two degrees of freedom including the lift and {{the duration of the}} scavenge valve were optimized to achieve minimum BSFC. The potential for higher attainable BMEP was also briefly investigated at low engine speed...|$|R
40|$|The Divided <b>Exhaust</b> <b>Period</b> (DEP) {{concept is}} an {{approach}} {{which has been}} proved to significantly reduce the averaged back pressure of turbocharged engines whilst still improving its combustion phasing. The standard layout of the DEP system comprises of two separately-functioned exhaust valves with one valve feeding the blow-down pulse to the turbine whilst the other valve targeting the scavenging behaviour by bypassing the turbine. Via combining the characteristics of both turbocharged engines and naturally aspirated engines, this method can provide large BSFC improvement. The DEP concept has only been applied to single-stage turbocharged engines so far. However, it in its basic form {{is in no way}} restricted to a single-stage system. This paper, for the first time, will apply DEP concept to a regulated two-stage (R 2 S) downsized SI engine. By controlling the timing of the exhaust valves separately to feed the exhaust mass flow to the high-pressure turbine or the low-pressure turbine or the exhaust pipe, it is anticipated that such system could achieve even better breathing characteristics than the standard one-stage turbocharged engine. The simulation was carried out on a heavily downsized R 2 S turbocharged SI engine model. As the major objective of this project is to explore the gas exchange process for the DEP-based R 2 S downsized engine, the knock model in the system is ignored. The results showed that PMEP is significantly improved over the entire engine speed and BSFC was decreased by up to 3 % with minimum modification of the original system. The system also showed the potential benefit for knock sensitivity and it is considered that by adding the knock model, there will be some more BSFC improvement...|$|R
40|$|In our {{previous}} paper, a new gas exchange concept termed divided <b>exhaust</b> <b>period</b> regulated two-stage (DEP R 2 S) {{system has been}} proposed. In this system, two exhaust valves in each cylinder are separately functioned with one valve feeding the exhaust mass flow into the high-pressure (HP) manifold, while the other valve evacuating the remaining mass flow directly into the low-pressure (LP) manifold. By adjusting {{the timing of the}} exhaust valves, the target boost can be controllable while improving the engine's pumping work and scavenging is attainable which results in better fuel efficiency from the gas exchange perspective. This paper will continue this study by adding an appropriate knock model to examine the benefits this concept could bring to the combustion phasing. The results at full load showed that under knock limited spark advance (KLSA) and fully optimized exhaust valve timing condition, the DEP R 2 S system benefited from lower pumping loss and better scavenging due to the reduced backpressure and improved pulsation interference despite suffering from reduced expansion ratio and expansion work. The combustion phasing was advanced across the engine speed which is mainly attributed to the reduced residual and the reduced requirement of gross indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP). The net brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) was observed to improve by up to 3 % depending on the engine operating points. At part load, the DEP R 2 S system {{could be used as a}} mechanism to extend the “duration” of the exhaust valve. This will reduce the recompression effect of the exhaust residuals during the beginning and the end of the exhaust stroke compared to the original R 2 S model with late exhaust valve opening and early exhaust valve opening. In addition, increased internal exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) due to the increased overlap between the LP and the intake valve is also beneficial for the improved pumping mean effective pressure (PMEP) as the throttle can be further opened to reduce the corresponding throttling loss. The average net BSFC improvement is expected to be approximately 6 – 7 %...|$|R

40|$|Most {{downsized}} gasoline engines {{currently in}} the market place {{appear to have a}} ‘downsizing factor’ of approximately 30 % to 40 %. However, as concerns regarding fuel efficiency and emission legislations increase, more aggressive downsizing may have to be introduced. This, although can improve fuel efficiency and enhance power density of a gasoline engine further, has some challenges that must be addressed. Large backpressure {{is one of the most}} important aspects that needs to be improved for a highly downsized gasoline engine, especially if a Regulated 2 -stage system is considered. The Divided <b>Exhaust</b> <b>Period</b> (DEP) concept is an alternative gas exchange process, where two exhaust valves from each cylinder separately function, with one valve leading the blow-down pulse into the turbocharger turbine, while the remainder of the exhaust mass flow bypasses the turbine through the other valve. The simulation results suggest that by adopting the DEP concept, the full-load Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC) and the stability of the engine were all improved due to the fact that the DEP concept features a better gas exchange process and improved combustion phasing. The part-load BSFC could also be reduced by using the scavenging valve to extend the ‘duration’ of the exhaust valve (thus reducing the re-compression effect) and to achieve internal exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) through reverse flow. However, this depends on the authorities of the scavenging valve timing (and piston clearance) and the combustion stability (EGR tolerance). Driveability issue and poor fuel efficiency in some engine operating regions of a conventional fixed-ratio positive-displacement supercharging system also need to be mitigated. A continuously variable transmission (CVT) driven supercharging solution, with the capability to decouple the supercharger speed from the engine speed, has the potential to provide the full-load BSFC improvement and to enhance the driveability performance, with a minor penalty in part-load BSFC. Both the simulation and experimental results have demonstrated its advantages over its fixed-ratio positive-displacement counterpart. The high-load fuel consumption can be improved by as much as 17. 5 %, and the time-to-torque performance can be improved by up to 37 %. The low-load BSFC was only degraded by up to 2 %, however, given that there was no clutch fitted for the CVT driven supercharging system, a better transient performance is anticipated...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was performed to}} determine the effects of substantial spark retard on engine combustion, hydrocarbon (HC) emissions, feed gas enthalpy, and catalyst light-off. Engine experiments were conducted at cold engine conditions for various ignition timings and air/ fuel ratios. Chemical and thermal energy of the exhaust gas was tracked from cylinder-exit to the catalytic converter inlet using a variety of experimental techniques. Time-resolved exhaust port and exhaust runner hydrocarbon concentrations were converted to an exhaust HC mass flow rate and compared to time-averaged downstream HC levels. Quenching experiments quantified cylinder-exit HC emissions by rapidly cooling exhaust gas at the valve seats, effectively freezing HC oxidation reactions. Combustion stability was observed to decrease as the phasing of the 50 % mass fraction burned location occurred later in the expansion stroke. A thermodynamic burn rate analysis indicated combustion was complete by exhaust valve opening with spark timings as late as 200 after top-dead-center (ATDC). Engine operation with a relative air/fuel ratio 10 % lean of stoichiometric resulted in the lowest observed tailpipe-out HC emissions. Retarded spark timings increased exhaust system oxidation, with port HC oxidation ranging from 15 % to 37 % with additional HC reductions (40 - 50 %) in the runner for ATDC spark timings. Catalyst light-off times were reduced by 5 seconds and cumulative catalytic converter-in HC emissions were reduced by 44 % prior to light-off. A phenomenological model of exhaust system oxidation was developed to provide insight into HC burn-up with late combustion phasing. (cont.) A detailed chemical kinetic mechanism was coupled with an exhaust flow model and exhaust thermal model. The hydrocarbon tracking and exhaust gas quenching experiments provided initial conditions for a reacting plug flow model.

40|$|Due {{to growing}} {{concerns}} regarding global energy security and environmental sustainability {{it is becoming}} increasingly important to increase the energy efficiency of the transport sector. The internal combustion engine will probably continue to be the main propulsion system for road transportation for many years to come. Hence, much effort must be put in reducing the fuel consumption of the internal combustion engine to prolong a future decline in fossil fuel production and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Turbocharging and variable valve actuation applied to any engine has shown great benefits to engine efficiency and performance. However, using a turbocharger on an engine gives some drawbacks. In an attempt to solve some of these issues and increase engine efficiency further this thesis deals with the investigation of a novel gas exchange concept called divided <b>exhaust</b> <b>period</b> (DEP). The core idea of the DEP concept is to utilize variable valve timing technology on the exhaust side in combination with turbocharging. The principle of the concept is to let the initial high energy blow-down pulse feed the turbocharger, but bypass the turbine during {{the latter part of the}} exhaust stroke when back pressure dominates the pumping work. The exhaust flow from the cylinder is divided between two exhaust manifolds of which one is connected to the turbine, and one bypasses the turbine. The flow split between the manifolds is controlled with a variable valve train system. The DEP concept has been studied through simulations on three heavy-duty diesel engines; one without exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), one with short route EGR and one with long route EGR. Simulations show a potential improvement to pumping work, due to reduced backpressure, with increased overall engine efficiency as a result. Although, the efficiency improvement is highly dependent on exhaust valve size and configuration due to issues with choked flow in the exhaust valves. The EGR system of choice also proves to have a high impact on the working principle of the DEP application. Furthermore, the DEP concept allows better control of the boost pressure and allows the turbine to operate at higher efficiency across the whole load and speed range. The option of discarding both wastegate and variable geometry turbine is apparent, and there is little need for a twin-entry type turbine since pulse interference between cylinders is less of an issue.

40|$|Turbocompounding {{has been}} a {{development}} on heavy diesel engines to improve the utilisation of exhaust heat energy. This system, however, introduces additional pumping losses and exhaust back pressure. Previous {{research has shown that}} the introduction of a divided <b>exhaust</b> <b>period</b> (DEP) to the turbocompound engine using staggered timing on exhaust valves feeding individual manifolds lowers the exhaust back pressure, improving engine breathing and behaviour. Exhaust flow is divided into two distinct flow paths beginning at the exhaust valves – through the turbocharger (blowdown), and bypassing it (scavenging). However, research showed that using one exhaust valve for each flow path can significantly lower the effective flow areas for exhaust gases at higher engine speeds. This leads to highly choked flow and consequently reduced engine output. A solution proposed was the division of the flow paths external to the exhaust port, henceforth named external DEP (ExDEP). In this solution, both exhaust valves open identical to those of the original engine, but the gas flow is divided downstream with the use of independent valves. By the use of ExDEP on a turbocompounded diesel engine the above research resulted in a brake specific fuel consumption benefit of up to 4 % over a regular turbocharged engine. This thesis project, conducted at the Advanced Technology and Research division of Volvo Group Trucks Technology in association with the Combustion department of Chalmers University, aims to implement and evaluate the effects of ExDEP on an existing GT-SUITE simulation model of a two-stage turbocompounded Volvo HDE 13 engine. Various flow components (valve types) and architectures are modelled. The effect of timing and phasing of the ExDEP valves on engine performance is investigated. Resizing of the existing turbine is investigated due to the altered gas flow. Rough CAD models are prepared to determine the feasibility of physically incorporating such systems on existing engines. A further adaptation to the existing engine model is the incorporation of CAD data of a novel engine concept currently being developed at Volvo GTT, in order to study the feasibility of ExDEP with this engine. With the implementation of ExDEP, a primary advantage foreseen is that the exhaust flow into the turbines can be constantly controlled. This eliminates the need for variable geometry turbochargers, bringing large reductions in system cost and complexity. It can enable other innovative technologies such as Miller cycle operation, air hybrid operation when an air tank is coupled to the exhaust manifold...|$|R

The resource will be completely <b>exhausted</b> after a <b>period</b> of time depending on the rate of exploitation. In this sense a mineral resource can be described as a non-renewable natural resource which is liable to get <b>exhausted</b> after some <b>period</b> of time. It is also a static resource because we always know how much of the resource remains, once we know how much has been removed. A fishery resource is very much different in character. It is a self-regulating renewable natural resource. Consider a fish population occupying a certain area of the sea. Now when a certain portion of the population is removed, the remaining portion in the habitat gets better food, more area to move about, and this results in faster growth rate, lesser mortality rates and also the spawns get better chance of survival- The result is that the resource resuscitates itself quickly. Apart from fishing, the population is also affected by many other fishery-independent environmental factors such as available food supply, change in salinity, temperature of the water, change in ocean-currents etc. Thus the fishery resource is a dynamic resource, ever changing due to impact of fishing and other fishery-independent factors...|$|R
50|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} as an HC serving with the 1st Marine Division in action against enemy aggressor forces on the night of 26-27 March 1953. After reaching an intermediate objective during a counterattack against a heavily entrenched and numerically superior hostile force occupying ground on a bitterly contested outpost far in advance of the main line of resistance, HC Hammond's platoon was subjected to a murderous barrage of hostile mortar and artillery fire, followed by a vicious assault by onrushing enemy troops. Resolutely advancing through the veritable curtain of fire to aid his stricken comrades, HC Hammond moved among the stalwart garrison of marines and, although critically wounded himself, valiantly continued to administer aid to the other wounded throughout an <b>exhausting</b> 4-hour <b>period.</b> When the unit was ordered to withdraw, he skillfully directed the evacuation of casualties and remained in the fire-swept area to assist the corpsmen of the relieving unit until he was struck by a round of enemy mortar fire and fell, mortally wounded. By his exceptional fortitude, inspiring initiative and self-sacrificing efforts, HC Hammond undoubtedly saved the lives of many marines. His great personal valor in the face of overwhelming odds enhances and sustains the finest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.|$|R
40|$|From Summary] The federal/state {{unemployment}} compensation (UC) {{system is}} designed to provide temporary and partial wage replacement to workers who have become involuntarily unemployed. UC also helps to stabilize the economy by providing unemployed workers with additional purchasing power, which serves as an economic stimulus when unemployment rises during recessions. The UC system generally provides sufficient duration of benefits during periods of economic prosperity, as most UC beneficiaries experience fewer weeks of unemployment than their maximum entitlements and return to work before their benefit rights are <b>exhausted.</b> However, during <b>periods</b> of economic decline, people tend to remain unemployed longer because of the greater difficulty in finding new jobs, and a rising proportion of jobless workers exhaust UC benefits without finding new work. Thus, programs have been established {{to increase the number of}} weeks of assistance during periods of high unemployment...|$|R
50|$|The Pope fasted {{and prayed}} {{for three days and}} at the end of that <b>period,</b> <b>exhausted,</b> he {{received}} a vision in his dream from the Blessed Virgin Mary who gave him detailed instructions to free the city from that scourge. On the Thursday after the third Sunday of Lent in 1099, the Pope summoned the whole clergy and all the inhabitants of Rome and set up an impressive procession that, with the crucifix at its head, went along the urban stretch of Via Flaminia until it reached the infested place. There the Pope performed the rite of exorcism and then struck a determined blow at the root of the walnut tree. The infernal creatures erupted from their haunt madly screaming. When the whole tree was removed the remains of the emperor were discovered among the ruins and the Pope ordered to throw them into the waves of the Tiber.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{elucidate}} parent´s {{experience of}} {{having had a}} baby with colic four years previously and of how the colic and care influenced the family in a long-term perspective. METHODOLOGY AND PARTICIPANTS: A qualitative inductive follow-up study with 13 individual and one focus group interview including four parents. Altogether ten mothers and seven fathers representing 12 families, who had been interviewed {{when they were in}} the midst of the colicky period four years ago, were in the present study interviewed between December 2010 and May 2011. Parents' narratives were analysed using content analysis. RESULTS: Parent´s memories of the <b>exhausting</b> colic <b>period</b> were vivid, but when the colic had healed the family relationships also healed. Although it had taken longer time for some parents to attach to their child they now experienced a close relationship with their four year old child and felt confident in their role as parent. The colic scream was still unbearable and evoked negative feelings in the parents. Parents had decreased confidence in Child Health services and made suggestions for improvements in the health care approach. Most of all they wished for an effective treatment of infantile colic. CONCLUSION: The family relationships were healed and the colic left only few residual symptoms but parents still had decreased confidence in the Child Health Center. Consequently, there is a need to raise awareness to parents' situation when having a child with infantile colic...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a stock flow of an {{inventory}} problem over induced demand. The inventory is consumed through “core customer” or chain marketing system in an induced environment (inductance) to exhaust all the items of the stock inventory in an indefinite time. The demand rate is depicted due to induced factor which is generated from the same inventory presented nearby. The inventory cycle time is split into several periodic times due to oscillatory feature of the inventory which is called phase inventory. Considering uniform demand, this cycle time splits into two basic parts, namely, “first shift” (phase) and “second shift” (phase). Since the process dampens over time, so the whole inventory will <b>exhaust</b> after few <b>periods.</b> A cost function consisted of inventory cost, setup cost, and loss for induced items is minimized to obtain optimal order quantity and replenishment time. The multivariate lagrange interpolation (MLI) over the average values of the postsensitivity analysis is developed here. Finally, graphical illustrations are made to justify the model...|$|R
25|$|The Battle for Longueval and Delville Wood, {{had started}} with a charge by the 2nd Indian Cavalry Division between Longueval and High Wood and {{two weeks after the}} wood was cleared, tanks went into action for the first time. A number of {{important}} tactical lessons were learned from the battle for the village and wood. Night assembly and advances, dawn attacks after short, concentrated artillery barrages for tactical surprise, defensive lines built on the fringes wooded areas, because tree roots in woods prevented digging and to avoid shells which detonated in branches, showering troops with wood splinters. Troops were relieved after two days, as longer <b>periods</b> <b>exhausted</b> them and consumed their ammunition, bombs and rations. The persistence of the British attacks during July and August, helped to preserve Franco-British relations, although Joffre criticised the large number of small attacks on 11 August and tried to cajole Haig into agreeing to a big combined attack. A bigger attack British by three corps on 18 August, was spoilt by several days of heavy rain, which reduced artillery observation and gained no ground at Delville Wood.|$|R
5000|$|Brine {{was carried}} in wooden pipes from Sülze and peat {{delivered}} by boat using a canal excavated for the purpose. As early as 1719 there were discussions about moving the boiling houses again because Bornrieth Moor was <b>exhausted.</b> In the <b>period</b> from 1719 to 1725 the brine pipeline was relaid {{to the newly}} established village of Altensalzkoth in the [...] "Scheuer Bruch" [...] marsh. The existing pipes were moved from Lindhorst along the river Örtze eastwards past Eversen to the salt house at Altensaltzkoth. But because the brine had to be piped over a greater distance, other problems arose. At [...] "Zuckenberg" [...] the brine was pumped to a height of 5 m by a water-powered pump (Zucke) {{in order to achieve}} the required natural slope. Leaks and regular blockages in the pipes soon meant that economical production was no longer possible. This led finally to the boiling houses being relocated back to Sülze. To overcome the continued lack of fuel locally, an improved transportation system was established, enabling peat from the surrounding areas to be delivered to Sülze.|$|R
40|$|Land cover {{can change}} {{frequently}} on intensively managed landscapes, affecting water quality across different spatiotemporal scales. Multi-resolution datasets are {{necessary in order}} to assess the extent and trends of these changes, as well as potential cross-scale interactions. In this study, both spatial and temporal analyses of land disturbance (i. e., soil exposure from vegetation removal) and water quality were performed on datasets ranging from daily to yearly time scales. Time-series analyses of land disturbance were compared against the water quality variables of total suspended solids (TSS), turbidity, and visual clarity for the Hoteo River catchment on the North Island of New Zealand for the 2000 – 2013 period. During forest harvest and recovery phases, exotic forests were the dominant disturbance, up to ﬁve times the area of grassland disturbance; while after recovery, grasslands assumed the dominant role, for up to 16 times the area of forest disturbance. Time-series of TSS from ﬁeld sampling (2000 – 2013) and TSS-event analyses (2012 – 2014) displayed distinct nonlinear patterns, suggesting that after major events, sediment that is stored in the landscape is <b>exhausted</b> and a <b>period</b> of sediment build-up follows until the next major event. Time-series analyses also showed a connection between trends in connected land disturbance and visual water clarity, with connected disturbance having {{the potential to be a}} water quality indicator. Future research should be conducted at even ﬁner spatiotemporal scales over longer periods in order to identify effects of localized land disturbances on downstream water quality...|$|R
40|$|A pilot-scale {{biofiltration}} {{unit was}} constructed at a pig finishing {{building on the}} University College Dublin research farm. The biofiltration system was investigated over three trial <b>periods.</b> <b>Exhaust</b> air from a single pen was extracted by a variable speed centrifugal fan and passed through a humidifier and biofilter. A 0 · 5 m depth of woodchips of over 20 mm screen size {{was used as the}} biofilter medium. The moisture content of the medium was maintained at 64 ± 4 % (wet weight basis) for trial one and 69 ± 4 % (wet weight basis) for trials two and three using a load cell method. The volumetric loading rate varied from 769 to 1898 m 3 [air] m− 3 [medium] h− 1 during the three trial periods. Odour and ammonia removal efficiencies ranged from 77 to 95 % and 54 to 93 %, respectively. The pH of the biofilter leachate remained between 6 and 8 throughout the experimental periods. The pressure drop across the biofilter ranged from 14 to 64 Pa. It is concluded that a wood chip media particle size > 20 mm is suitable for use in biofiltration systems on intensive pig production facilities. This will minimize the pressure drop on the system fans to reduce overall operation costs. It is recommended that a filter bed moisture content (wet weight basis) of greater than 63 % be used to maintain overall efficiency. An efficient air moisturizing system (humidification and bed sprinkling) along with a properly designed air distribution system must be incorporated in the overall design when operating at such high volumetric loading rates...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{series of}} {{long-term}} numerical simulations of moist convection in Jupiter’s atmosphere is performed {{in order to}} investigate the idealized characteristics of the vertical structure of multi-composition clouds and the convective motions associated with them, varying the deep abundances of condensable gases and the autoconversion time scale, the latter {{being one of the}} most questionable parameters in cloud microphysical parameterization. The simulations are conducted using a two-dimensional cloud resolving model that explicitly represents the convective motion and microphysics of the three cloud components, H 2 O, NH 3, and NH 4 SH imposing a body cooling that substitutes the net radiative cooling. The results are qualitatively similar to those reported in Sugiyama et al. (Sugiyama, K. et al. [2011]. Intermittent cumulonimbus activity breaking the three-layer cloud structure of Jupiter. Geophys. Res. Lett. 38, L 13201. doi: 10. 1029 / 2011 GL 047878) : stable layers associated with condensation and chemical reaction act as effective dynamical and compositional boundaries, intense cumulonimbus clouds develop with distinct temporal intermittency, and the active transport associated with these clouds results in the establishment of mean vertical profiles of condensates and condensable gases that are distinctly different from the hitherto accepted three-layered structure (e. g., Atreya, S. K., Romani, P. N. [1985]. Photochemistry and clouds of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. In: Recent Advances in Planetary Meteorology. Cambridge Univ. Press, London, pp. 17 – 68). Our results also demonstrate that the period of intermittent cloud activity is roughly proportional to the deep abundance of H 2 O gas. The autoconversion time scale does not strongly affect the results, except for the vertical profiles of the condensates. Changing the autoconversion time scale by a factor of 100 changes the intermittency period by a factor of less than two, although it causes a dramatic increase in the amount of condensates in the upper troposphere. The moist convection layer becomes potentially unstable with respect to an air parcel rising from below the H 2 O lifting condensation level (LCL) well before the development of cumulonimbus clouds. The instability accumulates until an appropriate trigger is provided by the H 2 O condensate that falls down through the H 2 O LCL; the H 2 O condensate drives a downward flow below the H 2 O LCL {{as a result of the}} latent cooling associated with the re-evaporation of the condensate, and the returning updrafts carry moist air from below to the moist convection layer. Active cloud development is terminated when the instability is completely <b>exhausted.</b> The <b>period</b> of intermittency is roughly equal to the time obtained by dividing the mean temperature increase, which is caused by active cumulonimbus development, by the body cooling rate...|$|R
