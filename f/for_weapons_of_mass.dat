[...] Further, [...] "Saddam Hussein's activities continue to be unacceptable and, in my view, dangerous to the region and, indeed, to the world, not only because he possesses the potential <b>for</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction but because of the very nature of his regime.

2500|$|Humans, as empirically-minded beings, tend to {{recognize}} a threat explicitly only once it has actually materialized. [...] In World War I {{it was only after}} frontal attacks had met with carnage from machine guns, that alternative military tactics were devised. [...] To be sure, conflict springs eternal: [...] between communities; between individuals; within a given individual. [...] What distinguishes history's contemporary period is that—with the exponential growth of population, science, technology, economic activity, weapons destructiveness, and environmental degradation—global threats, military and environmental, have been getting ever more comprehensive: [...] now, willy-nilly, everyone on Earth is affected. [...] However, if solutions to existential global threats can find consensus, then their enforcement may find precedents in verification procedures that have been used in connection with 20th- and 21st-century threatened-species-protection agreements, searches <b>for</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction, and strategic-arms reductions.|$|E

[...] He added that his change of opinion came about from {{attending}} the funeral of a sergeant killed in Iraq, when his last letter to his family was being read out. On June 16, 2005, he joined with three other members of Congress (Neil Abercrombie, Dennis Kucinich and Ron Paul) in introducing a resolution calling for the start of a withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq to begin by October 2006. Jones covered the hallway outside his office with photographs of soldiers who had died in Iraq.
