5|$|In the Remodernism manifesto, the Stuckists {{declared}} that they aimed to replace postmodernism with remodernism, {{a period of}} renewed spiritual (as opposed to religious) values in art, culture and society. Other manifestos have included Handy Hints, Anti-anti-art, The Cappuccino writer and the <b>Idiocy</b> of Contemporary Writing, The Turner Prize, The Decreptitude of the Critic and Stuckist critique of Damien Hirst.|$|E
5|$|Dunrobin Castle {{was built}} {{in the midst of a}} tribal society, with Norse and Gaelic in use at the time. Robert the Bruce planted the Gordons, who {{supported}} his claim to the crown, at Huntly in Aberdeenshire, and they were created Earls of Huntly in 1445. The Earldom passed to the Gordon family in the 16th century when the 8th Earl of Sutherland gave his daughter Elizabeth in marriage to Adam Gordon. After the 8th Earl died in 1508, Elizabeth's elder brother was declared heir to the title, but a brieve (writ) of <b>idiocy</b> brought against him and his younger brother by the Gordons meant that the possession of the estate went to Adam Gordon in 1512.|$|E
5|$|Idiots and lunatics {{had their}} land looked after by a court-appointed administrator, and any profits {{went into a}} trust fund to support the insane person. Due to the vested {{interest}} of the King (who would hold the lands) the actual lunacy or <b>idiocy</b> was determined by a jury, not by an individual judge. Under the Lunacy Act 1845 the Lord Chancellor {{had a right to}} appoint a commission to investigate the insanity of an individual; as part of his role as Keeper of the King's conscience, however, he would only do this when it was beneficial to the lunatic, not simply because somebody had been found insane.|$|E

50|$|Sahoo was the {{recipient}} of the Kanta Kabi Award in 2001, the Sahitya Bharati Award in 2006, and the Utkal Ratna Award in 2013. His stories described the subtleties of human emotion and featured verbal as well as situational comedy. His works are also noted for satirizing human <b>idiocies.</b>|$|R

25|$|The humour of Hay's films {{has been}} {{described}} as subversive and similar to that of fellow English comedian Frank Randle. His films are often characterised as exhibiting traits of Anti-authoritarianism and having a satirical approach towards how authority figures are portrayed, this is notable with Hay himself, as he often played an incompetent authority figure who struggled not to be found out, but whose <b>idiocy</b> was discovered by those around him.|$|E
25|$|Smith {{denounced the}} {{expedition}} as <b>idiocy</b> and labelled its supporters either fools or traitors. He then disbanded the council until March 1 unless {{they agreed to}} renounce the Matamoros Expedition. The council determined that Smith had no authority to dismiss them. They soon impeached Smith and named the lieutenant governor, Robinson, Acting Governor. The documents forming the provisional government, however, did not grant the council the authority to impeach the governor.|$|E

5000|$|Some bloggers use {{the term}} [...] "Blair's Law" [...] to {{describe}} a theoretical alliance or shared empathy between far right groups, far left groups and extremist Islamists. In 2002, Blair described this supposed alliance as an [...] "ongoing {{process by which the}} world's multiple <b>idiocies</b> are becoming one giant, useless force". The phrase has been adopted and embraced by several conservative and libertarian bloggers.|$|R
5000|$|Each is {{introduced}} by a video-montage poking mild fun at various political <b>idiocies.</b> Their style is orthodox standup, distinguished {{by the quality}} - and to a non-"brown" [...] audience, novelty - of the material. Rahman has a cheerful, upbeat manner whereas Hussain has a sly, laconic and wry sardonic manner. Hussain is energetic, using an assortment of accents and playful movements whilst Rahman proves black comedy delivered when standing still {{can be just as}} effective.|$|R

25|$|During the 13 months (in the) almost continual and {{sustained}} combat in which I have ever participated, there were moments, and rare ones, I am sure; but they lose {{none of their}} terror or horror for which fear laid a relentless and a powerful hold on me, that the pull of cowardice was almost more than I could ward off. There were terrible moments that encompassed a lifetime, an endlessness, when terror was so strong in me, that I could feel <b>idiocy</b> replace reason. (Yet,) I have never left my position, nor have I shirked hazardous duty. Fear {{did not make a}} coward out of me.|$|E
25|$|It is {{a curious}} fact that amaurotic family <b>idiocy,</b> a rare and fatal disease of children, occurs mostly among Jews. The largest number of cases has been {{observed}} in the United States—over thirty in number. It was at first {{thought that this was}} an exclusively Jewish disease because most of the cases at first reported were between Russian and Polish Jews; but recently there have been reported cases occurring in non-Jewish children. The chief characteristics of the disease are progressive mental and physical enfeeblement; weakness and paralysis of all the extremities; and marasmus, associated with symmetrical changes in the macula lutea. On investigation of the reported cases, they found that neither consanguinity nor syphilitic, alcoholic, or nervous antecedents in the family history are factors in the etiology of the disease. No preventive measures have as yet been discovered, and no treatment has been of benefit, all the cases having terminated fatally.|$|E
5000|$|Sunday Times. Peter Miller: [...] "By far {{the best}} book to {{have come out of}} the Balkan wars, not because it {{explains}} the conflict simply, but because Stankovic demonstrates with wit and eloquence that simplicity was never part of the equation...It is not, however, a bleak book. Far from it. There is humour, lots of it, often (inevitably) black, but also reflecting the accidental <b>idiocies</b> and genuinely comic scenes that occurred in the midst of organised chaos." ...|$|R

Haven't met you yet, but my name is Roosevelt, and I'm the new janitor," [...] with a hundred other chuckling <b>idiocies,</b> till Miss Moynihan was happy again. Una warmed to his friendliness, like that of a tail-wagging little yellow pup.|$|R
5000|$|Theater {{critic and}} {{historian}} Brooks Atkinson wrote in 1970 of The New York Idea, a tart comedy about divorce, that [...] "the dialogue is still lively and the <b>idiocies</b> {{of the character}} are still pertinent," [...] securely placing it in the long tradition of drawing-room comedy. [...] Some reviewers at the time sanctimoniously took issue {{with the idea of}} a comedy about a socially questionable topic such as divorce, but others praised Mitchell for writing in the spirit of British playwrights Arthur Wing Pinero and Henry Arthur Jones.|$|R
25|$|A man (McKinney) named Darill (pronounced da-RILL), {{who never}} quite understands {{what is going}} on, but always tries to affect an air of sophistication. Darill's strange mix of sunny good will, <b>idiocy</b> and pretense annoys {{everyone}} he meets, although he is rarely aware of it. Famous Darill sketches involve him hosting a painting show on television, and joining the Big Brother program and mentoring an unreceptive boy. The background for Darill's strange behavior is explained somewhat in one sketch, in which we see a flashback of Darill {{as a child in}} Belgium, and the strange rapport he enjoys with his mother (whom he still lives with, much to the confusion of the date he has brought back to his apartment). One sketch also reveals that the only thing he ever daydreams about is a tiny oom-pah band playing on a windowsill, and is astonished when he discovers others don't have that limitation. After the end of The Kids in the Hall television show, Mark McKinney became a Saturday Night Live cast member, and brought Darill onto that show.|$|E

50|$|The show {{is almost}} entirely political, but in recent series {{different}} genres of sketches have been introduced. The programme features regular stand-up impressionism sections by Bremner, Another feature is interviews between Bird and Fortune, one of them normally as George Parr, {{a man in a}} government position or a businessman, who normally ends up exposing the <b>idiocies</b> of their area of expertise. There are also heavily researched, bitingly satirical three-handed historical narratives; the dinner party sketches, featuring Bird, Fortune, Pauline McLynn and Frances Barber; and other small sketches. The show ends with a (usually political) musical number.|$|R

In {{the run-up to}} the January Democratic primary in South Carolina, the Clinton campaign ran ads featuring Angelou's endorsement. The ads were part of the campaign's efforts to rally support in the Black community; but Obama won the South Carolina primary, finishing 29 points ahead of Clinton and taking 80% of the Black vote. When Clinton's campaign ended, Angelou put her support behind Senator Barack Obama, who {{went on to win the}} election and became the first African-American president of the United States.

6000|$|Mark Twain {{was just}} as irreverent as he dared be, and 1601 reveals his richest {{expression}} of sovereign contempt for overstuffed language, genteel literature, and conventional <b>idiocies.</b> Later, when a magazine editor apostrophized, [...] "O {{that we had a}} Rabelais!" [...] Mark impishly and anonymously--submitted 1601; and that same editor, a praiser of Rabelais, scathingly abused it and the sender. In this episode, as in many others, Mark Twain, the [...] "bad boy" [...] of American literature, revealed his huge delight in blasting the shams of contemporary hypocrisy. Too, there was always the spirit of Tom Sawyer deviltry in Mark's make-up that prompted him, as he himself boasted, to see how much holy indignation he could stir up in the world.|$|R
500|$|Critic Nicholas Sylvain said [...] "Moonraker {{seems to}} have {{more than its share of}} little flaws and {{annoyances}} which begin right from the opening pre-credit sequence. The sheer <b>idiocy</b> (and impossibility) of having a fully fueled shuttle on the back of the Boeing during the trans-Atlantic crossing should be evident, and later in the film, the whole Jaws-falls-in-love and becomes a 'good guy' routine leaves me rather cold, and provides far too much cheesy comedy moments, as does the gondola driving through the square scene." ...|$|E

With his head throbbing, his tongue and lips stinging from cigarettes, he incredulously counted the number of drinks he had taken, and groaned, [...] "I got to quit!"

This essay explores one practice—administratively discharging clients from addiction treatment—that we suspect will be judged harshly by historians of the not so distant future...|$|R

While the daily strips' plots often deal with her discouragement, Marla maintains an optimistic attitude and often mentions a dream of opening her own small store or boutique. She vents her frustration by writing a retail manifesto railing against the <b>idiocies</b> of customers and management, which at last mention had grown to 200 pages.
