40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the diet of children under the government-funded meal support program. The 143 children (67 boys and 76 girls) participated in this study among 4 th- 6 th elementary school students receiving free lunches during the summer vacation of 2007 and living in Gwanak-gu, Seoul, Korea. The subjects consisted of four groups supported by <b>Meal</b> <b>Box</b> Delivery (n = 26), Institutional Foodservice (n = 53), Restaurant Foodservice (n = 27), or Food Delivery (n = 37). A three-day 24 -hour dietary recall and a self-administered survey were conducted. In addition, the children’s heights and weights were measured. The average energy intake of the children was 1, 400 kcal per day, much lower than the Estimated Energy Requirements of the pertinent age groups. The results also showed inadequate intake of all examined nutrients; of particular concern was the extremely low intake of calcium. On average, the children consumed eight dishes and 25 food items per day. The children supported by <b>Meal</b> <b>Box</b> Delivery consumed more various dishes and food items than the other groups. The percentage of children preferring their current meal support method was the highest in those supported by <b>Meal</b> <b>Box</b> Delivery and the lowest in those supported by Food Delivery. We requested 15 children among the 143 children participating in the survey to draw the scene of their lunch time. The drawings of the children supported by Institutional Foodservice showed more positive scenes than the other groups, especially in terms of human aspects. In conclusion, the overall diet of children under the government-funded meal support program was nutritionally inadequate, although the magnitude of the problems tended to differ by the meal support method. The results could be utilized as basic data for policy and programs regarding the government-funded meal support program for children from low-income families...|$|R

Amount of vegetables was negatively correlated with amount of energy （r＝－ 0. 432, p＝ 0. 017 ）, and percentage energy from fat （r＝－ 0. 380, p＝ 0. 038 ）. Although, no significant correlation was found between amount of vegetables and sodium chloride equivalent（ r＝－ 00. 97, p＝ 06. 09 ）. One of the reasons of these negative correlations between amount of vegetables and energy or percentage energy from fat in <b>boxed</b> <b>meals</b> will be less energy and fat contents of vegetables. コンビニ弁当の食材重量の実態を把握し、野菜量とエネルギー、脂肪エネルギー比率および食塩相当量との関連を検討することを目的とした。新潟市北区内の会社の異なるコンビニ４社において、１１時半～１２時半に「めし」とおかず形態の幕の内スタイル弁当３１個を購入し、そのうちの３０個を食材別に秤量し、解析を行った。弁当の野菜量は平均±標準偏差１７. ５±１１. ９ gであった。また、野菜量とエネルギー量との間には負の相関が認められ（r＝－０. ４３２、p＝０. ０１７）、脂肪エネルギー比率も同様であった（r＝－０３. ８０、p＝００. ３８）。野菜量と食塩相当量の間には相関は見られなかった（r＝－００. ９７、p＝０６. ０９）。弁当の野菜量とエネルギー量および脂肪エネルギー比率に負の相関が見られた理由として、概して野菜にはエネルギーが少なく、脂質も少ないことが一つの要因と考えられた...|$|R

40|$|Protein-energy wasting (PEW), {{reflected}} by serum albumin 5. 5  mg/dL) is also common and {{is associated with}} high death risk. The traditional dietary approach to control hyperphosphatemia by limiting protein foods may cause or worsen PEW. We hypothesized that provision of a high protein diet including during HD treatment results in favorable outcomes if a potent phosphorus binder such as lanthanum carbonate (Fosrenol™) can control phosphorus simultaneously and conducted a pilot/feasibility randomized controlled trial in 110 hypoalbuminemic (< 4. 0  mg/dL) MHD patients in several dialysis clinics. After a washout period and upon 1 : 1 randomization, we provided the INTERVENTION group with 8 weeks of high protein meals as prepared <b>meal</b> <b>boxes</b> (50  g protein, 850  Cal, phosphorus to protein ratio < 10  mg/gm) during each HD treatment, along with 0. 5 to 1. 5  g Fosrenol (titrated as needed) plus dietary counseling to maintain a high dietary protein intake at home. The CONTROL group received <b>meal</b> <b>boxes</b> containing low calorie (< 50 Cal) and almost no protein (< 1  g, such as salads) during each HD treatment and continued non-Fosrenol binders. We examined combined change in serum albumin with remaining in target phosphorus range of 3. 5 -< 5. 5  mg/dL over the 8 weeks of intervention. Among the 51 intervention and 55 control subjects who qualified for the intention-to-treat analyses, the combined rise in albumin ≥ 0. 2  g/dL while maintaining phosphorus in 3. 5 -< 5. 5  mg/dL range was achieved in 25. 5 % and 9. 8 %, respectively (χ² p-value 0. 036). No serious adverse events were reported, and patients reported satisfaction with high protein meals during HD. Hence, provision of high protein meals combined with Fosrenol™ during HD is safe and may improve albumin while controlling serum phosphorus. ClinicalTrials. gov # NCT 011169...|$|R
