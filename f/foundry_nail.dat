5000|$|In the 1870s, an {{assessment}} was thus: [...] "The trade {{of the town}} is chiefly with the agriculturists of the adjoining county of Radnor. There are two banking establishments, viz., the head offices of the Kington and Radnorshire bank (Messrs. Davies, Banks, & Davies), established in 1808, and {{a branch of the}} Midland Banking Company, Limited. There is an extensive iron <b>foundry,</b> <b>nail,</b> and agricultural implement manufactory carried on by Messrs. James. Meredith & Co., and the building and tanning trades are well represented. There are also some extensive corn mills and malt-houses. About four miles west of the town are the Old Radnor lime rocks, which are celebrated for their superior quality for building and for agricultural purposes. The market day is Tuesday, considerable business being transacted on that day in eggs, butter, poultry, &c., and is the mart to which the Welsh send their produce, to meet dealers who frequent this town from all quarters." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1868, Civil War general-turned-entrepreneur Hiram S. Chamberlain and the Richards {{brothers}} {{established the}} Knoxville Iron Company, which erected a massive <b>foundry</b> and <b>nail</b> factory across Second Creek from McGhee's Addition (part of this complex, now {{known simply as}} [...] "The Foundry," [...] still stands). [...] Chamberlain provided the business expertise, while the Richards brothers provided the technical expertise. [...] Several houses in Mechanicsville still have fences made from iron cast at the Knoxville Iron foundry in the 1870s and 1880s.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, the most {{significant}} industries in the watershed of Shamokin Creek were coal mining, <b>foundries,</b> iron works, <b>nail</b> production, agriculture, silk mills, and woolen mills. The creek was also used as water power for several small mills and {{was used as a}} water supply for the Pennsylvania Railroad. The Roaring Creek Water Company also used some of its tributaries as water supplies.|$|R
25|$|The main {{land uses}} in the {{watershed}} of Shamokin Creek are forested land and agricultural land, with barren land and urban land making up {{only a few}} percent of the watershed. However, in the upper , forested land and mine spoils dominate, urban land is less prevalent, and agricultural land is virtually nonexistent. Coal mining was being done in the watershed of Shamokin Creek by the early 1800s. In the early 1900s, coal mining, <b>foundries,</b> iron works, <b>nail</b> production, agriculture, silk mills, and woolen mills were the main industries in the watershed. In the 1990s and 2000s, many grants for restoring the creek have been received by various organizations.|$|R
5000|$|Anthracite, {{also known}} as stone coal or rock coal, is very {{difficult}} to ignite, mine, clean, and break into smaller chunks and requires correct conditions to build heat or hold temperature and sustain burning - which oft depend upon the size and uniformity of the coal particles. Yet American cities were cramped for fuels, woodlands were exhausted near bigger towns and Philadelphia, largest city in America needed fuels for mills and foundries as well to sustain manufacturing. Inventor and industrialist Josiah White (owner of a wire mill, <b>foundry</b> and <b>nail</b> factory), had determined how to burn anthracite in iron working processing furnaces during the War of 1812, but its use in smelting operations was hit or miss, dependent upon the material packing geometries of any particular charging load in a cold blast furnace. [...] The earlier development of coking of bituminous coal, as well anthracite coke enabled the smelting of iron using local coal sources with cold blast air in blast furnaces after the latter 1830s allowed the production of the vast quantities of iron that built the fundamental infrastructure of the early North American Industrial Revolution [...] - [...] which was built on iron products and only some steel. At the time, iron was used minimally with respect to wood. Even most railroad tracks were laid with wooden rails, sometimes covered by iron strapping. As more iron became available, more uses were found for iron, creating a cycle of increasing demand, experimentation and improvements - [...] part of the revolution in industrial revolution.|$|R
5000|$|The lower {{navigation}} {{began as}} a humble collection of removed stone obstructions, low piled rock dams with a system of wooden [...] "Bear Trap Locks" [...] invented by Lehigh Navigation Company managing partner, Josiah White who debugged scale models of the new lock design on Mauch Chunk Creek. would leverage the canal into the American Industrial Revolution, that for 111 years shipped the fuel feeding the foundries, forges, manufacturies, and steel mills of Eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and much of New York, New England, and the world. It started {{with the need for}} energy by White and partner Erskine Hazard who operated a wire mill, <b>foundry,</b> and <b>nail</b> factory at the Falls of the Schuylkill. Having learned the secret to burning anthracite during the British blockades in 1814, White and Hazard joined a number of Philadelphia luminaries in subscribing to a joint stock venture to build the Schuylkill Canal, but quarreled with the others on the board of managers, who did not favor a rapid development. Investigating options, they learned the managers of the Lehigh Coal Mine Company were willing to option their rights, disgusted with their long term inability to make a profit bringing Anthracite nearly 110 miles from Pisgah Ridge. A group, the Lehigh Navigation Company was holding a charter to improve the navigability of the Lehigh River, but had little to show for repeated expenditures and their charter was due to expire in 1817. White and Hazard made their proposal, which specified improvements for only down river navigation, and in March 1818 received a charter effectively giving the company ownership of the Lehigh to do with as they would. It had one fall-back provision [...] - [...] at some time the legislature might require the improvements be made to enable two way navigation.|$|R
