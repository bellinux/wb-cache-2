We have recently developed a single-chip <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>microphone</b> in a CMOS MEMS technology. The microphone {{consists of a}} suspended square membrane of 1. 4 mm side, 3 µm thick and 10 µg, and two concentric inductors. This suspended moving membrane is fixed to the substrate with 4 attachments arms. In order to achieve a desired flat frequency response characteristic, covering the entire acoustic band, several attachment designs are presented, studied and compared. These designs include crab-leg, meander, U-spring and serpentine forms. We have found that for comparable dimensions, the U-spring form presents the highest compliance and the meander type is the stiffest...|$|E

We have shown, {{that the use of}} an alternative current (AC) in the primary fixed inductor results in a substantially higher induced voltage in the secondary inductor comparing to the case when a direct current (DC) is used. The expected increase of the induced voltage can be expressed by a voltage ratio of AC and DC solutions that is in the range of 3 to 6. A prototype fabrication of this microphone has been realized using a combination of standard CMOS 0. 6 µm process with a CMOS-compatible post-process consisting in a bulk micromachining technology. The output voltage of the <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>microphone</b> that achieves the µV range can be increased by the use of the symmetric dual-layer spiral inductor structure...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an improved {{design of the}} <b>electrodynamic</b> CMOS-MEMS <b>microphone.</b> The studied microphone is based on two integrated concentric planar inductors, a fixed outer one and an inner one attached on a flexible vibrating diaphragm. First, the magnetic field, generated by the outerinductor, was evaluated. Unlike conventional <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>microphones</b> based on Faraday’s law, the induced voltage {{was found to be}} proportional to the product of the diaphragmdisplacement and its velocity. Even though the induced output voltage is in the range of a few microvolts, and its frequency is doubled compared to that of the incident acoustic wave. Thisresult pushed us to adjust and improve the basic principle of this kind of microphone by trying to generate a vertical downward shift of the microphone diaphragm while maintaining the COMScompatibility. The Lorentz force appears to be a possible alternative to the wafer bonding, as it will be automatically generated when we bias the inner inductor by a dc current. First, this paper shows that the induced voltage will be linear for a vertical fluctuation magnitude lower than 10 μm with an induced voltage in the range of several microvolts. Using the developed vertical offset technique, we show that induced voltages can be increased by a factor of 10 and the dynamic response of the electrodynamic microsensor will be appropriate for a use as a microphone...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an experimental way of characterizing the nonlinearities of electrodynamic microphones used as acoustical sources. This functioning occurs for reciprocal calibration techniques. For this purpose, its electrical impedance is {{measured with a}} Wayne Kerr wedge which has an excellent precision. Moreover, it can {{be noted that the}} Thiele and Small model is used to characterize its electrical impedance. Furthermore, an experimental method based on Simplex algorithm allows us to construct polynomial laws which describe the dependence of the Thiele and Small parameters with the input voltage. The nonlinear variations obtained allow us to determine the nonlinear differential equation of the <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>microphone.</b> Then, this equation is solved numerically in order to confirm the accuracy of the polynomial laws obtained by the Simplex algorithm. The distortions are measured with a laser Doppler velocimeter and compared with the ones obtained by the numerical solving of the nonlinear differential equation. The experimental displacement spectrum is consistent with the theoretical one...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper gives a {{detailed}} electroacoustic {{study of a}} new generation of monolithic CMOS microma- chined <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>microphone,</b> made with standard CMOS technology. The monolithic integration of the mechanical sensor with the electronics using a standard CMOS process is respected in the design, which presents the advantage of being inexpensive while having satisfactory performance. The MEMS microphone structure consists mainly of two planar inductors which occupy separate regions on substrate. One inductor is fixed; the other can exercise out-off plane movement. Firstly, we detail the process flow, which is used to fabricate our monolithic microphone. Subsequently, using the analogy between the three different physical domains, {{a detailed}} electro-mechanical-acoustic analogical analysis has been performed in order to model both frequency response and sensitivity of the microphone. Finally, we show that the theoretical microphone sensitivity is maximal for a constant vertical position of the diaphragm relative to the substrate, which means the distance between the outer and the inner inductor. The pressure sen- sitivity, which is found to be of the order of a few tens of μV/Pa, is flat within a bandwidth from 50 Hz to 5 kHz...|$|E
