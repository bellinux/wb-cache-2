The cardioprotective {{influence of a}} combination of <b>fenugreek</b> <b>seeds</b> and garlic by their antioxidant influence was evaluated in hypercholesterolemic rats administered isoproterenol.

Myocardial infarction was induced with isoproterenol injection. Increased circulatory troponin, disturbed activities of cardiac ATPases, increased serum iron and decreased ceruloplasmin confirmed myocardial infarction. Elevated lipid peroxides accompanied with reduced antioxidant molecules caused by isoproterenol and altered activities of antioxidant enzymes in serum and heart in induced myocardial necrosis were countered by dietary fenugreek, garlic, and fenugreek + garlic.

40|$|The BfR updated its Opinion No. 025 / 2011 of 11 July 2011 as to {{considerably}} {{emphasize the}} characteristics when using dry heat {{only for the}} elimination of EHEC on <b>fenugreek</b> <b>seeds.</b> There is a high probability that the cause for the EHEC outbreak event in Germany and France in May and June 2011 was attributable to contaminated <b>fenugreek</b> <b>seeds</b> and sprouts grown from them. However, the seeds are not only used for sprout production. Therefore, the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has assessed the relevance of EHEC O 104 :H 4 in <b>fenugreek</b> <b>seeds</b> which are used in different food including food supple-ments. Whether these products can cause an infection if processed with contaminated fenu-greek seeds is primarily determined by the preparation and processing methods. Depending on the producer and product, these methods can be very different and are, thus, not known in detail to BfR. According to the current state of knowledge it has to be assumed that the outbreak pathogen is only present in a very low concentration in <b>fenugreek</b> <b>seeds.</b> The capacity of EHEC to sur-vive in the <b>seeds</b> of <b>fenugreek</b> depends on the initial germ content and the treatment proc-esses applied. BfR moreover advises all consumers to thoroughly heat <b>fenugreek</b> <b>seeds</b> e. g. by roasting in a pan before further processing in private households Herbal teas containing <b>fenugreek</b> <b>seeds</b> should be infused with boiling water and left to draw for at least 5 minutes like all herbal teas.

40|$|Cancer is {{the second}} {{leading cause of death}} worldwide. Conventional therapies cause serious side effects and, at best, merely extend the patient`s {{lifespan}} by a few years. Cancer control may therefore benefit from the potential that resides in alternative therapies. There is thus an increasing demand to utilize alternative concepts or approaches to the prevention of cancer. The antineoplastic effect of Trigonella foenum graecum seed extract has been evaluated in human acute T Lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines (CCRF-HSB- 2). After determination of toxic level of <b>fenugreek</b> <b>seeds</b> extract on each cell lines, them were treated with different doses of extract and after incubation time (24 and 48 h) results were evaluated by cell count, viability test, staining and light microscopy and finally were analyzed in term of apoptosis induction using annexin v-fitc flowcytometry kit. Then data were analyzed using SPSS 11. 5 software. Results show significant effects of <b>Fenugreek</b> <b>seeds</b> extract against this cell line such as growth inhibition, cell death and morphological change. Apoptosis induction by this extract in these cell lines was little. <b>Fenugreek</b> <b>seeds</b> extract didn`t change the count and morphology of normal lymphocytes. These findings suggest significant antineoplastic effects of <b>Fenugreek</b> <b>seeds</b> against CCRF-HSB- 2 cell line. A strategy to selectively induce apoptosis of leukemia cells without altering healthy cells is a major goal for the development of new therapeutic techniques.

50|$|Sotolon (also {{known as}} sotolone) is a lactone and an {{extremely}} powerful aroma compound, with the typical smell of fenugreek or curry at high concentrations and maple syrup, caramel, or burnt sugar at lower concentrations. Sotolon {{is the major}} aroma and flavor component of <b>fenugreek</b> <b>seed</b> and lovage, {{and is one of}} several aromatic and flavor components of artificial maple syrup. It is also present in molasses, aged rum, aged sake and white wine, flor sherry, roast tobacco, and dried fruiting bodies of the mushroom Lactarius helvus. Sotolon can pass through the body relatively unchanged, and consumption of foods high in sotolon, such as fenugreek, can impart a maple syrup aroma to one's sweat and urine. In some individuals with the genetic disorder maple syrup urine disease, it is spontaneously produced in their bodies and excreted in their urine, leading to the disease's characteristic smell.|$|E

A method of manipulating colors evolved that employed various tools including rakes, combs, and other apparatus, utilized in a series of movements, resulted in incredibly elaborate, intricate, and mesmerizing designs. In India, the abri technique was eventually combined with aks, which are various methods of resist or stencils, to create unique and very rare form of miniature painting.
