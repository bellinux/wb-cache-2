For both kinds of juveniles, higher values of survival were seen in the experimental groups provided with either biofilm (B) {{or a combination of}} both <b>formulated</b> <b>food</b> and biofilm (B+F), compared to the group only receiving <b>formulated</b> <b>food</b> (F). Such higher survival was associated to a better water quality maintained by biofilm, in terms of low levels of both ammonium and nitrite, together with high levels of pH and dissolved oxygen. As for growing, specific growth rate was higher in the groups fed with <b>formulated</b> <b>food,</b> but only for early juveniles. Considering the crayfish biomass {{at the end of the}} experiment (i. e., an integrative index of both survival and growth), the best results were seen in the B+F group, for both kind of juveniles. The main micro-organisms present in biofilm were chlorophytas, xantophytas, pennate diatoms, cyanobacteria, flagellates, ciliates, rotifers and nematodes. Most of these items were found in the stomach of crayfishes fed on biofilm. The hepatopancreatic levels of total lipids were higher in animals of both B+F and F groups, compared to those of B group, while energetic reserves in the abdominal muscle showed no differences among experimental groups, for any kind of juveniles. Therefore, biofilm could be considered as a good complement for the culture system of C. quadricarinatus juveniles, mainly by improving survival through the maintenance of a good water quality.

40|$|ABSTRACT Background :  Deficiency in energy, {{protein and}} {{micronutrient}} of children under five years can cause growth faltering, besides the delayed in mental development and easily infected. Indonesia is highly potential in marine food sources, included fishes and seaweeds which {{are rich in}} macro and micronutrients. <b>Formulated</b> <b>food</b> made of fish were well accepted, but was not proven to improve growth significantly; while usage of seaweeds has not been explored. Objectives :  To produce <b>formulated</b> <b>food,</b> which contain macro and micronutrient that important for growth and mental development. The results will encourage usage of marine food sources and development of feasible food processing. Methods:  Food base included carbohydrate sources: rice flour, sweet corn, yellow yam, and sweet plaintain; protein sources: stingray, shark, tuna, greyfish and soybean. Sources of micronutrients were vegetables and seaweeds. Cooking oil and sugar were added to make 400 kCal energy content per 100 g formula and improve taste. Quality evaluation were tested: protein score, nutrient content, sensoric test and water absorbability of the <b>formulated</b> <b>food.</b> Results : Four kinds of formula were developed and well accepted by the panelist. Those formula have low water absorbtion and good sensoric quality. Protein scores are 84 - 97 %, {{higher than that of}} soybean. Content of folate, vitamin A, iodine and Zn per 100 g formula can fulfill 70 - 110 % daily allowance of children under five years old. Conclusions : <b>Formulated</b> <b>food</b> based on marine fishes and seaweeds were well accepted, with calculated protein scores were higher than soybean’s. Micronutrients content were high in all formula. There is a need to explore all potential benefits of the marine food sources, both protein sources and seaweeds, to develop other formulated foods for children.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{concept of}} {{enhancing}} saltiness perception in emulsions and a liquid food formulated with the emulsions (ambient vegetable soup) through increasing salt {{concentration in the}} continuous phase while retaining the fat content of the (aqueous continuous) product was evaluated. This was accomplished by increasing the droplet phase volume using duplex emulsion technology. Viscosity and droplet size distribution was measured. Saltiness evaluation was based on simple paired comparison testing (2 -Alternate Forced Choice tests, BS ISO 5495 : 2007). Results Single and duplex emulsions and emulsion-based products had comparable mean oil droplet diameters (25 to 30 [*]μm); however, viscosity of the duplex emulsion systems was considerably higher. Sensory assessment of saltiness of emulsion pairs (2 AFC) indicated duplex technology enhanced saltiness perception compared to a single emulsion product at the same salt content (6. 3 [*]g/ 100 [*]g) in both simple emulsions and the <b>formulated</b> <b>food</b> product (P [*]=[*] 0. 0596 and 0. 0004 respectively) although assessors noted the increased viscosity of the duplex systems. The <b>formulated</b> <b>food</b> product also contained pea starch particles which may have aided product mixing with saliva and thus accelerated tastant transport to the taste buds. Lowering salt content in the duplex systems (to levels of aqueous phase salt concentration similar to the level in the single systems) resulted in duplex systems being perceived as less salty than the single system. It appears that the higher viscosity of the duplex systems could not be “overruled” by enhanced mixing through increased droplet phase volume at lowered salt content. Conclusions The results showed that salt reduction may be possible despite the added technology of duplex systems increasing the overall measured viscosity of the product. The changes in viscosity behavior impact mouthfeel, which may be exploitable {{in addition to the}} contribution towards salt reduction. With a view to applying this technology to real processed foods, it needs to be tested for the product in question but it should be considered as part of a salt reduction tool box. </p...|$|E

40|$|Gelation is an {{important}} functional property of whey proteins. Their ability to form heat induced gels and provide appropriate texture is determined by its molecular structure (primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary), interactions with other components (salts, acids, urea) and processing conditions (pH, ionic strength, heating temperature, heating and cooling rate). The objective of this work was to define gel texture changes of whey protein isolates (WPI) at various pH values in function of following processing operations: tribomechanical activation and enzymatic hydrolysis. Whey protein gels were prepared by heating dispersions of two commercial powdered whey protein isolates before and after tribomechanical activation and enzymatic hydrolysis, respectively. The results obtained showed that tribomechanical activation as well as enzymatic hydrolysis influenced the gelation ability. Texture of gels was affected by pH. Gels prepared at pH 3 showed higher hardness than gels at pH 7.

A total of 214 cases aged between 6 and 24 months visiting two teaching hospitals, i. e., Sardjito hospital (n= 102) in Yogyakarta and Karyadi hospital (n= 112) in Semarang. Two cases from one hospital were dropped because they moved to other towns. In addition to their hospital food given during hospitalization and daily food at home, 72 cases were given tempe-based <b>formulated</b> <b>foods</b> with tempe produced traditionally (group TT), 72 were given tempe produced industrially (group IT), whereas a control group of 68 received soybean powder <b>formulated</b> <b>foods</b> (group IS). Formula feedings were started immediately following WHO (world health organization) standard oral rehydration therapy (ORT) and continued at the patients homes for up to 90 consecutive days, including feedings during hospitalization. Follow-up observations at patients homes were conducted twice weekly. The initial clinical characteristics of the cases in each group were similar. Using analysis of variance there was a non significant trend towards a shorter duration of diarrhea in the groups using tempe based formula (p= 0. 079). Using the t-test, the duration of diarrhea appeared to be significantly shorter only for the group using formula with traditional tempe compared with the group using soy formula (p= 0. 035). The total amount of feeding formula and {{the total amount of}} calories consumed at the hospital and at home was similar for all three groups, although the group receiving the control formula consumed a somewhat higher amount of breast milk (p= 0. 045) and a lower amount of solid food at home.

The consumption of green leafy vegetables is important to address micronutrients deficiency in rural communities and, at the same time, it contributes to fibre intake. This study investigated the people’s attitude towards the cultivation and utilisation of ILVs in rural communities. A cross-section survey study was conducted among 1 000 respondents in randomly selected households in communities. The majority of respondents were not willingly consuming ILVs. This is because most consumers were black and of the low-income group. ILVs that are consumed grow mainly in the wild.
