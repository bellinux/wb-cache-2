40|$|The {{requirements}} for edge protection systems on most sloped work surfaces (class C, according to EN 13374 - 2013 code) in construction works are studied in this paper. Maximum deceleration suffered by a falling body and maximum deflection of the protection system were analyzed through finite-element models and confirmed through full-scale experiments. The {{aim of this}} work is to determine which value for deflection system entails a safe deceleration for the human body. This value is compared with the requirements given by {{the current version of}} EN 13374 - 2013. An additional series of experiments were done to determine the acceleration linked to minimum deflection required by code (200 mm) during the retention process. According to the obtained results, a modification of this value is recommended. Additionally, a simple design formula for this <b>falling</b> <b>protection</b> system is proposed as a quick tool for the initial steps of design. B.

50|$|According to the {{photoprotection}} theory, anthocyanins {{protects the}} leaf against {{the harmful effects}} of light at low temperatures. Indeed, the leaves are about to <b>fall,</b> so <b>protection</b> is not of extreme importance for the tree. Photo-oxidation and photoinhibition, however, especially at low temperatures, make the process of reabsorbing nutrients less efficient. By shielding the leaf with anthocyanins, according to the photoprotection theory, the tree manages to reabsorb nutrients (especially nitrogen) more efficiently.|$|R

Methods: A descriptive study performed byinvestigation of computerized hospital records from patients undergoingrenal transplantation between July and December, 2004, in a largeprivate general hospital {{in the city of}} Sao Paulo. Collection of datawas carried out by means of an instrument that contains patientidentification data and a list of defining characteristics and relatedfactors/risk factors of nursing diagnosis, based on the most frequentcomplications reported in the literature, for patients in the immediatepostoperative period of renal transplantation. Results: Incidenceof 100 % of the following diagnoses: risk of fluid volume imbalance,risk of falls, risk of infection, risk of aspiration, inefficient protection,impaired bed mobility, impaired skin integrity, self-care deficit forbathing/hygiene.
