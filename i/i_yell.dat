6000|$|But he won't {{get out of}} the way. Also, {{whenever}} he is reproved for being in the wrong, he accuses Milda of it and bites the back of her neck. So bad has this become that whenever <b>I</b> <b>yell</b> [...] "Prince!" [...] in a loud voice, Milda immediately rabbit-jumps to the side, straight ahead, or sits down on the lead-bar. All of which is quite disconcerting. Picture it yourself. You are swinging round a sharp, down-grade, mountain curve, at a fast trot. The rock wall is the outside of the curve. The inside of the curve is a precipice. The continuance of the curve is a narrow, unrailed bridge. You hit the curve, throwing the leaders in against the wall and making the polo-horse do the work. All is lovely. The leaders are hugging the wall like nestling doves. But the moment comes in the evolution when the leaders must shoot out ahead. They really must shoot, or else they'll hit the wall and miss the bridge. Also, behind them are the wheelers, and the rig, and you have just eased the brake in order to put sufficient snap into the manoeuvre. If ever team-work is required, now is the time. Milda tries to shoot. She does her best, but Prince, bubbling over with roguishness, lags behind. He knows the trick. Milda is half a length ahead of him. He times it to the fraction of a second. Maid, in the wheel, over-running him, naturally bites him. This disturbs the Outlaw, who has been behaving beautifully, and she immediately reaches across for Maid. Simultaneously, with a fine display of firm conviction that it's all Milda's fault, Prince sinks his teeth into the back of Milda's defenceless neck. The whole thing has occurred in less than a second. Under the surprise and pain of the bite, Milda either jumps ahead to the imminent peril of harness and lead-bar, or smashes into the wall, stops short with the lead-bar over her back, and emits a couple of hysterical kicks. The Outlaw invariably selects this moment to remove paint. And after things are untangled and you have had time to appreciate the close shave, you go up to Prince and reprove him with your choicest vocabulary. And Prince, gazelle-eyed and tender, offers to shake hands with you for sugar. I leave it to any one: a boat would never act that way.|$|E

In November 1987, Michigan head coach Bo Schembechler said of Brown: [...] "I don't know if you like him or not, but that is one tough kid. And I don't know if he likes me all the time, because <b>I</b> <b>yell</b> at him. But I like him." ...|$|E

During his stint as {{coach of the}} ABA's Virginia Squires, Musselman [...] "antagonized so-called problem players...and docile ones," [...] according to a January 3, 1981, article in the New York Times.

5000|$|Farouk Razzak {{came out}} of the house to investigate. He saw [...] "like some shadow go towards the right, under the dark, the trees...suddenly I see two {{different}} persons.

I didn't run. I walk normal until I get the screen door, the screen door lock by itself. I put the handle and the bullets, I think it must miss my eyes maybe one millimetre and, my head, my everywhere. They stop me. I think second on the door, I can't move.

5000|$|The {{assassination}} {{is illustrated}} in the following excerpt from the book “Two shots for Pavelić” („Два метка за Павелића”): I went after him. Walking fast. Nearly running. I got close seven-eight meters. Pavelić sensed me, saw… He started shouting: “I fuck your Serbian-Jewish communist mother!” I hear the shot, don't know where it comes from. I’m not stopping. Running straight towards Pavelić. I came two-three meters {{away from him and}} then took a shot. Once. Twice! I shot him in the back, as he was running away. Two bullets got in to him. He falls down. As he was carrying the purse, it falls aside to a garden. He fells down, doesn’t move, I had to believe that he could be pretending to be dead, when two bullets hit him. At the moment, I'm thinking - perhaps it’s better to have him alive, because he’s going to a hospital, people will find out who he really was, and then he's going to face the trial. Do I beat him? And then I looked at that purse. His documents? It’d be nice to get them… But, if the money is in the purse, and then they catch me and say I’m a thief? And also that I killed him for the money! I'm gonna leave both Pavelić and his purse. Somebody is shouting: “They run, they run!” And shots are fired in my direction. I turn back and shoot towards that place. I shoot three times. I start running around the buildings in a semicircular street. People come out. They ask - what happened? Breathless I respond: “Look at those fools and what they're are doing there, drunk, and they shoot at everything!” “That guy is either drunk or crazy”, <b>I</b> <b>yell</b> so that the people on the windows could hear me. A gun was in my pocket. I left one bullet, just in case - picturesquely illustrates Jovović. Tihomir-Tiho Burzanović ...|$|E

We readily use this intuitive communication mechanism with our pets, with each other, and especially with our children. Robots are emerging that interact with everyday people in play, work, caregiving and hazardous situations. Pleo plays tug of war with its caretakers’ fingers, Roomba vacuums homes, disaster-relief robots will provide companionship to trapped victims, and intelligent wheelchairs promise to endow their users with greater independence from human caregivers. However, these robots understand neither what is said nor the important affective content of a shouted “no ” or a whispered “quiet. ” In this project, we aim to make robots sensitive and responsive to untrained, affective vocalizations, by recognizing acoustic patterns in our speech prosody, or tone of voice...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} {{the differences in the}} attributions clinically angry, at-risk of child maltreatment parents (CA), and non-angry, not at-risk of child maltreatment parents (NA) make for parent-child interactions. Participants were 82 families with a child aged 2 - 7 years. There were significant differences between the CA and NA mothers 2 ̆ 7 anger- intensifying attributional style for both negative and ambiguous negative child behaviour and anger-justifying attributions for negative parenting behaviour. The CA mothers reported an elevated level of anger-intensifying attributional style where the CA group tended to attribute negative and ambiguous negative child behaviour to internal and stable causes in the child and rated the behaviour as more intentional and blameworthy. CA mothers {{were also more likely to}} attribute blame to their child for their own negative parenting behaviour and perceive the reason for their behaviour was unlikely to change and that their behaviour was part of their personality (e. g. "That 2 ̆ 7 s the way I am. <b>I</b> <b>yell</b> and hit my children"). The study suggests that targeting parents 2 ̆ 7 anger-intensifying and anger-justifying attributions may enhance outcomes in parenting interventions and reduce the risk of child maltreatment...|$|E

60|$|He came up, {{throwing}} {{the water in}} angry spouts. If he did not threaten the boat I was crazy.

They held the cameras close, without trying to focus, facing the fish, and they snapped when <b>I</b> <b>yelled.</b> It was all gloriously exciting. I could never describe that exhibition. I only know that he leaped clear forty-six times, and after a swift, hard hour for me he got away. Strangely, I was almost happy that he had shaken loose, for he had given such remarkable opportunities for pictures.|$|R
