50|$|The MNR-MBL (an {{alliance}} between the centrist Revolutionary Nationalist Movement and the center-left <b>Free</b> <b>Bolivia</b> <b>Movement)</b> nominated former president Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada for the presidency.

50|$|The <b>Free</b> <b>Bolivia</b> <b>Movement</b> (Spanish: Movimiento Bolivia Libre) is a {{progressive}} political party in Bolivia.

50|$|In 1997, Fabricano {{offered to}} {{participate}} in national elections to represent the lowland indigenous movement; he also sought eight parliamentary seats for lowland indigenous groups.

40|$|Based on {{previous}} academic literature, relationships between non-governmental organizations and governments are categorized as being either generally cooperative or generally conflictual, and vary state to state. Considering {{an assumption that}} more freedom afforded to a state provides space in society for a more vibrant third sector, it seems intuitive that states with more freedom will experience more cooperative relationships with the NGO sector than states with less. However, six case studies illustrate that this {{may not always be}} a correct assumption. To test this hypothesis, Freedom House statuses between 1991 and 2011 are averaged to provide an overall status of <b>Free</b> (<b>Bolivia</b> and India), Partly Free (Ethiopia and Sierra Leone), or Not Free (Azerbaijan and Vietnam) for these cases studies. Rather than relying on a state 2 ̆ 7 s Freedom House status to forecast this relationship, this study finds that leadership policies and international influence also may impact the legal environment for NGOs...|$|R

500|$|Opposition to Morales' {{governance}} {{has centered}} in the wealthy eastern lowland province of Santa Cruz. His policies often antagonized middle-class Bolivians, who deemed them too radical and argued that they threatened private property. Morales' discourse of [...] "the people" [...] against the socio-economic elites has brought a spotlight on the deep social polarization in Bolivia. His most vociferous critics have been from <b>Bolivia's</b> conservative <b>movement,</b> although he has also received criticism from the country's far left, who believe his reformist policies have been insufficiently radical or socialist.|$|R
50|$|In 1993, Sánchez de Lozada again ran for president, {{this time}} in {{alliance}} with the Tupac Katari Revolutionary Liberation Movement (Movimiento Revolucionario Tupac Katari de Liberación, MRTKL), an indigenous party formed in 1985 whose leader Víctor Hugo Cárdenas was the candidate for vice-president. The MNR-MRTKL ticket won the first plurality with 36.5% of the popular vote, and Sánchez de Lozada was confirmed as president by Congress. A coalition government that included the center-left <b>Free</b> <b>Bolivia</b> <b>Movement</b> (MBL) and populist Civic Solidarity Union (UCS) was formed. With the 1993 electoral victory, Cárdenas became the first elected indigenous vice president in South America.|$|E
50|$|The left {{attempted}} a comeback following the disastrous {{experience of the}} UDP years. Headed by Antonio Aranibar's <b>Free</b> <b>Bolivia</b> <b>Movement,</b> the left grouped into a broad front labelled the United Left (IU). The IU brought together splinter factions of the MIR, the Socialist Party-1, and the Communist Party, and it counted on the support of organized labor, especially the COB. Given the historical divisions within the Bolivian left, however, the IU was not perceived {{to be a serious}} contender. If it could maintain unity beyond the 1989 elections, observers believed that its impact might be greater than anticipated.|$|E

His alternate was Félix García Cáceres. He served as president of the Defense Commission in parliament. In the 2002 parliamentary election, he again contested the No. 4 single-member constituency on behalf of MBL. He was defeated by a Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR) candidate by 5,800 to 5,600 votes. The MBL cried foul and claimed that there had been irregularities in the vote in the constituency. Three weeks later Aguirre Villafán and a group of local mayors left MBL to join the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR).

50|$|In 1978, the MIR {{joined the}} left-of-center UDP {{alliance}} {{of former president}} Hernán Siles Zuazo. After {{a few years of}} unstable military rule, Siles Zuazo was proclaimed Constitutional President in 1982, {{based on the results of}} the 1980 elections, which had been annulled by general Luis García Meza. The MIR's Jaime Paz Zamora accompanied Dr. Siles as his Vice-President. During the dire economic crisis that coincided with the coming to power of the UDP, Siles became considerably unpopular. At this point (1984), the MIR—led by Vice-President Paz Zamora—left the governing alliance and moved into the opposition. Prior to the 1985 elections, a faction of the party led by Antonio Araníbar left the party on ideological grounds and formed the rival <b>Free</b> <b>Bolivia</b> <b>Movement.</b> The faction of the MIR that remained loyal to Paz Zamora referred to itself as the MIR-New Majority, and espoused a much more moderate program than before, having disassociated itself from Marxist dogmas and any notion of class struggle.|$|E

Following these elections, because no presidential candidate had received a majority, the Congress chose the President, and they again elected Sánchez de Lozada. After the 2002 elections, the party ruled in a coalition with the Revolutionary Left Movement. In 2003 Sanchez was forced to resign, and his successor, independent candidate Carlos Mesa took over in hopes of promoting national unity in the face of nationwide protests. Mesa soon resigned and presidential elections were scheduled for December 2005. In these elections MNR received only 6.5% {{of the popular vote}} and won 7 out of 130 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 1 out of 27 seats in the Senate. Its candidate in the presidential elections was Michiaki Nagatani, whose poor performance demonstrated a steep decline in the fortunes of the party as the Bolivian political scene began to be dominated by Evo Morales.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the link between}} the logic of social movement and that of a political party in the case of indigenous <b>movements</b> in <b>Bolivia</b> and Ecuador. Specifically, it sought to explain why a movement capable of organizing plenty of protests, like the Ecuadorian, was unable to succeed in the electoral arena during the important 2007 elections to the Ecuadorian Constituent Assembly, while the fragmented Bolivian movements achieved some success by participating in a similar electoral scenario. The author argues that the relative success of <b>Bolivia’s</b> indigenous <b>movements</b> in the electoral arena was due to a greater ability of these groups to translate the support and strength originated in the field of social protest into the realm of institutional politics, and to combine institutional and non-institutional repertoires...|$|R

40|$|Bolivia's {{indigenous}} groups achieved an unprecedented level {{of political power}} {{in the latter half}} of the twentieth century. Traditional explanations for this phenomenon (elite alliances, deprivation, matter-of-time) have proven insufficient. This thesis argues that the ascendancy of Bolivia's groups can be best understood though he application of organization and social movement theories, and it uses the political economy framework as a backdrop. Data are drawn from scholarly analyses, official documents and historical texts. This thesis concludes that <b>Bolivia's</b> indigenous <b>movement</b> is not a single movement, but a coalition of many social movements. It demonstrates that ethnicity frameworks have in some cases hindered the progress of movements because of different understandings of ethnicity. Variegated interests, visions of the future, and geography, have exacerbated these differences. This thesis concludes with recommendations for strategic level policy-makers and tactical level operators...|$|R
40|$|I n {{the wake}} of the {{depression}} of 1929 there sprung up throughout Latin America a number of reformist political movements which today are generally lumped under the term National Populist Movements (Di Tella, 1965). Among the best known of these movements were Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana (APRA) in Peru, Accion Democratica (AD) in Venezuela, and Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario (MNR) in <b>Bolivia.</b> These <b>movements</b> projected themselves as sui generis Latin phenomena which would ~olve the problems of economic development and social justice in Latin America in a unique "national " way-neither socialist nor capitalist.

5000|$|The {{roots of}} MAS-IPSP {{can be traced}} to the {{closures}} of the Bolivian Mining Corporation and shut-down of various mines during the 1980s. Thousands of former miners became coca farmers as their means of survival, but also encountered new hardships in their new profession. The growth of the coca farmer community resulted in a sharp numerical growth of organizations such as Confederación Sindical Única de Trabajadores Campesinos de Bolivia (CSUTCB) and Confederación Sindical de Colonizadores de <b>Bolivia.</b> The <b>movement</b> built alliances with the Confederation of Indigenous Peoples of Eastern Bolivia (CIDOB), and mobilized joint protests in a 1992 campaign titled [...] "500 years of resistance of the indigenous peoples", culminating in a march to La Paz where a manifestation was held on October 12, 1992 (Columbus Day).
