40|$|Background. Frequencies of alloreactive T cells {{determined}} by limiting dilution assays (LDA) may not adequately reflect the donor-reactive immune status in transplant recipients. To reevaluate LDA frequencies, {{we developed a}} flow cytometry test for direct determination of alloreactive T-cell frequencies and compared these frequencies with classical LDA estimates of frequencies. Methods. For determination of frequencies by flow cytometry, peripheral blood lymphocytes (or lymphocytes taken from primary mixed lymphocyte culture) were stimulated with either Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines or T cell-depleted spleen cells and stained for intracellular interferon (IFN) -gamma production and CD 69. In lung transplant recipients, frequencies of IFN+ alloreactive T cells were compared with LDA frequencies, that is, cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursors and <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> precursors. Results. With flow cytometry, alloreactive T cells were detected after overnight allostimulation as IFN-gamma(+) CD 69 (bright) cells (range, 0. 1 - 0. 58 % and 0. 1 - 0. 66 % of total CD 4 and CD 8 cells, respectively). Frequencies increased 25 -fold or more when lymphocytes were prestimulated in primary mixed lymphocyte culture before testing. After lung transplantation, mean donor-specific IFN+ CD 8 T-cell frequencies did not decrease as mean donor-specific LDA cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursor frequencies, whereas no difference was seen in pretransplantation samples or third-party-specific frequencies at both time points. Mean frequencies of IFN+ CD 4 {{did not differ from}} <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> precursors at both time points, but frequencies did not correlate. Conclusions. The flow cytometry test allows a direct measurement of alloreactive T-cell frequencies and demonstrates a discrepancy between donor-specific IFN+ CD 8 T-cell frequencies and LDA CLTp after transplantation. This may be a result of the existence of "functional diverse" alloreactive T cells or of activation-induced cell death of donor-reactive T cells during long (LDA) culturing, which is avoided in the flow cytometry test...|$|E

40|$|Overview summary The {{immune system}} poses a major {{obstacle}} to the long-term success of in vivo gene therapies. Immune responses to foreign transgene products and/or the vectors that facilitate gene transfer may neutralize the transgene product, eliminate transfected cells, and culminate in inflammation within transfected tissues. The majority of studies that address these issues have focused on cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and antibody responses induced by gene transfer. However, the IL- 2 -producing <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> (HTL) represents a critical regulatory cell that likely influences the inductive phase of the immune response following gene transfer. The current study employed limiting dilution analysis (LDA) techniques to characterize the development of IL- 2 -producing HTLs induced by genetic vaccination with a plasmid encoding the mutated HIV protein Rev M 10. Further, we assessed the ability to inhibit the transgene-induced HTL response by cotransfer of a plasmid encoding the immunosuppressive cytokine TGFβ 1...|$|E

40|$|Many of the {{mechanisms}} proposed to explain proliferating or <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> recognition of exogenous antigens are predicted {{on the four}} following basic observations: (a) soluble antigen alone fails to stimulate T cells (1); (b) antigen-specific T cell stimulation depends on accessory cells, which in the guinea pig are macrophage-like (1 - 3); (c) T cell stimulation is genetically restricted for the Ia antigens expressed by the accessory cell (4 - 9); and (d) Ir gene function is correlated with Ia expression by accessory cells (10 - 14). The various hypotheses accommodating these observations seem to fall into two general categories. The first category encompasses determinant selection-type proposals (15 - 17). For antigens not under Ir gene control, determinant selection suggests that accessory cell Ia antigens bind exogenous antigen, where different Ia species bind different antigenic regions, and that T cells express a single antigen-combining receptor that interacts with distinct antigenic determinants of the exogenous antigen.

Decreased {{in vitro}} T cell alloreactivity, {{demonstrated}} by decreased frequencies of peripheral blood donor-specific T cell precursors, {{may reflect a}} tolerant state after transplantation and lower the risk for development of chronic graft dysfunction. It is unknown whether a decrease in donor-specific T cell frequencies also occurs after clinical lung transplantation and if such a decrease lowers the risk for bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), a hallmark of chronic graft dysfunction. Therefore, we compared changes in posttransplant donor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTLp) and <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> precursor (HTLp) frequencies in lung allograft recipients with good graft function and in recipients with BOS. Methods. Donor and third party specific CTLp and HTLp frequencies were determined by limiting dilution assay in pre- and posttransplant (1 year) peripheral blood samples of lung allograft recipients with good graft function (n= 13) and BOS (n= 10). Results. In recipients with good graft function, mean donor-specific CTLp frequencies decreased after transplantation (183 vs. 16 precursors before and after transplantation, respectively). Additionally, HTLp frequencies decreased {{but this was not}} specific for donor alloantigens because third party-specific HTLp frequencies decreased also. Surprisingly, recipients with BOS also showed a decrease in mean donor-specific CTLp frequencies after transplantation (332 vs. 49 precursors before and after transplantation, respectively). Again, HTLp frequencies decreased nonspecifically. Conclusions. We conclude that donor-specific CTLp frequencies decrease after lung transplantation, but that this does not result in transplantation tolerance protecting the lung against the development of chronic graft dysfunction...|$|E
40|$|Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is {{the most}} serious {{complication}} following bone marrow transplantation, with an incidence of 40 - 60 %. The disease can be fatal in 50 % of cases, even in patients receiving marrow from an HLA identical sibling. Several assays have been developed to try to predict the development of GVHD, including mixed lymphocyte culture reaction, cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursor, and <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> precursor frequency assays. This review describes an in vitro skin explant model which has been used since 1988 for both predicting acute GVHD in HLA identical sibling bone marrow transplantation and studying the pathophysiology of the disease. The model involves sensitising donor lymphocytes in vitro in a primary mixed lymphocyte reaction and then evaluating the secondary response on patient skin biopsies by grading the graft-versus-host reactivity (grades I-IV) histopathologically. From analysis of collective data the model is a clear predictor of GVHD and superior to the other assays widely used, with a correlation of 82 % with clinical outcome. The skin explant model allows the investigator to study the pathogenesis of GVHD. The cytokines TNF alpha and IFN gamma are shown to be important mediators of cellular damage in graft-versus-host reactions. Recent work has also involved using the model to study the alloreactivity of cord blood. The model is currently being assessed in several bone marrow transplantation centres in Europe on different patient groups including those who receive marrow from haploidentical and matched unrelated donors...|$|E
40|$|<b>Helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> are master {{regulators}} of {{the adaptive}} immune response.

Here, I discuss which signals control <b>T</b> <b>helper</b> cell lineage commitment, how these multiple signals are integrated during the polarisation process and subsequent cross-regulatory mechanisms that effectuate lineage stabilisation, affording {{new insights into the}} role of T cell receptor-mediated and co-stimulatory signals in <b>T</b> <b>helper</b> cell polarisation and the role of suppressors of cytokine signalling (SOCS) family members in lineage stabilisation...|$|R
40|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} that regulatory <b>helper</b> and suppressor <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> {{play a critical}} role in determining the magnitude and nature of a variety of immune responses. Different lines of experiments indicate that T ceils recognize not only surface-bound antigens, but also idiotypic (1, 2) and allotypic (3) determinants on <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> cells and/or B lymphocytes. In addition, it is clear that the antigenrecognition function of several classes of <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> including <b>helper</b> cells, cytolytic <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> (CTL) 1, and the effector cells of delayed hypersensitivity (4), is restricted by the major histocompatibility gene complex (MHC). The MHCrestricted collaboration between antigen-specific <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> and B <b>lymphocytes</b> (5, 6) implies that antigen-specific T cells recognize receptor-bound antigen in some form of an association with MHC gene products, although it is difficult to demonstrate directly such an associative recognition mechanism in normal immune-cell populations. The possibility that hapten-specific, MHC-restricted CTL (7) can function as regulators of anti-hapten immune responses has been raised by several investigators, although this has not been experimentally verified to date (8).

40|$|An {{essential}} element {{in our current}} understanding {{of the structure of}} the immunoglobulin molecule, the organization of the immunoglobulin gene complex, and the regulatory influences on B lymphocyte function has been the availability of monoclonal antibody populations derived from myeloma protein-producing plasmacytomas. In contrast, progress in the study of the antigen recognition structures on <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> and the factors that regulate <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> function has proceeded more slowly, probably in part as a result of the necessity of using heterogeneous <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> populations for these analyses.
