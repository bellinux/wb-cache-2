50|$|Photoreceptor {{cells are}} unusual cells {{in that they}} {{depolarize}} in response to absence of stimuli or scotopic conditions (darkness). In photopic conditions (light), photoreceptors hyperpolarize to a potential of -60mV. It is this 'switching off' that activates the next cell and sends an <b>excitatory</b> <b>signal</b> down the neural pathway.|$|E

50|$|Chemical {{synaptic}} {{transmission is}} {{the transfer of}} neurotransmitters or neuropeptides from a presynaptic axon to a postsynaptic dendrite. Unlike an electrical synapse, the chemical synapses are separated by a space called the synaptic cleft, typically measured between 15 and 25 nm. Transmission of an <b>excitatory</b> <b>signal</b> involves several steps outlined below.|$|E
5000|$|Other methods {{from this}} group vary this basic {{approach}} of Mick in different ways. In Sinha’s [...] method resonant {{frequency of the}} skull bones is determined first, then a sinusoidal excitation at the resonant frequency is delivered through a piezo-transducer, and ICP is calculated directly from the phase difference between the <b>excitatory</b> <b>signal</b> and response detected with a second transducer. Yost and Cantrell [...] divided the process into two steps. In the first step, changes in the circumference of the cranium are calculated from the phase difference between a sinusoidal <b>excitatory</b> <b>signal,</b> delivered with a piezo-transducer, and the response that is received at a distance with another piezotransducer. In the second step, changes in ICP are calculated {{as a product of}} the changes in the cranium circumference and the elasticity constant of the skull that has been determined earlier by causing known changes in ICP while measuring the cranium circumference.|$|E
50|$|In many animals, {{including}} human beings, {{the inner}} ear functions as the biological analogue of an accelerometer in camera image stabilization systems, to stabilize the image by moving the eyes. When a rotation of the head is detected, an inhibitory signal {{is sent to the}} extraocular muscles on one side and an <b>excitatory</b> <b>signal</b> to the muscles on the other side. The result is a compensatory movement of the eyes. Typically eye movements lag the head movements by less than 10 ms.|$|E

He discovered that the Y cell collected <b>excitatory</b> <b>signals</b> from many small spatial mechanisms called “nonlinear subunits” {{and that there was}} a contrast gain control, a nonlinear feedback within the retina that adjusted the signal-transfer properties of the retina contingent on the space-averaged stimulus contrast.|$|R
50|$|The four deep nuclei of the {{cerebellum}} are the dentate, emboliform, globose, and fastigii nuclei {{and they}} act as the main centers of communication, sending and receiving information to and from specific parts of the brain. In addition, these nuclei receive both inhibitory and <b>excitatory</b> <b>signals</b> {{from other parts of}} the brain which in turn affect the nuclei's outgoing signals.(The globose and the emboliform nuclei make up the interposed nucleus).|$|R
50|$|Gating {{can occur}} by {{shunting}} inhibition in which inhibitory interneurons change the membrane conductance of an excitatory target axon, thereby diffusing its <b>excitatory</b> <b>signal.</b> A gating {{signal from the}} gatekeeper triggers these inhibitory interneurons {{in order to prevent}} one set of neurons from firing even when stimulated by another set. In this state, the gate is closed. Examples of this kind of gating have been found in visual cortical neurons and areas of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in primates that may be responsible for suppressing irrelevant stimuli. Studies suggest that this kind of inhibition can be attributed in part to GABA receptor-mediated synapses.|$|E
50|$|This <b>excitatory</b> <b>signal,</b> however, {{will only}} be {{transmitted}} by the rod cells {{in the center of}} the Ganglion cell receptive field to ganglion cells because horizontal cells respond by sending an inhibitory signal to the neighboring rods to create a balance that allows mammals to perceive more vivid images. The retinal ganglion cells will still receive an excitatory neural response but only from the center rod. The central rod will send its excitatory neural response directly to bipolar cells which in turn will relay the signal to the ganglion cells. This inhibition produced by horizontal cells creates a more concentrated and balanced signal for the retinal ganglion cells to send to the cerebral cortex through the optic nerve.|$|E
50|$|These interneurons are {{connected}} to one another via synapses and a minority, approximately 15% of the neurons, exhibit bidirectional capacity and were excitatory. About 77% of these neurons indicated a one-way mode of transmitting signals which were inhibitory in nature. These numbers were modeled from an arthropod as pre-motor elements in the motor control system. They were located in the abdominal region. Synapses are known as gaps between neurons which facilitate the spread of a message via neurotransmitters that may excite or depress the subsequent neuron through a complex cascade of electrochemical events. For the interneurons exhibiting one-way signaling, they would receive an excitatory stimulus, experimentally, and the post-synaptic cell was given an inhibitory signal. The interaction between the two cells was modulatory in which the pre-synaptic cell with the initial <b>excitatory</b> <b>signal</b> would mediate the postsynaptic cell even after being inhibited. Signal amplitude {{was used to determine}} the effects of the modulation on the signal transmission.|$|E
5000|$|... ipRGCs {{are both}} pre- and postsynaptic to dopaminergic {{amacrine}} cells (DA cells) via reciprocal synapses, with ipRGCs sending <b>excitatory</b> <b>signals</b> to the DA cells and the DA cells sending inhibitory {{signals to the}} ipRGCs. These inhibitory signals are mediated through GABA which is co-released from the DA cells along with dopamine. Dopamine has functions in the light adaptation process by up-regulating melanopsin transcription in ipRGCs and thus increasing the photoreceptor's sensitivity.|$|R
50|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the opiate reward is mediated by a dopamine-independent reward system in nondependent animals, and by a dopamine-dependent reward system in dependent animals. In the present study, infusions of BDNF into the VTA were able to shift opiate reward from a dopamine-independent system to a dopamine-dependent system. This switch is mediated through a specific change in GABA-A receptors in the VTA from inhibitory to <b>excitatory</b> <b>signaling</b> in response to increased BDNF.|$|R
40|$|In this model, each neuron {{has four}} {{excitatory}} outputs and is randonly connected with other neurons. When the neuron fires, it sends out four <b>excitatory</b> <b>signals,</b> and it stimulates other four neurons (include itself). In the next time, other neurons fire when its' membrane potential exceed {{the values of}} its' threshold. In this way these circuits repeat firing. The values of threshold are decided artificially. This paper denotes an effect {{of the relation between}} threshold and firing phenomena...|$|R
5000|$|There is a {{need for}} some {{mechanism}} that stabilises images during rapid head movements. This is achieved by the vestibulo-ocular reflex, which is a reflex eye movement that stabilises images on the retina by producing eye movements in the direction opposite to head movements, thus preserving the image on the centre of the visual field. For example, when the head moves to the right, the eyes move to the left, and vice versa. In many animals, including human beings, the inner ear functions as the biological analogue of an accelerometer in camera image stabilization systems, to stabilize the image by moving the eyes. When a rotation of the head is detected, an inhibitory signal is sent to the extraocular muscles on one side and an <b>excitatory</b> <b>signal</b> to the muscles on the other side. The result is a compensatory movement of the eyes. Typical human eye movements lag head movements by less than 10 ms.|$|E

As used here, 'vector measurement system" signifies an instrumentation system that applies a radio-frequency (RF) excitation to an object of interest and measures the resulting amplitude and phase response, relative to either the applied <b>excitatory</b> <b>signal</b> or another reference signal related in a known way to applied <b>excitatory</b> <b>signal...</b>|$|E

The etiology of many severe childhood movement disorders and epilepsies remains uncharacterized. We describe a neurological disorder with epilepsy and prominent choreoathetosis caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in FRRS 1 L, which encodes an AMPA receptor outer-core protein. Loss of FRRS 1 L function attenuates AMPA-mediated currents, implicating chronic abnormalities of glutamatergic neurotransmission in this monogenic neurological disease of childhood...|$|R
50|$|There is a copious {{amount of}} {{glutamate}} in mammalian cells. Glutamate {{is necessary for}} <b>excitatory</b> <b>signaling</b> between neurons. The release must be highly organized, due to the large amounts of glutamate at the synaptic cleft, {{and the fact that}} it is released at high speeds. This mechanism of release at the synaptic cleft is partially controlled through the active transport of glutamate out of astrocytes by system Xc-. This release also has a physiological role in the regulation of glutamate metabotropic receptors and control of other neurotransmitters.|$|R
40|$|Deep brain {{stimulation}} (DBS) of the {{subthalamic nucleus}} (STN) improves motor function {{in patients with}} Parkinson’s disease (PD). STN-DBS enables similar improved motor function, including increased movement speed (reduced bradykinesia), in the 6 -OHDA dopamine-depletion mouse model of PD. Previous analyses of electrophysiological recordings from STN and motor cortex (M 1) have explored signaling changes that correspond to PD and amelioration of PD symptoms. The most common results show an increase in beta frequency power during ‘off’ states {{and a reduction in}} beta during ‘on’ states. Surprisingly, however, few studies have analyzed whole signal measures of amplitude and coherence during stimulation in freely moving subjects. In previous work by the author, specific transfection of layer five motor cortex projections to the STN revealed an axonal network with collaterals reaching to multiple non-dopaminergic subcortical areas of the brain. The large excitatory shift that stimulation of this axonal network could potentially induce inspired the current study’s hypothesis that amplification of <b>excitatory</b> <b>signaling</b> occurs during stimulation of cortico-subthalamic projections. The results show that, in awake mice, (1) the root-mean-square amplitudes of STN and M 1 local field potentials (LFPs) are significantly decreased ipsilateral to chronic unilateral 6 -OHDA lesions, (2) stimulation of cortico-subthalamic projections increases the amplitude of M 1 - and STN-LFPs, and 3) M 1 -LFP amplitude correlates strongly with locomotion speed in lesioned mice. Together, these findings demonstrate that bradykinesia-reducing stimulation of cortico-subthalamic projections amplifies both cortical and subcortical motor circuit activity in unilaterally dopamine-depleted mice. Most PD treatments are focused on increasing dopamine in the dorsal striatum. However, in this study, stimulation of layer five cortico-subthalamic glutamatergic axons that do not directly project to dopaminergic neurons increased movement and amplified cortico-subthalamic <b>excitatory</b> <b>signaling</b> in dopamine-depleted mice. The correlation between M 1 -LFP amplitude and locomotion speed observed in these mice points to a role for upregulated hyperdirect pathway <b>excitatory</b> <b>signaling</b> in bradykinesia amelioration. In addition to providing insight into the elusive mechanisms of DBS, these motor circuit amplification relationships suggest that specific manipulation of NMDA, AMPA, and/or metabotropic glutamate receptors in the hyperdirect pathway may be beneficial for upregulating signaling and movement in PD...|$|R

40|$|Ionotropic {{glutamate}} receptors (iGluRs) are tetrameric ligand-gated cation {{channels that}} mediate <b>excitatory</b> <b>signal</b> transmission {{in the central}} nervous system (CNS) of vertebrates. The members of the iGluR subfamily of α-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors (AMPARs) mediate most of the fast <b>excitatory</b> <b>signal</b> transmission, and their abundance in the postsynaptic membrane is a major determinant of the strength of excitatory synapses. Therefore, regulation of AMPAR trafficking to the postsynaptic membrane is an important constituent of mechanisms involved in learning and memory formation, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). Auxiliary subunits {{play a critical role in}} the facilitation and regulation of AMPAR trafficking and function. The currently identified auxiliary subunits of AMPARs are transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs), suppressor of lurcher (SOL), cornichon homologues (CNIHs), synapse differentiation-induced gene I (SynDIG I), cysteine-knot AMPAR modulating proteins 44 (CKAMP 44), and germ cell-specific gene 1 -like (GSG 1 L) protein.

40|$|Addiction is {{a chronic}} {{relapsing}} disorder hypothesized {{to be produced}} by drug-induced plasticity that renders individuals vulnerable to craving-inducing stimuli such as re-exposure to the drug of abuse. Drug-induced plasticity that may result in the addiction phenotype includes increased <b>excitatory</b> <b>signaling</b> within corticostriatal pathways that correlates with craving in humans and is necessary for reinstatement in rodents. Reduced cystine–glutamate exchange by system xc– appears to contribute to heightened <b>excitatory</b> <b>signaling</b> within the striatum, thereby posing this as a novel target {{in the treatment of}} addiction. In the present report, we examined the impact of repeated N-acetyl cysteine, which is commonly used to activate cystine–glutamate exchange, on reinstatement in rodents in a preclinical study and on craving in cocaine-dependent humans in a preliminary, proof-of-concept clinical experiment. Interestingly, repeated administration (7 days) of N-acetyl cysteine (60 [*]mg/kg, IP) produced a significant reduction in cocaine (10 [*]mg/kg, IP) -induced reinstatement, even though rats (N= 10 – 12 /group) were tested 24 [*]h after the last administration of N-acetyl cysteine. The reduction in behavior despite the absence of the N-acetyl cysteine indicates that repeated N-acetyl cysteine may have altered drug-induced plasticity that underlies drug-seeking behavior. In parallel, our preliminary clinical data indicate that repeated administration (4 days) of N-acetyl cysteine (1200 – 2400 [*]mg/day) to cocaine-dependent human subjects (N= 4 per group) produced a significant reduction in craving following an experimenter-delivered IV injection of cocaine (20 [*]mg/ 70 [*]kg/ 60 [*]s).

50|$|The neurons {{present in}} the global pallidus and substantia nigra are the main output areas of the basal ganglia. These efferent neurons {{influence}} activity of the upper motor neurons. Neurons in these areas are GABAergic, and thus the main output of the basal ganglia is inhibitory, and spontaneous activation of these neurons consistently prevents unwanted movement. The input of medium spiny neurons to these output areas of the basal ganglia are also GABAergic and therefore inhibitory. The net effect of excitatory inputs to the basal ganglia from the cortex is inhibition (via the medium spiny neurons) of the persistently active inhibitory cells in the output center of the basal ganglia. This double inhibitory effect leads to activation of upper motor neurons, which causes subsequent signaling of local-circuit and lower motor neurons to initiate movement. This pathway {{is defined as the}} direct pathway through the basal ganglia. There is another indirect pathway present between the corpus striatum and part of the globus pallidus. This indirect pathway also involves the subthalamic nucleus (a part of the thalamus), which receives signals from the cerebral cortex. <b>Excitatory</b> <b>signals</b> from the cortex will activate subthalamic neurons, which are excitatory also. Thus, this indirect pathway serves to reinforce inhibition by <b>excitatory</b> <b>signals</b> to the GABAergic cells {{present in the}} globus pallidus. In effect, this pathway regulates the direct pathway by feeding back onto the output centers of the basal ganglia. The balance between these two pathways processes movement signals and influences the initiation of an impending movement.|$|R
