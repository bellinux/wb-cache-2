40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to offer a {{comprehensive}} commentary of the choice-of-court agreements under the Brussels <b>I</b> <b>bis</b> regulations and the 2005 Convention on Choice of Court Agreements ("Convention") and {{to refer to the}} main problems which may arise during the application of these instruments to the disputes arising from relationships in which the choice- of-court agreement was concluded. The paper is composed of five main chapters. The first four chapters deal with the framework of the Brussels <b>I</b> <b>bis,</b> the fifth chapter illustrates the rules of the Convention. Chapter one is dedicated to the fundamental characteristics of the Brussels <b>I</b> <b>bis.</b> It compares the rules contained therein with the previous legislation, analyses its principles and purposes, the interpretation of the terms contained therein and the relation to the other instruments. Chapter two deals with the detailed analysis of the choice-of-court agreements under the Brussels <b>I</b> <b>bis,</b> particularly with the scope of effect of art. 25, the effect of jurisdictional agreements, their characteristics, formalities necessary for their creations, their extent, forms, formal and material validity, cases where the Brussels <b>I</b> <b>bis</b> restricts the effect of the choice-of-court agreements and the consequences of such violation.

40|$|On January 10 th 2015 the new Brussels I Regulation {{entered into}} force (hereinafter {{referred}} to as the Brussels <b>I</b> (<b>bis)</b> -regulation). One of the main changes that is introduced by this Regulation is the new lis pendens rule. Under the old Brussels I regulation, the court first seized has to decide upon its jurisdiction. Other courts have to stay proceedings until the court first seized decided upon this issue. This rule is also incorporated in carriage law conventions, such as CMR, COTIF-CIM, the Montreal Convention, the Hamburg convention and the Rotterdam Rules. A problem with this lis pendens rule is that it allows using of the abusive litigation tactics, such as the so-called Italian Torpedo where a claim is brought before an incompetent court, in order to slow down the proceedings. The Brussels <b>I</b> (<b>bis)</b> aims to bring such tactics to a stop in cases where an exclusive forum choice has been made. In such situations, the court named in the exclusive jurisdiction clause can continue the proceedings, irrespective of the question whether another court has been seized first. This new rule envisages more efficient legal proceedings. As several carriage conventions have their own procedural rules, the question under investigation in this article is whether the Brussel <b>I</b> (<b>bis)</b> will impact carriage contracts and whether such impact will indeed contribute to legal certainty in the field of carriage law. After introducing the changes that were brought to the lis pendens rule by the Brussels I(bis) Regulation {{and the extent to which}} this matter is governed in transport conventions this article inquires into whether these modifications might lead to parallel proceedings (title II), and what the future for procedural rules in carriage conventions is after the Brussels (I) Bis Regulation (title III). status: publishe...|$|R
