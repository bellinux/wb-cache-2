Timur's conquests devastated most Assyrian bishoprics and destroyed the 4000-year-old city of Assur, which was the cultural and religious capital of the Church of the East and its followers. After the destruction brought on by Timur, the massive and organized Nestorian Church structure, which at its peak extended as far as China, Central Asia, Mongolia and India, was largely reduced to its region of origin (with {{the exception of the}} Saint Thomas Christians in India), and stayed as such until the Assyrian genocide, when a large portion of this region was entirely ethnically and culturally cleansed of its <b>endemic</b> <b>population,</b> and in effect also ended the Shimun Branch, which had to reestablished itself in America up until 2015 when they established their new see in Erbil.

5000|$|Bats {{have evolved}} to use {{echolocation}} to detect and catch their prey. Moths have in turn evolved to detect the echolocation calls of hunting bats, and evoke evasive flight maneuvers, or reply with their own ultrasonic clicks to confuse the bat's echolocation. The Arctiidae subfamily of Noctuid moths uniquely respond to bat echolocation in three prevailing hypotheses: startle, sonar jamming, and acoustic aposematic defense. All these differences depend on specific environmental settings {{and the type of}} echolocation call; however, these hypotheses are not mutually exclusive and can be used by the same moth for defense. The different defense mechanisms {{have been shown to be}} directly responsive to bat echolocation through sympatry studies. In places with spatial or temporal isolation between bats and their prey, the moth species hearing mechanism tends to regress. Fullard et al. (2004) compared adventive and endemic Noctiid moth species in a bat-free habitat to ultrasound and found that all of the adventive species reacted to the ultrasound by slowing their flight times, while only one of the endemic species reacted to the ultrasound signal, indicating a loss of hearing over time in the <b>endemic</b> <b>population.</b> However, the degree of loss or regression depends on the amount of evolutionary time and whether or not the moth species has developed secondary uses for hearing. Some bats are known to use clicks at frequencies above or below moths' hearing ranges. This is known as the allotonic frequency hypothesis. It argues that the auditory systems in moths have driven their bat predators to use higher or lower frequency echolocation to circumvent the moth hearing.Barbastelle bats {{have evolved to}} use a quieter mode of echolocation, calling at a reduced volume and further reducing the volume of their clicks as they close in on prey moths. The lower volume of clicks reduces the effective successful hunting range, but results in a significantly higher number of moths caught than other, louder bat species.|$|E

40|$|One {{half million}} {{patients}} suffer from colorectal cancer in industrialized nations, yet this disease exhibits a low incidence in under-developed countries. This geographic imbalance suggests an environmental {{contribution to the}} resistance of <b>endemic</b> <b>populations</b> to intestinal neoplasia. A common epidemiological characteristic of these colon cancer-spared regions is the prevalence of enterotoxigenic bacteria associated with diarrheal disease. Here, a bacterial heat-stable enterotoxin was demonstrated to suppress colon cancer cell proliferation by a guanylyl cyclase C-mediated signaling cascade. The heat-stable enterotoxin suppressed proliferation by increasing intracellular cGMP, an effect mimicked by the cell-permeant analog 8 -br-cGMP. The antiproliferative effects of the enterotoxin and 8 -br-cGMP were reversed by L-cis-diltiazem, a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel inhibitor, {{as well as by}} removal of extracellular Ca 2 +, or chelation of intracellular Ca 2 +. In fact, both the enterotoxin and 8 -br-cGMP induced an L-cis-diltiazem-sensitive conductance, promoting Ca 2 + influx and inhibition of DNA synthesis in colon cancer cells. Induction of this previously unrecognized antiproliferative signaling pathway by bacterial enterotoxin could contribute to the resistance of <b>endemic</b> <b>populations</b> to intestinal neoplasia, and offers a paradigm for targeted prevention and therapy of primary and metastatic colorectal cancer...|$|R

40|$|The large {{forest fires}} {{in and around}} Yellowstone National Park in 1988 bring up many {{ecological}} questions, including the role of bark beetles. Bark beetles may contribute to fuel buildup over the years preceding a fire, resulting in stand replacement fires. Fire {{is important to the}} survival of seral tree species and bark beetles that reproduce in them. Without fire, seral species are ultimately replaced by climax species.

However, <b>endemic</b> <b>populations</b> of beetles, beetle infestation in 1988 was not observed in fire-injured trees.

Carroll 1 Abstract—Mountain pine beetle (MPB) Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) attacks and overwhelms the defences of vigorous trees during outbreaks by attacking en masse. Low or endemic populations are regulated by host resistance and restricted to colonising weakened trees, {{where there is a}} potential trade off between tree defences and habitat quality. Mountain pine beetle populations are typically in the <b>endemic</b> <b>population</b> phase, but MPB attack behaviour and brood productivity in this phase are poorly understood. We located attacks made by beetles from endemic populations in north-central Alberta, Canada and examined galleries constructed on these trees. The distribution of gallery starts on trees was clustered relative to height on the tree, but not related to aspect on the tree bole. We found no Allee effect associated with mate location as over 99 % of galleries were constructed by mated females.
