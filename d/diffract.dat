5|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} is {{a technique}} used for determining the atomic and molecular structure of a crystal, in which the crystalline atoms cause a beam of incident X-rays to <b>diffract</b> into many specific directions. By measuring the angles and intensities of these diffracted beams, a crystallographer can produce a three-dimensional picture of the density of electrons within the crystal. From this electron density, the mean positions of the atoms in the crystal can be determined, {{as well as their}} chemical bonds, their disorder, and various other information.|$|E

25|$|Crystals {{with simple}} {{structure}} tend {{to give the}} best diffraction performance. Crystals containing heavy atoms can <b>diffract</b> well, but also fluoresce themselves, causing interference. Crystals that are water-soluble, volatile or organic tend to give poor stability.|$|E
50|$|When {{a crystal}} is {{composed}} of crystallites with varying lattice orientation, topographic contrast arises: In plane-wave topography, only selected crystallites will be in <b>diffracting</b> position, thus yielding <b>diffracted</b> intensity only {{in some parts of}} the image. Upon sample rotation, these will disappear, and other crystallites will appear in the new topograph as strongly <b>diffracting.</b> In white-beam topography, all misoriented crystallites will be <b>diffracting</b> simultaneously (each at a different wavelength). However, the exit angles of the respective <b>diffracted</b> beams will differ, leading to overlapping regions of enhanced intensity as well as to shadows in the image, thus again giving rise to contrast.|$|R
40|$|A shared counter is a {{concurrent}} {{object that}} provides a fetch-and-increment operation in a distributed system. Recently, <b>diffracting</b> trees have been introduced as an efficient way of implementing shared counters in heavily loaded systems. <b>Diffracting</b> trees dynamically distribute processors into small groups that can access a collection of disjoint local counters quickly in a globally coordinated way. Their empirical performance under heavy load surpasses all other shared counter implementations. However, <b>diffracting</b> trees of differing depths are optimal for only a limited load range. There would thus be great bene t in designing a <b>diffracting</b> tree algorithm that would effectively scale from a simple cetralized queue-lock based counter at low loads to the optimal size <b>diffracting</b> tree counter as the load increases/decreases.

40|$|A shared counter is a {{concurrent}} object {{which provides}} the fetch-and-increment operation on a distributed system. Recently, <b>diffracting</b> trees {{have been introduced}} as shared counters which work well under high load. They efficiently divide high loads into lower loads that can quickly access lock-based counters that share the overall counting. Their throughputs have surpassed all other shared counters when heavily loaded. However, <b>diffracting</b> trees of differing depths are optimal for only a short load range. The ideal algorithm would scale from the simple queue-lock based counter to a collection of counters with a mechanism (such as a <b>diffracting</b> tree) to distribute the load. In this thesis, we present the dynamic <b>diffracting</b> tree, an object similar to a <b>diffracting</b> tree, but which can expand and collapse to better handle current access patterns and the memory layout of the object's data structure, providing true scalability and locality.

25|$|Diffraction {{phenomena}} {{by small}} obstacles {{are also important}} at high frequencies. Signals for urban cellular telephony tend {{to be dominated by}} ground-plane effects as they travel over the rooftops of the urban environment. They then <b>diffract</b> over roof edges into the street, where multipath propagation, absorption and diffraction phenomena dominate.|$|E
25|$|Knife-edge {{diffraction}} is {{the propagation}} mode where radio waves are bent around sharp edges. For example, this mode {{is used to}} send radio signals over a mountain range when a line-of-sight path is not available. However, the angle cannot be too sharp or the signal will not <b>diffract.</b> The diffraction mode requires increased signal strength, so higher power or better antennas will be needed than for an equivalent line-of-sight path.|$|E
25|$|Diffraction {{depends on}} the {{relationship}} between the wavelength {{and the size of the}} obstacle. In other words, the size of the obstacle in wavelengths. Lower frequencies <b>diffract</b> around large smooth obstacles such as hills more easily. For example, in many cases where VHF (or higher frequency) communication is not possible due to shadowing by a hill, it is still possible to communicate using the upper part of the HF band where the surface wave is of little use.|$|E
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of a concave diffraction grating {{in a given}} order is obtained by measuring the intensities of the <b>diffracted</b> and incident beams and taking their ratio. A valid measurement requires that both the incident and <b>diffracted</b> beams be collected by the detector. At grazing incidence, however, the <b>diffracted</b> beam may spread beyond the detector due to aberrations. In addition, the <b>diffracted</b> beams of consecutive orders may overlap so that unambiguous efficiency measurements cannot be made. The effect of aberrations on efficiency measurements has been studied, using ray tracing, for the geometry of the measuring instrument in use at the Naval Research Laboratory. This instrument {{is attached to a}} VUV monochromator which furnishes a diverging beam. The main effect of aberrations for this instrument is a spread of the <b>diffracted</b> beam in the direction of dispersion. The width of the <b>diffracted</b> beam is wavelength dependent and is minimal at the horizontal focus, spreading to longer and shorter wavelengths. Reducing the divergence of the incident beam reduces the spread but, for small radius gratings, not always sufficiently so that the entire <b>diffracted</b> beam can be collected by the detector. The distance from the detector to the grating can also be adjusted to aid in collecting all the <b>diffracted</b> beam...|$|R

25|$|The light <b>diffracted</b> by a grating {{is found}} by summing the light <b>diffracted</b> {{from each of}} the elements, and is {{essentially}} a convolution of diffraction and interference patterns.|$|R
25|$|Diffraction grating {{effects are}} {{sometimes}} seen in meteorology. Diffraction coronas are colorful rings surrounding {{a source of}} light, such as the sun. These are usually observed {{much closer to the}} light source than halos, and are caused by very fine particles, like water droplets, ice crystals, or smoke particles in a hazy sky. When the particles are all nearly the same size they <b>diffract</b> the incoming light at very specific angles. The exact angle depends {{on the size of the}} particles. Diffraction coronas are commonly observed around light sources, like candle flames or street lights, in the fog. Cloud iridescence is caused by diffraction, occurring along coronal rings when the particles in the clouds are all uniform in size.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1951 Franklin finally arrived. Wilkins {{was away}} on holiday and missed an initial meeting at which Raymond Gosling stood in for him along with Alex Stokes, who, like Crick, would solve the basic {{mathematics}} that make possible a {{general theory of}} how helical structures <b>diffract</b> X-rays. No work had been done on DNA in the laboratory for several months; the new X-ray tube sat unused, waiting for Franklin. Franklin {{ended up with the}} DNA from Signer, Gosling became her PhD student, and she had the expectation that DNA X-ray diffraction work was her project. Wilkins returned to the laboratory expecting, on the other hand, that Franklin would be his collaborator and that they would work together on the DNA project that he had started.|$|E
500|$|Dark meat, which avian myologists {{refer to}} as [...] "red muscle", is used for {{sustained}} activity—chiefly walking, {{in the case of}} a chicken. The dark colour comes from the protein myoglobin, which plays a key role in oxygen uptake and storage within cells. White muscle, in contrast, is suitable only for short bursts of activity such as, for chickens, flying. Thus, the chicken's leg and thigh meat are dark, while its breast meat (which makes up the primary flight muscles) is white. Other birds with breast muscle more suitable for sustained flight, such as ducks and geese, have red muscle (and therefore dark meat) throughout. [...] Some cuts of meat including poultry expose the microscopic regular structure of intracellular muscle fibrils which can <b>diffract</b> light and produce iridescent colours, an optical phenomenon sometimes called structural colouration.|$|E
40|$|There is {{very good}} {{agreement}} between the observed decrease in amplitudes of longitudinal waves <b>diffracted</b> at the boundary of the earth's core and corresponding theoretical results. Especially, no rapid decrease of amplitudes {{at the beginning of}} the shadow zone is to be expected. Theory and observations show that the amplitudes of <b>diffracted</b> short-period P waves decrease faster with distance in the shadow zone than those of longer waves. At epicentral distances of over 110 ° short-period <b>diffracted</b> P waves emerge gradually and their beginning can rarely be ascertained. Corresponding long-period waves arrive within the limits of error at the time calculated on the assumption of a straight-line travel-time curve. Amplitudes of waves <b>diffracted</b> from a caustic decrease rapidly with distance; this usually limits the range of their observation to roughly 10 °. On the contrary, amplitudes of P waves <b>diffracted</b> at the core may be visible on records of a great earthquake at distances of 103 ° to 180 °. Observations for <b>diffracted</b> S waves cover a much smaller range of distances, since S waves appear in a portion of seismograms which is disturbed by earlier motion. Otherwise, observations indicate similar behavior for <b>diffracted</b> P and S waves...|$|R
