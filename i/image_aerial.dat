The subgraphs reflect both the geometric {{property and the}} color distribution of an <b>aerial</b> <b>image.</b> First, each <b>aerial</b> <b>image</b> is decomposed into a collection of regions {{in terms of their}} color intensities.

This paper addresses the application of non-parametric image registration techniques to precisely align images obtained from multimodal imaging, which is critical for the successful identification of individual trees using object recognition approaches. Non-parametric image registration, in particular the technique of optimizing one objective function containing data fidelity and regularization terms, provides flexible algorithms for image registration. Using a survey of woodlands in southern Spain as an example, we show that non-parametric image registration can be successful at fusing datasets when there is little prior knowledge about how the datasets are interrelated (i. e. {{in the absence of}} ground control points). The validity of non-parametric registration methods in airborne remote sensing is demonstrated by a series of experiments. Precise data fusion is a prerequisite to accurate recognition of objects within airborne imagery, so non-parametric image registration could make a valuable contribution to the analysis pipeline.

40|$|Recognizing <b>aerial</b> <b>image</b> {{categories}} {{is useful}} for scene annotation and surveillance. Local features have been demonstrated to be robust to image transformations, including occlusions and clutters. However, the geometric property of an <b>aerial</b> <b>image</b> (i. e., the topology and relative displacement of local features), which is key to discriminating <b>aerial</b> <b>image</b> categories, cannot be effectively represented by state-of-the-art generic visual descriptors. To solve this problem, we propose a recognition model that mines graphlets from <b>aerial</b> <b>images,</b> where graphlets are small connected subgraphs reflecting both the geometric property and color/texture distribution of an <b>aerial</b> <b>image.</b> More specifically, each <b>aerial</b> <b>image</b> is decomposed into a set of basic components (e. g., road and playground) and a region adjacency graph (RAG) is accordingly constructed to model their spatial interactions. <b>Aerial</b> <b>image</b> categories recognition can subsequently be casted as RAG-to-RAG matching. Based on graph theory, RAG-to-RAG matching is conducted by comparing all their respective graphlets. Because the number of graphlets is huge, we derive a manifold embedding algorithm to measure different-sized graphlets, after which we select graphlets that have highly discriminative and low redundancy topologies. Through quantizing the selected graphlets from each <b>aerial</b> <b>image</b> into a feature vector, we use support vector machine to discriminate <b>aerial</b> <b>image</b> categories. Experimental results indicate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art object/scene recognition models, and the visualized graphlets indicate that the discriminative patterns are discovered by our proposed approach...|$|R
40|$|Fast and {{accurately}} categorizing {{the millions of}} <b>aerial</b> <b>images</b> on Google Maps is a useful technique in pattern recognition. Existing methods cannot handle this task successfully due to two reasons: 1) the aerial images&# 39; topologies are the key feature to distinguish their categories, but they cannot be effectively encoded by a conventional visual codebook and 2) {{it is challenging to}} build a realtime image categorization system, as some geo-aware Apps update over 20 <b>aerial</b> <b>images</b> per second. To solve these problems, we propose an efficient <b>aerial</b> <b>image</b> categorization algorithm. It focuses on learning a discriminative topological codebook of <b>aerial</b> <b>images</b> under a multitask learning framework. The pipeline can be summarized as follows. We first construct a region adjacency graph (RAG) that describes the topology of each <b>aerial</b> <b>image.</b> Naturally, <b>aerial</b> <b>image</b> categorization can be formulated as RAG-to-RAG matching. According to graph theory, RAG-to-RAG matching is conducted by enumeratively comparing all their respective graphlets (i. e., small subgraphs). To alleviate the high time consumption, we propose to learn a codebook containing topologies jointly discriminative to multiple categories. The learned topological codebook guides the extraction of the discriminative graphlets. Finally, these graphlets are integrated into an AdaBoost model for predicting <b>aerial</b> <b>image</b> categories. Experimental results show that our approach is competitive to several existing recognition models. Furthermore, over 24 <b>aerial</b> <b>images</b> are processed per second, demonstrating that our approach is ready for real-world applications...|$|R

The application of ETM sensor Data Sat satellite image of 30 meter pixel resolutions {{has been used}} for land use and land cover classification of Tamakoshi River Basin (TRB) of Nepal. The paper tries to examine the strength of image classification methods in derivation of land use and land classification. Supervised digital image classification techniques was used for examination the thematic classification. Field verification, Google earth <b>image,</b> <b>aerial</b> photographs, topographical sheet and GPS locations were used for land use and land cover type classification, selecting training samples and assessing accuracy of classification results. Six major land use and land cover types: forest land, water bodies, bush/grass land, barren land, snow land and agricultural land was extracted using the method. Moreover, there is spatial variation of statistics of classified land uses and land cover types depending upon the classification methods. The image data revealed that the major portion of the surface area is covered by unclassified bush and grass land covering 34. 62 per cent followed by barren land(28 per cent). The knowledge derived from supervised classification was applied for the study. The result based on the field survey of the area during July 2014 also verifies the same result.

Interest in EUV, at-wavelength, aerial image measurement lead to the creation of several research tools worldwide. These tools are used in advanced mask development work, and in the evaluation of the need for commercial at-wavelength inspection tools. They describe performance measurements of two such tools, inspecting the same EUV mask in a series of benchmarking tests that includes brightfield and darkfield patterns. One tool is the SEMATECH Berkeley Actinic Inspection Tool (AIT) operating on a bending magnet beamline at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's Advanced Light Source. The AIT features an EUV Fresnel zoneplate microscope that emulates the numerical aperture of a 0. 25 -NA stepper, and projects the aerial image directly onto a CCD camera, with 700 x magnification. The second tool is an EUV microscope (EUVM) operating at the NewSUBARU synchrotron in Hyogo, Japan. The NewSUBARU tool projects the aerial image using a reflective, 30 x Schwarzschild objective lens, followed by a 10 - 200 x x-ray zooming tube. The illumination conditions and the imaging etendue are different for the two tools. The benchmarking measurements were used to determine many imaging and performance properties of the tools, including resolution, modulation transfer function (MTF), aberration magnitude, aberration field-dependence (including focal-plane tilt), illumination uniformity, line-edge roughness, and flare. These measurements reveal the current state of the art in at-wavelength inspection performance, and will be a useful reference as performance improves over time...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Kerkennah {{archipelago}} in Tunisia {{is vulnerable}} to sea erosion and different marks of coastline retreat indicate that this process is currently active. Our objective is to quantify coastal erosion and to discuss the management of risks along the coastline. For that purpose, we used both photointerpretation and field approaches, and integrated all the collected information into a GIS. The quantification of coastline evolution was done using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) module in the ArcGis 10 software. We focused on 2 dates for which comparable data with a spatial resolution of 2. 5 m were available: 1963 {{with the use of}} 33 aerial photographs and 2010 {{with the use of a}} SPOT 5 panchromatic <b>image.</b> <b>Aerial</b> photographs have been georeferenced on the SPOT 5 image, and the coastline has been determined for the two dates following the cliff tops or the limit of the vegetation when there was no cliff. The 6 studied areas correspond to the coasts where the error margin is of 6 meters (minimal error). The comparison of coastline between 1963 and 2010 shows that for a large majority of the studied areas, the coastline is either stable or retreating. The stable coasts concern 46. 9 % of the studied areas when eroded coasts concern 50. 4 %. Erosion reaches 42 m ± 6 m in the touristic area of SidiFrej (or 0, 9 m/yr in 47 yrs) and depends on different factors of vulnerability including lithology, sea level rise and anthropic activities. On the opposite, on some very limited areas, the coastline has advanced between the two dates (until 34 m ± 6 m) and those advancing patterns are strongly correlated to human infrastructures. The management of the coastline is of 3 types: (i) no intervention; (ii) intervention by the state or (iii) intervention by the local population, more specifically individual actions taken by residents of the coastline. In the areas where the coastline is free of human infrastructures, the coast is either eroded or stable, but never in progradation. In the area where the coastline is protected the evolution rates alternate between progradation, stability and erosion. The states infrastructures are localised in the different harbours, along the coast of Ramla (the biggest locality of Kerkennah) and along a part of the SidiFrej touristic area. They are continuous along the coasts and consist in majority of rockfill (along the coast or dikes) to protect the coasts from erosion, and in minority of embankments to raise the roads along the coasts or to gain land surface especially on the back of certain rockfill. These infrastructures are recent and often correlated with either a stagnation of the coastline or an artificial progradation of the land. They thus appear to be effective, although only at a very local scale. Besides, unprotected areas adjacent to rockfill infrastructures show signs of recent erosion, which might indicate the existence of negative side effects. The areas protected locally by individual actions are not continuous and constitute small fractions of the coastline. The rapid alternation between protected and unprotected areas show that for the moment and despite some efforts, there is no global and integrated management to counteract the erosion of the coast the small islands of the Kerkennah archipelago...|$|E

An <b>aerial</b> <b>image</b> is included into a multi-scale image block, in which relative orientations of terrestrial close range <b>images</b> and <b>aerial</b> <b>images</b> are then known from the bundle block adjustment.
