5|$|The Indian Princess {{certainly}} began a long American {{tradition of}} romanticizing and sexualizing Pocahontas, {{who was only}} a child in Smith’s original accounts. Therefore, <b>it</b> <b>deserves</b> recognition for inaugurating a genre, {{but it can be}} criticized for diminishing the potential richness of the subject matter.|$|E
5|$|Aware of the {{critical}} buzz surrounding the show, BBC1 Controller, Michael Grade, quickly announced that the series would be repeated on BBC1, stating, “I think it will reach a wider audience and <b>it</b> <b>deserves</b> it”, and so Edge of Darkness was duly shown, in double episodes, over three consecutive nights between 19 December and 21 December 1985, the fastest time between original broadcast and repeat in the BBC's history. These repeats were accompanied by a disclaimer that the GAIA organisation depicted in the programme was not connected with the Gaia publishing company supported by Prince Philip. It was a move that paid off – Edge of Darkness doubled its audience on BBC1 to 8 million viewers.|$|E
5|$|However, Davidson disobeys {{orders and}} {{continues}} to attack Athshean towns, refusing to return to Centralville. After a couple of weeks, the Athsheans attack Davidson's camp, killing or capturing everybody except Davidson and two others, who escape in a helicopter. Although the others {{want to return to}} Centralville, Davidson orders them back to fight the Athsheans. The Helicopter crashes, killing all but Davidson, who is captured. He is taken before Selver, who says that Davidson gave Selver the gift of murder, but that Selver would not kill Davidson, because there was no need. Instead, the Athsheans abandon Davidson on an island that Terran logging has rendered barren. Three years later the Terran ships return and take the surviving colonists off the planet; the commander of the ships states that the Terrans will not return except as observers and scientists, as the planet has been placed under a ban by the League of Worlds. Selver gives Lyubov's research, which he has saved, to one of the emissaries, who tells him that Lyubov's efforts to protect the Athsheans will not be forgotten, and that his work will be given the value <b>it</b> <b>deserves.</b> Selver reflects that although the planet may have been won from the Terrans, his people have now learned the ability to kill without reason.|$|E

25|$|A Pew Research poll {{conducted}} August 14–17 among 1,000 adults, found stark racial and political divisions in {{reactions to the}} shooting. By about four-to-one, African Americans (80% to 18%) said the shooting raised important issues about race, while whites, by 47% to 37%, said {{the issue of race}} is getting more attention than <b>it</b> <b>deserves.</b> The divide in public opinion was also observed across partisan lines, with 68% of Democrats (including 62% of white Democrats) believing the incident raises important issues about race that merit discussion, compared with 40% of Independents and 22% of Republicans. Republicans were also more likely than Democrats to view the police response as appropriate (43%), compared with 21% of Democrats; 65% of Republicans expressed confidence in the investigations into the incident, compared with 38% of Democrats.|$|E
500|$|Lapidge {{describes}} the {{repudiation of the}} hermeneutic style by modern scholars as disappointing. ″Invariably it is castigated as ′uncouth′ or ′barbarous′ and its practitioners are dismissed with contempt as the fellows of Dogberry.″ In his view: [...] "however unpalatable this style might be to modern taste, it was none the less a vital and pervasive aspect of late Anglo-Saxon culture, and <b>it</b> <b>deserves</b> closer and more sympathetic attention than it has previously received".|$|E

500|$|The Ecologist {{reviewed}} {{the book and}} described it as: [...] "well researched and painstakingly footnoted". The review concluded: Climate Change Denial is a wise and timely book.... <b>It</b> <b>deserves</b> an audience". Writing for ECOS magazine, Mary-Lou Considine wrote that the book [...] "dissects objections to the peer-reviewed science" [...] in [...] "forensic detail". Considine recommended the book {{for those who had}} previously visited the website Skeptical Science and subsequently wanted {{to learn more about the}} wider topic discussed on the site.|$|E
500|$|In France, a Wehrmacht {{propaganda}} company frequently accompanied Rommel on his inspection {{trips to}} document {{his work for}} both domestic and foreign audiences. In May 1944, the German newsreels reported on Rommel's speech at a Wehrmacht conference, where he stated his conviction that [...] "every single German soldier will make his contribution against the Anglo-American spirit that <b>it</b> <b>deserves</b> for its criminal and bestial air war campaign against our homeland." [...] The speech led to an upswing in morale and sustained confidence in Rommel.|$|E
500|$|Screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, who {{had worked}} on the two {{previous}} Transformers films, declined to return for the third film, with Kurtzman declaring that [...] "the franchise is so wonderful that <b>it</b> <b>deserves</b> to be fresh, all the time.

Kruger had frequent meetings with Industrial Light & Magic's (ILM) visual effects producers, who suggested plot points such as the scenes in Chernobyl.|$|E

500|$|During {{these last}} years at Idlewild, Willis {{continued}} contributing a weekly {{letter to the}} Home Journal. In 1850 he assisted Rufus Wilmot Griswold in preparing an anthology {{of the works of}} Poe, who had died mysteriously the year before. Griswold also wrote the first biography of Poe in which he purposely set out to ruin the dead author's reputation. Willis {{was one of the most}} vocal of Poe's defenders, writing at one point: [...] "The indictment (for <b>it</b> <b>deserves</b> no other name) is not true. It is full of cruel misrepresentations. It deepens the shadows unto unnatural darkness, and shuts out the rays of sunshines that ought to relieve them".|$|E
500|$|Christina Patterson called Waters [...] "an {{extremely}} confident writer, combining precise, sensuous descriptions with {{irony and}} wit in a skilled, multi-layered pastiche of the lesbian historical romance." [...] Renee Graham's review in The Boston Globe characterised the novel's style as [...] "plush and inviting—delicious, even". In The New York Times, Miranda Seymour {{drew attention to}} the scene when Nan dresses up as Hadrian's lover, the page Antinous who was drowned in the Nile, for a masquerade benefiting Diana's friends in a hedonistic bacchanalia that ends violently with Nan cast out of the house into the cold, highlighting it as a passage of [...] "startling power". Although Seymour was disappointed with the ending, she wrote, [...] "If lesbian fiction is to reach a wider readership—as much, though far from all, of <b>it</b> <b>deserves</b> to do—Waters is just the person to carry the banner." ...|$|E
500|$|Ebert, {{writing for}} the Chicago Sun-Times, gave the film {{three and a half}} stars out of four, writing that [...] "Angel Heart is a thriller and a horror movie, but most of all it's an exuberant {{exercise}} in style, in which Parker and his actors have fun taking it to the limit". Ian Nathan of Empire called the film [...] "A diabolical treat with Rourke and De Niro in top form." [...] Almar Haflidason of the BBC wrote, [...] "The movie maintains intrigue at every turn and Rourke is spellbinding. Robert De Niro, Charlotte Rampling, and the assembled cast are all excellent. But this is Mickey Rourke's movie, and he puts in a mesmerising performance." [...] Richard Luck, writing for Film4, concluded in his review, [...] "The book's so good <b>it</b> <b>deserves</b> a better movie, but Rourke's performance is such that Angel Heart stands out from the necromancy movie crowd." ...|$|E

500|$|Metro complimented the visuals of the remaster, {{saying that}} [...] "The game still doesn't look {{quite as good}} as the last couple of Call Of Duty's, but it's {{extremely}} close. And whatever else you say about it, on a presentational level this is an excellent remaster." [...] The multiplayer they praised for being more pleasingly simple than recent Call of Duty games and pointed out how it was sure to bring considerable nostalgia to players of the original, but nonetheless criticized it for feeling limited and shallow. They also noted that the remaster inadvertently felt clichéd and overfamiliar, due to the original having inspired numerous sequels and imitations, but praised the modern-day setting as feeling surprisingly fresh again. Metro summarized their review by saying [...] "One of the most influential video games of all time gets the remaster <b>it</b> <b>deserves,</b> and is still impressively entertaining after all these years." ...|$|E
500|$|Noting the {{large-scale}} Mexican {{immigration to the}} Southwestern United States, Kennan said in 2002 there were [...] "unmistakable evidences of a growing differentiation between the cultures, respectively, of large southern and southwestern regions of this country, on the one hand", and those of [...] "some northern regions". In the former, [...] "the very culture of {{the bulk of the}} population of these regions will tend to be primarily Latin-American in nature rather than what is inherited from earlier American traditions... Could it really be that there was so little of merit [...] that <b>it</b> <b>deserves</b> to be recklessly trashed in favor of a polyglot mix-mash?" [...] Mayers argues that Kennan throughout his career represented the [...] "tradition of militant nativism" [...] that resembled or even exceeded the Know Nothings of the 1850s. Mayers adds that Kennan also believed American women had too much power.|$|E
500|$|The Beauty Process {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Rolling Stone editor Alec Foege {{felt that the}} album is both more powerful and crisper than its predecessors, stating that the band had [...] "matured into punk's distaff Jagger and Richards." [...] Although he considered the song [...] "Lorenza, Giada, Alessandra" [...] to be a rip-off of Sonic Youth's [...] "Swimsuit Issue", he concluded that the band offers [...] "more fresh stylistic variations on classic punk into 40 minutes than most bands come up with during a career. Clever, cocky and ultimately ageless, The Beauty Process gives punk the face lift <b>it</b> <b>deserves</b> without smoothing the wrinkles." [...] Similarly, Heidi Macdonald of CMJ New Music Monthly praised the album's different moods and attitude-filled lyrics, commenting that The Beauty Process includes [...] "just enough self-examination {{to show that the}} girls have grown up, bet they haven't gotten stale." ...|$|E
50|$|Ibne Safi {{wrote the}} story and {{screenplay}} for a film 'Dhamaka' based on his novel 'Bebakon ki talash'. The film {{did not get the}} publicity and fame which <b>it</b> <b>deserved,</b> and remains mostly forgotten.|$|R

500|$|The {{game has}} been called a flawed {{masterpiece}} by critics. The scale and variety of choice and effect was highlighted by reviewers as Bloodlines greatest success, including the variety of clans, with specific dialog options, and the specific reactions from other characters, each with their own clan loyalty and bias. GameSpy called it a nearly flawless classic role-playing game; The New York Times described it as brilliant but unfinished. Eurogamer praised its [...] "effortlessly intelligent" [...] script, saying that [...] "no other game has come close. Nothing's even tried". VideoGamer.com opined that at its best, Bloodlines stands among the greatest RPGs of the preceding five years, although its technical problems should be remembered. According to HonestGamers, the game [...] "may not be polished and may end with a sigh instead of a shout, but for its ambition alone <b>it</b> <b>deserves</b> stream after stream of compliments." [...] Reviewers compared it to other successful role-playing games, including Fallout, , , , , and Deus Ex; Eurogamer described Bloodlines as Deus Ex with vampires.|$|E
500|$|Rand's first bestseller, The Fountainhead, {{received}} {{far fewer}} reviews than We the Living, and reviewers' opinions were mixed. There {{was a positive}} review in The New York Times that Rand greatly appreciated. The reviewer called Rand [...] "a writer of great power" [...] who wrote [...] "brilliantly, beautifully and bitterly", and stated that [...] "you {{will not be able}} to read this masterful book without thinking through some of the basic concepts of our time". There were other positive reviews, but Rand dismissed most of them as either not understanding her message or as being from unimportant publications. Some negative reviews focused on the length of the novel, such as one that called it [...] "a whale of a book" [...] and another that said [...] "anyone who is taken in by <b>it</b> <b>deserves</b> a stern lecture on paper-rationing". Other negative reviews called the characters unsympathetic and Rand's style [...] "offensively pedestrian".|$|E
500|$|Zack Handlen {{gave the}} episode a [...] "B–" [...] and wrote that [...] "works {{far better than}} <b>it</b> <b>deserves</b> to", due largely to the {{performance}} of Hawkes and the [...] "bat shit weirdness" [...] of the plot. He was particularly critical of the [...] "self-serious" [...] and [...] "pompous" [...] tone of the episode. Handlen concluded that the episode was [...] "like watching someone's fan fiction getting brought to life". He did, however, write that [...] "there is something strangely fascinating about" [...] the premise; in particular, he was pleased with the conclusion, calling it the moment when [...] "things pick up". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris, despite noting the potential in the episode's theme of the relationship between writer and their characters, felt that [...] "Milagro" [...] betrayed Scully's personality and featured her doing things that were out of character.|$|E
