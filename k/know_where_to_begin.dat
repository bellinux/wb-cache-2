Seriously, the Season 6 finale left us laying awake afterward thinking about everything, a feeling we haven't had from Grey's in years and rarely achieved by any program." [...] John Kubicek of BuddyTV also noted that the finale was the best episode, adding: [...] " [...] two of the best hours of television all year. It was certainly the best Grey's Anatomy has ever been, which is saying a lot since I'd written the show off for the past few years. No show does a big traumatic event like Grey's Anatomy, and the shooter gave the show license for heightened drama with five major characters being shot over the two hours. It was emotional, expertly paced and had me in tears for most of the finale." [...] Entertainment Weekly wrote, [...] "At any rate, now you can at least see where it all began. And while you’re still pondering how Grey's can still be so damn good sometimes," ...|$|E

Mary Erskine told her that she had postponed giving her final answer about buying the house, in order first to see Mr. Gordon, to know whether he had any objection to the change of ownership.

5000|$|On the {{accession}} of Anne and {{the appointment}} of Prince George as Lord High Admiral, Churchill {{was appointed to the}} council of his Royal Highness (23 May 1702). His interest sufficed to make him chief, and his first step was to promote himself at a bound to be Admiral of the Blue, thus placing himself above Aylmer, who was then Vice-Admiral of the Red. At the same time, to give the promotion an air of reality, as well as, perhaps, to ensure the pay of the rank, he hoisted his flag for a few days at Portsmouth, on board HMS Triumph. This and a similar parade the following year were his whole service as a flag officer; but the star of the house of Churchill was just then in the ascendant, and for the next six years Churchill governed the navy, as his brother, the Duke of Marlborough, governed the army. Complaints of the mismanagement of the navy were loud and frequent. The trade, it was alleged, was inefficiently protected; even the convoys were insecure. The activity of the French privateers was notorious; and the English Admiralty, with a force at their disposal immeasurably superior to that of France, so managed it that at the point of attack they were always inferior. The exploits of Duguay-Trouin, or Forbin, in the Channel brought this home to the popular mind, and permitted Lord Haversham to say in the House of Lords: [...] Your disasters at sea have been so many, a man scarce <b>knows</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin.</b> Your ships have been taken by your enemies, as the Dutch take your herrings, by shoals, upon your own coasts; nay, your royal navy itself has not escaped.

"[6] Since then I think I have found him and {{discovered}} in the process that he was far more lost than anyone suspected. In my recent biography of Gould I have tried to show in detail {{that much of what}} has been said about his life and career is inaccurate and misleading [...] not merely open to debate over interpretation but simply wrong. The generalizations made, assumptions held, anecdotes cited, charges levied, and information presented about Gould are so riddled with error that the serious biographer hardly <b>knows</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> the task of correction. Long before his death in 1892, Gould passed into the realm of myth, a legendary figure created in large part by the New York newspapers that so despised him. From their pages emerged the image of Gould as the supreme villain of his age, the most hated man in America. Most of what has been written about Gould since that time has been drawn from these same papers, sometimes knowingly and sometimes not. The Adams brothers also helped forge the Gould legend, and no one did more to perpetuate it than Matthew Josephson, who seemed to have an infinite gift for error, large and small. If there was a historian in the Josephson household, her name was Hannah. Only one scholar, Julius Grodinsky, has even attempted a serious study of Gould's business career, and his book was promptly labeled an apologia by many critics [4]. Historians no less than the general public have been reluctant to let go of Gould's image as arch villain, let alone concede Grodinsky's argument that, like him or not, Gould was a business genius who exerted a profound influence on railroad development in the nineteenth century. No business historian took this notion seriously until Alfred D. Chandler, Jr., embraced it in his magisterial study, The Visible Hand [I]...|$|R

[...] "Climbing" [...] has a rugged beat and a lyrical allusion to The Notorious B.I.G.'s 1993 song [...] "Party and Bullshit". The middle section of the album explores broader emotions and themes of loss and lament. [...] "Slipping Away" [...] is a slow-building meditation on loss, with sentimental music backing the narrator's plea to a departing love. On the slow burning pop rock song [...] "Lost for Now", he comes to terms with being alone and leaves town, but finds salvation in [...] "a smile that changes everything" [...] as the song closes with a shimmer of cymbal. The stark ballad [...] "Butterfly" [...] is built around Bilal's soaring falsetto and Glasper's rippling piano. Its music explores jazz, and also features dreamy Moog accents.
