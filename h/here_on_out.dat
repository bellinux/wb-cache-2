[...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly called [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] "one {{of those}} deliciously dense episodes {{in which the}} nourishment of revelation is mixed with huge chunks of sugary intrigue" [...] and speculated that the scene in which Alex is executed will be [...] "sitting very high on this ranking of all-time pivotal Lost moments" [...] by the series' May 2010 end. [...] Before the season finale aired, Jensen ranked this as the second best moment {{of the season and}} put the scene in which the monster attacks the mercenaries in ninth place. [...] Dan Kois and Lane Brown of New York magazine thought that this [...] "episode didn't exactly feel like the usual moderately paced, secret-revealing drama Lost usually is; it felt like an action movie... it was like watching Die Hard on an island". [...] Chris Carabott of IGN gave the episode a 9.3/10, concluding that [...] "if 'The Shape of Things to Come' is any indication of the level of quality that [...] should expect from <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>out</b> then we are in for some incredible storytelling" [...] and [...] "Alex's death will probably be remembered as one of the more pivotal scenes in the entire series [...] it is such a phenomenally shot, edited and acted moment... it would be incredibly hard not to feel for [...] here."

[...] Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad summed up [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] as [...] "a brilliant episode... tons of action, several big revelations, and more questions to ponder". [...] Don Williams of BuddyTV decided that the episode was [...] "worth waiting five weeks for" [...] and [...] "so jam packed that I need to give my brain time to rest". [...] Williams's colleague Oscar Dahl ranked the scene in which Alex is killed as the fifth best moment of the season, noting that [...] "it was perfectly paced... and provided a huge shock... and some of the best acting you'll ever see". [...] Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post wrote that [...] "'The Shape of Things to Come' was the perfect episode to get everyone back into the swing of Lost. [...] It wasn't a [...] à la 'The Constant'. [...] It was an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride, which to me matched the 'Pilot' bombastic grandeur".|$|E

The method allows for quantification {{of the total}} number of nitrogen dioxide molecules in the troposphere and is hence a useful tool for measuring the burden of this key trace gas. In particular, we focus <b>here</b> <b>on</b> observations carried <b>out</b> in and around Houston, including focused flights to measure the fluxes of nitrogen dioxide emitted from power plants. This remote sensing technique can be used to infer fluxes irrespective of the aircraft altitude, and the height or uniformity of the boundary layer.

40|$|AbstractThe {{issue of}} how human {{immunodeficiency}} virus- 1 (HIV- 1) enters the body following sexual contact {{has been the subject}} of considerable controversy. Several possible routes for the initial infection have been suggested [1 – 6], including the possibility that the transmission is mediated by HIV- 1 -infected lymphocytes or macrophages in serum and female genital tract secretions, rather than by free virus. We recently reported that HIV- 1 -infected, activated primary monocytes can migrate between epithelial cells grown in confluent monolayer cultures in vitro[7]. We report <b>here</b> <b>on</b> experiments carried <b>out</b> in mice to test the hypothesis that mononuclear blood cells are capable of migrating through intact epithelia, and thus of carrying a virus into an animal. We placed double-stained, activated mononuclear blood cells into the vaginas of mice; four hours later, numerous double-stained cells were observed in the connective tissue beneath the vaginal epithelium and the iliac lymph nodes of the experimental mice. We speculate that such migration may be involved in the sexual transmission of HIV- 1...|$|R

40|$|Reducing heating {{costs is}} an {{important}} concern for householders, but many conventional methods of cutting down heating costs, such as insulating lofts and cavity walls and fitting double glazing, involve considerable capital outlay. An effective way of reducing heat losses {{with a minimum of}} capital outlay is to fit reflecting metal foil behind the central heating radiators, but little has been done to measure the amount of energy saved in this way.

Work is reported <b>here</b> <b>on</b> experiments carried <b>out</b> in an environmental chamber to measure the effect on heat losses of metal foils behind radiators and beneath suspended floors. Reductions in the overall energy consumption of the room of up to 6 % were recorded by installing foil behind a radiator, while the heat loss through the area of wall immediately behind the radiator fell to less than 30 % of the original value. The heat loss from a suspended timber floor was reduced by up to 48 % when foil was applied to its under surface. ...|$|R
