40|$|There is {{widespread}} {{interest in the}} development of a meas-ure of hospital output. This paper describes the problem of measuring the expected cost of the mix of inpatient cases treated in a hospital (<b>hospital</b> <b>case-mix)</b> and a general ap-proach to its solution. The solution is based on a set of ho-mogenous groups of patients, defined by a patient classifica-tion system, and a set of estimated relative cost weights cor-responding to the patient categories. This approach is applied to develop a summary measure of the expected relative costli-ness of the mix of Medicare patients treated in 5, 576 partici-pating hospitals. The Medicare case-mix index is evaluated by estimating a hospital average cost function. This provides a direct test of the hypothesis that the relationship between Medicare case-mix and Medicare cost per case is proportional. The cost function analysis also provides a means of simulating the ef-fects of classification error on our estimate of this relation-ship. Our results indicate that thIs general approach to meas-uring <b>hospital</b> <b>case-mix</b> provides a valid and robust measure of the expected cost of a hospital's case-mix...|$|E

We adopt a distance function approach, while measuring the technical efficiency level with stochastic frontier techniques. After controlling for environmental variables and <b>hospital</b> <b>case-mix,</b> inefficiency is negatively associated with specialization and positively associated with capitalization. Capitalization is typical of private structures which, on average, use resources less efficiently with respect to public and not-for-profit hospitals.

40|$|Background: The {{hospital}} standardized mortality ratio (HSMR) {{is developed}} {{to evaluate and}} improve hospital quality. Different methods {{can be used to}} standardize the hospital mortality ratio. Our aim was to assess the validity and applicability of directly and indirectly standardized hospital mortality ratios. Methods: Retrospective scenario analysis using routinely collected hospital data to compare deaths predicted by the indirectly standardized case-mix adjustment method with observed deaths. Discharges from Dutch hospitals in the period 2003 – 2009 were used to estimate the underlying prediction models. We analysed variation in indirectly standardized hospital mortality ratios (HSMRs) when changing the case-mix distributions using different scenarios. Sixty-one Dutch hospitals were included in our scenario analysis. Results: A numerical example showed that when interaction between <b>hospital</b> and <b>case-mix</b> is present and <b>case-mix</b> differs between <b>hospitals,</b> indirectly standardized HSMRs vary between hospitals providing the same quality of care. In empirical data analysis, the differences between directly and indirectly standardized HSMRs for individual hospitals were limited. Conclusion: Direct standardization is not affected by the presence of interaction between <b>hospital</b> and <b>case-mix</b> and is therefore theoretically preferable over indirect standardization. Since direct standardization is practically impossible when multiple predictors are included in the case-mix adjustment model, indirect standardization is the only available method t...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To report {{complication}} incidence {{to identify}} outliers more reliably, to provide feedback on performance, and {{to generate more}} timely alerts. Design: Data from a retrospective entire-population study {{was used as an}} example for the charting methods. Participants: The Western Australian (WA) Data Linkage System identified all cataract or lens-related procedures undertaken in WA and those operations complicated with endophthalmitis over 20 years from 1980. Methods: Use of risk-adjusted charts to assess complication incidence between hospitals. We compare these with ones that demonstrate individual hospital performance. The latter also adjust for risk and enable reporting at the time of complication rather than after a data collection period. Main Outcome Measure: Excessive complication risk (postoperative endophthalmitis). Results: Confidence limits allow comparison of hospitals performing different numbers of operations; the 95 % Poisson prediction interval was exceeded by 4 possible-outlier <b>hospitals.</b> <b>Case-mix</b> risk adjustment better narrowed them to probable outliers (now only 2 hospitals). However, 2 high-volume nonoutlier hospitals had a short duration of significantly higher risk of endophthalmitis with cumulative sum analysis. Their endophthalmitis numbers were not excessive, and they were not identified as outliers by the other methods. Conclusion: Simple ranking (or league) tables are not useful enough; someone is always first and last. Chance and circumstance will push all towards the middle with time. Risk-adjusted observed versus expected charting better identifies outliers than a funnel plot. Better still, the use of cumulative sum analysis can help surgeons distinguish between failures due to random processes and those that are associated with problems that require investigation to search for potentially correctable causes...|$|R

40|$|Evaluation of Health Care {{activities}} in Pediatric Cardiology and Cardiosurgery Departments - The evaluation of Health Care activities, particulalarly of those concerning hospitals, {{is one of}} the most important tools of the National Health Service to obtain a "Fair" resource allocation. In the recent past, a great bulk of research has been focused on methods for patient classificatione according to resource needs. Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) {{is one of the}} most important patient classification system related to resource allocation which has been developed in the U. S. Medicare Program (HCFA-DRGs) in the eighties and more recently adopted all over Europe. Italy included. The DRG system has proved to be valid but has also showed its limits, mostly concerning applicability outside U. S., identification of specific patient subgroups (like the pediatric patient population) and capability to distinguish between patients whit apparently similar resource needs, but different clinical severity conditions. In order to overcome such limits, DRGs Have been resource needs, but different clinical severity conditions. In order to overcome such limits, DRGS have been subjected to some important modifications. All patient DRG (AP-DRG) is a system payng more attention to some patient subgroups, such as pediatric one. Research is still looking for methods - easily extensible to the wohole hospital informative system- for distinguishing between patients whose conditions present diferent degrees of severity.

40|$|Abstract Background The medical {{performance}} evaluation, {{which provides}} a basis for rational decision-making, {{is an important part}} of medical service research. Current progress with health services reform in China is far from satisfactory, without sufficient regulation. To achieve better progress, an effective tool for evaluating medical performance needs to be established. In view of this, this study attempted to develop such a tool appropriate for the Chinese context. Methods Data was collected from the front pages of medical records (FPMR) of all large general public hospitals (21 hospitals) in the third and fourth quarter of 2007. Locally developed Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs) were introduced as a tool for risk adjustment and performance evaluation indicators were established: Charge Efficiency Index (CEI), Time Efficiency Index (TEI) and inpatient mortality of low-risk group cases (IMLRG), to reflect respectively work efficiency and medical service quality. Using these indicators, the inpatient services' performance was horizontally compared among <b>hospitals.</b> <b>Case-mix</b> Index (CMI) was used to adjust efficiency indices and then produce adjusted CEI (aCEI) and adjusted TEI (aTEI). Poisson distribution analysis was used to test the statistical significance of the IMLRG differences between different hospitals. Results Using the aCEI, aTEI and IMLRG scores for the 21 hospitals, Hospital A and C had relatively good overall performance because their medical charges were lower, LOS shorter and IMLRG smaller. The performance of Hospital P and Q was the worst due to their relatively high charge level, long LOS and high IMLRG. Various performance problems also existed in the other hospitals. Conclusion It is possible to develop an accurate and easy to run performance evaluation system using Case-Mix as the tool for risk adjustment, choosing indicators close to consumers and managers, and utilizing routine report forms as the basic information source. To keep such a system running effectively, it is necessary to improve the reliability of clinical information and the risk-adjustment ability of Case-Mix. </p...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{sought to}} develop a {{methodology}} for estimating potential solid organ donors and measuring donation performance in a geographic region based on readily available data on the hospitals in that region. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed in a stratified random sample of 89 hospitals from 3 regions to attain a baseline of donor potential. Data {{on a range of}} hospital characteristics were collected and tested as predictors of donor potential through the use of hierarchical Poisson regression modeling. RESULTS: Five hospital characteristics predicted donor potential: hospital deaths, <b>hospital</b> Medicare <b>case-mix</b> index, total <b>hospital</b> staffed beds, medical school affiliation, and trauma center certification. Regional estimates were attained by aggregating individual hospital estimates. Confidence intervals for these regional estimates indicated that actual donations represented from 28 % to 44 % of the potential in the regions studied. CONCLUSIONS: This methodology accurately estimates organ donor potential within 3 geographic regions and lays the foundation for evaluating organ donation effectiveness nationwide. Additional research is needed to test the validity of the model in other geographic regions and to further explore organ donor potential in hospitals with fewer than 50 beds...|$|R
40|$|At present Germany {{experiences}} a shake-up {{of the hospital}} indus-try, following {{the introduction of a}} DRG-based hospital budgeting sys-tem. Hospital owners re-evaluate their assets and adapt their strate-gies to the new regulatory environment. Benchmarking studies {{play a vital role in}} assessing own hospitals as well as potential cooperation partners or acquisition targets. Key indicators in such studies are hos-pital baserates, which re°ect case-mix adjusted costs per case in the respective <b>hospitals.</b> The <b>case-mix</b> adjustment is based on published DRG weights which determine the pay-per-case. Setting these weights is a di±cult and lengthy political process and weights are likely to be volatile during the early phase of the new budgeting system, when the majority of strategic activity occurs. The derived baserates are therefore only snapshots and provide limited information about fu-ture pro¯tability of hospitals. To rectify this shortcoming, we suggest a robust benchmarking methodology which recognises weight volatil-ity explicitly. We apply the methodology to two groups of hospitals in Germany, a homogeneous nation-wide group of 18 maximal care units and a more heterogeneous group of all hospitals in a federal state.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{questions of}} how to incorporate quality of care, represented by disutility-bearing effects such as mortality, morbidity and re-admission, in measuring relative performance of public <b>hospitals.</b> Currently, <b>case-mix</b> funding and performance, measured with costs per case-mix adjusted separation, hold hospitals accountable for costs, but not effects, of care, creating economic incentives for quality of care minimising cost per admission. To allow an appropriate trade-off between the value and cost of quality of care a correspondence is demonstrated between maximising net benefit and minimising costs plus decision makers’ value of disutility events, where effects of care can be represented by disutility events and hospitals face a common comparator. Applying this correspondence to performance measurement, frontier methods specifying disutility events as inputs are illustrated to have distinct advantages over output specifications, allowing estimation of: 1. economic efficiency conditional {{on the value of}} avoiding disutility events. 2. technical, scale and congestion sources of net benefit efficiency; 3. best practice peers over potential decision makers’ value of quality; and 4. industry shadow price of avoiding disutility events. The accountability this performance measurement framework provides for effects and cost of quality of care are also illustrated as the basis for moving from case-mix funding towards a funding mechanism based on maximising net benefit. Links to evidence-based medicine in health technology assessment are emphasised in illustrating application of the correspondence to comparison of multiple strategies in the cost-disutility plane, where radial properties as shown to provide distinct advantages over comparison in the cost-effectiveness plane. The identified performance measurement and funding framework allows policy makers to create economic incentives consistent with evidence-based medicine in practice, while avoiding incentives for cream-skimming and cost-shifting. The linear nature of the net benefit correspondence theorem allows simple inclusion of multiple effects of quality, whether expressed as not meeting a standard, functional limitation or disutility directly. In applying the net benefit correspondence theorem to hospitals a clinical activity level is suggested, to allow correspondence conditions to be robustly satisfied in identification of effects with decision analytic methods, adjustment for within DRG risk factors and data linkage to effects beyond separation...|$|R

METHODS: CW scales were elaborated according to various methodologies in order to isolate the scale allowing the most adequate financing system, i. e. approaching the real costs as much as possible. Twelve scales were created. They vary according to the type of data used, according to DRGs and severities of illness included within the scale, and according to the variable used in order to isolate outliers. RESULTS: For a similar <b>case-mix,</b> <b>Hospitals</b> H 2 and H 5 would see their financing increased through a prospective system based on the selected CW scale (No. 6). This modification would generate a reduction in financing going from - 1 to - 9 % according to hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: The cost database created made it possible to create a CW scale according to a technique which could constitute the first step of a PPS if advantages of a such financing system were established. In the Belgian context, it would be probably judicious to envisage regional databases allowing diversified methodological approaches whose results would be confronted, discussed, and coordinated at the federal level.

40|$|Abstract Background Patient Safety Indicators (PSI) {{are being}} {{modestly}} used in Spain, somewhat due to concerns on their empirical properties. This paper provides evidence by answering three questions: a) Are PSI differences across hospitals systematic -rather than random?; b) Do PSI measure differences among hospital-providers -as opposed to differences among patients?; and, c) Are measurements {{able to detect}} hospitals with a higher than "expected" number of cases? Methods An empirical validation study on administrative data was carried out. All 2005 and 2006 publicly-funded hospital discharges were used to retrieve eligible cases of five PSI: Death in low-mortality DRGs (MLM); decubitus ulcer (DU); postoperative pulmonary embolism or deep-vein thrombosis (PE-DVT); catheter-related infections (CRI), and postoperative sepsis (PS). Empirical Bayes statistic (EB) was used to estimate whether the variation was systematic; logistic-multilevel modelling determined what proportion of the variation was explained by the hospital; and, shrunken residuals, as provided by multilevel modelling, were plotted to flag hospitals performing worse than expected. Results Variation across hospitals was observed to be systematic in all indicators, with EB values ranging from 0. 19 (CI 95 %: 0. 12 to 0. 28) in PE-DVT to 0. 34 (CI 95 %: 0. 25 to 0. 45) in DU. A {{significant proportion of the}} variance was explained by the <b>hospital,</b> once patient <b>case-mix</b> was adjusted: from a 6 % in MLM (CI 95 %: 3 % to 11 %) to a 24 % (CI 95 %: 20 % to 30 %) in CRI. All PSI were able to flag hospitals with rates over the expected, although this capacity decreased when the largest hospitals were analysed.

Methods: We assessed patient experiences with care and HRQOL using interviews with 1, 207 hospitalized, general medicine patients participating in a multi-disciplinary provider team intervention at a large academic medical center Patient outcome variables included the Picker dimensions of hospital care (Continuity and Transition, Coordination of Care, Emotional Support, Information and Education, Involvement of Family and Friends, Physical Comfort, Respect for Patient Preferences, Overall Impression), the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI- 3), and the SF- 12 physical (PCS- 12) and mental health (MCS- 12) summary scores. Results: Patients randomized to a multidisciplinary intervention reported higher emotional support (b = 3. 32), t(903) = 2. 01, p =. 044, and physical comfort (b = 3. 49), t(863) = 2. 25, p =. 025,from health care providers than did the control group, but these effects became nonsignificant after adjusting for multiple comparisons. The HUI- 3, PCS- 12, and MCS- 12 summary scores improved significantly from baseline to the 30 -day, ts(943, 919, 860) = 4. 94, 2. 20, and 5. 31, ps <. 0001, =. 03, and <. 0001, respectively, and the 4 -month follow-ups, ts(871, 919, 943) = 7. 25, 8. 68, and 8. 08, ps <. 001, <. 001, and <. 0001, respectively, but change on these measures did not differ berween intervention and control patients.

Hence, the behavioral changes in hospital staff in the intervention group had no effect on patient-reported outcomes. Mental health at baseline was predictive of patient evaluations of the hospitalization, but evaluations of care were not associated with subsequent HRQOL.

We develop this methodology for the Spanish case. In a follow-up paper we will present results using Spanish data. In Spain graduates choose hospital training vacancies in a sequential manner that depends on their average grade. Our framework relies on three assumptions. First, high quality hospitals provide high quality training. Second, graduates are well informed decision makers who are well qualified to assess hospital quality. Third, they prefer to choose a high quality vacancy rather than a low quality one ceteris paribus. If these assumptions hold, then the first physicians to choose are likely to grab the best vacancies while the ones who choose last are stuck with the worst available. Thus, it is possible to infer from physicans’ choices quality differentials amongst hospitals. We model the physician’s decision as a nested-logit a la McFadden. Unlike in standard applications of McFadden’s model, in our application the choice set is not constant across physicians but it shrinks along the sequential hospital choice process...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Hospital Acquired Infections (HAIs) are {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most serious patient safety issues in healthcare today. It has been shown that HAIs contribute significantly not only to morbidity and mortality, but also to excessive costs for the health care system and for hospitalized patients. Since possibilities of prevention and control exist, hospital quality can be improved while simultaneously the cost of care is reduced. The objectives of this study were to examine the prevalence and the excess costs associated with HAIs. Methods: A retrospective observational study was performed to estimate costs associated with hospital-acquired infections in Belgian hospitals, both in procedural admissions and in medical admissions. Hospital, diagnosis-related group, age and gender were used as matching factors to compare stays associated with HAIs and stays without HAIs. Data were obtained from the Minimum Basic Data Set 2008 used by Belgian <b>hospitals</b> to register <b>case-mix</b> data for each admission to obtain reimbursement from the authorities. Data included information from 45 hospitals representing 16, 141 beds and 2, 467, 698 patient stays. Using the 2008 national feedback programme of the Belgian government, cost data were collected (prolonged length of stay, additional pharmaceuticals and procedures) and subsequently linked to the data set. By means of a sensitivity analysis we estimated potential monetary savings when a reduction in the incidence of HAIs in hospitals having a higher rate of hospital-acquired infections in comparison to other hospitals would be realized. Results: In our sample 5. 9 % of the hospital stays were associated with a hospital-acquired infection. In the procedural admission subset this was the case for 4. 7 % of the hospital stays. The additional mean cost of the hospital-acquired infection was (sic) 2, 576 for all stays (P < 0. 001) and (sic) 3, 776 for procedural stays (P < 0. 001). The total burden of disease in Belgium is estimated at (sic) 533, 076, 110 for all admissions and (sic) 235, 667, 880 for the subset of procedural admissions. The excess length of stay varied between hospitals from 2. 52 up to 8. 06 days (Md 4. 58, SD 1. 01), representing an associated cost of (sic) 355, 060, 174 (66, 61 % of the total cost). The cost of additional medical procedures and additional pharmaceutical products was estimated at (sic) 62, 864, 544 (11. 97 %) and (sic) 115, 151, 939 (21. 60 %) respectively. Overall, our results showed that considerable variability between hospitals regarding the incidence of HAIs (3. 77 - 9. 78 %) for all hospital stays is present, indicating a potential for improvement. We provide a full overview of the potential monetary savings when reductions in HAIs are realized by applying different thresholds. For instance, if all Belgian hospitals having a higher rate of hospital-acquired infections improve their rate to the level of the hospital corresponding to percentile 75 (= 7. 5 % HAI) savings would be (sic) 17, 799, 326. Conclusion: HAIs are associated with important additional healthcare costs. Although not all hospital-acquired infections can be prevented, an opportunity to increase cost-effectiveness of hospital care delivery presents itself. This study is the first to estimate the annual economic burden of HAIs for Belgium at a national level, incorporating all associated hospital costs. Apart from the fact that the cost of prolonged length of stay is of major importance, we have also shown that the cost of additional procedures and pharmaceutical products cannot be neglected when estimating the financial burden of HAIs...|$|R
