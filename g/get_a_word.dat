25|$|It once {{happened}} in that country (and this seems indeed strange) that a living creature {{was caught in the}} forest as to which no one could say definitely whether it was a man or some other animal; for no one could <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> from it or be sure that it understood human speech. It had the human shape, however, in every detail, both as to hands and face and feet; but the entire body was covered with hair as the beasts are, and down the back it had a long coarse mane like that of a horse, which fell to both sides and trailed along the ground when the creature stooped in walking.|$|E
500|$|Tijori {{received}} his college education from Narsee Monjee College {{in his hometown}} Mumbai. While in college, Tijori joined an amateur theatre group. Aamir Khan, Ashutosh Gowariker, Paresh Rawal and Vipul Shah were also {{the members of the}} same group. His friends influenced him to pursue a career in film acting, in which during his early career he struggled. He {{said in an interview with}} Rediff.com [...] "For three years, I sat outside offices trying to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> with producers [...] I managed to do some tiny roles, which were very pathetic." [...] He had worked for Cine Blitz magazine and also as a hotel manager.|$|E
500|$|Johnson's {{performance}} {{has also been}} praised. In 2004, ESPN released {{a list of the}} top 100 Simpsons sport moments, ranking his appearance at number 27. Sports Illustrated listed Johnson's cameo as the fifth best athlete guest appearance on The Simpsons. Meyers wrote that the episode [...] "makes a lot of good points about the public making heroes in a rash, hysterical manner," [...] and this point is made [...] "with an amusing cameo by Earvin 'Magic' Johnson". The San Diego Unions Fritz Quindt said the animators [...] "did [...] likeness good," [...] and noted that in the game the [...] "colors on the Lakers jerseys and the Forum court were correct. Chick Hearn and Stu Lantz were almost lifelike, announcing at courtside in Sunday-color-comics sweaters. And Chick's play-by-play was so real Stu couldn't <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> in." [...] Johnson's appearance was broadcast on CNN's Sports Tonight the day before the episode originally aired, and host Fred Hickman stated that he did not find it humorous.|$|E

2500|$|LaMarr {{auditioned for}} Tarantino because both {{had done a}} show for the Groundlings, an improv group, {{a few months before}} casting of the film began. In the audition, he read for Jules Winnfield and Brett. He {{described}} the filming experience of Pulp Fiction as [...] "the coolest, most easygoing, fun set I've ever been on ... Tarantino was fantastic. I mean, he can be almost unbearable as a person. At a party, you can't <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> in edgewise for, like, an hour. But as a director, he is so completely open and just... present. And he treated everybody on set well." ...|$|E
2500|$|French took on {{responsibility}} for air defence, although {{he agreed with}} Repington that it was [...] "a damnosa hereditas". He was frequently lobbied by local groups for better air defences. In January 1917 anti-aircraft guns were reallocated to anti-submarine warfare. [...] After the Gotha raids in July 1917 French {{was able to make}} a fuss at the War Cabinet (Robertson complained he could not <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> in edgeways) and show letters he had written urging greater priority for air defence. [...] A War Cabinet sub-committee was set up, nominally chaired by the Prime Minister but effectively run by J. C. Smuts, and French urged that air be treated as a separate department going forward (which eventually became the RAF). [...] More guns and fighter squadrons were provided, and Brigadier E.B. Ashmore was appointed to command London's air defence, reporting to French.|$|E
