5000|$|Felling - After {{clearing}} the tree's base undergrowth for the retreat path and the felling direction; felling is properly done with three main cuts. To control the fall, the directional cut line should run 1/4 {{of the tree}} diameter to make a 45-degree wedge, which should be 90 degrees to the felling direction and perfectly horizontal. Make the top cut first then, the bottom cut is made to form the directional cut line at the wedge point. A narrow or nonexistent hinge lessens felling direction control. From {{the opposite side of}} the wedge, plan to finish the final <b>felling</b> <b>cut</b> 1/10 of the tree diameter from the direction cut line. The <b>felling</b> <b>cut</b> is made horizontally and slightly (1.5-2 inches; [...] ) above the bottom cut. When the hinge is properly set, the <b>felling</b> <b>cut</b> will begin the fall in the desired direction. A sitback is when a tree moves back opposite the intended direction. Placing a wedge in the <b>felling</b> <b>cut</b> can prevent a sitback from pinching the saw.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work {{resulting}} in this report {{is to develop a}} mechanically enhanced breaking bar, or prying bar, for bringing down trees. There was already a prototype to study, which was assembled by welded steel components. A specification of demands took form after continuous technical discussions with the inventor, assignee and mentors. When an analysis of this device and its function was made, the work continued with calculations to establish the foundation to design a mechanical model. Geometrical relationships were established to design the sub-components of the breaking bar and its functions. Simulations regarding material strength and mechanical function were made by the use of different modules in the CAD-software Solid Works and led to a simplified version of the breaking bar. The new simplified version was accepted by the inventor and the drawings for the new tool could now be made. During the time of this work the inventor has prepared his patent request and therefore this work has been classified and considered under secrecy for the inner circle persons containing the Kogertek-employees. The breaking bar which was produced with its powerful gear ratio is amplifying the force from the handle by a factor 25 and lifts 50 mm in the <b>felling</b> <b>cut</b> of the tree. In theory the tool would weigh approximately 1800 grams and can be used to bring down a tree with a diameter of at most 40 cm. Drawings for the constituent components were sent to a workshop to be manufactured and a mechanical breaking bar was assembled and tested...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{with this}} study has been to build general models of the mechanics in tree felling with chain-saw and to compare felling torque for different tools. The theoretical models are completed and validated with a comparative study. The study includes {{a great number of}} felling tools of which some are used with different methods. Felling torque was measured using a naturally like measuring arrangement where a tree is cut at about 3. 7 m height and then anchored with a dynamometer to a tree opposite to the felling direction. Notch and <b>felling</b> <b>cut</b> was made as ordinary with exception that the hinge was made extra thin to reduce bending resistance. The tree was consequently not felled during the trials and several combinations of felling tools and individuals could be used on the same tree. The results show big differences between tools, methods and persons. The differences were, however, not general, but could vary depending on conditions (first of all tree diameters). Tools and methods that push or pull on the stem are little affected {{by the size of the}} tree, while tools that press on the stump are very much dependent of a large stump-diameter. Hand force asserted on a simple pole is consequently a powerful tool on small trees. For trees of medium size there are several alternative methods with different sizes and brands of felling levers and wedges. Larger and more ungainly tools and methods like tree pusher, winch, etc. develop very high felling torque on all tree sizes. On large trees also the felling wedge and especially the use of several wedges together develop very high felling torque...|$|E
40|$|Longitudinal {{patterns}} of within tree variation for basic density were determined for plantation Eucalyptus globulus (ages 5 and 10 years) and E. nitens (ages 5, 10 and 15 years) growing in three geographic areas in Tasmania. Each tree was sampled by taking discs {{from a combination}} of percentage heights (0, 10, 20 ___ 70 %) and fixed height samples (0. 5 m, 0. 7 m ___ 1. 5 m). At each of the fixed heights, a single pilodyn reading was taken from each of 4 aspects. Weighted whole tree density was calculated from the percentage height samples and used for correlation and regression analysis with the fixed height samples. Both species showed an initial drop in density between the <b>felling</b> <b>cut</b> (zero height) and 0. 5 m, followed by a linear increase in density between 10 % and 70 % of tree height. Slope of fitted regressions were parallel within species but differed significantly between the species (1. 14 kg/m 3 and 1. 62 kg/m 3 per 1 % increase in height above 10 % for E. globulus and E. nitens, respectively). Density at all fixed heights was highly correlated with whole tree values for E. globulus, but results were variable across sites for E. nitens. Both species were found to contain trees which produced aberrant pilodyn readings. For E. globulus, the optimal sampling height was 1. 3 m above ground and the mean pilodyn reading was found to predict whole tree density with an accuracy of ± 21 kg/m 3. For E. nitens, optimal sampling height was 1. 5 m above ground. However, pilodyn readings around the stem were not very repeatable and correlations with whole tree density were lower, resulting in the accuracy of prediction of whole tree density being ± 26 kg/m 3...|$|E

40|$|Storms causing {{windthrow}} {{are major}} natural disturbance events and an unpredictable hazard to forest planning. Knowledge of regional and seasonal climatic effects on sapstain and decay fungi will allow forest managers to minimise losses from wood deterioration during salvage operations. A {{study was conducted}} monitoring sapstain in trees that were experimentally felled to simulate storm breakage at up to four times during the year in. Pinus radiata plantations across six locations in different climatic zones throughout New Zealand. It was found that drying of sapwood and development of sapstain depended more on the season when the storm occurred, rather than the time since felling. Sapstain appeared almost immediately in stems felled during summer, at some locations reaching more than 20 % mean cross-sectional cover inside logs within 3. months, whereas in those felled during winter an initial lag phase during the cooler months preceded a more rapid rise during spring and summer. Rates varied substantially between locations with a tendency for faster deterioration where average temperatures were greater. For trees damaged during winter, {{it was predicted that}} a. P.. radiata butt log with a mid-length diameter of c. 16 - 23. cm will take from 2 to 8. months, depending on climate, to reach an economic damage benchmark threshold of 10 % cross-sectional sapstain cover. However, for storms in spring or summer this period reduces to less than 1. month at warmer locations. Development of sapstain was uniform or increased slightly with height along the felled stem, but was greatest close to the <b>felling</b> <b>cut</b> in the basal section that would normally be removed during log retrieval. The results of this study provide new information about the temporal and regional variation in the dynamics of sapstain fungi that will assist forest managers during timber recovery following storms in regions with similar climates and tree species...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{practical}} examples of small scale natural regeneration of common beech were investigated {{in the period}} 2006 – 2010. In Croatia, the research area consisted of forest administrations of Zagreb, Koprivnica, Karlovac, Plitvice Lakes National Park and Žumberak – Samoborsko Gorje Nature Park, and outside Croatia it included Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Slovakia and Slovenia (Fig. 1). This paper {{presents the results of}} research into small scale regeneration of common beech in the form of groups (Fig. 2, Table 1), using the example of a Dinaric montane beech forest (as. Lamio orvalae-Fagetum /Ht. 1938 / Borhidi 1963) and small-stand regeneration, using the example of a beech forest with sedge (as. Carici pilosae-Fagetum Oberforfer 1957). Natural regeneration in virgin beech stands begins in the form of clusters and groups (Fig. 3 and 4, Table 2). This regeneration method can be applied in special purpose forests and in protection forests, since it forms structurally diverse stands that will satisfy non-market forest goods and services of these forests. It is also suitable for private forest owners because not only does it enable the concentration of treatments in small areas, but also allows the planning of a continuous yield. Small scale regeneration with shelterwood cuts in large complexes of managed forests is both possible and desirable. Regeneration over small areas at the level of small (1 – 3 ha) and medium (3 – 5 ha) stands has proven successful (Fig. 5, Table 3). Compared with classical regular management over large areas, small scale management is a closer-to-nature and more intensive management method. It requires the construction of a silvicultural plan that contains a map of initial regeneration gaps and directions of its expansion. Silvicultural treatments are applied simultaneously, but {{in different parts of the}} regeneration area. This type of management alleviates the application and supervision of silvicultural treatments and enables long-term and continuous planning of the <b>felling</b> <b>cut...</b>|$|E

60|$|In one {{of these}} wars the Gauls came within three miles of Rome, and the two hosts were encamped {{on the banks of}} the Anio, with a bridge between them.
