5|$|Typhoon Imbudo was {{the strongest}} typhoon to strike Luzon since Typhoon Zeb five years prior, and was the fifth storm in eight weeks to affect the country. The typhoon left {{widespread}} areas flooded for several days. Cagayan Valley was largely isolated after a bridge was damaged in Ilocos Norte. Damage was heavy in the region, totaling P2.2billion (PHP, $40million USD), and over 80,000people were displaced by the storm. Damage was heaviest in Isabela, where damage was estimated at P1.9billion (PHP, $35million USD), mostly to crops and killed livestock. There, winds and rain knocked down trees and caused a province-wide power outage. Most trees {{less than three years}} old fell during the high winds. In Isabela province, the banana crop was almost entirely destroyed, and most of the corn and rice crops were heavily damaged. The high damage caused the gross regional product, or overall economy of the Cagayan Valley, to decrease by 0.3% than what would <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>without</b> the typhoon.|$|E
25|$|Suede {{appeared}} on Melody Maker's cover {{before they had}} a record out... The exposure got them a record deal, brought a bunch of like-minded acts to the public's attention, and helped create Britpop.

25|$|By 1952, as {{the funding}} ended, {{the economy of}} every {{participant}} state had surpassed pre-war levels; for all Marshall Plan recipients, output in 1951 was at least 35% higher than in 1938. Over the next two decades, Western Europe enjoyed unprecedented growth and prosperity, but economists are not sure what proportion was due directly to the ERP, what proportion indirectly, and how much would <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>without</b> it.|$|E

25|$|A VAT, {{like most}} taxes, distorts what would <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>without</b> it. Because {{the price for}} someone rises, the {{quantity}} of goods traded decreases. Correspondingly, some people are worse off by more than the government is made better off by tax income. That is, more is lost due to supply and demand shifts than is gained in tax. This {{is known as a}} deadweight loss. If the income lost by the economy is greater than the government's income; the tax is inefficient. It must be noted that a VAT and a Non-VAT have the same implications on the microeconomic model.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{also note}} that Robert Young, the {{traveling}} companion with whom victim Russell Nelson was visiting Chicago {{at the time of}} his disappearance in October 1977, gave differing accounts of the youth's disappearance to both Nelson's family and investigators. To Nelson's family, Young had stated Nelson failed to arrive at a bar at a prearranged time; to investigators, Young claimed he had last seen Nelson standing among a crowd who had gathered outside a Chicago bar and when his (Young's) attention was diverted for a few moments, Nelson simply disappeared. Investigators contend this could not <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>without</b> his traveling companion noticing.|$|E
25|$|Under the , local {{authorities}} {{are required to}} consider measures to improve the energy efficiency of all residential accommodation in their areas, although they {{are not required to}} implement any measures. Most {{local authorities}} provide free advice on energy conservation and some also provide home visits, often targeting those in social housing and the fuel poor. Some also demand minimum levels of energy efficiency in newly constructed buildings. It was expected that the Act would result in a 30% cut in energy usage between 1996 and 2010. An overall cumulative improvement of 14.7% was reported to DEFRA for the year ending March 2004, but a large part of this would <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>without</b> HECA.|$|E

50|$|The {{announcement}} {{on the night}} of 25 July 1990 by the President of Fiji of a new Constitution came as a complete shock to many of the people of Fiji as it <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>without</b> any prelude. Initially, those opposed to the imposition of the new constitution, and brave enough to express their views, began expressing their opposition to the new constitution through letters to the media. But the interim government was adamant that the constitution was there to stay and did everything in its power to create an impression that the unilaterally-imposed Constitution had been accepted by all citizens of Fiji.|$|R
25|$|The looting of the city's {{treasury}} {{could not}} <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>without</b> {{the help of}} {{the most powerful man in}} San Francisco, David Broderick, who was a state senator and held tight control over San Francisco from 1851 until his death in 1859. Broderick's corruption was such that no man could be elected to public office unless he made a deal with Broderick to share half the profits from his office. As a result of these backroom deals, Broderick accumulated a large amount of wealth which further strengthened his position as a powerful city boss. As news of the treasury's financial crisis became known, another even larger uprising of enraged citizenry would occur.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Albert (21–3 August) saw Third Army {{push forward}} up to 4,000 yards over an 11 mile front, taking 5,000 prisoners, with Fourth Army attacking on the {{southern}} flank - in Gary Sheffield's description, a victory for ordinary British troops which would not <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>without</b> Haig’s prodding of Byng. The attacks continued for another two days, then on 26 August Currie’s Canadian Corps, now part of First Army, attacked at Arras further north. Haig wrote to his wife that this, the Battle of the Scarpe, was “the greatest victory which a British Army has ever achieved”, and although it did not achieve quite the planned level of success – cavalry, including a brigade of infantry in buses, had been ready to exploit – Ludendorff ordered further withdrawals that evening, including the ground gained by “Georgette” in April.|$|E
25|$|Chainfire {{continues}} {{the story of}} Richard {{in his attempt to}} teach the people that their lives are theirs alone, and that they can be free of the Imperial Order. Richard is gravely injured from an enemy's arrow. He is brought to Nicci, a sorceress and former Sister of the Dark, who heals him using Subtractive Magic; this causes unforeseen events to spiral out of control. When Richard awakens, he discovers that his wife, Kahlan Amnell, the Mother Confessor, is missing. Furthermore, no one around him seems to remember her. Nicci and Cara both attribute Richard's memory of Kahlan to dreams and delusions brought on by his injury and possibly an unintended effect of the Subtractive Magic used in healing Richard. Despite Richard's attempts to explain {{the events of the last}} several years could not <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>without</b> Kahlan, the paradoxes are explained away as Richard remembering things inaccurately.|$|E
60|$|And now {{instead of}} endeavoring to set down the matter in his words, and lest I should make a mistake in repeating them, let me write here that which I read in plain print some time after the colonies had won their freedom from the king. It was written by one who strove to tell all that <b>had</b> <b>happened,</b> <b>without</b> taking either the Whig or Tory side, and, so far as I {{have been able to}} learn, is true {{concerning}} what took place in that village of York up to the close of this day of which I am writing.|$|R

The unusual noise and confusion in the house had reached her ears, {{and she had been}} told what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>without</b> sufficient caution being exercised in preparing her to hear it. In her weak, nervous state, the shock of the intelligence had quite prostrated her. She had fallen into a swoon, and had been brought back to her senses with the greatest difficulty. As to giving me or anybody else directions what to do under the embarrassing circumstances which had now occurred, she was totally incapable of the effort.|$|R
2500|$|Boone wrote Questions About God with {{reporter}} Cord Cooper. He told The 700 Club in 2009, [...] "The {{big question}} is there a God? Is God real? How do we know? Is there proof? So this fella, Cord Cooper, and I decided we needed to answer three basic questions in a very simple form, but I think substantively and really bares no rational refutation... We quote Einstein and Stephen Hawking, who is still living, the most brilliant man on the planet. As they say, it's inconceivable that all this <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>without</b> a plan, without a blueprint, without some designer who created the design. So this book is so simple, yet I think profound truth." ...|$|R

500|$|Nothing would <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>without</b> the Pistols. It was like, [...] "Wow, I {{believe in}} this." [...] What {{they were saying}} was: [...] "It's a load of shite.

People forget that, but it was the main {{ideology}} for me: we don't care what you think—you're shit anyway. It was the attitude that got people moving, as well as the music.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the events}} that gave Betances great {{satisfaction}} was the abolition of slavery in Puerto Rico, which was made official on March 22, 1873. He reminded people that abolition would not <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>without</b> the direct intervention of Puerto Ricans in the Spanish political process, and was thus hopeful that the islanders would assume a more proactive role in seeking their freedom from Spain. With time, Betances became essentially the representative of the liberal governments of the Dominican Republic {{for as long as they}} lasted, and the representative of the Cuban [...] "government in arms", or insurrection.|$|E

6000|$|The {{policeman}} {{took the}} pistol, looked at it, then at Olive, {{then at the}} captain, and then down at the body on the steps. He {{was trying to get}} an idea of what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>without</b> asking. If the negro had not been present he might have asked questions, but this was an unusual situation, and he felt his responsibility, and his importance. Olive now stepped toward him, and in obedience to her quick gesture he bent his head, and she whispered something to him. Instantly he was quivering with excitement. He thrust the pistol into his pocket, and turned to the negro. [...] "Run," [...] said he, [...] "and get your cab! Don't say a word to a soul and I will give you five dollars." ...|$|R
2500|$|This was a film where Balachander was {{considered}} successful in reflecting {{the thoughts of}} Ilayaraaja. Innovatively there is no use of Mridangam in the song [...] "Mahaganapathim".

500|$|Solanas {{has also}} been {{credited}} with instigating radical feminism. Catherine Lord wrote that [...] "the feminist movement would not <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>without</b> Valerie Solanas." [...] Lord believed that the reissuing of the SCUM Manifesto and the disowning of Solanas by [...] "women's liberation politicos" [...] triggered a wave of radical feminist publications. According to Vivian Gornick, many of the women's liberation activists who initially distanced themselves from Solanas changed their minds a year later, developing {{the first wave of}} radical feminism. At the same time, perceptions of Warhol were transformed from largely nonpolitical into political martyrdom because the motive for the shooting was political, according to Harding and Victor Bockris.|$|E
500|$|David's writing had {{an impact}} on the {{cultural}} approach of the British towards food. According to the food journalist Joanna Blythman, she [...] "performed both a cultural and gastronomic miracle in post-war Britain by introducing the nation to a vision of fresh Continental food", while the writer Rose Prince considers that David [...] "changed for ever the way British people cook". Janet Floyd, professor of American Literature at King's College London, considers that David was not a driver of change, but came to epitomise that change. The literary historian Nicola Humble observes that [...] "the food revolution of the post-war years would probably <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>without</b> Elizabeth David, though in her absence it would have happened very differently".|$|E
500|$|Sports {{gambling}} expert R. J. Bell, {{president of}} sports betting information site Pregame.com, tracked every game Donaghy worked from 2003 to 2007. [...] He discovered {{that during the}} two seasons investigated by the NBA, the teams involved scored more points than expected by the Las Vegas sports books 57 percent of the time. In the previous two seasons, this only happened 44 percent of the time. According to Bell, the odds of such a discrepancy are 1 in 1,000, and there was [...] "a 99.9 percent chance that these results would not <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>without</b> an outside factor." [...] He also found 10 straight games in 2007 in which Donaghy worked the game that the point spread moved 1.5 points or more before the tip— an indication that big money had been wagered on the game. The big money won every time—another indication that [...] "something (was) going on". [...] However, Bell suggested {{that there was no}} way anyone who wasn't in on the fix could have known that something was amiss about Donaghy's actions during a game; he said it would have been another year at the earliest before anyone could have caught on.|$|E

40|$|Value {{for money}} (VFM) {{is a concept}} that is {{understood}} instinctively by most people in terms of the way it conditions the majority of everyday purchases. However, promoting the concept as a major agenda item within the international development sector has been more problematic, largely because this <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>without</b> strong methodological guidance from within the sector. As practice {{over the past few years}} demonstrates, the VFM concept has often been applied either vaguely, so meaning different things to different people, or narrowly, defined as relating simply to cost. This paper gives an overview of the origins and definitions of VFM, and then seeks to provide a framework that will both clarify the definition and broaden the application of the concept.

6000|$|Mrs. Presty {{followed}} them, {{and begged}} earnestly for leave to wait {{the result of}} the momentous experiment, at the door of Kitty's bedroom. Her self-asserting manner had vanished; she was quiet, she was even humble. While the last chance for the child's life was fast becoming a matter of minutes only, the grandmother's better nature showed itself on the surface. Randal opened the door for them as the three went out together. He was in that state of maddening anxiety about his poor little niece in which men of his imaginative temperament become morbid, and say strangely inappropriate things. In the same breath with which he implored his sister-in-law to let him hear what <b>had</b> <b>happened,</b> <b>without</b> an instant of delay, he startled Mrs. Presty by one of his familiar remarks on the inconsistencies in her character.
