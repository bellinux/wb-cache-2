40|$|Since {{the problem}} of {{disclosing}} personal information on the Internet continues to increase, many anonymous communication systems have been studied. Such systems usually use <b>directory</b> <b>servers</b> to manage public keys of participant nodes. However, this reduces anonymity because the query messages for the <b>directory</b> <b>servers</b> can give adversaries route information of anonymous communication channels. To solve this problem, applying ID-Based Encryption has been proposed, but in the existing method, <b>directory</b> <b>servers</b> continue to exist. Our novel method, which can grasp assigned NodeIDs without <b>directory</b> <b>servers,</b> {{can be applied to}} existing DHT-based anonymous communication systems. Our proposal enhances scalability. This paper describes the structure of our proposed system and its application...|$|R

Red Hat <b>Directory</b> <b>Server</b> differs from 389 in that the former is rebranded with the Red Hat branding, and includes certified stable builds, customer service, and technical support. Red Hat will rebase the Red Hat version with a stable upstream 389 branch in line with Red Hat Enterprise Linux releases, and backport new features and critical bug fixes as necessary. The 389 source code is generally available under the GPLv3 license. Some components have an exception for plugin code, while other components use LGPLv2 or Apache.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} novel efficient {{techniques for}} the distributed evaluation of hierarchical aggregate selection queries over LDAP directory data, distributed across multiple autonomous <b>directory</b> <b>servers.</b> Such queries {{are useful for}} emerging applications like the Directory Enabled Networks initiative. Our techniques follow the LDAP approach of distributed query evaluation by referrals, where each relevant server computes answers locally and the LDAP client coordinates between <b>directory</b> <b>servers.</b> We make a conceptual separation between the identification of relevant servers and the distributed computation of answers. We focus on the challenging task of generating an efficient plan for evaluating hierarchical aggregate selection queries, which involves correlating directory entries across multiple servers. The key features of our plan are: 1) The network traffic consists of query answers and auxiliary messages that depend only {{on the number of}} servers {{and the size of the}} query (not on the data size), 2) the coordination effort at the client is independent of the data size, and 3) potentially expensive server-to-server communication and coordination is avoided...|$|R
