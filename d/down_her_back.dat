25|$|Pepé Le Pew storylines {{typically}} involve Pepé {{in pursuit}} of a female black cat, whom Pepé mistakes for a skunk ("la belle femme skunk fatale"). The cat, who was retroactively named Penelope Pussycat, often has a white stripe painted <b>down</b> <b>her</b> <b>back,</b> usually by accident (such as by squeezing under a fence with wet white paint). Penelope frantically races to get away from him because of his putrid odour, his overly aggressive manner or both, while Pepé hops after her at a leisurely pace.|$|E
500|$|Sean Garrett {{appears in}} the video and Birdman, Amber Rose, and Ringmasters of Season 3 of America's Best Dance Crew make cameos. The video premiered on BET's 106 & Park on March 31, 2010 [...] The video {{comprises}} a helicopter chase and militaristic desert and jungle scenes. The music video begins with Birdman giving Minaj a stack of money to carry to an unknown area in the desert. As the song begins Minaj appears in a blonde wig with a pink background which than cuts to Minaj riding in a pink Lamborghini with Amber Rose driving as a potential new take on Thelma & Louise in a helicopter chase. Shots of desert creatures and Minaj in her Barbie wig are shown during the first hook. As the helicopter chase progresses, Minaj is seen singing to the camera in military gear and is later shown walking in an attacking line with her Harajuku Army, which are all dressed in the same gear with pink wigs under helmets. During the chorus of the song, a shirtless Garrett is shown singing into the camera while clips of the helicopter chase are interpreted. During the second verse Minaj is in the jungle as a ninja with a long pink braid running <b>down</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> as she crawls {{on the ground and}} walks around the jungle. Some clips of two men (from Ringmasters) dancing with double-jointed shoulders are also shown. During the climax of the song Minaj is still in the jungle this time with a green wig were dancing in the mud and comes out of the water, crawling through the forest. The video ends as clips of the entire video are shown and closes with Minaj and Rose escaping in the pink Lamborghini.|$|E
