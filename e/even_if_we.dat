5|$|Kant {{believed}} that the Categorical Imperative provides us with the maxim that {{we ought not to}} lie in any circumstances, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> are trying to bring about good consequences, such as lying to a murderer to prevent them from finding their intended victim. Kant argued that, because we cannot fully know what the consequences of any action will be, the result might be unexpectedly harmful. Therefore, we ought to act to avoid the known wrong—lying—rather than to avoid a potential wrong. If there are harmful consequences, we are blameless because we acted according to our duty. Driver argues that this might not be a problem if we choose to formulate our maxims differently: the maxim 'I will lie to save an innocent life' can be universalized. However, this new maxim may still treat the murderer as a means to an end, which we have a duty to avoid doing. Thus we may still be required to tell the truth to the murderer in Kant's example.|$|E

25|$|Another fact of note is {{that the}} {{integers}} under multiplication is not a group, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> exclude zero. This is easily seen by the nonexistence of an inverse for all elements other than 1 andnbsp&−1.|$|E
25|$|We have to {{consider}} 8 or 9 days for a large scaled encircling manoeuvre.

25|$|A {{division}} ring is a generalization of field. Division rings are not {{assumed to be}} commutative. There are no non-commutative finite {{division ring}}s: Wedderburn's little theorem states that all finite division rings are commutative, hence finite fields. The result holds <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> relax associativity and consider alternative rings, by the Artin–Zorn theorem.|$|E
25|$|If these {{dates are}} revised, the {{divergence}} times estimated from molecular data will change as well. However, the relative divergence times {{are unlikely to}} change. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can't tell absolute divergence times exactly, we can be pretty sure that the divergence time between chimpanzees and humans is about sixfold shorter than between chimpanzees (or humans) and monkeys.|$|E

25|$|Joseph Levine's paper Conceivability, Identity, and the Explanatory Gap {{takes up}} where the criticisms of conceivability arguments, such as the {{inverted}} spectrum argument and the zombie argument, leave off. Levine agrees that conceivability is flawed {{as a means of}} establishing metaphysical realities, but points out that <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> come to the metaphysical conclusion that qualia are physical, there is still an explanatory problem.|$|E
25|$|Given {{that reason}} alone cannot {{determine}} whether God exists, Pascal concludes that this question functions like a coin toss. However, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> {{do not know}} the outcome of this coin toss, we must base our actions on some expectation about the outcome. We must decide whether to live as though God exists, or whether to live as though God does not exist, even though we may be mistaken in either case.|$|E

After the couple married, Allen began writing material for them to use together ("With a vaudeville act, Portland and I could be together, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> couldn't find any work"), and the couple divided their time between the show business circuit, Allen's New England family home and Old Orchard Beach, Maine, in summers.|$|E

25|$|What {{this means}} is that <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> have {{extracted}} all possible energy from a Fermi gas by cooling it to near absolute zero temperature, the fermions are still moving around at a high speed. The fastest ones are moving at a velocity corresponding to a kinetic energy equal to the Fermi energy. This is the Fermi velocity. Only when the temperature exceeds the Fermi temperature do the electrons begin to move significantly faster than at absolute zero.|$|E
25|$|This {{statement}} of the mean value property can be generalized as follows: If h is any spherically symmetric function supported in B(x,r) such that ∫h = 1, then u(x) = h * u(x). In other words, we can take the weighted average of u about a point and recover u(x). In particular, by taking h to be a C∞ function, we can recover the value of u at any point <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> only know how u acts as a distribution. See Weyl's lemma.|$|E
25|$|We {{know our}} human bodies have {{boundaries}} and occupy space, {{the same way}} other objects known only through our named senses do. Though we seldom think of our body as a physical object, we know even before reflection that it shares some of an object's properties. We understand that a watermelon cannot successfully occupy the same space as an oncoming truck; we know that if we tried to repeat the experiment with our own body, we would obtain similar results—we know this <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> {{do not understand the}} physics involved.|$|E
5000|$|Kurosawa's {{habitual}} {{method was}} to edit a film daily, bit by bit, during production. This helped particularly {{when he started}} using multiple cameras, {{which resulted in a}} large amount of film to assemble. [...] "I always edit in the <b>evening</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> have a fair amount of footage in the can. After watching the rushes, I usually go to the editing room and work." [...] Because of this practice of editing as he went along, the post-production period for a Kurosawa film could be startlingly brief: Yojimbo had its Japanese premiere on April 20, 1961, four days after shooting concluded on April 16.|$|R

25|$|As {{a general}} example, if a null {{hypothesis}} {{is assumed to}} follow the standard normal distribution N(0,1), then the rejection of this null hypothesis can either mean (i) the mean is not zero, or (ii) the variance is not unity, or (iii) the distribution is not normal, {{depending on the type}} of test performed. However, supposing we manage to reject the zero mean hypothesis, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> know the distribution is normal and variance is unity, the null hypothesis test does not tell us which non-zero value we should adopt as the new mean.|$|E
25|$|English text, {{treated as}} a string of characters, has fairly low entropy, i.e., is fairly predictable. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> do not know exactly {{what is going to}} come next, we can be fairly certain that, for example, 'e' will be far more common than 'z', that the {{combination}} 'qu' will be much more common than any other combination with a 'q' in it, and that the combination 'th' will be more common than 'z', 'q', or 'qu'. After the first few letters one can often guess the rest of the word. English text has between 0.6 and 1.3 bits of entropy per character of the message.|$|E
25|$|In pre-modern {{societies}}, it was {{the elders}} who possessed the knowledge: they were definable in time and space. In modern societies we must rely on expert systems. These are not present in time and space, but we must trust them. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> trust them, we know that something could go wrong: there's always a risk we have to take. Also the technologies which we use, and which transform constraints into means, hold risks. Consequently, {{there is always a}} heightened sense of uncertainty in contemporary societies. It is also in this regard that Giddens uses the image of a 'juggernaut': modernity is said to be like an unsteerable juggernaut travelling through space.|$|E
