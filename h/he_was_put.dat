5|$|Another origin tale {{claims that}} King Solomon {{was given a}} pure Arabian-type mare named Safanad ("the pure") by the Queen of Sheba. A {{different}} version says that Solomon gave a stallion, Zad el-Raheb or Zad-el-Rakib ("Gift to the Rider"), to the Banu Azd people {{when they came to}} pay tribute to the king. This legendary stallion was said to be faster than the zebra and the gazelle, and every hunt with him was successful, thus when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>put</b> to stud, he became a founding sire of legend.|$|E

5|$|Following Sean's {{birth in}} 1975, Lennon took a hiatus {{from the music}} {{industry}} and became a househusband to care for his infant son. He resumed his songwriting career shortly before his December 1980 murder, which Ono witnessed at close range. She has stated that the couple was thinking about going out to dinner after spending several hours in a recording studio, but were returning to their apartment instead, because Lennon wanted to see Sean before <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>put</b> to bed. Following the murder, Ono went into complete seclusion for an extended period.|$|E

5|$|Before the war <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>put</b> {{in charge}} of {{analyzing}} technical advances {{at home and abroad}} and his enthusiasm for innovation earned him the nickname Armee Modernissimus ("the army modernization fanatic"). Model fought nearly all his battles in the northern and central parts of the Eastern Front; he was never tested on the steppes of southern Russia, where the open terrain would have made mobile warfare a more attractive proposition. Nevertheless, his defensive record indicated the value of his approach. At Rzhev, Orel, in Galicia and in Estonia he stymied opponents who expected to overwhelm him, and as late as November 1944, he gave the U.S. 12th Army Group a bloody nose in the Battle of Hürtgen Forest.|$|E

In November 1832, he succeeded his brother John as pastor of Second Presbyterian Church of Baltimore, Maryland. His tenure saw numerous converts, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>put</b> at odds with his brother and Samuel Miller over practices employed in his church. His counselors were also concerned that he was wavering on {{his belief in the}} doctrine of limited atonement. Eventually, he was persuaded back into the doctrines of the orthodox Calvinism and became {{one of the leaders of}} the Old School Presbyterian movement.|$|E

5|$|Brooks' first {{venture into}} wrestling was {{a stint in}} a {{backyard}} wrestling federation called the Lunatic Wrestling Federation with his friends and brother Mike Brooks in the mid-late 1990s. He first started using the ring name CM Punk when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>put</b> into a tag team named The Chick Magnets with CM Venom after another performer skipped out on the card. Unlike his friends, Punk genuinely {{wanted to be a}} wrestler and saw it as more than simple fun.

They have not spoken since.|$|E
5|$|Cranmer's role in {{politics}} was diminishing when on 16 October 1551 Seymour {{was arrested on}} charges of treason. In December <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>put</b> on trial and although acquitted of treason, he was judged guilty of felony and put to death on 22 January 1552. This {{was the beginning of}} the breach between Cranmer and Dudley. It was aggravated during the year by the gradual appropriation of ecclesiastical property by the regency. However, even throughout this political turmoil, Cranmer worked simultaneously on three major projects in his reform programme: the revision of canon law, the revision of the Prayer Book, and the formation of a statement of doctrine.|$|E
5|$|Euryalus {{became the}} {{flagship}} of Rear Admiral Rosslyn Wemyss in April, after <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>put</b> {{in charge of}} the main landings at Gallipoli.

She also bombarded Turkish positions during the Second Battle of Krithia on 6 May. A month later, Wemyss hauled down his flag and resumed his original commanding of the Allied base at Mudros. Euryalus received a brief refit at Malta from 30 December 1915 to 20 January 1916 before proceeding to Egypt to reinforce the defences there.|$|E
