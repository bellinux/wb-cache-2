In this system, a novel MU-MIMO detection method, named weighted minimum distance (wMD) decoding, was recently proposed by introducing an equivalent coding problem. Despite of its attractive performance, the wMD decoding has the two limitations {{to be used in}} practice: i) the hard-decision outputs can degrade the performance of a channel code; ii) the computational complexity grows exponentially with the K. To address those problems, we first present a soft-output wMD decoding that efficiently computes soft metrics (i. e., log-likelihood ratios) from one-bit quantized observations. We then construct a low-complexity (soft-output) wMD decoding by introducing <b>hierarchical</b> <b>code</b> partitioning. This method can be regarded as a sphere decoding in Hamming space, in that a search-spare is considerably reduced.

40|$|Despite {{advances}} in cartography, mapping {{is still a}} costly process which involves {{a substantial amount of}} manual work. This article presents a method for automatically deriving road attributes by analyzing and mining movement trajectories (e. g. GPS tracks). We have investigated the automatic extraction of eight road attributes: directionality, speed limit, number of lanes, access, average speed, congestion, importance, and geometric offset; and we have developed a supervised classification method (decision tree) to infer them. The extraction of most of these attributes has not been investigated previously. We have implemented our method in a software prototype and we automatically update the OpenStreetMap (OSM) dataset of the Netherlands, increasing its level of completeness. The validation of the classification shows variable levels of accuracy, e. g. whether a road is a one- or a two-way road is classified with an accuracy of 99 %, and the accuracy for the speed limit is 69 %. When taking into account speed limits that are one step away (e. g. 60 km/h instead of the classified 50 km/h) the classification increases to 95 %, which might be acceptable in some use-cases.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{applications}} that use maps, and more detailed the maps are, more applications {{can benefit from}} the map. Many maps are still manually created and also the underlying attributes are informed in a manual process. This thesis presents a method to automatically derive and update attribute road data by mining and analyzing movement trajectories. The method used for this thesis implemented OpenStreetMap as the underlying map which will be updated. GPS tracks are the movement trajectories {{that will be used}} to derive the information for the road attributes. There are attributes that are already conceptually present in OpenStreetMap but are in practice rarely filled. The attributes that will be investigated to derive are: whether the road is a one or two way road, the speed limit of the road, the number of lanes of the road and which vehicles have access to the road. Also, new attributes are introduced in this thesis. These are the average speed of the road, the hours in which the road is congested, the importance of the road and whether the road has a certain geometrical error. Preprocessing is performed before the attributes can be derived. Important are the classification of the transportation mode of the GPS tracks and the map matching of the GPS points to the roads they are on. When the IDs of the roads, where the GPS points are on, are known the attribute extraction algorithms can be applied. These algorithms all have different methods for deriving their attributes. There are attributes that use the speed of the GPS point, the distance from the point to the road or the heading of the point. For some attributes, a <b>hierarchical</b> <b>code</b> list is created to provide different perspectives on the error of the attributes. The code list consists of the values of the attributes and the hierarchy between these lists describes the level of detail and the granularity of the values. While some attributes were classified correctly in almost 100 % of the cases, the extraction of the attributes were not all successful. The number of lanes proved to be too difficult to derive out of the available data and the importance of a road relies on a complete coverage of data which was not the case. Although, the latter is applied in this research. The other attributes had different results, the accuracy of the classification of the speed limit was 69, 2 %. However, when taking into account speed limits that are only one step away (e. g. 60 km/h instead of the classified 50 km/h) the classification increases to 95 %. The classification of the roads that allow bicycles was 74 % and the attribute to determine whether a road is a one or two way road has a classification accuracy of 99 %. In the future, the attribute extraction algorithms could be improved or expanded. More detailed levels in the <b>hierarchical</b> <b>code</b> list could be added and constraints could be added to improve the attributes. Also, some techniques might be enhanced for better results. Finally, the ideal application of this method would be deriving and updating the attributes in real-time. This could lead to live maps which would change real-time with the changes on the road.

The advent of Galileo, the European satellite navigation project, will allow a deeper impact in the quality of services supplied to the users, and consequently, into diffusion and development of mass market receivers. Obviously, in order to respond to mobility demands, an important aim will be to guarantee continuous outdoor and indoor location availability. The main challenging problem for indoor location is to find a solution between low signal to noise ratios characteristic of indoor scenario, and low complexity of user terminals. In a noise limited situation like this, to ensure a good synchronization, it is necessary to integrate over a longer period, with inevitable increase of complexity. The analysis done in this paper is based on acquisition of Galileo pilot signal in L 1 band, L 1 -C signal, that is a <b>hierarchical</b> <b>code,</b> constituted by a repetition of a 4092 chips primary code, modulated by a long duration secondary code of 25 chips. The resulting code has a total length of 102300 chips [1]. In this way, it is possible to achieve synchronization in two phases: the first step foresees the acquisition of the primary code synchronism, while the synchronization with the overlaying secondary code is pursued in the second phase with a limited uncertainty equal to only 25 acquisition hypothesis. Generally, the integration over a word of 4092 chips is not enough to cope with the harsh indoor scenario when performing the primary code synchronization. A classic approach to overcome this problem consists in trying to detect not a single primary code sequence, but a larger number of sequences, up to the entire 102300 chips concatenated code word. This approach has the great disadvantage t...|$|E
40|$|Building Information Models (e. g. BIM, IFC) {{and virtual}} 3 D city models (e. g. CityGML) are revolutionising {{the way we}} manage {{information}} about cities. The main focus of such models is on the physical and functional characteristics of urban structures (Aien et al, 2015). On the other hand cadastral data models, (e. g. Land Administration Domain Model (LADM)), {{have been developed for}} legal information modelling and management purposes without providing correspondence to the object’s physical counterperts. However, by definition, those two aspects need to be interrelated; i. e. a tunnel, a building, a mine, etc. always have both a legal status and boundaries as well as a physical description; while it is evident that their integration would maximise their utility and flexibility to support different applications. In order to examine the correlation between those aspects, a prototype system was developed based on model driven architecture practices, empahasizing in formalization of constraints. Constraints have been proved effective in providing solutions needed to avoid errors and enable maintenance of data quality; thus the need to specify and implement them is vital. The paper explores possibilities of linking 3 D legal right, restriction, responsibilities (RRR) spaces, modelled with LADM (LADM, ISO 19152), with physical reality of 3 D objects (described via CityGML, IFC, InfraGML, etc). During this implementation, INTERLIS, a standard modelling language for geodata exchange, was selected as modelling language, because of its claimed good support of constraints in vendor neutral manner and ease of obtaining actual implementation. The system’s development cycle, from conceptual model to implementation of working prototype is illustrated through a proposed model for a Multipurpose Land Administation System (MLAS) for Greece. The prototype is developed in order to evaluate the strengths and limitations of the proposed conceptual model, as well as to investigate the efficiency and limitations of the existing technological (INTERLIS) tools. The process followed during the prototype development is cyclical and repetitive, providing feedback to the initial model during all the stages and improving it in terms of efficiency, reality and technical implementation. Main challenges among others during the system’s development cycle include the following: 1. how to express various LADM constraints (OCL and semiformal in standard) formally in INTERLIS, 2. how to include extensible <b>hierarchical</b> <b>code</b> lists in INTERLIS models (not natively available) and distinguish them from enumeration values, 3. how to model 3 D volumetric primitives in INTERLIS (not natively available) and 4. how to link two models (legal - physical) using cross domain constraints.  Department of GIS Technolog...|$|E
40|$|The massive {{developments}} and uses of high rise buildings {{indicate that the}} demand for use of space {{above and below the}} ground surface is rapidly increasing in recent years. In the context of this thesis, the research is focused on exploring the possibilities of linking 3 D legal RRR spaces, modeled with LADM (ISO 19152), with physical reality of 3 D objects. The possibilities are explored towards the development of a prototype which is elaborated in two core stages: At first, a physical model is derived from the corresponding conceptual model, using existing national and international standards and then, its efficiency is tested using real world sample data, querying the database and visualizing the result in 3 D environment. The conceptual modeling of the proposed model is based on the "people to land" relationship using LADM core concepts described with UML diagrams. Towards the conversion from conceptual model to implementation of a working prototype, the model is first converted into the INTERLIS modeling language, in order to be formally expressed including various constraints in a platform/ vendor neutral manner. INTERLIS is a standard modeling language for geodata exchange which is used to provide more direct implementable models {{and at the same time}} support the constraints. The model described, initially, with UML diagrams and especially the constraints in OCL cannot be automatically converted into implementations. During the prototype, emphasis is given at the exploitation of the capabilities of INTERLIS, under the scope of LADM, which is used in actual implementation of land administration system. INTERLIS tools are used to automatically generate implementation components for specific environments; e. g. database schema or exchange file format. Challenges among others during the system's development cycle include the following: how to express the various LADM constraints OCL and semi-formal in standard) formally in INTERLIS, how to include extensible <b>hierarchical</b> <b>code</b> lists in INTERLIS models (not natively available) and distinguish them from enumeration values, how to model 3 D volumetric primitives in INTERLIS (not natively available), how to link two models (legal - physical) using cross domain constraints, etc. The system’s development cycle, is illustrated with a proposed model for MLAS in Greece. The model is based on international standards, covering a broader perspective than the existing one used today, including several types of objects and interests that are not currently registered by the Hellenic Cadastre. More precisely, utility networks (both the legal and their physical counterpart), planning zones, marine parcels and 3 D (land) parcels are now included at the proposed model and organized appropriately. The different types of spatial units are organized in levels according to the LA_Level structure of LADM, ISO 19152. This model is considered as an effort for overcoming these shortcomings, based on international standards, including the representation of a wide range of different types of spatial units, in three dimensions, aiming to establish an appropriate basis for the NSDI of Greece. It is a flexible proposal for comprehensive multipurpose LAS supporting both 2 D and 3 D cadastral registration in Greece. The prototype is developed in order to evaluate the strengths and limitations of the proposed conceptual model (linking legal and physical objects), as well as to investigate the efficiency and limitations of the existing technological (INTERLIS) tools. The process followed during the prototype development is cyclical and repetitive, providing feedback to the initial model during all the stages and improving it in terms of efficiency, reality and technical implementation. Finally, differences and similarities are mentioned from the comparison of the final (corrected) conceptual model, which results after the evaluation of the prototype, with the initial one. Conclusions and remarks made based on the database queries and visualization, as well as similarities, differences and patterns can be observed between the legal and physical objects.

The methods were tested with Brodatz textures and real photo. <b>Hierarchical</b> <b>coding</b> without subtractions was found as the most effective method for the Hermite transform based texture identification. The method was also applied {{to the problem of}} texture based image segmentation...|$|R
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} as European Journal of Cognitive Psychology, Vol. 22, Issue 2, March 2010, pp. 216 - 246. It is available from: [URL] only entryFour experiments are reported that demonstrate {{the benefits of}} clustering by spatial proximity in spatial serial recall and provide support for the notion that <b>hierarchical</b> <b>coding</b> underpins the retention of clustered sequences in spatial working memory. Sequences segregated by spatial clusters increased serial recall performance {{at different levels of}} sequence length in a variation of the Corsi test and produced a faster initial response time (RT), which indicates that they afforded data reducing processes. RT at cluster boundary increased in parallel with the number of items forming the clusters, suggesting that subroutines of different length were responsible for the ordering of items within clusters of different size. Evidence for <b>hierarchical</b> <b>coding</b> was also obtained in a serial recognition task, indicating this type of representation pertains to the retention of the sequences rather than exclusively to the organisation of the motor plan for the reproduction of the sequences...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{attention}} that <b>hierarchical</b> B picture <b>coding</b> has received, {{little attention has been}} given to a related technique called <b>hierarchical</b> P picture <b>coding.</b> P picture only coding without reverse prediction is necessary in constrained bit rate applications that require ultra-low delay and/or low complexity, such as videoconferencing. Such systems, however, have been using the traditional IPPP picture coding structure almost exclusively. In this paper, we investigate the use of <b>hierarchical</b> P <b>coding</b> vs. traditional IPPP coding and demonstrate that it has significant advantages which have not yet been well documented or understood. From a pure coding efficiency point of view, we show that for encoders configured to use ultra-low delay and low complexity <b>coding</b> tools, <b>hierarchical</b> P <b>coding</b> achieves an average advantage of 7. 86 % BD-rate and 0. 34 dB BD-SNR.

The suggested approach enhances the variable rate coding by zero tree based block-coding architecture with Context Modeling for low complexity and high performance.
