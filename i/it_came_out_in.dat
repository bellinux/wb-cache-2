25|$|As a Christian {{democratic}} party, Fine Gael was historically pro-life (supportive of {{the child}} in the womb and the mother). It has however frequently disagreed with various pro-life organisations in Ireland. In 1983, having initially supported the proposal, <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> opposition to the Eighth Amendment to the Irish Constitution that was being submitted in a referendum in 1983. Under then leader and Taoiseach Dr Garret FitzGerald it campaigned for a 'No' vote, arguing, on the advice of the Attorney General of Ireland Peter Sutherland, that the wording, which had been drafted under the previous government, when analysed was ambiguous and open to many interpretations. This referendum resulted in the Eighth Amendment to the Irish constitution, giving the unborn child a qualified equal right to life to that of the mother. Its stance conflicted with that of the Pro-Life Amendment Campaign (PLAC) and the Roman Catholic bishops, and Fianna Fáil, the largest party in the State at the time, but then in opposition.|$|E

[...] Kellman selected [...] "Amor Gitano", [...] "Irreemplazable" [...] and the [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] remix as the highlights of the EP.

It turned out that he directed very...It was a great script, a great cast, and he ended up directing a home run. One of the charming things about it was the end, where we had these alien heads placed on young children. It was so endearing to see them on the set between takes, playing with Chris and everyone". Actor David Duchovny said of Carter's directing [...] "Chris came in meticulously prepared, which is his nature. I think his first episode was great".

In a 2007 issue of Rolling Stone, Robert Christgau and David Fricke named it one of the 40 essential albums of 1967; Christgau declared: [...] "Towering it's not; some kind of hit it is." [...] In 2001, Spencer Owen of Pitchfork awarded the album a 9.5/10 score, and wrote [...] "Smiley Smile is a near-masterpiece.

500|$|Village Green {{eventually}} {{morphed into}} their next album, The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society, released in late 1968 in the UK. A collection of thematic vignettes of English town and hamlet life, it was assembled from songs written and recorded {{over the previous}} two years. It was greeted with almost unanimously positive reviews from both UK and US rock critics, yet failed to sell strongly. One factor in the album's initial commercial failure {{was the lack of}} a popular single. It did not include the moderately successful [...] "Days"; [...] "Starstruck" [...] was released in North America and continental Europe, but was unsuccessful. Though a commercial disappointment, Village Green (the project's original name was adopted as shorthand for the long album title) was embraced by the new underground rock press when <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> January 1969 in the United States, where the Kinks began to acquire a reputation as a cult band. In The Village Voice, a newly hired Robert Christgau called it [...] "the best album of the year so far". The underground Boston paper Fusion published a review stating, [...] "the Kinks continue, despite the odds, the bad press and their demonstrated lot, to come across.... Their persistence is dignified, their virtues are stoic. The Kinks are forever, only for now in modern dress." [...] The record did not escape criticism, however. In the student paper California Tech, one writer commented that it was [...] "schmaltz rock ... without imagination, poorly arranged and a poor copy of The Beatles". Although it sold only an estimated 100,000copies worldwide on its initial release, it has since become the Kinks' best-selling original record. The album remains popular; in 2004, it was re-released in a 3-CD [...] "Deluxe" [...] edition and one of its tracks, [...] "Picture Book", was featured in a popular Hewlett-Packard television commercial, helping to boost the album's popularity considerably.|$|E
