5000|$|Because {{the upper}} wing tilted, {{it had to}} be a {{cantilever}} structure. It was built around two wooden spars and was mounted at its centre on a chordwise circular cross-section rod, fixed to the fuselage, which acted as a hinge and allowed the wing to see-saw. When the Jona J-6 appeared at the Milan show in 1935, the year before its first flight, this hinge was held above the fuselage on a faired column, but before it flew this was replaced by four pairs of faired V-form struts with their eight ends fixed to it. [...] Control wires from the ailerons were attached to the fixed <b>hinge</b> <b>rod,</b> providing the required automatic deflections as the wing tilted. The rate of tilt was limited by a pair of telescopic, sprung struts from mid-chord quite close to the centreline, which met at the bottom centre of the fuselage after passing in through the upper sides. These could be hydraulically locked for aerobatics and spins or when stabilisation was not wanted. Leading edge automatic Handley Page slots were fitted to prevent spinning via wingtip stalling. The wing was plywood-covered and straight-tapered in plan form, with semi-elliptical tips. The lower wing was generally similar, though much smaller and rigidly mounted. Though not required when the automatic lateral control system was engaged, conventional, pilot operated ailerons were later added to the lower wing.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: A rigid {{construct}} {{that employs}} an occipital plate and upper cervical screws and rods {{is the current}} standard treatment for craniovertebral junction (CVJ) instability. A rod is contoured to accommodate the occipitocervical angle. Fatigue failure has been associated these acute bends. <b>Hinged</b> <b>rod</b> systems {{have been developed to}} obviate intraoperative rod contouring. Object: The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the safety and efficacy of the <b>hinged</b> <b>rod</b> system in occipitocervical fusion. Materials and Methods: This study retrospectively evaluated 39 patients who underwent occipitocervical arthrodesis. Twenty patients were treated with <b>hinged</b> <b>rods</b> versus 19 with contoured rods. Clinical and radiographic data were compared and analyzed. Results: Preoperative and postoperative Nurick and Frankel scores were similar between both groups. The use of allograft, autograft or bone morphogenetic protein was similar in both groups. The average number of levels fused was 4. 1 (± 2. 4) and 3. 4 (± 2) for <b>hinged</b> and contoured <b>rods,</b> respectively. The operative time, estimated blood loss, and length of stay were similar between both groups. The occiput to C 2 angle was similarly maintained in both groups and all patients demonstrated no movement across the CVJ on flexion-extension X-rays during their last follow-up. The average follow-up for the <b>hinged</b> and contoured <b>rod</b> groups was 12. 2 months and 15. 9 months, respectively. Conclusion: <b>Hinged</b> <b>rods</b> provide a safe and effective alternative to contoured rods during occipitocervical arthrodesis...|$|R

40|$|To {{understand}} how a woodpecker is able accelerate its head to such a high velocity in {{a short amount of}} time, a multi-rigid-segment model of a woodpecker's body is established in this study. Based on the skeletal specimen of the woodpecker and several videos of woodpeckers pecking, the parameters of a three-degree-of-freedom system are determined. The high velocity of the head is found {{to be the result of}} a whipping effect, which could be affected by muscle torque and tendon stiffness. The mechanism of whipping is analyzed by comparing the response of a <b>hinged</b> <b>rod</b> to that of a rigid rod. Depending on the parameters, the dynamic behavior of a <b>hinged</b> <b>rod</b> is classified into three response modes. Of these, a high free-end velocity could be achieved in mode II. The model is then generalized to a multihinge condition, and the free-end velocity is found to increase with hinge number, which explains the high free-end velocity resulting from whipping. Furthermore, the effects of some other factors, such as damping and mass distribution, on the velocity are also discussed...|$|R

25|$|Some of {{the first}} boiler tubes, {{particularly}} the du Temple with its sharp corners, could not be cleaned of scale internally. Tubes were later cleaned internally by attempting to pass a <b>hinged</b> <b>rod</b> through, with a brush at the end. For the curved tube designs, often {{only part of the}} tube could be reached. Another method was to pass a chain down the tube from above, pulling a brush behind it, although this was unworkable for boilers like the Thornycroft where the tubes first travelled horizontally or upwards. The eventual method was to use 'bullet' brushes that were fired from one drum into the other by use of compressed air. Sets of brushes were used, one for each tube, and they were carefully numbered and counted afterwards to ensure that none had been left behind, blocking a tube.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The term {{biological}} motion {{has been}} coined by Johansson (1973) {{to refer to}} the ambulatory pat-terns of terrestrial bipeds and quadripeds. In this paper a computational theory of the visual perception of biological motion is proposed. The specific problem addressed is how the three dimensional structure and motions of animal limbs may be computed from the two dimensional motions of their projected images. It is noted that the limbs of animals typically do not move arbitrarily during ambulation. Rather, for anatomical reasons, they typically move in single planes for extended periods of time. This simple anatomical constraint is exploited as the basis for utilizing a &quot;planarity assumption &quot; in the interpretation of biological motion. The analysis proposed is: (1) divide the image into groups of two or three elements each; (2) test each group for pairwise-rigid planar motion; (3) combine the results from (2). Fundamental to the analysis are two &quot;structure from planar motion&quot; propositions. The first states that the structure and motion of two points rigidly linked and rotating in a plane is recoverable from three orthographic pro-jections. The second states that the structure and motion of three points forming two <b>hinged</b> <b>rods</b> con-strained to move in a plane is recoverable from two orthographic projections. The psychological relevance of the analysis and possible interactions with top down recognition processes are discussed. 1...|$|R

50|$|In general, all {{railroad}} vehicles have spring suspension; without springs, {{irregularities in}} the track could lift wheels off {{the rail and}} cause impact damage to both rails and vehicles. Driving wheels are typically mounted so that they have around 1 inch (2.5 cm) of vertical motion. When there are only 2 coupled axles, this range of motion places only slight stress on the crank pins. With more axles, however, provision {{must be made to}} allow each axle to move vertically independently of the others without bending the rods. This may be done by <b>hinging</b> the side <b>rod</b> at each intermediate crank pin, either using the pin itself as a hinge pin, or adding a hinge joint adjacent to the pin, as shown in the illustration.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} {{the feasibility of}} using aerobraking tethers for {{the exploration of the}} solar system. The basic concept involves an orbiter and a probe connected by a thin tether. The probe is deployed into the atmosphere of a planet where aerodynamic drag decelerates it. The tension on the tether provides the braking effect on the orbiter, thus eliminating the need for a propulsive maneuver. During the maneuver the orbiter travels outside the atmosphere, and does not require heat shielding. After aerocapture has occurred, the tether may be severed allowing the probe to land on the planet, or the system may remain together and additional maneuvers can be performed to finalize the orbit. ^ Initially a rigid rod model is used to demonstrate the superiority of the aerobraking technique over traditional chemical retro-rocket maneuvers in missions to the atmosphere-bearing planets. These findings are then confirmed with a more complex flexible model consisting of a collection of <b>hinged</b> rigid <b>rods.</b> Further reductions in the tether mass are realized through optimization techniques. ^ The aerobraking tether is proven to be physically feasible, even when bending effects are included in the model. This provides the basis for a new class of exotic spacecraft for the exploration of the solar system with the potential for significant propellant savings. ...|$|R
50|$|Most {{motorcycles}} of {{this period}} tensioned the primary chain by drawing or rotating the gearbox backwards on a <b>hinge</b> with threaded <b>rods,</b> this was known as pre-unit construction. The first A7 had a fixed gearbox, bolted {{to the back of}} the crankcase, and an internal tensioner for the duplex primary chain. This gave it the appearance of unit construction and pioneered the system later used in unit-construction engines such as the BSA C15, BSA B40, Triumph 3TA and so on. However, in 1954 a re-design reverted to the older system. The electrics (as was universal for larger British motorcycles of the period) consisted of two independent systems, the very reliable and self-contained Lucas magneto, with a dynamo generator to charge the battery and provide lights. Carburation was a single Amal remote float Type 6 until 1955 when it was upgraded to a 376 Monobloc.|$|R

5000|$|After World War II, Puch split-single {{production}} and racing were restarted in 1949 with an improved system of one connecting <b>rod</b> <b>hinged</b> {{on the back}} of the other. These engines typically use the forward piston to control both intake and exhaust ports, with the interesting result that the carburettor is at the front of the engine, under and to the side of the exhaust. The rear piston controls the transfer port from the crankshaft to the cylinder. Increasingly, these models were fitted with an oil mixing pump, fed from a reservoir incorporated in the petrol tank. Some also have a twin-spark plug ignition system firing an almost figure-eight shaped combustion chamber. Sears marketed considerable numbers of the Puch SGS split-single fitted with both these innovations as the [...] "Allstate 250" [...] or [...] "Twingle" [...] in the US.

30|$|One of the {{problems}} of human aging is wearing joints, which relate to a sharp increase in abundance of various afflictions of the skeletal and joint system including fractures, vertebral degenerations, arthritis, and bone tumors. Orthopedic surgeries using artificial implants are currently the main method used for structural and functional renewal of damaged bones and joints. Materials used commonly for orthopedic implants are especially metals, ceramics, polymers, and composites. Metal implants (e.g., gold) are widely used in the clinical practice either as permanent replacements (e.g., hip replacements, artificial teeth) or as temporal prostheses (e.g., discs, <b>hinges,</b> screws, and <b>rods</b> used to fix fractures). Metals are favored due to their mechanical strength, resistance to wear, and nontoxicity [1 – 3]. On the other hand, their high mechanical strength and low elasticity are incompatible with the human skeletal tissue. This might {{have a negative impact on}} a bone implant, which can lead to absorption of an adjoined bone tissue and release of the implant. Polymers such as ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE), polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), polylactide (PLA), polyglycolide (PGA), and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) are widely used in various biomedical applications. But only a limited number of polymers have been used as bone or joint replacements, since they tend to be too flexible and weak to comply with demands placed on mechanical orthopedic implants [4, 5].|$|R
40|$|We report {{here that}} the catch and {{striated}} adductor muscle myosin heavy-chain (MHC) isoforms of scallop (Argopecten irradians, previously Aequipecten irradians) are generated by alternative RNA splicing from a single gene. Scallop catch muscle cDNA and genomic DNA were amplified by PCR using primers based on the previously sequenced scallop striated muscle MHC cDNA. Mapping of the exon/intron borders and sequencing of a full-length catch muscle MHC in overlapping fragments revealed that the 24 -kb gene encodes the MHC polypeptide in 27 exons and that four sets of tandem exon pairs are alternatively spliced into a striated and a catch MHC isoform. An additional alternative exon was identified in catch cDNA and is apparently spliced into a minor MHC isoform. The striated muscle-specific isoform is not expressed in other tissues, whereas the catch-type isoforms were also detected in various smooth muscles, {{but not in the}} striated one. Of the alternative exons, exons 5 and 6 encode part of the ATP-binding region and the 25 -kDa/ 50 -kDa proteolytic junction; exon 13 encodes part of one of the actin-binding regions and extends to the active site; exon 20 encodes the middle of the <b>rod</b> <b>hinge</b> region; exon 26 in the striated-specific sequence starts with the stop codon, whereas the catch-specific exon codes for an additional 10 residues. Differences between the alternative exons presumably determine the lower ATPase activity of smooth muscle myosin, contribute to the different structure of the striated and smooth muscle thick filaments, and may also be important for the molecular mechanism of the catch phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|Electric {{birefringence}} {{measurements and}} depolarized light scattering experiments were performed with HMM, LMM, and rod, the three fragments of myosin, under conditions (0. 3 M KCl, 0. 02 M PO 4, pH 7. 3) the medium currently used for biochemical assays of myosin in its native state {{as well as}} of its subfragments. The comparison of myosin and rod relaxation times (17. 2 and 22. 8 microseconds, respectively) suggests that the average bend angle in the tail is sharper in intact myosin (90 degrees) whereas rod, when detached from the heads, is a more elongated species with an average bend angle of 120 - 135 degrees. The LMM relaxation time (6. 4 microseconds) is consistent with a rigid linear stick model of length 78 nm. Flexibility in myosin tail is thus confirmed as located in the HMM-LMM <b>hinge.</b> LMM and <b>rod</b> did not exhibit any significant variation of their apparent relaxation times with concentration and the decay curves were best fitted by a single exponential, evidence that the concentration of parallel staggered dimers was negligible in the concentration range studied here (0 - 7 g/l). This observation lends support to previous results obtained with myosin. Respective HMM, LMM, and rod molecular weights and homogeneity as evaluated by SDS-PAGE analysis were correlated to the Kerr constants of their solutions. Large variations in LMM Kerr constants could be related to the loss of a COOH-terminal peptide on prolonged chymotryptic digestion.

Results: We have determined by multiple anomalous dispersion (MAD) with Lu 3 + the 2. 7 Å crystal structure of a 4. 5 S RNA fragment containing binding sites for both Ffh and EF-G. This fragment consists of three helices connected by a symmetric and an asymmetric internal loop.

40|$|Several flight regimes {{occurring}} {{during a}} typical aircraft mission {{make it impossible}} to define a unique optimized wing configuration able to maximize aerodynamic efficiency, maneuverability, and stability in every flight condition. Components like ailerons and flaps, in some way, guarantee a certain level of adaptability, being far from optimal. Wing morphing can strongly improve the aerodynamic efficiency of future aircraft by assuring an optimal adaptive behavior which best fits the specific flight regime requirements. Such an approach, in spite of related benefits, presents a challenging problem: the same structure rigid enough to keep its shape under the aerodynamic loads has to largely deform itself without undergoing structural collapses. In the frame of a research project funded by Alenia Aeronautica S. p. A., the authors came to the definition of a novel morphing architecture acting as high-lift device. In this study, the design assessment of an innovative flap architecture for a variable-camber trailing edge is illustrated. The reference geometry is based on a full-scale wing of a reference civil regional transportation aircraft, where the conventional flap component has been substituted by a morphing trailing edge based on compliant ribs. The presented architecture moves toward the direction of assuring high deformability while keeping good load-sustaining capabilities: each rib is composed of multiple, suitably shaped rigid elements connected by means of <b>hinges</b> and linking <b>rods.</b> The rib’s shape changes upon the activation of a smart actuator based on shape memory alloy technology.

40|$|Flying insects need {{to detect}} {{unwanted}} movements {{of their own}} bodies, {{so that they can}} make any necessary corrections to restore the status quo. They need to know, for example, when their flight is disturbed by an eddy in turbulent air or by an imperfectly executed wing beat. Dragonflies depend on sight for this information. That works well in bright daylight but would not be satisfactory in near-darkness because eyes cannot provide precise information quickly in dim light. Moths active at night need information about unwanted movements to maintain flight stability, especially when hovering to collect nectar from flowers. On page 863 of this issue, Sane and colleagues (1) explain how a hawk moth senses its own rotations. These researchers found that the moth’s movement-detection system depends largely on the Coriolis effect, which keeps spinning gyroscopes stable. This effect is an apparent deflection of an object viewed in a rotating frame of reference, seemingly attributable to an apparent force. We already knew of the importance of Coriolis forces for dipteran flies (house flies, mosquitoes, etc.). Instead of having four wings like other insects, dipterans have only two. Their hind wings have been reduced to tiny club-shaped halteres (see the figure) that beat at the same frequency as the fore wings. If their halteres are cut off, these flies become unstable in flight and soon crash to the ground. Pringle (2) explained how Coriolis forces on the halteres inform flies of rotations of their bodies, enabling them to fly stably. Sane et al. now find that hawk moths can do this with their antennae, although detection of aerodynamic as well as Coriolis forces may have a role. In the diagram, a rod representing a fly’s body is rotating with constant angular velocity in the plane of the page. At the same time, a haltere <b>hinged</b> to the <b>rod</b> moves in a plane perpendicular to the paper. As th...|$|R
