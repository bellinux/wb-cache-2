5|$|Bree and her husband, Orson (Kyle MacLachlan), find it {{increasingly}} difficult to stage her fake pregnancy. Their hoax is almost revealed at a neighborhood barbecue when a fork stabs her pregnancy stomach pads. Orson suggests coming clean to avoid the humiliation if their lies were to be discovered, but Bree tells <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> child is her second chance at successfully raising a child. Meanwhile, Susan worries that Mike is dissatisfied with their marriage, especially after Adam, her new gynecologist, reveals that she may be entering menopause. However, Adam later informs Susan that his earlier assessment was a mistake and that she is pregnant.|$|E
5|$|When {{the council}} {{objects to the}} Duke's {{increasing}} usurpation of power and abrogation of the constitution, Süß suggests to <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> challenge to his authority can be suppressed by dismissing the council and restructuring the government so that the Duke can reign as an absolute monarch. Süß tells the Duke that he can accomplish this by hiring mercenaries and that, {{as a sign of}} their gratitude, the Jews of Württemberg will provide all the requisite funds. Süß argues that he would be most effective if the Duke were to give him a letter granting him immunity from the laws of Württemberg. The Duke demurs at first but ultimately grants Süß's request.|$|E
5|$|While the Beagle {{surveyed}} {{the coasts of}} South America from February 1832 to September 1835, Darwin made several trips inland and found extensive evidence that the continent was gradually rising. After witnessing an erupting volcano from the ship, he experienced the 1835 Concepción earthquake. In the following months he speculated that as the land was uplifted, {{large areas of the}} ocean bed subsided. It struck <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> could explain the formation of atolls.|$|E

5|$|After {{the subject}} of {{business}} was eschewed for a few days, Thompson explained to the king in Setswana what he and his confederates had come to talk about. He said that his backers, unlike the Transvaalers, were not seeking land, but only wanted to mine gold in the Zambezi–Limpopo watershed. During the following weeks, talks took place sporadically. Moffat, who had remained in Bulawayo, was occasionally called upon by the king for advice, prompting the missionary to subtly assist Rudd's team through his counsel. He urged Lobengula to work alongside one large entity rather than many small concerns, telling <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> would make the issue {{easier for him to}} manage. He then informed the king that Shippard was going to pay an official visit during October, and advised him not to make a decision until after this was over.|$|E
5|$|Craig, leaving Alfie with a store clerk, {{follows the}} Doctor into the tunnel, {{and is also}} {{captured}} and placed into a conversion machine. The Doctor reveals his own impending death and urges Craig to fight, but the conversion appears to be complete. Alfie's cries over the closed-circuit television echo in the ship. Craig, encouraged by the Doctor telling <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is his {{chance to be a}} father, fights and reverses the conversion. The rest of the Cybermen painfully experience the emotions they have repressed from Craig's struggle, and their circuits start to overload. The Doctor and Craig escape via the teleporter as the ship explodes, the blast contained by the cavern. Craig reunites with Alfie, while the Doctor slips away unseen. Craig returns home to find the Doctor already there, having used time travel to clean the house. The Doctor tells Craig that Alfie now has a much higher opinion of his dad. The Doctor leaves just before Sophie returns but Alfie's first word ('Doctor') reveal the events during her absence.|$|E
5|$|Geppetto {{discovers that}} his wish has come true, and {{is filled with}} joy. However, {{on his way to}} school, Pinocchio is led astray by Honest John the Fox and his companion, Gideon the Cat, who {{convince}} him to join Stromboli's puppet show, despite Jiminy's objections. Pinocchio becomes Stromboli's star attraction as a marionette who can sing and dance without strings. However, when Pinocchio wants to go home for the night, Stromboli locks him in a birdcage. Jiminy arrives to see Pinocchio, and is unable to free him. The Blue Fairy appears, and asks Pinocchio why he was not at school. Jiminy urges Pinocchio to tell the truth, but instead he starts telling lies, which causes his nose to grow longer and longer. Pinocchio vows to be good from now on, and the Blue Fairy returns his nose to its original form and sets him free, while warning <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> will be the last time she can help him.|$|E

25|$|Palmer {{was arrested}} on the charge of murder and forgery (a {{creditor}} had told the police his suspicions that Palmer had been forging his mother's signature) and detained at Stafford Gaol; he threatened to go on hunger strike, but backed down when the governor informed <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> would lead to his being force fed.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after Mantle {{completed}} treatment, his son Billy died on March 12, 1994, at age 36 {{of heart}} problems {{brought on by}} years of substance abuse. Despite the fears of those who knew <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> tragedy would send him back to drinking, he remained sober. Mickey Jr. later died of liver cancer on December 20, 2000, at age 47. Danny later battled prostate cancer.|$|E

25|$|Queensberry's {{attorney}} {{announced in}} court that he had located several male prostitutes who were to testify that they had had sex with Wilde. Wilde's lawyers advised <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> would make a conviction on the libel charge very unlikely; he then dropped the libel charge, on his lawyers' advice, to avoid further pointless scandal. Without a conviction, the libel law of the time left Wilde liable to pay Queensberry's considerable legal costs, which left him bankrupt.|$|E
25|$|In Wolverine & the X-Men #4 (March 2012), Evan Sabahnur a.k.a. Genesis is {{admitted}} {{as a student}} to the Jean Grey School of Higher Learning, where his classmates notice his resemblance to Apocalypse. En is worried when a visiting Deathlok, who reveals to the students their likely futures, shows reluctance to do so with Evan. When Evan presses him, Deathlok informs <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is what Evan is at the school to discover. Deathlok then tells Wolverine that Evan has great potential and may be a great savior, or a conqueror.|$|E
25|$|McNulty {{has been}} voicing the killer in {{telephone}} calls to Templeton. After doing the voice analysis, the FBI provides McNulty and Greggs with a psychological {{profile of the}} homeless killer, inadvertently giving a near-perfect description of McNulty himself. Having his character flaws spelled out for him gives McNulty second thoughts about what he has done. He confesses his deception to Greggs, who in turn informs Daniels, now the BPD's Deputy Commissioner for Operations. Daniels and Pearlman subsequently meet with Acting Commissioner Rawls, State's Attorney Rupert Bond, and the mayor's office. Daniels and Rawls confront McNulty, informing <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> will be his last CID case.|$|E

25|$|Since {{receiving}} Dr. Morse's {{opinion that}} his daughter had died from pancreatitis, Robinson had been consulting doctors on the matter, who had advised <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was an unlikely cause of death. On the morning of Friday, March 21, the day of Joan Robinson Hill's funeral, Ash Robinson visited the office of Assistant District Attorney I. D. McMaster, where he accused John Hill of killing his wife, telling McMaster of the circumstances surrounding her death and autopsy. McMaster asked Harris County Medical Examiner Joseph Jachimczyk {{to go to the}} funeral home to examine the body before the funeral. Jachimczyk ordered Morse to hand over blood and urine specimens taken from Robinson Hill. He then drove to the funeral home to view the body.|$|E
25|$|Though Ghulam Ahmad further {{declared}} on 8 April 1886 {{that it was}} {{disclosed to}} <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> son will be born within a period of nine years, however {{a few days after}} this announcement his wife, Nusrat Jehan gave birth to a daughter and his adversaries began alleging that his prophecy was proved false. Again in August 1887 a son was born to him but died in infancy, and again his critics alleged that the prophecy was falsified. Ghulam Ahmad pointed out that this son was the 'guest' that was promised, and that the prophecy concerning the promised son began from the passage He will be accompanied by grace (Fazl) which shall arrive with him. On 12 January 1889, Mirza Mahmood Ahmad was born who is believed by the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community to be the promised son and one who displayed in his person all the qualities mentioned in the prophecy.|$|E
25|$|At Cabinet on 15 June, Reynaud {{urged the}} Cabinet {{to adopt the}} Dutch example, that the Army should lay down its arms so that the fight could be {{continued}} from abroad; Pétain was sympathetic. Pétain was sent to speak to General Weygand (who was waiting outside, as {{he was not a}} member of the Cabinet). Weygand persuaded <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> would be a shameful surrender. Chautemps then suggested a fudge proposal, an inquiry about terms. The Cabinet voted 13-6 for the Chautemps proposal. Reynaud tried to resign on the spot but Lebrun shouted at him. Admiral Darlan, who had been opposed to an armistice until 15 June, now agreed, provided the French fleet was kept out of German hands. On 15 June, Reynaud threw two glasses of water over de Portes at dinner; a key telegram had been found in her bed after it went missing.|$|E

25|$|Stephenson's {{most visible}} {{decision}} {{was to use}} {{a single pair of}} driving wheels, with a small carrying axle behind. This was the first 0-2-2 and first single driver locomotive. The use of single drivers gave several advantages. The weight of coupling rods was avoided and the second axle could be smaller and lightweight, as it only carried a small proportion of the weight. Rocket placed just over 2½tons of its 4¼ton total weight onto its driving wheels, a higher axle load than Sans Pareil, even though the 0-4-0 was heavier overall at 5ton, and officially disqualified by being over the 4½ton limit. Early locomotive designers had been concerned that the adhesion of a locomotive's driving wheels would be inadequate, but Stephenson's past experience convinced <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> would not be a problem, particularly with the light trains of the trials contest.|$|E
25|$|To {{the south}} in the Saar-Palatinate region, Lieutenant General George S. Patton's U.S. 3rd Army had dealt a devastating blow to the German 7th Army and, in {{conjunction}} with the U.S. 7th Army, had nearly destroyed the German 1st Army. In five days of battle, from 18–22 March, Patton's forces captured over 68,000 Germans. These bold actions eliminated the last German positions west of the Rhine. Although Montgomery's drive was still planned as the main effort, Eisenhower believed that the momentum of the American forces to the south should not be squandered by having them merely hold the line at the Rhine or make only limited diversionary attacks beyond it. By the end of March, the Supreme Commander thus leaned toward a decision to place more responsibility on his southern forces. The events of {{the first few days of}} the final campaign would be enough to convince <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was the proper course of action.|$|E
25|$|Later, Sae {{leaves for}} New York and meets up with Junichi, and they worked {{together}} in the same company. Junichi proposed to Sae later on. Sae returned to Kushiro to attend her friend Minami's wedding, and she found out that Kouhei was married to Ritsuko. However, Ritsuko was jealous of the way Sae and her husband were interacting. Kouhei then met Sae at the lighthouse, and Sae tells <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> might be the last time she visits Japan since she may get married. Having seen each other after such a long time, they can't resist anymore and they embrace each other passionately in front of Sae's house while dropping her off, but their responsibilities towards their better halves (in her case, her fiancé) force them to reluctantly part ways. When Kouhei returned, he found Ritsuko waiting for him on the steps with bad news- the bank might make them bankrupt. Kouhei manages to settle the problem, but he found Ritsuko's divorce papers on the table when he returned. The scene ends with a news report stating that Junichi was killed in Iraq.|$|E
