25|$|Though the reputations of many {{of these}} writers had faded by the mid-20th century, the {{influence}} of the symbolist movement was nonetheless profound. This was especially true in the case of Innokenty Annensky, whose <b>definitive</b> <b>collection</b> of verse, Cypress Box, was published posthumously (1909). Sometimes cited as a Slavic counterpart to the accursed poets, Annensky managed to render into Russian the essential intonations of Baudelaire and Verlaine, while the subtle music, ominous allusions, arcane vocabulary, and the spell of minutely changing colours and odours in his poetry were all his own. His influence on the acmeist school of Russian poetry (Akhmatova, Gumilyov, Mandelshtam) was paramount.|$|E
