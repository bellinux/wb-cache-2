40|$|A {{model is}} {{proposed}} {{to study the}} dynamic response of cargo pendulum vibrations. Equations of motion are obtained by Lagrange equations using Lagrange multiplier. Two independent bumpers of the securing cargo are considered in the model. Bumpers forces are represented by a special stiffness and damping {{as a function of}} phase coordinates. Investigation was performed for: a) transient motion from free initial conditions; b) stationary motion excitation from constrained string or hull bumpers vibrations; c) joint transient and excitation motion take into account random parameters. Results of investigations may be used for cargo <b>fastening</b> <b>inside</b> trailer, ship or airplane...|$|R
60|$|At last {{he reached}} the window. It {{was made of the}} small {{diamond-shaped}} panes at that time in general use. Holding the rope with one hand and his legs, he dashed the other hand through a pane, just where he judged the <b>fastening</b> <b>inside</b> would be. Three panes were beaten in before he felt the latch. This was easily turned. The frame opened outward, and he had some difficulty in pulling it past him; then, grasping the woodwork, he drew himself in, and with a great effort succeeded in gaining a sufficient holding to enable him to leave go of the rope, and make good his footing inside.|$|R
60|$|He turned away, {{and tried}} the Lock-house door. It was <b>fastened</b> on the <b>inside.</b>|$|R
60|$|The small {{door of the}} coach-house was <b>fastened</b> <b>inside,</b> but {{the large}} one had a padlock on it; and this being quickly unfastened, one half swung open, and the little girls ran in, too eager and curious even to cry out when they found {{themselves}} at last in possession of the long-coveted old carriage. A dusty, musty concern enough; {{but it had a}} high seat, a door, steps that let down, and many other charms which rendered it most desirable in the eyes of children.|$|E
6000|$|Towards evening, when I felt {{assured that}} all his {{performances}} and rituals must be over, I {{went up to}} his room and knocked at the door; but no answer. I tried to open it, but it was <b>fastened</b> <b>inside.</b> [...] "Queequeg," [...] said I softly through the key-hole:--all silent. [...] "I say, Queequeg! why don't you speak? It's I--Ishmael." [...] But all remained still as before. I began to grow alarmed. I had allowed him such abundant time; I thought he might have had an apoplectic fit. I looked through the key-hole; but the door opening into an odd corner of the room, the key-hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one. I could only see part of the foot-board of the bed and a line of the wall, but nothing more. I was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden shaft of Queequeg's harpoon, which the landlady the evening previous had taken from him, before our mounting to the chamber. That's strange, thought I; but at any rate, since the harpoon stands yonder, and he seldom or never goes abroad without it, therefore he must be inside here, and no possible mistake.|$|E
5000|$|While not all {{action figures}} include accessories, the {{additional}} items often prove essential to characters and their effectiveness as interactive toys. Typical 3¾" [...] scale G.I. Joe figures include several intricately sculpted guns or hand weapons {{that can be}} <b>fastened</b> <b>inside</b> the figures' hands. Missile launchers are also commonplace in military and comic book figure lines and usually involve a spring-loaded mechanism. However, possibly due to safety concerns, this method saw {{a decline in the}} mid-1990s. Some figures, particularly of the Joker, have incorporated water-squirting weapons.|$|E

5000|$|During the Second Boer War (1899-1902), British {{troops were}} given an iron ration made of four ounces of pemmican and four ounces of {{chocolate}} and sugar. The pemmican would keep in perfect condition for decades. [...] It was considered much superior to biltong, a form of cured game meats commonly used in Africa. This iron ration was prepared in two small tins (soldered together) which were <b>fastened</b> <b>inside</b> the soldiers' belts. It was the last ration used and it was used {{only as a last}} resort—when ordered by the commanding officer. A man could march on this for 36 hours before he began to drop from hunger.|$|E
5000|$|The hull was {{of round}} bilge wooden construction, planked with two diagonally opposed skins {{with a layer}} of oiled calico between them - known as a “double-diagonal” technique. The hull was {{completed}} with frames or “timbers” riveted perpendicularly from the keel to the gunwale {{on the inside of the}} planking, forming a very strong hull. The hull was further strengthened by the addition of longitudinal stringers riveted inside the timbers together with further timbers, known as [...] "web frames". They were <b>fastened</b> <b>inside</b> the stringers opposite every third main timber. HDMLs were fitted with a deeper section rubbing strake aft. Its purpose was to roll depth charges (kept in and delivered from racks on the side decks) clear of the hull and propellers.|$|E
5000|$|The Goodyear Type AD {{was a small}} airship {{built in}} the United States in the mid-1920s. The first example, christened Pilgrim, was Goodyear's first civil airship, and their first airship to use helium as its lift gas. Originally {{intended}} for pleasure cruising, it soon found its true calling as a promotional vehicle as the first [...] "Goodyear Blimp" [...] in a line that has continued for over ninety years. The Type AD was a conventional blimp design with a gondola that could carry two passengers {{in addition to the}} flight crew. While usually described as a non-rigid type, the design in fact incorporated a triangular-section magnesium girder as a keel, <b>fastened</b> <b>inside</b> the envelope. The craft carried its own collapsible mooring mast which allowed it to [...] "land" [...] anywhere that 250 ft × 250 ft (76 m × 76 m) of clear ground was available.|$|E
5000|$|Monkgomery has a rear {{opening that}} allows {{manipulation}} of mouth movements by hand. This opening also gave {{access to a}} pressure-sensitive switch {{on the top of}} the mouth and a solid mass at the bottom to engage the switch mechanism. Engagement triggers the electronic speech integrated circuit TMS5110ANL. Speech consisted of a set of 400 pre-recorded words (100 phrases), in voiceover format (performed by Bill Cochran), stored in Texas Instrument CM62060N2L, CM62059N2L, E7CL04N2L ICs. The words played out on an 8 Ω, 0.25 watt F.S.T F05702 mono speaker. The board contained a never-used nine pin edge connector for expansion modules. These parts were built into a brown plastic box with a 4-AA battery holder. The brown box was zipped inside the back of the monkey's back with two snaps for <b>fastening</b> <b>inside</b> and a removable eight pin connector cable for interactions with mouth switch, [...] "tickle" [...] sensors, right ear and right foot.|$|R

50|$|Early long boats {{used some}} form of {{steering}} oar but by the 10th century the side rudder (called a steerboard, the source for the etymology for the word starboard itself) was well established. It consisted of a length of timber about 2.4 m long. The upper section was rounded to a diameter of about 150 mm. The lower blade was about 1.8 x 0.4 m. The steerboard on the Gokstad ship in the Viking Ship Museum in Oslo, Norway, is about 8 in wide, completely flat inboard and with about a 3 in maximum width {{at the center of}} the foil. The head of the rudder shaft had two square holes about 200 - 300 mm apart. When the rudder was in its normal position the tiller was inserted in the upper hole so that the tiller faced athwartwise. The shaft was attached to the gunwale by a U shaped joint. Near the stern, about halfway down the starboard topsides, was a rounded wooden block about 150 mm in diameter and 100 mm high, with a central hole for a rope. This corresponded to a hole in the midsection of the rudder blade. From the outside the rope ran through the blade, through the round block and topsides and was <b>fastened</b> <b>inside</b> the hull. The flexibility of the hemp rope allowed the blade to pivot. When beached or in shallow water the tiller was moved to the lower hole, the blade rope was slackened and the rudder head pulled up so the rudder could operate in shallow waters. Modern facsimiles are reported to steer quite well but require a very large amount of physical effort compared to the modern fore and aft tiller.|$|E
40|$|Growing cost {{reduction}} trends in machining applications {{has led to}} a significant increase of cutting speeds and process temperatures. In this way, oxidation and diffusion mechanisms in the contact area between chip and tool become substantial, affecting the tool performance. In this paper, diffusion and oxidation interactions at 800 °C among various PVD coated cemented carbide inserts, hardened steel counterparts and low oxygen atmosphere will be introduced. The experiments were conducted under adjustable ambient conditions by a device, developed for this purpose. The coated specimens were <b>fastened</b> <b>inside</b> an electrical heating unit in a controlled gas atmosphere, allowing their contact with steel specimens at a desired pressure and temperature. During the experiments, periodic intervals of the applied pressure were followed by brief non-contact pauses, to avoid any permanent welding between coating and counterpart. For providing insight on the effect of diffusion and oxi dation on the films' chemical composition and mechanical properties, coatings' cross sections in the film contact area were investigated by EDX-line scanning. The results show a considerable deterioration of the films' mechanical properties, which can be attributed more to coatings' oxidation and less to diffusion...|$|E
40|$|Ultra high {{temperature}} ceramic based Zirconium composite “Wedge” was fabricated with suitable dimensions required for high speed combustor using centrifugal thermit process. The wedges are normally {{used in the}} application of the ‘flame holding’ and ‘fuel injection’ of the combustor. The basic requirement of the wedge is that it has to have a very high thermal shock resistance along with near erosion free control surface in un-cooled conditions. Also it has to withstand ultra {{high temperature}}s of the order of 2000 K under extreme heat flux of 10 MW/m 2 and high velocity of gas injection. Wedge shaped strut was machined with special techniques to get the required shape. It was <b>fastened</b> <b>inside</b> the water cooled rectangular duct using tungsten carbide dowel pins. The wedge was tested at the High Speed Combustor Test Facility (HSCTF), with the air flow conditions of 5 bar pressure and with an average temperature of 1900 K. The flow velocity was at Mach number 2 for the duration of 20 seconds. Experiments were repeated many times with the same inlet flow conditions. Thermal shock conditions were created by abruptly bringing down the flow temperature from 1900 K to 300 K with in short duration of 5 seconds. The strut was intact even after several repeated tests except for oxidation coating. The mechanical properties and microstructure characteristics of fuel strut specimens after the combustor test have been investigated and compared with just fabricated material before the test. X-ray radiography also corroborates the flaw less condition of the strut. These results have been discussed in light of the integrity and surface micro structure mechanisms involved in the evaluation process...|$|E

He was still sober enough to be subdued, almost cowed, by resistance of a description unlike all he had ever seen; his alarm at Christina's superior power returned in full force, he staggered to the stairs, Christina rushed after him, closed the heavy door with all her force, <b>fastened</b> it <b>inside,</b> and would have sunk down to weep but for Ermentrude's peevish wail of distress.|$|R
40|$|A {{model is}} {{proposed}} {{to study the}} dynamic response of cargo like pendulum vibration under three dimension vehicle hull motions. A nonlinear two degree-of-freedom model of the cargo inside vehicle hull is developed and analyzed. Equations of pendulum motion are obtained by first order Lagrange equations using Lagrange multiplier for constrained system with one constraint equation. One or two independent bumpers of the securing cargo are considered in the model. In model of two bumpers between them is right angle. Bumpers forces are represented by a special stiffness and damping {{as a function of}} the displacement and motion velocity. Investigation was made for three kinds of pendulum motion: transient motion from free initial conditions without hull vibrations; stationary motion exciting from constrained string or hull bumpers vibrations; jointly transient and exciting motion. The investigation was made for one, two and tree component harmonica motion of hull. Additional investigation of motion with random excitation was observed. From mathematical modeling the optimization of geometric parameters like length of string and gap between bumpers and pendulum was made. It is found out that processes of transient motion are very short when gap is 'negative'. In additional is found out that by special harmonica frequency start vibro shock motion with large amplitude. Recommendation of investigation may be used for cargo <b>fasten</b> <b>inside</b> trailer, ship or airplane...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{studies were}} {{performed}} to understand the explosive response of composite panels when exposed to near-field explosive loading in different environments. The panel construction under consideration was an E-glass fiber-reinforced composite laminate infused with vinyl ester resin (Derakane 8084). The panel was layered bi-axially with plain-woven fiber orientations at 0 ° and 90 °. Panel dimensions were approximately 203 mm × 203 mm × 1 mm (8 in × 8 in × 0. 04 in). Experiments were carried out with the panel fully clamped in a holding fixture, which was in turn <b>fastened</b> <b>inside</b> a water tank. The fixture was fastened {{in such a way}} as to allow for explosive loading experiments in the following environments: water submersion with water backing, water submersion with air backing, and air immersion with air backing. Experiments were performed in room temperature conditions, and additional experiments in the submerged environments were also performed at high and low water temperatures of 40 °C and 0 °C, respectively. A stereo Digital Image Correlation (DIC) system was employed to capture the full-field dynamic behavior of the panel during the explosive event. Results indicated that the immersion environment contributes significantly to the blast response of the material and to the specimens’ appreciable damage characteristics. The water submersion with air backing environment was found to encourage the greatest panel center point deflection and the most significant damage mechanisms around the boundary. The air immersion with air backing environment was found to encourage less center point deflection and exhibited significant impact damage from the explosive capsule. The water submersion with water backing environment encouraged the least panel deflection and minimal interlaminate damage around the panel boundary and center. Water temperature was found to influence the panel center point deflection, but not damage mechanisms. Maximum positive center point deflections associated with the high and room temperature water submersion with air backing environments, while statistically similar to each other, were found to be statistically different from those associated with the low temperature environment. ...|$|E

60|$|It was {{the front}} bedroom, over the drawing-room. The first glance round {{showed it to}} be {{scrupulously}} clean, and solidly and tastelessly furnished. The hideous paper on the walls, the hideous carpet on the floor, were both of the best quality. The great heavy mahogany bedstead, with its curtains hanging from a hook in the ceiling, and with its clumsily carved head and foot on the same level, offered to the view the anomalous spectacle of French design overwhelmed by English execution. The most noticeable thing {{in the room was}} the extraordinary attention which had been given to the defense of the door. Besides the usual lock and key, it possessed two solid bolts, <b>fastening</b> <b>inside</b> at the top and the bottom. It had been one among the many eccentric sides of Reuben Limbrick's character to live in perpetual dread of thieves breaking into his cottage at night. All the outer doors and all the window shutters were solidly sheathed with iron, and had alarm-bells attached to them on a new principle. Every one of the bedrooms possessed its two bolts on the inner side of the door. And, to crown all, {{on the roof of the}} cottage was a little belfry, containing a bell large enough to make itself heard at the Fulham police station. In Reuben Limbrick's time the rope had communicated with his bedroom. It hung now against the wall, in the passage outside.|$|R

60|$|Desirous {{that my wife}} {{should have}} the {{advantage}} of negative gravity while taking our walks, I had removed the machine from the trunk and <b>fastened</b> it <b>inside</b> of the basket, which she could carry under her arm. This assisted her wonderfully. When one arm was tired she put the basket under the other, and thus, with one hand on my arm, she could easily keep up with the free and buoyant steps my knapsack enabled me to take. She did not object to long tramps here, because nobody knew that she was not a walker, and she always carried some wine or other refreshment in the basket, not only because it was pleasant to have it with us, but because it seemed ridiculous to go about carrying an empty basket.|$|R
