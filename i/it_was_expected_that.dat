5|$|On December 19, 2013, {{the state}} Duma {{approved}} a general amnesty for various prisoners; {{among those who}} qualified for amnesty were those in prison for non-violent offences and mothers of young children. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina would be among those who were released. Their release was confirmed on December 23, 2013.|$|E
5|$|When built, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> the {{reservoir}} would supply water for municipal {{use in the}} Amman region. However, the current levels of pollution in the lake make the water unfit for human consumption, and it is used for irrigation only.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{aircraft}} {{industry as a}} whole was becoming increasingly interested in VTOL aircraft. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> any future European war would start with a nuclear exchange that would destroy most airbases, so aircraft would need to operate from limited airbases, roads or even unprepared fields. Considerable research effort was put into various solutions to securing a second-strike capability. Some of these solutions included rocket-launched aircraft like the zero-length launch concept, while many companies started work on VTOL aircraft as a more appropriate long-term solution.|$|E

5|$|At these speeds, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> the B-70 {{would be}} almost immune to {{interceptor}} aircraft, the only effective weapon against bomber aircraft at the time. The bomber would spend {{only a few minutes}} over a particular radar station, flying out of its range before the controllers could position their fighters in a suitable location for an interception. High speed also made the aircraft difficult to see on radar displays and its high-altitude flight could not be matched by any contemporary Soviet fighter.|$|E
5|$|Despite the controversy, {{the first}} E85 {{flexible}} fuel vehicles {{were introduced in}} November 2008. The first two models available in the Thai market were the Volvo S80 and the C30. The S80 is manufactured locally and the C30 is imported. By {{the time of the}} introduction of flex vehicles there were already two gas stations with E85 fuel available. During 2009 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> 15 fueling stations in Bangkok will have E85 fuel available. In October 2009 the Mitsubishi Lancer Ex was launched becoming the first mass-production E85 flexi-fuel vehicle produced in Thailand.|$|E
5|$|During the 1997 college {{football}} season, the Gator Bowl selection committee held contracts {{with both the}} Big East and Atlantic Coast Conferences. In exchange for guaranteeing to pay a total of $3.2 million to the participating teams, the committee held the right to the second pick of bowl-eligible teams from each conference. Each conference's champion was awarded an automatic spot in a Bowl Alliance game, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> the Gator Bowl would select each conference's second-place team unless other circumstances arose.|$|E

5|$|Early in 1925, a {{foundation}} pile and some tents {{could be found}} {{at the site of the}} future bridge. Men in the region were also awaiting employment on the structure, and by the middle of the year unemployment problems were becoming a serious issue. Similarly government debt was increasing, although it was still expected the railway line to Abbotsford Bridge would be completed. In November, construction started and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> the bridge would be opened around 25 September the following year.|$|E
5|$|Education of {{the young}} was never {{considered}} to be the primary domain of schools, even after they had become more common. Most education was carried out by a child's parents or foster parents. Formal apprenticeships were not the norm in Plymouth; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> a foster family would teach the children whatever trades they themselves practiced. The church also {{played a central role in}} a child's education. As noted above, the primary purpose of teaching children to read was so that they could read the Bible for themselves.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, {{the first}} year of pipelaying, Alyeska set a goal of {{completing}} 45 percent of the 800-mile route. This would not be laid in a straight line, since <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> river crossings would take longer to complete than portions of the pipeline on dry land. Work on the pumping stations and the Valdez Marine Terminal, which had begun in the fall of 1974, also was expected to take longer than laying pipe. Conversely, work on those two projects could proceed during the winter, when pipelaying could not take place due to the frozen ground.|$|E

5|$|Legislation {{passed by}} the Massachusetts {{legislature}} in 1933 {{made it easier for}} police officers who had been off the force {{for more than a year}} to apply for reinstatement. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> this would lead to an effort by the former strikers to be rehired, but several subsequent appeals for reinstatement were denied. In 1937, Massachusetts Governor Charles F. Hurley, after meeting with some of the 1919 strikers, backed the decision of Police Commissioner Joseph Timilty not to reinstate them.|$|E
5|$|On 17 August 2002, he {{collided}} badly with Grimsby Town forward Steve Livingstone {{and knocked}} Livingstone unconscious; this left Livingstone with a skull fracture injury that {{would see him}} out of action for two months. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> Higginbotham would eventually move unless Derby did well enough to gain promotion back to the Premier League, and so in January 2003, with Derby struggling in the First Division, he moved to Southampton on loan, joining permanently in February.|$|E
5|$|René Pottier, {{the winner}} of the 1906 Tour de France, did not defend his title because he had {{committed}} suicide in early 1907. Although the riders officially rode the Tour as individuals, some shared the same sponsor and cooperated as if they rode in teams. At the start of the race, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> the riders sponsored by Alcyon and the riders sponsored by Peugeot would compete for the overall victory. Alcyon started with three main contenders: Louis Trousselier, Marcel Cadolle and Léon Georget; Peugeot counted on Emile Georget.|$|E

40|$|Introduction A {{method is}} {{described}} to jointly estimate source and head parameters in a simultaneous MEG and EEG analysis. This simultaneous analysis {{would be very}} beneficial if <b>it</b> can <b>be</b> shown that <b>it</b> profits from the advantages of both modalities [e. g. 1]. First, the highest spatial gradients, and thus the preferred directions, differ between MEG and EEG. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> both directions <b>are</b> precise in a simultaneous analysis. Second, deep sources hardly generate a MEG signal. Therefore source precision deteriorates fast with depth. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> this disadvantage <b>is</b> countered in a simultaneous analysis. Third, the precision of superficial sources is higher for MEG than for EEG. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> a simultaneous analysis profits from this advantage. Fourth, the radial component of a dipole cannot be estimated from MEG. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> this component can be estimated reliably in a simultaneous analysis. Fifth, EEG requires accurate information concerning the radii and...|$|R

5|$|The hospital's {{design was}} criticised for not {{providing}} {{space for the}} storage of medical files. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> all files would be stored electronically within five years. In the meantime, the paper medical files were transferred {{to the site of}} the old Falkirk Royal Infirmary. An old X-ray department at the hospital was decontaminated and converted into a storage department at a cost of £40,000, and a taxi company was contracted to move the records between sites.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} Causeway {{had carried}} electric trams, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> the new Causeway would also carry trams, or perhaps trolleybuses instead. However, the proposed overhead wires were deemed too ugly {{for the new}} bridge, and between £30,000 and £40,000 could be saved by using buses instead. The routes using the Causeway were replaced with bus services, but the bridges as constructed were nonetheless designed {{to be able to}} carry trams.|$|E

5|$|To {{address this}} concern, a {{considerable}} amount of LIFE's effort was put into the development of simplified target designs and automated construction that would lower their cost. Working with General Atomics, the LIFE team developed a concept using on-site fuel factories that would mass-produce pellets {{at a rate of about}} a million a day. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> this would reduce their price to about 25 cents per target, although other references suggest the target price was closer to 50 cents, and LLNL's own estimates range from 20 to 30 cents.|$|E
5|$|After an {{exhibition}} rout of US Armed Forces, the Lady Vols {{opened up the}} season unusually, with a conference game against Mississippi. Semeka Randall did not start the game. However, four minutes into the game, the Lady Vols were only up 4–2. At this point, Randall was put into the game, and Tennessee scored fifteen straight, on a run fueled by her. Randall scored 24, and star Chamique Holdsclaw added 23. This season opener has {{caused a lot of}} anticipation, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> this would be the game where all four of Tennessee's freshman played together. However, during a November practice, Clement had injured her foot, resulting in a stress fracture. After a discussion with the team doctor, Clement agreed to sit out the Mississippi game {{in order to be able}} to play the next game, against Louisiana Tech.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{documentary}} {{account of}} Gibraltar {{is available for}} the period following the Madinat al-Fath project, {{there are reasons to}} believe that a small fortified town existed in Gibraltar, and that its existence was the direct consequence of the fall of Tarifa in 1292. After the capture of the city, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> Sancho would lay siege to Algeciras (it did not eventually happen) in order to sever the most direct links of the Marinids with the Iberian peninsula. The threatening presence of a Christian stronghold to the west would have led to the establishment of a garrison to the east of Algeciras. That way, Gibraltar would have protected the rearguard of Algeciras and provide a fallback position should Algeciras have fallen. At the same time, and with the increased presence of the Christian fleets in the Straits, Gibraltar provided an excellent lookout post.|$|E
