40|$|SummaryEfficacy and {{tolerability}} of tiagabine {{was evaluated}} {{in patients with}} non-controlled partial seizures in a multicentre, open-label, parallel group study. Tiagabine was administered either two (b. <b>i.</b> <b>d.)</b> or three times daily (t. <b>i.</b> <b>d.)</b> as adjunctive therapy and titrated stepwise to a target of 40 mg/day during a 12 -week, fixed-schedule titration period; {{this was followed by}} a 12 -week flexible continuation period. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients completing the fixed-schedule titration period. A total of 243 patients were randomised and received treatment, 123 to b. <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> and 120 to t. <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> dosing. Fewer patients in the b. <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> (76 and 62 %) than in the t. <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> (87 and 72 %) group completed the fixed-schedule titration period (OR: 0. 562; 95 % CI: 0. 309 – 1. 008; P= 0. 0532). The median percentage decrease in all types of seizure (excluding status epilepticus) during the fixed schedule titration period was 33. 4 % for the b. <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> and 23. 8 % for the t. <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> groups (P= 0. 9634; Van Elteren's test). The proportion of responders was similar for the b. <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> and t. <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> groups. There {{were no significant differences between}} dosage regimens in the change in median seizure rates from baseline. Adverse events were more frequent during the titration than the continuation period. Most events were mild and related to the central nervous system. Although their incidence was similar between treatment groups, severity was more frequent in the b. <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> group. Our results suggest that during titration tiagabine is better tolerated with t. <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> dosing, but during long-term maintenance, a t. <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> schedule is as effective and well tolerated as b. <b>i.</b> <b>d...</b>|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} whether increasing bosentan dosing frequency from 2 [*]mg/kg twice daily (b. <b>i.</b> <b>d.)</b> to 2 [*]mg/kg three times daily (t. <b>i.</b> <b>d.)</b> {{in children with}} pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (from ≥ 3 [*]months to < 12 [*]years of age) would increase exposure. METHODS: An open-label, prospective, randomised, multicentre, multiple-dose, Phase 3 study was conducted. Patients (n[*]=[*] 64) were randomised 1 : 1 to receive oral doses of bosentan of 2 [*]mg/kg b. <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> or t. <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> The main pharmacokinetic endpoint was the daily exposure to bosentan over 24 [*]h corrected to the 2 [*]mg/kg dose (AUC 0 - 24 C). CmaxC, tmax and safety endpoints were also assessed. RESULTS: The geometric mean (95 % CI) for AUC 0 - 24 C was 8535 [*]h. ng/mL (6936 - 10504) and 7275 [*]h. ng/mL (5468 - 9679) for 2 [*]mg/kg b. <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> and t. <b>i.</b> <b>d.,</b> respectively (geometric mean ratio [95 % CI]: 0. 85 [0. 61 - 1. 20]). The geometric mean (95 % CI) for CmaxC was 743 [*]ng/mL (573 - 963) and 528 [*]ng/mL (386 - 722) for 2 [*]mg/kg b. <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> and t. <b>i.</b> <b>d.,</b> respectively (geometric mean ratio [95 % CI]: 0. 71 [0. 48 - 1. 05]). The median (range) for tmax was 3. 0 [*]h (0. 0 - 7. 5) and 3. 0 [*]h (1. 0 - 8. 0) for 2 [*]mg/kg b. <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> and t. <b>i.</b> <b>d.,</b> respectively. The proportions of patients who experienced ≥ 1 adverse event were similar in the b. <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> (66. 7 %) and t. <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> (67. 7 %) groups. CONCLUSIONS: There appeared to be no clinically relevant difference in exposure to bosentan, and in safety, when increasing the frequency of bosentan dosing from b. <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> to t. <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> Therefore, this study provides no indication that the dosing recommendation should be changed and 2 [*]mg/kg b. <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> remains the recommended dosing regimen of bosentan for paediatric PAH patients...|$|R

Thus, the short-term (i. e., 10 -day) <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> LD 50 of nu/nu mice was less than 7 x 10 (0). The short-term survival of <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> infection was dependent on tumor necrosis factor and gamma interferon: treatment of nu/nu mice with anti-tumor necrosis factor or anti-gamma interferon {{at the time of}} <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> infection resulted in death from infection 7 to 8 days later, whereas control infected nu/nu mice survived for 26 days. nu/nu mice infected with LVS <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> generated LVS-specific serum antibodies, which were predominantly immunoglobulin M: titers peaked 7 days after <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> infection but declined sharply by day 21, after which mice died.

40|$|Objectives: A multicenter {{double-blind}} placebo-controlled {{clinical study}} was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of two different therapeutic schedules of mesalazine suppositories in patients with ulcerative proctitis. Methods: From 1990 to 1993, 111 patients with ulcerative proctisis in remission, limited to the rectum (less than or equal to 15 cm from anus), were enrolled. After obtaining informed consent, patients were randomized to three treatment groups: 500 mg mesalazine b. <b>i.</b> <b>d</b> (36 patients), 500 mg mesalazine u. <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> (40 patients), and placebo (35 patients). The treatment lasted 1 yr. Follow-up consisted of periodic clinical, endoscopic, and histological assessments. An endoscopic score > 1 according to the Baron scale defined relapse occurence. The three groups were homogeneous as regards main demographic, diagnostic, and prognostic features. Results: The cumulative relapse rates at 12 months were 10 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0 - 21) in the mesalazine b. <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> group, 32 % (95 % CI: 16 - 49) in the mesalazine u. <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> group, and 47 % (95 % CI: 29 - 65) in the placebo group. The comparison between the mesalazine b. <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> group and the mesalazine u. <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> group cumulative relapse rates gave a p value of 0. 0334, whereas the corresponding comparison between the mesalazine b. <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> group and the placebo group gave a p value of 0. 007 (log-rank test). The dose-response relationship was statistically significant (p = 0. 008 by Cox analysis). Two patients in the mesalazine b. <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> group, two patients in the mesalazine u. <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> group, and one patient in the placebo group withdrew from the study due to nonserious adverse events; four, three, and four patients per group, respectively, dropped out because of poor compliance.

RESULTS — Study 1 : PK and PD were markedly different between BIAsp 30 OD and BHI 30 OD: the maximum insulin concentration and glucose infusion rate (GIR) were higher for BIAsp 30; time to maximum metabolism was 1. 7 h sooner for BIAsp 30. Study 2 : both regimens showed three distinct prandial-related GIR peaks. GIR 24 -h area under the curve for BIAsp t. <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> was higher than for basal-bolus therapy: 2, 585. 2 vs. 2, 289. 2 mg/kg. CONCLUSIONS — BIAsp had pharmacological advantages over BHI. BIAsp t. <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> had a similar PD profile to basal-bolus therapy. Premixed insulin analogs are a commonly prescribed first insulin therapy for type 2 diabetic patients and may be a simpler alternative to basalbolus therapy (1, 2). Compared with biphasic human insulin 30 / 70 (BHI 30), the modern premixed insulin analog, biphasic insulin aspart 30 / 70 (BIAsp 30) has pharmacokinetics (PK) that more closely match endogenous insulin secretion (3, 4). Therefore, an initial once-daily (OD) BIAsp 30 regimen can be safely intensified to twice-daily (b. <b>i.</b> <b>d.)</b> or threetimes-daily (t. <b>i.</b> <b>d.)</b> injections (5). To compare the PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) {{profiles of}} these different regimens, two crossover glucose clamp studies were Diabetes Care 32 : 1431 – 1433, 2009 carried out in insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes.

Results were evaluated by Per Protocol (PP) and Intention-To-Treat analysis (ITT). Eradication rate was 100 % after treatment A, 92. 6 % after treatment B and 86. 5 % after treatment C by PP and 83. 3, 75. 7, and 68. 1 %, respectively by ITT. Side effects were reported by 16 subjects: 26. 6 % in group A; 9. 1 % in group B; and 7. 5 % in group C; in two cases side effects led to the withdrawal of the treatment. In conclusion, 500 mg clarithromycin per day in association with omeprazole and metronidazole, for 1 week gave comparable results to the same schedule for a 2 week period. The use of clarithromycin with bismuth and metronidazole produced a therapeutic gain compared with both of the anti-secretory schedules, although this was not statistically significant...|$|R

First, the procedure of obtaining confidence intervals using regular nonparametric <b>i.</b> <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> bootstrap is specified. Empirical evidence seems to invalidate this approach as it indicates strong autocorrelation and cross correlation in the residuals. A more general approach is introduced, relying on the Sieve bootstrap method, that includes the nonparametric <b>i.</b> <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> method as a special case. Secondly, this paper examines {{the performance of the}} nonparametric <b>i.</b> <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> and the Sieve bootstrap approach. In an application to a Dutch data set, the Sieve bootstrap method returns much wider confidence intervals compared to the nonparametric <b>i.</b> <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> approach. Neglecting the residuals' dependency structure, the nonparametric <b>i.</b> <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> bootstrap method seems to construct confidence intervals that are too narrow.

MethodsThe cohort comprised of eight groups containing 18 (9 male and 9 female) rabbits in each group. Group I remained non-immunized and received only vehicle (sterile distilled water, 1 mL/kg × b. <b>i.</b> <b>d.)</b> intramuscularly. Group II received vehicle (1 mL/kg × b. <b>i.</b> <b>d.)</b> while Groups III-VII (drugs-treated) received subcutaneous histamine (100 μg/kg × b. <b>i.</b> <b>d.),</b> and intramuscular H 1 R-antagonist (pheniramine, 10 mg/kg × b. <b>i.</b> <b>d.),</b> H 2 R-antagonist (ranitidine, 10 mg/kg × b. <b>i.</b> <b>d.),</b> H 3 R-antagonist (iodophenpropit, 1 μg/kg × b. <b>i.</b> <b>d.)</b> and H 4 R-antagonist (JNJ 7777120, 10 μg/kg × b. <b>i.</b> <b>d.),</b> and Group VIII DMSO (1 mL/kg × b. <b>i.</b> <b>d.),</b> respectively for 10 days (starting from day 1). They were subsequently immunized with intravenous injection of sheep {{red blood cells}} (SRBC) at day 3. The estimation of serum Igs, IgM and IgG were done by ELISA, and observed at day 0 (pre-immunization), and 7, 14, 21, 28 and 58 (post-immunization). ResultsIt was shown that histamine and HRs-antagonists could influence a detectable antibody response to SRBC as early as day 7 -post-immunization (post-I), which lasted until day 58 post-I. The results were found statistically significant (P< 0. 05).

Two and three <b>i.</b> <b>d.</b> EP immunizations induced immune responses of similar magnitude, and a short interval between immunizations was superior to a longer interval in terms of the magnitude of cellular immune responses. The FluoroSpot assay allowed for the quantification of vaccine-specific cells secreting either gamma interferon (IFN-γ), interleukin- 2 (IL- 2), or both, and the sensitivity of the assay was confirmed with IFN-γ and IL- 2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assays.
