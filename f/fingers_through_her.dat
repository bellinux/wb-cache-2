500|$|In February 1992, Al Rendon {{was hired}} by EMI Latin to take {{photographs}} for Entre a Mi Mundo. A previous photographer had taken some photos of the singer, which were not well received by the company, and Rendon was asked to do a [...] "quick session". Rendon rented a studio and hired John MacBurney—whom Abraham constany argued with—to do the makeup. MacBurney [...] "privately complained" [...] to EMI Latin that Abraham was difficult to deal with. Rendon and MacBurney, however, found Selena [...] "real easy to work with". Selena picked out the outfit for herself to wear in the cover picture; this outfit included a black top with a mesh see-through midriff, a long-sleeve black jacket with black-and-white striped long sleeves, a wide black leather belt, and tight black pants. She chose a pose where she runs her <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>her</b> hair, a pose that Abraham was noticeably bothered with. In 1998, the outfit that she wore for the album cover was added to a museum that her family operates in Corpus Christi, Texas.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, don't mention it, monsieur; {{you only}} touched my hair with your elbow; {{it is no}} worse, only a little dishevelled." [...] She shook it back, and passing her <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>her</b> curls, {{loosened}} them into more numerous and flowing ringlets. Then she went on with vivacity: ...|$|E

"I'm sure I don't {{know what}} to say," [...] replied Mrs Brand, {{with a look of}} deep anxiety, as she passed her <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>her</b> son's hair, and kissed his brow. [...] "I have seen the {{innocent}} condemned and the guilty go free more than once in my life." ...|$|E
5000|$|Tamako is {{a natural}} wrestler with {{incredible}} moves. However, she is very clumsy and often injures herself. She is absent minded often forgetting the names of people she just met, {{where she was going}} and what she was doing. A running throughout the (both) series is that her opponents frequently defeat Tamako, often by exploiting her [...] "Achilles' Heel" [...] kancho, which is by stuffing a <b>finger</b> <b>through</b> <b>her</b> nether regions (her anus or rectum) to trump her in any match. She has a never ending quest for Pocari for Higuchi. She is the heroine of the story and is ogled over by male and female characters in the story.|$|R
50|$|Time passed, and Shakuntala, {{wondering}} why Dushyanta {{did not return}} for her, finally {{set out for the}} capital city with her foster father and some of her companions. On the way, they had to cross a river by a canoe ferry and, seduced by the deep blue waters of the river, Shakuntala ran <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> the water. <b>Her</b> ring (Dushyanta's ring) slipped off her finger without her realizing it.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Peagrim {{wrinkled}} her fair forehead. It has been truly {{said that there}} is no agony like the agony of literary composition, and Mrs. Peagrim was having rather a bad time getting the requisite snap and ginger into her latest communication to the Press. She bit her lip, and would have passed <b>her</b> twitching <b>fingers</b> restlessly <b>through</b> <b>her</b> hair but for the thought of the damage which such an action must do to her coiffure. Miss Frisby, her secretary, an anæmic and negative young woman, waited patiently, pad on knee, and tapped her teeth with her pencil.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{quite right}} {{that they should}} poach," [...] said Mary, {{watching}} him tugging at the wire. [...] "I wonder whether it was Alfred Duggins or Sid Rankin? How can one expect them not to, when they only make fifteen shillings a week? Fifteen shillings a week," [...] she repeated, coming out {{on the other side}} of the hedge, and running her <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>her</b> hair to rid herself of a bramble which had attached itself to her. [...] "I could live on fifteen shillings a week--easily." ...|$|E
6000|$|Dr. J. Crichton Browne {{has given}} me so {{striking}} an account of intense fear in an insane woman, aged thirty-five, that the description though painful {{ought not to be}} omitted. When a paroxysm seizes her, she screams out, [...] "This is hell!" [...] "There is a black woman!" [...] "I can't get out!"--and other such exclamations. When thus screaming, her movements are those of alternate tension and tremor. For one instant she clenches her hands, holds her arms out before her in a stiff semi-flexed position; then suddenly bends her body forwards, sways rapidly to and fro, draws her <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>her</b> hair, clutches at her neck, and tries to tear off her clothes. The sterno-cleido-mastoid muscles (which serve to bend the head on the chest) stand out prominently, as if swollen, and the skin in front of them is much wrinkled. Her hair, which is cut short {{at the back of her}} head, and is smooth when she is calm, now stands on end; that in front being dishevelled by the movements of her hands. The countenance expresses great mental agony. The skin is flushed over the face and neck, down to the clavicles, and the veins of the forehead and neck stand out like thick cords. The lower lip drops, and is somewhat everted. The mouth is kept half open, with the lower jaw projecting. The cheeks are hollow and deeply furrowed in curved lines running from the wings of the nostrils to the corners of the mouth. The nostrils themselves are raised and extended. The eyes are widely opened, and beneath them the skin appears swollen; the pupils are large. The forehead is wrinkled transversely in many folds, and at the inner extremities of the eyebrows it is strongly furrowed in diverging lines, produced by the powerful and persistent contraction of the corrugators.|$|E
6000|$|Mary had a ruffled appearance, {{as if she}} {{had been}} running her <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>her</b> hair in the course of her conversation; she was dressed more or less like a Russian peasant girl. She sat down again in a chair which looked as if it had been her seat for some hours; the saucer which stood upon the arm {{contained}} the ashes of many cigarettes. Mr. Basnett, a very young man with a fresh complexion and a high forehead from which the hair was combed straight back, was one of that group of [...] "very able young men" [...] suspected by Mr. Clacton, justly as it turned out, of an influence upon Mary Datchet. He had come down from one of the Universities not long ago, and was now charged with the reformation of society. In connection with the rest of the group of very able young men he had drawn up a scheme for the education of labor, for the amalgamation of the middle class and the working class, and for a joint assault of the two bodies, combined in the Society for the Education of Democracy, upon Capital. The scheme had already reached the stage in which it was permissible to hire an office and engage a secretary, and he had been deputed to expound the scheme to Mary, and make her an offer of the Secretaryship, to which, as a matter of principle, a small salary was attached. Since seven o'clock that evening he had been reading out loud the document in which the faith of the new reformers was expounded, but the reading was so frequently interrupted by discussion, and it was so often necessary to inform Mary [...] "in strictest confidence" [...] of the private characters and evil designs of certain individuals and societies that they were still only half-way through the manuscript. Neither of them realized that the talk had already lasted three hours. In their absorption they had forgotten even to feed the fire, and yet both Mr. Basnett in his exposition, and Mary in her interrogation, carefully preserved a kind of formality calculated to check the desire of the human mind for irrelevant discussion. Her questions frequently began, [...] "Am I to understand--" [...] and his replies invariably represented the views of some one called [...] "we." ...|$|E
6000|$|There {{was a wild}} {{light in}} her eye, and her {{straight}} hair was out demonstrating and suffragetting upon some independent notions of its own. <b>Her</b> <b>fingers</b> were bursting <b>through</b> <b>her</b> gloves, as if to get at once into touch with Ann Veronica. [...] "You're Glorious!" [...] said Miss Miniver in tones of rapture, holding a hand in each of hers and peering up into Ann Veronica's face. [...] "Glorious! You're so calm, dear, and so resolute, so serene! ...|$|R
60|$|Barker was astounded, dismayed, even terror-stricken. Mrs. Horncastle crying! Mrs. Horncastle, the imperious, the collected, the coldly critical, the cynical, smiling {{woman of}} the world, {{actually}} crying! Other women might cry--Kitty had cried often--but Mrs. Horncastle! Yet, there she was, sobbing; actually sobbing like a schoolgirl, her beautiful shoulders rising and falling with her grief; crying unmistakably <b>through</b> <b>her</b> long white <b>fingers,</b> <b>through</b> a lace pocket-handkerchief which she had hurriedly produced and shaken from behind her like a conjurer's trick; her beautiful eyes a thousand times more lustrous for the sparkling beads that brimmed her lashes and welled over like the pool before her.|$|R

60|$|Phineas had {{declared}} at Killaloe that Lady Laura was six feet high, {{that she had}} red hair, that her figure was straggling, and that her hands and feet were large. She was in fact about five feet seven in height, and she carried her height well. There was something of nobility in her gait, and she seemed thus to be taller than her inches. Her hair was in truth red,--of a deep thorough redness. Her brother's hair was the same; and so had been that of her father, before it had become sandy with age. Her sister's had been of a soft auburn hue, and hers had been {{said to be the}} prettiest head of hair in Europe {{at the time of her}} marriage. But in these days we have got to like red hair, and Lady Laura's was not supposed to stand in the way of her being considered a beauty. Her face was very fair, though it lacked that softness which we all love in women. Her eyes, which were large and bright, and very clear, never seemed to quail, never rose and sunk or showed themselves to be afraid of their own power. Indeed, Lady Laura Standish had nothing of fear about her. Her nose was perfectly cut, but was rather large, having the slightest possible tendency to be aquiline. Her mouth also was large, but was full of expression, and her teeth were perfect. Her complexion was very bright, but in spite of its brightness she never blushed. The shades of her complexion were set and steady. Those who knew her said that her heart was so fully under command that nothing could stir her blood to any sudden motion. As to that accusation of straggling which had been made against her, it had sprung from ill-natured observation of her modes of sitting. She never straggled when she stood or walked; but she would lean forward when sitting, as a man does, and would use her arms in talking, and would put her hand over her face, and pass her <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>her</b> hair,--after the fashion of men rather than of women;--and she seemed to despise that soft quiescence of her sex in which are generally found so many charms. Her hands and feet were large,--as was her whole frame. Such was Lady Laura Standish; and Phineas Finn had been untrue to himself and to his own appreciation of the lady when he had described her in disparaging terms to Mary Flood Jones. But, though he had spoken of Lady Laura in disparaging terms, he had so spoken of her as to make Miss Flood Jones quite understand that he thought a great deal about Lady Laura.|$|E

50|$|The {{only people}} who can calm her down are the shamans. Now and then, they dive {{down to the bottom}} of the sea. They run their <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>her</b> hair and make it all neat and tidy. They free the animals. They soothe her and settle her down and the sea becomes calm and smooth again. There are seals, walruses, fish, and whales again. People can go out to hunt and have food to eat.|$|E

50|$|Nuliajuk {{lives in}} the ocean {{for a very long}} time. Nuliajuk just sits on the ocean floor, her long hair flowing, moving back and forth with the tides and the currents. When you look down into the sea over the side of a boat in summer, you can see her hair, swaying back and forth. Sometimes as her hair moves with the water, it gets all disheveled and tangled up. The creatures of the sea get caught in it and no matter how hard they try they cannot get out. It would be so nice if Nuliajuk can run her <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>her</b> hair and let all these animals out, but Nuliajuk has no fingers.|$|E
