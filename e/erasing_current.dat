40|$|Abstract—For {{the first}} time, we can {{directly}} investigate the charge transport and intra-nitride behaviors of SONOS-type devices by exploiting the gate-sensing and channel-sensing (GSCS) method. Our results clearly indicate that for electron injection (+FN program), the electron centroid migrates {{from the bottom}} toward the nitride center, whereas for hole injection (−FN erase), holes first recombine with the bottom electrons and then gradually move upward. For the electron de-trapping processes under−VG stressing, the trapped electrons de-trap first from the bottom portion of nitride. We also develop a method to distinguish the electron de-trapping and hole injection erasing methods by comparing the <b>erasing</b> <b>current</b> density (J) versus the bottom oxide electric field (E). At short-term high-temperature baking, the electrons move from the top portion toward the bottom portion, and this intra-nitride transport becomes more significant for a thicker nitride. On the other hand, after long-term bak-ing, the charge loss mainly comes from the bottom portion of nitride.

Recently there has been a surge of interest to introduce a new generation of memory devices using graphene nanotechnology. In this paper we present a new floating gate transistor (FGT) design based on multilayer graphene nanoribbon (MLGNR) and carbon nanotube (CNT). In the proposed graphene based floating gate transistor (GFGT) a multilayer structure of graphene nanoribbon (GNR) would be used as the channel of the field effect transistor (FET) and a layer of CNTs would be used as the floating gate. We have performed an analysis of the charge accumulation mechanism in the floating gate and its dependence on the applied terminal voltages. Based on our analysis we have observed that proposed graphene based floating gate transistor could be operated at a reduced voltage compared to conventional silicon based floating gate devices. We have presented detail analysis of the operation and the programming and erasing processes of the proposed FGT, dependency of the programming and <b>erasing</b> <b>current</b> density on different parameters, impact of scaling the thicknesses of the control and tunneling oxides. These analyses are done based on the equivalent capacitance model of the device. We have analyze the programming and erasing by the tunneling current mechanism in the proposed graphene-CNT floating gate transistor. In this paper, we have investigated the mechanism of programming current and the factors that would influence this current and the behavior of the proposed floating gate transistor. The analysis reveals that programming is a strong function of the high field induced by the control gate, and the thicknesses of the control oxide and the tunnel oxide. With the growing demand for nonvolatile flash memory devices and increasing limitations of silicon technologies, there has been a growing interest to develop emerging flash memory by using alternative nanotechnology. The proposed FGT device for nonvolatile flash memory contains an MLGNR channel and a CNT floating gate with SiO₂ as the tunnel oxide. In this paper, we have presented detail analysis of the electrical properties and performance characteristics of the proposed FGT device. We have focused on the following aspects: current voltage (I-V) characteristics, threshold voltage variation (∆VTH), programming, erasing and reading power consumptions compared to the existing FGTs, and layer-by-layer current voltage characteristics comparison of the proposed GFGT device. To realize graphene field effect transistor (GFET), a general model is developed, validated and analyzed. This model is also used to estimate graphene channel behavior of the proposed GFGT. Reliability is the major concern of the Flash memory technology. We have analyzed retention characteristics of the proposed GFGT. We also have developed a radiation harness test model for the Si-FGT by using VTH variation principle due to the radiation exposure. Flash memory experiences adverse effects due to radiation. These effects can be raised in terms of doping, feature size, supply voltages, layout, shielding. The operating point shift of the device forced to enter the logically-undefined region and cause upset and data errors under radiation exposure. In this research, the threshold voltage shift of the floating gate transistor (FGT) is analyzed by a mathematical model. Molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2) based field effect transistor is considered as one of the promising future logic devices. Many other nanoelectronic devices based on MoS 2 are currently under investigation. However, the challenge of providing reliable and efficient contact between 2 D materials like MoS 2 and the metal is still unresolved. The contact resistance between metal and MoS 2 limits the application of MoS 2 in current semiconductor technologies. In this paper, a detail analysis of metal-MoS 2 contact has been presented. Specific contributions of this work are:investigation of the physical, material and electrical parameters that would determine the contact properties, analysis of the combined impact of the top and back gates for the first time, modeling of the crucial metal-MoS 2 contact parameters, such as, sheet resistance (RSh), contact resistivity (ρc), contact resistance (RC) and transfer length (LT), investigation of the ways to incorporate the developed contact model into the electronic design automation (EDA) tools and investigation of different contact materials for the metal-MoS 2 contact. The three dimensional integrated circuit (3 D- IC) is expected to extend Moore's law. To reduce interconnects and time delay, semiconductor industry is shifting 2 D-IC to 2. 5 D-IC and 3 D-IC. 3 D-IC is the ultimate goal of the semiconductor industry, where 2. 5 D-IC is an intermediate state. It is important to realize CAD design challenges of the 2. 5 D-IC/ 3 D-IC when minimum spacing interconnects are used. The major contributions of this research work are as follows. Previously, for the small scale experimental purpose, small numbers (10 - 20) of TSVs, interconnects, bumps are fabricated together by hand calculation. However in the real 3 D-IC design, thousands of TSVs, interconnects, bumps are reuired. Therefore, an automated CAD solution is required to provide precise physical design and verification. Therefore, a solid CAD solution is provided here. Compatible with 40 nm-technology design, which enables the Silicon Interposer to integrate with the digital, analog and RF dies together. Dimensions and spacing of the TSV and Bump are optimized by the 3 D EM full wave field solver. To our best knowledge, at the interposer level, this design reports the most dense and well-defined RDL, TSV and micro-bump co-design on Silicon Interposer, which will be used for 2. 5 D-IC.

We use transient analysis {{to transform the}} erase curve (VFB−time) into a J–E curve (J = transient current, E = field in the tunnel oxide) {{in order to understand}} the underlying physics. The measured <b>erase</b> <b>current</b> of MANOS is three orders of magni-tude higher than that can be theoretically provided by substrate hole current. In addition, the <b>erase</b> <b>current</b> is very sensitive to the Al 2 O 3 processing condition—also inconsistent with substrate hole injection model. Thus, we propose that MANOS erase occurs through an electron detrapping mechanism. We have further car-ried out a refill test and its results support the detrapping model.

Such loop prediction challenges, which arise frequently in comparative modeling and protein design, can become intractable as loop lengths exceed 10 residues and if surrounding side-chain conformations are <b>erased.</b> <b>Current</b> approaches, {{such as the}} protein local optimization protocol or kinematic inversion closure (KIC) Monte Carlo, involve stages that coarse-grain proteins, simplifying modeling but precluding a systematic search of all-atom configurations. This article introduces an alternative modeling strategy based on a ‘stepwise ansatz’, recently developed for RNA modeling, which posits that any realistic all-atom molecular conformation can be built up by residue-by-residue stepwise enumeration. When harnessed to a dynamic-programming-like recursion in the Rosetta framework, the resulting stepwise assembly (SWA) protocol enables enumerative sampling of a 12 residue loop at a significant but achievable cost of thousands of CPU-hours. In a previously established benchmark, SWA recovers crystallographic conformations with sub-Angstrom accuracy for 19 of 20 loops, compared to 14 of 20 by KIC modeling with a comparable expenditure of computational power. Furthermore, SWA gives high accuracy results on an additional set of 15 loops highlighted in the biological literature for their irregularity or unusual length. Successes include cis-Pro touch turns, loops that pass through tunnels of other side-chains, and loops of lengths up to 24 residues. Remaining problem cases are traced to inaccuracies i...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} a principle way to progressively mine discriminative object regions using classification networks {{to address the}} weakly-supervised semantic segmentation problems. Classification networks are only responsive to small and sparse discriminative regions from the object of interest, which deviates from the requirement of the segmentation task that needs to localize dense, interior and integral regions for pixel-wise inference. To mitigate this gap, we propose a new adversarial erasing approach for localizing and expanding object regions progressively. Starting with a single small object region, our proposed approach drives the classification network to sequentially discover new and complement object regions by <b>erasing</b> the <b>current</b> mined regions in an adversarial manner. These localized regions eventually constitute a dense and complete object region for learning semantic segmentation.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{interpretation}} of the mean surface density of stellar companions as a function of separation (or the two point correlation function of stars) in star-forming regions. First, we consider the form of the functions for various simple stellar distributions (binaries, global density profiles, clusters, and fractals) and the effects of survey boundaries. Following this, we study the dependencies of the separation at which a transition from the binary to the large-scale clustering regime occurs. Larson (1995) found that the mean surface density of companions follows different power-law functions of separation in the two regimes. He identified the transition separation with the typical Jeans length in the molecular cloud. However, we show that this is valid only for special cases. In general, the transition separation depends on the volume density of stars, the depth of the star-forming region, the volume-filling nature of the stellar distribution, and on the parameters of the binaries. Furthermore, the transition separation evolves with time. We then apply these results to the Taurus-Auriga, Ophiuchus, and Orion Trapezium star-forming regions. We find that while the transition separation in the Taurus-Auriga star-forming region may indicate a typical Jeans length, this is not true of the Orion Trapezium Cluster. We also show that there is no evidence for sub-clustering or fractal structure in the stars of the Orion Trapezium Cluster. This is consistent with the fact that, if such structure were present when the stars formed, it would have been <b>erased</b> by the <b>current</b> age of the cluster due to the stellar velocity dispersion.

40|$|Mainstream {{non-volatile}} memory technology, {{dominated by the}} floating gate transistor, has historically improved in density, performance and cost primarily by means of process scaling. This simple geometrical scaling now faces significant challenges due to constraints of electrostatics and reliability. Thus, novel non-transistor based memory paradigms are being widely explored. Among the various contenders for next generation storage technology, RRAM devices have got immense attention due to their high-speed, multilevel capability, scalability, simple structure, low voltage operation and high endurance. In this thesis, electrical and material characterization is carried out on a MIM device system and formation / annihilation of nanoscale filaments is shown to be the reason behind the resistance switching. The MIM system is optimized to include an in-cell resistor which is shown to improve device endurance and reduce stuck-at-one faults. For highest density, the devices were arranged in a crossbar geometry and vertically integrated on CMOS decoders to demonstrate the feasibility of practical data storage applications. Next, we show that these binary RRAM devices exhibit native stochastic nature of resistive switching. Even for a fixed voltage on the same device, the wait time associated with programming is not fixed and is random and broadly distributed. However, the probability of switching can be predicted and controlled by the programming pulse. These binary devices {{have been used to}} generate random bit-streams with predicable bias ratios in time and space domains. The ability to produce random bit-streams using binary resistive switching devices based on the native stochastic switching principle may potentially lead to novel non-von-Neumann computing paradigms. Further, sub- 1 nA operating current devices have been developed. This ultra-low current provides energy savings by minimizing programming, <b>erase</b> and read <b>currents.</b> Despite having such low currents, excellent retention, on/off ratio and endurance have been demonstrated. Finally a scalable approach to simple 3 D stacking is discussed. By implementation of a vertical sidewall-based architecture, the number of critical lithography steps can be reduced.

This urban asymmetry is a resource of the ETH complex and we will not try (once again) to turn the system into a perfectly symmetric one. We propose not to work against the logic of the existing geography of public spaces surrounding the building and propose to increase the complexity of the system by adding a new type of public space to the existing collection: the Rämi-straße is the place to enter into the building: it is a gate (Tor); it also floats on an underground parking garage: it is a bridge (Brücke). The new space consequently appears as a bridge-gate, an explicitly monumental entrance spanning a multiform logistic underworld. As a gate (Tor), the new open space introduces to the five doors (Türe) of ETH main building and highlights the volume of the rotunda with the insertion of two symmetrical cylindrical volumes at either sides of the bridge. The two vertical elements (a group of poles with flags and an in- formative panel) activate the baroque choreography of the building, engaging the semi-cylindrical volume of the rotunda in a silent rotation. The golden LED text slowly flows along the black cylinder, providing public information about the ETH activities and generating a movement echoed by the oscillations of the flags. The bridge is a succession of triangular beams form- ing a folded surface that helps spanning the 21 to 37 m connecting the rotunda with the street, and determine a mildly corrugated landscape. The total height of the system is about 80 cm. The difference in height among the lowest “valley bottoms” and the highest ridges of this geography is just 20 cm, contributing to the definition of an articulated, yet continuous surface. Such surface adapts to the different heights of the various urban elements at its borders and allows perfect accessibility to all areas, <b>erasing</b> all the <b>current</b> barriers to the circulation of cars, wheelchairs and vehicles...|$|R
30|$|Recently, application-specific instruction-set {{processor}} (ASIP) solutions {{have been}} investigated in order to offer architectures providing good trade-offs in terms of flexibility, throughput and power dissipation. In [14], a flexible and high performance ASIP model for turbo decoding was proposed, which can be configured to support all simple and double binary turbo codes up to eight states. The architecture uses shuffled decoding with frame sub-blocking. The extrinsic information is iteratively and concurrently exchanged between multiple component decoders via an on-chip communication network presented in [15]. Afterwards, an optimized implementation of the ASIP supporting both turbo codes and LDPC codes, called DecASIP have been presented in [16]. Similarly, the authors in [17] introduce the FlexiTreP ASIP presented in [18] in a multi-ASIP architecture for turbo decoding to reach the 150 Mbps throughput requirement of LTE. Previous works provide {{an efficient way to}} reach the high performance requirement of emerging standards. However, the dynamic reconfiguration aspect of these platforms is superficially addressed. In [19], the authors propose a reconfigurable multi-processor approach in order to decode multiple data streams in parallel. However, the timing impact of such a reconfiguration process is not detailed. Among the few works which consider this issue, we can cite the recent architecture presented in [20], where the authors propose solutions for the reconfiguration management of the network-on-chip (NoC) based multi-processor turbo/LDPC decoder architecture presented in [21]. Up to 35 processing elements (PEs) and up to 8 configuration buses have been implemented. Each PE is configured through a configuration memory, which is organized as a circular buffer. The reconfiguration process to switch from one configuration to another configuration can be masked by the current decoding task if the configuration memory provides enough free space and if a high speed configuration infrastructure is provided. Dynamic reconfiguration during one frame duration is possible when the current configuration is small enough to load a new configuration in the memory. If not, the authors provide management solutions to deal with this issue, such as <b>erasing</b> the <b>current</b> configuration during the last decoding iteration and continuing the reconfiguration process during the first iteration of the new configuration. However, this solution is not always sufficient. Then, stopping the current processing to configure the new configuration is unavoidable and leads to a decoding quality loss in terms of BER. The authors of [22] propose a dynamically reconfigurable ASIP-based architecture for turbo decoding allowing reconfiguration of the entire platform during the current decoding task in order to propose a frame by frame dynamic configuration. This architecture has been optimized based on the initial work presented in [16]. Up to 64 processors are reconfigured using a bus-based configuration infrastructure implementing optimized transfer mechanisms. In this context, this paper aims to bring a complete configuration management solution for multi-processor turbo decoder providing novel solutions allowing for the first time: (1) a run-time evaluation of the number of decoding iterations and the level of sub-block parallelism regarding throughput and bit error rate (BER) requirements and (2) a run-time configuration generation. As a base architecture, the reconfigurable UDec ASIP-based turbo decoder presented in [22] is considered. Therefore, the corresponding architectural parameters in terms of memory bank sizes and communication interfaces between the ASIPs have been used. In this paper, no specific optimizations have been introduced regarding the turbo decoding itself.|$|R
