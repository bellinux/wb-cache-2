5|$|Dodd {{continued}} campaigning <b>in</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> visiting up to {{four different}} cities in one day. Political commentator Bill O'Reilly slammed Dodd after he appeared on The O'Reilly Factor in August, characterizing him as a kool-aid drinker and blind follower of the far left. O'Reilly chastised Dodd and branded him a traitor for his perceived betrayal of fellow Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman during the 2006 Senatorial election.|$|E
5|$|He used a {{somewhat}} negative advertising campaign {{that seemed to}} have the intended initial effect of boosting him to serious contention. His 1988 campaign was based on the platform of supply-side economics and inner-city enterprise zones. In Bare Knuckles and Back Rooms: My Life in American Politics, campaign chairman Rollins described Kemp as a candidate with foibles. Kemp's campaign managers say he was unmanageable: he ignored timers on his speeches, refused to call contributors, and refused to practice for debates. A humbling Super Tuesday, in which his 39delegate total was fewer than eventual nominee and President Bush and both Dole and Pat Robertson, ended his campaign. After withdrawing from the race, he was still considered a contender for the Vice President nomination. In 1989, the Kemps switched their official residence from Hamburg, New York to Bethesda, Maryland, their residence {{at the time of his}} death. In 1994, Kemp's 1988 campaign reached a settlement with the Federal Election Commission by agreeing to pay $120,000 in civil penalties for 1988 campaign election law violations for, among other things, excessive contributions, improper direct corporate donations, press overbilling, exceeding spending limits <b>in</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire,</b> and failure to reimburse corporations for providing air transportation.|$|E
25|$|Romney was {{the first}} {{candidate}} in the 2008 election to begin airing TV and radio advertisements, beginning in February 2007. His advertisements, most of which focus primarily on Romney's conservative credentials, have aired mainly <b>in</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire,</b> which experts credit with helping his early lead in those and other early primary states. Romney's campaign advisors explained that their early advertisement push was {{to make up for}} Romney being relatively unknown compared to contenders Rudy Giuliani, John McCain, and Fred Thompson. On September 4, 2007, Romney was estimated to have spent $2 million in advertisements <b>in</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire.</b>|$|E

At the beginning of May, Gingrich and Santorum suspended their campaigns; Romney was widely reported as the presumptive nominee, with Paul the only other major candidate running an active campaign.|$|E

Media outlets reported that 10 potential presidential candidates had visited Iowa in October. When {{asked about the}} attention given to the state 26 {{months prior to the}} caucus, Bayh replied that he [...] "wish the process didn't begin this early, but it does". Later in the month, former chief counsel and master political strategist for Bayh, Federal District Judge David Hamilton ruled that prayer could not be conducted prior to the opening of the state legislature in Indiana, reasoning that the mention of [...] "Jesus Christ" [...] as [...] "Savior" [...] or [...] "Son of God" [...] is unconstitutional. Commentators argued that the decision diminished Bayh's label as the [...] "centrist candidate" [...] for the Democratic nomination due to his connections to the judge.|$|E
500|$|Colbert's {{timing was}} too late for his name to be added the South Carolina primary ballot, and South Carolina law would not allow for {{write-in}} candidates. [...] Polling showed that 21% of the potential Republican primary electorate reported they would be [...] "more likely" [...] to vote for former candidate Herman Cain, who remained on the ballot, if that vote served as encouragement for Colbert. Herman Cain received 6,338 votes in the South Carolina Republican Primary, which was more than all the other withdrawn candidates received combined. On the next episode of The Colbert Report broadcast on January 23, 2012, Colbert boasted about passing the 1% threshold and for Cain receiving many more votes in South Carolina than <b>in</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire.</b> Colbert then announced that he would no longer be exploring a run for President of the United States of South Carolina.|$|E

2500|$|Romney, on September 5, 2007, began {{advertising}} in South Carolina, the early primary state {{where he was}} doing the poorest.

[...] Many saw Michigan as Romney's last chance for a campaign-saving win after disappointments {{in the first two}} races.

2500|$|After {{a series}} of poor results <b>in</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire,</b> Bush spent his {{remaining}} money and campaign effort on the South Carolina primary. He placed fourth with under 8% of the vote. That night, Bush suspended his campaign, ending his presidential bid, and subsequently endorsed Texas Senator Ted Cruz. [...] In an analysis of what went wrong, POLITICO argues that:"His slow, awkward stumble from August through October encapsulates everything that caused the operation viewed as [...] "Jeb!, Inc." [...] to fail. Bush was {{on the wrong side}} of the most galvanizing issues for Republican primary voters, he himself was a rusty and maladroit campaigner and his campaign was riven by internal disagreements and a crippling fear that left them paralyzed and unable to react to Trump." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 25, 2007, {{five days}} {{before the end of}} the second quarter of {{fundraising}} on June 30, Romney announced that he was again lending his campaign a significant amount of money. [...] He declined to say how much the second contribution would be, but that it was needed in order to run more advertising in battleground states. He said, [...] "It would be nice not to have to loan or contribute to your own campaign... If other people are making sacrifices, I sure have to as well. Itâ€™s not a dream come true. In some respects, itâ€™s kind of a nightmare to write checks from your own bank account."

2500|$|Meanwhile, Michigan {{moved its}} primary to January 15, 2008, also in {{violation}} of party rules. In October 2007, Obama, Richardson, Biden, and Edwards withdrew their names from the Michigan primary ballot, {{under pressure from the}} DNC and voters <b>in</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire.</b> Kucinich unsuccessfully sought to remove his name from the ballot, whereas Clinton and Dodd opted to remain on the ballot. In December 2007, the DNC ruled that Michigan's 128pledged delegates and 29superdelegates would not count in the nominating contest unless it were held on a later date. The Michigan Democratic party responded with a press release noting that the primary would proceed with Clinton, Dodd, Gravel, and Kucinich on the ballot.
