40|$|There is {{much debate}} over the {{development}} of suitable system safety requirements for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). A particular point of contention is the approach for determining the allowable average probability per flight hour of <b>failure</b> <b>conditions.</b> For UAS, there is limited knowledge and data to inform {{the assessment of the}} average probability of <b>failure</b> <b>conditions.</b> This leads to uncertainty in the system safety assessment (SSA) process. Current literature provides no discussion as to how this uncertainty can be managed in the system safety certification (SSC) of a UAS. In addition to this, uncertainty in the average probability of <b>failure</b> <b>conditions</b> is not accounted for in compliance findings, which can result in subjective certification decision-making. This research proposes a new framework for system safety certification under conditions of uncertainty. The new framework is briefly introduced, with the focus of this paper being on the characterisation of uncertainty within the SSA process. A Bayesian approach to the modelling of the average probability of <b>failure</b> <b>conditions</b> is adopted. The traditional assumption of a constant failure rate model is challenged; with a Weibull distribution proposed as a more appropriate representation of UAS failure occurrence...|$|R

We performed experiments with datasets (collected under normal and various simulated <b>failure</b> <b>conditions)</b> using the NASA Ames man-in-the-loop highfidelity C- 17 flight simulator.

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} study was to develop a large animal model of acute ischemic left {{ventricular}} heart failure (LVHF) that can be used to assess the influence of the PUCA pump on the heart and circulatory system under realistic conditions. We tested the hypothesis that mild stenosis of the coronary artery in combination with mild ventricular pacing induces an acute heart <b>failure</b> <b>condition,</b> whereas the separate phenomena themselves do not lead to impaired heart function. Mean aortic pressure (AoP), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), stroke volume (SV) and myocardial systolic shortening (MSS) were compared 30 minutes after a pacemaker (PM) induced tachycardia in anaesthetized sheep (n= 3) without and with +/- 50 % stenosis of the proximal LCx. All parameters measured restored to basic levels when stenosis was absent When the LCx was partially occluded, mild PM-induced tachycardia resulted in decreased AoP (P= 0. 045) as well as in decreased SV (P= 0. 048); the LVEDP remained high (P= 0. 002). Also the recovery of MSS was impaired when stenosis was present (P= 0. 002). These values indicate that acute heart <b>failure</b> <b>conditions</b> were present. The technique used proved to be safe and allowed fine-tuning of the demand ischemia by adapting heart frequency to the required heart <b>failure</b> <b>conditions.</b> The model can be used to study the effect of LV mechanical support during acute heart <b>failure</b> <b>conditions...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{operational}} management of Water Distribution Systems (WDS), particularly under <b>failure</b> <b>conditions</b> when the <b>behaviour</b> of a WDS {{is not well}} understood, is a challenging problem. The research presented in this thesis describes {{the development of a}} methodology for risk-based diagnostics of failures in WDS and its application in a near real-time Decision Support System (DSS) for WDS’ operation. In this thesis, the use of evidential reasoning to estimate the likely location of a burst pipe within a WDS by combining outputs of several models is investigated. A novel Dempster-Shafer model is developed, which fuses evidence provided by a pipe burst prediction model, a customer contact model and a hydraulic model to increase confidence in correctly locating a burst pipe. A new impact model, based on a pressure driven hydraulic solver coupled with a Geographic Information System (GIS) to capture the adverse effects of failures from an operational perspective, is created. A set of Key Performance Indicators used to quantify impact, are aggregated according to the preferences of a Decision Maker (DM) using the Multi-Attribute Value Theory. The potential of distributed computing to deliver a near real-time performance of computationally expensive impact assessment is explored. A novel methodology to prioritise alarms (i. e., detected abnormal flow events) in a WDS is proposed. The relative significance of an alarm is expressed using a measure of an overall risk represented by a set of all potential incidents (e. g., pipe bursts), which might have caused it. The DM’s attitude towards risk is taken into account during the aggregation process. The implementation of the main constituents of the proposed risk-based pipe burst diagnostics methodology, which forms a key component of the aforementioned DSS prototype, are tested on a number of real life and semi-real case studies. The methodology has the potential to enable more informed decisions {{to be made in the}} near real-time failure management in WDS. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The {{last five}} years has seen an {{explosion}} of interest in research on the return of extinguished <b>conditioned</b> <b>behaviour</b> in humans. This interest has resulted from the development of theoretical models of the phenomenon from non-human animal research and the potential application that the research has to explaining relapse following extinction-based treatments for psychological disorders. The recent research conducted with human participants is reviewed. The main return of <b>conditioned</b> <b>behaviour</b> phenomena are renewal, reinstatement, spontaneous recovery, and reacquisition, although recent human research has {{tended to focus on}} only the first two. Human research has employed three main paradigms in the laboratory: fear conditioning procedures, a conditioned suppression task, and causal learning tasks. The basic effects of renewal, reinstatement, and spontaneous recovery have been demonstrated in these tasks and in psychophysiological, behavioural, and subjective measures. However, research has also yielded some inconsistencies among measures as well as differences between the results obtained with human participants and those obtained with non-human animals. There may be some unique factors that mediate the return of extinguished <b>conditioned</b> <b>behaviour</b> in humans. Clinical studies on anxiety and substance dependence have also confirmed that renewal, reinstatement, and spontaneous recovery are potentially important mechanisms that may underlie relapse following extinction-based treatments. There is a clear need for future research to understand the psychological mechanisms behind the return of extinguished <b>conditioned</b> <b>behaviour</b> in humans and to develop ways to reduce its occurrence in clinical treatment.

30|$|The {{study in}} [17] propose {{a method for}} {{evaluating}} the reliability of WSNs designed for industrial IoT applications based on the automatic generation of fault trees (FTs).

A network <b>failure</b> <b>condition</b> {{is defined as a}} combination of SNs which if fail will lead to the failure of the WSN in terms of network coverage only and not connectivity to the sink. To address the connectivity part of the network functionality, the authors propose a depth-first search algorithm that finds all the paths between SNs belonging to the network <b>failure</b> <b>conditions</b> and the sink node. The study in [17] is extended in [15] by assuming that the WSN is also subject to permanent wireless link failures in addition to SN failures under the same assumptions adopted in [17]. In both studies, the authors in [17] and [15] did not address the computational efficiency of their approach.|$|R
