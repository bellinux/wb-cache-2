40|$|A {{technique}} for fast imaging of regional myocardial function using <b>a</b> spiral acquisition <b>in</b> combination with strain-encoded (SENC) {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) is presented in this paper. This technique, which is termed fast-SENC, enables scan durations as short as <b>a</b> single <b>heartbeat.</b> <b>A</b> reduced field of view (FOV) without foldover artifacts was achieved by localized SENC, which selectively excited the region around the heart. The two images required for SENC imaging (low- and high-tuning) were acquired <b>in</b> <b>an</b> interleaved fashion throughout the cardiac cycle to further shorten the scan time. Regional circumferential contraction and longitudinal shortening of both the left ventricle (LV) and right ventricle (RV) were examined in long- and short-axis views, respectively. The in vivo results obtained from five human subjects and five infarcted dogs are presented. The results of the fast-SENC technique <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single <b>heartbeat</b> acquisition were comparable to those obtained by conventional SENC <b>in</b> <b>a</b> long acquisition time.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{dramatic}} {{shortage of}} kidney donors has triggered interest in {{other sources of}} organs, such as donors without <b>a</b> <b>heartbeat.</b> Accumulating {{evidence suggests that the}} short-term survival of cadaveric kidneys from such donors {{is similar to that of}} cadaveric kidneys from donors with <b>a</b> <b>heartbeat.</b> However, no data from large, matched studies with long-term follow-up are available. We conducted a matched, single-center study of kidney transplants obtained from donors without <b>a</b> <b>heartbeat</b> and those from donors with <b>a</b> <b>heartbeat,</b> with <b>a</b> 15 -year follow-up period. METHODS: Between 1985 and 2000, 122 kidney transplantations involving donors without <b>a</b> <b>heartbeat</b> were performed at the University of Zurich, in Switzerland. Outcomes of these procedures were compared with those of 122 transplantations of kidneys from donors with <b>a</b> <b>heartbeat.</b> The recipients were matched according to age, sex, number of transplantations, and calendar period of transplantation. RESULTS: The characteristics of the recipients did not differ significantly between the two groups. We observed a significantly higher incidence of delayed graft function among the patients who received kidneys from donors without <b>a</b> <b>heartbeat</b> (48. 4 percent) than among the patients who received kidneys from donors with <b>a</b> <b>heartbeat</b> (23. 8 percent) (P< 0. 001).
