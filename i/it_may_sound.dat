25|$|The entire landmass of Southern California was {{subdivided}} {{according to}} the San Bernardino Meridian, which was first plotted {{as part of the}} Public Land Survey System in November 1852, by Col. Henry Washington. Base Line road, a major thoroughfare, today runs from Highland to San Dimas, intermittently along the absolute baseline coordinates plotted by Col. Washington. San Bernardino County was first formed out of parts of Los Angeles County on April 26, 1853. While the partition once included what is today most of Riverside County, the region is not as monolithic as <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>sound.</b> Rivalries between Colton, Redlands, Riverside and San Bernardino over the location of the county seat in the 1890s caused each of them to form their own civic communities, each with their own newspapers. On August 14, 1893, the state Senate allowed Riverside County to form out of land previously in San Bernardino and San Diego counties, after rejecting a bill for Pomona to split from L.A. County and become the seat of what would have been called San Antonio County.|$|E

500|$|Reviews from {{critics were}} mostly strong, with many {{saying that the}} {{extended}} length of gameplay and the new features were valued additions that kept the sequels as interesting as the original games. Craig Harris of IGN gave the games a [...] "masterful" [...] 10 out of 10 rating, stating that: [...] "As awesome as the original Pokémon edition was, Pokémon Gold and Silver blow it away in gameplay elements, features, and goodies. There are so many little additions to the design it's impossible to list them all". There was particular praise given to the innovative internal clock feature, with Frank Povo of GameSpot, noting: [...] "The first major addition to Pokémon GS {{is the presence of}} a time element... Although <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>sound</b> like a gimmick, the addition of a clock adds quite a bit of variety to the game". Povo went on to give the games a [...] "great" [...] 8.8 rating.

2500|$|Singing differs {{by region}} in {{that a high}} falsetto {{is used in the}} north while in the south a lower range is used. [...] "To the {{unfamiliar}} listener, Indian singing sounds exotic, different, and difficult to comprehend," [...] and the contrast in the quality or timbre of voice used in traditional Indian and European musics may {{have much to do with}} that difficulty. However, [...] "to the trained ear, melodies flow, ascend and descend" [...] while dancers react to changes in the structure of the melody and the song. Boye Ladd says, [...] "If you give me a stink song, I'll dance stink. If you give me good music, I'll give you a great show," [...] implying that one can appreciate the music through the dancing, which is readily appreciated by everyone. But others say that today's contemporary contest dancers are expected to dance their best no matter how well or poor the drum group is that is singing for their contest.

[...] A reviewer for Crash also gave the ZX Spectrum version a positive review, with a 91/100 rating. He praised the variety and gameplay of the game, and noted that [...] "while <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>sound</b> pretty basic [...] it’s when you start discovering things, making use of objects, finding hidden treasures that it really comes alive.

He later starred opposite Mahira Khan in Sarmad Khoosat's emotional TV serial drama Humsafar, for which he won Best Actor award at the Lux Style Awards in 2012. Writing for The Indian Express, Ranika Rajani praised Humsafar saying, [...] "The Pakistani drama is {{a breath of fresh}} air in comparison to its Indian counterparts." [...] Writing about the performers she said, [...] "The chemistry between Mahira Khan and Fawad Khan is also one of the reasons why Humsafar is a must watch. Both of them convincingly wow you with their performance." [...] Zee News's critic Ritka Handoo also praised the lead performances saying, [...] "The lead pair, Fawad Khan and Mahira Khan, has struck just the right chord. We as audiences have been finally gifted a new albeit quite believable on screen couple." [...] The following year, he appeared in Sarmad Khoosat's TV series, Ashk which received a negative review from The Express Tribune critic. The same year, Khan played a member of an affluent family opposite Sanam Saeed in Sultana Siddiqui's family drama TV series Zindagi Gulzar Hai. Dipti Sharma of The Indian Express praised his performance and wrote: [...] "Fawad Khan was a breeze of fresh air, as cliched as <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>sound.</b> So, watching Fawad Khan, a man in his early 30s, playing a mature character with so many layers, nuances and subtlety, it is hard not to admire him." [...] For this role, he won Best Actor-Popular award at the Hum Awards and the Best Actor satellite at Lux Style Awards, and with Saeed he won the Best Onscreen Couple award in both popular and jury categories at the Hum Awards. His last TV serial was Ahson Talish's sociodrama Numm. Broadcast in 2013, the drama saw Khan play a boy who secretly marries a girl in London and, after returning Pakistan, is forced to marry another girl. Behadd, director Asim Raza's telefilm, featured Khan as a young divorcee who proposes to a widow who has a teenage daughter. The Times of India noted that Khan's character in Behadd was different from those he played in Humsafar and Zindagi Gulzar Hai and praised his performance writing, [...] "Behadd is another benchmark of Pakistani television heartthrob Fawad Khan." [...] His last telefilm was Anjum Shahzad's romance Armaan opposite Aamina Sheikh, where he played a young, flirtatious boy.|$|E
