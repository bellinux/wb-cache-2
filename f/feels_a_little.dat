500|$|While {{reviewing}} the episode in 2011, Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club noted, [...] "perhaps because he’s a fucking dog, Santa’s Little Helper is never developed as fully {{as the other}} characters, so the requisite episode-ending orgy of sentimentality when Santa's Little Helper is joyously reunited with Bart <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> cheap and unearned." ...|$|E
500|$|Other critics, however, did {{not respond}} well to the episode. Andrew Billen of The Times thought that the episode was [...] "not as stylish, {{intelligent}} or classy as it hopes" [...] and [...] "about as subtle as Times Square". He called Close's performance [...] "not remotely credible but impressive in a Norma Desmond way" [...] and labeled Byrne as [...] "particularly unstriking". Brian Lowry gave the pilot a lukewarm review for Variety. He praised the [...] "solid cast" [...] and [...] "smart dialogue", but felt that [...] "the template <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too familiar ... moreover, it's fuzzy how long the show's mystery will persist". Entertainment Weeklys Gillian Flynn graded the episode as a C, criticizing the characters' lack of logic and the [...] "many ludicrous scenes". She thought the storylines to be overcomplicated and called Byrne [...] "bland" [...] and [...] "inexpressive".|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, Lion Heart {{garnered}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Slant Magazines Anzhe Zhang {{wrote that the}} album was released to [...] "quash" [...] the suspicions that Girls' Generation was declining after the departure of member Jessica in September 2014. However, she added, [...] "while 's great for omnivorous die-hard fans, it ultimately <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more than scatter-brained." [...] Chester Chin, penning for Malaysian newspaper The Star, praised the release of singles [...] "Party", [...] "Lion Heart" [...] and [...] "You Think" [...] as [...] "a promising start." [...] Nevertheless, he disapproved {{of the rest of}} the album, dubbing it a [...] "relatively tame offering" [...] for [...] " [...] way too quickly into filler territory" [...] and criticizing the songs [...] "Green Light" [...] and [...] "Paradise" [...] for being too [...] "generic." [...] Kim Do-heon from South Korean online magazine IZM was slightly more positive towards the album, calling it [...] "elegant", and appreciating the record's musical styles even though he felt that it was a decline compared to the group's previous albums as a nine-piece group.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly Abby West {{wrote that}} [...] "Rory's crooning take" [...] of [...] "Blue Christmas" [...] was [...] "smooth and lovely", {{and gave it}} a [...] "B+", and Flandez agreed with the in-show {{assessment}} that it was [...] "mournfully beautiful". Futterman said that the song [...] "perfectly suits his vocals", but was unimpressed with Rory [...] "standing awkwardly" [...] through the song; Michael Slezak of TVLine noted the static staging and filming of the number {{and gave it a}} [...] "C", and while Chaney said he sang it [...] "just fine", she said he [...] "didn't sell it", and gave it a [...] "C+". Rachel's rendition of [...] "River" [...] also received divergent assessments. Chaney and Slezak both gave it an [...] "A−": the former remarked that she [...] "knows how to make the emotion in a song soar", and the latter said [...] "damn if she didn't sound amazing", though he pointed out the incongruity of Rachel having just stated after Rory's song that uptempo and jolly is the way to go, only to sing this song, which is anything but. VanDerWerff agreed that there was [...] "no good reason for Rachel to sing it", and Flandez called it a [...] "forgettable version". Futterman's conclusion was that [...] "it <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> phoned in and doesn't emotionally connect".|$|E
500|$|The song has {{received}} critical acclaim. Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone gave the song a positive review commenting, [...] "Swift's voice is unaffected enough to mask how masterful {{she has become}} as a singer; she lowers her voice for the payoff lines in the classic mode of a shy girl trying to talk tough." [...] Jonathan Keefe from Slant Magazine complimented Swift's ability [...] "to write an indelible melody" [...] and praised {{the production of the}} song, writing [...] " [...] showcase(s) Swift's unique knack for matching the overall tone of a melody to the broader themes of a song". He added that [...] "it isn't easy to make a melancholy song like [...] "Back to December" [...] sound catchy at the same time, but that's what Swift does, and it's an impressive trick." [...] Bobby Peacock from Roughstock gave the song four stars out of five and praised Swift's vocal, saying that [...] "it's her best vocal since [...] "Tim McGraw"". He concluded that [...] " [...] <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more focused, a little more mature and a little better-sung than her previous material." [...] The Oxonian Review considers it the centerpiece of the melancholic album, noting how [...] "equating regret with December is a mainstream American musical tradition" [...] and this song is [...] "the congruence of her singing and songwriting at its finest." ...|$|E

In an interview with The New York Times, Tom Ascheim said that [...] "the show's quirky appeal extended far beyond Noggin's target audience. 'The simplicity is really understandable by my two-year-old, but my ten-year-old really giggles at Oobi. Andrew Dalton of The Stir stated {{that he was a}} fan of the show himself, adding that Oobi is [...] "just happy to be simple and gleeful, and that actually makes it more appealing to sit and watch as a grown-up." [...] The San Diego Union-Tribunes Jane Clifford felt that it could be enjoyed by viewers of all ages, remarking that [...] "if as a kid you ever drew eyes or a mouth on your hand and then 'talked' to a friend, you'll relate to this show." [...] Oppositely, Rebecca Brayton of WatchMojo.com felt that while Oobi [...] "had the intentions to build academic skills in children ... it left their parents empty-handed." [...] Evan Levine of The Star Democrat stated in his review that [...] "it is certainly fun for preschoolers {{to be able to make}} their own Oobis, and they’ll no doubt relate to some of the issues discussed … parents, however, may find that the show wears thin quickly and <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> forced." ...|$|E
500|$|On February 4, 2016, Marvel {{released}} {{their own}} version of the Facebook [...] "#FriendsDay" [...] video for Captain America. The video mirrors those created by Facebook for users to celebrate the anniversary of Facebook's founding, and features images of Captain America's [...] "friends" [...] the Winter Soldier, Thor, Falcon and Hawkeye. The video concludes with an image of Captain America and Iron Man being torn in half. Jennifer Konerman of The Hollywood Reporter called the video [...] "timely" [...] and its contents [...] "especially relevant considering the storyline" [...] of Civil War. Three days later, a teaser debuted during Super Bowl 50, which received the most social media activity out of all the film trailers released that day. Anthony Breznican of Entertainment Weekly said the footage [...] "actually <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more like a teaser , since it shows some new shots, but really doesn’t reveal much more about the story." [...] Additionally, he felt the chanting [...] "unseen voices calling out, 'United...We...Stand' and 'Divided...We...Fall'" [...] had [...] "a football stadium vibe", complimenting it appearing during the Super Bowl. Mendelson added that Marvel did not need to follow the model used for The Winter Soldier during Super Bowl XLVIII of showing a longer trailer after the teaser since Civil War was [...] "frankly [...] higher-profile sequel." [...] Overall, Mendelson felt the spot was [...] "only a little less low-key and small(er)-scale as the trailer that debuted in" [...] November 2015, and sold the [...] "real world" [...] aspect [...] "with character drama and mostly real-world action between would-be superheroes." ...|$|E
500|$|Peter Timmis of Cross Rhythms gave Move nine stars {{out of ten}} squares, commenting that [...] " [...] If {{you like}} your rock soulful and gospel-tinged then 'Move' is an album you'll want to check out". Glenn McCarty of Crosswalk.com said that [...] "As always, Third Day plays to its strength... to craft accessible, {{interesting}} country rock. When it clicks, the result is arm-hair-raising good. Move, unfortunately, doesn't produce that reaction often enough... Move <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too safe, or, said another way, a little too static". Lindsay Williams of Gospel Music Channel said that [...] "Move may not be Third Day’s best effort in their large discography, but it’s certainly {{a treasure trove of}} hooky rock. After more than 15 years, this band still has something to say, and they say it well". John DiBiase of Jesus Freak Hideout gave the album four-and-a-half out of five stars, opining [...] "Move showcases some of the best Third Day has to offer. Whether it's better than Revelation or some of their other previous installments (like Wire or Conspiracy No. 5) is something to leave up to the listener to decide, but it does feel safe enough to say that Third Day's Move is a dozen tracks of southern rock goodness". Brian Mansfield of USA Today gave the album two-and-a-half out of four stars, saying [...] "Whether accompanied by sharp-edged electric or slippery resonator guitars, a kids choir or the Blind Boys of Alabama, Third Day's Southern rock remains grounded in the band's faith".|$|E

Ann Arbor is nearly 43 miles by car from downtown Detroit, and developed separately as a university city, with its own character.

Such novelty, of course, doesn't make Benaroya Hall an especially excellent set (in fact, it <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> one-dimensional and subdued because of the acoustic instrumentation), though it is one of the more unique and interesting of the many, many shows Pearl Jam released publicly over the years."

2500|$|The pinball {{tables in}} Zen Pinball {{received}} mixed commentary from critics. [...] Some reviewers felt that four tables was {{too little to}} be shipped in the game.

[...] Destructoid's Brad Nicholson also agreed, stating [...] "With only four tables, {{all of which can}} be accessed from the very beginning, Zen Pinball <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> light on variety." [...] Six additional tables were later released as downloadable content. [...] Nicholson, however, went on to praise solid table design and functionality.

[...] GameSpot awarded the game 8.5 out of ten and said [...] "This fast-paced racer keeps you glued to the TV and {{on the edge of}} your seat regardless of which side of the law you're playing on." [...] Official Xbox Magazine gave the Xbox 360 version 7 out of 10, and said [...] "Hot Pursuit <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too safe for its subject matter, limited by pedestrian road design that doesn't express all the playfulness that we'd expect in car combat." [...] However, the UK edition of the magazine gave the game a 9 out of 10, and said [...] "It pays respect to the classic NFS games, borrows the best bits from Burnout and is a technical masterpiece. The chase to reclaim NFSs once legendary chart topping form is well and truly on." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bill Lamb from About.com {{was mixed}} with his review, stating: [...] "Starships {{is a solid}} outing for Nicki Minaj. However, the day-glo pop-rap success of 'Super Bass', {{emotional}} power of 'Fly', and experimentation of her Grammy Awards performance has left us expecting Nicki Minaj to push boundaries. 'Starships' <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit like retreating into a musical pocket and trying a little too hard to insure another pop chart hit. The result is pleasurable but not particularly memorable." [...] Bloggers for Billboard magazine, Andrew Hampp and Erika Ramirez, criticized the track for, [...] "...monstrous pop hooks that overshadow its throwaway lyrics", while stating that it is, [...] "the most polarizing single in Minaj's career to date". The pair also noticed that Minaj seemed to be exploring her [...] "musical identity" [...] through singing {{instead of focusing on}} her strengths. Slant Magazine stated that [...] "Starships (along with 'Pound the Alarm', 'Whip It', and 'Automatic') are [...] "retro-techno-pop earsores [...] indiscriminately arranged bits of LMFAO's 'Sexy and I Know It', Rihanna's 'We Found Love', and pretty much any recent Britney Spears or Katy Perry song you can name" [...] adding that [...] "For the chorus to her self-affirmation anthem, Minaj shouts 'Starships were meant to fly!', echoing Katy Perry's 'Baby, you're a firework!' for its uncomprehending intuition that if something is in the sky then it must also be inspiring." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{some critics}} viewed the album's sound as unoriginal and dated. Johnny Dee of Virgin Media said [...] "Flesh Tone marks a thrilling {{comeback}} ... The only complaint {{is that at}} 9 tracks it <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> light." [...] Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquenmani was more critical of Kelis' direction towards dance music, stating that the album [...] "sounds dated in {{the worst kind of}} way—that is, not enough to sound retro-cool, but enough to sound totally uncool. It helps that the album ... segued together with interludes that are more interesting than the actual songs. Flesh Tone should sound desperate, but it often sounds inspired instead. Kelis seems electrified by her new genre shift, and the result is an album that's one of her most consistent to date." [...] Kaya Burgess of The Times pointed out that 'Acapella' and 'Home' are the only tracks which [...] "stand out from an otherwise rather copy-and-paste collection of electronic numbers". Magaret Wappler of Los Angeles Times expressed that Kelis has managed to [...] "make a spirited but disciplined set of classic Euro-club bangers. Sometimes they're darkly contemplative, slipping into trance; other times they nearly rip at the seams ... it's clear that Kelis has carved out a new niche for herself, dancing in front of the turntables till the lights come on, if they dare." [...] Sam Richards of Uncut complimented its fusion of [...] "R sass to thumping club beats" [...] and stated [...] "most everything Kelis touches drips with class". Gavin Haynes of the NME felt that [...] "Flesh Tone has already filled out an application form for pop record of the year" [...] and stated, [...] "Her ability to appear unimpeachably cool hasn't wavered either. But these are as nothing. What's important here is simply her direction: a genuinely innovative bearing that breaks new ground for pop without sounding any less pop for it. Kelis. Genius. Pop auteur." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{praising the}} {{performances}} of Cumberbatch and Knightley, Catherine Shoard of The Guardian stated that the film is [...] "too formulaic, too efficient at simply whisking you through and making sure you've clocked the diversity message". Tim Robey of The Telegraph described it as [...] "a film about a human calculator which <b>feels...</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too calculated". Some critics also raised concerns about film's alleged reluctance to highlight Turing's homosexuality. British historian Alex von Tunzelmann, writing for The Guardian in November 2014, pointed out many historical inaccuracies in the film, saying in conclusion: [...] "Historically, The Imitation Game is {{as much of a}} garbled mess as a heap of unbroken code". Journalist Christian Caryl also found numerous historical inaccuracies, describing the film as constituting [...] "a bizarre departure from the historical record" [...] that changed Turing's rich life to be [...] "multiplex-friendly". L.V. Anderson of Slate magazine compared the film's account of Turing's life and work to the biography it was based on, writing, [...] "I discovered that The Imitation Game takes major liberties with its source material, injecting conflict where none existed, inventing entirely fictional characters, rearranging the chronology of events, and misrepresenting the very nature of Turing's work at Bletchley Park". Andrew Grant of Science News wrote, [...] "... like so many other Hollywood biopics, it takes some major artistic license – which is disappointing, because Turing's actual story is so compelling." [...] Computing historian Thomas Haigh, writing in the journal Communications of the ACM, said that [...] "the film is a bad guide to reality but a useful summary of everything that the popular imagination gets wrong about Bletchley Park", that it [...] "combines the traditional focus of popular science writing on the lone genius who changes the world with the modern movie superhero narrative of a freak who must overcome his own flaws before he can save the world", and that, together with the likes of A Beautiful Mind and The Theory of Everything, is part of a trend of [...] "glossy scientific biopic" [...] that emphasize those famous scientists who were surrounded by tragedy rather than those who found contented lives, which in turn affects the way [...] "ome kinds of people, and work, have become famous and others have not." ...|$|E
