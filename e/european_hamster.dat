40|$|Summary. -The {{carcinogenic}} {{effects of}} di-isopropanolnitrosamine (DIPN) {{were tested in}} hibernating and non-hibernating <b>European</b> <b>hamsters.</b> The results obtained were compared with those produced by the same substance in Syrian golden hamsters and Sprague-Dawley rats. In <b>European</b> <b>hamsters,</b> tumours were produced in the nasal cavity, trachea, lung, liver and pancreas. The main target organs were the anterior part of the nasal cavity and liver. Only cholangiomas and cholangiocarci-nomas {{were found in the}} liver. Early changes in the intrahepatic bile ducts and duct epithelium of the pancreas were seen 4 weeks after treatment was started. Fourteen out of 144 treated hamsters developed pancreatic-duct tumours, 2 of which were malignant. The tumorigenic response in the target organs was lower in hibernating than in non-hibernating animals. DI-ISOPROPANOLNITROSAMINE (DIPN) primarily affected the pancreas, liver and kidneys of Syrian golden hamsters. It also induced neoplasms in the respiratory tract, mostly in the nasal cavities and lungs (Kruger, Pour and Althoff, 1974; Pour et al., 1974; 1975 a, b). In contrast, DIPN treatment in rats resulted in the development of only one pancreatic tu-mour in 150 animals, most neoplasms occurring in the nasal cavities, thyroid gland, renal pelvis and liver (Mohr, Reznik and Pour, 1977; Reznik and Mohr, 1976).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether hibernating <b>European</b> <b>hamsters</b> Cricetus cricetus, L., 1758 stay in their burrows all winter or if they occasionally spent time above ground. If ‘time (spent) above ground’ (TAG) occurred regularly throughout hibernation, the second objective of this work was to categorize and quantify the patterns of TAG during winter. For this purpose, 11 <b>European</b> <b>hamsters</b> were individually housed in wire mesh cages that were buried in the ground of an outdoor enclosure. Each cage was filled with soil up to ground level allowing the animals to construct their own burrows within the cages. Antennae in the bottom and top of the cage were calibrated to receive signals only when the hamsters were in their burrows or above the ground, respectively. This method enabled continuous recordings of the animal’s TAG and provided ecologically meaningful results as the animals were housed in a way that closely resembled their natural habitat. About half of the hamsters stayed continuously below ground. Of these hamsters, almost all showed a dense pattern of episodes of reduced body temperature separated by only brief periods of normothermia. In contrast, the other half of the animals moved either episodically or even regularly above ground. For all of these hamsters, TAG was significantly reduced as compared to normothermic values.

Perhaps Patrick took it from Alexander's unpublished notes or perhaps it was Patrick's own addition to the book in the second edition. The Hamster is less common than the field mouse. I once found upon dissecting one of them, the pouch on each side stuffed with young french beans, arranged lengthways so exactly, and close to each other, that it appeared strange by what mechanism it had been effected; for the membrane which forms the pouch, though muscular, is thin, and the most expert fingers could not have packed the beans in a more regular order.

40|$|Abstract Body {{temperature}} (Tb) {{of seven}} <b>European</b> <b>hamsters</b> maintained at constant ambient temperature (Ta = 8 ° C) and constant photoperiod (LD 8 : 16) was recorded throughout the hibernating season using in-traperitoneal temperature-sensitive HF transmitters. The animals spent about 30 % of the hibernation season in hypothermia and 70 % in inter-bout normothermy. Three types of hypothermia, namely deep hibernation bouts (DHBs), short hibernation bouts (SHBs), and short and shallow hibernation bouts (SSHBs), were distinguished by differences in bout duration and mini-mal body temperature (Tm). A gradual development of SSHBs from the diel minimum of Tb during normo-thermy {{could be seen}} in individual hamsters, suggesting a stepwise decrease of the homeostatic setpoint of Tb regulation during the early hibernation season. Entry into hibernation followed a 24 -h rhythm occurring at preferred times of the day in all three types of hypo-thermia. DHBs and SHBs were initiated approximately 4 h before SSHBs, indicating a general difference in the physiological initiation of SSHBs {{on the one hand and}} DHBs and SHBs on the other. Arousals from SHBs and SSHBs also followed a 24 -h rhythm, whereas sponta-neous arousals from DHBs were widely scattered across day and night. Statistical analyses of bout length and the interval between arousals revealed evidence for a free-running circadian rhythm underlying the timing of arousals. The results clearly demonstrate that entries into hypothermia are linked to the light/dark-cycle. However, the role of the circadian system in the timing of arousals from DHBs remains unclear...|$|R

40|$|The spatial genetic {{structure}} of common hamsters (Cricetus cricetus) was investigated using three partial mitochondrial (mt) genes and 11 nuclear microsatellite loci. All marker systems revealed significant population differentiation across Europe. Hamsters {{in central and}} western Europe belong largely to two allopatric mitochondrial lineages south and northwest of the Carpathian and Sudetes. The southern group, 'Pannonia', comprises populations inside the Carpathian basin (Czech Republic, Hungary) while the second group, 'North', includes hamsters from Belgium, the Netherlands, France, and Germany. Isolation of the lineages is maintained {{by a combination of}} geographical and ecological barriers. Both main phylogeographical groups show signs of further subdivision. North is separated into highly polymorphic central German and less polymorphic western populations, which most likely split during late glacial expansion (15 00010 000 bp). Clock estimates based on haplotype distributions predict a divergence of the two major lineages 85 000147 000 bp. Expansion times fall during the last glaciation (115 00010 000 bp) corroborating fossil data, which identify Cricetus cricetus as characteristic of colder climatic phases. Despite the allopatry of mt haplotypes, there is an overlap of nuclear microsatellite alleles between phylogeographical units. Although there are strong evidence that Pannonian hamsters have persisted inside the Carpathian basin over the last 50 000 years, genetic differentiation among <b>European</b> <b>hamsters</b> has mainly been caused by immigration from different eastern refugia.

40|$|SummaryAnimals {{living in}} {{temperate}} zones anticipate seasonal environmental changes to adapt their biological functions, especially reproduction and metabolism. Two main physiological mechanisms have evolved for this adaptation: intrinsic long-term timing mechanisms with an oscillating period of approximately 1 year, {{driven by a}} circannual clock [1], and synchronization of biological rhythms to the sidereal year using day length (photoperiod) [2]. In mammals, the pineal hormone melatonin relays photoperiodic information to the hypothalamus to control seasonal physiology through well-defined mechanisms [3 – 6]. In contrast, {{little is known about}} how the circannual clock drives endogenous changes in seasonal functions. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether genes involved in photoperiodic time measurement (TSHβ and Dio 2) and central control of reproduction (Rfrp and Kiss 1) display circannual rhythms in expression under constant conditions. Male <b>European</b> <b>hamsters,</b> deprived of seasonal time cues by pinealectomy and maintenance in constant photoperiod, were selected when expressing a subjective summer or subjective winter state in their circannual cycle of body weight, temperature, and testicular size. TSHβ expression in the pars tuberalis (PT) displayed a robust circannual variation with highest level in the subjective summer state, which was positively correlated with hypothalamic Dio 2 and Rfrp expression. The negative sex steroid feedback was found to act specifically on arcuate Kiss 1 expression. Our findings reveal TSH as a circannual output of the PT, which in turn regulates hypothalamic neurons controlling reproductive activity. Therefore, both the circannual and the melatonin signals converge on PT TSHβ expression to synchronize seasonal biological activity...|$|R

Some shift of calcium uptake rate and calcium affinity {{similar to that of}} a fast-twitch muscle was also observed in winter active animals kept at 22 degrees C under natural photoperiod. By contrast, the activity of the calcium dependent ATPase was not increased, suggesting a tighter coupling during hibernation between calcium dependent ATP-hydrolysis and calcium transport. No seasonal difference was observed in the calcium release by KCl-caffeine from calcium loaded vesicles of sarcoplasmic reticulum. Proportion and size of fibre types were studied with cold cross sections from psoas and soleus muscles. An average atrophy of about 25 % was found during hibernation in both muscles. Cytochemistry revealed, however, a different reduction of cross area between type-I- and type-II-fibres, which reaches values up to 46 % in the type-II-fast-fibres of the slow soleus muscle. Electron microscopy did not show any definite change in the distribution and amount of sarcoplasmic reticulum. The results suggest that during hibernation a modulation in the properties of calcium transport ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum occurs to better support the calcium transport function at low temperatures, which in turn warrants the restoration of ion homeostasis {{in the course of the}} arousal...|$|R
