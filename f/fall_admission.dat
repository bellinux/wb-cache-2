5000|$|Dull {{played an}} {{important}} role in the successful racial integration of Georgia Tech in 1961. After riots occurred during when black students enrolled at the University of Georgia in January 1961, Dull was assigned to develop a plan to accomplish integration at Georgia Tech peacefully. Implementation of Dull's plans began on January 17, when university president Edwin Harrison called a meeting of the student body at which he told students that the institution would not condone riots, demonstrations or disturbances, or that any student who instigated such activity could be faced with [...] "immediate dismissal." [...] In May 1961, Harrison announced that three black students had been accepted for <b>fall</b> <b>admission,</b> and Dull started a series of interactions with student leaders and organizations aimed at winning their support and cooperation for integration. After several months of planning by Georgia Tech's president and staff, integration was achieved that fall without any incidents. Georgia Tech became the first university in the Deep South to desegregate peacefully and without a court order, with Ford Greene, Ralph A. Long, Jr., and Lawrence Michael Williams becoming Georgia Tech's first three African American students. In later years, Harrison credited Dull with the institution's success in achieving integration without incident.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{the severity of}} adverse drug reactions {{as a factor in}} hospital admission of older patients, and to identify risk indicators for severe adverse drug reactions in these patients. DESIGN: Observational cross-sectional study. SETTING: Five wards in a university hospital in The Netherlands. SUBJECTS: Patients aged 70 and over admitted to general medical wards. METHODS: Use of statistical comparison and Kramer's algorithm. RESULTS: A severe adverse drug reaction was present in 25 (24 %) of 106 patients. Thirteen patients (12 %; 95 % confidence interval 6. 1 - 18. 6 %) were admitted probably because of an adverse drug reaction. Risk indicators for a severe adverse drug reaction were a <b>fall</b> before <b>admission</b> (odds ratio 51. 3, P = 0. 006), gastrointestinal bleeding or haematuria (odds ratio 19. 8, P < 0. 001) and the use of three or more drugs (odds ratio 9. 8, P = 0. 04).

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that higher vitamin D intakes beyond current recommendations {{may be associated with}} better health outcomes. In this chapter, evidence is summarized from different studies that evaluate threshold levels for serum 25 (OH) D levels in relation to bone mineral density (BMD), lower extremity function, dental health, risk of <b>falls,</b> <b>admission</b> to nursing home, fractures, cancer prevention and incident hypertension. For all endpoints, the most advantageous serum levels for 25 (OH) D appeared to be at least 75 nmol/l (30 ng/ml) and for cancer prevention, desirable 25 (OH) D levels are between 90 - 120 nmol/l (36 - 48 ng/ml). An intake of no less than 1000 IU (25 mcg) of vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) per day for all adults may bring at least 50 % of the population up to 75 nmol/l. Thus, higher doses of vitamin D are needed to bring most individuals into the desired range. While estimates suggest that 2000 IU vitamin D 3 per day may successfully and safely achieve this goal, the implications of 2000 IU or higher doses for the total adult population need to be addressed in future studies...|$|R

An external link to the publisher’s copy is includedObjective: To examine evolving changes in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in South Australia and Australia as a whole from the perspective of hospital admissions, ventilatory support and mortality data. Design: Retrospective analyses, for the period 1993 – 2003, of hospital separations data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and the Integrated South Australian Activity Collection, and mortality data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and South Australian hospital morbidity collection. Main outcome measures: Hospital separations, ventilatory support episodes, mortality rates, burden-of-disease rankings. Results: Between 1993 and 2003, in SA and nationally, hospital separations for asthma declined but separations for COPD increased significantly. Falling mortality rates from asthma in both men and women, and from COPD in men, contrast with increasing rates of COPD-related hospitalisation and mortality in women. Conclusions: Hospital admissions and mortality associated with asthma have <b>fallen.</b> <b>Admission</b> rates for COPD are declining for men, but {{there is no indication that}} admission rates for women have reached a peak.

40|$|Background: Elderly {{patients}} {{are at a}} 4 -fold higher risk of adverse drug events (ADEs) and drug-related hospitalization. Hospitalization of an elderly patient is often preceded by geriatric syndromes, like falls or delirium. Objectives: The primary {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether geriatric syndromes were associated with ADEs in acutely admitted elderly patients. Methods: Consecutive medical patients, aged 65 years or more, who were acutely admitted, were enrolled. An initial multidisciplinary evaluation was completed and baseline characteristics were collected. A <b>fall</b> before <b>admission</b> was retrieved from medical charts. Delirium was determined by the Confusion Assessment Method. Results: A total of 641 patients were included. Over 25 % had an ADE present at admission, 26 % presented with delirium and 12 % with a fall. Delirium was associated with the use of antidepressants, antipsychotics and antiepileptics. In all ADEs (n = 167), ADEs were associated with a fall, with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or diuretics, but not with pre-existing functioning, delirium or older age. For ADEs involving psychoactive medication (n = 35), an association was found between delirium, falls, opioids and antipsychotics in bivariate analyses. A fall just before hospitalization (odds ratio [OR] 3. 69 [95 % Cl 1. 41, 9. 67]), antipsychotics (OR 3. 70 [95 % CI 1. 19, 11. 60]) and opioids (OR 14. 57 [95 % CI 2. 02, 105. 30]) remained independently associated with an ADE involving psychoactive medication. Conclusion: This prospective study demonstrated that, in a cohort of elderly hospital patients, a <b>fall</b> before <b>admission</b> and prevalent delirium are associated with several pharmacological groups and/or with ADE-related hospital admissio...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE. Despite <b>falling</b> <b>admissions</b> {{and declining}} lengths of stay, Medicare {{expenditures}} for inpatient physician services {{have continued to}} climb; this article seeks to understand this trend by examining the expenditures on a per admission basis. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SETTING. One hundred percent Medicare claims data were available from nine states for the 1985 - 1988 time period. STUDY DESIGN. Because Medicare's prospective payment system encourages hospitals to shift some services outside the inpatient setting, we examined trends in episodes of care, encompassing some time {{both before and after}} the inpatient stay itself. Trends were also examined at the individual DRG level in order to partially control for case-mix shifts and increased surgical use. Allowed charges were purged of both Medicare fee updates and geographic price variation in order to derive estimates of real spending growth. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS. Hospital and physician claims were merged to form inpatient episodes that included seven days prior to admission as well as 30 days following discharge. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS. Physician spending per episode increased 27 percent just over this four-year time period, but with considerable variation by DRG ranging from only 2 percent for transurethral prostatectomies (TURPs) to 56 percent for uncomplicated acute myocardial infarctions (AMIs). Changes in case severity and hospital and physician characteristics were all found to be important contributors to the increase in physician inpatient spending. Most important seemed to be the growth in the number of physicians associated with the inpatient stay (and the subsequent increase in diagnostic tests and other procedures). CONCLUSIONS. The findings suggest that control of technology and control of the number of physicians involved in the care of a patient are both critical to constraining the rate of increase in physician inpatient expenditures...|$|R

Although the prevalence of uncomplicated peptic ulcers is <b>falling,</b> hospital <b>admissions</b> for ulcer complications associated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are rising. Evidence suggests that coprescription of NSAIDs with potent antiulcer agents and the use of highly selective cyclo-oxygenase- 2 inhibitors reduce gastroduodenal ulceration.
