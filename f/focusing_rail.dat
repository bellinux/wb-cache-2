40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{a successful}} community-led initiative to improve service on commuter rail and examines whether this initiative's <b>focus</b> on commuter <b>rail</b> in particular [...] {{as opposed to}} a focus on other modes of transit [...] affected the strategies of community members' participation and actions. It finds that despite the project's <b>focus</b> on commuter <b>rail</b> and significant community involvement, the <b>focus</b> on commuter <b>rail</b> was largely incidental to the strategies used. The case study used is the Fairmount Line, a 9. 2 -mile Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority commuter rail line that passes through largely low-income, minority neighborhoods entirely within Boston. For most of its history it has seen low levels of service. Starting in the early 2000 s, community pressure began to build for more stops and more frequent service. This eventually culminated in the construction of three new stations in city neighborhoods, the lowering of fares to equivalent to subway fares, more frequent service and eventually [...] by 2020 [...] a plan for operation of diesel multiple units on the line. Community action was crucial and significant to moving the project forward. The Fairmount Coalition [...] an alliance of nonprofits, advocacy organizations, community development corporation and others [...] played four major roles in the initiative: they drove the effort, employed legal tactics and strategies, maintained pressure and publicity on government agencies, and broadened the scope of the project from its initial narrow focus on transportation. To justify these major actions, however, community actors largely appealed to social justice, environmental justice and transit equity grounds, reasons that were not specific to commuter rail. The fact that it <b>focused</b> on commuter <b>rail</b> was most relevant when community actors claimed that residents had negative perceptions of commuter rail, bolstering the justice- and equity-based narrative of the effort. Otherwise, the fact that this project <b>focused</b> on commuter <b>rail</b> did not appear to {{have a significant impact on}} the project's strategies or success. by Andrew Lai. Thesis: M. C.

40|$|Regarding {{the quality}} of the time {{experienced}} at railways station, Dutch railway stations perform inferior. NS (the Dutch Railway Group), one of the major stakeholders in this development process, is ready to change this situation and recently declared that she is devoted to develop high quality railway stations which will satisfy the demands of the customer. Railway stations increasingly function as a place, besides the original node function, and become growingly important in stimulating inner city urban area developments. Future rail terminals will have to bring together transportation facilities, commercial development, and local activities that allow the congregation of all types of customers. Because of the relative novelty of the combination of functions in railway stations, knowledge about a founded design approach to achieve this future vision of a high quality railway station is absent. A theoretical support can help the current more practical trial and error approach of the NS to generate insight on the essential required design aspects. We focus thereby on a very specific part of the railway station: the rail terminal. The purpose of this research is to give insight in the essential design aspects of a successful customer <b>focused</b> <b>rail</b> terminal design, {{from the point of view}} of both travelers and shoppers. For this, we have conducted an in-depth literature research resulting in an analysis tool. This was input for an expert survey, filled in by 46 expert respondents. This article concludes with a prioritized list of design characteristics, together with possible conflicting aspects in the design of future multifunctional rail terminals...|$|R
