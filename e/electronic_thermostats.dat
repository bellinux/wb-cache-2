2500|$|To {{improve the}} comfort of the {{occupants}} of heated or air-conditioned spaces, bimetal sensor thermostats can include an [...] "anticipator" [...] system to slightly warm the temperature sensor while the heating equipment is operating, or to slightly warm the sensor when the cooling system is not operating.

2500|$|Thermostats use {{different}} types of sensors to measure the temperature. In one form, the mechanical thermostat, a bimetallic strip {{in the form of}} a coil directly operates electrical contacts that control the heating or cooling source. <b>Electronic</b> <b>thermostats,</b> instead, use a thermistor or other semiconductor sensor that requires amplification and processing to control the heating or cooling equipment (or even both, through the use of relays). A thermostat is an example of a [...] "bang-bang controller" [...] as the heating or cooling equipment output is not proportional to the difference between actual temperature and the temperature setpoint. Instead, the heating or cooling equipment runs at full capacity until the set temperature is reached, then shuts off. Increasing the difference between the thermostat setting and the desired temperature therefore does not change the time to achieve the desired temperature. The rate at which the target system temperature can change is determined both by the capacity of the heating or cooling equipment to respectively add or remove heat to or from a target system and the capacity of the target system to store heat.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Currently, {{hygienic}} {{conditions of}} public tableware and kitchenware {{have become a}} hot social concern. This work aimed at solving existing problems in detecting the presence of bacteria, a constant-temperature incubator for the paper strip method was designed and a related temperature-control system was developed. Firstly, the detection method and working principle of the incubator were elaborated upon. Using a paper strip, Escherichia coli (E. coli) was collected from the tableware to be examined. The paper strip was then placed in the incubator for a constant-temperature culture. Through chromogenic reaction, the hygienic condition of the tableware could be qualitatively and quantitatively assessed by analyzing the image information on the paper strip. Subsequently, {{with regard to the}} heater band, a wrapping pattern was designed and a suitable material was chosen. Three types of temperature sensors were compared, and a platinum resistor was finally selected and installed at the proper position. Additionally, an <b>electronic</b> <b>thermostat</b> was chosen. Conclusively, the designed incubator, which integrated the constant-temperature culture and image acquisition system, could detect the temperature accurately, reliably, and conveniently in real time, and could also detect the hygienic condition of public tableware rapidly and effectively.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} the {{proposal for the}} design of an intelligent <b>electronic</b> <b>thermostat</b> that achieves control by means of fuzzy logic, with the view of bringing about greater comfort by imitating human reasoning, and more efficient utilization of power. A cheap low cost microcontroller would be used for the implementation of this design. Ambient conditions that influence the perception of temperature serve as inputs to the thermostat and the output is automated and put into effect in temperature adjustment. Program development is to be broken into five parts namely fuzzification, inference, composition and defuzzification and this will be carried out using Inform ® software FuzzyTECH®. Automatic decision making of the controller is based on a set of rules generated by the program. After specifying the relationship between the inputs and outputs, a certain number of rules will be generated on which to base decision-making. The number of rules is likely to be high, which will make decision making unpredictable so the system has to be fine-tuned {{to reduce the number of}} rules. The behaviour of the thermostat based on the new set of rules generated, will demonstrate the ability of the thermostat to imitate human reasoning and save on power consumption...|$|R

40|$|Freezing depth is one {{the most}} {{important}} climatic parameters for indices applied in various fields such as agriculture and civil engineering. The parameter of freezing depth depends on different factors including astronomical, surface air temperature, humidity; soil characteristics such as texture, heat capacity, thermal conductivity and specific heat. This study investigated the effect of air temperature on freezing depth. Apparatus able to reach temperatures of - 16 ˚C {{was set up to}} test soil freezing points. To measure and record soil temperature at depths of 10, 20, 50, and 70 cm, an automatic measurement system was designed. The system’s sensors included an <b>electronic</b> <b>thermostat,</b> inserted at various different soil depths. Variations of temperature measured by the sensors were transferred to a transformer and these measurements were then transferred to a computer as binary codes. These codes were then processed by a computer program and converted to a numerical format. After calibration, several experiments were conducted using soil bins of different textures including clay, clay-sand and sand, at percentage moisture contents of 0, 10, and 15 %. Results of tests showed that freezing depth of soil in a dry state (0 % moisture content) for soil with smaller pores (such as clay) was less than that of soil with larger pores (such as sand). The advancing speed of the freezing front had a similar trend. By increasing soil moisture (0 % to 10 %), for all soil samples, the depth of freezing and the advancing speed of the freezing front increased. This condition was more pronounced in soil with finer texture than in soil with coarser texture. By increasing the amount of soil moisture content, clay soil maintained its moisture throughout depth, but in sandy and clay-sandy soil, the moisture content decreased from the top to the bottom (due to drainage). This phenomenon affected the advancing speed of the freezing front in these soil samples. Finally, the correlation between the time of soil freezing (t), and the temperature at different depths during the freezing process (T), was investigated, and it was concluded that this can be written in the form of{ }, significant at 1 % level for all three types of soil...|$|R

It is interesting to outline the timeliness and highly predicting power of these statements. In particular, we would like to point to the relevance of the question “What will the earth’s new skin permit us to feel? ” to the work we are going to discuss in this paper. There are many additional compelling questions, as for example: “How can the electronic earth’s skin be made more resilient?”; “How can the earth’s electronic skin be improved to better satisfy the need of our society?”;“What can the science of complex systems contribute to this endeavour?”...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{predict the}} {{existence}} of a thermal bistability in many-body systems out of thermal equilibrium which exchange heat by thermal radiation using insulator-metal transition materials. We propose a writing-reading procedure and demonstrate the possibility to exploit the thermal bistability to make a volatile thermal memory. We show that this thermal memory can be used to store heat and thermal information (via an encoding temperature) for arbitrary long times. The radiative thermal bistability could find broad applications in the domains of thermal management, information processing, and energy storage. The control of electric currents with diodes and transistors is undoubtedly a cornerstone in modern electronics which has revolutionized our daily life. Astonishingly, similar devices which allow for controlling the heat flow are not as widespread as their electronic counterparts. In 2006, Li et al. [1] proposed a thermal analog of a field-effect transistor by replacing both the electric potentials and the electric currents in the <b>electronic</b> circuits by <b>thermostats</b> and heat fluxes carried by phonons through solid segments. A few years later, several prototypes of phononic thermal logic gates [2] as well as thermal memories [3, 4] have been developed from these basic building blocks allowing for processing information with heat currents rather than with electric currents. However, this phonon-based technology is intrinsically limited by the speed of the heat carriers, the acoustic phonons, and by the presence of Kapitza resistances between the basic solid elements. Moreover, because of radiative losses and thermal fluctuations, the temporal stability of these systems is limited and a frequent refreshing is needed. To overcome these problems, optical con-tactless analogs of some basic devices such as the radiative thermal diode [5, 6] and the radiative transistor [7] have recently been introduced. However, some functionalities are, to date, missing to allow for an all-photonic treatment of heat fluxes. In this Letter, we make a step forward in this direction by introducing the concept of a radiative thermal memory which is able to store information for an arbitrary long time using thermal photons. To do so, we first demonstrate {{the existence of}} bistable thermal behavior in simple systems consisting of two membranes which are out of thermal equilibrium and which are further sandwiched between two thermal baths at different temperatures. The existence of multiple equilibrium temperatures requires [3] the presence of negative differential thermal resistances. However, as shown by Fan and co-workers [8], this is not at all a sufficient condition. As we will show, the thermal bistability mechanism can only exist in many-body systems [9 – 11]. Finally, as a direct consequence, we show that the bistability can be used to store one bit of thermal information. While, in a conventional electronic memory, the states 0 and 1 are defined by two different applied voltages for which the electric current inside the circuit is 0, its thermal counterpart is defined with distinct equilibrium temperatures which lead to vanishing heat fluxes between the different parts of the system. Let us consider a system as depicted in Fig. 1 composed by two parallel homogeneous membranes of finite thicknesses δ 1 and δ 2 and separated by a distance d. The left (right) membrane is in contact with a thermal bath having temperature T L (T R), where T L ≠ T R. In a practical point of view, the field radiated by these baths can be produced b...|$|R
