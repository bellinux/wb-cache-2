The purpose was to test the effectiveness of the lamp in irradiation using fluorene spiked solution as substrate. A 700 ml volume of fluorene solution of 0. 002 mg/l was irradiated batch-wise at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 48 h. The amount of fluorene removal was studied for fluorene solutions prepared from, neutral (distilled water), acidic (by adjusting pH with hydrochloric acid, HCl), basic (by adjusting pH with sodium hydroxide, NaOH) and saline (addition of sodium chloride, NaCl) solutions and there was 95. 95, 92. 35, 96. 65 and 97. 15 % removal respectively after 48 h of irradiation.

40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} {{positional}} isomerism on chemical and photochemical degradations of the Imazamethabenz-methyl (IMBM), a pesticide of the imidazolinone family, has been studied. IMBM is {{proposed in the}} form of a mixture of the two positional isomers: meta and para. The development of an effective HPLC method (resolution factor R = 1. 3) allows us to follow either the abiotic disappearance of the meta and para IMBM and the formation of their breakdown products. The abiotic degradation studies include the chemical hydrolysis, as well as the direct and the indirect photodecomposition. We used TiO 2, a well-known initiator of hydroxyl radicals, to highlight the role of. OH in the indirect photodegradation. This work confirms the different behaviours of positional isomers in the environment. Indeed the chemical or <b>direct</b> <b>photochemical</b> <b>degradation</b> is faster for the meta isomer than for the para. Whereas, concerning IMBM, there is not any prevalent influence of this type of isomerism on the indirect photochemical degradation.

By contrast, this review focuses on UV absorption, the first photochemical step in semiconductor photocatalysis. The influence of particle size on absorption and scattering of light by small TiO 2 particles is summarized {{and the importance of}} considering, the particle size in the application, not the BET or X-ray line broadening size, is emphasized. Three different consequences of UV absorption are then considered. First, two commercially important systems, pigmented polymer films and paints, are used to show that TiO 2 can protect from <b>direct</b> <b>photochemical</b> <b>degradation.</b> Then the effect of UV absorption on the measured photocatalytic degradation of aqueous solutions of organics is considered for two separate cases. Firstly, the consequences of UV absorption by TiO 2 on the generation of hydroxyl radicals from H 2 O 2 are considered {{in the context of the}} claimed synergy between H 2 O 2 and TiO 2. Secondly, the effect of altered UV absorption, caused by changed effective particle size of the catalyst, is demonstrated for photocatalysis of propan- 2 -ol oxidation and salicylic acid degradation...|$|E

The seasonal decline in Kduv was also accompanied by substantial increases in an absorption coefficient ratio (Q~,,~,,,: ud 36 snm) and decreases in spectral slopes (s). Experimental studies of <b>photochemical</b> <b>degradation</b> were also performed using filtered lake water and natural sunlight.

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{studied the}} <b>photochemical</b> and photoelectrochemical <b>degradation</b> of food dye (red dye-amaranth). The {{investigation}} {{aimed at the}} assessment of alternative treatments, focusing the use of clean technologies. The <b>photochemical</b> and photoelectrochemical <b>degradation</b> experiments were performed in a compartment with UV radiation (mercury lamp – 125 W). For the photoelectrochemical degradation, the best mathematical modelling indicated by the LAB Fit software was the exponential model. This behavior indicates a first-order reaction. On the other side, the best mathematical model for the <b>photochemical</b> <b>degradation</b> was the linear one. Therefore, the <b>photochemical</b> <b>degradation</b> indicates a zero-order reaction. For the amaranth dye, the photoelectrochemical method showed itself to be more efficient than the photochemical one. The photoelectrochemical treatment pointed to a 92 % color reduction in the dye solution, and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal reached up to 57 %.

40|$|<b>Photochemical</b> <b>degradation</b> of chromophoric-dissolved {{organic matter}} (CDOM) by UV-B {{radiation}} decreases CDOM absorption in the UV region and fluorescence intensity, and alters CDOM composition. CDOM absorption, fluorescence, and the spectral slope indicating the CDOM composition were studied using 0. 22 -μm-filtered samples of Meiliang Bay water from Lake Taihu that {{were exposed to}} short-term (0 – 12 h) simulated UV-B radiation and long-term (0 – 12 days) natural solar radiation in summer. CDOM absorption coefficient and fluorescence decreased with increasing exposure time, which relates to the amounts of absorbed light energy. The decreases of CDOM absorption and normalized fluorescence corresponded to first order kinetics reactions. Different decreases of CDOM absorption and fluorescence at different wavelengths suggested that the composition of CDOM changed when it absorbed ultraviolet radiation. <b>Photochemical</b> <b>degradation</b> increased the spectral slope during 275 – 295 nm region (S 275 – 295) but decreased the spectral slope during 275 – 295 nm region (S 350 – 400).

Iron oxides can facilitate these reactions, but their influence on subsequent organic products is poorly understood. Degradation experiments with billabong (= oxbow lake) water and river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) leaf leachate were conducted to assess {{the importance of these}} reactions in floodplain systems. <b>Photochemical</b> <b>degradation</b> of DOM in sunlight-irradiated quartz tubes (with and without amorphous iron oxide) was studied using gas chromatography and UV-visible spectroscopy.

Bioavailability of billabong DOM increased following irradiation, whereas that of leaf leachate was not significantly altered. Fluorescence excitation-emission spectra suggested that the humic component of billabong organic matter was particularly susceptible to degradation, and the source of DOM influenced the changes observed. The addition of amorphous iron oxide increased rates of <b>photochemical</b> <b>degradation</b> of leachate and billabong DOM.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the photodegradation {{rate of the}} powerful marine toxin domoic acid {{in a variety of}} natural water matrices. The observed first-order photodegradation rate coefficient (k obs), obtained by linear regression of the logarithmic-transformed domoic acid concentrations versus irradiation time in simulated sunlight, was 0. 15 � 0. 01 h � 1 in coastal seawater. Photodegradation rate coefficients in deionized water were not significantly different than those in coastal seawater, indicating that domoic acid is mainly photodegraded through a <b>direct</b> <b>photochemical</b> pathway. Addition of 100 nmol L � 1 spikes of iron III [Fe(III) ] and copper II [Cu(II) ] had no significant effect on domoic acid photodegradation, indicating that the formation of trace-metal chelates did not enhance photodegradation of the toxin in seawater. We observed an increase of domoic acid photodegradation rates with temperature with a corresponding energy of activation of 13 kJ mol � 1. The effect on photodegradation of pH, added humic material, and dissolved oxygen removal was also investigated. The quantum yield of domoic acid photodegradation in seawater decreased with increasing wavelength and decreasing energy of incoming radiation, with the average value ranging from 0. 03 to 0. 20 in the ultraviolet wavelength range (280 – 400 nm).

40|$|Atmospheric humic-like {{substance}} (HULIS) is {{an important}} fraction of water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) accounting for the light-absorbing properties of organic aerosols. HULIS is responsible for light-absorbing properties of organic aerosols in the atmosphere. Although various sources of HULIS have been studied extensively, its sinks are poorly constrained. In this study, we found seasonal changes in the optical and chemical characteristics of HULIS and WSOC, which are decreased by approximately 80  % and 30  %, respectively, from the cold season (Oct–Jan) to the warm season (Jun–Sep) due to enhanced solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The dominant role of <b>photochemical</b> <b>degradation</b> on light-absorbing organic aerosols, as a sink of HULIS, was further confirmed based on a laboratory experiment by evaluating impact of UV radiation on the optical properties of HULIS and WSOC contents. Our results suggest that seasonal variation of HULIS in WSOC is resulted mainly by photo-induced degradation in the atmosphere.
