The intent is that the combination of the tensioned tendons and the compressive roadbed box structure will keep the two <b>end</b> <b>caps</b> in the same relative position.|$|E

For example, styrene-butadiene block copolymers have a central polybutadiene chain with polystyrene <b>end</b> <b>caps.</b> When treated with OsO4, the butadiene matrix reacts preferentially and so absorbs the oxide. The presence of a heavy metal is sufficient to block the electron beam, so the polystyrene domains are seen clearly in thin films in TEM.|$|E
25|$|In a {{conventional}} design with a pressurized core, refuelling the system requires the core {{to shut down}} and the pressure vessel to be opened. Due to the arrangement used in CANDU, only the single tube being refuelled needs to be depressurized. This allows the CANDU system to be continually refuelled without shutting down, another major design goal. In modern systems, two robotic machines hook up to the reactor faces and open the <b>end</b> <b>caps</b> of a pressure tube. One machine pushes in the new fuel, whereby the depleted fuel is pushed out and collected at the other end. A significant operational advantage of online refuelling is that a failed or leaking fuel bundle can {{be removed from the}} core once it has been located, thus reducing the radiation levels in the primary cooling loop.|$|E
25|$|VAM's {{decision}} to focus all {{efforts on the}} new two-version Lerma model plus the loss of luxury accessories meant the discontinuation of Rally SST for 1982. The loss of the exemption of 500 units of automobile engines without emission certification forced the retirement of the Rally GT. The only model left for 1982 was the Rally AMX, with substantial differences from the previous two years. The taillight surrounding areas plus the headlight bezels and front hood molding were completely blacked out, the last two parts also having a horizontal red stripe passing from edge to edge. An all-new grille design with a horizontal bar {{at the same height}} of the bezels' division between the parking lights and headlights and a vertical bar at the very center; behind these was a set of smaller narrower horizontal lines. Both bumpers for the year were those of the AMC Eagle SX/4 Sport, being blacked out equipped with thick nerfing strips with central bright moldings and longer more aerodynamic bumper <b>end</b> <b>caps</b> with their respective bright molding. Unlike the previous two years, no decals or stickers of any kind were used. The standard wheel designs for the year were the eight spoke steel units with blacked out volcano hubcaps. Due to the impossibility of having the bullet-type door mirrors reproduced, the model switched to sporty design that was used in the 1978–1980 models. However, the remote controls for these mirrors while still available were moved to the option list. The Recaro-type seats received new patterns with a smaller bucket shape to allow an easier {{in and out of the}} car in the driver's side (due to the lack of a tilt steering column). The door panels were the same units as in 1981 except for the change in the fabric portion from plain to a pattern of vertical stripes and the removal of a fake chrome molding in place of a woodgrain unit. The six-bolt sports steering wheel was replaced by a leather-wrapped three-arm Nardi unit. VAM managed to find a local company to reproduce the center console, but it was reduced to the shifter and gauges portions, deleting the armrest with the rear ashtray. Despite the loss in accessories, two new options arrived for the year in the form of the AM FM stereo tape player radio and the rear wiper and washer. The car received two changes in the mid year, the first being a new wooden sports steering wheel and the second a new set of ten-round-spoke steel wheels. Mechanically, the only novelties for the year were wider gear ratios for the A998 automatic transmission and in the mid year a new head design with rounded internal intake ports and smaller spark plug outlets, still retaining the metal valve cover of the previous years. A different head gasket was used to bring the compression ratio from 8.0:1 to 8.5:1.|$|E

2500|$|The 1980 Eagle's {{appearance}} {{differed from}} the Concord's in that the bodies were raised [...] further off their suspension to afford better ground clearance. To fill in the increased visual space between the tires and wheel wells, AMC used durable Kraton (polymer) plastic wheelarch flares that flowed into rocker panel extensions. The grille {{was similar to the}} 1980 Concord's, but with the horizontal bars spaced slightly further apart, and the Eagle graphic mounted to the driver's side-center. Because coupes and sedans carried Concord DL equipment as standard, they also carried the Concord DL coupe and sedan roof treatments, featuring vinyl coverings, and opera windows. However, bumpers were pulled closer to the body than those seen on Concords, due to the Eagle having been classified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a light truck, and was therefore exempt from passenger car regulations that required front and rear bumpers that could sustain a [...] impact with no damage.

2500|$|The American Rally AMX {{was carried}} over for 1979 with {{substantial}} cosmetic changes {{that gave the}} model {{a higher level of}} originality within VAM and pushed it away from AMC's 1978 original. The body featured all-new side decal designs in two tones that were mostly straight and surrounded the side protective rubber moldings. The portion under the rear side windows grew thicker and housed an [...] "AMX over Rally" [...] decal using the same typography and design as the previous model, the legend [...] "AMX" [...] on top of the [...] "Rally" [...] one. All glass frames and moldings, volcano hubcaps, door mirrors, rocker panels and bumpers were blacked-out. AMC's dual quad headlight design with transparent parking lights was adopted alongside an in-house VAM sporty grille design with four horizontal bars shared with the Gremlin X and American 06/S models of the same year. Both bumpers were changed to the new smaller aluminum units with side <b>end</b> <b>caps,</b> bumper guards and nerfing strips. A unique feature of this model is the radio antenna placed on top of the passenger's side rear quarter panel, instead of the top of the right front fender.|$|E

The station wagon with automatic transmission obtained a new designation and became the Camioneta American DL. The American GFS got a treatment more similar to its AMC counterpart with {{the removal of the}} targa band retaining the Landau half-vinyl top. The side opera windows were changed to fixed units, which incorporated a unique VAM-designed sandblasted GFS emblem. Both the base and high-trim versions incorporated a shared new design of side panels, the only difference between them being a low carpet insert for the top-end models. All units with column-mounted shifters and automatic transmission obtained a new gear indicator integrated into the speedometer, replacing the previous unit fixed on top of the steering column. The flip-style digital clock was replaced by a quartz electronic one. The list of optional equipment was expanded with the possibility of ordering a monaural AM FM radio on the three high trim versions. For some reason, no wheelcovers were offered this year, thus the luxury editions incorporated bright narrow volcano hubcaps with VAM a logo and wheel trim rings. The custom steering wheel got a new design for the year with a soft rectangular button and tiny metal VAM emblem.|$|E
