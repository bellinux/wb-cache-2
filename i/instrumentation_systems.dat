5|$|The NTSB {{determined}} {{that the loss of}} one engine and the asymmetrical drag caused by damage to the wing's leading edge should not have been enough to cause the pilots to lose control of their aircraft; the aircraft should have been capable of returning to the airport using its remaining two engines. The NTSB thus examined the effects that the engine's separation would have on the aircraft's flight control, hydraulic, electrical, and <b>instrumentation</b> <b>systems.</b> Unlike other aircraft designs, the DC-10 did not include a separate mechanism to lock the extended leading edge slats in place, relying instead solely on the hydraulic pressure within the system. The NTSB {{determined that}} the engine tore through multiple hydraulic lines as it separated from the DC-10's wing, causing a loss of hydraulic pressure; airflow over the wings forced the left wing slats to retract, which caused a stall over the left wing. In response to the accident, slat relief valves were mandated to prevent slat retraction in case of hydraulic line damage.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — <b>Instrumentation</b> <b>system</b> of an {{underwater}} vehicle performs various {{functions such as}} sensing of physical parameters from different sensors, other sub systems and records into the memory. To assess {{the performance of the}} vehicle, data recorded by <b>instrumentation</b> <b>system</b> needs to be retrieved. In order to retrieve the data from the <b>Instrumentation</b> <b>system,</b> it needs to be powered on. The aim of the project is to develop a data retrieval station for <b>Instrumentation</b> <b>System</b> that can download data without powering on the <b>instrumentation</b> <b>system</b> or any other vehicle systems. Basically this system consists of two parts. One is Dual Interface EEPROM and the other is “portable RF reader/writer”.

40|$|An <b>instrumentation</b> <b>system</b> is a measurement-based {{performance}} evaluation abstraction. Management of an <b>instrumentation</b> <b>system</b> becomes critical when tracing is enabled on an application program that runs for an excessively {{long period of}} time. This paper presents queuing models for two <b>instrumentation</b> <b>system</b> management policies, namely, Flush One when it Fills (FOF) and Flush All when One Fills (FAOF). The performance results obtained analytically are compared to results obtained through trace-driven simulation. An appropriate <b>instrumentation</b> <b>system</b> management policy ensures optimal usage of the available local memory space to avoid excessive flushes of the local buffers or perturbation of the program behavior. The results show {{that each of the}} FOF and FAOF policies is suitable for one of these two objectives [...] the FAOF policy requires a smaller number of Pushes but with greater perturbation; the converse is true for the FOF policy. Therefore, a compromise between these two policies may be needed when implementing the <b>instrumentation</b> <b>system</b> management policy. ...|$|R

An <b>instrumentation</b> <b>system</b> (IS) {{is an integral part}} of any measurementbased parallel tool to collect runtime information from concurrent processes. However, software instrumentation is known to be intrusive and likely to change the behavior of application programs. Additionally, the <b>instrumentation</b> <b>system</b> is a part of the enabling technology of the tool and hence removed from the end-user. Therefore, it is important to evaluate its overheads at an early stage of tool development. We develop and parameterize a resource occupancy (ROCC) model for Paradyn IS on an IBM SP- 2 platform.

Habitation is a crucial aspect of human exploration, and a current focus of NASA activities. The Habitation Demonstration Unit (HDU) is a project focused on developing an autonomous habitation system that enables human exploration of space by providing engineers and scientists with a test bed to develop, integrate, test, and evaluate habitation systems. A critical feature of the HDU is the <b>instrumentation</b> <b>system,</b> which monitors key subsystems within the habitat. The following paper will discuss the HDU <b>instrumentation</b> <b>system</b> performance and lessons learned during the 2010 Desert Research and Technology Studies (D-RaTS). In addition, this paper will discuss {{the evolution of the}} <b>instrumentation</b> <b>system</b> to support the 2011 Deep Space Habitat configuration, the challenges, and the lessons learned of implementing this configuration. In 2010, the HDU was implemented as a pressurized excursion module (PEM) and was tested at NASA s D-RaTS in Arizona [1]. For this initial configuration, the <b>instrumentation</b> <b>system</b> design used features that were successful in previous habitat instrumentation projects, while also considering challenges, and implementing lessons learned [2].

The PEM <b>instrumentation</b> <b>system</b> monitored the HDU during field tests at D-RaTS, and the WSN data was later analyzed to understand the performance of this system.
