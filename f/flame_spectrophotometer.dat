5000|$|In 1967 and 1968 the MOS SGT {{transistors}} {{had good}} operating characteristics {{demonstrated by the}} C-V (capacitance-voltage) curves when first fabricated and tested, but then became degraded over time or when they were stressed under voltage or temperature, thus rendering them unusable. Gordon Moore, then head of Fairchild's R & D, assigned Andy Grove {{to the task of}} finding out why this promising technology was not working. The number of processing steps and types of solvents and materials used in processing of the semiconductor devices was quite large and any and all of them were suspects in giving off the contaminants, found eventually to be the mobile sodium ions, that might cause transistor C-V degradation because the concentration of the contaminants only had to be in the parts per billion (ppb) range. In order for Fairchild Semiconductor to effect the investigation of the source of the contaminants at such low concentrations they had to send many chemical and source samples to Union Carbide which had the type of equipment to detect such small amounts (neutron activation or mass Spectrography) but this was prohibitively expensive and slow to do with the many samples they had, frustrating and delaying the investigation. As the manager of Fairchild R & D's Chemical Analysis Lab, Bernard invented special techniques and modifications to use less expensive equipment (<b>Flame</b> <b>Spectrophotometer</b> [...] ) to perform the necessary analysis of the many samples ( [...] down to 1 ppb or less [...] ) and published this work in the paper titled [...] "A Method for Determining Sodium Content of Semiconductor Processing Materials" [...] in the Journal of the Electrochemical society in 1968.

40|$|A {{study was}} made of the {{radioactivity}} and petrology of specimens from nine areas in northern Saskatchewan. The specimens studied ranged in composition from granite and pegmatite to diorite, and represented both areas of radioactive mineralization and areas of no known radioactive mineralization. It was found that structure was the most important control for ractioactivity with the highest radioactivity being confined to the margins of the granitic bodies. In two of the areas studied there is a direct relationship between the radioactivity and the microcline content of the rocks. The explanation suggested for this is that both are deposited by the last phase of the megmatic solutions. A general hypothesis is suggested that the granites from areas of radioactive mineralization are pronouncedly more radioactive than granites from areas of no radioactive mineralization. The study of the composition of plagioclase from radioactive pegmatites of Charlebois Lake with the <b>flame</b> <b>spectrophotometer</b> when compared with the optical determinations gave inconclusive results.

40|$|The {{sodium ion}} {{electrode}} {{can also be}} used to indicate steam entrainment in the extraction samples. Starting with a low flow, the voltage indicated by the ion analyzer is noted. The sample flow rate is then increased, while monitoring the ion analyzer. The voltage will remain constant as long as only water is being sampled. A change in voltage indicates steam entrainment, and the sample flow rate should be decreased. From this discussion it can be seen that completely adequate instrumentation is available for implementation of the sodium tracer technique. I t should be noted that the high-quality spectrophotometer is not an uncommon instrument, since it is found in most PWR plants. Summary The ease and practicability of using nonradioactive sodium as a tracer in testing saturated steam turbine-generators in PWR cycles has been demonstrated.

The kalemic systems, in those breeds were characterized by a polymorphism of middle level due {{to the existence of}} the two phenotypes and of three genotypes. The polymorphic character of this system is given by the distributional discontinuity of potassium ions in whole blood, the discontinuous space ranging were 10 - 34 m eq/L in the Mongolian native breed, 0. 38 - 20. 3 m eq/L in the Govigurbansaihan breed, 10. 27 - 15. 8 m eq / L in the AltainUlaan sub breed.

The correlation of the trait was also high r= 0. 57 between these breeds. The animals with potassium ion concentration below the discontinuity space are of LK type and those with ionic concentration above the discontinuity space are of HK type.

40|$|Alginate is one the {{materials}} most employed in practice to make dental impressions. Substances like zinc, {{cadmium and lead}} silicate, which are included in several alginate brands {{with the aim of}} improving their physical, chemical and mechanical properties, are a source of serious concern as regards their toxicity. The most serious chronic effect of oral exposure to cadmium is renal toxicity. Assimilation of lead has deleterious effects on the gastrointestinal tract, hematopoietic system, cardiovascular system, central and peripheral nervous systems, kidneys, immune system, and reproductive system. Chronic oral exposures to zinc have resulted in hypochromic and microcyte anemia in some individuals. The aim {{of the present study was}} to measure the cadmium, lead and zinc contents of seven brands of alginate for dental use on sale in Brazil. The samples were weighed and placed in the Teflon cups of a closed-system microwave oven. Aqua regia (4 mL concentrated HCI:HNO 3, 3 : 1 v/v) and hydrofluoric acid (2 mL concentrated HF) were added to the samples, which were then subjected to heating. The samples were then cooled to room temperature and diluted to 25 mL in deionized water in a volumetric glass flask. The samples were diluted in duplicate and analyzed against a reagent blank.

Measurements and scale samples were taken from commercially-caught fish and fish caught in the ORNL tagging operations. Scale impressions were anaiyzed for age and growth phenomena. Dispersion of smallmouth buffalo was investigated by conventional of ging methods and by autoradiographic analyses of scales. Stable and radiochemicsl composition of scales was examined by spectrographic analysis, <b>flame</b> <b>spectrophotometer</b> and radiometric surveys. Calcium was the most abundance element in fish scales with at lease twenty-three other elements present in varying quantities. Fish scaless and bone were found to contain radionuclides of ruthenium, cesium, zirconium, zinc, and cobalt. Radiometric surveys of scales revealed the Watts Bar Reservoir smallmouth buffalo population was a relatively minor accumulator of radionuclides with only 0. 08 per cent showing the presence of artificially produced radionuclides. Approximately 6 per cent of the Clinch River fish and 77 per cent of the White Oak Creek fish had accumulations. Limited data on dispersion were determined from conventional tags. Much more dispersion and life history data were determined from autoradiographic analyses of scales. These dispersion data were applied only to individuals because the number was too small for generalizations for {{the population as a}} whole. All normal scales containing radionuclide accumulations were found to produce identical autoradiographic patterns of concentric circles which were associated with growth of the fish in contaminated areas. This phenomenon was combined with conventional capture-recapture methods of population estimates in a proposed technique of population studies. A laboratory experiment showed that scales could be tagged with cesium- 134, but this radionuclide was found to accumulate in much larger concentrations in the soft tissues than in the bony tissues.
