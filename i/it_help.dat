Yeats appeared to have persuaded himself that Olivia and her cousin shared a flaw, writing, [...] "here is the same weakness I thought... Her beauty... dark and still, had the nobility of defeated things, and how could <b>it</b> <b>help</b> but wring my heart. I took a fortnight to decide what I should do". He constructed a plan to reconcile his desire with what he believed to be her wickedness: he would ask that she leave her husband to live with him. Until then their friendship would remain platonic.|$|E

But we had to ask ourselves, does <b>it</b> <b>help</b> our story? No." [...] Footage that was nearly edited out included a scene where Anwar had to siphon petrol out of the family car for the house's generator. Anwar explained to the camera that he needed to do it because their family was so poor. [...] "That's tough", commented Water, [...] "because that's a dishonour to his family." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{book also}} {{explains}} {{the philosophy of}} social determinism held by those Dalrymple interviewed, and how the welfare state and the socialist tenets within <b>it</b> <b>help</b> feed this mindset. However, Dalrymple never directly accuses socialism and the welfare state in his essays, instead focusing on the beliefs and reasons for why the patients and inmates take the destructive actions that they did. This is expressed with determinism in {{that they believe that}} their actions must be based on their childhoods or the failure of society in the past to help them. Those patients that Dalrymple speaks with [...] "seem surprised and tell him that he's the first person they've ever talked to who suggests that they can change their lives for the better," [...] further emphasising the mindset in which their society has placed them.|$|E

500|$|The {{research}} from the MAUD committee was compiled in two reports, {{commonly known as the}} MAUD reports in July 1941. The first report, [...] "Use of Uranium for a Bomb", discussed the feasibility of creating a super-bomb from uranium, which they now thought to be true. The second, [...] "Use of Uranium as a Source of Power" [...] discussed the idea of using uranium as a source of power, not just a bomb. The MAUD Committee and report helped bring about the British nuclear program, the Tube Alloys Project. Not only did <b>it</b> <b>help</b> start a nuclear project in Britain but it helped jump-start the American project. Without the help of the MAUD Committee the American program, the Manhattan Project, would have started months behind. Instead they were able to begin thinking about how to create a bomb, not whether it was possible. Historian Margaret Gowing noted that [...] "events that change a time scale by only a few months can nevertheless change history." ...|$|E
500|$|Opposition to {{this plan}} was immediate. Yonkers {{officials}} publicly disapproved, {{saying that the}} county would lose any hope for state aid. In January 1939, the village of Bronxville joined the opposition, deeming the new parkway as a [...] "needless expenditure of public money" [...] that would adversely affect local property values and cause flooding. At the same time, proposals {{in the state legislature}} provided a sum of $25,000 for the project. County executive William Bleakley said that a new parkway should be built, but not so close to the Saw Mill River and Bronx River parkways. He argued instead for the use of New York Central Railroad's right-of-way, or a parkway on the Hudson River. There were also fears a new parkway would siphon off toll-paying drivers who previously used the Cross County Parkway and its new Fleetwood Viaduct. Nor would <b>it</b> <b>help</b> the county's largest bottleneck, the Hawthorne Circle. The county's Board of Supervisors, however, disagreed with the executive.|$|E
500|$|Bush's {{method of}} {{management}} at the OSRD was to direct overall policy, while delegating supervision of divisions to qualified colleagues and letting them do their jobs without interference. He attempted to interpret {{the mandate of the}} OSRD as narrowly as possible to avoid overtaxing his office and to prevent duplicating the efforts of other agencies. Bush would often ask: [...] "Will <b>it</b> <b>help</b> to win a war; this war?" [...] Other challenges involved obtaining adequate funds from the president and Congress and determining apportionment of research among government, academic, and industrial facilities. His most difficult problems, and also greatest successes, were keeping the confidence of the military, which distrusted the ability of civilians to observe security regulations and devise practical solutions, and opposing conscription of young scientists into the armed forces. This became especially difficult as the army's manpower crisis really began to bite in 1944. In all, the OSRD requested deferments for some 9,725 employees of OSRD contractors, of which all but 63 were granted. In his obituary, The New York Times described Bush as [...] "a master craftsman at steering around obstacles, whether they were technical or political or bull-headed generals and admirals." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{the second}} half of 2014, the Greek {{government}} again negotiated with the Troika. The negotiations were this time about how to comply with the programme requirements, to ensure activation of the payment of its last scheduled eurozone bailout tranche in December 2014, and about a potential update of its remaining bailout programme for 2015–16. When calculating the impact of the 2015 fiscal budget presented by the Greek government, there was a disagreement, with the calculations of the Greek government showing it fully complied with the goals of its agreed [...] "Midterm fiscal plan 2013–16", while the Troika calculations were less optimistic and returned a not covered financing gap at €2.5bn (being required to be covered by additional austerity measures). As the Greek government insisted their calculations were more accurate than those presented by the Troika, they submitted an unchanged fiscal budget bill on 21 November, to be voted for by the parliament on 7 December. The Eurogroup was scheduled to meet and discuss the updated review of the Greek bailout programme on 8 December (to be published on the same day), and the potential adjustments to the remaining programme for 2015–16. There were rumours in the press that the Greek government has proposed immediately to end the previously agreed and continuing IMF bailout programme for 2015–16, replacing it with the transfer of €11bn unused bank recapitalization funds currently held as reserve by the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF), along with establishment of a new precautionary Enhanced Conditions Credit Line (ECCL) issued by the European Stability Mechanism. The ECCL instrument is often used as a follow-up precautionary measure, when a state has exited its sovereign bailout programme, with transfers only taking place if adverse financial/economic circumstances materialize, but with the positive effect that <b>it</b> <b>help</b> calm down financial markets as the presence of this extra backup guarantee mechanism makes the environment safer for investors.|$|E
