25|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, the {{influence}} of American and Swedish death metal bands was quickly evident. Many of the thrash bands of the 1980s had disbanded and heavier groups were beginning to fill the void, such as Necrotomy, Acheron, Disembowlment, Corpse Molestation, Damnatory, Hecatomb, Damaged, Anatomy and Blood Duster in Melbourne, Dreamkillers, Obfuscate Mass, Misery and Mausoleum in Brisbane, Aftermath, Apostasy and Cruciform from Sydney and Psychrist and Alchemist from Canberra. Perhaps due to magazines like Hot Metal and the occasional exposure to extreme metal on some community radio programs, bands like these were appearing at a high rate. Shock Records, the Melbourne independent label, commissioned a compilation album to highlight some of these new acts. Come to <b>Daddy</b> <b>was</b> released in 1992 and compiled by Hot Metal writer Ian McFarlane; it contained 14 tracks from bands like Necrotomy, Mausoleum, Mystic Insight, Deracination, Obfuscate Mass, Misery, Discarnated, Entasis, iNFeCTeD, Open Festering Wounds, and Persecution. When McFarlane went to Roadrunner Records' Australian office the following year, he put together another compilation, Redrum, collecting tracks from another group of completely different bands like Alchemist, Sadistik Exekution, Frozen Doberman, Allegiance and Hecatomb.|$|E

500|$|After Underwood's Play On Tour {{wrapped in}} December 2010, {{she started to}} work on her fourth studio album, which was then untitled. Sony Music Nashville chairman/CEO Gary Overton said that the singer [...] "took nearly a year to compile and record the songs." [...] Songwriters Chris Tompkins and Josh Kear, who {{previously}} wrote [...] "Before He Cheats" [...] for Underwood's debut album, Some Hearts (2005), worked on [...] "Blown Away" [...] initially without a specific artist in mind. At first, they built the drums and the string parts that of the introduction and verses. Tompkins started playing his keyboard to find sound effects for the introduction, and ended up using one that was a thunderstorm. [...] "I think that's what kind of threw us into it. We just started writing it," [...] he said. The songwriters then {{came up with the}} first verse of the song: [...] "Dry lighting cracks across the skies / Those storm clouds gather in her eyes / Her <b>daddy</b> <b>was</b> a mean old mister / Momma was an angel in the ground / The weatherman called for a twister / She prayed blow it down." [...] Kear commented that it was not the duo's intent or goal to make it a dark, revenge-themed song. As they wrote the pre-chorus line [...] "not enough rain in Oklahoma", both knew that it was a Carrie Underwood song, as the singer is from that state. [...] "We knew if we stuck with that lyric [...] it was Carrie's song or maybe no one would ever record it," [...] Kear commented. After the theme of the song had been established, the songwriters wanted to [...] "dig up as much drama as [...] could." [...] Lyrically, [...] "Blown Away" [...] {{tells the story of a}} daughter locking herself in a storm cellar while her alcoholic father is passed out on the couch in the path of a tornado. Underwood revealed that [...] "Blown Away" [...] was the song that defined the direction of the album, and recalled the first time she heard the demo: ...|$|E

2500|$|Many {{other musicians}} have {{mentioned}} Daleks in lyrics, including: the Clash, in [...] "Remote Control" [...] ("Repression—gonna be a Dalek / Repression—I am a robot / Repression—I obey."); the Creatures, in [...] "Weathercade" [...] ("The Dalek drones are drowning"); Martin Gordon in [...] "Her <b>Daddy</b> <b>Was</b> a Dalek, Her Mummy Was a Non-Stick Frying Pan" [...] from his album [...] "The Joy of More Hogwash" [...] and the Supernaturals, in [...] "Smile" [...] ("I {{feel like a}} Dalek inside/ Everything's gone grey but {{used to be so}} black and white").

Bands have even incorporated Daleks into their names: Dalek I Love You, a synthpop band active for over ten years from the late 1970s {{to the beginning of the}} 1990s, and instrumental surf-rock trio Dalek Beach Party, whose 1992 EP featured the song [...] "Exterminate!

2500|$|It {{was also}} in 1987 that Orbison began collaborating with Electric Light Orchestra lead vocalist and bandleader Jeff Lynne on a new album. Concurrently, Lynne was {{completing}} production work on George Harrison's Cloud Nine album, and all three ate lunch together one day when Orbison accepted an invitation to sing on a song of Harrison's. They subsequently contacted Bob Dylan, who, in turn, allowed them to use a recording studio in his home. Along the way, Harrison made a quick visit to Tom Petty's residence to obtain his guitar; Petty and his band had backed Dylan on his last tour. By that evening, the group had written [...] "Handle with Care", {{which led to the}} concept of recording an entire album. They called themselves the Traveling Wilburys, representing themselves as half-brothers with the same father. They gave themselves stage names; Orbison chose his from his musical hero, calling himself [...] "Lefty Wilbury" [...] after Lefty Frizzell. Expanding on the concept of a traveling band of raucous musicians, Orbison offered a quote about the group's foundation in honor: [...] "Some people say <b>Daddy</b> <b>was</b> a cad and a bounder.
