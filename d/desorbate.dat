40|$|Lysozyme (muramidase) is a {{well known}} {{antibacterial}} biopolymer {{which can be used}} in pharmaceutical and food technology. Synthesized carboxylic ion-exchanger on the base of acrylic monomers was used in experiments for lysozyme sorption study from model solutions. Ionization of ion-exchanger functional groups was studied by potentiometric titration in 0. 1 M and 1. 0 M NaCl solution. The results were correlated with the influence of solution ionic strength on sorption of lysozyme at different pH values. The data obtained suggested to choose desorption condition. Lytic activity of lysozyme in desorbates was evaluated using Micrococcus lysodeiktikus lyophilized cells. The results testified high recovery of lysozyme using macroreticular poly(methacrylic acid-co-acrylic acid) ter-polymeric ion-exchanger and preservation of enzymatic activity of lysozyme in <b>desorbate...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the photodesorption process of diatomic molecules from oxide surfaces. As different systems are considered, it is divided with respect to the <b>desorbate</b> motional degree of freedom. Stereodynamical effects of CO-molecules desorbing from a chromiumoxide surface are treated within the category of rotational excitation. A DIET (Desorption Induced by Electronic Transitions) process is simulated, taking into account a two state model which includes the electronic ground state and an electronically excited state of the adsorbate-substrate system. The potential energy surfaces for the two states involved were obtained by ab initio calculations, the excited state is based on an internal CO excitation. A stochastic wavepacket approach is applied in three dimensions (one distance coordinate and two angular degrees of freedom) and yields mechanistic insight into the desorption process. The rotational alignment of the desorbing CO-molecules is understood by considering both the electronic ground and excited state topology. The wave packet calculations demonstrate the importance of a high-dimensional treatment of photodesorption from surfaces. Within the category of vibrational excitation ab initio and wave packet calculations with the intention of simulating the vibrational excitation of NO desorbing from a NiO(100) surface after laser irradiation are reported. Quantitative agreement between experimental and theoretical vibrational state populations is obtained if the electrostatic field of the positively charged surface is taken into account. This field leads to a considerable shortening of the equilibrium bond lenght of the anionic intermediate, whereas the equilibrium distance of the neutral NO-molecule is nearly unaffected. The role of the thermal population of the molecule-surface vibration is studied using a model potential adopted to the system NO on chromiumoxide. Calculations are performed concerning the temperature dependence of the desorption yield and of the velocity distributions after laser induced desorption. Furthermore, the thesis includes a discussion of the numerical treatment of angular coordinates and {{a detailed description of the}} highdimensional wavepacket code. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{outgassing}} {{characteristics of}} specimens of the EGCR moderator graphite stock were determined in vacuo {{to a maximum}} temperature of 1000 deg C using external resistance heating and to 1800 deg C by induction heating. The specimens examined were cut from several locations {{in two of the}} 18 -in. x 18 -in. x 20 -ft graphite bars which had been prepared under fabrication conditions comparable to those used for the graphite columns present in the Experimental Gas- Cooled Reactor. Data are given which show the effect of the position of sampling of the bars on the density of the graphite. The volume and composition of <b>desorbates</b> obtained at 300, 600, and 1000 deg C as a function of specimen size and position of specimen within the bars also are given. The volume-time relationships at 300 and 600 deg C can be expressed satisfactorily by v = A log t + B over extended intervals of time. A linear relationship prevails at 1000 deg C only after heating for longer than approximates 800 min. The volume and composition of the <b>desorbates</b> obtained at 1000, 1400, and 1800 deg C using induction heating are tabulated. (auth...|$|R

Enzymatic activity of lysozyme containing solutions was evaluated by Micrococcus lysodeiktikus cell lysis. Reversibly conjugated lysozyme release was ascertained {{to depend on}} the contacted medium composition. Lysozyme release from conjugates was stable for the duration of experiment (11 days). To evaluate the stability of conjugate over time, samples were stored at ambient temperature for 72 days.

40|$|This study focusses {{attention}} on the possibilities of preparative isotachophoresis (ITP) as a sample pretreatment technique prior to liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analysis. The increased demand for accurate and less time consuming analysis necessitates that sample pretreatment procedures, should be develop in parallel with other improvements (e. g. in detection and separation) which can be observed. The preparation isotachophoresis was performed on gel slabs and the zones of interest were subsequently cut out, desorbed and the <b>desorbates</b> analyzed by HPLC. In this study satisfactory recoveries of between 85 – 90 % {{with a standard deviation}} of 1 – 5 % were observed for blank experiments. For spiked serum and urine samples the recoveries in general decreased with decreasing spiked drug concentrations. These observations are discussed in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Interactions {{between the}} ambient {{atmosphere}} and orbiting spacecraft, sounding rockets, and suborbital vehicles, {{and with their}} effluents, give rise to optical (extreme UV to LWIR) foreground radiation which constitutes noise that raises the detection threshold for terrestrial and celestial radiations, as well as military targets. Researchers review the current information on the on-orbit optical contamination. Its source species are created in interaction processes that can be grouped into three categories: (1) Reactions in the gas phase between the ambient atmosphere and <b>desorbates</b> and exhaust; (2) Reactions catalyzed by exposed ram surfaces, which occur spontaneously {{even in the absence}} of active material releases from the vehicles; and (3) Erosive excitative reactions with exposed bulk (organic) materials, which have recently been identified in the laboratory though not as yet observed on spacecraft. Researchers also assess the effect of optical pumping by earthshine and sunlight of both reaction products and effluents...|$|R
40|$|The {{deposition}} of hydrocarbons on silicon substrates {{is a topic}} of wide interest. This is generally related to the technological importance of silicon carbide (SiC) and a growing interest in graphene and graphitic materials. Methods for producing these materials predominantly involve high processing temperatures. In the case of SiC, these high processing temperatures often result {{in the formation of}} surface defects, which compromise the electronic properties of the material. In an effort to grow SiC films at low temperatures, a technique known as electron-beam chemical vapor deposition (EBCVD) has been developed. Most electron beam deposition techniques employ a focused beam of high-energy (20 - 30 keV) electrons to form nanometer-sized solid deposits on a surface. However, in an effort to deposit macroscale films, a broad beam of low-energy electrons was used. In addition to investigating the applications of low-energy electrons in semiconductor film growth, the fundamental chemical and physical processes induced by the bombardment of adsorbate-covered surfaces with low-energy electrons were examined. Specifically, the electron-stimulated desorption of various adsorbate-substrate systems such as acetylene adsorbed on silicon, graphene oxide on silicon, and ultrathin graphite films on silicon carbide have been investigated. The yields of cation and neutral <b>desorbates</b> as a function incident electron energy were measured, appearance thresholds were determined and mechanisms of desorption were proposed. Ph. D.

40|$|In the {{irradiation}} of condensed phases at high laser irradiances, the ejection/removal {{of a high}} {{quantity of}} material is observed, and this is usually denoted by the term laser pulsed ablation (or explosive desorption). This phenomenon has found extensive and very important applications, but its mechanistic understanding is very poor. The present work addresses two questions: Can a physically significant criterion be established for defining the phenomenon? How physical and chemical processes in this regime differ from those at low light irradiances where conventional photophysics/chemistry holds? To address these questions, model systems composed of simple organic compounds frozen at low tempeartures are studied. Time-of-flight mass spectrometry is employed to probe ejection efficiencies {{as a function of}} laser parameters and optical/imaging techniques are employed for probing morphological/structural changes induced in the film. Through the comparative examination of nonabsorbing dopants of different binding energies to the matrix (C 6 H 5 CH 3), it is demonstrated hat in the UV irradiation, two fluence ranges can be delineated where different material ejection mechanisms operate. At low fluences, ejection is consistent with surface vaporization/desorption, whereas at higher fluences, ejection is clearly different, entailing the unselective ejection of a volume of material. Therefore, the term ablation should be employed for denoting exclusively this higher fluence range. This differentiation has important implications for the applications of ablation. The ejection of dopants strongly-bound to the matrix is established as a direct experimental criterion for the identification of ablative regime. By the use of optical techniques, film melting and gas bubble formation is demonstrated below the threshold. Consequently, ablation of molecular solids with nanosecond pulses is due to explosive boiling. Besides the implications for ablation, this demonstration may provide new ways for studying organic compounds in metastable states. The translational distributions of the ejected <b>desorbates</b> in the UV irradiation are shown to exhibit distinctly different dependences above vs. below the threshold. In contrast to most models, in the ablation regime they are shown to be determined by the gas phase collisional dynamics and the ejection process, as well. A number of additional features are determined that can provide the basis for the development of more elaborate theoretical models on the flow dynamics of the ejected material. The photochemical processes are studied for prototypical organic compound (C 6 H 5 Cl). It is shown that UV ablation does not modify qualitatively the reactivity patterns. However, quantitatively, significant deviations from conventional kinetics are noted, suggesting that the description of reactivity in UV ablation requires consideration of the parallel influence of the thermal and physical processes. In particular, product formation is shown to occur mainly in the film and as a result, photolysis yields and photoproduct formation efficiencies depend critically on the time scale of material ejection. Finally, preliminary studies on the femtosecond irradiation of these systems show significant differentiations from the nanosecond case, suggesting that laser pulse width is crucial for the desorption and ablation ejection processes...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} involves two projects: a surface science {{study of the}} room-temperature adsorption and thermal evolution of allylamine and ethanolamine on Si(100) 2 × 1, studied by using temperature-dependent X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and thermal desorption spectrometry (TDS), as well as Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations; and a materials science study on the shape control of copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) deposited on H-terminated Si(100) substrate with an extended size regime of 5 - 400 nm, by using a simple, one-step electrochemical method. The Cu NPs of three primary shapes were characterized with scanning-electron microscopy (SEM), glancing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) and XPS. In the first surface science study, the presence of broad N 1 s XPS features at 398. 9 - 399. 1 eV, corresponding to N–Si bonds, indicates N–H dissociative adsorption for both allylamine and ethanolamine on Si(100) 2 × 1. For allylamine, the presence of C 1 s features at 284. 6 eV and 286. 2 eV, corresponding to C=C and C−N, respectively, {{and the absence of}} the Si−C feature expected at 283. 5 eV show that the reactions involving the ethenyl group such as the [2 + 2] C=C cycloaddition or those producing the [N, C, C] tridentate adstructures do not occur at room temperature. For ethanolamine, the O 1 s feature at 533. 1 eV indicates the formation of Si−O bond and O−H dissociation, which confirms an [O, N] bidentate adstructure and excludes the N−H and O−H dissociation unidentate structures. These XPS data are consistent with the N−H unidentate, and N−H and O−H double dissociation [O, N] bidentate adstructures for allylamine and ethanolamine, respectively, as predicted by the DFT calculations. TDS and temperature-dependent XPS data further show the desorption of propene and ethylene at 580 K and of acetylene at 700 K for allylamine and the desorption of ethylene at 615 K for ethanolamine, while the lack of N- or O-containing <b>desorbates</b> suggests that the dissociated N and O species are likely bonded to multiple surface Si atoms or diffused into the bulk at elevated temperatures (as confirmed by the corresponding temperature-dependent XPS spectra). Unlike the multidentate allyl alcohol and allylamine adstructures that {{have been found to be}} not favored kinetically, the present [O, N] bidentate ethanolamine adstructure appears to be kinetically favored on Si(100) 2 × 1. In the second materials science study, Cu NPs of three primary shapes have been deposited on H-terminated Si(100) by a simple, one-step electrochemical method. By precisely manipulating the electrolyte concentration [CuSO 4. 5 H 2 O] below their respective critical values, cubic, cuboctahedral, and octahedral Cu NPs of ranges of average sizes and number densities can be easily obtained by varying the deposition time. Combined GIXRD and depth-profiling XPS studies show that these Cu NPs have a crystalline core-shell structure, with a face-centered cubic metallic Cu core and a simple cubic Cu 2 O shell with a CuO outerlayer. The shape control of Cu NPs can be understood in terms of a progressive growth model under different kinetic conditions as dictated by different [CuSO 4. 5 H 2 O] concentration regimes. The two studies in the present work lay the foundation for future investigation of surface biofunctionalization of these fascinating Cu NPs with different shapes and therefore different surface chemistries as controlled by the relative amounts of the (100) and (111) facets, and their boundaries...|$|R
