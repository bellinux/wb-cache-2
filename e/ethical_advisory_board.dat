30|$|The {{research}} presented herein {{was conducted}} {{as part of}} an ERC-funded project entitled ‘Intimate Encounters in European Borderlands: Migrant Motherhood, Sovereignty, and the Politics of Care on Europe’s Periphery’ (EU Border Care) lead by Professor Vanessa Grotti and based at the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies, EUI. The project’s ethical and data management and protection protocol was designed in collaboration with the ERCEA’s Ethics experts monitoring the project, and submitted to the ERCEA’s Independent Ethical Review Committee for review and approval. The project is also reviewed and assessed by the ERCEA at regular intervals to ensure ethical standards are upheld, and holds regular meetings with its <b>Ethical</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>Board</b> to discuss protocols and standards. EU Border Care has also been approved by the EUI’s ethical review committee. EU Border Care also benefits from the support of its <b>Ethical</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>Board,</b> constituted of academics, clinicians, and legal experts. Regular workshops and meetings are organised with board members to ensure ethical standards are maintained throughout the project.|$|E
40|$|This article {{provides}} an intellectual archeology {{of how the}} term “respect” has functioned {{in the field of}} bioethics. I argue that over time the function of the term has shifted, with a significant turning point occurring in 1979. Prior to 1979, the term “respect” connoted primarily the notion of “respect for persons” which functioned as an umbrella which conferred protection to autonomous persons and those with compromised autonomy. But in 1979, with the First Edition of Principles of Biomedical Ethics by Beauchamp and Childress, and the report of the <b>Ethical</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>Board</b> (EAB) of the (then) Department of Health, Education, and Welfare entitled Research on In Vitro Fertilization, usage shifts from “respect for persons” to “respect for autonomy. ” Two results: 1) those with compromised autonomy are no longer protected by the canons of “respect” but rather the less overriding canons of beneficence; and 2) the term “respect” functions increasingly as a rhetorical device in public bioethics discourse...|$|E
40|$|Developers and {{designers}} make {{all sorts of}} moral decisions throughout an innovation project. In this article, we describe how teams of developers {{and designers}} engaged with ethics in the early phases of innovation based on case studies in the SUBCOP project (SUBCOP stands for 'SUicide Bomber COunteraction and Prevention'). For that purpose, Value Sensitive Design (VSD) {{will be used as}} a reference. Specifically, we focus on the following two research questions: How can researchers/developers learn about users’ perspectives and values during the innovation process? and How can researchers/developers take into account these values, and related design criteria, in their decision-making during the innovation process? Based on a case study of several innovation processes in this project, we conclude the researchers/developers involved are able to do something similar to VSD (without them knowing about VSD or calling it 'VSD'), supported by relatively simple exercises in the project, e. g., meetings with potential end-users and discussions with members of the <b>Ethical</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>Board</b> of the project. Furthermore, we also found—possibly somewhat counterintuitively—that a commercial, with its focus on understanding and satisfying customers' needs, can promote VSD...|$|E

40|$|Disease Control {{are seeking}} ethical guid-ance about the {{rationing}} of flu shots this year (“Ethicists to guide rationing of flu vaccine, ” J. Couzin, News of the Week, 5 Nov., p. 960). They {{should also be}} seeking {{ways to reduce the}} scientific uncertainties that make this ethical question difficult. For example, how effective is the influenza vaccine in different age groups, and in preventing disease, mortality, and risk of transmitting to others? How much benefit do hospital patients or nursing home residents receive through reduced risk of transmission if the staff of these institutions are vaccinated, compared with the benefits of being vaccinated themselves? Surely the answers to these ques-tions are important inputs to the ethical calculus, and existing data are not adequate to answer them. Attempts to solve this short-term ethical problem should not obscure the larger failures that led to it. It has been common knowledge for years that the influenza vaccine supply was fragile at best, and no serious effort has been made to ensure a safe and plentiful supply. This failure also increases the risk of delays and and limited supplies of the new vaccine that will be required for a pandemic. Other pandemic preparedness activities, including surveillance for new strains in Asia, are seri-ously underfunded. Big failures of policy and politics have led to ethical dilemmas that would not otherwise have existed. While offering their guidance for the short term, perhaps the <b>ethical</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>board</b> can also high-light the ethical and other benefits of taking actions to minimize the likelihood of rationing in the future...|$|E
50|$|Size of an <b>advisory</b> <b>board</b> {{influences}} {{the efficiency of}} delivering ongoing information and effectiveness of organizing board meetings.
