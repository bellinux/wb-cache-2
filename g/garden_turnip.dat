5000|$|He {{printed a}} variety of pamphlets, reiterating Brothers's views, and {{developing}} his own peculiar notions of astronomy, for which he claimed a divine origin. The heavenly bodies were created, he thinks, partly 'to amuse us in observing them.' The earth he decides to be a perfect sphere, 'not shaped like a <b>garden</b> <b>turnip,</b> as the Newtonians make it;' the sun is a created body 'very different from anything we can make here below;' the stars are 'oval-shaped immense masses of frozen water, with their largest ends foremost.' ...|$|E

50|$|Asakura {{graduated}} from the Tokyo School of Fine Arts in 1907, and he built a small studio and house at this location. He bought more land, and by 1935 had constructed the present house and attached large studio. The three-story art studio was built of ferroconcrete, with a high ceiling and skylights to let in the natural light, and the walls painted a light-brown color for a warmer effect. The studio also served as Asakura's private school, the Asakura Choso Juku ("Asakura School of Plastic Arts") from 1920 to 1944, where he trained many young sculptors. The building includes the oldest extant roof garden in Tokyo, where Asakura's students learned <b>gardening,</b> growing radishes, <b>turnips,</b> and tomatoes, {{as part of the}} teaching process intended to sharpen their senses and familiarize them with nature. The third-floor Orchid Room was originally a greenhouse for Asakura's collection of orchids, but is now used a gallery to display works depicting one of his favorite subjects, cats.|$|R
60|$|The wind roared, {{the tide}} rose, {{and the boat}} groaned and creaked. We were in the kitchen, {{trying to take the}} stove apart (the boarder was sure we could carry it up, if we could get the pipe out and the legs and doors off), when we heard a crash. We rushed on deck and found that the garden had fallen in! Making our way as well as we could toward the gaping rent in the deck, we saw that the turnip-bed had gone down bodily into the boarder's room. He did not hesitate, but {{scrambled}} down his narrow stairs. I followed him. He struck a match that he had in his pocket, and lighted a little lantern that hung under the stairs. His room was a perfect rubbish heap. The floor, bed, chairs, pitcher, basin--everything was covered or filled with <b>garden</b> mold and <b>turnips.</b> Never did I behold such a scene. He stood in the midst of it, holding his lantern high above his head. At length he spoke.|$|R
50|$|Every {{chapter of}} the manga shows this team of four {{traveling}} through the dungeon, introducing environments (such as forests and lagoons) filled with new creatures. These creatures are typical fantasy role-playing game monsters, such as walking mushrooms, screaming mandrakes, huge scorpions, mimics, golems, and slimes. Some, such as the mandrakes, mushrooms, and scorpions are not too difficult to imagine as recipe ingredients, yet others such as slimes and golems showcase Ryoko Kui’s creativity, as slimes become jerky and golems are walking <b>gardens,</b> growing lettuce, <b>turnips,</b> and other vegetables on their back. Each chapter advances the team through {{a part of the}} dungeon, and also provides a realistic-looking recipe explanation to the meals they create. The pros and cons of these meals, and the reaction of the characters, especially Marcille, provide much of the humor for the manga. Advancing through the dungeon involves tasks such as dismantling traps, and finding ways to cross the underground lagoon. The manga focuses on world-building detailed fantasy environments, and captures a daily-life snapshot of fantasy dungeon raids and those who embark on them.|$|R
6000|$|... "I visited seven farms within short {{distances}} of Victoria. The crops were oats, barley, wheat, pease, potatoes, <b>turnips,</b> <b>garden</b> herbs and vegetables, fruits, and flowers; no clover, the natural grass supplying sufficient {{food for the}} cattle and sheep. The crops were all healthy, but not heavy. The wheat was not thick on the ground, nor had it a large head. It was such a crop as would be an average only in a rich, well-cultivated district of England or Scotland; far lighter than you would see in the rich counties of England and in the Carse of Gowrie. I was informed that the ground was very badly prepared by Indian labour-- merely scratched over the surface. I believe that with efficient labour and skilful treatment, the crops could be nearly doubled. The oats and barley were very good crops, and the potatoes looked quite healthy, and I doubt not will turn out the best crop of all. The peas were decidedly an abundant crop. Vegetables thrive well, and all the ordinary fruits, apples, currants, etcetera, are excessively abundant, some of the currant-bushes breaking down {{with the weight of}} their fruit. Flowers of the ordinary sorts do well, but delicate plants don't thrive, owing to the coldness of the nights.|$|R
