It came to express a hierarchical and hierarchical value system and there is a clear increase in the number and total number of methodological and <b>scientific</b> <b>values</b> (10 %) as a default, and that the priority in methodological indicators was distributed among most indicators, indicating that the distribution of values was appropriate and well balanced.

40|$|Social {{science is}} {{sometimes}} faced with legitimizing its own <b>scientific</b> <b>value</b> to certain audiences. The Elaboration Likelihood Model offers {{a way to}} understand how audiences process information and previous studies suggest that graphical cues within science messages may help to increase its perceived <b>scientific</b> <b>value,</b> especially among individuals with lower need for cognition. This study extends these predictions into a social science context by manipulating the presence of graphical cues within a popular article using an online experiment. Results suggest that graphical cues interacted with college major where students majoring in a non-science-related field perceived messages with graphical cues to have less <b>scientific</b> <b>value,</b> which is opposite of what was predicted. Within these non-science majors, need for cognition interacted with the treatment, such that participants with higher need for cognition perceived the messages with graphical cues and having less <b>scientific</b> <b>value...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceGeomorphosites are geosites of geomorphological significance, with a {{now well}} {{admitted}} distinction between central or <b>scientific</b> <b>values</b> {{on the one}} hand, and additional values such as ecological, economical or aesthetical values on the other hand. Among the <b>scientific</b> <b>values,</b> some are directly linked to the climatic forcings through geomorphological processes {{in the case of}} active geomorphosites, for example the meaning of a waterfall in a post-glacial trough valley. In the case of passive geomorphosites, the central values rather lie in structural features, ancient landforms, inherited regoliths such as the clay-with-flints of the Chalklands of Southern England and Northern France. Sometimes, the <b>scientific</b> <b>value</b> is not fully determined by the type of geomorphosite, active or passive, but rather by the fact this geosite has a special importance concerning the history of the Earth sciences, especially in geomorphology...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Terrestrial impact {{structures}} are geological and geomorphological features with particular importance {{to understand the}} history and evolution of the planet. Impact {{structures are}} scattered around the world but in many countries these features are under threat, essentially due to anthropic factors. Impact structures with higher <b>scientific</b> <b>value</b> {{should be considered as}} geological heritage and, consequently, be subjected to geoconservation strategies. In order to select the most important impact structures to be properly conserved and managed, this paper proposes a quantitative assessment method of the <b>scientific</b> <b>value</b> of these structures. The eight Brazilian impact structures were used to test this method that {{has the potential to be}} applied to any geological context in any country. The structures known as Araguainha Dome-MT and Serra da Cangalha-TO reached a higher <b>scientific</b> <b>value,</b> which justifies the need to develop geoconservation strategies and a proper management...|$|R
