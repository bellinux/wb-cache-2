On 5 May the Yugoslav government first announced {{the results of the}} elections, which showed that 72.6 percent of the eligible electorate had cast a total of 2,778,172 ballots. The party of Bogoljub Jevtić <b>had</b> <b>received</b> 1,738,390 (62.6%) votes and 320 seats in parliament and the Opposition Bloc led by Vladko Maček <b>had</b> <b>received</b> 983,248 (35.4%) votes and 48 seats. Zbor finished last in the polls, with 23,814 (0.8%) votes, and had acquired no seats in parliament.
