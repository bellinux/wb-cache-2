In addition, such networks are often resource constrained, e. g., they should support energy management {{techniques such as}} coordinated sleep/wakeup mechanisms. Existing solutions to the real-time streaming problem are inefficient in resource consumption and have large coordination overheads (such as TDMA-based approaches), or they are unpredictable, i. e., they can only support soft real-time systems (such as contention-based approaches). This paper introduces DARTS, a protocol for <b>dynamic</b> <b>resource</b> <b>allocations</b> for real-time streams in static wireless multihop networks. With DARTS, each node dynamically negotiates (i) channel accesses for data transfers to its neighbors (for all real-time streams going through this node) and (ii) future negotiation points, thereby ensuring contention-free communication and negotiation.
