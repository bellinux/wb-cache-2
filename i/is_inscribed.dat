5|$|An epigraphic {{reference}} {{ascribed to}} Garulaka Simhaditya, {{the son of}} Varahdas, the king of Dwarka, <b>is</b> <b>inscribed</b> on a copper plate dated to 574AD, found in Palitana. The Greek writer of the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea referred to a place called Baraca, which has been interpreted as present-day Dwarka. A reference made in Ptolemy's Geography identified Barake as {{an island in the}} Gulf of Kanthils, which has also been inferred to mean Dwarka.|$|E
5|$|Following his death, Johnston was commemorated {{in several}} ways, {{including}} a memorial fund established {{in his name}} at the University of Washington to fund graduate-level research.

5|$|A {{member of}} the {{military}} elite of the First French Empire and a recipient of the Grand Aigle de la Légion d'Honneur, Comte de Nansouty was a {{member of the}} Military Household of the Emperor as First Squire of the Emperor, and also held the position of Colonel-General of Dragoons. During the Bourbon Restoration, Louis XVIII awarded him additional honours and commands, including one in the Military Household of the King of France. Nansouty died in February 1815 and is buried at the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

5|$|Altar Q is {{the most}} famous {{monument}} at Copán. It was dedicated by king Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat in AD776 and has {{each of the first}} 16 kings of the Copán dynasty carved around its side. Each figure is depicted seated on his name glyph. A hieroglyphic text <b>is</b> <b>inscribed</b> on the upper surface, relating the founding of the dynasty in AD426427. On one side, it shows the dynastic founder K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' transferring power to Yax Pasaj. Interestingly, Tatiana Proskouriakoff first discovered the inscription on the West Side of Altar Q that tells us the date of the inauguration of Yax Pasaj. This portrayal of political succession tells us much about Early Classic Maya culture.|$|E
5|$|Back in Paris, George learns from Andre {{that the}} {{manuscript}} mentions the Spanish De Vasconcellos family, who were once {{connected with the}} Templars. At the family's villa, George speaks to the family's sole surviving member, a Countess, who leads him to the De Vasconcellos mausoleum. There, George discovers the family's chalice, which the Countess entrusts to George. She asks him to find her missing ancestor, Don Carlos. In Paris, George uses the lens in the church at Montfauçon and discovers a hidden image of a burning man. In the church, George find Don Carlos' tomb, which <b>is</b> <b>inscribed</b> {{with a series of}} biblical references.|$|E
5|$|Christ Church, {{although}} a larger building than St John's, {{is the daughter}} church in Radyr. Designed by the Llandaff diocesan surveyor George Halliday, the nave was ready for use at Easter 1904 and the chancel and tower were completed in November 1910. Also in 1910 John Taylor & Co of Loughborough cast a ring of eight bells for the tower. Lieutenant Colonel Fisher paid for the bells, and each bell <b>is</b> <b>inscribed</b> {{with the names of}} members of his family.|$|E

Accordingly, passports issued to Lebanese born in Hong Kong, Macau or Taiwan now only list the place of birth, without an accompanying three-letter country code, unless upon request.|$|E
5|$|Neither the dog's grave nor mummy {{have been}} recovered. The tomb {{in which the}} tablet was {{unearthed}} is in Cemetery G 2100 in Giza West Field, close to {{the western side of}} the Great Pyramid of Giza (Pyramid of Khufu/Kheops). The white limestone tablet measures 54.2×28.2×23.2cm (21.3×11.1×9.1in) and <b>is</b> <b>inscribed</b> with ten vertical rows of hieroglyphs, separated from each other by vertical lines. Part of a leash is visible on the upper-right corner, suggesting that the tablet displayed an image of Abuwtiyuw with his owner.|$|E
5|$|On 12 September 2010 a Royal Anglian Regiment {{memorial}} {{was dedicated}} at Duxford. A fundraising campaign, which {{raised more than}} £340,000, was launched following the deaths in action of nine soldiers of 1st Battalion Royal Anglian Regiment during the unit's 2007 operational tour in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. The memorial <b>is</b> <b>inscribed</b> {{with the names of}} 78 soldiers killed since 1958 (when the first of the three East Anglian regiments was formed) in conflicts including Afghanistan, Iraq, Northern Ireland and Aden.

5|$|Stela 2 is a {{monument}} {{in the early}} Maya style that <b>is</b> <b>inscribed</b> with a damaged Long Count date. Due to its only partial preservation, this date has at least three possible readings, the latest of which would place it in the 1st century BC. Flanking the text are two standing figures facing each other, the sculpture probably represents one ruler receiving power from his predecessor. Above the figures and the text is an ornate figure depicted in profile {{looking down at the}} left-hand figure below. Stela2 is located in front of the retaining wall of Terrace5.|$|E
5|$|Stela 5 is {{reasonably}} well preserved and <b>is</b> <b>inscribed</b> with two Long Count dates flanked by representations of two standing figures portraying rulers. The latest {{of these two}} dates is AD126. The right-hand figure is holding a snake, while the left-hand figure is holding what is probably a jaguar. This monument probably represents one ruler passing power to the next. A small seated figure is carved onto each of the sides of this stela along with a badly eroded hieroglyphic inscription. The style is early Maya and has affinities with sculptures at Izapa.|$|E
5|$|The Ballcourt is {{immediately}} {{north of the}} Court of the Hieroglyphic Stairway and is {{to the south of}} the Monument Plaza. It was remodeled by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, who then demolished it and built a third version, {{which was one of the}} largest from the Classic period. It was dedicated to the great macaw deity and the buildings flanking the playing area carried 16 mosaic sculptures of the birds. The completion date of the ballcourt <b>is</b> <b>inscribed</b> with a hieroglyphic text upon the sloping playing area and is given as 6January 738.|$|E
50|$|The first Izin Fonu stamps of Northern Cyprus {{were issued}} around 1970. They <b>were</b> <b>inscribed</b> KIBRIS TURK YONETIMI. In 1972, stamps were overprinted with the {{appropriate}} inscription, and later that year another issue, <b>inscribed</b> K.T.F.D., <b>was</b> issued.

5|$|The second {{cross is}} tall and slender, a free {{standing}} monolith pillar-cross, with a slender rounded shaft (changing to square above) and a free armed head formed by notching the shaft. It is carved with figures in traditional Welsh style. One figure in particular, which looks much like {{the figure of a}} saint, <b>is</b> <b>inscribed</b> low on the north face. The Cross of St Padarn is granophyre and has Celtic interlace in panels down one face. It is uncertainly dated between the ninth and eleventh century. Though not comparable with the great Irish high crosses, it shows sophisticated carving, and willingness to bring the stone from the Mawdddach estuary, Gwynedd.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{fragmented}} votive life-size sculptures of little children lying {{on their side}} and holding a pet animal or a small object were also recovered at the temple site; among {{the best known of}} these is a sculpture of a royal child holding a dove with his right hand; the boy's head is shaved, his torso is bare and his lower body is wrapped in a large cloth. The socle of this sculpture <b>is</b> <b>inscribed</b> with a dedication from Baalshillem, the son of a Sidonian king to Eshmun, which illustrates the importance of the site to the Sidonian monarchy. These votive sculptures appear to have been purposely broken after dedication to Eshmun and then ceremoniously cast into the sacred canal, probably simulating the sacrifice of the sick child. All of these sculptures represent boys. A limestone bust of a Kouros dating from the 6thcentury BC was found at the site, but unlike the archaic Greek kouroi this figure is not bare.|$|E
5|$|Balfour {{also gave}} the island its most {{noticeable}} landmark when he recruited an Edinburgh architect, David Bryce, to transform Cliffdale House into the Scottish Baronial Balfour Castle. Other buildings he {{added to the}} island include the porter's lodge (now a public house called The Gatehouse), a water mill, a school, and a gasworks that remained operational until the 1920s. The gasworks {{is in the form}} of a round tower with a corbelled parapet of red brick and carved stones—including one possibly removed from Noltland Castle on Westray, which <b>is</b> <b>inscribed</b> with the year 1725. The structure appears to be fortified, in accordance with Balfour's intention to give the village a medieval appearance. David Balfour was also responsible for the construction of Mill Dam, a wetland which was once the water supply for the mill and is now an RSPB nature reserve.|$|E
