2500|$|Letter frequencies, like word frequencies, tend to vary, both by {{writer and}} by subject. One cannot {{write an essay}} about x-rays without using {{frequent}} Xs, and the <b>essay</b> <b>will</b> have an idiosyncratic letter frequency if the essay is about the frequent use of x-rays to treat zebras in Qatar. Different authors have habits which can be reflected {{in their use of}} letters. Hemingway's writing style, for example, is visibly different from [...] Faulkner's. Letter, bigram, trigram, word frequencies, word length, and sentence length can be calculated for specific authors, and used to prove or disprove authorship of texts, even for authors whose styles are not so divergent.|$|E

60|$|We {{have been}} occupied, perhaps, too long with De Brosses and our apology for De Brosses. Let us now examine, as shortly as possible, Mr. Max Muller's reasons for denying that fetichism is 'a {{primitive}} form of religion.' The negative {{side of his}} argument being thus disposed of, it will then be our business to consider (1) his psychological theory of the subjective element in religion, and (2) {{his account of the}} growth of Indian religion. The conclusion of the <b>essay</b> <b>will</b> be concerned with demonstrating that Mr. Max Muller's system assigns little or no place to the superstitious beliefs without which, in other countries than India, society could not have come into organised existence.|$|E
60|$|What a noble letter it is! In {{it every}} reader {{sees himself as}} in a glass. As for me, without my I's, I should be as poorly off as the great mole of Hadrian, which, being the biggest, must be also, by parity of reason, the blindest in the world. When I was in college, I confess I always liked those {{passages}} best in the choruses of the Greek drama which were well sprinkled with ai ai, they were so grandly simple. The force of great men is generally {{to be found in}} their intense individuality,--in other words, it is all in their I. The merit of this <b>essay</b> <b>will</b> be similar.|$|E

60|$|I approve greatly, my dear Sir, of your plans. Dr. Beattie's <b>essay</b> <b>will</b> {{of itself}} be a treasure. On my part, I mean {{to draw up}} an {{appendix}} to the Doctor's essay, containing my stock of anecdotes, etc., of our Scots songs. All the late Mr. Tytler's anecdotes I have by me, taken down {{in the course of}} my acquaintance with him, from his own mouth. I am such an enthusiast, that {{in the course of my}} several peregrinations through Scotland, I made a pilgrimage to the individual spot from which every song took its rise, Lochaber and the Braes of Ballendean excepted. So far as locality, either from the title of the air, or the tenor of the song, could be ascertained, I have paid my devotions at the particular shrine of every Scots Muse.|$|E
6000|$|... "The general reader," [...] says a frank critic, [...] "hates {{the very}} {{name of a}} Saga." [...] The general reader, in that case, is to be pitied, and, if possible, converted. But, just as Pascal admits that the sceptic can only become {{religious}} by living {{as if he were}} religious--by stupefying himself, as Pascal plainly puts it, with holy water--so it is to be feared that there is but a single way of winning over the general reader to the Sagas. Preaching and example, as in this brief <b>essay,</b> <b>will</b> not avail with him. He must take Pascal's advice, and live {{for an hour or two}} as if he were a lover of Sagas. He must, in brief, give that old literature a fair chance. He has now his opportunity: Mr. William Morris and Mr. Eirikr Magnusson are publishing a series of cheap translations--cheap only in coin of the realm--a Saga Library. If a general reader tries the first tale in the first volume, story of [...] "Howard the Halt,"--if he tries it honestly, and still can make no way with it, then let him take comfort in the doctrine of Invincible Ignorance. Let him go back to his favourite literature of gossiping reminiscence, or of realistic novels. We have all, probably, a drop of the Northmen's blood in us, but in that general reader the blood is dormant.|$|E
60|$|Well, {{since it}} was the printer, he was a naughty man to commit the same mistake twice in six lines: I warrant you delectus verborum, for placing of words, was his mistake too, though the author forgot to tell him of it: If it were my book, I assure you I should. For those rascals {{ought to be the}} proxies of every gentleman author, and to be chastised for him, when he is not pleased to own an error. Yet since he has given the errata, I wish he would have {{enlarged}} them only a few sheets more, and then he would have spared me the labour of an answer: For this cursed printer is so given to mistakes, that there is scarce a sentence in the preface without some false grammar, or hard sense in it; which will all be charged upon the poet, because he is so good-natured as to lay but three errors to the printer's account, and to take the rest upon himself, who is better able to support them. But he needs not apprehend that I should strictly examine those little faults, except I am called upon to do it: I shall return therefore to that quotation of Seneca, and answer, not to what he writes, but to what he means. I never intended it as an argument, but only as an illustration of what I had said before concerning the election of words; and all he can charge me with is only this, that if Seneca could make an ordinary thing sound well in Latin by the choice of words, the same, with the like care, might be performed in English: If it cannot, I have committed an error on the right hand, by commending too much the copiousness and well-sounding of our language, which I hope my countrymen will pardon me; at least the words which follow in my Dramatic <b>Essay</b> <b>will</b> plead somewhat in my behalf; for I say there, that this objection happens but seldom in a play; and then, too, either the meanness of the expression may be avoided, or shut out from the verse by breaking it in the midst.|$|E

6000|$|You have {{attacked}} me because I ventured to disapprove of Mr. Godwin's Works: I notice your attack because it affords {{me an opportunity}} of expressing more fully my sentiments respecting those principles.--I must not however wholly pass over the former part of your letter. The sentence [...] "implicating them with party and calumniating opinions," [...] is so inaccurately worded, that I must [...] "guess" [...] at your meaning. In my first essay I stated that literary works were generally reviewed by personal friends or private enemies of the Authors. This I [...] "know" [...] to be fact; and does the spirit of meekness forbid us to tell the truth? The passage in my Review of Mr. Burke's late pamphlet, you have wilfully misquoted: [...] "with respect to the work in question," [...] is an addition of your own. That work in question I myself considered as mere declamation; and [...] "therefore" [...] deemed it wofully inferior to the former production of the venerable Fanatic.--In what manner I could add to my numerous [...] "ideal" [...] trophies by quoting a beautiful passage from the pages which I was reviewing, I am ignorant. Perhaps the spirit of vanity lurked {{in the use of}} the word [...] ""I""--"ere [...] "I" [...] begin the task of blame." [...] It is pleasant to observe with what absurd anxiety this little monosyllable is avoided. Sometimes [...] "the present writer" [...] appears as its substitute: sometimes the modest author adopts the style of royalty, swelling and multiplying himself into [...] "We"; and sometimes to escape the egotistic phrases of [...] "in my opinion," [...] or, [...] "as I think," [...] he utters dogmas, and positively asserts--"exempli gratia": [...] ""It is" [...] a work, which, etc." [...] You deem me inconsistent, because, having written in praise of the metaphysician, I afterwards appear to condemn the essay on political justice. Would an eulogist of medical men be inconsistent, if he should write against vendors of (what he deemed) poisons? Without even the formality of a [...] "since" [...] or a [...] "for" [...] or a [...] "because," [...] you make an unqualified assertion, that this <b>essay</b> <b>will</b> be allowed by all, except the prejudiced, to be a deep, metaphysical work, though abstruse, etc. etc. Caius Gracchus must have been little accustomed to abstruse disquisitions, if he deem Mr. Godwin's work abstruse:--A chief (and certainly not a small) merit is its perspicuous and [...] "popular" [...] language. My chapter on modern patriotism is that which has irritated you. You condemn me as prejudiced--O this enlightened age! when it can be seriously charged against an essayist, that he is prejudiced in favour of gratitude, conjugal fidelity, filial affection, and the belief of God and a hereafter!! ...|$|E

40|$|The {{past four}} years I have devoted my studies to science and mathematics. While I have loved {{studying}} these subjects, I {{wanted to take the}} opportunity of the Senior Honors Project to explore a different field. I chose the field of writing. Being able to tell a story is one thing, but being able to tell a story well and in writing is another. The focus of my project is retrospective writing. The six written <b>essays</b> <b>will</b> be from the age of five when I entered first grade through my college years. A series of pictures will correlate with each <b>essay.</b> This <b>will</b> allow the reader of my work to compare their personal image to the real image from points in my life. The six <b>essays</b> <b>will</b> also highlight significant moments in my life as well as my most vivid memories. Essentially, “a picture is worth a thousand words. ” The progression of these <b>essays</b> <b>will</b> allow me to improve my writing through editing, tone, and style. As a student at the University of Rhode Island, I have learned the importance of being well-rounded. For the {{past four years}} as a major in Bio Science, most of my writing was in research and lab report format. For my Senior Honors Project, I chose a storytelling format to be more creative in my writing. My time spent in English 243, The Short Story, inspired me to complete this project. Dr. Barbara Conti, the professor of this course, provided me with excellent feedback on the required writing assignments from her course and I wanted to do more. Dr. Conti and I have been able to bounce ideas off one another so that the essays are both well organized and well written. My final pieces will showcase a mixture of reflection and emotion. The final product will connect both picture images and written work to tell of my journey in a series of short stories...|$|R
