"Yes, that is true," [...] said Mrs. Horn, with no {{more sense}} of wrong in the fact than the {{political}} economist has {{in the fact that}} wages are the measure of necessity and not of merit.

[...] She satisfied herself with this formula, which she did not invent, as fully {{as if it were a}} reason; but she did not dislike her niece's revolt against it. That was part of Margaret's originality, which pleased her aunt in proportion to her own conventionality; she was really a timid person, and she liked the show of courage which Margaret's magnanimity often reflected upon her. She had through her a repute, with people who did not know her well, for intellectual and moral qualities; she was supposed to be literary and charitable; she almost had opinions and ideals, but really fell short of their possession. She thought that she set bounds to the girl's originality because she recognized them. Margaret understood this better than her aunt, and knew that she had consulted her about going to see the Dryfooses out of deference, and with no expectation of luminous instruction. She was used to being a law to herself, but she knew what she might and might not do, so that she was rather a by-law. She was the kind of girl that might have fancies for artists and poets, but might end by marrying a prosperous broker, and leavening a vast lump of moneyed and fashionable life with her culture, generosity, and good-will. The intellectual interests were first with her, but she might be equal to sacrificing them; she had the best heart, but she might know how to harden it; if she was eccentric, her social orbit was defined; comets themselves traverse space on fixed lines. She was like every one else, a congeries of contradictions and inconsistencies, but obedient to the general expectation of what a girl of her position must and must not finally be. Provisionally, she was very much what she liked to be.|$|E

50|$|The rugs tend to {{be based}} on a cotton warp and have a thin, tightly knotted pile. Most Abadeh rugs are closely cut making them very flat. Although some of the older Abadehs vary in style, many of the new designs are easily recognisable. These new designs, known as Heybatlu consist of a single diamond shaped {{medallion}} in the centre with smaller medallions on each corner. The pattern is typically geometrical flowers or animals and the main colours are light reds or burnt orange on top of a dark blue background with strong green details. The corners or borders are generally ivory in colour. Although some Abadeh and Shiraz rugs appear similar Abadeh can normally be differentiated by their higher knot counts as well as the fact that the warp is invariably cotton. The rugs are almost always exclusively medium in size and the KPSI of an average Abadeh is around 90. As always in the rug-world you <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> however in general Abadeh are well made and fairly popular items, particularly in modern interiors or those with a Mediterranean or North African style.|$|E

Certainly this is not a trend but an event worth watching—and perhaps a classic benchmarking outcome. This study and paper focus on 20 large publicly traded, private, nonprofit and government organizations that replaced jobs with people’s competencies and skills as the foundation for HR practices. The paper shares what they did, why and how it worked in the words of senior leadership team members. As competencies and the people who possess them became the center of their HR programs, the study organizations reported a significant improvement in their ability to engage, communicate with, develop, provide career growth for and reward their workforce. All but one of the 20 study organizations use a scorecard to evaluate an individual’s competencies, and all but two organizations use competencies to determine pay. No study organization made the change to competencies as the centerpiece of HR programs merely to pay for competencies. Although paying for competencies was not their endgame in moving from jobs to competencies, the study organizations believe it is important as a communication message to leaders and workforce members that “you <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for.</b> ” They wanted to pay for what people know and do rather than only the jobs to which they are assigned...|$|E

40|$|No {{drainage}} {{work should be}} carried out before the drainage characteristics of the soil are established by a site and soil test pit investigation. • Two types of drainage system exist: a groundwater drainage system and a shallow drainage system. The design of the system depends entirely on the drainage characteristics of the soil. • Distinguishing between {{the two types of}} drainage systems essentially comes down to whether or not a permeable layer is present (at a workable depth) that will allow the flow of water with relative ease. If such a layer is evident, a piped drain system at that depth is likely to be effective. If no such layer is found during soil test pit investigations, {{it will be necessary to}} improve the drainage capacity of the soil. This involves a disruption technique such as moling, gravel moling or subsoiling in tandem with collector drains. • Drains are not effective unless they are placed in a free draining soil layer or complimentary measures (mole drainage, subsoiling) are used to improve soil drainage capacity. If water is not moving through the soil in one or other of these two ways, the water table will not be lowered. • Outfall level must not dictate the drainage system depth. If a free draining layer is present, it must be utilised. • Drain pipes should always be used for drains longer than 30 m. If these get blocked it is a drainage stone and not a drainage pipe issue. • Drainage stone should not be filled to the top of the field trench except for very limited conditions (the bottom of an obvious hollow). Otherwise it is an extremely expensive way of collecting little water. • Most of the stone being used for land drainage today is too big. Clean aggregate in the 10 – 40 mm (0. 4 to 1. 5 inch approx) grading band should be used. Generally you <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for.</b> • Subsoiling is not effective unless a shallow impermeable layer is being broken or field drains have been installed prior to the operation.

Open drains should be clean and as deep as possible and field drains feeding into them should be regularly rodded or jetted. Technical manua...|$|E
40|$|Two Guys from Lincoln: Cameron Shaw and Craig Roper {{offers the}} work of two {{contemporary}} artists who are inheritors of the anti-art tradition that continued {{in the wake of}} Duchamp with Warhol 2 ̆ 7 s use of popular imagery and, more recently, Koons 2 ̆ 7 controversial kitsch sculpture. Though distinct in their visions of art and the world, Shaw and Roper share more than their home town. As social and aesthetic contemporaries these two artists arrive at conclusions that suggest a generational commonality. Both artists use assemblage to address issues such as the disillusionment of youth, emblems of male dominance, the ambiguity of history, and the death of the American dream. And both artists have developed iconographies that convey multiple meanings about our collective memory. Shaw 2 ̆ 7 s highly crafted constructions and his interest in history complement Roper 2 ̆ 7 s irreverent objects and his investigations of popular culture. Together they form a compelling commentary on contemporary values. A combination of found and made elements, Craig Roper 2 ̆ 7 s objects are at once casual and confrontational. But their informal appearance belies serious content. Cheap Art, Cheap Bourbon # 2 incorporates a photographic diptych representing ajackalope labeled 2 ̆ 2 cheap art 2 ̆ 2 and the image of a framed wildlife painting of a duck inscribed as 2 ̆ 2 cheap bourbon. 2 ̆ 2 The two photos are mounted with thumb tacks onto a crude sheet of Styrofoam. Beneath this quirky union is a wooden shelf displaying two corresponding bottles of 2 ̆ 2 Bourbon de Luxe 2 ̆ 2 and a pair of shot glasses. The mixed metaphors of Cheap Art, Cheap Bourbon make explicit connections between the fantastic deception of the mythical creature, the jackal ope, and the implied manipulation of the art market and the promotion of rote representation {{in the form of the}} duck picture as 2 ̆ 2 art. 2 ̆ 2 By juxtaposing these two images with the bottles of whiskey, Roper suggests that all these things are aesthetically related, that cheap bourbon and cheap art are equally accessible at the lower echelons of consumerism. This 2 ̆ 2 you <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> 2 ̆ 2 message was delivered with a twist when Roper offered an earlier version of the piece for sale at a price of merely 100. By making the work so readily available, the artist relegated his own work to the level of the kitsch objects he parodies. Also, the raw construction of Cheap Art, Cheap Bourbon challenges the elevated standards of traditional fine art. The viewer concludes that cheap art (a. k. a. bad art) is incestuously related to inferior values, and ultimately contributes to the deterioration of our culture...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} effects of the amount of information presented, information organization, and concern about closure on selective information processing and on the degree to which consumers use price as a basis for inferring quality. Consumers are found to be less likely to neglect belief-inconsistent information and their quality inferences less influenced by price when concern about closure is low (vs. high) and information is presented randomly (vs. ordered) or a small amount of information is presented. Results provide a picture of a resource constrained consumer decision maker who processes belief-inconsistent information only when there is motivation and opportunity. 1 1 Consumers frequently assume that price and quality are highly correlated, and that as the price of a product increases, its quality increases commensurately (“you <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> for”).

40|$|Abstract. “Are <b>you</b> <b>getting</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> for? ” This Total Cost of Ownership model calculates the {{multiple}} variables that determine total cost. By using the tool when sourcing a requirement, the supply professional takes steps to mitigate risks that translate into increased cost. The tool applies weighted values to such elements as price, logistics, quality, risk, maintenance and repairs, and administrative and financing factors {{to determine a}} “total cost ” for the requirement. The tool provides a format to calculate the factors used in a Total Cost of Ownership decision. The weighted cost factors consider the importance and degree of risk involved in the purchase. Individuals should understand their own organization’s needs to define the amount of weight (risk) assigned to each variable. This model is also intended to inspire thought on how your organization can add/subtract elements to determine your own Total Cost of Ownership model. Introduction. For the Supply Chain profession, today’s roles and expectations are different when compared to past years. In the past, Purchasing personnel performed a relatively clerical role in an organization.

The following month, Incite responded in their Letters To The Editor section, spouting off in their subwords [...] "Get it, GamePROSE," [...] and many supposed fans of their magazine defending them against the spoof ad. During the remainder of the magazines 10-month lifespan, Incite ran the [...] "GamePROSE" [...] quote in every issue.|$|R
