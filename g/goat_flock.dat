Two sheep and two goat flocks were used to verify the DrenchRite['rM] larval development assay with results obtained from fecal egg reduction tests (FERT). The two flocks of each species differed in environmental exposure to gastrointestinal nematodes. The flocks were divided into three or four treatment groups: one control (not treated), a benzimidazole-treated group, a levamisole-treated group, and an ivermectin-treated group. Fecal egg reduction tests were performed with each group and correlations between the reduction percentages and the efficacy values obtained from the DrenchRite['rM] manual were used to verify the assay plate. DrenchRite[TM] indicated high resistance to the benzimidazoles {{in each of the four}} flocks. This was in agreement with the FERT data, except for Sheep Flock 2 which was moderately resistant. Data from DrenchRite[TM] pertaining to levamisole showed susceptibility for Sheep Flock 1, moderate resistance for Sheep Flock 2, susceptibility for <b>Goat</b> <b>Flock</b> 1, and moderate resistance for <b>Goat</b> <b>Flock</b> 2. The FERT data relative to levamisole showed high resistance for Sheep Flock 1, susceptibility for Sheep Flock 2, high resistance for <b>Goat</b> <b>Flock</b> l, and susceptibility for <b>Goat</b> <b>Flock</b> 2. No benzimidazole/levamisole combination was tested in the four flocks so no comparison was made to the DrenchRite[TM] data.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{estimate}} the seroprevalence of Coxiella burnetii infection in sheep and <b>goat</b> <b>flocks</b> with a history of abortion in different areas of Iran. One thousand and one hundred ovine and 180 caprine samples from 43 sheep and <b>goat</b> <b>flocks</b> in four counties located in the Northeast (Mashhad), Central (Isfahan), Western (Arak), and Southwest (Shiraz) Iran were collected randomly between March 2011 and April 2012. The CHEKIT Q fever ELISA kit was used to identify specific antibodies against C. burnetii in sheep and goats. The results showed that the overall seroprevalence of C. burnetii in sheep and goats was 19. 5 % and 27. 2 %, respectively. There was a significant difference in seropositivity between sheep and goats (P< 0. 05). Central Iran significantly had the highest prevalence among the studied areas, especially in goat coxiellosis (23. 8 % and 40. 8 % in sheep and goats, respectively). The lowest prevalence in sheep was 12. 8 % in Northeast Iran while in Western Iran C. burnetii antibodies were absent in goats. The higher prevalence of Q fever in Central Iran may be partly due to persistent favourable conditions to spread C. burnetii in this area including drought and dust storms that originated from neighbouring Iraq and Kuwait. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated the relatively high prevalence of Q fever in sheep and <b>goat</b> <b>flocks</b> with a history of abortion. Therefore, Q fever could be responsible for considerable numbers of ovine and caprine abortions in Iran...|$|R
40|$|Background Anthelmintic {{treatment}} {{is the most}} common way of controlling nematode infections in ruminants. However, several countries have reported anthelmintic resistance (AR), representing a limitation for sustainable small ruminant production. The knowledge regarding worm control management represents a baseline to develop a guideline for preventing AR. The aim {{of the present study was}} therefore to improve our knowledge about the worm control practices in small ruminant flocks in Norway. Methods A questionnaire survey regarding worm control practices was performed in small ruminant flocks in Norway. Flocks were selected from the three main areas of small ruminant farming, i. e. the coastal, inland and northern areas. A total of 825 questionnaires, comprising 587 sheep flocks (return rate of 51. 3 %) and 238 <b>goat</b> <b>flocks</b> (52. 6 %) were included. Results The results indicated that visual appraisal of individual weight was the most common means of estimating the anthelmintic dose used in sheep (78. 6 %) and goat (85. 1 %) flocks. The mean yearly drenching rate in lambs and ewes were 2. 5 ± 1. 7 and 1. 9 ± 1. 1, respectively, whereas it was 1. 0 (once a year) in goats. However, these figures were higher in sheep in the coastal area with a rate of 3. 4 and 2. 2 in lambs and ewes, respectively. Benzimidazoles were the predominant anthelmintic class used in sheep flocks (64. 9 % in 2007), whereas benzimidazoles and macrocyclic lactones were both equally used in dairy <b>goat</b> <b>flocks.</b> In the period of 2005 - 2007, 46. 3 % of the sheep flocks never changed the anthelmintic class. The dose and move strategy was practiced in 33. 2 % of the sheep flocks. Conclusions The present study showed that inaccurate weight calculation gives a risk of under-dosing in over 90 % of the sheep and <b>goat</b> <b>flocks</b> in Norway. Taken together with a high treatment frequency in lambs, a lack of anthelmintic class rotation and the common use of a dose-and-move strategy, a real danger for development of anthelmintic resistance (AR) seems to exist in Norwegian sheep and <b>goat</b> <b>flocks.</b> This risk seems particularly high in coastal areas where high treatment frequencies in lambs were recorde...|$|R

The calculated intra-herd seroprevalence (median 36 · 7 %, min-max 0 – 93 · 3 %) was smaller than in cattle or sheep flocks. Only 25 % of the farmers reported malformations in kids. Statistical analysis revealed a significantly lower risk of goats housed indoors all year-round to be infected by SBV than for goats kept outside day and night. The low intra-herd seroprevalence demonstrates that German <b>goat</b> <b>flocks</b> are still at risk of SBV infection.

40|$|Marketing of {{agricultural}} produce, including livestock {{is a major}} problem for smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe and most of Sub-Saharan Africa. This study was conducted to examine goat marketing: constraints and opportunities for enhanced cash revenue generation smallholder (communal) farmers in Zimbabwe. Quantitative data was obtained through the administration of a structured questionnaire to 317 households. Qualitative data was obtained using participatory rural appraisal (PRA) techniques. The major findings were that goats were reared for sale i. e., income generation and for household meat (protein) consumption, a major contribution to household food security. To generate immediate cash, 99 % of farmers sold goats through informal marketing. Seventy percent of the farmers sold goats any time of the year to ensure consistent cash flow for the household. However, sales were compromised by small <b>goat</b> <b>flock</b> sizes, low selling prices and lack of transport to ferry goats to lucrative urban markets. To enhance revenue generated from goat selling, a model was proposed for possible adoption by smallholder farmers.

40|$|A two-year {{epidemiology}} {{study of}} helminths of small ruminants involved {{the collection of}} viscera from 655 sheep and 632 goats from 4 abattoirs in eastern Ethiopia. A further more detailed epidemiology study of gastro-intestinal nematode infections used the Haramaya University (HU) flock of 60 Black Head Ogaden sheep. The parasitological data included numbers of nematode eggs per gram of faeces (EPG), faecal culture L 3 larvae, packed red cell volume (PCV), adult worm and early L 4 counts, and FAMACHA eye-colour score estimates, along with animal performance (body weight change). There were 13 species of nematodes and 4 species of flukes present in the sheep and goats, with Haemonchus contortus being the most prevalent (65 – 80 %), followed by Trichostrongylus spp. The nematode infection levels of both sheep and goats followed the bi-modal annual rainfall pattern, with the highest worm burdens occurring during the two rain seasons (peaks in May and September). There were significant differences in worm burdens between the 4 geographic locations for both sheep and goats. Similar seasonal but not geographical variations occurred in the prevalence of flukes. There were significant correlations between EPG and PCV, EPG and FAMACHA scores, and PCV and FAMACHA scores. Moreover, H. contortus showed an increased propensity for arrested development during the dry seasons. Faecal egg count reduction tests (FECRT) conducted on the HU flocks, and flocks in surrounding small-holder communities, evaluated the efficacy of commonly used anthelmintics, including albendazole (ABZ), tetramisole (TET), a combination (ABZ + TET) and ivermectin (IVM). Initially, high levels of resistance {{to all of the}} anthelmintics were found in the HU <b>goat</b> <b>flock</b> but not in the sheep. In an attempt to restore the anthelmintic efficacy a new management system was applied to the HU <b>goat</b> <b>flock,</b> including: eliminating the existing parasite infections in the goats, exclusion from the traditional goat pastures, and initiation of communal grazing of the goats with the HU sheep and animals of the local small-holder farmers. Subsequent FECRTs revealed high levels of efficacy of all three drugs in the goat and sheep flocks, demonstrating that anthelmintic efficacy can be restored by exploiting refugia. Individual FECRTs were also conducted on 8 sheep and goat flocks owned by neighbouring small-holder farmers, who received breeding stock from the HU. In each FECRT, 50 local breed sheep and goats, 6 – 9 months old, were divided into 5 treatment groups: ABZ, TET, ABZ + TET, IVM and untreated control. There was no evidence of anthelmintic resistance in the nematodes, indicating that dilution of resistant parasites, which are likely to be imported with introduced breeding goats, and the low selection pressure imposed by the small-holder farmers, had prevented anthelmintic resistance from emerging...|$|E

Sheep (n[*]=[*] 28) and <b>goat</b> (n[*]=[*] 28) <b>flocks</b> from three areas of Norway were randomly selected to assess the prevalence of anthelmintic resistance (AR), whereas only lambs from non-randomly selected sheep flocks (n[*]=[*] 32) with a farm management that could select for AR were investigated the second year. Only flocks with a mean excretion of nematode eggs per gram feces (EPG) ≥ 150 at time of treatment were included in the survey. In total, 48 (80 %) and 13 (46. 4 %) of the selected sheep and <b>goat</b> <b>flocks,</b> respectively, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The proportions of flocks classified as resistant (i. e., FECR < 95 % and with a lower 95 % confidence interval of < 90 %) for the BZ drug albendazole were 10. 5 % and 31. 0 % in the randomly and non-randomly selected sheep flocks, respectively.

40|$|To analyse {{the disease}} {{dynamics}} in goat herds and {{to study the}} effect of control measures, a Q fever transmission model was developed by CVI. With such a model we can study questions like ‘What strategy can lower the incidence of Q fever in goats or even lead to disease extinction?’ and ‘Is vaccination a necessary component of a control strategy?’. For that purpose we first derived a deterministic model for the spread of Coxiella burnetii within a Dutch dairy goat herd housed in a deep litter stable. This model consists {{of a system of}} Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). Parameter values were based on literature and on-going experimental work, and knowledge gaps were identified. This deterministic model was used to study the Q fever dynamics in the herd without control measures. A sensitivity analysis of the model was performed to study which parameters are most important for the model outcome. Subsequently, a stochastic version of the model was developed to study the effect of separate and combined control and management measures in detail. This was necessary because stochastic processes become important when infected animals in a herd are controlled to very low numbers. The output of that model was subsequently used by LEI to perform a cost-benefit analysis of the control and management strategies. The most important results of the Q fever modelling study are as follows: • Due to the synchronised lambing season in combination with most C. burnetii excretion at partus and abortion, Q fever prevalence shows a saw-tooth pattern within a year. From year to year, a peak is observed in number of infected animals, abortions and infection pressure in year 1 - 2 after introduction of C. burnetii in the herd. • The epidemiological analyses show that vaccination is effective in quickly reducing the prevalence in a dairy <b>goat</b> <b>flock.</b> Other control strategies have more impact on flock management (more replacement of animals); (re-) infections can than lead to greater outbreaks due to the higher number of susceptible animals in the flock. • When looking at the average time to extinction of the infection and at the infection pressure in a <b>goat</b> <b>flock,</b> the best control strategy is “Preventive vaccination” (i. e. yearly), followed by the reactive vaccination strategies “Vaccination after abortion storm” and “Vaccination after BTM (bulk tank milk) positive”. • When aiming at a fast reduction of the Q fever infection pressure to the environment (like bacterial spores in dust), the strategy “Culling of pregnant animals after abortion storm” is effective. Then, no peak is observed anymore in number of infected animals, abortions and infection pressure in the goat herd. However, Q fever will not go extinct by this measure. • Infected lactating goats excrete C. burnetii bacteria intermittently, and in different amounts. A Search&Destroy method by PCR of milk with a sensitivity of 50 % of detecting and culling infected goats, will not result in extinction of Q fever in the flock. This control measure was the worst of the six evaluated strategies. • Next to the reactive strategies, Q fever can be controlled by manipulating the frequency of pregnancy (and thus lambing) of goats. The herd management style “Every year pregnant” is always worse than the other two herd management styles “Every two year pregnant” and “First two years pregnant”. • C. burnetii can survive from breeding season to breeding season as intracellular bacterium in the goat (persistent infection). According to the model, these persistently infected goats are sufficient for the bacterium to survive from year to year in the flock. • The average lifetime of a goat in a Dutch dairy <b>goat</b> <b>flock</b> is 2. 7 year. If vaccination will be stopped, within a few years most of the animals in the flock are without immunity against C. burnetii. This susceptible population is very vulnerable for (re-) introductions of Q fever. • During the modelling study, gaps in knowledge were identified, and assumptions had to be made. ¿ The transmission rate, the fraction of infected pregnant animals to become persistently infected and the fraction of C. burnetii excretion targeted to dust could not be estimated with certainty from literature data. Therefore, the infection dynamics in the model was studied for a range of values for these parameters. The parameter values which achieved a high abortion peak in the second season and a lower disease incidence in later seasons were used in the default model. ¿ Infection pressure caused by non-pregnant goats. It is unknown what the effect is of an infection in non-pregnant goats and how many and how long C. burnetii bacteria will be excreted to the environment. Also unknown is the fraction of these goats which becomes immune after acute infection. ¿ Infection pressure caused by spores of bacteria. C. burnetii can survive from breeding season to breeding season as bacterial spore. However, the fraction of surviving spores after one year is unknown, and so is their contribution to the infection pressure from stable environment to the <b>goat</b> <b>flock.</b> De conclusions of the economic analysis are: • As the dairy goat vaccination programme continues, future expenses in maintaining the current protected status are relatively low. • For Q-fever infected goat farms in the Netherlands preventive vaccination is always the preferred control strategy compared to other analysed control strategies. This also holds for a partial analysis if only on-farm costs and benefits are accounted for. • Averted human health costs depend to a large extend on the number of infected human cases per infected farm or animal.

40|$|Nearly 90 % of the {{national}} <b>goat</b> <b>flock</b> in Zimbabwe is kept in the smallholder sector. Goat production in the smallholder farming systems fulfils multiple roles that include; the provision of meat, milk, manures, skins, and barter trade. The farmers here keep the indigenous breeds which are hardy and also have a high prolificacy rate. However, despite their prolificacy, productivity remains low in this sector. The main constraints are high prevalence of diseases and parasites, high mortality rates, inappropriate housing, lack of records, inbreeding, and limited forage availability. However, this study was baseline survey and it sought to identify housing systems used in the small holder farms and to evaluate the effect those housing systems on productivity. The study {{was carried out in}} Mbizingwe village. The area is in a semi-arid region of Zimbabwe where there is low rainfall and high abundance of browsable tree species. A structured questionnaire was administered to collect the data for the study and 28 farmers partook in this survey. Data was analysed using SPSS and a chi square test was used to analyse the effect of different housing systems on flock sizes. The results showed that farmers in Mbizingwe were using roofed, unroofed over ground and concrete floor housing kraal. This research also revealed that housing had an effect on goat productivity. The majority of farmers were using unroofed kraals and their flock performance was low compared to the other housing systems...|$|E
40|$|Major part of {{the area}} of the Czech Republic proves to be iodine deficient. This fact results in endemic inci-dence of animals ’ iodine deficiency. Iodine {{deficiencies}} were described recently in cattle (Kursa et al., 1997) in the Czech Republic. Clinically manifested toxoplasmo-sis of goats was documented in the Czech Republic and was confirmed by the findings of aborted foetuses, rapid seroconversion of antibodies to Toxoplasma gon-dii within the flock and, typically, pathological and ana-tomical findings in aborted foetuses (Šlosárková et al., 1999). The pathogenic effect of T. gondii has been proved and the animals coming from the flock were identified as hypoiodemic. Since other goat flocks in the Czech Republic showed 20 % antibody prevalence to T. gondii without any clinical manifestations (Literák et al., 1995), we assumed that in case of <b>goat</b> <b>flock</b> suffering from clinical toxoplasmosis the development of clinical toxoplasmosis was influenced by the iodine deficiency in pregnant goats (Šlosárková et al., 1999). This assumption is supported also by the results of a previous study according to which iodine deficiency in people leads to the increase of antibody prevalence to T. gondii within particular population (Singh et al., 1994). Except these two studies (Singh et al., 1994; Šlosárková et al., 1999), no other literature about the relation between iodine supplementation and clinical signs of toxoplasmosis was available. We know, that iodine deficiency influences immune system negatively (Jones et al., 1986; Aumont et al., 1989) and that host’s immune response has crucial impact on progress o...|$|E

40|$|Giardia duodenalis and Cryptosporidium spp. are {{gastro-intestinal}} protozoa {{known to}} infect small ruminants. Both protozoa are also {{considered as a}} potential public health concern. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine their prevalence in lambs and goat kids kept under common Mediterranean dairy husbandry systems and to identify the species and genotypes infecting these small ruminants. In total, 684 faecal samples (429 from lambs and 255 from goat kids) were collected on 21 farms in Greece and examined using a quantitative immunofluorescence assay. G. duodenalis was detected in 37. 3 % of the lambs and 40. 4 % of the goat kids. On all but one of the farms G. duodenalis was detected. Most samples were typed as a mono-infection with G. duodenalis assemblage E, both on the beta-giardin gene and the triose phosphate isomerase gene. Only 10 % of samples were typed as mixed assemblage A and E infections. The prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. was 5. 1 % in lambs and 7. 1 % in goat kids. In total, 8 out of the 14 farms with a sheep flock and 7 out of the 14 farms with a <b>goat</b> <b>flock</b> were positive. Cryptosporidium parvum (subtype IId), C. ubiquitum and C. xiaoi were identified, the latter especially in goat kids. In conclusion, the results of the present study illustrate that G. duodenalis and Cryptosporidium spp. occur frequently on both sheep and goats farms. The prevalence of zoonotic genotypes or species was low, indicating a limited but existing risk for zoonotic infections...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} farmers’ preferences for goat breeds, desired traits, management and breeding practices in agro-pastoral communities {{of central and eastern}} Tanzania. A total of 552 goat keepers from semi-arid and sub-humid areas were involved. Information on <b>goat</b> <b>flock</b> size, breed preferences, breeding practices, traits preferred and husbandry practices was collected using a well structured questionnaire. Out of the 552 household heads, only 21. 3 % were women. Most of the farmers kept indigenous goats belonging to the Small East African breed and the mean number of goats per household was 8. 9 ± 1. 0. The majority of the farmers (53. 4 %) preferred to keep the Small East African goat breed rather than the exotic breeds. The Small East African breed was preferred to exotic breeds because the animals are easier to feed, prolific, tolerant to drought and endemic diseases. Most farmers (70. 8 %) practiced uncontrolled mating using bucks from either their own flock (66. 7 %) or neighbours’ flocks (33. 3 %). Uncontrolled mating was preferred because it is easier to practice (41. 2 %) and cheaper (41. 2 %). The buck to doe ratio was 1 : 3 in semi-arid and 1 : 2 in sub-humid areas. Breeding males were selected based on body size by the majority (85 %) of the goat farmers. It is concluded that livestock keepers in semi-arid and sub-humid areas in Tanzania prefer the Small East Africa goats because the animals are abundantly available and well adapted to the local environmental conditions.

40|$|This study {{utilised}} epidemiological, haematological, pathological {{findings and}} serological detection of specific antibodies {{to evaluate and}} confirm a peste des petit ruminants (PPR) outbreak in a herd of west African dwarf (WAD) goats in Ibadan, Nigeria. The morbidity and mortality rates post exposure (PE) were 96 % and 60 % respectively. Laboratory analyses revealed significant differences (PÂ <Â  0. 05) in mean values of the haematological and serum biochemical indices between the PE and control groups. The PE group experienced a significant (PÂ <Â  0. 05) increase in white blood cell (WBC), lymphocyte and monocytes after 10 Â days PE; the drop in glucose {{and high levels of}} alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and aspartate amino transferase (AST) indicated liver damage, while increased serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and uric acid arose from kidney impairment. The electrolyte imbalance (potassium, sodium and chloride ions) resulting from the symptomatic diarrhea affected the functionality of the Na+âK+ pump mechanisms, hence pathologic damage to the liver, kidneys, skin, gastrointestinal, respiratory and cardiovascular systems. The competitive enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assay (c-ELISA) detected varying antibody levels in the PPR infected WAD goats; the percent inhibition was highest (PÂ <Â  0. 001) in survivors (70. 00 Â Â±Â  1. 73), then in contact group (60. 00 Â Â±Â  2. 00), and least in infected (23. 33 Â Â±Â  1. 53), which were sero-negative.
