5|$|The {{back wall}} of the room, which is in shadow, is <b>hung</b> <b>with</b> rows of paintings, {{including}} {{one of a series of}} scenes from Ovid's Metamorphoses by Peter Paul Rubens, and copies, by Velázquez's son-in-law and principal assistant Juan del Mazo, of works by Jacob Jordaens. The paintings are shown in the exact positions recorded in an inventory taken around this time. The wall to the right is <b>hung</b> <b>with</b> a grid of eight smaller paintings, visible mainly as frames owing to their angle from the viewer. They can be identified from the inventory as more Mazo copies of paintings from the Rubens Ovid series, though only two of the subjects can be seen.|$|E

5|$|In 1975 London's National Portrait Gallery {{formed the}} first of its {{regional}} partnerships, a partnership that marries empty large antique spaces with the many paintings the gallery has insufficient space to display. This has seen Montacute's Long Gallery redecorated and restored and <b>hung</b> <b>with</b> an important collection of 16th- and 17th-century old master portraits.|$|E

5|$|Over the years, Hydro-Québec {{researchers}} engineered a {{new type}} of pylon, the V-guyed tower, which reduced materials consumption to 11.8 tonnes of steel per kilometre of power line. This type of tower also includes a variation with longer side crossbars, where all conductors are <b>hung</b> <b>with</b> a V-shaped insulator and one with shorter side crossbar, where only the middle bundle hangs from the insulator and the side bundles are strung on vertical insulator strings.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} type of tower {{used was}} a massive self-supporting delta pylon, or waist pylon, which consumed 21 tonnes of steel per kilometre of line. This type of pylon {{was used for the}} first 735kV power line from the Manic-Outardes power stations to the load centre of Montreal. There are two significant variations of the delta pylon; one has longer side crossbars such that all three bundles of conductors are suspended on V-shaped insulators. The other has shorter side crossbars, such that the two outside bundles are hung on a vertical insulator string and only the middle bundle is <b>hung</b> <b>with</b> a V-shaped insulator.|$|E

I thought that was a beautiful line. 'I was <b>hung</b> up <b>with</b> God - I was trying to find God' is what he's saying. I guess you guys figured that out, right?" ...|$|R

5|$|The {{relatively}} small study contains {{plans for the}} house and potential impressions for various elevations. One is reputed to have been drawn by Sir Francis Dashwood himself, while the Tapestry Room, once ante-room to the adjoining former principal bedroom, is <b>hung</b> <b>with</b> Brussels tapestries depicting peasant scenes by Teniers. Dashwood inherited them in 1763 from his uncle Lord Westmorland, {{who is said to}} have been given them by the 1st Duke of Marlborough to celebrate their victories in the Low Countries.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} Williams singing the opening verses and dancing on a street. Beyoncé, wearing an apostolic-like gown {{to fit the}} theme of the track, appears at 90 seconds into the song to deliver her verse in a forest in front of a tree <b>hung</b> <b>with</b> paper lanterns. Rowland appears soon after in the same forest wearing a white crop top, smiling. The singers appear {{together}} in the video's last section when Williams, Beyoncé and Rowland sing and dance together at a street-party scene along with dancers who are shown waving their flags and playing drums. The choreography present in the video was noted to be traditional African.|$|E
5|$|When the Sultan {{appeared}} before the Fortress he saw the walls <b>hung</b> <b>with</b> red cloth, as though for a festive reception, and a single great cannon thundered once to greet the mighty warrior monarch. The siege began on 6 August when Suleiman ordered a general assault on the ramparts, although the attack was successfully repulsed. Despite being undermanned, and greatly outnumbered, the defenders were sent no reinforcements from Vienna by the imperial army.|$|E

5|$|Working for Clair Brothers, Jackson toured with Elvis Presley, mixing {{monitors}} while independent engineer Bill Porter mixed {{front of}} house (FOH) for the audience. Clair Brothers supplied all the audio gear; Jackson designed a powerful stage monitor system for Presley's show. To make {{more room for}} audience seating, he also used a sound reinforcement system that was not mounted on scaffolding but <b>hung</b> <b>with</b> steel chain above the audience from overhead beams, using chain hoists rigged upside down to raise the loudspeakers from the floor—a now-common method used by licensed riggers. Jackson {{has said that he}} made a number of concert recordings during this period, all unreleased.|$|E
5|$|On {{display in}} the house is an {{important}} collection of fine art and antiquities built up by many generations of the Bankes family, the core having been assembled by Sir Ralph Bankes in Gray's Inn before the house was built. One of the rooms, the Spanish room (named by reason of the paintings of Bartolomé Esteban Murillo which hang there), has walls <b>hung</b> <b>with</b> gilded leather. It was recently restored at a cost of several hundred thousand pounds over a five-year period. Other important collections include paintings of the Bankes family stretching back over 400 years. Other artworks include works by Diego Velázquez, Anthony van Dyck, Titian and Jan Brueghel the Younger. A portrait of Nicolò Zen the younger by Titian was discovered in the collection in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The Nightmare {{simultaneously}} offers {{both the}} image of a dream—by indicating the effect of the nightmare on the woman—and a dream image—in symbolically portraying the sleeping vision. It depicts a sleeping woman draped over the end of a bed with her head hanging down, exposing her long neck. She is surmounted by an incubus that peers out at the viewer. The sleeper seems lifeless and, lying on her back, takes a position then believed to encourage nightmares. Her brilliant coloration is set against the darker reds, yellows, and ochres of the background; Fuseli used a chiaroscuro effect to create strong contrasts between light and shade. The interior is contemporary and fashionable and contains a small table on which rests a mirror, phial, and book. The room is <b>hung</b> <b>with</b> red velvet curtains which drape behind the bed. Emerging from a parting in the curtain is the head of a horse with bold, featureless eyes.|$|E

5|$|In 1552 Dudley {{was made}} a Knight of the Garter; {{at the end of}} the year he was sent on a {{diplomatic}} mission to discuss Edward VI's hopes to mediate for peace between the Empire and France. He first travelled to Brussels, where he was received by Mary of Hungary on 8 January 1553. Impatient to see the Emperor himself, he tried to intercept him on his way to Flanders. Sir Richard Morrison, the English resident ambassador with Charles V, knew nothing of this until he met Dudley at Treves. The ailing ruler was averse to be molested by diplomats while journeying, nevertheless Morrison arranged an interview at Luxembourg in which Charles referred them to a later occasion. On 11 February 1553 the Emperor gave the Englishmen an audience at Brussels. When Dudley offered to kiss his hand, he embraced him. The visitors noted that the chamber was <b>hung</b> <b>with</b> tapestries depicting the Emperor's victories at Tunis. Charles V was non-committal, declaring that he was well-disposed to peace if he only could trust the French king. On returning to England Dudley had an audience with Edward on 19 February. Jehan Scheyfve, the Emperor's agent, reported that Dudley was discreet, and only mentioned that Charles had given him a present. The French ambassador in London was not pleased. Dudley was elected MP for Oxfordshire in the March parliament of 1553, carrying Edward's train at the proceedings.|$|E
5|$|Some of Belton's many {{rooms have}} been altered {{over the last}} 300 years both in use and design. One of the {{principal}} rooms, the Marble Hall (1), {{the first of the}} large reception rooms, serves as an entrance hall from the south entrance, and takes its name from a chequer board patterned floor of black and white marble tiles. By the time of Belton's conception, the great hall was no longer a place for the household to eat, but intended as a grand entrance to the house. The hall was originally <b>hung</b> <b>with</b> 28 portraits of Kings, Queens, and Emperors, from William the Conqueror to William III, intended to give the house an air of dynastic importance. The less numerous and far newer Brownlow family portraits were originally hung in the Great Dining Room immediately above. The room is fully panelled, and parts of the panelling contain lime wood embellishments attributed to Grinling Gibbons. In the early 19th century, this room, and some others, were re-modelled by Jeffry Wyatville, who in addition to graining and painting the panelling to imitate oak installed new doors.|$|E
5|$|The Order {{was without}} a {{ceremonial}} home until 1881 when arrangements {{were made to}} display banners, helms and hatchment plates (the equivalent of stall plates, {{in the absence of}} stalls) in the Great Hall, officially called St. Patrick's Hall, in Dublin Castle. On the establishment of the Irish Free State the banners of the living knights were removed. When the Hall was redecorated in 1962 it was decided that it should be <b>hung</b> <b>with</b> the banners {{of the members of the}} Order in 1922. The existing banners were repaired or new ones made; it is these banners which can be seen today. The Hall, which was renamed St Patrick's Hall from its association with the Order, also served as the Chancery of the Order. Installation ceremonies, and later investitures, were held here, often on St Patrick's Day, until they were discontinued. A banquet for the Knights was often held in the Hall on the occasion of an installation. St Patrick's Hall now serves as the location for the inauguration of the President of Ireland. If an incumbent Irish president dies in office (such as Erskine Hamilton Childers in 1974), he lies in state in the hall.|$|E

50|$|In the United Kingdom, most polls {{failed to}} predict the Conservative {{election}} victories of 1970 and 1992, and Labour's victory in 1974. However, their figures at other elections have been generally accurate. In the 2015 election virtually every poll predicted a <b>hung</b> parliament <b>with</b> Labour and the Conservatives neck and neck when the actual result was a clear Conservative majority. On the other hand, in 2017, the opposite appears to have occurred. Most polls predicted a Conservative landslide, even though in reality the election resulted in a <b>hung</b> parliament <b>with</b> the Conservatives losing their majority.|$|R
