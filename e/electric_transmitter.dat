The resolution of the target can be improved using electrical downhole transmitters. So far there have been no reports of the detection of permafrost gas hydrate deposits with surface electromagnetic methods.

40|$|EGU 2010 - 9841 Active mud volcanoes, where {{changing}} salinities of pore fluids, large {{temperature gradients}} and occurrences of free gas are frequently observed, should potentially exhibit significant variability in their internal resistivity structure. This {{is due to}} the fact that the bulk resistivity is mainly determined by the porosity of sediments and the electrical resistivity of the pore filling contained therein. The resistivity variations may be derived from controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM) measurements. CSEM systems consist of an <b>electric</b> dipole <b>transmitter</b> producing a time varying source field and electric dipole receivers, which measure the earth´s response to this signal. For a RWE Dea funded investigation of fluid and gas leakages at the North Alex Mud Volcano (NAMV) - a comparatively small target with an area of about 1 km 2 - we have developed a new high resolution CSEM system. The system consists of several autonomous electric dipole receivers and a lightweight <b>electric</b> dipole <b>transmitter,</b> which can be mounted on a small remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV). The use of a ROV allows for a precise placement of the transmitter, which is a necessary prerequisite for the investigation of such a small target. Furthermore, electromagnetic signals may be transmitted from different directions with respect to the stationary receivers, allowing for a 3 D-style tomographic experiment. In this experiment, ten receivers were deployed over the surface of NAMV at a total of 16 receiver locations. During three successful dives with a Cherokee ROV (Ghent University, Belgium), the transmitter was deployed at a total of 80 locations. Here we present first quantitative results consisting of apparent resistivity estimations from the CSEM time domain data for each transmitter-receiver pair. The apparent resistivity map shows that the NAMV indeed has a heterogeneous resistivity structure with apparent resistivities varying by at least a factor of two: low apparent resistivities (0. 8 Ωm) are found towards the center of the MV, whereas higher apparent resistivities (1. 6 Ωm) prevail away from the center. In a second step, we interpret the time-domain data based on 1 D inversions. Good data fits can be achieved by models containing 2 - 3 layers. Generally, the models indicate low resistivities at the surface, which can be associated with penetrating salt water and/or high temperatures. Toward greater depths, increasing resistivities presumably are due to a combination of compaction of sediments (i. e. reduced pore space), an increased presence of fresh water and possible occurrences of free gas. For some 1 D models, the increase in resistivity exceeds a factor of 10 or more and layer interfaces are indicated down to depths of up to 70 m. The derived resistivity variations observed at the NAMV will be interpreted in conjunction with temperature (Feseker, this session), fluid flow (Brückmann et al., this session) and seismic data (Bialas et al., this session) acquired. Temperature variations measured in the upper few meters are related to fluid flow, where high temperatures are indicative of upwelling fluids of low salinity and low temperature of either a downward flow of saline fluids or no flow activity. This type of surface measurement constitutes an integrative fluid flow gauge, which we can resolve vertically with our resistivity models. Seismic data yield a background structure to our resistivity model. New analysis of seismic data shows that seismic activity may also be linked to fluid flow activity, which we aim to match with resistivity variations and oscillations, which were observed in the electric and magnetic fields (Lefeldt et al., this session) ...|$|R

5000|$|In its {{application}} to the Federal Communications Commission, The Gazette sought authority to construct a 300 ft tower on Ayer's Hill, the highest point of land in Haverhill. The station would transmit at a frequency of 46.5 MHz (a frequency then assigned to FM) and use a 1,000 watt Western <b>Electric</b> (AT&T) <b>transmitter.</b> At that time, Western Electric operated a manufacturing facility in the city. Russ predicted the station would cost $30,000 to $50,000, operate eight hours-a-day at the start and employ 11 people. One of the first delays in moving the station forward was a debate over {{the location of the}} tower. The Gazette indicated its selection of Ayer’s Hill was second to Silver Hill, a more centrally located city-owned parcel. Mayor Glynn and some alderman were willing to sell or lease the Silver Hill site, but others held out for using the site as a war memorial. J.R. Poppele, chief engineer of WOR, New York, conducted the original survey of sites. The Gazette ultimately bought the Silver Hill site at auction and the FCC conditionally granted the license December 10, 1945. The war memorial, incidentally, was not constructed for another 40 years and was placed at another location. A major blow to the FM project came, however, when the FCC moved FM’s spectrum assignment from the 42 - 50 MHz band, allocated just before the war, to the 88 - 106 (later expanded to 108) MHz band. This had the effect of rendering 500,000 receivers obsolete.

40|$|In {{many cases}} of {{exploration}} geophysics, isotropic Earth forward models have been developed and measured data can be interpreted by inversion using this class of model. An isotropic model treats the Earth as a simple structure, in which the relevant physical properties do not vary with direction, and {{the interpretation of the}} measured responses requires relatively less effort compared to interpretations based on anisotropic models. However, the actual Earth has anisotropic physical properties. Thus, a better understanding of anisotropic Earth responses using the MCSEM method is the main objective of this thesis. The controlled-source electromagnetic response in the frequency domain due to excitation by a horizontal <b>electric</b> dipole (HED) <b>transmitter</b> is herein evaluated over a layered seafloor consisting of a uniaxial anisotropic layer and an isotropic basement. Nominally, the upper uniaxial layer represents a thin-layered or interbedded earth formation caused by sedimentation over geologic time. Unlike an isotropic layer, a uniaxial layer is characterized by different values of electrical conductivity along two different directions. To solve the MCSEM forward problem for a uniaxial model with vertical anisotropy, it is required to combine Faraday?s law and Ampere?s law without displacement current, thereby forming the governing pre-Maxwell?s equations. The resulting diffusion equation in the spatial (x, y) domain is converted to horizontal wavenumber (p, q) domain using a 2 -D Fourier transform. The solution is analytic {{in the case of a}} uniaxial halfspace. The required source terms from an HED deployed in a conducting isotropic wholespace are derived from the Hertz vector potential and expressed, as usual in this type of problem, by Hankel transforms. Numerical modeling is required to evaluate MCSEM responses of more complicated Earth models, whether isotropic or anisotropic. Herein, the response of a resistive disk located below a vertical anisotropic layer is considered. This serves to investigate the effect of the anisotropic overburden on resolving the underlying disk. The response of the resistive disk placed beneath the anisotropic layer is finally evaluated using a finite element method implemented in the code SEATEM, which was previously developed by Badea et al. (2001) ...|$|R
40|$|Even though first {{experiments}} for {{the characterization}} of the seafloor using marine electromagnetic (EM) methods were already {{carried out in the}} mid 1960 ’s, they have only played a minute role in marine academic investigation for several decades. Only in the past decade, the strongly increasing interest of oil companies for alternative investigation methods for marine oil and gas exploration brought the use of EM methods into the focus of attention. Traditional founders of marine EM methods (Scripps, U of Toronto, U of Southampton) are now accompanied by newly established commercial (e. g. Exxon, AOA Geophysics, OHM surveys, EMGS, Statoil) as well as academic groups. The marine EM group at the IFM GEOMAR, which was established in 2006, initially focused on the development and testing of EM receivers (RX) for magnetotelluric (MT) measurements. Successful measurements were taken during a cruise to the Costa Rican trench (2007 / 08, see Worzewski, this session). However, these measurements revealed some problems with this first generation of instruments (e. g. stability of stations on the ocean-floor). A subsequent, much improved generation of MT receivers developed in 2008 was successfully deployed during cruises to the Alboran Sea (2009) and the Cyprus Arc (2010) and is currently used in investigations of the Walvis Ridge (Namibia, 2011) and the New Zealand Subduction Zone (2011). For a RWE Dea funded project at the North Alex Mud Volcano (NAMV), a second line of development at the IFM-GEOMAR focused on development of controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM) equipment. For this first project, safety concerns (slop stability) as well as the comparatively small size of the investigated target ([ca. ] 1 km 2) required a new approach to allow for a secure, high resolution CSEM experiment. For this type of experiment, the existing MT receivers were extended to include a high frequency CSEM mode (10 kHz) for the electric fields. Additionally, a lightweight <b>electric</b> dipole <b>transmitter</b> (TX), which can be mounted on a small remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) was developed. In a 3 D-style tomographic experiment (Nov. 2008), ten receivers were deployed over the surface of NAMV at a total of 16 receiver locations and in three successful dives with a Cherokee ROV (Ghent University, Belgium), the transmitter was deployed at a total of 80 locations. Since both RXs and TX were stationary during measurements, a small dipole moment of 200 Am (20 A current, 10 m dipole length) was sufficient to collect transient data up to RX-TX distances of more than 1 km. Generally, navigational inaccuracy limits the accuracy and thus also the resolution of CSEM measurements, which is mainly due to the constantly moving sources used in most commercial systems. The good quality of data recorded during the initial experiment at the NAMV raises the question, if this issue may for some types of CSEM experiments may be remedied by using stationary transmitters instead of flying sources. During the upcoming experiment in New Zealand (April 2011), we will find some answers to this question with our new CSEM transmitter system, which has a higher dipole moment ([ca. ] 1 kAm) and the capability to perform the navigation between TX and the RXs directly on the ocean floor...|$|R
40|$|Recent marine long-offset {{transient}} electromagnetic (LOTEM) measurements {{yielded the}} offshore delineation of a fresh groundwater body beneath the seafloor {{in the region}} of Bat Yam, Israel. The LOTEM application was effective in detecting this freshwater body underneath the Mediterranean Sea and allowed an estimation of its seaward extent. However, the measured data set was insufficient to understand the hydrogeological configuration and mechanism controlling the occurrence of this fresh groundwater discovery. Especially the lateral geometry of the freshwater boundary, important for the hydrogeological modelling, could not be resolved. Without such an understanding, a rational management of this unexploited groundwater reservoir is not possible. Two new high-resolution marine time-domain electromagnetic methods are theoretically developed to derive the hydrogeological structure of the western aquifer boundary. The first is called Circular Electric Dipole (CED). It is the land-based analogous of the Vertical Electric Dipole (VED), which is commonly applied to detect resistive structures in the subsurface. Although the CED shows exceptional detectability characteristics in the step-off signal towards the sub-seafloor freshwater body, an actual application was not carried out in the extent of this study. It was found that the method suffers from an insufficient signal strength to adequately delineate the resistive aquifer under realistic noise conditions. Moreover, modelling studies demonstrated that severe signal distortions are caused by the slightest geometrical inaccuracies. As a result, a successful application of CED in Israel proved to be rather doubtful. A second method called Differential Electric Dipole (DED) is developed {{as an alternative to the}} intended CED method. Compared to the conventional marine time-domain electromagnetic system that commonly applies a horizontal <b>electric</b> dipole <b>transmitter,</b> the DED is composed of two horizontal electric dipoles in an in-line configuration that share a common central electrode. Theoretically, DED has similar detectability/resolution characteristics compared to the conventional LOTEM system. However, the superior lateral resolution towards multi-dimensional resistivity structures make an application desirable. Furthermore, the method is less susceptible towards geometrical errors making an application in Israel feasible. In the extent of this thesis, the novel marine DED method is substantiated using several one-dimensional (1 D) and multi-dimensional (2 D/ 3 D) modelling studies. The main emphasis lies on the application in Israel. Preliminary resistivity models are derived from the previous marine LOTEM measurement and tested for a DED application. The DED method is effective in locating the two-dimensional resistivity structure at the western aquifer boundary. Moreover, a prediction regarding the hydrogeological boundary conditions are feasible, provided a brackish water zone exists at the head of the interface. A seafloor-based DED transmitter/receiver system is designed and built at the Institute of Geophysics and Meteorology at the University of Cologne. The first DED measurements were carried out in Israel in April 2016. The acquired data set is the first of its kind. The measured data is processed and subsequently interpreted using 1 D inversion. The intended aim of interpreting both step-on and step-off signals failed, due to the insufficient data quality of the latter. Yet, the 1 D inversion models of the DED step-on signals clearly detect the freshwater body for receivers located close to the Israeli coast. Additionally, a lateral resistivity contrast is observable in the 1 D inversion models that allow to constrain the seaward extent of this freshwater body. A large-scale 2 D modelling study followed the 1 D interpretation. In total, 425 600 forward calculations are conducted to find a sub-seafloor resistivity distribution that adequately explains the measured data. The results indicate that the western aquifer boundary is located at 3600 m - 3700 m before the coast. Moreover, a brackish water zone of 3 Omega*m to 5 Omega*m with a lateral extent of less than 300 m is likely located at the head of the freshwater aquifer. Based on these results, it is predicted that the sub-seafloor freshwater body is indeed open to the sea and may be vulnerable to seawater intrusion. ...|$|R
