Both men gave their support to the Rampart Dam project, with Kennedy saying, [...] "I see the greatest dam <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>world</b> at Rampart Canyon, producing twice {{the power of the}} Tennessee Valley Authority to light homes and mills and cities and farms all over Alaska."

[...] As military operations increased in Vietnam in mid-February, Nixon's standing against President Johnson improved. A Harris poll showed that he trailed the president 43% to 48%. Near {{the end of the}} month, Nixon's opponent George Romney exited the race, mostly due to comments he made about being [...] "brainwashed" [...] during a visit to Vietnam. This left Nixon nearly unopposed for the upcoming primaries, narrowing his opponents to Nelson Rockefeller and Ronald Reagan, neither of whom had announced their candidacies.|$|E

2500|$|I have {{discovered}} that {{the public in the}} Holy Land does not fully believe the terrible horror that has befallen our nation in exile. Sadly, the bitter truth is many, many times worse than anything you have heard. All that is known <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>world</b> is but a drop in the ocean of massacres battering European Jewry. To all those doubters, I can bear witness from my own personal experience that all current descriptions are as nothing compared with the awful truth. On leaving Hungary, I saw with my own eyes wagonloads of Italian Jews being transported to their death in Poland. Elderly, women, young children, pushing their shrunken hands through the bars, begging for [...] "Water! Water!" [...] But the Gestapo troops did not allow anyone to approach the death train and assist the captives. I saw prisoners crazed from thirst attacking each other and biting their flesh.|$|E

After the 1954 Geneva Conference, an appearance of neutrality was preserved by posting [...] "civilians" [...] to military aid positions. When President John F.

No; I did not hate him. The word is too weak. There is no word in the {{language}} strong enough to describe my feelings. I can say only that I knew the gnawing of a desire for vengeance on him that was a pain in itself and that exceeded all the bounds of language. I shall not tell you of the hours I devoted to plans of torture on him, nor of the diabolical means and devices of torture that I invented for him. Just one example. I was enamoured of the ancient trick whereby an iron basin, containing a rat, is fastened to a man's body. The only way out for the rat is through the man himself. As I say, I was enamoured of this until I realized that such a death was too quick, whereupon I dwelt long and favourably on the Moorish trick of--but no, I promised to relate no further of this matter.

In particular, after trade liberalization, the poor countries of the world are better off <b>in</b> <b>the</b> CRU world equilibrium with transfers than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>free</b> trade <b>world</b> equilibrium without transfers...|$|R
