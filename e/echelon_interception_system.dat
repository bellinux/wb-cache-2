50|$|From 11 July 2000 to 6 September 2001, Coelho {{served as}} the {{chairman}} of the Temporary Committee on the <b>ECHELON</b> <b>Interception</b> <b>System.</b>|$|E
50|$|In July 2001, the Temporary Committee on the <b>ECHELON</b> <b>Interception</b> <b>System</b> {{released}} its final report. On 5 September 2001, the European Parliament voted {{to accept the}} committee's report.|$|E
5000|$|ECHELON is {{the name}} popularly given to the signals {{intelligence}} (SIGINT) collection and analysis network operated {{on behalf of the}} five signatory states (so called [...] "Five Eyes" [...] FVEY) to the UKUSA Security Agreement. According to information in a European Parliament document [...] "On the existence of a global <b>system</b> for the <b>interception</b> of private and commercial communications (<b>ECHELON</b> <b>interception</b> system)", <b>ECHELON</b> was ostensibly created to monitor the military and diplomatic communications of the Soviet Union and its Eastern Bloc allies during the Cold War in the early 1960s.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{basic principles}} of lawful <b>interception</b> <b>systems</b> in computer networks and it contains an analysis of various methods of their deception. It also contains a description and implementation of two software tools. The first one is designed to demonstrate {{an attack on the}} lawful <b>interception</b> <b>system.</b> The goal is to deceive the system by hiding a transmitted message in a noise, {{in order to make the}} law enforcement agency interpret a fake message as the real one. The purpose of the second tool is to obtain the original message from data captured by the <b>interception</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Temporary Committee on the <b>ECHELON</b> <b>Interception</b> <b>System</b> was a Committee of the European Parliament {{that was}} set up in 2000 to {{investigate}} the global surveillance network ECHELON. The committee issued its final report in 2001.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, the Temporary Committee on the <b>ECHELON</b> <b>Interception</b> <b>System</b> {{recommended}} to the European Parliament that citizens of member states routinely use cryptography in their communications {{to protect their}} privacy, because economic espionage with ECHELON has been conducted by the U.S. intelligence agencies.|$|E
50|$|On 15 June 2000, the Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament {{proposed}} {{setting up}} a temporary committee on the <b>ECHELON</b> <b>interception</b> <b>system.</b> The goal of the committee was to confirm the existence of ECHELON and to assess the compatibility of such a system with European law.|$|E
50|$|Leuk {{is home to}} one of {{the known}} {{installations}} of Onyx, the Swiss <b>interception</b> <b>system</b> for signals intelligence gathering.|$|R
25|$|The {{technology}} {{developed for}} the HOE system was later used by the SDI and expanded into the Exoatmospheric Reentry-vehicle <b>Interception</b> <b>System</b> (ERIS) program.|$|R
50|$|In 2000, James Woolsey, {{the former}} Director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, {{confirmed}} that U.S. intelligence uses <b>interception</b> <b>systems</b> and keyword searches to monitor European businesses.|$|R
50|$|The program's {{capabilities}} and political implications were investigated {{by a committee}} of the European Parliament during 2000 and 2001 with a report published in 2001. In July 2000, the Temporary Committee on the <b>ECHELON</b> <b>Interception</b> <b>System</b> was established by the European parliament to investigate the surveillance network. It was chaired by the Portuguese politician Carlos Coelho, {{who was in charge}} of supervising investigations throughout 2000 and 2001.|$|E
5000|$|The European Parliament's Temporary Committee on the <b>ECHELON</b> <b>Interception</b> <b>System</b> stated, [...] "It seems likely, {{in view of}} the {{evidence}} and the consistent pattern of statements from a very wide range of individuals and organisations, including American sources, that its name is in fact ECHELON, although this is a relatively minor detail". The U.S. intelligence community uses many code names (see, for example, CIA cryptonym).|$|E
5000|$|In 1988, investigative {{journalist}} Duncan Campbell revealed, {{in an article}} entitled [...] "Somebody's listening" [...] and published in New Statesman, {{the existence of the}} ECHELON surveillance program, an extension of the UKUSA Agreement on global signals intelligence Sigint. He also detailed how the eavesdropping operations worked. Duncan Campbell presented a report commissioned by STOA concerning the ECHELON system, at a [...] "hearing of the Committee on Citizens Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the subject the European Union and data protection" [...] which prompted the European Union to set up the Temporary Committee on the <b>ECHELON</b> <b>Interception</b> <b>System.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ericsson AXE {{telephone}} exchanges support lawful intercepts via the remote-control equipment subsystem (RES), which carries out the tap, and the <b>interception</b> management <b>system</b> (IMS), software used for initiating the tap, which adds the tap to the RES database. In a fully operating lawful <b>interception</b> <b>system</b> the RES and IMS both create logs of all numbers being tapped so that system administrators can perform audits to find unauthorized taps.|$|R

5000|$|On 5 July 2000, the European Union {{set up the}} European Parliament's Temporary Committee on the <b>ECHELON</b> <b>Interception</b> <b>System</b> {{stated that}} the global system for the {{interception}} of private and commercial communications was operating by means of [...] "cooperation proportionate to their capabilities" [...] among the USA, the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand under the UKUSA. ... It seems likely ... that its name is in fact ECHELON." [...] The Committee raised concerns about the incompatibility of the interception of private and commercial communications with the fundamental right to respect for private life (Article 8 of the ECHR). They were also concerned that interception of commercial communications {{could be used for}} [...] "competitive intelligence-gathering rather than combating corruption." [...] During the early 1970s, the first of what became more than eight large satellite communications dishes were installed at Menwith Hill.|$|E
50|$|Hubert Pirker was {{previously}} a member during the 4th and 5th {{terms of the}} European Parliament, beginning in 1996. During this time, he served on the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, the delegation for relations with the Member States of ASEAN, South-east Asia and the Republic of Korea, and the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. In 2000 and 2001 he served on a temporary committee on the <b>Echelon</b> <b>interception</b> <b>system.</b> He substituted for the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment and the delegation for relations with Slovenia. He left the European Parliament in 2004 but became once again a member from 2006 to 2009. He once again entered the European Parliament in March 2011, replacing Ernst Strasser, who resigned after {{his involvement in the}} 2011 cash for influence scandal. Currently {{he is a member of}} the committees on Transport and Tourism and Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.|$|E
50|$|Septier Communication is {{a company}} that {{develops}} and markets advanced telecom solutions for service providers and law enforcement agencies. These include cellular location determination infrastructure, lawful <b>interception</b> <b>systems,</b> fraud management applications, network surveillance products, and a list of call-completion value added services.|$|R
50|$|In modern mobile {{telecommunication}} networks, legal wiretaps, known as lawful interceptions, are {{performed at the}} switch. Ericsson AXE telephone exchanges support lawful intercepts via the remote-control equipment subsystem (RES), which carries out the tap, and the <b>interception</b> management <b>system</b> (IMS), software used for initiating addition of the tap to the RES database. In a fully operating lawful <b>interception</b> <b>system</b> the RES and IMS both create logs of all numbers being tapped, allowing system administrators to perform audits {{in order to find}} unauthorized taps.|$|R
40|$|Modern {{radar and}} {{communications}} systems usually include and {{make use of}} intelligent management of their transmitters output power. The main goals achievable through this function go from interference elimination in systems sharing the same covering range, to configuration of LPI (low probability of <b>interception)</b> <b>systems,</b> wher...|$|R
50|$|Simple {{though the}} <b>interception</b> <b>system</b> was, NJG 1 did obtain {{a certain degree}} of success in 1941. Many future Night Experten would learn their trade in these early days, such as then-Oberleutnant Helmut Lent, who with 6./NJG 1 based at Leeuwarden in the Netherlands, claimed his first kill in March 1941. By the end of 1941 Lent (with 20 kills) and Werner Streib (22 kills) would be the top scorers of NJG 1. However, the need for an {{airborne}} radar <b>interception</b> <b>system</b> became increasingly obvious. The first Ju 88C fighters, equipped with Lichtenstein FuG 202 UHF-band airborne radar were delivered to I./NJG 1 at Venlo early in 1942. This allowed the crews to track a target over a range of 3,500 to 6,100 yards, the image appearing as a 'blip' on two cathode ray tubes.|$|R
50|$|The {{armament}} of the I-75 {{consisted of}} two beam-riding long-range Kaliningrad K-8 missiles. So equipped, I-75 {{became a part of}} the Uragan automated <b>interception</b> <b>system</b> for which it served as a testbed for some time (more research being conducted on the much faster Ye-150 series delta-winged Mach 2.5+ class planes).|$|R
5000|$|According to Duncan Campbell, [...] "In 1999, the Sabana Seca {{field station}} {{appeared}} {{to have at least}} four radomes for satellite communications, one located beside an existing high frequency <b>interception</b> <b>system</b> targeted on Cuban radio communications." [...] According to Richelson, this is the assignment of Detachment 2 of the 544th Intelligence Group.|$|R
5000|$|Created {{decades ago}} to monitor Intelsat {{satellites}} that relay international telephone calls, Urim was expanded to cover maritime communications (Inmarsat), and continued being expanded to intercept more communications satellites. Duncan Campbell, an intelligence specialist speculated that Urim is [...] "akin to the UK-USA pact's <b>Echelon</b> satellite <b>interception</b> ground stations." [...] The Echelon system {{was established by}} the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand as a global network of signal interception stations.|$|R
50|$|The {{base was}} later {{used as an}} {{operations}} base and radio relay site to allow SOG teams to remain in contact while on operations in Laos and to monitor sensors emplaced on the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The base also housed the Army Security Agency's (ASA) Explorer VHF automated <b>interception</b> <b>system</b> linked to the Phu Bai Combat Base.|$|R
50|$|Nächstbereichschutzsystem MANTIS (Modular, Automatic and Network capable Targeting and <b>Interception</b> <b>System),</b> {{formerly}} titled as NBS-C-RAM (counter-rocket, {{artillery and}} mortar), {{is the latest}} very short-range protection system of the German Army, intended for base-protection, particularly in Afghanistan. It is produced by Rheinmetall Air Defence, a subsidiary of Rheinmetall of Germany. It {{is a part of}} the army's future SysFla air-defence project.|$|R
5000|$|A {{modified}} {{and improved}} version of Skyshield with six fully automated turrets, dubbed MANTIS (Modular, Automatic and Network capable Targeting and <b>Interception</b> <b>System)</b> has been {{ordered by the}} German Army as a stationary base defence system. Two systems will be delivered between 2011 and 2012, with more orders being planned {{as a part of}} German Army's future [...] "SysFla" [...] air defence program.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} intercepting communications signals between Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communication systems. To correctly detect a transmitted message {{it is necessary to}} know the gain matrix that represents the channel between the transmitter and the receiver. However, even if the receiver has knowledge of the message symbol set, it may not be possible to estimate the channel matrix. Blind Source Separation (BSS) techniques, such as Independent Component Analysis (ICA) can go some way to extracting independent signals from individual transmission antennae but these may have been preprocessed in a manner unknown to the receiver. In this paper we {{consider the}} situation where a communications <b>interception</b> <b>system</b> has prior knowledge of the message symbol set, the channel matrix between the transmission <b>system</b> and the <b>interception</b> <b>system</b> and is able to resolve the transmissionss from independent antennae. The question then becomes: what is the mutual information available to the interceptor when an unknown unitary transformation matrix is employed by the transmitter...|$|R
5000|$|On April 30, 2008, three Plowshares activists {{entered the}} GCSB Waihopai base near Blenheim, New Zealand and {{punctured}} an inflated radome {{used in the}} <b>ECHELON</b> signal <b>interception</b> program, causing $1.2 million in damages. In March 2010 the three men stood trial by jury at the District Court in Wellington and were acquitted. [...] The New Zealand Attorney-General then lodged a civil claim, {{on behalf of the}} GCSB, for $1.2 million. This claim was dropped in February 2014.|$|R
50|$|A similar {{organisation}} {{began in}} the Military Intelligence department of the War Office, which become known as MI1b, and Colonel Macdonagh proposed that the two organisations should work together, decoding messages concerning the Western Front. A sophisticated <b>interception</b> <b>system</b> (known as 'Y' service), together with {{the post office and}} Marconi receiving stations grew rapidly to the point it could intercept almost all official German messages.|$|R
40|$|Most {{publications}} discussing missile <b>interception</b> <b>systems</b> {{assume a}} zero computer response time. This thesis studies {{the impact of}} computer response time on single-missile single-target and multiple- missile multiple-target systems. Simulation results for the final miss distance as the computer response time increases are presented. A simple online cooperative adjustment model for multiple-missile multiple-target system is created {{for the purpose of}} studying the computer delay effect...|$|R
