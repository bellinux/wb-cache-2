Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of active (treadmill walking) and passive (<b>infrared</b> <b>radiator)</b> warming of the foot sole on vibration perception thresholds. Methods Sixty healthy and injury-free subjects voluntarily participated in this study. Vibration perception thresholds (200 Hz) and plantar temperatures were measured at the hallux and 1 st metatarsal head. In experiment 1, warming and mechanically stimulating the skin was achieved by walking on a treadmill for 30 min. In a follow-up study (experiment 2), external plantar heat was administered via an <b>infrared</b> <b>radiator</b> (30 min). Results In both experiments, increasing temperatures led to increased plantar sensitivity. However, the amount of improved sensitivity was greater in experiment 1, although plantar temperature increases were lower compared to experiment 2. Conclusions Warming in conjunction with mechanical stimulation seems to have a greater potential to enhance plantar sensitivity compared to external heat supply only.

40|$|Abstract—Manufacturing {{components}} of fiber-reinforced thermoplastics requires three steps: heating the matrix, forming and {{consolidation of the}} composite and terminal cooling the matrix. For the heating process a pre-determined temperature distribution through the layers and {{the thickness of the}} pre-consolidated sheets is recommended to enable forming mechanism. Thus, a design for the heating process for forming composites with thermoplastic matrices is necessary. To obtain a constant temperature through thickness and width of the sheet, the heating process was analyzed by the help of the finite element method. The simulation models were validated by experiments with resistance thermometers as well as with an infrared camera. Based on the finite element simulation, heating methods for infrared radiators have been developed. Using the numeric simulation many iteration loops are required to determine the process parameters. Hence, the initiation of a model for calculating relevant process parameters started applying regression functions.

40|$|We {{demonstrated}} a new silicon microchannel heat sink, composing of parallel longitudinal microchannels and several transverse microchannels, which separate the whole flow length into several independent zones, {{in which the}} thermal boundary layer is in developing. The redeveloping flow is repeated {{for all of the}} independent zones thus the overall heat transfer is greatly enhanced. Meanwhile, the pressure drops are decreased compared with the conventional microchannel heat sink. Both benefits of enhanced heat transfer and decreased pressure drop ensure the possibility to use "larger" hydraulic diameter of the microchannels so that less pumping power is needed, which are attractive for high heat flux chip cooling. The above idea fulfilled in microscale is verified by a set of experiments. The local chip temperature and Nusselt numbers are obtained using a high resolution <b>Infrared</b> <b>Radiator</b> Imaging system.

40|$|Global {{warming and}} land-use change could have {{profound}} impacts on ecosystem carbon (C) fluxes, with consequent changes in C sequestration and its feedback to climate change. However, {{it is not}} well understood how net ecosystem C exchange (NEE) and its components respond to warming and mowing in tallgrass prairie. We conducted two warming experiments, one long term with a 1. 7 A degrees C increase in a C- 4 -dominated grassland (Experiment 1), and one short term with a 2. 8 A degrees C increase in a C- 3 -dominated grassland (Experiment 2), to investigate main and interactive effects of warming and clipping on ecosystem C fluxes in the Great Plains of North America during 2009 - 2011. An <b>infrared</b> <b>radiator</b> was used to simulate climate warming and clipping once a year mimicked mowing in both experiments. The results showed that warming significantly increased ecosystem respiration (ER), slightly increased GPP, with the net outcome (NEE) being little changed in Experiment 1. In contrast, warming significantly suppressed GPP and ER in both years, with the net outcome being enhanced in NEE (more C sequestration) in 2009 - 2010 in Experiment 2. The C- 4 -dominated grassland showed a much higher optimum temperature for C fluxes than the C- 3 -dominated grassland, which may partly contribute to the different warming effects in the two experiments. Clipping significantly enhanced GPP, ER, and NEE in both experiments but did not significantly interact with warming in impacting C fluxes in either experiment. The warming-induced changes in ecosystem C fluxes correlated significantly with C- 4 biomass proportion but not with warming-induced changes in either soil temperature or soil moisture across the plots in the experiments.

50|$|Adequate cooling of {{the surface}} {{typically}} takes place when it loses more energy by infrared radiation than it receives as solar radiation from the sun, which is especially the case on clear nights. Poor thermal conductivity restricts the replacement of such losses from deeper ground layers, which are typically warmer at night.Preferred objects of dew formation are thus poor conducting or well isolated from the ground, and non-metallic, while shiny metal coated surfaces are poor <b>infrared</b> <b>radiators.</b> Preferred weather conditions include the absence of clouds and little water vapor in the higher atmosphere to minimize greenhouse effects and sufficient humidity of the air near the ground. Typical dew nights are classically considered calm, because the wind transports (nocturnally) warmer air from higher levels to the cold surface. However, if the atmosphere is {{the major source of}} moisture (this type is called dewfall), a certain amount of ventilation is needed to replace the vapor that is already condensed. The highest optimum wind speeds could be found on arid islands. If the wet soil beneath is the major source of vapor, however (this type of dew formation is called distillation), wind always seems adverse.|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe aim of {{this paper}} is to give a concise {{description}} of hyperthermia and a brief review of its clinical applications. Hyperthermia (HT, thermal therapy) is thought to be one of the cancer therapies and is considered to be an artificial way of increasing the body tissue temperature by delivering heat obtained from external sources to destroy cancerous cells or prevent their further growth. The first principles of hyperthermic biology are presented. The phenomena of thermotolerance and radiosensitization are briefly described, as well as the concept of thermal dose delivered to the tissues. Three main clinical applications of HT are presented. They include local, regional or part-body HT and whole-body HT that deliver heat to localized, advanced or deep-seated and disseminated malignancies, respectively, depending on location, depth and staging of the tumour. Energies used to apply heat to the tumour include microwaves, radiofrequency energy, ultrasound, <b>infrared</b> <b>radiators</b> and different kinds of hot sources (hot water, ferromagnetic seeds, nanoparticles, resistive implants). General indications for each HT subtype and possible combinations of HT with other cancer treatment modalities are presented. Substantially, HT is used as an adjuvant therapy and in such a role it is being evaluated in many clinical randomized trials throughout the scientific medical centres. Their first preliminary results are already available, but still time is needed to produce firm conclusions and strict indications for hyperthermia treatment...|$|R
40|$|Microscale boiling heat {{transfer}} experiments were performed using acetone as the working fluid in ten parallel silicon microchannels with hydraulic diameters of 155. 4 mum. An <b>infrared</b> <b>radiator</b> image system {{is used for the}} chip temperature measurements, while an optical system combining a microscope and a high-speed camera is used for transient flow pattern identification. By covering the present data range it is found that all microchannels repeat the transient flow patterns in a timescale of milliseconds while the fluid pressures/temperatures are stable. A full cycle can be subdivided into three substages: liquid refilling stage, bubble nucleation, growth and coalescence stage, and transient annular flow stage. Correspondingly four flow patterns are identified. Paired or triplet bubbles are observed to be nucleated and grow up simultaneously in, or very close to, the channel corners at the same cross section. The nucleated bubbles experience several milliseconds of growth until coalescence takes place. Then a single liquid plug is separated into two parts, which are pushed out of the flow field view in less than 1 ms. In the transient annular flow stage, the liquid films that are drawn into the comers of the channel become less and less versus time. Once a partially or fully dried-out state is reached, all the microchannels are refilled with fresh liquid and a new cycle begins. The probabilities of each flow pattern occurring and the liquid refilling follow the statistical principle well. The measured chip temperatures are not uniform across the whole heating area, attributed to the uneven liquid refilling probabilities for different channels and the uneven possibilities that are immersed in the liquid for different heating regions. The chip temperatures display spatial variation behavior in the majority of the heating area, due to the liquid and vapor alternatively passing through the microchannels. To the authors' knowledge, some of the above experimental findings have not been previously reported...|$|E

In this article, boiling heat transfer experiments in 10 silicon triangular microchannels with the hydraulic diameter of 55. 4 mu m were performed using acetone as the working fluid, having the inlet liquid temperatures of 24 - 40 degrees C, mass fluxes of 96 - 360 kg/m(2) s, heat fluxes of 140 - 420 kW/m(2), and exit vapor mass qualities of 0. 28 - 0. 70. The above data range correspond to the boiling number from 1. 574 x 10 (- 3) to 3. 219 x 10 (- 3) and ensure the perfect nucleate boiling heat transfer region, providing a very uniform chip temperature distribution in both streamline and transverse directions. The boiling heat transfer coefficients determined by the <b>infrared</b> <b>radiator</b> image system were found to he dependent on the heat Axes only, not dependent on the mass Axes and the vapor mass qualities covering the above data range. The high-speed flow visualization shows that the periodic flow patterns take place inside the microchannel in the time scale of milliseconds, consisting of liquid refilling stage, bubble nucleation, growth and coalescence stage, and transient liquid film evaporation stage in a full cycle. The paired or triplet bubble nucleation sites can occur in the microchannel corners anywhere along the flow direction, accounting for the nucleate boiling heat transfer mode. The periodic boiling process {{is similar to a}} series of bubble nucleation, growth, and departure followed by the liquid refilling in a single cavity for the pool boiling situation. The chip temperature difference across the whole two-phase area is found to he small in a couple of degrees, providing a better thermal management scheme for the high heat flux electronic components.

40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} {{is currently}} {{the most widely used}} construction material. The wide field of applications forces the usage of the advanced techniques for quality control and tests of these structures. Most frequently it is required, that such tests should be possible to perform after the reinforced concrete hardening, during its usage and without damaging the structure. Therefore, various non-destructive testing techniques are here the natural choice. There are several aspects of possible non-destructive evaluation of reinforced concrete structures. One of them is the detection and assessment of the rebars. The authors propose here selected active thermography techniques. In case of the active thermography, an external energy source has to be used to induce the thermal response of the tested specimen. For concrete structures heating source based on the radiation phenomena (like halogen lamps, flash lamps, <b>infrared</b> <b>radiators</b> and similar) may be not effective due to, usually, large size of the examined structures. Therefore, authors propose two different heating techniques: a microwave heating and an induction heating. The microwave heating has volumetric character and its ratio depends not only on thermal properties of the material, but also on electrical properties. In case of metals (rebars made of a steel) microwave heating is not effective, thus the colder spots observed on the specimens’ surface will indicate presence of the rebars. On the contrary, the induction heating, generates the heat by eddy currents only in the metal objects. The hot spots will indicate the rebars’ positions. In this article authors will present selected experimental results, which will allow to evaluate and compare the proposed two techniques of heating suitability of each one to assess the reinforced concrete by using the active thermography will be discussed...|$|R

This study was to compare the dried products of galangal by using air-drying, vacuum-drying and far-infrared vacuum-drying. Experimental results demonstrate that far-Infrared vacuum-drying could obtain better quality and drying efficiency in the galangal drying. This research used three-variable and three-level design method to set up 15 groups of experimental conditions to optimize the parameters of far-infrared vacuum-drying. An analysis by response surface methodology (RSM) was performed. The three independent variables studied were the temperature of far <b>infrared</b> <b>radiator</b> (FIR) (X 1), the thickness of sample (X 2), and the distance between the far-infrared radiator and the sample (X 3). The response variables studied included total color difference (ΔE), Hunter-L,Hunter-a,Hunter-b,rehydration ratio,hardness,drying time,sensory properties of appearance,aroma,taste. The % variability explained (R 2) of total color difference (ΔE), Hunter-L,Hunter-a,hardness,drying time,sensory properties of appearance,aroma,taste are all over 80 %, The highest % variability explained is drying time (R 2 = 98 %). These results indicates that all these response variables were comply with this regression analysis. The effect of thickness of the sample and the temperature of FIR radiator were more significant among these three independent variables. As the temperature of the FIR became higher and the thickness of the sample got thinner, the drying time was shorter with higher total color difference (ΔE). When temperature decreased and thickness became thinner, the hardness of the product and sensory property of aroma increased. It was found that the quadratic model of Hunter-a was not significant and this model was not applicable. The best drying conditions for far-infrared vacuum-drying were found to be drying time less than 5. 2 hours, hardness below 9. 0 g/mm 2, aroma evaluation above 7. 4 and appearance evaluation above 5. 1. The overlapping area was located at the set temperature of FIR at 51 - 54 ℃, sample thickness 5 - 6 mm. Verification results showed that the use of quadratic equations to simulate drying time、thickness、sensory property of aroma is acceptable. 南薑(galangal) 為沙茶醬中的一種重要香辛料。本研究比較熱風乾燥、真空乾燥及遠紅外線真空乾燥，三種方式來乾燥南薑；發現使用遠紅外線真空乾燥，可提高乾燥效率且保留較佳品質。此外，利用反應曲面法之三因子三階層實驗設計，設定了 15 組的條件組合來進行試驗，以探討遠紅外線真空乾燥南薑之最適製作條件。三個獨立變數為遠紅外線加熱器設定溫度(X 1) 、樣品之厚度(X 2) 及遠紅外線加熱器和樣品表面之距離(X 3) ；而反應變數則包括總色差（△E）、Hunter-L、Hunter-a、Hunter-b、復水性、硬度、乾燥時間、感官品評外觀、風味及口感，以找出遠紅外線真空乾燥南薑最適製作條件。數據結果顯示在以遠紅外線真空乾燥處理下，總色差（△E）、Hunter-L、Hunter-a、硬度、乾燥時間、感官品評外觀及風味的可解釋之變異度皆達到 80 ％以上，其中最高的為乾燥時間（R 2 ＝ 98 ％）， 此表示這些反應變數適合所採用的迴歸分析，而且模式欠合性並不顯著，因此迴歸出來的模式相當合適。在三項獨立變數中，皆以樣品之厚度與遠紅外線加熱器設定溫度這兩個變因較為顯著，其影響趨勢為遠紅外線照射溫度越高且樣品厚度越薄時，可得到越短的乾燥時間及較高的總色差（△E）。溫度下降，厚度越薄，則可使產品硬度、感官品評風味呈上升趨勢。而Hunter-a以二次多項式表示時，其整體模式不具顯著效果，所以此模式不適用。遠紅外線真空乾燥之最適乾燥條件於乾燥時間小於 5. 2 小時、硬度小於 9. 0 g/mm 2 、感官品評風味大於 7. 4 及感官品評外觀大於 5. 1 之間，有一重疊區域（斜線部份），其遠紅外線設定的溫度為 51 - 54 ℃，樣品厚度為 5 - 6 mm。經驗證試驗發現，用來模擬乾燥時間、硬度、感官品評風味、外觀所使用的二次多項式模式是可以被接受的。頁次 壹、前言……………………………………………………………	 1 貳、文獻整理………………………………………………………	 3 一、薑…………………………………………………………	 3 (一) 薑的簡介……………………………………………	 3 (二) 薑的辣味成分………………………………………	 6 (三) 薑之藥理活性之介紹………………………………	 8 (四) 南薑………………………………………………… 10 (五) 南薑加工性………………………………………… 14 二、乾燥……………………………………………………… 16 (一) 熱風乾燥…………………………………………… 20 (二) 真空乾燥…………………………………………… 21 三、遠紅外線………………………………………………… 24 (一) 波長範圍…………………………………………… 24 (二) 遠紅外線加熱之特性……………………………… 24 (三) 遠紅外線在食品工業上之應用…………………… 27 四、反應曲面法……………………………………………… 34 (一) 反應曲面法的原理………………………………… 34 (二) 反應曲面法的特點………………………………… 36 五、食品組織的物理特性…………………………………… 39 六、感官品評的測試………………………………………… 42 參、研究目的……………………………………………………… 44 肆、材料與方法…………………………………………………… 45 一、試驗材料………………………………………………… 45 二、試驗流程………………………………………………… 46 三、試驗方法………………………………………………… 47 (一) 南薑樣品的製備…………………………………… 47 (二) 厚度量測…………………………………………… 47 (三) 乾燥方法…………………………………………… 47 (四) 測定項目…………………………………………… 51 (五) 實驗設計…………………………………………… 55 伍、結果與討論…………………………………………………… 60 一、遠紅外線真空乾燥與其他乾燥方式的比較…………… 60 (一) 乾燥時間與品質之比較…………………………… 60 (二) 組織構造之比較…………………………………… 69 二、反應曲面模式分析……………………………………… 71 三、反應曲面方程式………………………………………… 80 四、各應變數之結果分析…………………………………… 86 (一) 對顏色的影響……………………………………… 86 (二) 硬度………………………………………………… 90 (三) 乾燥時間…………………………………………… 90 (四) 感官品評…………………………………………… 90 (五) 最適化條件之探討………………………………… 94 (六) 驗證試驗…………………………………………… 95 陸、結論…………………………………………………………… 99 柒、中文摘要……………………………………………………… 101 捌、英文摘要……………………………………………………… 102 玖、參考文獻……………………………………………………… 10...|$|E

In the region 0. 1 - 1 mbar, temperatures are 7 K colder at 50 degrees N than at 53 degrees S and the difference reaches approximately 13 K at 5 mbar.

Cooling rate profiles have been computed at the two locations, using the gas and haze abundances derived from the IRIS measurements. We find that, despite lower temperatures, the cooling rate profiles in the pressure range 0. 15 - 5 mbar are 20 to 40 % larger in the north than in the south, because of the enhanced concentrations of <b>infrared</b> <b>radiators.</b> Because the northern hemisphere appears darker than the southern one in the Voyager images, enhanced solar heating is also expected to take place at 50 degrees N. Solar heating rate profiles have been calculated, with two different assumptions on the origin of the hemispheric asymmetry. In the most likely case where it results from a variation in the absorbance of the haze material, the heating rates are found to be 12 - 15 % larger at the northern location than at the southern one, a smaller increase than that in the cooling rates. If the lower albedo in the north results from an increase in the particle number density, a 55 to 75 % difference is found for the pressure range 0. 15 - 5 mbar, thus larger than that calculated for the cooling rates. Considering the uncertainties in the haze model, dynamical heat transport may significantly contribute to the meridional temperature gradients observed in the stratosphere. On the other hand, the latitudinal variation in gas and haze composition may be sufficient to explain the entire temperature asymmetry observed, without invoking a lag in the thermal response of the atmosphere due to dynamical inertia...|$|R
40|$|When {{restoring}} monumental churches (the renewal of) {{the heating}} {{system has to}} be taken into account. In older times different types of heating systems were installed, varying from warm or hot air heating to floor heating, (<b>infrared)</b> radiant heating, <b>radiator</b> panel and convector heating and local or pew heating. From literature there is evidence that some of these heating systems caused serious damage to church organs and other valuable church interior parts. In this paper performance requirements for church heating systems will be presented with respect to preservation, energy requirements, thermal comfort and aesthetics. Computer simulation models and (measurement) tools have been used to evaluate and design heating systems, including control systems and strategies, for churches...|$|R

An outer edge periphery of the plate is increased by 25 percentages when compared to an edge periphery of the body, where the plate is made of silicon carbide ceramics and/or silicon nitride ceramics. The structurings correspond to a form and a size of ducts of the plate in a longitudinal section of the body, where a ceramic material of the body has an open porosity of less than 10 percentages. USE - Plate-shaped ceramic heat radiating body for an <b>infrared</b> surface <b>radiator</b> that is utilized in a drying system for drying a paper web or a cardboard web or for heating a building or a hall. ADVANTAGE - The outer edge periphery of the ceramic plate is increased by 25 percentages when compared to the edge periphery of the plate-shaped ceramic heat radiating body, thus increasing emissivity and oxidation stability of the radiator and increasing resistance against crack formation. The design of the body increases lifespan of the plate and reduces stability of the plate while increasing elasticity of the plate...|$|R

A simulation experiment by farm warming with <b>infrared</b> ray <b>radiator</b> was carried out, and the result showed photosynthesis of broad bean was significantly faster than transpiration during the seedling stage, ramifying stage, budding stage, blooming stage and podding stage when the temperate was increased by 0. 5 – 1. 5 °C. But broad bean transpiration was faster than photosynthesis during the budding stage, blooming stage and podding stage when the temperature was increased by 1. 5 °C above. The number of grain per hill and hundred-grain weight were significantly increased when the temperature was increased by 0. 5 – 1. 0 °C. But they significantly dropped and finally the yield decreased when the temperature was increased by 1. 0 °C above. The broad bean yield decreased by 39. 2 – 88. 4 % when the temperature was increased by 1. 5 – 2. 0 °C. The broad bean water use efficiency increased and then decreased with temperature rising. The water use efficiency increased when the temperature was increased by 1. 0 °C below, and it quickly decreased when the temperature was increased by 1. 0 °C above. In all, global warming in the future will significantly influence the growth, yield and water use efficiency of bean cultures in China’s semiarid regions...|$|R
40|$|A {{document}} {{describes a}} three-stage passive radiative cooler for a cryogenic spectrometer {{to be launched}} into a low orbit around the Moon. This cooler is relatively lightweight and compact, and its basic design is scalable and otherwise adaptable to other applications {{in which there are}} requirements for cooling instrumentation in orbit about planets. The cooler includes multiple lightweight flat radiator blades alternating with cylindrical parabolic <b>infrared</b> reflectors. The <b>radiator</b> blades are oriented at an angle chosen to prevent infrared loading from the Moon limb at the intended orbital altitude and attitude. The reflectors are shaped and oriented to position their foci outside the radiator surfaces. There are six radiator-blade/reflector pairs - two pairs for each stage of cooling. The radiator blades and reflectors are coated on their front and back surfaces with materials having various infrared emissivities, infrared reflectivities, and solar reflectivities so as to maximize infrared radiation to cold outer space and minimize inadvertent solar heating. The radiator blades and reflectors are held in place by a lightweight support structure, the components of which are designed to satisfy a complex combination of thermal and mechanical requirements...|$|R
40|$|The optimum {{radiator}} configuration in hot lunar thermal environments is one {{in which}} the radiator is parallel to the ground and has no view to the hot lunar surface. However, typical spacecraft configurations have limited real estate available for top-mounted radiators, resulting in a desire to use the spacecraft s vertically oriented sides. Vertically oriented, flat panel radiators will have a large view factor to the lunar surface, and thus will be subjected to significant incident lunar <b>infrared</b> heat. Consequently, <b>radiator</b> fluid temperatures will need to exceed approx. 325 K (assuming standard spacecraft radiator optical properties) in order to provide positive heat rejection at lunar noon. Such temperatures are too high for crewed spacecraft applications in which a heat pump is to be avoided. A recent study of vertically oriented radiator configurations subjected to lunar noon thermal environments led to the discovery of a novel radiator concept that yielded positive heat rejection at lower fluid temperatures. This radiator configuration, called the Upright Lunar Terrain Radiator Assembly (ULTRA), has exhibited superior performance to all previously analyzed concepts in terms of heat rejection in the lunar noon thermal environment. A key benefit of the ULTRA is the absence of louvers or other moving parts and its simple geometry. Analysis of the ULTRA for a lunar extravehicular activity (EVA) portable life support system (PLSS) is shown to provide moderate heat rejection, on average, at all solar incident angles assuming an average radiator temperature of 294 K, whereas prior concepts exhibited insignificant heat rejection or heat absorption at higher incident angles. The performance of the ULTRA for a lunar lander is also discussed and compared to the performance of a vertically oriented, flat panel radiator at various lunar latitudes...|$|R

ITIR consists of a specularly reflective shielding surface and a diffuse radiating surface joined to form a horizontally oriented V-shape (shielding surface on top). The point of intersection of these surfaces is defined by two angles, those which define the tilt of each surface with respect to the local horizontal. The optimum set of these angles is determined on a case-by-case basis. The idea assumes minimal conductive heat transfer between shielding and radiating surfaces, and a practical design would likely stack sets of these surfaces {{on top of one another}} to reduce radiator thickness...|$|R
