5|$|Fifth Avenue roughly bisects Manhattan Island {{and acts}} as the <b>demarcation</b> line for east/west designations (e.g., East 27th Street, West 42nd Street); street {{addresses}} start at Fifth Avenue and increase heading away from Fifth Avenue, {{at a rate of}} 100 per block on most streets. South of Waverly Place, Fifth Avenue terminates and Broadway becomes the east/west <b>demarcation</b> line. Though the grid does start with 1st Street, just north of Houston Street (the southernmost street divided in west and east portions; pronounced HOW-stin), the grid does not fully take hold until north of 14th Street, where nearly all east-west streets are numerically identified, which increase from south to north to 220th Street, the highest numbered street on the island. Streets in Midtown are usually one-way, with the few exceptions generally being the busiest cross-town thoroughfares (14th, 23rd, 34th, and 42nd Streets, for example), which are bidirectional across the width of Manhattan Island. The rule of thumb is that odd-numbered streets run west, while even-numbered streets run east.|$|E

5|$|Some other {{anatomical}} distinction {{exists between}} the larvae of the Nematocera and the Brachycera. Especially in the Brachycera, little <b>demarcation</b> is seen between the thorax and abdomen, though the <b>demarcation</b> may be visible in many Nematocera, such as mosquitoes; in the Brachycera, {{the head of the}} larva is not clearly distinguishable {{from the rest of the}} body, and few, if any, sclerites are present. Informally, such brachyceran larvae are called maggots, but the term is not technical and often applied indifferently to fly larvae or insect larvae in general. The eyes and antennae of brachyceran larvae are reduced or absent, and the abdomen also lacks appendages such as cerci. This lack of features is an adaptation to food such as carrion, decaying detritus, or host tissues surrounding endoparasites. Nematoceran larvae generally have well-developed eyes and antennae, while those of Brachyceran larvae are reduced or modified.|$|E

5|$|Factors {{in favour}} of Croatia's {{preservation}} of its pre-war borders were the Yugoslav Federal Constitution Amendments of 1971, and the Yugoslav Federal Constitution of 1974. The 1971 amendments introduced a concept that sovereign rights were exercised by the federal units, and that the federation had only the authority specifically transferred to it by the constitution. The 1974 Constitution confirmed and strengthened the principles introduced in 1971. The borders had been defined by <b>demarcation</b> commissions in 1947, pursuant to decisions of AVNOJ in 1943 and 1945 regarding the federal organization of Yugoslavia.|$|E

5|$|In mid-May, Operation Trio was {{followed}} by the joint Italian-Chetnik offensive against Partisan detachments within the Italian zone of occupation in eastern Herzegovina and Montenegro, with similar effects: the Partisans lost almost all of the liberated territory in these areas. This offensive is also considered part of the Third Enemy Offensive in Yugoslav historiography. After Operation Trio, NDH forces remained south of the <b>demarcation</b> line between the German and Italian zones of occupation, in spite of protests from the Italians.|$|E

5|$|In {{the closing}} days of World War I, the Conference of Ambassadors drew the first <b>demarcation</b> line between Poland and Lithuania on June 18, 1919. The line {{satisfied}} no one, and Polish troops continued to advance {{deeper into the}} Lithuanian-controlled territory. These attacks coincided with {{the signing of the}} Treaty of Versailles on June 28, which eliminated any danger from Germany. Attempting to halt further hostilities, Marshal of France Ferdinand Foch proposed a new line, known as the Foch Line, on July 18, 1919.|$|E
5|$|Lumsden {{served as}} Chief of Staff to the commander-in-chief, General Sir F. P. Haines, during the Second Anglo-Afghan War, {{for which he}} {{received}} the Order of the Bath. In 1884, Lumsden returned to the North-West frontier, when he was selected as British representative on the Anglo-Russian Commission for the <b>demarcation</b> of the north-west boundary of Afghanistan, but resigned and returned to England in 1885 after the Panjdeh Incident. He left London to represent the British at negotiations with Russia in selecting the Afghan Frontier Commission to determine the Afghan boundary.|$|E
5|$|One {{prevailing}} {{idea is that}} carnivory {{in plants}} is not {{a black and white}} duality, but rather a spectrum from strict non-carnivorous photoautotrophs (a rose, for example) to fully carnivorous plants with active trapping mechanisms like those of Dionaea or Aldrovanda. However, passive traps are still considered fully carnivorous. Plants that fall between the definitions in the strict carnivorous/non-carnivorous <b>demarcation</b> can be defined as being protocarnivorous.|$|E

5|$|Significant {{delays in}} {{finalising}} arrangements for Operation Trio {{were caused by}} disagreements regarding where it would commence, who would be in command, the involvement of Chetniks and NDH forces, {{how to deal with}} the <b>demarcation</b> line between the German and Italian zones of occupation, and what local authorities would be put in place as localities were cleared of insurgents. The NDH contributed to the mutual suspicion between the Germans and Italians. The Italian demands prevailed, because they were committing larger forces to the operation. The decision was ultimately made to target all insurgents in eastern Bosnia between Sarajevo and the Drina. Throughout the preparation for Operation Trio, the Italians looked for opportunities to cross over the <b>demarcation</b> line and expand their sphere of influence into eastern Bosnia to take advantage of German weakness in the NDH. Bader's final orders for the operation granted several key Italian demands, including military control over civil affairs in the area of operations, fair treatment of the local population, and treating non-resisting Chetniks as prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|The Polish {{government}} {{agreed to}} Beck's proposal, and the ultimatum was toned down. However, {{at the same}} time, Beck ordered military preparations. Poland assembled four divisions along the <b>demarcation</b> line; about 50,000 Polish troops were present, and just over 20,000 Lithuanian troops. The Polish troops were reinforced by armored vehicles, by two air force regiments, consisting of about one hundred aircraft, and by the Polish fleet {{in the waters of}} the Baltic Sea along the Lithuanian shore.|$|E
5|$|The <b>demarcation</b> between {{carnivorous}} and protocarnivorous is blurred by {{the lack}} of a strict definition of botanical carnivory and ambiguous academic literature on the subject. Many examples of protocarnivorous plants exist, some of which are counted among the ranks of true carnivorous plants as a matter of historical preference. Further research into these plants' carnivorous adaptations may reveal that a few protocarnivorous plants do meet the more rigid definition of a carnivorous plant.|$|E
