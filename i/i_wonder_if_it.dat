5|$|I can quite {{understand}} the Prince of Wales being much annoyed at his son's name being {{coupled with the}} thing {{but that was the}} case before I left it... we were both accused of going to this place but not together... they will end by having out in open court exactly what they are all trying to keep quiet. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> is really a fact or only an invention of that arch ruffian H.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Douglas {{attended}} a meeting addressing conservation of the Everglades in Everglades City, and was observed by John Rothchild: Mrs. Douglas was {{half the size}} of her fellow speakers and she wore huge dark glasses, which along with the huge floppy hat made her look like Scarlett O'Hara as played by Igor Stravinsky. When she spoke, everybody stopped slapping mosquitoes and more or less came to order. She reminded us all of our responsibility to nature and I don't remember what else. Her voice had the sobering effect of a one-room schoolmarm's. The tone itself seemed to tame the rowdiest of the local stone crabbers, plus the developers, and the lawyers on both sides. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> didn't also intimidate the mosquitoes... The request for a Corps of Engineers permit was eventually turned down. This was no surprise to those of us who'd heard her speak.|$|E
500|$|Prince Albert Victor died in 1892, but society {{gossip about}} his sex life continued. Sixty {{years after the}} scandal the {{official}} biographer of King George V, Harold Nicolson, was told by Lord Goddard, who was a twelve-year-old schoolboy {{at the time of}} the scandal, that Prince Albert Victor [...] "had been involved in a male brothel scene, and that a solicitor had to commit perjury to clear him. The solicitor was struck off the rolls for his offence, but was thereafter reinstated." [...] In fact, none of the lawyers involved in the case was convicted of perjury or struck off at the time, indeed most had very distinguished careers. However, Arthur Newton was struck off for 12 months for professional misconduct in 1910 after falsifying letters from another of his clients—the notorious murderer Harvey Crippen. In 1913, he was struck off indefinitely and sentenced to three years' imprisonment for obtaining money by false pretences. Newton may have invented and spread the rumours about Prince Albert Victor in an attempt to protect his clients from prosecution by forcing a cover-up. State papers on the case in the Public Record Office, released to the public in the 1970s, provide no information on the prince's involvement other than Newton's threat to implicate him. Hamilton Cuffe wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions, Sir Augustus Stephenson, [...] "I am told that Newton has boasted that if we go on a very distinguished person will be involved (PAV). I don't mean to say that I for one instant credit it—but in such circumstances as this one never knows what may be said, be concocted or be true." [...] Surviving private letters from Somerset to his friend Lord Esher, confirm that Somerset knew of the rumours but did not know if they were true. He writes, [...] "I can quite understand the Prince of Wales being much annoyed at his son's name being coupled with the thing... we were both accused of going to this place but not together... <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> is really a fact or only an invention." [...] In his correspondence, Sir Dighton Probyn refers to [...] "cruel and unjust rumours with regard to PAV" [...] and [...] "false reports dragging PAV's name into the sad story". When Prince Albert Victor's name appeared in the American press, the New York Herald published an anonymous letter, almost certainly written by Charles Hall, saying [...] "there is not, and never was, the slightest excuse for mentioning the name of Prince Albert Victor." [...] Biographers who believe the rumours suppose that Prince Albert Victor was bisexual, but this is strongly contested by others who refer to him as [...] "ardently heterosexual" [...] and his involvement in the rumours as [...] "somewhat unfair".|$|E
