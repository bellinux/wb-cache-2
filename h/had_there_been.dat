5|$|Enron's {{aggressive}} {{accounting practices}} were not {{hidden from the}} board of directors, as later learned by a Senate subcommittee. The board was informed of the rationale for using the Whitewing, LJM, and Raptor transactions, and after approving them, received status updates on the entities' operations. Although not all of Enron's widespread improper accounting practices were revealed to the board, the practices were dependent on board decisions. Even though Enron extensively relied on derivatives for its business, the company's Finance Committee and board {{did not have enough}} experience with derivatives to understand what they were being told. The Senate subcommittee argued that <b>had</b> <b>there</b> <b>been</b> a detailed understanding of how the derivatives were organized, the board would have prevented their use.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} {{offensive}} captured {{a portion of}} the targeted area, including the town of Lipik as the first of the larger settlements captured by the HV during the war, the mission objectives were not met before the ceasefire took effect. SAO Western Slavonia retained control of the town of Okučani and its surroundings, including a short section of the Zagreb–Slavonski Brod motorway. The halting of Operation Hurricane-91 due to the ceasefire of 3 January 1992 led to opposing assessments on the possible outcomes of the offensive <b>had</b> <b>there</b> <b>been</b> no ceasefire. Assessments range from claims that the JNA was on the brink of defeat in the area, to estimates that the HV was too exhausted and its ammunition stocks too low to permit a successful conclusion of the offensive. The three HV offensives launched in Western Slavonia in late-1991 led to the displacement of approximately 20,000 Croatian Serb refugees who were later settled in the JNA-held Baranja region in eastern Croatia.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the High Court ruling, and with the {{appropriation}} bills due to be considered by the Senate on 16 October, Fraser was undecided whether to block supply. His biographer, Philip Ayres, contends that, <b>had</b> <b>there</b> <b>been</b> no further government scandals, he would not have done so. Khemlani, however, had alleged - contrary to government statements - that Connor had never revoked his authority to obtain loans and had been in regular contact with him even into mid-1975. On 13 October, the Melbourne Herald printed documents in support of Khemlani's allegations, and on the following day, Connor resigned. Fraser determined to block supply, convened a shadow cabinet meeting and received the unanimous support of the Coalition frontbench. At a press conference, Fraser cited the poor state of the economy and the continuing scandals as reasons for his decision. Without the passage of fresh appropriations, supply would be exhausted on 30 November.|$|E
5|$|Negative {{effects of}} the coast trade on the native peoples of the Northwest {{included}} waves of epidemic disease, smallpox worst of all. Other health problems included the spread of alcoholism, tuberculosis, venereal diseases including syphilis, and sterility. The coast trade also promoted and enhanced the pre-existing system of native slavery and native slave trading. The overall number of slaves increased, as did their distribution and exploitation. Despite these negative effects, the North West Coast natives were largely spared the additional effects that would have come <b>had</b> <b>there</b> <b>been</b> more permanent posts, political administration, missionizing, and colonization. The early traders were mostly seasonal visitors and the later HBC posts were few and small. Missionization and direct colonial rule over the coastal natives did not begin in earnest until the late 19th century. During the early 19th century, native culture not only survived but flourished.|$|E
5|$|The ships {{would have}} been {{similarly}} equipped to the preceding Deutschland-class ships. The ships would have mounted six of the same /52 C/28 quick-firing guns in the same triple turret mounts. The guns had an actual bore diameter of , and fired both armor-piercing and high-explosive shells; both shells weighed 300kg (661.4lb). The guns used two sets of propellant charges: a 36.0kg (79.4lb) fore charge in a silk bag and a 71.0kg (156.6lb) main charge in a brass case. The shells were fired at 910meters per second (2,986fps), and at maximum elevation of 40degrees, a range of 36,475m (39,890yards). The guns had a rate of fire of 2.5 rounds per minute. However, eight guns were considered, <b>had</b> <b>there</b> <b>been</b> a quadruple turret available. The guns were supplied {{by a total of}} 900 shells, for a total of 150 rounds per gun.|$|E

No doubt in some one or two important respects, each one excelled the others. This was shown in those matters and things to which they gave their chief attention. Speaking of them and their families, so well represented here with us and elsewhere, {{it can be said that}} they have always stood for better things, not with assumption or pharisaically, but openly and firmly.

30|$|The GBI is {{a measure}} of chronic-intermittent forms of affective {{disorders}} and identifies the full range of severity of unipolar and BD—from sub-syndromal to syndromal (Depue et al. 1981, 1989). It consists of three clusters of items: depressive, hypomanic and biphasic (defined as the tendency to vacillate between depression and hypomania in the same item). The GBI has 73 items that are scored on a 0 – 4 Likert scale related to the chronicity of the symptom described. It is possible to use the scoring system of the GBI as a Likert scale yielding continuous scores of affective disturbance or dysregulation in the domains of depressive, hypomanic and biphasic symptoms. We used a selection of ten items from the depression domain of which the majority selected being consistent with a recent factor analysis informing the development of a shorter version of the GBI (Youngstrom et al. 2013). The items were: (1) Have you had periods of sadness and depression when almost everything gets on your nerves and makes you irritable or angry (other than related to the menstrual cycle)?; (2) <b>Have</b> <b>there</b> <b>been</b> times of several days or more when you were so sad that it was quite painful or you felt that you couldn’t stand it?; (3) <b>Have</b> <b>there</b> <b>been</b> times when you looked back over your life and could see only failures or hardships?; (4) <b>Have</b> <b>there</b> <b>been</b> times when you were feeling low and depressed, and you also had to struggle very hard to control inner feelings of rage or an urge to smash or destroy things?; (5) <b>Have</b> <b>there</b> <b>been</b> times when you exploded at others and afterwards felt bad about yourself?; (6) <b>Have</b> <b>there</b> <b>been</b> times when you hated yourself or felt that you were stupid, ugly, unlovable, or useless? (7) <b>Have</b> <b>there</b> <b>been</b> times of several days or more when you really got down on yourself and felt worthless?; (8) Have you had periods when it seemed that the future was hopeless and things could not improve?; (9) <b>Have</b> <b>there</b> <b>been</b> periods lasting several days or more when you were so down in the dumps that you thought you might never snap out of it?; and (10) <b>Have</b> <b>there</b> <b>been</b> times when you have felt that you would be better off dead? All 27 items for the hypomanic and biphasic domains were administered. The GBI has been extensively validated and possesses good psychometric properties (Depue et al. 1981, 1989).|$|R
