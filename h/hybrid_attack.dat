The Charged Laser special consists of the Ixion generating four energy spheres each firing powerful laser beams. A very important capability of the Ixion is that both its charged specials take a very short time to charge. The Ixion can participate in the <b>Hybrid</b> <b>Attack</b> with the seven standard aircraft and the Hell Diver. After the Slave and Judge Spear, the Ixion is the highest-tier plane in the game.|$|E

40|$|Emerging hybrid {{threats in}} {{large-scale}} warfare systems require networked teams {{to perform in}} a reliable manner under changing mission tactics and reconfiguration of mission tasks and force resources. In this paper, a formal Command and Control (C 2) structure is presented that allows for computer-aided execution of the networked team decision-making process, real-time tactic selection, and reliable mission reconfiguration. A mathematically justified networked computing environment is provided called the Augmented Discrete Event Control (ADEC) framework. ADEC is portable and {{has the ability to}} provide logical connectivity among all team participants including mission commander, field commanders, war-fighters, and robotic platforms. The proposed C 2 structure is developed and demonstrated on a simulation study involving Singapore Armed Forces team with three realistic symmetrical, asymmetrical, and <b>hybrid</b> <b>attack</b> missions.

40|$|Watermark {{attacks are}} first {{categorized}} and explained with examples in this paper. We then propose {{a new image}} watermark attack called "Pixel Reallocation Attack". The proposed attack is a hybrid approach, which aims to decorrelate the embedded watermark with the original watermark. Since many watermarking detections are by correlating the testing image with the target watermark, it will not work once we decorrelate the embedded watermark. For example, the geometrical transformation attacks desynchronize the correlation detector with the testing image leading to detection failure. However, by inserting a template or grid into the watermarked image can make inverse transformation possible and the watermark can be retrieved. If we apply transformations to every single pixel locally, independently and randomly, inverse transformation will not be possible and the attack will be successful since the embedded watermark is not correlated with the original watermark. Experiment shows that single technique approach needs a larger distortion to the image in order to attack the image successfully. We also tested our attack with commercial watermarking software. It cannot detect the watermark after we applied the proposed <b>hybrid</b> <b>attack</b> to the watermarked image...|$|E

The mitigation looked into Zeus, a common and the most frequently used attack toolkit to discover the hidden information used by the attackers to launch attacks.

Both the botmasters, his mules and buyers attempts to steal huge amount of money using the stolen credentials which includes both real and honeytokens and will be detected by an attack detector which sends an alert on any transaction involving the honeytokens. A reconfirmation process which is secured using enhanced RC 6 cryptosystem is enacted.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we extend the {{conditional}} correlation attack ([LCPP 96]) against the nonlinear filter generator (NLFG) by introducing new conditions and generalisations and present two known-plaintext <b>attacks,</b> called <b>hybrid</b> correlation <b>attack</b> and concentration attack. The NLFG {{is a well}} known LFSR-based keystream generator {{which could be used}} as a basic building block in a synchronous stream cipher system. Both new attacks use methods from the conditional correlation attack and additional from fast correlation attacks to derive the unknown initial state of the LFSR of the NLFG. The basic principle of iteratively cumulating and updating conditional correlations for the NLFG was proposed in [Löh 01] and for general combiners with memory in [GBM 02]. With the <b>hybrid</b> correlation <b>attack</b> it is possible to successfully attack the NLFG by applying a fast correlation attack, even if the filter function f of the NLFG is highly nonlinear, e. g. the normalised nonlinearity pe,f is ≥ 0. 45. The concentration attack maps all computed conditional correlations to D − B unknown LFSR bits, where D ≥ k and 1 ≤ B ≤ k are parameters which can be chosen by the attacker, and k is the length of the LFSR of the NLFG. Even with low values of conditional correlations, it is possible to mount the <b>hybrid</b> correlation <b>attack</b> and the concentration attack successfully. This is not the case for the originally version of the conditional correlation attack ([LCPP 96]) in a time lower than a full search over all possible initial states. Key words: stream ciphers, keystream generator, nonlinear filter generator, NLFG, conditional correlation attack, fast correlation attacks...|$|R

30|$|In [10], genetic {{algorithm}} optimization principles are employed {{and the strength}} of the watermark is controlled locally and according to the visual properties. The scheme is invisible to the human eyes and robust {{to a wide variety of}} common attacks. The disadvantage of this algorithm is that it is slow and not suited for real-time applications. A blind and highly robust watermarking scheme method for ownership verification and copyright protection has been presented in [11]. Watermarking is performed using principal component analysis (PCA) and Laplacian pyramid in contourlet transform. Wherever, it offers low payload. In [12], a novel blind watermarking algorithm is proposed. The algorithm is performed in DCT domain, using the correlation between two DCT coefficients of adjacent blocks in the same position. The watermarking algorithm is tested for some attacks, including JPEG compression, cropping, rotation, contrast enhancement, brightening, and sharpening. The disadvantage of this algorithm is that it is unable to embed a watermark bit in all the blocks, resulting in low capacity. In order to improve the payload capacity, all the blocks are used for the embedding purpose in [13]. The robustness of the proposed scheme has been examined for various singular and <b>hybrid</b> <b>attacks,</b> and a watermark of good quality is extracted even after various simultaneous attacks on the system.|$|R

Realising they may face another unwinnable battle, Kate Freelander is released. Though {{she tries to}} stay and fight, she is sent away as Magnus doesn't trust her. She would later stay and fight anyway. Magnus later visits Bigfoot, and leaves him a syringe of the Lazarus cure if he chooses to take it and save his friends. Henry maintains all the defence systems in the Sanctuary. However, the Cabal launch a virus to neutralise the EM shield, allowing the hybrids {{to break into the}} base with ease. Now with a fully functioning weapon, Magnus is able to kill three of the hybrids before she confronts Ashley, and attempts to talk her into coming back. After Bigfoot takes the cure and saves his friends, he protects Henry and Will while they restore the EM shield, which destroys the fourth hybrid when he attempts to teleport. Magnus faces off against Ashley and the final hybrid. The final <b>hybrid</b> <b>attacks</b> Magnus, but is stopped by Ashley, whose original personality (apparently buried, not destroyed) manages to regain control of her body temporarily.

40|$|Since several papers {{appeared}} in 2000, the {{quantum key distribution}} (QKD) community has been well aware that photon number splitting (PNS) attack by Eve severely limits the secure key distribution distance in BB 84 QKD systems with Poissonian photon sources. In attempts to solve this problem, entanglement-based QKD, single-photon based QKD, and entanglement swapping-based QKD, have been studied in recent years. However, there are many technological difficulties that must be overcome before these schemes can become practical systems. Here we report a very simple QKD system, in which secure keys were generated over > 100 km fibre for the first time. We used an alternative protocol of differential phase shift keying (DPSK) but with a Poissonian source. We analysed {{the security of the}} DPSK protocol and showed that it is robust even against <b>hybrid</b> <b>attacks</b> including collective PNS attack over consecutive pulses, intercept-and-resend (I-R) attack and beamsplitting (BS) attack, because of the non-deterministic collapse of a wavefunction in a quantum measurement. To implement this protocol, we developed a new detector for the 1. 5 um band based on frequency up-conversion in a periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide followed by a Si avalanche photodiode (APD). The use of the new detectors increased the sifted key generation rate up to > 1 Mbit/s over 30 km fibre, which is two orders of magnitude larger than the previous record.
