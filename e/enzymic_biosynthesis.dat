40|$|ArticleThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] cholinesterase levels of 10 male patients were determined before, during and after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. These levels dropped significantly below the pre-anaesthetic values after commencing anaesthesia. In 6 patients levels returned to pre-anaesthetic values before or on the 2 nd post-operative day. This could not be {{explained in terms of}} <b>enzymic</b> <b>biosynthesis</b> alone, and it is suggested that postoperative fluid readjustments may {{play an important role in}} certain cases.

40|$|T HE INSERTION OF IRON into {{protoporphyrin}} is {{the final}} step {{of a series of}} reactions in the biosynthesis of heme. ’ Several previous investigations have demonstrated that this step is enzyme-dependent and the enzyme has been named Theme synthetase ” or “iron chelatase. ” The enzyme has been extensively characterized in rat liver mitochondria, 2 and Porra and Jones suggested that two enzymes may be involved in the reaction. 3 The <b>enzymic</b> <b>biosynthesis</b> of heme from iron and protoporphyrin in erythroid tissue has mainly been described in avian erythrocyte lysates. 46 Langelaan, Losowsky and Toothill 7 have recently demonstrated heme synthetase activity and some properties of the enzyme in normal human peripheral blood. De-creased heme synthetase activity in peripheral blood has been reported in one patient with pyridoxine-responsive anemia 8 and also in several types of hema-tological disorders. 9 Lochhead and Goldberg’#{ 176 } measured heme synthetase in water lysates of human bone marrow and 5 teiner ’ ‘ has described low heme synthetase activity in water lysates of bone marrow from patients wit...|$|E
