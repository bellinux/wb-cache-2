50|$|Cardamine hirsuta, {{commonly}} called <b>hairy</b> <b>bittercress,</b> is an annual or biennial {{member of the}} mustard family (Brassicaceae), and is edible as a bitter herb. It is a common weed in moist areas and has been transported to many new regions by humans.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hairy</b> <b>bittercress</b> is {{very similar}} to Cardamine flexuosa. Some {{differences}} are that the stems are hairless and the leaves do not clasp the stems, as in C.flexuosa. It has only 4 stamens, C. flexuosa has 6 stamens, and the fruits overtop the flowers. In C. flexuos the fruits do not overtop the younger flowers. The fruits grow in a thin pod arranged as a single row.|$|E
50|$|Commonly {{found in}} damp, {{recently}} disturbed soil, open ground, turf and wasteplaces. Europe as far east as the Caucasus, and North Africa. These conditions are prevalent in nursery or garden centre plants, and <b>hairy</b> <b>bittercress</b> seeds may be introduced with those plants. Once established, particularly in lawn areas, {{it is difficult}} to eradicate. The tiny flowers are attractive to a few early butterflies, including (in the United States) spring azure (Celastrina ladon) and falcate orange-tip (Anthocharis midea).|$|E
50|$|Annual and {{biennial}} weeds such as chickweed, annual meadow grass, shepherd's purse, groundsel, fat hen, cleaver, speedwell and <b>hairy</b> <b>bittercress</b> propagate themselves by seeding. Many produce {{huge numbers of}} seed several times a season, some all year round. Groundsel can produce 1000 seed, and can continue right through a mild winter, whilst Scentless Mayweed produces over 30,000 seeds per plant. Not all of these will germinate at once, but over several seasons, lying dormant in the soil sometimes for years until exposed to light. Poppy seed can survive 80-100 years, dock 50 or more. There can be many thousands of seeds in a square foot or square metre of ground, thus and soil disturbance will produce a flush of fresh weed seedlings.|$|E
