40|$|The way we use {{computers}} and mobile phones today requires {{large amounts of}} processing of data streams. Examples include digital signal processing for wireless transmission, audio and video coding for recording and watching videos, and noise reduction <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>calls.</b> These tasks can be performed by stream programs—computer programs that process streams of data. Stream programs can be composed of other stream programs. Components of a composition are connected in a network, i. e. the output streams of one component are sent as input streams to other components. The components, that perform the actual computation, are called kernels. They {{can be described in}} different styles and programming languages. There are also formal models <b>for</b> describing <b>the</b> kernels and the networks. One such model is the actor machine. This dissertation evaluates the actor machine, how it facilitates creating efficient software implementation of stream programs. The evaluation is divided into four aspects: (1) analyzability of its structure, (2) generality in what languages and styles it can express, (3) efficient implementation of kernels, and (4) efficient implementation of networks. This dissertation demonstrates all four aspects through implementation and evaluation of a stream program compiler based on actor machines...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This study {{examines}} the effectiveness {{and costs of}} follow-up <b>phone</b> <b>calls</b> in improving response rates to a community survey. Methods: Non-responders to a postal survey were randomly allocated to receive a <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> or no <b>phone</b> <b>call.</b> <b>The</b> resources used <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{development and implementation of}} the survey were documented. The response rates and cost per level of follow-up contact examined. Results: Follow-up <b>phone</b> <b>calls</b> led to a statistical significant {{increase in the number of}} responses to a community-wide survey, relative to no <b>phone</b> <b>call.</b> This relative increase in responses (n= 62 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> follow-up <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> group versus n= 1 for controls), did not increase the absolute survey response rate sufficiently (from 38. 5 % for two mailed surveys to 39. 8 % for two mailed surveys plus a <b>phone</b> <b>call)</b> to justify <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> costs. Scenario analyses show increasing the initial response rate by 10 % and conducting a second mailed survey achieves greater marginal cost savings than increasing the response rate to the second mailout or <b>the</b> follow-up <b>phone</b> <b>calls.</b> Conclusions: These results suggest a follow-up <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> was not cost effective. Survey research ought to primarily focus on obtaining optimal initial response rates by using strategies identified in a Cochrane meta-analytic review...|$|R
