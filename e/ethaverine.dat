40|$|Papaverine and its analogues {{have been}} {{advocated}} {{by a number}} of authors for the treatment of angina pectoris, and this study describes an attempt to evaluate the ethyl analogue of papaverine, <b>ethaverine</b> (diquinol) for this purpose. The relationship of <b>ethaverine</b> to papaverine and dioxyline phosphate (pavaril) is shown below...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ethaverine</b> is a {{derivative}} of papaverine {{used in the}} treatment of peripheral vascular disease and is thought to cause vasodilation by reducing intracellular Ca 2 concentrations in vascular smooth muscle cells. We tested its effects on single, dihydropyridine-sensitive, L-type calcium channels from porcine cardiac muscle, incorporated into planar lipid bilayers. L-type calcium channels were activated by step depolarizations from a holding potential of- 60 mV to a test potential of 0 mV, and unitary currents carried by 1 00 mM BaCl 2 were recorded. Channel activity was enhanced by the presence of the dihydropyridine agonist (+) - 202 - 791 (0. 5 zM) and the activated a subunit of the stimulatory GTP-binding protein, G. We found that 0. 3 - 30 M <b>ethaverine</b> {{on either side of the}} channel caused a reduction in the channel open probability (EC 1 zM), with the higher concentrations inhibiting channel activity almost completely. In addition, th...|$|E
40|$|Potentiometric and amperometric thick-film chemo- and biosensors {{as well as}} thick-film {{multichannel}} biosensors for simultaneous amperometric and potentiometric measurements {{have been}} developed which are especially suited for clinical use. Research and development resulted in new transducers and membrane materials and in sensors for detection of the following components: muscle-relaxants (pancuronium, tubocurarine, gallamine, succinylcholine), indomethacines, <b>ethaverine,</b> papaverine, pyrantel, bretylium (antiarrhythmic drug), tumour marker bound sialic acid, acetylcholine, chlortetracycline, urea, penicillin-G, glucose and sucrose.
