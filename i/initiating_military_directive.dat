40|$|ABSTRACT: Why do states {{choose to}} <b>initiate</b> <b>military</b> occupations? To answer this question, I develop a {{credible}} commitment argument that suggests {{states will have}} difficulties creating ex ante agreements because future shifts {{in the distribution of}} military power will would provide a state incentives to renege on their bargains. If states cannot credibly commitment, then the stronger state has an incentive to lock-in their expected future benefits by <b>initiating</b> a <b>military</b> occupation within the weaker state...|$|R
