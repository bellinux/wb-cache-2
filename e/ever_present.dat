5|$|Stanley {{never saw}} a Stanley Cup {{championship}} game, nor did he <b>ever</b> <b>present</b> the Cup. Although his term as Governor General ended in September 1893, {{he was forced to}} return to England on July 15. In April of that year, his elder brother Edward Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby died, and Stanley succeeded him as the 16th Earl of Derby.|$|E
5|$|In {{the distant}} future, {{thousands}} of years after a great war between humans and their biologically engineered weapons, humans live in everything from small tribes to large nations. One nation, the Empire, has discovered a black tower {{in the middle of}} a lake near their capital, which gave them access to large amounts of ancient weapons which they used to beat back and control the <b>ever</b> <b>present</b> monsters in the world. The Imperials were corrupted by this power and became conquerors of others as opposed to liberators from a violent world.|$|E
5|$|Kiplagat, who was <b>ever</b> <b>present</b> at {{the front}} of the women's race, outdid Ethiopian Dire Tune in the last {{kilometre}} to win her second gold medal on the global stage. Mirroring Kitwara, Kenya's women's bronze medallist Peninah Jerop Arusei secured the team's victory over Ethiopia. Representing the hosts, Zhu Xiaolin was the only non-African to reach the top eight at the championships. The joint effort of the Japanese women aided them to a sixth consecutive team bronze medal – making them the only medalling country outside the typically strong African triumvirate of Kenya, Ethiopia and Eritrea.|$|E

5|$|The {{front part}} of a skull (specimen NMP P6V-004389, a syntype of this species) in the National Museum of Prague was found in 1850 among {{the remains of the}} Böhmisches Museum. Other {{elements}} supposedly belonging to this specimen have been listed in the literature, but it appears only the partial skull was <b>ever</b> <b>present.</b> It may be what remains of one of the stuffed dodos known to have been at the menagerie of Emperor Rudolph II, possibly the specimen painted by Hoefnagel or Savery there.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the first}} ten years of the society's existence, the {{organization}} grew in membership and held meetings {{at least twice a}} month, and usually four times a month. The society debated an extensive range of subjects including scientific, religious, political, and social topics, often violating the constitution's rules banning religious and political subjects. The society's debates were often acrimonious and regularly spilled beyond the confines of the meetings and into the community. Between January 30, 1819 and January 22, 1830, the society's membership rolls reached 52 members; although as few as 15 members attended the bimonthly meetings, and no more than 17 members were <b>ever</b> <b>present</b> at a meeting.|$|E

The other notable record Finnan established with Notts County during this season was a streak of 10 consecutive victories; a club record and one which still stands today.|$|E
25|$|Māori is <b>ever</b> <b>present</b> {{and has a}} {{significant}} conceptual influence in the legislature, government, and community agencies (e.g. health and education), where legislation requires that proceedings and documents be translated into Māori (under certain circumstances, and when requested). Political discussion and analysis of issues of sovereignty, environmental management, health, and social well-being thus rely on Māori at least in part. Māori as a spoken language is particularly important wherever community consultation occurs.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand toured England in 1958, {{the hosts}} won the five Test series 4–0, {{with three of}} those {{victories}} by an innings. Evans was once again an <b>ever</b> <b>present</b> in the team but his batting was poor with 28 runs at an average 5.60. Nevertheless he did break one record in the series, by playing the fifth Test at The Oval he made his 86th Test appearance passing the previous record held by Wally Hammond.|$|E

25|$|Australia toured in 1956 and Evans was an <b>ever</b> <b>present</b> in the England side {{who won the}} Test series 2–1. Evans scored 115 runs at 19.16, {{three of}} his seven innings were ducks. His highest score came in the fourth Test at Old Trafford where he scored 47 in 29 minutes with five fours and two sixes. England won the match, and {{retained}} the Ashes, after Jim Laker's unprecedented 19 wickets. Evans took nine dismissals in the series but seven of these came in one match – the second Test.|$|E
25|$|War with France and {{population}} growth made famine an <b>ever</b> <b>present</b> danger {{in the early nineteenth}} century and there was an urgent need to maximise food production using any land that could be cultivated. In the 1820s, emigration, mostly to Canada, was promoted as a means of relieving rural unemployment and poverty. Thomas Sockett, Rector of Petworth and Wyndham's protégé, promoted the Petworth Emigration Scheme, which sent 1,800 people from Sussex and neighbouring counties to Upper Canada between 1832 and 1837. The earl encouraged those living on his land to join the scheme by offering to pay the £10 per head cost of passage.|$|E
25|$|Gibson made a {{promising}} beginning in first-class cricket in 1957, taking ten wickets in the match against Gloucestershire, in only his second appearance {{for the first}} team and on his debut in the County Championship. Taking ten wickets in a match was a feat {{that he would never}} repeat. In spite of this early success, with Alec Bedser and Peter Loader almost <b>ever</b> <b>present</b> as the opening bowlers, he made only one further appearance that season. However he could reflect that he had been a part, if a minor one, of the Surrey side that had won the Championship for an unprecedented sixth season in succession. In his three matches he had taken 17 wickets at an average of 15.58.|$|E
