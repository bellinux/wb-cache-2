5|$|The European Space Agency {{selected}} the L1-class JUICE mission in 2012 {{as part of}} its Cosmic Vision programme to explore three of Jupiter's Galilean moons, with a possible Ganymede lander provided by Roscosmos. JUICE is proposed to be launched in 2022. ISRO will launch the first Indian mission to Jupiter in 2022 or 2023 through <b>Geosynchronous</b> Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III.|$|E
5|$|More unorthodox {{methods were}} also explored. Astrosystems International {{developed}} a so-called “Quartz Chamber” which burned pure oxygen and aircraft fuel, converting the chemical energy into light. The system was {{planned to be}} evaluated within a year, and installed in a similar arrangement to the more conventional BIAS. A plan, codenamed Moonshine, was also put forward. Moonshine {{was to be a}} joint effort with NASA to determine the feasibility of a <b>geosynchronous</b> satellite that could in project light directly down on any desired location.|$|E
5|$|O'Neill founded Geostar Corporation {{to develop}} a {{satellite}} position determination system {{for which he was}} granted a patent in 1982. The system, primarily intended to track aircraft, was called Radio Determination Satellite Service (RDSS). In April 1983 Geostar applied to the FCC for a license to broadcast from three satellites, which would cover the entire United States. Geostar launched GSTAR-2 into <b>geosynchronous</b> orbit in 1986. Its transmitter package permanently failed two months later, so Geostar began tests of RDSS by transmitting from other satellites. With his health failing, O'Neill became less involved with the company {{at the same time it}} started to run into trouble. In February 1991 Geostar filed for bankruptcy and its licenses were sold to Motorola for the Iridium satellite constellation project. Although the system was eventually replaced by GPS, O'Neill made significant advances in the field of position determination.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{element of}} the STS-8 mission payload was INSAT-1B. It was the second {{in a series of}} {{multi-purpose}} weather and communications satellites to be operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); the first, INSAT-1A, had been launched by a Delta rocket in April 1982, but had to be shut down shortly afterwards due to a failure of the onboard reaction control system. The satellite was carried {{in the rear of the}} shuttle's payload bay, and was boosted into a <b>geosynchronous</b> transfer orbit by a Payload Assist Module (PAM-D), a small solid rocket upper stage, after its release from the orbiter. The satellite, with its upper stage, massed a total of , with the cradle massing another , and had cost around $50 million.|$|E

25|$|In July 1998, amateur {{observers}} in Texas observed an unidentified object flashing in <b>geosynchronous</b> orbit. The object was subsequently lost, however it was rediscovered in June 2000 when its flashes became brighter; some even visible {{with the naked}} eye. Following the 2000 observations amateur observers were still unable to identify the satellite, so began referring to it by the pseudo International Designator 2000-653A and pseudo Satellite Catalog Number 90007.|$|E

25|$|In January 2010, amateur {{observer}} Ted Molczan cross-referenced {{data from}} the European Space Agency's Classification of <b>Geosynchronous</b> Objects survey with amateur observations of classified spacecraft, noting that an unidentified object designated UI.139 by the survey corresponded with observations of 2000-653A, and that its orbit was close to that of USA-67 - speculating {{that they may have}} been from the same launch. Based on this, Molczan conducted a more detailed investigation, and in 2011 published a paper identifying 2000-653A as Prowler.|$|E
