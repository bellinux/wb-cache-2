5|$|The {{design of}} the command {{sequence}} to be relayed to the spacecraft and the calculations for each photograph's <b>exposure</b> <b>time</b> were developed by space scientists Candy Hansen of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Carolyn Porco of the University of Arizona. After the planned imaging sequence was taken on February 14, 1990, {{the data from the}} camera was stored initially in an on-board tape recorder. Transmission to Earth was also delayed by the Magellan and Galileo missions being given priority over the use of the Deep Space Network. Then, between March and May 1990, Voyager 1 returned 60 frames back to Earth, with the radio signal travelling {{at the speed of light}} for nearly five and a half hours to cover the distance.|$|E

His daguerreotype of Ulfeldts Plads is in the Copenhagen City Museum.

5|$|Central {{nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} manifests as {{symptoms such as}} visual changes (especially tunnel vision), ringing in the ears (tinnitus), nausea, twitching (especially of the face), behavioural changes (irritability, anxiety, confusion), and dizziness. This may {{be followed by a}} tonic–clonic seizure consisting of two phases: intense muscle contraction occurs for several seconds (tonic phase); followed by rapid spasms of alternate muscle relaxation and contraction producing convulsive jerking (clonic phase). The seizure ends with a period of unconsciousness (the postictal state). The onset of seizure depends upon the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas and exposure duration. However, <b>exposure</b> <b>time</b> before onset is unpredictable, as tests have shown a wide variation, both amongst individuals, and in the same individual from day to day. In addition, many external factors, such as underwater immersion, exposure to cold, and exercise will decrease the time to onset of central nervous system symptoms. Decrease of tolerance is closely linked to retention of carbon dioxide. Other factors, such as darkness and caffeine, increase tolerance in test animals, but these effects have not been proven in humans.|$|E
25|$|To {{accurately}} {{predict what}} UV dose {{will be delivered}} to the target the UV intensity, adjusted for distance, coating and end of lamp life, will be multiplied by the <b>exposure</b> <b>time.</b> In static applications the <b>exposure</b> <b>time</b> can be as long as needed for an effective UV dose to be reached. In case of rapidly moving air, in AC air ducts for example, the <b>exposure</b> <b>time</b> is short so the UV intensity must be increased by introducing multiple UV lamps or even banks of lamps.

25|$|There are {{trade-offs}} between increasing {{either the}} temperature or <b>exposure</b> <b>time.</b> Generally where the molecular breakdown temperature is higher, the <b>exposure</b> <b>time</b> for heating can be shorter, but excessively high temperatures {{can also cause}} wear and damage {{to other parts of}} the incineration equipment. Likewise the breakdown temperature can be lowered to some degree but then the exhaust gases would require a greater lingering period of perhaps several minutes, which would require large/long treatment chambers that take up a great deal of treatment plant space.|$|E
25|$|The risk {{of hearing}} damage {{also depends on}} the <b>exposure</b> <b>time.</b> The higher the volume, the faster hearing loss occurs.

An {{increase}} to just 95dBA cuts the safe exposure to only 4 hours. But {{there seems to be}} no specific consensus on the level of exposure. NIOSH has an 8-hour recommended exposure limit set to 85dBA. Additionally, an increase to 93dBA instead of 95dBA halves the safe <b>exposure</b> <b>time</b> to 4 hours.|$|E

25|$|Formaldehyde {{preserves}} or fixes tissue or cells by {{a mixture}} of reversible (short <b>exposure</b> <b>time</b> and low temperatures) and irreversible (long <b>exposure</b> <b>time</b> and higher temperatures) cross-linking of primary amino groups in proteins with other nearby nitrogen atoms in protein or DNA through a -CH2- linkage. This is exploited in ChIP-on-chip or ChIP-sequencing genomics experiments, where DNA-binding proteins are cross-linked to their cognate binding sites on the chromosome and analyzed to determine what genes are regulated by the proteins. Formaldehyde is also used as a denaturing agent in RNA gel electrophoresis, preventing RNA from forming secondary structures. A solution of 4% formaldehyde fixes pathology tissue specimens at about one mm per hour at room temperature.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{impedance}} spectra {{obtained at}} short <b>exposure</b> <b>times</b> for A 1 7075 -T 6 immersed in 0. 5 N NaC 1 {{do not agree}} with the pitting model proposed by Mansfeld and co-workers. Instead of a transmission line impedance, an inductive loop is observed at low frequencies. This result is due to the non-linearity of the system at short <b>exposure</b> <b>times,</b> when Ecorr is close to Epi t. The application of the anodic portion of the ac signal causes this non-linear behavior. The observed impedance is therefore a system response and not a true impedance. For longer <b>exposure</b> <b>times</b> agreement with the pitting model is observed...|$|R
