5|$|An {{incidental}} finding {{associated with}} this condition is a heel spur, a small bony calcification on the calcaneus (heel bone), {{which can be found}} in up to 50% of those with plantar <b>fasciitis.</b> In such cases, it is the underlying plantar <b>fasciitis</b> that produces the heel pain, and not the spur itself. The condition is responsible for the creation of the spur though the clinical significance of heel spurs in plantar <b>fasciitis</b> remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|Identified {{risk factors}} for plantar <b>fasciitis</b> include {{excessive}} running, standing on hard surfaces for prolonged periods of time, high arches of the feet, {{the presence of a}} leg length inequality, and flat feet. The tendency of flat feet to excessively roll inward during walking or running makes them more susceptible to plantar <b>fasciitis.</b> Obesity is seen in 70% of individuals who present with plantar <b>fasciitis</b> and is an independent risk factor.|$|E
5|$|Originally, plantar <b>fasciitis</b> was {{believed}} to be an inflammatory condition of the plantar fascia. However, within the last decade, studies have observed microscopic anatomical changes indicating that plantar <b>fasciitis</b> is actually due to a noninflammatory structural breakdown of the plantar fascia rather than an inflammatory process.|$|E
5|$|A {{determination}} about {{a diagnosis}} of plantar <b>fasciitis</b> can usually be made based on a person's medical history and physical examination.|$|E
5|$|Disruptions in the plantar fascia's normal {{mechanical}} movement during standing and walking (known as the Windlass mechanism) {{are thought to}} {{contribute to the development of}} plantar <b>fasciitis</b> by placing excess strain on the calcaneal tuberosity. Other studies have also suggested that plantar <b>fasciitis</b> is not actually due to inflamed plantar fascia, but may be a tendon injury involving the flexor digitorum brevis muscle located immediately deep to the plantar fascia.|$|E
5|$|Studies have {{suggested}} a strong association exists between an increased {{body mass index}} {{and the development of}} plantar <b>fasciitis</b> in the non-athletic population; this association between weight and plantar <b>fasciitis</b> has not been observed in the athletic population. Achilles tendon tightness and inappropriate footwear have also been identified as significant risk factors.|$|E
5|$|In early 2011, Hanneman {{contracted}} necrotizing <b>fasciitis.</b> Reports linked this illness with {{a spider}} bite {{he claimed to}} have received while in a friend's hot tub.|$|E
5|$|Plantar <b>fasciitis</b> {{is usually}} {{diagnosed}} by {{a health care}} provider after consideration of a person's presenting history, risk factors, and clinical examination. Tenderness to palpation along the inner aspect of the heel bone on the {{sole of the foot}} may be elicited during the physical examination. The foot may have limited dorsiflexion due to tightness of the calf muscles or the Achilles tendon. Dorsiflexion of the foot may elicit the pain due to stretching of the plantar fascia with this motion. Diagnostic imaging studies are not usually needed to diagnose plantar <b>fasciitis.</b> However, in certain cases a physician may decide imaging studies (such as X-rays, diagnostic ultrasound or MRI) are warranted to rule out serious causes of foot pain.|$|E
5|$|Between 4% and 7% {{of people}} have heel pain {{at any given time}} and about 80% of these cases are due to plantar <b>fasciitis.</b> Approximately 10% {{of people have}} the {{disorder}} at some point during their life. It becomes more common with age. It is unclear if one sex is more affected than the other.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{this shift}} in thought about the {{underlying}} mechanisms in plantar <b>fasciitis,</b> many in the academic community have stated the condition should be renamed plantar fasciosis. The structural breakdown of the plantar fascia {{is believed to be}} the result of repetitive microtrauma (small tears). Microscopic examination of the plantar fascia often shows myxomatous degeneration, connective tissue calcium deposits, and disorganized collagen fibers.|$|E
5|$|If the plantar fascia {{continues}} to be overused {{in the setting of}} plantar <b>fasciitis,</b> the plantar fascia can rupture. Typical signs and symptoms of plantar fascia rupture include a clicking or snapping sound, significant local swelling, and acute pain in the sole of the foot.|$|E
5|$|Medical imaging is not {{routinely}} {{needed as}} it is expensive and does not typically change how plantar <b>fasciitis</b> is managed. When the diagnosis is not clinically apparent, lateral view x-rays of the ankle are the recommended imaging modality to assess for other causes of heel pain such as stress fractures or bone spur development.|$|E
5|$|Most {{cases of}} plantar <b>fasciitis</b> resolve {{with time and}} {{conservative}} methods of treatment. Usually {{for the first few}} weeks people are advised to rest, change their activities, take pain medications, and stretch. If this is not sufficient physiotherapy, orthotics, splinting, or steroid injections may be options. If other measures do not work extracorporeal shockwave therapy or surgery may be tried.|$|E
5|$|The {{causes of}} plantar <b>fasciitis</b> {{are not entirely}} clear. Risk factors include overuse such as from long periods of standing, an {{increase}} in exercise, and obesity. It is also associated with inward rolling of the foot and a lifestyle that involves little exercise. While heel spurs are frequently found it is unclear {{if they have a}} role in causing the condition. Plantar <b>fasciitis</b> is a disorder of the insertion site of the ligament on the bone characterized by micro tears, breakdown of collagen, and scarring. As inflammation plays a lesser role, many feel the condition should be renamed plantar fasciosis. The diagnosis is typically based on signs and symptoms with ultrasound sometimes used to help. Other conditions with similar symptoms include osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, heel pad syndrome, and reactive arthritis.|$|E
5|$|Parizeau's stance created {{opposition}} in the sovereignty movement, which coalesced around Bloc Québécois leader Lucien Bouchard. A popular and charismatic figure, Bouchard had come close to death from necrotizing <b>fasciitis</b> and lost his left leg. His recovery, and subsequent public appearances on crutches, provided a rallying point for sovereigntists and the public at large. Bouchard thought a proposal lacking a partnership would doom the project among soft nationalists (such as himself) who worried about the economic consequences of separation.|$|E
5|$|Plantar <b>fasciitis</b> is a {{disorder}} {{that results in}} pain in the heel {{and bottom of the}} foot. The pain is usually most severe with the first steps of the day or following a period of rest. Pain is also frequently brought on by bending the foot and toes up towards the shin and may be worsened by a tight Achilles tendon. The condition typically comes on slowly. In about a third of people both legs are affected.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} plantar <b>fasciitis</b> is poorly {{understood}} and {{is thought to}} likely have several contributing factors. The plantar fascia is a thick fibrous band of connective tissue that originates from the medial tubercle and anterior aspect of the heel bone. From there, the fascia extends along the {{sole of the foot}} before inserting {{at the base of the}} toes, and supports the arch of the foot.|$|E
5|$|Normally the plantar fascia {{has three}} {{fascicle}}s {{with the central}} fascicle thickest at 4mm, the lateral fascicle at 2mm and the medial at less than a millimeter in thickness. In theory, the likeliness of <b>fasciitis</b> increases with increasing thickness of plantar fascia at the calcaneal insertion, with thickness of more than 4.5mm being somewhat useful on ultrasound and 4mm on MRI. Findings on imaging such as plantar aponeurosis thickening, however, may be absent in symptomatic individuals or present in asymptomatic individuals thereby limiting the utility of such observations.|$|E
5|$|Other diagnoses {{that are}} {{typically}} considered include fractures, tumors, or systemic disease if plantar <b>fasciitis</b> pain fails to respond appropriately to conservative medical treatments. Bilateral heel pain or heel {{pain in the}} context of a systemic illness may indicate a need for a more in-depth diagnostic investigation. Under these circumstances, diagnostic tests such as a CBC or serological markers of inflammation, infection, or autoimmune disease such as C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anti-nuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, HLA-B27, uric acid, or Lyme disease antibodies may also be obtained. Neurological deficits may prompt an investigation with electromyography to evaluate for damage to the nerves or muscles.|$|E
5|$|During the 2005–06 season, Duncan {{suffered}} from plantar <b>fasciitis</b> {{for most of}} the season, which was at least partly responsible for his sinking output (18.6 points, 11.0 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 2.0 blocks per game), and also for his failure to make the All-NBA First Team after eight consecutive appearances. The big man came back strong in the 2006 NBA Playoffs against the Dallas Mavericks, where he outscored rival power forward Dirk Nowitzki 32.2 to 27.1 points, with neither Nowitzki nor Mavericks center Erick Dampier able to stop Duncan with their man-to-man defense. But after splitting the first six games, Duncan became the tragic hero of his team in Game 7. Despite scoring 39 points in regulation time and fouling out both Dampier and Keith Van Horn, Duncan only made one of seven field goal attempts in overtime against Mavericks reserve center DeSagana Diop, and the Spurs lost Game 7.|$|E
25|$|Mucormycosis, a rare fungal {{infection}} that can present like necrotizing <b>fasciitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Treatment for necrotizing <b>fasciitis</b> {{may involve}} an {{interdisciplinary}} care team. For example, {{in the case}} of a necrotizing <b>fasciitis</b> involving the head and neck, the team could include otolaryngologists, speech pathologists, intensivists, infectious disease specialists, and plastic surgeons or oral and maxillofacial surgeons. Maintaining strict asepsis during any surgical procedure and regional anaesthesia techniques is vital in preventing the occurrence of the disease.|$|E
25|$|It is {{injected}} into the heel when treating plantar <b>fasciitis,</b> sometimes in conjunction with triamcinolone acetonide.|$|E
25|$|A 68-year-old {{man died}} from septicemia and necrotizing <b>fasciitis</b> after a wound was licked by his dog.|$|E
25|$|Other {{conditions}} {{that can result}} in symptoms similar to the blistering form include other bullous skin diseases, burns, and necrotizing <b>fasciitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Common organisms include Group AStreptococcus(group A strep),Klebsiella,Clostridium,Escherichia coli,Staphylococcus aureus,andAeromonas hydrophila, and others. Group A strep is {{considered}} {{the most common cause}} of necrotizing <b>fasciitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|As per the {{derivation}} {{study of}} the LRINEC score, a score of ≥6 is a reasonable cut-off to rule in necrotizing <b>fasciitis,</b> but a LRINEC <6 does not completely rule out the diagnosis. Diagnoses of severe cellulitis or abscess should also be considered due to similar presentations. 10% of patients with necrotizing <b>fasciitis</b> in the original study still had a LRINEC score <6. But a validation study showed that patients with a LRINEC score ≥6 have {{a higher rate of}} both mortality and amputation.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, {{during his}} second cabinet, Balkenende was {{diagnosed}} with necrotizing <b>fasciitis.</b> He was treated through surgical debridement and made a full recovery after several weeks in hospital.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, a {{woman from}} County Durham had her left index finger amputated after {{contracting}} the flesh-eating bug necrotising <b>fasciitis</b> following a claimed bite from a false widow spider.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, a woman {{died from}} flesh-eating {{bacteria}} (Necrotizing <b>fasciitis)</b> that she contracted from the St. Johns River. Two or three cases are typically {{reported in the}} county each year.|$|E
25|$|Other {{conditions}} {{that can cause}} similar symptoms include: cellulitis, a sebaceous cyst and necrotising <b>fasciitis.</b> Cellulitis typically also has an erythematous reaction, but does not confer any purulent drainage.|$|E
25|$|Necrotizing <b>fasciitis</b> affects about 0.4 {{in every}} 100,000 people {{per year in}} the United States. In some areas of the world it is as common as 1 in every 100,000 people.|$|E
25|$|Patients with {{septic shock}} {{are treated with}} {{antimicrobial}} drugs to treat the causative infection. Some sources of infection require surgical intervention including necrotizing <b>fasciitis,</b> cholangitis, abscess, intestinal ischemia, or infected medical devices.|$|E
25|$|Patient {{can have}} {{enthesitis}} presenting as heel pain, Achilles tendinitis or plantar <b>fasciitis,</b> along with balanitis circinata (circinate balanitis), which involves penile lesions present in roughly 20 to 40 {{percent of the}} men with the disease.|$|E
25|$|Toxic shock {{syndrome}} (TSS) {{is a condition}} caused by bacterial toxins. Symptoms may include fever, rash, skin peeling, and low blood pressure. There may also be symptoms related to the specific underlying infection such as mastitis, osteomyelitis, necrotising <b>fasciitis,</b> or pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|In necrotizing <b>fasciitis,</b> {{aggressive}} surgical debridement (removal {{of infected}} tissue) is always {{necessary to keep}} it from spreading and is the only treatment available. Diagnosis is confirmed by visual examination of the tissues and by tissue samples sent for microscopic evaluation.|$|E
