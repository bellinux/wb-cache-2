5|$|During the American Civil War (18611865), cavalry {{held the}} most {{important}} and respected role it would ever hold in the American military. Field artillery in the American Civil War was also highly mobile. Both horses and mules pulled the guns, though only horses were used on the battlefield. At the beginning of the war, most of the experienced cavalry officers were from the South and thus joined the Confederacy, leading to the Confederate Army's initial battlefield superiority. The tide turned at the 1863 Battle of Brandy Station, part of the Gettysburg campaign, where the Union cavalry, in the largest cavalry battle ever fought on the American continent, ended the dominance of the South. By 1865, Union cavalry were decisive in achieving victory. So important were horses to individual soldiers that the surrender terms at Appomattox allowed every Confederate cavalryman to take his horse <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> This was because, unlike their Union counterparts, Confederate cavalrymen provided their own horses for service instead of drawing them from the government.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Buzz and {{the other}} toys reach Al's Toy Barn. While searching for Woody, Buzz is imprisoned by a new Buzz Lightyear toy, who {{believes}} Buzz is a rogue space ranger. The new Buzz joins the other toys, who mistake him for Andy's Buzz. After revealing Al's plan, they go to his apartment, while Andy's Buzz escapes and pursues them, accidentally freeing an Emperor Zurg toy, who in turn follows him {{with the intent of}} destroying him. After the toys find Woody, Buzz rejoins them, and proves that he is Andy's Buzz, but Woody refuses to go home. Buzz reminds Woody that a toy's true purpose is to be played with, which he would never experience in a museum. After seeing a boy play with him on TV, Woody realizes Buzz was right, and asks the Roundup gang to come <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> and Andy's toys. However, Stinky Pete declines, and traps the gang, revealing that he wants to go to the museum to be appreciated forever, having never been sold or played with. He was also the one responsible for foiling Woody's earlier escape attempt and framing Jessie for it. Al then returns, takes the gang in a suitcase, and leaves for the airport.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} {{arrived at}} its final destination of Libreville on 21 March, after twenty-seven days. The {{block of ice}} was found to weigh 2,714kg; it had lost only 336kg along the way. Though it was unclear how much time the expedition would take, Klevan had initially estimated a loss of 10%; the end result was approximately 11%. A French representative of the company met the crew in Libreville. A personal friend of President Charles de Gaulle, he presented an offer to drive the ice back to Paris. If the crew accepted, the President himself would have received the crew under the Arc de Triomphe. The men, however, were too exhausted at that point to contemplate such an offer. Instead, arrangement were made for the vehicles to be brought back by freight, while the crew would fly home. The ice was cut up and divided between the citizens of Libreville, for whom this was a rare commodity. Klevan, always conscious of promotional opportunities, brought {{a portion of the}} ice back <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> This ice was subsequently used in drinks served to journalists at the première of the expedition documentary back home in Oslo.|$|E
