25|$|The PCB {{expressed}} regret over India's {{decision not}} to participate in the championship. The PCB chairman, Lt. Gen. Tauqir Zia was dismayed over the Indian government's decision to go back on their commitment, which was a guarantee that India would <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>objection</b> playing multilateral tournaments which included Pakistan.|$|E
500|$|In 1974, the Government Information Office banned A Dictionary of Southern Min, with a {{government}} official saying: [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>objection</b> to the dictionary being used by foreigners. They could use it in mimeographed form. But we don't want it published as a book and sold publicly because of the Romanization it contains. Chinese should not be learning Chinese through Romanization." [...] Also in the 1970s, a POJ New Testament translation known as the [...] "Red Cover Bible" [...] (Âng-phoê Sèng-keng) was confiscated and banned by the Nationalist regime. Official moves against native languages continued into the 1980s, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of the Interior decided in 1984 to forbid missionaries to use [...] "local dialects" [...] and romanizations in their work.|$|E
500|$|In February 1792, Breckinridge, a Democratic-Republican, {{was elected}} to the U.S. House of Representatives over token opposition. On the date of the election, he wrote to Archibald Stuart, [...] "The People {{appearing}} willing to elect, I could <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>objection</b> to serve them one Winter in Congress." [...] Despite this, he left for Kentucky in March 1793 and resigned without serving a day in Congress, which convened on March 4. He chose the longer but safer route to Kentucky, joining a group of flatboats at Brownsville, Pennsylvania, for the trip down the Monongahela and Ohio rivers to Limestone (now Maysville, Kentucky). His family, along with 25 slaves, arrived in April and established their plantation, Cabell's Dale. By the time of Breckinridge's move, he owned [...] in Kentucky.|$|E

500|$|It emerged {{very quickly}} {{during the trial}} that Raith had no {{particular}} knowledge of {{the workings of the}} board. A series of administrators came forward to say that Barnes had reportedly misbehaved on the 1948 tour, even though Johnson's official report as manager had made no mention of any disharmony. Aubrey Oxlade, {{the chairman of the board}} and one of the four board members who voted to ratify Barnes's selection, said that the batsman's indiscretions were [...] "childish things" [...] and [...] "not serious at all". Later, Frank Cush, another board member who had supported Barnes's inclusion, replied [...] "none at all" [...] when asked if there were any legitimate reasons for excluding Barnes. Selector Chappie Dwyer said [...] "I have a very high opinion of him as a cricketer... and I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>objection</b> to him as a man".|$|E
500|$|Keith Johnson, {{the team}} manager during the 1948 tour, became {{the centre of}} attention. He wrote and had always claimed that the touring party had been {{completely}} harmonious and loyal. A series of administrators came forward to say that Barnes had misbehaved on the 1948 tour, even though Johnson's official report had {{made no mention of}} any problems. There were also positive reports. Aubrey Oxlade, the chairman of the board, said that the batsman's indiscretions were [...] "childish things" [...] and [...] "not serious at all". Frank Cush, another board member who had supported Barnes's inclusion, replied [...] "none at all" [...] when asked if there were any legitimate reasons for excluding Barnes.

500|$|When {{the former}} Drummond G14 and P14 4-6-0s were rebuilt to Maunsell’s N15 {{specification}} in February 1925, the Southern Railway {{decided to give}} names to all express passenger locomotives. Because of the railway's association with the West of England, the Public Relations Officer, John Elliot suggested {{that members of the}} N15class should be named after characters and places associated with the legend of King Arthur. When Maunsell was told of the decision to name the locomotives, he replied: [...] "Tell Sir Herbert [...] I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>objection,</b> but I warn you, it won't make any difference to the working of the engines". Walker was the General Manager of the Southern Railway, who had told Elliot that Maunsell's permission was required. The first G14 to be rebuilt, No.E453, was given the first name and christened King Arthur. The Urie locomotives (hitherto referred as N15s rather than King Arthurs) were also given names connected with Arthurian legend and were referred to as [...] "Urie Arthurs"; the Maunsell batches of N15s were nicknamed the [...] "Eastleigh" [...] and [...] "Scotch Arthurs".|$|E

500|$|The same year, Holmes was {{approached}} by Martin Delany, an African-American man {{who had worked with}} Frederick Douglass. The 38-year-old requested admission to Harvard after having been previously rejected by four schools despite impressive credentials. In a controversial move, Holmes admitted Delany and two other black men to the Medical School. Their admission sparked a student statement, which read: [...] "Resolved That we <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>objection</b> to the education and evaluation of blacks but do decidedly remonstrate against their presence in College with us." [...] Sixty students signed the resolution, although 48 students signed another resolution which noted it would be [...] "a far greater evil, if, in the present state of public feeling, a medical college in Boston could refuse to this unfortunate class any privileges of education, which it is {{in the power of the}} profession to bestow". In response, Holmes told the black students they would not be able to continue after that semester. A faculty meeting directed Holmes to write that [...] "the intermixing of races is distasteful to a large portion of the class, & injurious to the interests of the school". Despite his support of education for blacks, he was not an abolitionist; against what he considered the abolitionists' habit of using [...] "every form of language calculated to inflame", he felt that the movement was going too far. This lack of support dismayed friends like James Russell Lowell, who once told Holmes he should be more outspoken against slavery. Holmes calmly responded, [...] "Let me try to improve and please my fellowmen after my own fashion at present." [...] Nonetheless, Holmes believed that slavery could be ended peacefully and legally.|$|E

2500|$|It {{may be that}} an {{injunction}} prohibiting the sale of VTR's would harm the interests of copyright holders who <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>objection</b> to others making copies of their programs. But such concerns should and would {{be taken into account}} in fashioning an appropriate remedy once liability has been found. Remedies may well be available that would not interfere with authorized time-shifting at all ... Sony may be able, for example, to build a VTR that enables broadcasters to scramble the signal of individual programs and [...] "jam" [...] the unauthorized recording of them....|$|E

2500|$|Proposals for {{partitioning}} Punjab {{had been}} made starting from 1908. Its proponents included the Hindu leader Bhai Parmanand, Congress leader Lala Lajpat Rai, industrialist G. D. Birla, and various Sikh leaders. After the Lahore resolution (1940) of the Muslim League demanding Pakistan, B. R. Ambedkar wrote a 400-page tract titled Thoughts on Pakistan, wherein he discussed {{the boundaries of the}} Muslim and non-Muslim regions of Punjab and Bengal. His calculations showed a Muslim majority in 16 western districts of Punjab and non-Muslim majority in 13 eastern districts. In Bengal, he showed non-Muslim majority in 15 districts. He thought the Muslims could <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>objection</b> to redrawing provincial boundaries. If they did, they did not quite [...] "understand the nature of their own demand".|$|E
2500|$|Khan and Farooq {{find the}} commandment {{suspicious}} {{on the grounds}} that it makes no sense. Why would anyone ever trade equal quantities of the same kind of commodity ("like for like") -- for example 100 kilograms of wheat for 100 kg of wheat -- in a riba-free transaction called for by quoted ahadith? [...] Or how could [...] "divine law" [...] prescribe that a jeweller [...] "who has spent his time and effort to convert gold into jewelery" [...] not be compensated (if trading for gold)? Khan also notes that the authors of the IIIE blueprint <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>objection</b> to traders selling higher purity/quality commodity for cash and using the proceeds to buying more less purity/quality commodity, and wonders what would be accomplished by such [...] "an ineffective and roundabout method of handling a simple exchange transaction!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Benedict's remarks at his Angelus {{appearance}} initially {{received a}} mixed yet predominantly negative response. Mohammed Sayed Tantawi, Grand Imam of Al-Azhar Mosque, Cairo, a Sunni institution, stated [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>objection</b> if the Pope holds another speech and declares publicly {{that what the}} Byzantine emperor had said was wrong. At the same time, the Pope has to apologize frankly and justify what he said," [...] Mohammed Habib, deputy leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's main Islamic opposition group originally, {{not long after the}} Pope's Sunday statements, called them a sufficient apology. However, later in the day, he retracted that statement, saying, [...] "The Pope's comments that downplayed his earlier remarks are not enough. We will not accept anything less than an apology," [...] Mohammed Habib also said: [...] "It does not {{rise to the level of}} a clear apology and, based on this, we're calling on the Pope of the Vatican to issue a clear apology that will decisively end any confusion.|$|E
