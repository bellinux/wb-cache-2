50|$|<b>Flush</b> <b>mount</b> albums have hard covers with thick, {{unbending}} pages. They {{consist of}} photographic prints that were dry-mounted on cardboard. The covers are mostly made of leather, leatherette or glass. The photos lie completely flat and extend {{across the whole}} page. <b>Flush</b> <b>mount</b> albums are usually designed in magazine-style. They are most often used for special occasions such as weddings and anniversaries {{due to the fact}} that they are produced at a higher quality and are more expensive to produce than coffee table books.|$|R
60|$|She {{put down}} her work, laid her {{beautiful}} arms on the table, {{and looked at him}} for some moments without answering. Gradually the <b>flush</b> <b>mounted</b> her cheek.|$|E
6000|$|A <b>flush</b> <b>mounted</b> in Val's cheeks--that {{scene in}} the Pandemonium promenade--the dark man with the pink {{carnation}} developing into his own father! [...] "But {{you know what the}} Forsytes are," [...] he said almost viciously. [...] "Oh! I forgot; you don't." ...|$|E
6000|$|A quick <b>flush</b> <b>mounted</b> to {{the young}} girl's cheeks. [...] "But this is a SECURITY, Mr. Rushbrook," [...] she said proudly, handing him back the paper, [...] "and my uncle does not require that. Nor shall I insult him or you by sending it." ...|$|E

50|$|Digital photo {{books have}} {{digitally}} printed pages {{as opposed to}} albums that consist of traditional photos. Both <b>flush</b> <b>mount</b> albums as well as coffee table books are printed digitally. The photos of <b>flush</b> <b>mount</b> albums are printed on photographic paper, which {{is comparable to the}} quality of traditionally developed photos. Coffee table books, on the other hand, are printed with inkjet on ordinary paper and are therefore of a lower quality. Digital printing gives the album designer a vast number of design possibilities, for example magazine-style or montage albums are only possible with digital printing.|$|R
60|$|A {{moment he}} looked up at her, his smile broadening, a <b>flush</b> <b>mounting</b> to his cheek-bones. Then he rose and sent his chair {{crashing}} behind him to the ground.|$|R
60|$|As the trainer, with raised lash, hesitated {{an instant}} at the {{entrance}} to the box where the boy and the ape confronted him, a tall broad-shouldered man pushed past him and entered. As his eyes fell upon the newcomer a slight <b>flush</b> <b>mounted</b> the boy's cheeks.|$|E
60|$|A deep <b>flush</b> <b>mounted</b> to the man's {{neck and}} face. He {{did not turn}} about to face the girl he had so grievously wronged--for the life of him {{he could not have}} met her eyes. Slowly he turned, and with gaze bent upon the ground walked quickly toward Theriere.|$|E
60|$|A <b>flush</b> <b>mounted</b> to his face, {{his chin}} went up, and there {{came to his}} lips bitter words of sarcasm. With an effort, however, he held his tongue, and, turning his back upon the king, his broad {{shoulders}} proclaiming the contempt he felt, he walked slowly out of the room.|$|E

50|$|The {{magnetic}} lock {{should always be}} installed on the secure side of the door. Most installations are surface mounted. For safety, {{magnetic lock}}, cables, and wires should be routed through the door frame or <b>flush</b> <b>mount</b> with wire moulding.|$|R
60|$|Like a flash {{her small}} white hand {{went out and}} smacked his face. He started up, glaring at her. They stared at each other. Slowly the <b>flush</b> <b>mounted</b> her cheek, she dropped her eyes, then her head. He sat down sulkily. She went into the scullery to adjust her hair. In private there she shed a few tears, {{she did not know}} what for.|$|E
6000|$|A dark <b>flush</b> <b>mounted</b> to the King's forehead, and {{his eyes}} were gorged with his wrath. [...] "No more of this, for God's dignity!" [...] he cried. [...] "Had we this fellow at the Tower, a few turns of the rack would tear a {{confession}} from his craven soul. But why should we need his word for his own guilt? You have seen, my lords, you have heard! How say you, fair son? Is the man guilty?" ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Stokes {{watched the}} two men from under her broad felt hat. She had seen {{hundreds}} of Alberts, khaki soldiers standing in loose attitudes, absorbed in watching nothing in particular. She had seen also a good many Joes, quiet, good-looking young soldiers with half-averted faces. But {{there was something in}} the turn of Joe's head, and something in his quiet, tender-looking form, young and fresh--which attracted her eye. As she watched him closely from below, he turned as if he felt her, and his dark-blue eye met her straight, light-blue gaze. He faltered and turned aside again and looked as if he were going to fall off the truck. A slight <b>flush</b> <b>mounted</b> under the girl's full, ruddy face. She liked him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{knew him}} well too," [...] the prince said, [...] "and his reputation. We do not doubt what you say, young gentleman," [...] he added quickiy, seeing a <b>flush</b> <b>mount</b> into Ronald's face; [...] "but in truth it seems strange that such {{should have been}} the case." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I must go now. It {{is getting}} late," [...] said Dick {{after a little}} more talk. He turned, to see Sam, Dora and the Laning girls only a few seats away. Dora was looking fully at Minnie Sanderson with wide open eyes and a <b>flush</b> <b>mounting</b> to her cheeks.|$|R

60|$|The boat swiftly {{ascended the}} current, and {{presently}} the steeper shores {{were left behind}} and the banks fell away in long upward sloping fields, with farm-houses and with stacks of harvest dimly visible in the generous expanses. By and by they passed a fisherman drawing his nets, and bending from his boat, there near Albany, N. Y., in the picturesque immortal attitudes of Raphael's Galilean fisherman; and now a <b>flush</b> <b>mounted</b> the pale face of the east, and through the dewy coolness of the dawn there came, more to the sight than any other sense, a vague menace of heat. But as yet the air was deliciously fresh and sweet, and Basil bathed his weariness in it, thinking with a certain luxurious compassion of the scalded man, {{and how he was}} to fare that day. This poor wretch seemed of another order of beings, as the calamitous always seem to the happy, and Basil's pity was quite an abstraction; which, again, amused and shocked him, and he asked his heart of bliss to consider of sorrow a little more earnestly as the lot of all men, and not merely of an alien creature here and there. He dutifully tried to imagine another issue to the disaster of the night, and to realize himself suddenly bereft of her who so filled his life. He bade his soul remember that, in the security of sleep, Death had passed them both so close that his presence might well have chilled their dreams, as the iceberg that grazes the ship in the night freezes all the air about it. But it was quite idle: where love was, life only was; and sense and spirit alike put aside the burden that he would have laid upon them; his revery reflected with delicious caprice the looks, the tones, the movements that he loved, and bore him far away from the sad images that he had invited to mirror themselves in it.|$|E
