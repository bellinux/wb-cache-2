5|$|Finally, Putnam's {{internal}} realism {{has been}} accused by Curtis Brown of being a disguised form of subjective idealism. If this is the case, it <b>is</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> traditional arguments against that position. In particular, it falls {{into the trap of}} solipsism. That is, if existence depends on experience, as subjective idealism maintains, and if one's consciousness were to stop existing, then the rest of the universe would stop existing as well.|$|E

5|$|A lepton is an elementary, half-integer spin {{particle}} {{that does}} not undergo strong interactions but <b>is</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pauli exclusion principle; no two leptons {{of the same species}} can be in exactly the same state at the same time. Two main classes of leptons exist: charged leptons (also known as the electron-like leptons), and neutral leptons (better known as neutrinos). Electrons are stable and the most common charged lepton in the Universe, whereas muons and taus are unstable particle that quickly decay after being produced in high energy collisions, such as those involving cosmic rays or carried out in particle accelerators.|$|E

5|$|Although {{not a true}} coral, Millepora alcicornis <b>is</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{same general}} threats that corals and coral reefs are facing. The {{greatest}} of these is global warming and the consequent rise in sea temperatures. Millepora alcicornis {{is one of the}} first corals to show bleaching as the symbiont zooxanthellae are killed. However, it is also more resilient than most and becomes re-established by recruitment earlier than the scleractinian corals. Other general threats to reefs include ocean acidification, pollution, sedimentation, invasive species and other changes in species dynamics, coral diseases, fisheries, leisure activities and tourism. Small quantities of Millepora alcicornis are gathered for sale to collectors.|$|E
5|$|As the ANAK Society is ostensibly {{a student}} {{organization}} at Georgia Tech, it <b>is</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same {{rules and regulations}} as other student organizations. The society files paperwork with Georgia Tech administration and the Student Government Association, holds elections for each of its four mandatory officer positions (president, vice president, treasurer, and secretary) and is formally advised by a Georgia Tech faculty member. The president's name must be kept on file in the Office of Leadership and Civic Engagement, available to any student who seeks it. As of 2007, the society's current faculty advisor is Gary S. May, {{the dean of the}} College of Engineering and an ANAK member since 1985.|$|E
5|$|Chicago Landmark is a {{designation}} of the Mayor of Chicago and the Chicago City Council for historic buildings and other sites in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Listed sites are selected after meeting {{a combination of}} criteria, including historical, economic, architectural, artistic, cultural, and social values. Once a site is designated as a landmark, it <b>is</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Chicago Landmarks Ordinance, which requires that any alterations beyond routine maintenance, {{up to and including}} demolition, must have their permit reviewed by the Landmarks Commission. Many Chicago Landmarks are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places, providing federal tax support for preservation, and some are further designated National Historic Landmarks, providing additional federal oversight.|$|E
50|$|Uniformed {{service members}} are {{permitted}} to make contributions from both basic pay {{as well as from}} incentive, special, or bonus pay, but <b>are</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> regular contribution limits.

5|$|Peter I Island {{is one of}} Norway's two {{territorial}} {{claims in}} Antarctica, the other being Queen Maud Land. Peter I Island is the only claim within 90°W and 150°W and is also the only claim {{which is not a}} sector. Being south of 60°S, the island <b>is</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Antarctic Treaty. The treaty ensures free access to the island for any scientific investigation, and states that it can only be used for peaceful purposes. Norway, Australia, France, New Zealand and the United Kingdom have all mutually recognized each other's claims in Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|Svalbard is an {{archipelago}} in the Arctic Ocean {{under the}} full sovereignty of Norway, but <b>is</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> special status {{granted by the}} Svalbard Treaty. Jan Mayen is a remote island in the Arctic Ocean; it has no permanent population and is administrated by the County Governor of Nordland. Svalbard and Jan Mayen have in common {{that they are the}} only integrated parts of Norway not allocated to counties. While a separate ISO code for Svalbard was proposed by the United Nations, it was the Norwegian authorities who took initiative to include Jan Mayen in the code. Its official language is Norwegian.|$|E
5|$|The Municipal Act, 2001 is the {{legislation}} that enables incorporation and stipulates governance of Ontario's municipalities, excluding the City of Toronto, which <b>is</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> City of Toronto Act, 2006. The Municipal Act, 2001 provides lower and single-tier municipalities with the authority to incorporate as cities, towns, villages, townships, or generically as municipalities. There are no minimum population thresholds or other requirements for these municipal sub-types. A municipality can change its status {{to any of these}} so long as its resulting name is not being used by another municipality. For upper-tier municipalities, the act provides them with the authority to incorporate as counties, regions and district municipalities.|$|E

5|$|The {{eccentricity}} {{of their}} orbits causes regular flexing {{of the three}} moons' shapes, with Jupiter's gravity stretching them out as they approach it and allowing them to spring back to more spherical shapes as they swing away. This tidal flexing heats the moons' interiors by friction. This is seen most dramatically in the extraordinary volcanic activity of innermost Io (which <b>is</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> strongest tidal forces), {{and to a lesser}} degree in the geological youth of Europa's surface (indicating recent resurfacing of the moon's exterior).|$|E
5|$|When an {{electron}} is moving through a magnetic field, it <b>is</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Lorentz force that acts perpendicularly {{to the plane}} defined by the magnetic field and the electron velocity. This centripetal force causes the electron to follow a helical trajectory through the field at a radius called the gyroradius. The acceleration from this curving motion induces the electron to radiate {{energy in the form}} of synchrotron radiation. The energy emission in turn causes a recoil of the electron, known as the Abraham–Lorentz–Dirac Force, which creates a friction that slows the electron. This force is caused by a back-reaction of the electron's own field upon itself.|$|E
5|$|The primary uniform (jersey, {{shorts and}} socks) is red with {{alternating}} lighter and darker horizontal bands, black sleeves with red trim, and a vertical black band below each sleeve extending {{the full length}} of the jersey. The secondary uniform includes white jerseys with a large red horizontal band below a smaller blue band across the chest with blue and red trim, white socks with blue trim, and with either red or blue shorts (the choice of which <b>is</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> opponent uniform). In its first three seasons, Toronto FC's secondary uniform colours were light and dark grey. In the following four seasons the team wore white secondary uniforms, whereas in 2014, the secondary uniforms were changed to onyx. As with all MLS teams, the uniforms are produced by Adidas. In 2013 and 2014, a shadow-print maple leaf was featured on Toronto FC's primary jerseys.|$|E
