40|$|AbstractThe {{absence of}} long sub-daily {{rainfall}} records can hamper development of continuous streamflow forecasting systems run at sub-daily time steps. We test {{the hypothesis that}} simple disaggregation of daily rainfall data to hourly data, combined with hourly streamflow data, {{can be used to}} establish efficient hourly rainfall-runoff models. The approach is tested on four rainfall-runoff models and a range of meso-scale catchments (150 – 3500  km 2). We also compare our disaggregation approach to a method of parameter scaling that attains an hourly parameter-set from daily <b>data.</b> Simple <b>disaggregation</b> of daily rainfall produces hourly streamflow models that perform almost as well as those developed from hourly rainfall <b>data.</b> Rainfall <b>disaggregation</b> performs at least as well as parameter scaling, and often better.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{formulate}} an analytical-informational-theoretical approach which, given the incomplete nature of the available micro-level data, can be used to provide disaggregated values of a given variable. A functional relationship between the variable to be disaggregated and the available variables/indicators at the area level is specified through a combination of different macro- and micro-data sources. <b>Data</b> <b>disaggregation</b> is accomplished by considering two different cases. In the first case, sub-area level information on the variable of interest is available, and a generalized maximum entropy approach is employed to estimate the optimal disaggregate model.

The proposed spatial-disaggregation approach is used in relation to an Italian data set in order to compute the value-added per manufacturing sector of local labour systems within the Umbria region, by combining the available micro/macro-level data and by formulating a suitable set of constraints for the optimization problem in the presence of errors in micro-aggregates. <b>data</b> <b>disaggregation,</b> maximum entropy, cross-entropy,...|$|E

To solve the research problem a model of <b>data</b> <b>disaggregation</b> was developed, taking the utmost of previous information available in earlier studies. The proposed model {{was based on the}} ideas of generalized maximum entropy (GME) and minimum generalized crossed entropy (MGCE), in order to obtain a series of disaggregated data related to the forest and agricultural occupation, considering two levels of disaggregation and following two steps: 1) the creation of a basis at the aggregated level (Markov transition matrixes, estimated by the maximum entropy); 2) <b>data</b> <b>disaggregation,</b> based on the previous established basis. The model also involves two application variants: simultaneous disaggregation of data as well as a direct one (to solve the problems that might appear in the previous one and maximize the recovered information). Moreover, a model based on these principles is proposed to the disaggregation of the livestock data. The model is applied to the disaggregation of data in the municipality of Castelo de Vide.

40|$|<b>Data</b> <b>disaggregation</b> (or downscaling) is {{becoming}} a recognized modeling framework to improve the spatial resolution of available surface soil moisture satellite products. However, depending {{on the quality of}} the scale change modeling and on the uncertainty in its input <b>data,</b> <b>disaggregation</b> may improve or degrade soil moisture information at high resolution. Hence, defining a relevant metric for evaluating such methodologies is crucial before disaggregated data can be eventually used in fine-scale studies. In this paper, a new metric, named G(DOWN), is proposed to assess the potential gain provided by disaggregation relative to the non-disaggregation case. The performance metric is tested during a four-year period by comparing 1 -km resolution disaggregation based on physical and theoretical scale change (DISPATCH) data with the soil moisture measurements collected by six stations in central Morocco. DISPATCH data are obtained every 2 - 3 days from 40 -km resolution SMOS (Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity) and 1 -km resolution optical MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data. The correlation coefficient between G(DOWN) and the disaggregation gain in time series correlation, mean bias and bias in the slope of the linear fit ranges from 0. 5 to 0. 8. The new metric is found to be a good indicator of the overall performance of DISPATCH. Especially, the sign of G(DOWN) (positive in the case of effective disaggregation and negative in the opposite case) is independent of the uncertainties in SMOS data and of the representativeness of localized in situ measurements at the downscaling (1 km) resolution. In contrast, the traditional root mean square difference between disaggregation output and in situ measurements is poorly correlated (correlation coefficient of about 0. 0) with the disaggregation gain in terms of both time series correlation and bias in the slope of the linear fit. The G(DOWN) approach is generic and thus could help test a range of downscaling methods dedicated to soil moisture and to other geophysical variables...|$|E

This is based on the observation that the total signal often varies widely across the unknown sources, and we often have a good idea of what total values to expect.

A convex quadratic program for approximate inference is employed for recovering those source signals.
