A stop-motion model is used in several scenes in the film involving the Terminator's skeletal frame. Cameron wanted to convince the audience that {{the model of the}} structure was capable of <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> saw Schwarzenegger doing. To allow this, a scene was filmed of Schwarzenegger injured and limping away; this limp made it easier for the model to imitate Schwarzenegger.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{tells us}} that, on seeing {{the outcome of}} the battle hung in the balance, the {{disarmed}} Samians had joined in {{on the side of the}} allies, <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> could. This inspired the other Ionian contingents to turn on the Persians as well. At which stage in the battle this happened is not clear; the Samians were presumably not in the main battle line (being disarmed), so it may have been after the Persians retreated to the camp. Meanwhile, the Milesians who were guarding the passes of Mycale also turned on the Persians. At first they misdirected the fleeing Persian contingents so that they ended up back amongst the Allied troops; then, perhaps seeing {{the outcome of the}} battle was certain, they began killing the fleeing Persians.|$|E

Alliance with Athens again looked unattractive and the allies complained.|$|E

25|$|On 24 April 1992 Ms Amey {{was one of}} {{five members}} of a Meteorological Service team, {{stationed}} on the remote sub-Antarctic Campbell Island, who were snorkelling when one of them, Mr Mike Fraser, was attacked by a shark, {{believed to be a}} white pointer. The other swimmers, apart from Ms Amey, swam to shore. Ms Amey waited until the shark moved away from Mr Fraser and then went to his aid and towed him to shore. Mr Fraser had lost his right forearm and his left forearm was severely lacerated and appeared to be broken. He was having trouble breathing and required urgent medical treatment. Having got him to shore, Ms Amey then joined {{the rest of the team}} in <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> could for Mr Fraser until he could be flown to New Zealand. Ms Amey displayed great courage and bravery with complete disregard for her own safety in going to Mr Fraser's assistance.|$|E

25|$|The Hellfire Club {{was then}} {{able to claim}} Jean {{as one of their}} members. By using the {{combined}} telepathic powers of both Emma and the Stepford Cuckoos, they mentally tricked Jean into <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wanted by using images of Scott and Professor X. But the mental contact was interrupted by Scott's unusually strong physic/telepathic connection to Jean. The Stepford Cuckoos then tried to release the Phoenix Force so they could be hosts, and seemingly succeeded. Emma was shocked when she learned the true purpose was for the Inner Circle to control the vastly limitless power and energy of the Phoenix when she originally thought that they were trying to release the Phoenix back into space to prevent the world from destruction. Jean and Cyclops then left to fight the Phoenix, but not before Jean angrily pinned Emma to the wall and telekinetically bound Emma with iron pipes after seeing Emma passionately kiss Cyclops (leading her to suspect that Emma may have plotted to steal Cyclops from her). Jean was unable to subdue the Phoenix herself, prompting Cyclops to attack the cosmic entity, only to be struck down as Jean watched in horror. Before the Phoenix could kill Cyclops, Emma, freed by Wolverine, arrived and took the Phoenix Force into herself, seemingly dying in the process by shattering into several diamond fragments. Jean has rejoined the X-Men and her memories have since returned and appeared to have reconciled with Cyclops.|$|E

Matthies feels that all characters, particularly the allies, contain some dimension of his own personality. [...] "They're an expression of something {{that is part of}} me that I think is interesting to explore," [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|Chandler's {{budget was}} limited, so {{in an effort}} to reduce {{expenditures}} he and Hendrix completed much of the album's pre-production work at their shared apartment. From the start, Chandler intentionally minimized the creative input of Mitchell and Redding. He later explained: [...] "I wasn't concerned that Mitch or Noel might feel that they weren't having enough—or any—say... I had been touring and recording in a band for years, and I'd seen everything end as a compromise. Nobody ended up <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> really wanted to do. I was not going to let that happen with Jimi." [...] When the Experience began studio rehearsals, Hendrix already had the chord sequences and tempos worked out for Mitchell, and Chandler would direct Redding's bass parts.|$|E

Similarly, most members of Infinity Ward were supportive of [...] "No Russian", but Alavi did note that there were some members who strongly opposed the content. By contrast, game testers elicited a variety of reactions. Many testers were initially angry and confused at the level's content, but eventually settled down and began shooting at the civilians. One tester, who at the time was enlisted in the United States Armed Forces, refused to play the level at all, but was willing to play the rest of the game. This led to the implementation of the skip feature, as Alavi did not want the player to be punished for not <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> felt was morally wrong.|$|E

Wizard Magazine ranked the Flood as the 77th Greatest Villains of all time, Game Daily ranked them 5th of their [...] "Top 25 Enemies of All Time", and PC World ranked the Flood the 31st [...] "Most Diabolical Video-Game Villains of All Time". Electronic Gaming Monthly ranked the Flood in their top ten list of [...] "badass undead". MTV considered Flood possession in Halo3 as a [...] "great gaming moment" [...] of 2007, stating that [...] "with the power of the Xbox 360's graphics, this reanimation comes to vivid, distressing life, more memorably than it had in the earlier games.

[...] Former Working Designs president Victor Ireland wrote that [...] "It's actually a good thing... because now Sega will survive, <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> do best: software." [...] The staff of Newsweek remarked [...] "From Sonic to Shenmue, Sega's programmers have produced some of the most engaging experiences in the history of interactive media... Unshackled by a struggling console platform, this platoon of world-class software developers can do what they do best for any machine on the market". Rosen predicted [...] "they have the potential to catch Electronic Arts". Game Informer, commenting on Sega's tendency to produce under-appreciated cult classics, stated: [...] "Let us rejoice in the fact that Sega is making games equally among the current console crop, so that history will not repeat itself." ...|$|E

500|$|George Hertzberg, a University of Southern California {{graduate}} {{with experience in}} sitcoms and commercials, was chosen based on one of Adam's monologues he was given to read for the audition. Hertzberg counted luck and being {{in the right place}} at the right time in helping him get the role. Many recurring characters on Buffy start with one or two episodes, and when the writers or producers like their chemistry with other actors, they often make them a regular part of the cast. Hertzberg, however, understood at his reading that Adam was to be a major part of the fourth season. Casting Director Amy Britt needed someone physically imposing for the part, with the [...] Hertzberg fitting the bill. Britt stated, [...] "this is a guy we're going to want eventually to have some affinity for. We can't just see him as an evil being. He is evil to the core [...] should scare us with his actions; but there's also innocence. Like the Frankenstein monster, you realize that they're only <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> know.

[...] Badu's iChat contacts, including hip hop producers Questlove, Madlib, 9th Wonder, and J Dilla, instant messaged her {{to get back into}} the studio and sent her tracks. Such exchanges inspired a creative spark for Badu, which she explained in an interview for the Dallas Observer, [...] "I started to accept that maybe it's OK for me to put out music, and it doesn't have to be something dynamic or world-changing. But just as I was accepting that, here comes this burst of light and energy and creativity. And that's the process, I guess, of life—the detachment and the release of something gives you even more room to grow or be creative." ...|$|E

[...] However, de Matteo also noted that Angie is [...] "not just the brassy smart-talker" [...] and has a vulnerable side, which would be explored in the show. Cherry boosted Angie as [...] "a loving but tough Italian woman... who will do what she has to protect her family." [...] He also described her as [...] "brilliant" [...] and [...] "shielded," [...] which leaves her largely detached from the other women on the series. Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly described the character as [...] "icy." [...] Entertainment Weekly Tanner Stransky wrote that Angie was [...] "very real and very gritty," [...] noting that the character was capable [...] "of <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> need to survive, no matter what the price."

500|$|The character, of Turkish descent, is {{described}} as being [...] "torn between two worlds", which Hussen explained are her traditional family life and modern London life. Naz is a family girl who has reached a point in her life where she wants to have fun, but is also a daddy's girl, the apple of her father's eye. He sees her as a perfect student. She has {{a good relationship with}} her parents and is respectful of them, <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want, even though they do not know her very well. She loves her family but they do not understand her or what she wants. Hussen opined that Naz would be a good girl if her family did understand her more. What Naz wants is to be like everyone around her {{and to be able to}} pick her own boyfriend, but being from a Muslim family means she is unable to. She tries to keep each side of her life secret from the other, but more of each side is seen as the series goes on, and they eventually meet, leading to bad consequences. Hussen opined that this is a common real-life situation that is rarely portrayed on television, so girls would be able relate to the character. Naz likes to make everyone happy but ultimately is more likely to think about her own happiness; she likes to get her own way.|$|E
500|$|At Metacritic, which assigns a {{normalised}} rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream critics, The King of Limbs has an average score of 80 based on 40 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". BBC Music's Mike Diver {{described it as}} [...] "a fans-pleasing eighth album from Britain's most consistently brilliant band." [...] Michael Brodeur of the Boston Globe praised [...] "the tense calm these eight songs maintain—a composure that feels constantly ready to crack", and write that [...] "where In Rainbows was mellow but brisk — an album that felt on its way somewhere — these songs are eerie and insidious, creeping like shadows — and, often because of the haunting voice of Thom Yorke, the occasional chill." [...] PopMatters Corey Beasley wrote: [...] "The King of Limbs is a beautiful record, one that begs more of a conscious listen than its predecessor, but one that provides equal – if different – thrills in doing so." [...] François Marchand of the Vancouver Sun said that the album [...] "bridges Radiohead's many different styles" [...] and was [...] "worth embracing". AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine described it as [...] "the sound of Radiohead <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> do, doing it very well, doing it without flash or pretension, gently easing from the role of pioneers to craftsmen". Critic Robert Christgau awarded the album a two-star [...] "honourable mention" [...] and recommended the songs [...] "Little by Little" [...] and [...] "Bloom".|$|E
500|$|Libby Hill of the Los Angeles Times {{commented on}} how Jessica Jones exposed modern day sexism and {{misogyny}} through Kilgrave's {{use of the}} phrase [...] "Smile", calling the season [...] "the most innocuous and incisive cultural critique" [...] from Marvel to date. Hill likened an early scene that shows Kilgrave asking Jones to smile, and her obliging, to [...] "similar well-meaning scenarios [...] play out {{in the real world}} time and again each day" [...] many in the form of gendered street harassment, that resonates with many women. Hill also added that [...] "Kilgrave serves as an exaggerated representation of perceived consent," [...] due to the response he gives later in the season to Jessica about never knowing if someone is <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want or what he tells them to do. She concludes that [...] "Jessica Jones is revolutionary because in acknowledging casual misogyny and exaggerating its most destructive tendencies, it exposes the pervasive toxicity therein. It does all of this without making a show of its politics, instead resting easy on the knowledge that all too many women will relate to the subtleties of its premise." [...] Amy C. Chambers, writing for The Science and Entertainment Laboratory, noted how the season moved away from sexism even more so than the comics, by changing Kilgrave's abilities from phermone based, with a particular effect on women, to viral, with equal effect no matter gender, indicating that [...] "powerlessness is not gendered." ...|$|E
