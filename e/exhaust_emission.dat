In 1972 David Brown paid off all its debts, {{said to be}} £5 million or more, and handed it for £101 to Company Developments, a Birmingham-based {{investment}} bank consortium chaired by accountant William Willson. More detail on this period may be read at Willson's biography. The worldwide recession, lack of working capital and the difficulties of developing without proper resources an engine to meet California's <b>exhaust</b> <b>emission</b> requirements — it stopped Aston's US sales — again pulled Aston Martin into receivership {{at the end of}} 1974.

The 455 engine disappeared after the 1976 model year, in favor of smaller, more efficient engines.|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{development}} of the shipping industry has brought great economic benefits but at a great environmental cost; <b>exhaust</b> <b>emissions</b> originating from ships are increasing, causing serious atmospheric pollution. Hence, the mitigation of ship <b>exhaust</b> <b>emissions</b> {{and the establishment of}} the sustainable ecosystem have become urgent tasks, which will require complicated and comprehensive systematic approaches to solve.

Factors correlated with ship <b>exhaust</b> <b>emissions</b> are identified, and a causal loop diagram is drawn to describe the complicated interrelations among the correlated factors.
