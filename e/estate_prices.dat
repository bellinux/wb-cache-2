5|$|Business {{declined}} {{during the}} construction and blasting of the station, with many storefronts losing business and some even being forced to close. However, starting in 2013, construction of the station has caused the value of real estate {{in the area to}} start to rise. Although the surrounding area's real <b>estate</b> <b>prices</b> had been declining since the 1990s, there had been increases in the purchases and leases of residential units around the area, causing real <b>estate</b> <b>prices</b> to rise again. On the Upper East Side, prices of real estate west of Third Avenue had historically been higher than prices east of there, but due to the subway's construction, prices of real estate east of the avenue had risen dramatically since the station's construction started. With the opening of the new station, business owners hoped to see an increase in patronage.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} part of the {{original}} Second Avenue Subway as outlined in the Program for Action in 1968. Construction on that project started in 1972, but stalled in 1975 due to lack of funding. In 2007, a separate measure authorized a first phase of the Second Avenue Line to be built between 65th and 105th Streets, with stations at 72nd, 86th, and 96th Streets. The station opened on January 1, 2017, as an intermediate station along Phase 1. Since opening, the presence of the Second Avenue Subway's three Phase 1 stations has improved real <b>estate</b> <b>prices</b> along the corridor.|$|E
5|$|Between 1907 and 1913, a {{development}} boom occurred in Lethbridge, {{making it the}} main marketing, distribution and service centre in southern Alberta. Such municipal projects as a water treatment plant, a power plant, a streetcar system, and exhibition buildings — {{as well as a}} construction boom and rising real <b>estate</b> <b>prices</b> — transformed the mining town into a significant city. Between World WarI and World WarII, however, the city experienced an economic slump. Development slowed, drought drove farmers from their farms, and coal mining rapidly declined from its peak. After World WarII, irrigation of farmland near Lethbridge led to growth in the city's population and economy. Lethbridge College (previously Lethbridge Community College) opened in April 1957 and the University of Lethbridge in 1967.|$|E

With Magdalena's pregnancy progressing, Carlos offers to financially support her and {{to act as a}} surrogate father for the child once it is born. When James discovers his partner's affair with Carlos he feels betrayed and Tomas soon receives a letter notifying him that his landlords are evicting him. Tomas, Magdalena and Carlos struggle to find an affordable place to live due to the gentrification of the area and the rising real <b>estate</b> <b>prices,</b> but Tomas dies in his sleep shortly before they are due to be evicted. In the aftermath, Magdalena is reunited with her mother and together they visit a gynecologist, who confirms that Magdalena conceived without having penetrative sex.

5|$|The {{station was}} not {{originally}} proposed {{as part of}} the Program for Action in 1968, but a later revision to that plan entailed building a Second Avenue Subway with one of its stops located at 72nd Street. Construction on that project started in 1972, but stalled in 1975 due to lack of funding. In 2007, a separate measure authorized a first phase of the Second Avenue Line to be built between 65th and 105th Streets, with stations at 72nd, 86th, and 96th Streets. The station opened on January 1, 2017, with provisions to extend the line south to Houston Street in Phase 3.

Four alternative methods for constructing real <b>estate</b> <b>price</b> indexes are discussed: the repeat sales model; the use of assessment information along with property sale information; stratification methods and hedonic methods.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{assumptions about}} future prices used {{in real estate}} applications of DCF models. We confirm both the widespread reliance on an ad hoc rule of increasing period-zero capitalization rates by 50 to 100 basis points to obtain terminal capitalization rates and {{the inability of the}} rule to project future real <b>estate</b> <b>pricing.</b> To understand how investors form expectations about future prices, we model the spread between the contemporaneously period-zero going-in and terminal capitalization rates and the spread between terminal rates assigned in period zero and going-in rates assigned in period N. Our regression results confirm statistical relationships between the terminal and next holding period going-in capitalization rate spread and the period-zero discount rate, although other economically significant variables are statistically insignificant. Linking terminal capitalization rates by assumption to going-in capitalization rates implies investors view future real <b>estate</b> <b>pricing</b> with myopic expectations. We discuss alternative specifications devoid of such linkage that align more with a rational expectations view of future real <b>estate</b> <b>pricing...</b>|$|R

Monetary {{policy has}} a {{significant}} effect on real <b>estate</b> <b>price,</b> and monetary policymakers need to have quick response. Based on the assumptions that monetary policy and real <b>estate</b> <b>price</b> influence each other and variables affect one another with a lag, A VAR model is designed and modified. Through impulse-response analysis and variance analysis, the influence of money supply and that of interest rate on real <b>estate</b> <b>price</b> are tested and compared. We found that: both money supply and interest rate could affect the real estate price; interest rate has a bigger influence that money supply does; as time goes on, the influence of money supply changes little, but that of interest rate enhances; interest rate policy is not easy to control and it will lead to a fluctuation of economy and the fluctuation may enhance, money supply is a better method to regulate real estate industry instead. ?

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the suitability of}} four widely used real <b>estate</b> <b>price</b> indices (the S&P Case-Shiller Index; the FHFA index; the NCREIF NPI; and the historical NAREIT series) for valuing and monitoring the credit risk of U. S. mortgages. Our evaluation focuses on four properties of these indexes: unbiased estimation of the drift of real <b>estate</b> <b>price</b> dynamics; unbiased estimation of the volatility of real <b>estate</b> <b>price</b> dynamics; suitability for measuring correlation between interest rates and real estate prices; suitability for measuring growth dynamics, or the effects of real options components of real estate values. We find, despite their widespread use, that these indices generate downwardly biased estimates of the idiosyncratic volatility of prices around the index and, thus systematically undervalue embedded default options in mortgage products. We also identify other specific properties, or required assumptions underlying the construction of these indices, {{that are likely to}} be problematic for mortgage pricing. These properties include the fact that none of these indices adequately address the index number problem for real <b>estate</b> assets. These <b>price</b> metrics thus mix price and quantity dynamics in non-transparent ways leading to likely biases in the measurement of the correlation between real estate "prices" and economic fundamentals, such as interest rates, and expected skewness in real <b>estate</b> <b>price</b> distributions arising from the real option components of real estate values. Overall, this analysis suggests {{there is a need to}} re-evaluate the use of these indices for mortgage risk management and to develop dynamic hedonic price indices that both address the index number problem and allow for flexible specifications for price and quantity dynamics...|$|R
