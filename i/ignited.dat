5|$|As {{inert gas}} is {{introduced}} into {{a mixture of}} hydrocarbon vapors and air, it increases the lower flammable limit or lowest concentration at which the vapors can be <b>ignited.</b> At {{the same time it}} decreases the upper flammable limit or highest concentration at which the vapors can be <b>ignited.</b> When the total concentration of oxygen in the tank reaches about 11%, the upper and lower flammable limits converge and the flammable range disappears.|$|E
5|$|Somalia's many Sultanates each {{maintained}} regular troops. In {{the early}} Middle Ages, {{the conquest of}} Shewa by the Ifat Sultanate <b>ignited</b> a rivalry for supremacy with the Solomonic dynasty.|$|E
50|$|When {{mixed with}} petrol or l-hexene, or other {{unsaturated}} hydrocarbons, vanadyl nitrate <b>ignites.</b> It does not <b>ignite</b> with hexane. It reacts with paper rubber and wood, and <b>ignites</b> many organic solvents.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>Ignite</b> {{was held}} in 2006 in Seattle, Washington by Brady Forrest and Bre Pettis, and was {{sponsored}} by O'Reilly Media and MAKE magazine. O'Reilly continued to support <b>Ignite</b> until November 2015 when the franchise was handed off to its founder, Brady Forrest, who formed <b>Ignite</b> Talks, PBC - a Public Benefit Corporation. <b>Ignite</b> Talks PBC was formed to be an independent organization focusing on supporting <b>Ignite</b> events {{around the world and}} promoting public speaking.|$|R

5|$|Iron {{chemical}} compounds have many uses. Iron oxide mixed with aluminium powder can be <b>ignited</b> {{to create a}} thermite reaction, used in welding and purifying ores. Iron forms binary compounds with the halogens and the chalcogens. Among its organometallic compounds is ferrocene, the first sandwich compound discovered.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Newton {{described}} comets as {{compact and}} durable solid bodies moving in oblique orbit and their tails as thin streams of vapor emitted by their nuclei, <b>ignited</b> or heated by the Sun. Newton suspected that comets were {{the origin of}} the life-supporting component of air.|$|E
5|$|Mobilized volunteers or prisoners symbolically {{tied to the}} Corps {{were left}} behind in Russia after the Russian Civil War was <b>ignited.</b> Various such {{individuals}} formed the Romanian Legion of Siberia, which resisted the Bolsheviks {{in cooperation with the}} Czechoslovak Legions and the White movement. These units were ultimately repatriated to Greater Romania in 1920.|$|E
5000|$|GridGain {{provides}} software {{built on}} the open source Apache <b>Ignite</b> project for the Java programming language, the [...]NET Framework and C++.In 2014, GridGain Systems donated their core code base to the Apache Software Foundation as the open source Apache <b>Ignite</b> project. The first release of Apache <b>Ignite</b> happened in early 2015, and it graduated from incubation in September 2015.For example, GridGain Enterprise Edition 7.5 corresponded to Apache <b>Ignite</b> 1.5 in February 2016.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the trigger}} is pulled, a firing pin <b>ignites</b> the primer, which then <b>ignites</b> a powder booster charge that pushes the bullet into the barrel. The solid block of {{propellant}} is broken up {{to increase the}} ignition surface area and <b>ignites,</b> accelerating the bullet out of the barrel.|$|R
5000|$|There may {{be delayed}} {{ignition}} as the oil spray {{is too far}} forward for the electrodes to <b>ignite,</b> only when the oil spray has filled the combustion chamber will the mixture <b>ignite.</b> In this condition {{it is likely that}} the excessive volume of unburnt oil will <b>ignite</b> with explosive ignition.|$|R
5|$|New {{fires were}} reported: Count Adam Christoffer Knuth's house in Pustervig, a cellar in Købmagergade (Market Street) and a haystack at Nørreport (Northern Gate) all {{broke out in}} flames; the latter likely <b>ignited</b> by embers carried by the wind.|$|E
5|$|On 5 August 1911, {{the ship}} {{suffered}} {{an explosion in}} one of her 12-inch guns when it failed to fire during gunnery practice. After some time passed, the breech was opened and <b>ignited</b> the propellant; the resulting fire killed 16 crewmen and several officers.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of September 11, 1957, {{plutonium}} shavings in a glove box located in building 771 (the Plutonium Recovery and Fabrication Facility) spontaneously <b>ignited.</b> The fire spread to the flammable glove box materials, including plexiglas windows and rubber gloves. The fire rapidly spread through the interconnected glove boxes and <b>ignited</b> the large bank of High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters located in a plenum downstream. Within minutes the first filters had burned out, allowing plutonium particles {{to escape from the}} building exhaust stacks. The building exhaust fans stopped operating due to fire damage at 10:40 PM, which ended the majority of the plutonium release. Fire fighters initially used carbon dioxide fire extinguishers because water can act as a moderator and cause plutonium to go critical. They resorted to water hoses when the dry fire extinguishers proved ineffective.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ignite</b> (<b>Ignite</b> Talks) is {{a series}} of events where {{speakers}} have five minutes to talk on a subject accompanied by 20 slides, for 15 seconds each, automatically advanced. <b>Ignite</b> started in Seattle, and it has spread to 350+ organizing teams in cities, universities, governments and companies who have hosted thousands of events.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2015, Rogers {{introduced}} a streamlined package structure, known as Rogers <b>Ignite.</b> The <b>Ignite</b> packages are aimed primarily towards streaming media, {{with the majority}} of the packages offering no usage caps. [...] In October 2015, Rogers launched <b>Ignite</b> Gigabit Internet, which supports 4K resolution streaming to Rogers Cable NextBox 4K receivers.|$|R
50|$|For {{stars with}} masses greater than 10.3 solar masses, oxygen <b>ignites</b> {{in the core}} or not at all. Similarly, for stars with a mass of less than 9 solar masses (without {{accretion}} of additional mass) oxygen <b>ignites</b> in the core or not at all. However, in the 9-10.3 solar mass range, oxygen <b>ignites</b> off-center.|$|R
5|$|Rockstar Games first {{confirmed}} the game's existence on 25 October 2011 in an announcement on its official website and Twitter feed. Take-Two Interactive's share price subsequently increased seven percent. Journalists said the announcement <b>ignited</b> significant anticipation within the gaming industry, which they {{owed to the}} series' cultural significance.|$|E
5|$|Zinc powder is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} propellant in model rockets. When a compressed mixture of 70% zinc and 30% sulfur powder is <b>ignited</b> there is a violent chemical reaction. This produces zinc sulfide, together with large amounts of hot gas, heat, and light.|$|E
5|$|After the crash, the North Tower burned for 102minutes before {{collapsing}} at 10:28A.M. Although {{the impact}} itself caused extensive structural damage, the long-lasting fire <b>ignited</b> by jet fuel was {{blamed for the}} structural failure of the tower. In addition to the aircraft passengers and building occupants, hundreds of rescue workers also died when the tower collapsed. Cantor Fitzgerald L.P., an investment bank on floors 101–105 of the World Trade Center One, lost 658employees, considerably {{more than any other}} employer.|$|E
50|$|Once {{the first}} stage is cleared, the second-stage motor <b>ignites</b> and burns for {{approximately}} 65 seconds. The nose fairing is then jettisoned, separating from the missile. When the nose fairing is cleared of the missile, the third-stage TVC subsystem <b>ignites,</b> and ordnance separates the second-stage motor. The third-stage motor then <b>ignites,</b> pushing the equipment section the remaining distance (approx. 40 seconds) of the flight. When the third-stage motor reaches the targeted area, the Post Boost Control System (PBCS) <b>ignites,</b> and the third-stage motor is ejected.|$|R
50|$|The fire 2 {{commands}} {{cause the}} redundant NSDs to fire through a thin barrier seal down a flame tunnel. This <b>ignites</b> a pyro booster charge, which is {{retained in the}} safe and arm device behind a perforated plate. The booster charge <b>ignites</b> the propellant in the igniter initiator; and combustion products of this propellant <b>ignite</b> the solid rocket motor initiator, which fires down the entire vertical length of the solid rocket motor <b>igniting</b> the solid rocket motor propellant along its entire surface area instantaneously.|$|R
5000|$|As {{well as the}} <b>Ignite</b> accelerated, {{there is}} also co-Ignite, {{which is similar to}} <b>Ignite</b> accelerated, except that {{children}} in co-Ignite do not [...] "skip" [...] year nine.|$|R
5|$|An enquiry {{into the}} crash was hastily set up. The commission's report (Aktenzeichen 52, Br.B.Nr. 270/42) {{concluded}} that the crash was caused by damage to the differential gear, which caused an oil leak. Then a number of teeth broke off the spur wheel and <b>ignited</b> the oil. Sabotage or human error was ruled out. The aircraft, W. Nr. 14256, was ferried to the unit via Bari, Italy. The mission that ended in its destruction was its first mission.|$|E
5|$|An {{oxide layer}} forms around {{beryllium}} that prevents further reactions with air unless heated above 1000°C. Once <b>ignited,</b> beryllium burns brilliantly forming {{a mixture of}} beryllium oxide and beryllium nitride. Beryllium dissolves readily in non-oxidizing acids, such as HCl and diluted H2SO4, but not in nitric acid or water as this forms the oxide. This behavior {{is similar to that}} of aluminium metal. Beryllium also dissolves in alkali solutions.|$|E
5|$|Another popular {{method of}} growing {{synthetic}} diamond is {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD). The growth occurs under low pressure (below atmospheric pressure). It involves feeding a mixture of gases (typically 1 to 99 methane to hydrogen) into a chamber and splitting them to chemically active radicals in a plasma <b>ignited</b> by microwaves, hot filament, arc discharge, welding torch or laser. This method is mostly used for coatings, but can also produce single crystals several millimeters in size (see picture).|$|E
50|$|TEAL <b>ignites</b> on {{contact with}} air and will <b>ignite</b> and/or {{decompose}} on contact with water, and {{with any other}} oxidizer. TEA {{is one of the}} few substances pyrophoric enough to <b>ignite</b> on contact with cryogenic liquid oxygen. Its easy ignition makes it particularly desirable as a rocket engine ignitor. The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket uses a triethylaluminium-triethylborane mixture as a first-stage ignitor.|$|R
5000|$|... "Hydrogen-air {{mixtures}} can <b>ignite</b> {{with very}} low energy input, 1/10 that required <b>igniting</b> a gasoline-air mixture. For reference, an invisible spark or a static spark {{from a person}} can cause ignition." ...|$|R
25|$|When the {{electrostatic}} discharge energy is high enough, it can <b>ignite</b> a fuel vapor and air mixture. Different fuels have different flammable limits and require {{different levels of}} {{electrostatic discharge}} energy to <b>ignite.</b>|$|R
