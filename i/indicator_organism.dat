50|$|The common {{feature of}} all these routine {{screening}} procedures is that the primary analysis is for indicator organisms rather than the pathogens that might cause concern. Indicator organisms are bacteria such as non-specific coliforms, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa that are very commonly found in the human or animal gut and which, if detected, may suggest the presence of sewage. Indicator organisms are used because even {{when a person is}} infected with a more pathogenic bacteria, they will still be excreting many millions times more indicator organisms than pathogens. It is therefore reasonable to surmise that if <b>indicator</b> <b>organism</b> levels are low, then pathogen levels will be very much lower or absent. Judgements as to suitability of water for use are based on very extensive precedents and relate to the probability of any sample population of bacteria being able to be infective at a reasonable statistical level of confidence.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} fecal <b>indicator</b> <b>organism,</b> Bacteroides, {{has been}} suggested because they make up {{a significant portion of}} the fecal bacterial population, have a high degree of host specificity that reflects differences in the digestive system of the host animal, and have a small potential to grow in the environment. Over the past decade, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods have been used to detect the presence of various microbial pathogens through the amplification of specific DNA sequences without culturing bacteria. One study has measured the amount of Bacteroides by using qPCR to quantify the host-specific 16S rRNA genetic marker. This technique allows quantification of genetic markers that are specific to the host of the bacteria and allow detection of recent contamination. A recent report found temperature plays a major role in the amount of time the bacteria will persist in the environment, the life span increases with colder temperatures (0-4 °C).|$|E

30|$|Currently, {{public health}} officials/scientists rely on {{exposure}} limits for assessing pathogen levels in water resources, {{which have been}} established to protect human health. The EPA defines acceptable recreational limits as those {{that will result in}} eight or fewer swimming-related gastrointestinal (GI) illnesses out of every 1, 000 swimmers (U.S. EPA [1986]). The current U.S. EPA fresh water quality criteria for E. coli is a geometric mean not exceeding 126  CFU/ 100  ml, or no samples exceeding a single sample maximum of 235  CFU/ 100  ml (U.S. EPA [2001]). Criteria were developed based on the U.S. EPA measurements of total and Highly Credible Gastrointestinal Illnesses (HCGI), which correlated with E. coli densities (r[*]=[*] 0.804) in fresh recreational waters (Dufour [1984]). Multiple studies have identified trends between <b>indicator</b> <b>organisms</b> in water and GI illness in humans, including vomiting, diarrhea, and fever (Cabelli [1983]; Wade et al. [2006]). Recent work by Edge et al. ([2010]) detected water-borne E. coli in 80 % of water samples with E. coli levels of less than 100  CFU/ 100  ml. Another study by Wade et al. ([2006]) reported significant positive trends between increased GI illness and <b>indicator</b> <b>organisms</b> at the Lake Michigan beach, and a positive trend with indicators such as E. coli at a Lake Erie beach.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Food Science, Washington State UniversityUnderstanding {{pathogen}} {{prevalence and}} transmission in agricultural environments {{is critical to}} enhance produce safety. An organic farming system (two compost types, irrigation water body, soil and crops) was assessed for presence of E. coli O 157 and Salmonella spp. and <b>indicator</b> <b>organism</b> levels (generic E. coli, total and fecal coliforms). Response to heat and starvation was evaluated for ATCC E. coli O 157 :H 7 strains (700599 and 43895) and seven environmental E. coli O 157 :H 7 isolates. Salmonella spp. (24), E. coli O 157 :H 7 (33) and E. coli O 157 (two H-, one H+, four H, eight H 12 and five H 42) were detected in samples collected at various points in the farming system. For both aerated static pile and turned pile compost {{in at least one}} year of the study, E. coli O 157 :H 7 was detected after meeting the time and temperature requirements for the process to further reduce pathogens; however pathogens were not detected during field application. Indicator organisms during turned pile composting tended to increase during turning for the first three turns; <b>indicator</b> <b>organism</b> trends for aerated static pile compost varied between years. Pasture plots with no recent soil amendments yielded more E. coli O 157 and Salmonella positive soil samples (12 / 112) compared to vegetable plots where composts were annually applied (6 / 112). There were no significant (p > 0. 05) differences observed in mean <b>indicator</b> <b>organism</b> levels between the pasture and vegetable plots. For irrigation water, sampling date and location significantly influenced <b>indicator</b> <b>organism</b> levels. E. coli O 157 and Salmonella were detected in irrigation water samples that met the Washington State Department of Ecology and Leafy Green Marketing Agreement water quality criteria. Type of soil amendment did not affect <b>indicator</b> <b>organism</b> levels on crops, but harvest date within year significantly influenced <b>indicator</b> <b>organism</b> levels on lettuce.

Environmental E. coli O 157 :H 7 isolates and ATCC strains responded similarly to heat and starvation stress conditions in laboratory experiments.

(CH 3) 2 SnCl 2 and (CH 3) 3 SnCl decreased viable counts at about 10 to 100 mg of Sn liter- 1 (8. 4 X 10 (- 5) to 8. 4 X 10 (- 4) mol of Sn liter- 1), and tributyltin chloride was effective at about 0. 1 to 1. 0 mg of Sn liter- 1 (8. 4 X 10 (- 7) to 8. 4 X 10 (- 6) mol of Sn liter- 1. These concentrations, particularly for the methyltin compounds, are greater than the concentrations reported to date for these compounds in aquatic ecosystems.
