40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is the {{comparative}} evaluation {{of the influence of}} physiologically active substances (PAS) on the ratio of morphogenesis types in vitro and plant regeneration in callus tissues of maize inbreds of the Lancaster heterotic group. Lancaster inbreds of Ukrainian selection DК 267, DК 6080 and DК 298 and lines PLS 61, A 188 and Chi 31 of foreign selection which represented eponymous heterotic groups were selected for into the research. For callusogenesis induction immature embryos of 1. 0 – 1. 5 mm in length were planted on a modified N 6 medium with 30 g/l sucrose. For regeneration the 30 -day callus tissue was transplanted to a modified MS medium containing 20 g/l sucrose and various PAS: 6 -benzylaminopurine (BAP) (0. 1 mg/l) or <b>indolylbutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (IBA) (1. 0 mg/l), or cefotaxime (CT) (150  mg/l). Morphogenesis and plant regeneration were obtained in callus tissue by organogenesis through the formation of leaf-like structures or shoots only without roots (hemmogenesis) and by embryogenesis through the development of embryos with the cooperative laying of the apexes of the shoot and the root. The predominant type of in vitro morphogenesis in both groups of genotypes was organogenesis. A tendency to increasing the embryogenesis level among Lancaster inbreds in comparison with the other investigated groups was observed. A certain tendency to increase the level of embryogenesis on a medium for regeneration with IBA, compared to other PAS, was marked. So, for the Lancaster group the embryogenesis level on the medium with IBA was 33. 3 %, while for the other investigated genotypes it was about 10. 3 %. Regeneration frequency was 45. 8 plantlets/ 100 calli for Lancaster inbred DК 298, 42. 2  plantlets/ 100 calli for DК 267 and 5. 6 plantlets/ 100 calli for DК 6080. Regeneration frequency of inbred PLS 61 was 204. 0 plantlets/ 100  calli, 100. 0 plantlets/ 100 calli for Chi 31 and 11. 1 plantlets/ 100 calli for А 188. Observed reductions in capacityfor plant regeneration of Lancaster inbreds may have been due to their pedigree. These inbreds belong to the commercial heterotic group that was not specially selected for increased regenerative ability, unlike the model inbreds of other heterotic groups. Overall, the level of regeneration frequency in the Lancaster group was 44. 8  plantlets/ 100 calli on the medium under BAP, 41. 4 plantlets/ 100 calli under IBA, and 20. 7 plantlets/ 100 calli with CT. In general, the level of regeneration frequency for non-Lancaster heterotic groups reached 89. 7 plantlets/ 100 calli on the medium with BAP, 96. 7  plantlets/ 100 calli under IBA, and 93. 1 plantlets/ 100 calli under CT. To enhance embryogenesis and frequency of regeneration for maize inbreds of the Lancaster group 30 g/l sucrose in the callusogenesis medium and physiologically active substance <b>indolylbutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (1. 0 mg/l) in the medium for regeneration can be recommended...|$|E
40|$|Tissue {{cultures}} {{were established}} from newly expanded leaves and axillary buds of rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis Muell. Arg.). Calli formed from these explants, but no regeneration occurred. Shoots {{were obtained from}} axillary buds cultured on Murashige and Skoog's (MS) medium (Physiol. Plant. 15 : 473 - 497, 1962) supplemented with 1. 0 mg/l kinetin, 1. 0 mg/l 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D), 20 g/l sucrose and 4 g/l Difco agar. Formation of a root similar to a tap root was induced on MS medium supplemented with 5. 0 mg/l naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), 3. 0 mg/l <b>indolylbutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (IBA), 50 g/l sucrose and 4 g/l Difco agar. Several types of explants were used in attempts to recover complete rubber tree plants with well-developed tap roots. Leaf explants and axillary buds formed calli on MS basic medium with different combinations of kinetin, benzylaminopurine (BAP), 2, 4 -D, IBA, NAA and indolylacetic acid (IAA). The antibiotic tetracycline was also used to control possible bacterial infections. However, no antibiotic effect was noted. Calli formation was abundant, but no regeneration was observed when the calli from different media was transferred to MS medium without growth hormones. On this basic medium, callus cultures became necrotic and died. Shoots developed from axillary buds, rooted vigorously when cultured on MS medium with NAA, IAA, and IBA. Based on these results, further studies with commercially important clones should lead to a feasible micropropagation technique. Culturas de tecidos in vitro foram estabelecidas de folhas recém-expandidas e de gemas axilares de seringueira (Hevea brasiliensis Muell. Arg.). Houve formação de calos nestes explantes mas a regeneração destes calos em embrióides não ocorreu. Brotos foram obtidos de gemas axilares cultivadas no meio de cultura básico de MS (Murashige and Skoog (Physiol. Plant. 15 : 473 - 497, 1962)), suplementado com 1, 0 mg/l de cinetina, 1, 0 mg/l de ácido 2, 4 -diclorofenoxiacético (2, 4 -D), 20 g/l de sacarose e 4 g/l de ágar Difco. Para o desenvolvimento do sistema radicular com raiz pivotante o meio de cultura usado foi o MS, suplementado com 5, 0 mg/l de ácido naftalenoacético (NAA); 3, 0 mg/l de ácido indolilbutírico (IBA); 50 g/l sacarose e 4, 0 g/l ágar Difco...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi estimar os parâmetros da análise de crescimento em função de diferentes reguladores vegetais aplicados na parte aérea de plantas de Salvia officinalis L. Para tanto,o experimento foi instalado em casa de vegetação do Departamento de Botânica, Instituto de Biociências, da Universidade Estadual Paulista, Botucatu, SP. Os tratamentos consistiram na pulverização da solução de 100 mg L- 1 de ácido giberélico (GA 3); 100 mg L- 1 de benzilaminopurina (BAP); 100 mg L- 1 de ácido 2 -cloroetil-fosfônico (ethephon); Stimulate® a 2 % (90 mg L- 1 de cinetina, 50 mg L- 1 de ácido giberélico e 50 mg L- 1 de ácido indolilbutírico) e água (testemunha). As aplicações foram {{realizadas}} em três épocas, aos 15, 25 e 35 dias após o transplante (d. a. t.) e o crescimento foi avaliado em cinco épocas de coletas a intervalos de 21 dias, sendo a primeira realizada aos 47 (d. a. t.). Foram determinados os parâmetros fisiológicos da análise de crescimento: razão de área foliar (RAF), área foliar específica (AFE), taxa assimilatória líquida (TAL) e taxa de crescimento relativo (TCR). Os resultados mostram que os reguladores de crescimento vegetal influenciaram os parâmetros fisiológicos da análise de crescimento. As plantas tratadas com BAP apresentaram maiores valores de RAF aos 47 d. a. t., já as plantas tratadas com GA 3, a TAL apresentou aumento até o 131 d. a. t. A TCR é decrescente para todos os tratamentos com reguladores de crescimento vegetal testados e a testemunha. The {{objective of}} this study was to estimate the effects of different plant regulators on the index growth analysis application of sage plants. An experiment was conducted in a greenhouse with controlled temperature and relative humidity, at the Departmento de Botânica, Instituto de Biociências, Universidade Estadual Paulista, UNESP, Botucatu, SP, Brazil. The experimental design was completely randomized, with five treatments containing three replicates. Treatments consisted of the spraying of the solution of 100 mg L- 1 of gibberellic acid (GA 3); 100 mg L- 1 of benzylaminopurine (BAP); 100 mg L- 1 of 2 -chloroethyl phosphonic acid (ethephon); Stimulate® at 2 % (90 mg L- 1 of kinetin, 50 mg L- 1 of gibberellic acid and 50 mg L- 1 of <b>indolylbutyric</b> <b>acid)</b> and water (control). Applications of plant growth regulators were performed in 3 times, at 15, 25, and 35 days after transplanting, and growth was evaluated in five successive harvests at 21 -day intervals, performed at 47, 68, 89, 110, and 131 days after transplanting. The following growth index were determined: leaf area ratio (LAR), specific leaf area (SLA), net assimilation rate (NAR), and relative growth rate (RGR). These results suggest that the plant growth regulators influence the index growth analysis. The plants treated with BAP presented increase values of LAR to the 47 days after transplanting. The plants treated with GA 3 to NAR presented increase until the 131 days after transplanting. The RGR is decreasing for all the treatments with vegetal regulators tested and the control...|$|E
