5|$|On {{the evening}} of September 11, 1957, {{plutonium}} shavings in a glove box located in building 771 (the Plutonium Recovery and Fabrication Facility) spontaneously ignited. The fire spread to the flammable glove box materials, including plexiglas windows and rubber gloves. The fire rapidly spread through the interconnected glove boxes and ignited the large bank of High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters located in a plenum downstream. Within minutes the first filters had burned out, allowing plutonium particles {{to escape from the}} building exhaust stacks. The building exhaust fans stopped operating due to fire damage at 10:40 PM, which ended the majority of the plutonium release. Fire fighters initially used carbon dioxide fire extinguishers because water can act as a moderator and cause plutonium to go critical. They resorted to water hoses when the <b>dry</b> <b>fire</b> extinguishers proved ineffective.|$|E

50|$|In recent years, {{a number}} of {{companies}} have developed methods of enhancing <b>dry</b> <b>fire</b> practice to improve skills. Products that fire a laser, as opposed to a solid projectile, have become increasingly popular. These include chamber inserts available for various caliber firearms, as well as dedicated training pistols or replacement AR-15 bolt carrier groups. There are also {{a number of}} target systems for these laser <b>dry</b> <b>fire</b> training aides, that are becoming more affordable and popular. These products help people get more from <b>dry</b> <b>fire</b> practice by providing feedback on shot placement and times, and make <b>dry</b> <b>fire</b> a more enjoyable experience.|$|E

50|$|Even with {{a release}} aid {{mechanism}} {{some of this}} effect is usually experienced, since the string always accelerates faster than the retaining part of the mechanism. This makes the arrow oscillate in flight—its center flexing {{to one side and}} then the other repeatedly, gradually reducing as the arrow's flight proceeds. This is clearly visible in high-speed photography of arrows at discharge. A direct effect of these energy transfers can clearly be seen when <b>dry</b> <b>firing.</b> <b>Dry</b> <b>firing</b> refers to releasing the bow string without a nocked arrow. Because there is no arrow to receive the stored potential energy, almost all the energy stays in the bow. Some have suggested that <b>dry</b> <b>firing</b> may cause physical damage to the bow, such as cracks and fractures—and because most bows are not specifically made to handle the high amounts of energy <b>dry</b> <b>firing</b> produces, should never be done.|$|R

50|$|It is {{generally}} acceptable to <b>dry</b> <b>fire</b> more modern centerfire firearms without a cartridge or snap cap. Older designs {{such as the}} CZ 52 and Colt Single Action Army are exceptions. However, dry firing a rimfire firearm, striker based firearms or guns with angled firing pins (such as revolvers with hammer-mounted firing pins or older shotguns) can damage the gun. Furthermore, damage can occur to the chamber mouth of a rimfire firearm. Ultimately, one should check with the manufacturer of the gun to ascertain if {{it is safe to}} <b>dry</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Dry firing in archery {{refers to}} the loosing of the string of a bow or other weapon without ammunition, which should never be done. Without the arrow to absorb the energy, the energy is instead {{dissipated}} through vibration of the string, limbs, etc. Compound bows are particularly susceptible to damage due to high tension and numerous moving parts. Dry firing a modern high-poundage compound bow even once may cause a combination of cracked limbs, bent axles, string derailment, cam warpage, string/cable failure, cable slide failure, etc. It can even cause the bow to shatter. While some bows can survive a <b>dry</b> <b>fire</b> with no apparent damage, typically manufacturers do not warrant their bows for dry firing, and any bow that has been dry fired needs to be thoroughly inspected for damage before shooting again. In particular, the limbs need to be inspected for cracking around cam axles {{and the opening of}} the slot where the cams or pulleys fit in (since they tend to tilt sideways during a <b>dry</b> <b>fire).</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>firing</b> is the {{practice}} of [...] "firing" [...] a firearm without ammunition. That is, {{to pull the trigger}} and allow the hammer or striker to drop on an empty chamber. <b>Dry</b> <b>firing</b> may be mechanically damaging to some firearms - especially rimfire weapons, where the firing pin in most designs will impact the breech face if the weapon is dry-fired. Because of this, precautions (such as the use of snap caps) need to be taken if such a weapon is to be deliberately dry-fired.|$|R
50|$|The SR9 boasts {{multiple}} {{safety devices}} such an ambidextrous manual thumb safety and magazine release, a loaded chamber indicator, a visual and tactile cocked-striker indicator, and a firing pin block safety which prevents the pistol from firing {{if it is}} accidentally dropped. The SR9 also features a magazine disconnector.The Ruger SR9 can safely be <b>dry</b> <b>fired</b> with an empty magazine in the pistol. A Ruger-issued warning states that, due to the disconnector, <b>dry</b> <b>firing</b> the pistol without the magazine inserted will cause unnecessary wear to the striker block, but published firearms industry information notes that the SR9's disconnect can be deactivated simply by removing some of the disconnector linkage.|$|R
50|$|The first {{advantage}} {{of using a}} release aid is the drastic decrease in chance of <b>dry</b> <b>firing</b> a compound bow. Doing this {{runs the risk of}} damaging the bow, and can result in the injury of the user.|$|R
5000|$|The {{preceding}} summer {{had been}} unusually hot and <b>dry.</b> <b>Fire</b> rangers, anticipating the upcoming [...] "burn" [...] season, had requested {{to stay in}} the area but were not granted permission. They left {{at the end of the}} fire season in mid September, leaving the area without fire protection services. In the fall when burning permits were no longer required, farmers and settlers started to set small brush fires to clear the land. Dry conditions had persisted past the usual [...] "burn" [...] season and on October 4, the wind turned into hurricane-force gales, fanning the flames out of control and combining the brush fires into one large inferno.|$|E
50|$|The bore is the {{interior}} {{diameter of the}} barrel. The bore must properly match the type of paint being fired, the most critical aspect of a barrel. A mismatched selection will result in velocity variations, which causes difficulty in maintaining a close match to field velocity limits and in extreme cases it can affect accuracy. Two and three-piece barrels let the barrel bore be matched to the paint diameter without needing new barrels. Correct matching is especially important in closed-bolt markers that lack ball detents because the ball will roll down, and potentially out of, the barrel. This results in either a <b>dry</b> <b>fire</b> {{in the event that}} the ball fell out of the barrel, or a lower velocity shot.|$|E
50|$|When Savage Arms {{purchased}} Stevens in 1920, the Model 520 was updated incorporating several {{design changes}} that were emerging prior to 1916. These include a relocated slide release button, {{moved from the}} left side of the receiver to {{the left side of the}} trigger plate, and a redesigned inertial slide release, incorporated into the design of the trigger plate.In 1925 the Model 520 first appeared as a store branded gun when it is sold as the Ranger Repeater Model 30 by Sears and the Western Field Model 30 by Montgomery Wards. Around this time the inertial slide release blocks are removed and replaced with a spring that provided forward pressure on the slide release. Guns made after this time could be unlocked after a <b>dry</b> <b>fire</b> with forward pressure on the slide.|$|E
50|$|A feature {{inherent}} to the M1903 and not {{found on the}} Mauser 98 is the conspicuous knob {{at the rear of}} the bolt, allowing the rifle's trigger tension to be released without <b>dry</b> <b>firing</b> and damaging the firing pin.|$|R
40|$|Temperatures that {{significantly}} increase seed germination of some tropical legumes (i. e. 80 - 100 °C) were {{documented in the}} topsoil during the passage of early (May) and late (October) <b>dry</b> season <b>fires</b> in a tropical eucalypt savanna of north-eastern Australia. Elevated temperatures penetrated at least 30 mm into the soil during the higher-intensity, late <b>dry</b> season <b>fires,</b> but were only detected at 10 mm during the early <b>dry</b> season <b>fires.</b> The depth from which germination of two native legume forbs Galactia tenuiflora and Indigofera hirsuta occurred {{was positively related to}} the temperature elevation in the topsoil and was greater after late compared with early <b>dry</b> season <b>fires.</b> A broader range in germination depth, resulting in higher seedling densities, was recorded for I hirsuta after late <b>dry</b> season <b>fires.</b> These results suggest that seedling emergence of native leguminous forbs is likely to occur at a greater density after late rather than early <b>dry</b> season <b>fires</b> in tropical eucalypt savannas of north-eastern Australia. Therefore, the season of burning, {{as a result of its}} relationship to fire intensity, can influence species composition through its effect on seed germination...|$|R

50|$|The bolts are {{designed}} {{to have the same}} diameter as the air rifle pellet (.177) and Small bore caliber rifle cartridge (.22). The end of the bolt is a screw with a blunt end, with the screw swirling pattern helping the shooter to extract the bolt easily by unscrewing the bolt from the target board. To load the bolt, a lever is used. The lever can either be a separate item, or is a built-in mechanism of the crossbow. Match crossbow is not hand drawn. Since the early 1980s the match crossbow commonly use an electronic trigger that can provide <b>dry</b> <b>fire</b> mechanism, along with an electronic lighted level. The entire stock of the match crossbow is similar, if not the same, as an Olympic air rifle or small bore rifle, which is usually made of laminated wood stock.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike {{the eternal}} and unchanging {{celestial}} aether, {{each of the}} four terrestrial elements are capable of changing into either of the two elements they share a property with: e.g. the cold and wet (water) can transform into the hot and wet (air) or the cold and dry (earth) and any apparent change into the hot and <b>dry</b> (<b>fire)</b> is actually a two-step process. These properties are predicated of an actual substance relative to the work it is able to do; that of heating or chilling and of desiccating or moistening. The four elements exist only with regard to this capacity and relative to some potential work. The celestial element is eternal and unchanging, so only the four terrestrial elements account for [...] "coming to be" [...] and [...] "passing away"or, in the terms of Aristotle's De Generatione et Corruptione (Περὶ γενέσεως καὶ φθορᾶς), [...] "generation" [...] and [...] "corruption".|$|E
40|$|AbstractSome of the {{shooting}} training that biathletes implements takes place indoors, even in hotel rooms or at home, through so-called “dry firing” training. It involves imitating shooting at a target with real rifle but without ammunition, when the result is evaluated by various electronic devices {{counting the number of}} virtual hits. But <b>dry</b> <b>firing</b> cannot adequately represent real shooting, as it does not produce any rifle recoil, which significantly limits its value for the training. To reach a higher realism of the <b>dry</b> <b>firing</b> training a system mimicking the weapon recoil is therefore needed. Present research aims to overcome an existing lack of data on the dynamics of small caliber rifles recoil dynamics. Present paper describes first measurement results acquired in the controlled environment of {{the shooting}} range. Two types of experiments were carried out with firing freely suspended rifle and when backed with the force measurement device (load cell). Average recoil peak force values were reaching 5 kg, rising from zero for about 10 - 15 ms and keeping altogether for about 30 - 40 ms. Corresponding energy going into the recoil motion of the rifle is found to be about 390 J. The measured values provide an adequate input for designing the devices mimicking the biathlon weapon recoil in <b>dry</b> <b>firing</b> training...|$|R

50|$|In addition, wise {{students}} of quick-draw for combat shooting seldom practice drawing and firing a loaded double-action revolver or automatic at top speed. They draw and <b>dry</b> <b>fire</b> an empty gun at top speed, but draw and shoot a loaded gun at a significantly slower speed. On the few occasions when an experienced shooter does practice a maximum-speed quick-draw with a revolver, he generally loads five {{rounds of ammunition}} into the six-shot cylinder, so {{that the first time}} he pulls the trigger, the hammer will fall on an empty chamber. If he screws up the draw, the sound of the hammer falling on the empty chamber while the gun is still in the holster will generally be enough to stop him from pulling the trigger again, firing a loaded cartridge into his leg the second time. And the wise practitioner uses a firmly anchored quick-draw-holster, which will release the gun very easily, whether it be a belt holster or a concealment rig.|$|E
5000|$|One {{disadvantage}} {{of the magazine}} disconnect {{is that it may}} add tension to components of the trigger mechanism, making the trigger pull uneven or heavy. A safety argument against a magazine disconnect is that if a round is left in a chamber due to extractor failure or other reason the firearm will revert to being live unexpectedly when an empty magazine is reinserted. This is a danger because the user may <b>dry</b> <b>fire</b> the gun during or after the unloading process. With a magazine disconnect depressing the trigger into a bullet trap or other safe direction, such as downrange, will not clear the round in the chamber because the trigger is disabled. When an empty magazine is inserted the firing system becomes reactivated, even though the trigger has been previously depressed. The Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute stated that an [...] "obvious concern with magazine disconnect features is that determining whether the gun is safe becomes linked to the presence of the magazine as opposed to actually checking the gun, opening the action, and making sure it is unloaded." ...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. The Navy small arms training and qualification instruction focused on <b>dry</b> <b>fire</b> and simulators should be utilized when available. However, naval personnel {{often do not}} have access to <b>dry</b> <b>fire</b> training opportunities and therefore may be at risk for losing perishable marksmanship skills. The purpose of the study was to determine if the use of a simulator is at least as effective in marksmanship training as traditional <b>dry</b> <b>fire</b> techniques. A between-groups study with a random selection of volunteers (blocked by previous marksmanship experience) was conducted to determine if participants who completed simulation-based training showed greater improvement and retention of marksmanship skills than participants completing <b>dry</b> <b>fire</b> training. The main measures were the qualification scores, average shot group size, shot group size and mean point of impact to center zeroing point length. The experiment utilized a simulated M 9 Berretta for the qualification. Results demonstrate that simulation training improved performance on the seven-yard line to a greater extent than current naval training. Exploratory analyses suggest that simulation training may be most beneficial for less-experienced shooters, and that a minimum of two weeks' time is needed to detect group differences in the retention of skills.
