40|$|A {{research}} entitled “Performance of Growing Male Quails Under Different Complete Feeds and Floor Sorts” {{has been}} conducted in experimental farm, Faculty of Animal Husbandry Unsoed  Purwokerto.   The objective {{of the study is}} to find out the best floor sort and complete <b>feed</b> <b>for</b> <b>performance</b> of growing male quails. One hundred and fifty male quails at three weeks old were used in this study. Split Plot Design were used in this research. Floor sorts  were used as  maintreatments and they consists of L 1 (litter floor) and L 2 (wire floor) Complete feeds were used as subtreatment and they consists of  P 1 (AD 51), P 2 (CP 511), P 3 (B 11) and P 4 (BR 1). Deck levels were used as deck  andT 1 (high), T 2 (meden) and T 3 (low deck). Statistical analyses showed that complete feeds had significant effect (P< 0. 05) on feed consumption but not significant on body weight, growth and feed conversion. Floor sorts and their interaction  with the complete feeds  had not significant on the performance of the birds. It can be conclused that during growing period, P 1 (AD 51) gave better <b>performance</b> and <b>for</b> floor shorts, either litter or wire can be used to growing male quails.

40|$|Abstract- Cognitive Radio Network opportunistically {{exploits}} locally unused spectrum {{which is}} not heavily occupied by licensed users. It provides a new path to resolve spectral scarcity and to avoid spectral congestion, without disturbing the QoS requirements {{of others in the}} system. Of the many challenges involved in the practical ways of framing concepts for a working model of CR Network, we present its results for predominant applications of data and video, in detail. This project addresses the most plausible method of integrating a full scale CR Network capable of using TCP connections, video and data traffic. By providing higher priority status for video traffic over data traffic <b>feeds,</b> simulations <b>for</b> <b>performance</b> analysis are shown with the help of Dynamic Vertical Sharing Overlay methodology. The theoretical values of mean delay and jitter for data and TCP packets may be computed along with an analysis of the average throughput and efficiency of the system for different TCP based connections. Further simulation with higher priority video signal and data traffic will be considered. A comparative analysis of results over data and video signal will be carried out...|$|R
40|$|At present, {{there is}} no clear {{consensus}} as to whether protein feeding harnesses any ergogenic benefit for endurance athletes. In this thesis demonstrate no effect of protein on endurance performance. Furthermore, data presented herein indicates that protein co-ingestion does not enhance recovery 24 hours after exercise. Consequently, there is currently no basis on which to recommend protein <b>feeding</b> <b>for</b> endurance <b>performance</b> and recovery. Nutrient strategies implemented after exercise can markedly alter the acute response of muscle protein synthesis and, potentially, long-term phenotypic adaptation. Protein nutrition has traditionally been considered in the context of resistance exercise. Endurance exercise followed by protein ingestion increases the synthesis of mixed muscle protein via increased mRNA translation. Herein, we demonstrate that protein feeding after endurance exercise elevates the synthetic rate of contractile proteins and specific mRNA signalling intermediates. Insulin resistance that precedes Type II diabetes is characterized by blunted sensitivity of the pancreas to glucose and impaired glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. Lifestyle interventions including nutrient and exercise have the potential to improve glycemic control. The final experimental chapter in this thesis provides mechanistic evidence to support the benefits of resistance exercise for lowering post-prandial glucose concentrations. Interestingly, protein ingestion did not augment the glucose-lowering effects of prior resistance exercise. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Tungsten carbide-cobalt (WC-Co) {{composite}} is a difficult-to-machine material {{owing to}} its excellent strength and hardness at elevated temperature. Wire {{electrical discharge machining}} (WEDM) is a best alternative for machining of WC-Co composite into intricate and complex shapes. Efficient machining of WC-Co composite on WEDM is a challenging task since it involves large numbers of parameters. Therefore, in present work, experimental investigation {{has been carried out}} to determine the influence of important WEDM parameters on machining performance of WC-Co composite. Response surface methodology, which is a collection of mathematical and experimental techniques, was utilised to obtain the experimental data. Using face-centered central composite design, experiments were conducted to investigate and correlate the four input parameters: pulse-on time, pulse-off time, servo voltage and wire <b>feed</b> <b>for</b> three output <b>performance</b> characteristics &ndash; cutting speed (CS), surface roughness (SR) and radial overcut (RoC). Using analysis of variance on experimental data, quadratic vs. two-factor interaction (2 FI) models have been suggested for CS and RoC while two-factor interaction (2 FI) has been proposed for SR. Using these mathematical models, optimal parameters can be determined easily <b>for</b> desired <b>performance</b> characteristics, and hence a trade-off can be made among different performance characteristics...|$|R

Preliminary obser-vations indicate a high coexistence {{of these species}} in terms of host-plant use; in addition, {{there is a strong}} similarity regarding egg and nymph morphology. In this study, the most suitable <b>feeding</b> sites <b>for</b> nymph <b>performance</b> on wild (Passiflora suberosa Linnaeus and Passiflora misera Humbold, Bonpland et Kunth) and cultivated (Passiflora edulis Sims) hosts were determined by rearing them on each host and on the combination of hosts.

For both species, P. suberosa was the most suitable host plant. First instar nymphs of both species fed on terminal buds more frequently when compared to other plant parts. Second instar nymphs switched to green fruits, whose behavior was more pronounced for H. clavigera. Thus, H. clavigera and A. foliacea marginella immatures are extremely similar in terms of host-plant use and consequences <b>for</b> <b>performance,</b> in addition to their morphological similarity.

The {{study was conducted to}} enhance lysine production from a local strain of Corynebacterium glutamicum. The bacterium was mutated by exposure to UV. Mutants resistant to s- 2 -aminoethyle L-cystein (AEC) and showing auxotrophy for L-homoserine were screened for lysine production qualitatively and quantitatively. A mutant showing highest production of lysine (8. 2 mg/mL) was selected for optimization of physical and nutritional parameters for maximum production of lysine in shake flask. An initial pH 7. 6, 30 ˚C temperature, 300 rpm and 60 h incubation time were the optimized values of physical requirements. Cane molasses and corn starch hydrolysate were required at 15 % (w/v) in the fermentation media which provided around 9 % total sugars to produce maximum lysine (17 to 18 mg/mL). When amonium sulphate was used at 3. 5 % (w/v) level in molasses or corn starch hydrolysate based fermentation media, production of lysine slightly increased above 18 mg/mL. It is concluded that industrial by products like cane molasses, corn steep liquor, and corn starch hydrolysate can be used as carbon and organic nitrogen sources in fermentation medium for scale up process of lysine production and this lysine enriched broth may be used in broiler feed later. However, more potent lysine producing mutant and additional in vivo trials would be required to commercialize this product...|$|R

Result shows that temperature, pH of BSA feed solution, flow rate and operation pressure can affect the flux and rejection coefficient of membrane. High temperature feed solution tend to decrease the flux but increase rejection coefficient. Rejection coefficient of membrane will increase while flux decreasing at pH of feed solution near to protein isoelectric point. High pressure of feed solution will increase flux but decrease rejection of membrane. Rejection of membrane will decrease and flux will increase when the process operated in slow flow rate...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT A {{total of}} 360 one-day-old Cobb 500 chicks were {{randomly}} distributed {{in a completely}} randomized design according to a 3 × 2 factorial arrangement, consisting of three levels of dietary crude protein (100, 90 and 85 % of NRCrecommended levels) and a feed additive (with or without feed additive). A blend of a commercial probiotic and a prebiotic were used as feed additives. Each treatment had four replicates of 15 birds each. Prebiotic and probiotic {{were added to the}} starter (days 1 to 21) and finisher (days 22 to 42) diets according to the manufacturer´s recommendations. The findings indicated that significant differences were not observed between 100 and 90 % NRC <b>for</b> broiler <b>performance</b> (body weight, body weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion ratio) throughout the experiment, while the birds fed the diets containing 85 % NRC had poorer performance than those fed 100 % (p< 0. 05). Feed additives had no significant effect on broilers performance. There was no significant interaction between protein level and <b>feed</b> additive <b>for</b> <b>performance.</b> Dietary inclusion of feed additives had no significant effect on cecal lactobacillus and Escherichia coli counts at 21 days of age, while, at 42 days of age, feed additive increased lactobacillus and decreased the counts of Escherichia coli (p< 0. 05). In conclusion, according to the findings of the current experiment, dietary crude protein could be reduced by 10 %, without negative effect on broiler performance. Supplementation with feed additives had no significant effect on broiler performance, but beneficially influenced cecal bacteria counts at 42 days of age...|$|R

40|$|<b>Feeding</b> {{strategies}} <b>for</b> <b>performance</b> horses using mainly high starch diets, {{can result}} in enhanced susceptibility to colic or laminitis (Kronfeld and Harris, 1997). The incidence {{of which can be}} reduced through the use of beneficial microbial supplement that increase nutrient availability, modify gut microflora and enhance performance. One source is a live culture of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisae (Yea-Sacc® 1026; CBS 493. 94, Alltech Inc, USA). The addition of Saccharomyces cerevisiae limits the extent of undesirable changes in the intestinal ecosystem of the horse. It can improve the microbial balance in the hindgut of horses, stimulating the population of fibre digesting bacteria and their activity. Such yeast cultures have also been found to increase the digestibility of dietary nutrients, particularly ADF due to its positive effect on the number and activity of cellulolytic bacteria. In the case of high starch diets, where there may be a negative digestive interaction between starch and cellulose which can lead to digestive disorders, supplementation with yeast culture might limit the effect by rebalancing the complex microbial population of the hind gut yeast cultures. In improving fibre digestibility, supplementation with a yeast culture would increase nutrients supply, namely of energy and nitrogen to some extend and as a result the performance of horses: lactating mare, foals and yearling. In conclusion, increasing number of studies have shown that supplementation with a yeast culture significantly improves the digestibility of fibre within the diets and goes some way to counteracting the negative effects of diets containing high levels of starch. vo...|$|R
