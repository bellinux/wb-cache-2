[...] AllMusic's Matt Collar lauded Trainor's vocal ability as [...] "soulful" [...] and [...] "highly resonant" [...] on the record. Christina Garibaldi of MTV News {{felt that the}} title track showcased Trainor's [...] "impressive" [...] rapping skills. Stereogum's Chris DeVille wrote, [...] "Title suggests she might <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> outlasting 'All About That Bass' if only she finds some new subject matter to sing about." [...] DeVille, however, commended the EP's production, opining, [...] " [...] how to craft a hit, {{both in terms of}} punchy major-key music and cheeky, meme-able lyrical turns," [...] and went on to conclude that Trainor is a [...] "very capable singer" [...] and is able to [...] "project lots of character and emotion within a relatively limited range". In a mixed review, a writer for the Knoxville News Sentinel commented, [...] "After 'Bass,' Title loses its element of surprise and leaves even appreciative listeners to wonder what else Trainor's got to offer".|$|E

[...] Talia Kraines of BBC Online called the song [...] "very strange, but wonderful". In his consumer guide, Robert Christgau wrote, [...] "But me, I'm a hater, and thus I'm something like outraged, by not just those two pimp-outs but an 'Ave Maria' lacking even the dumbstruck literalism of Pink's rendition or the grotesque conversion of 'Umbrella' into 'Halo.'" [...] Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald wrote that the song was [...] "pompous and frankly embarrassing". Colin McGuire of PopMatters commented that [...] "Ave Maria" [...] is a [...] "pretty normal take, a piece that has simply been done too many times before to think [...] would even <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> putting her stamp on it." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian described the song as [...] "dreary". According to James Reed of The Boston Globe, the song is [...] "an intriguing proposition torpedoed by a soggy arrangement". Adam Mazmanian of The Washington Times gave a negative review for the song, writing that the high notes included [...] on [...] "Ave Maria", [...] "should have remained a secret between Beyonce and her producers". In 2013, John Boone and Jennifer Cady of E! Online placed the song at number ten on their list of ten best Knowles' songs.

On the March 12, 1998 episode of Thunder, Malenko defeated a wrestler wearing Juventud Guerrera's mask {{who appeared to be}} Jericho. However, the masked wrestler was actually Lenny Lane, who Jericho bribed to appear in the match. This started a minor feud between Lane and Jericho after Jericho refused to pay Lane. At Uncensored, Jericho finally wrestled Malenko and defeated him, after which Malenko took a leave of absence from wrestling. Jericho then proceeded to bring with him to the ring a portrait of Malenko that he insulted and demeaned. Just prior to Slamboree, J.J.

Jericho accepted on the grounds that whoever he faced would be too tired to win a second match. At Slamboree, Jericho came out to introduce the competitors in an insulting fashion before the match started and then went backstage for coffee. An individual who appeared to be Ciclope won the battle royal after Juventud Guerrera shook his hand and then eliminated himself. The winner was a returning Malenko in disguise.
