[...] As originally planned, he began his announcement day with a visit to the Naval Academy.|$|E
500|$|While reading Dickinson's book, English novelist Jackie Collins {{ran into}} the author at a bookstore and asked the fellow author to lunch to discuss their mutual experiences. Janice Dickinson landed a {{television}} role as a judge on the program America's Next Top Model due to No Lifeguard on Duty. Show creator Tyra Banks explained to The Boston Herald her decision process: [...] "The reason why I hired Janice Dickinson <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> read her book (No Lifeguard on Duty: The Accidental Life of the World's First Supermodel), and that book represented every single thing that I have never done. Every single thing that I have never experienced." ...|$|E
500|$|Along with The Dark Knight Returns, Tim Burton has {{mentioned}} that The Killing Joke influenced his film adaptation of Batman: [...] "I {{was never a}} giant comic book fan, but I've always loved the image of Batman and the Joker. The reason I've never been a comic book fan — and I think it started when I was a child — <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> could never tell which box I was supposed to read. I don't {{know if it was}} dyslexia or whatever, but that's why I loved The Killing Joke, because for the first time I could tell which one to read. It's my favorite. It's the first comic I've ever loved. And the success of those graphic novels made our ideas more acceptable." ...|$|E

500|$|And the Band Played On was {{critically}} acclaimed {{and became a}} best-seller. Judith Eannarino of the Library Journal called it [...] "one {{of the most important}} books of the year", upon its release. It made Shilts both a star and a pariah for his coverage of the disease and the bitter politics in the gay community. He described his motivation to undertake the writing of the book in an interview after its release, saying, [...] "Any good reporter could have done this story, but I think the reason I did it, and no one else did, <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> am gay. It was happening to people I cared about and loved." [...] The book was later adapted into an HBO film of the same name in 1993. Shilts was tested for HIV while he was writing the book; he died of complications from AIDS in 1994.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by George Meyer. It is one of The Simpsons creator Matt Groening's {{favorite}} episodes of the earlier seasons {{because he thought it}} took the show to another level. Meyer said he has a [...] "deep suspicion of social institutions and tradition in general," [...] which affected the way he wrote the episode. Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who had written for The Simpsons {{since the start of the}} show, took over as show runners for the third season. Their first episode as show runners was [...] "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" [...] and they felt a lot of pressure about running the show. Jean and Reiss were so pressured that they did six to seven rewrites of the script to make it funnier. Jean said [...] "one reason for doing all these rewrites <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> kept thinking 'It's not good enough. It's not good enough'," [...] and Reiss added that [...] "we were definitely scared. We had never run anything before, and they dumped us on this." ...|$|E
500|$|Bono {{wrote the}} lyric of the 1988 song [...] "All I Want Is You" [...] as a {{meditation}} {{on the idea of}} commitment. He later said, [...] "'s clearly about a younger version of myself and my relationship with Ali," [...] and added that by nature he was a wanderer, not a family man, and that [...] "The only reason I'm here <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> met someone so extraordinary that I just couldn't let that go." [...] U2 lyrics usually have several possible levels of interpretation, and it is not always possible to definitively ascribe Hewson's influence upon them, but music writer Niall Stokes believes that inspiration from Hewson is pronounced throughout the group's 1997 album Pop, particularly on [...] "Staring at the Sun", which he believes reflects her Chernobyl Children's Project involvement and the feelings of both danger and hopefulness that it triggered in Bono. Stokes also believes that the 2000 song [...] "When I Look at the World" [...] is an explicit acknowledgement of Hewson's strength and commitment as exemplified by that Chernobyl work, while others think it is about Jesus or God. Bono has seemed to deflect those interpretations, saying that song is in part a hard-edged look at himself from the eyes of one losing faith. In any case, Bono has said that he does not feel constrained in his writing or interviews by what Hewson might think, as [...] " [...] doesn't read newspapers. Or listen to the radio. There's a mysterious distance between us." [...] Not known for being musical herself, Hewson did perform Lady Gaga's [...] "Telephone", as a duet with her husband, to serenade their daughter Eve at her 21st birthday celebration at a club in Las Vegas in 2012.|$|E

Then it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> of an altercation with a nurse. Then I was told, it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> {{threatened}} a colleague."

2500|$|The Telegraph {{reported}} on December 20, that Mayweather said Pacquiao’s association with promoter Bob Arum {{is the reason}} why the bout will not happen. [...] "We all know the Pacquiao fight, at this particular time, will never happen, and the reason why the fight won't happen <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> will never do business with Bob Arum again in life, and Pacquiao is Bob Arum's fighter," [...] Mayweather said.|$|E

[...] I don't know why. Part of it <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> choose... no, I don't choose not to be. I want to be close to them. I kind of feel uncomfortable.

[...] Particularly in astronomy and physics, he said, the book inspired many people to become scientists. Sagan has also been called the [...] "most successful popularizing scientist of our time," [...] for his ability to draw such a large and varied audience.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, David Callaham pitched {{his take}} on Godzilla to Legendary and Warner Bros. and was hired to write the first draft. Speaking of his draft, Callaham stated, [...] "Godzilla is a pretty cut and dry, giant monster that smashes stuff. But the reason I got excited about it <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> saw themes and {{relationships}} to the modern world that I could tell in this story that was important." [...] Callaham did research on Godzilla's history, animal documentaries, as well as natural disasters and local government disaster plannings in order to depict the events {{as close as possible}} to real-life disasters.|$|E

They remain a mystery. I talked about this yesterday with a friend: do we focus on finding a person who fits with us, or will we remain single? I am open to both. If the right one comes – wonderful.

2500|$|In early 2003, Cousins {{injured his}} ankle {{in a game}} against Hawthorn but played on through five weeks of pain-killing injections. In Round 15, 2004, he injured his back and missed six games. Cousins said, [...] "That injury is {{something}} that I got over and am probably no chance of getting a relapse... The other side to it <b>is,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have played 10 years of consistent AFL footy, I've probably got an older back than someone my age". In Round 1, 2005, he dislocated a finger and missed one round after undergoing an operation. West Coast chief executive Trevor Nesbitt said, [...] "There's no doubt that he's at his best when under pressure and he's so resilient; he plays with injuries that other players wouldn't".|$|E
