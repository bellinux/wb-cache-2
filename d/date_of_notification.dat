5000|$|So-called [...] "centralised" [...] (European Medicines Agency / European Commission) MAs were {{introduced}} by Regulation 2309/93 and became available in January 1995 (i.e. some 2 {{years after the}} introduction of the original SPC legislation for medicinal products). The introduction of these authorisations added a new layer of complexity to the issue of determination of the date of a MA. This is because there are two dates associated with [...] "centralised" [...] authorisations, namely: (1) the date of the European Commission's decision to issue an authorisation; and (2) the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> of that decision to the MA applicant. Date (2) is usually a few days (e.g. 2 to 4 days) later than date (1). Although the standard practice of many national patent offices seems to be to calculate SPC term based upon date (1), an October 2011 article in Scrip Regulatory Affairs by Mike Snodin argues that this standard practice is incorrect and that date (2) should be used instead (with the result that some products may be entitled to a slightly longer SPC term than previously thought). Paramount amongst the reasons for preferring date (2) to date (1) is that a [...] "centralised" [...] authorisation does not become effective until it is notified to the MA applicant.|$|E
50|$|The PPV&FR Act, 2001 {{was enacted}} to grant {{intellectual}} property rights to plant breeders, researchers and farmers who have developed any new or extant plant varieties. The Intellectual Property Right granted under PPV&FR Act, 2001 is a dual right - one is for the variety {{and the other is}} for the denomination assigned to it by the breeder. The rights granted under this Act are heritable and assignable and only registration of a plant variety confers the right. Essentially Derived Varieties (EDV) can also be registered under this Act and it may be new or extant. Farmers are entitled to save, use, sow, re-sow, exchange or sell their farm produce including seed of a registered variety in an unbranded manner. Farmers' varieties are eligible for registration and farmers are totally exempted from payment of any fee in any proceedings under this Act. The period of protection for field crops is 15 years and for trees and vines is 18 years and for notified varieties it is 15 years from the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> under section 5 of Seeds Act, 1966. Annual fee has to be paid every year for maintaining the registration and renewal fee has to be paid for the extended period of registration. Farmers can claim for compensation if the registered variety fails to provide expected performance under given conditions. The rights granted under this Act are exclusive right to produce, sell, market, distribute, import and export the variety. Civil and criminal remedies are provided for enforcement of breeders' rights and provisions relating to benefit sharing and compulsory licence in case registered variety is not made available to the public at reasonable price are provided. Compensation is also provided for village or rural communities if any registered variety has been developed using any variety in whose evolution such village or local community has contributed significantly. The procedural details and modes of implementing this Act are provided in PPV&FR Rules, 2003. In the present article, we are discussing some of the important legal provisions of this Act along with some of the case studies.|$|E
40|$|Background: There was {{a record}} number (n = 111) of {{influenza}} outbreaks in aged care facilities in New South Wales, Australia during 2014. To determine the impact of antiviral prophylaxis recommendations in practice, influenza outbreak data were compared for facilities in which antiviral prophylaxis and treatment were recommended and for those in which antivirals were recommended for treatment only. Methods: Routinely collected outbreak data were extracted from the Notifiable Conditions Information Management System for two Local Health Districts where antiviral prophylaxis was routinely recommended and one Local Health District where antivirals were recommended for treatment but not routinely for prophylaxis. Data collected on residents included counts of influenza-like illness, confirmed influenza, hospitalizations and related deaths. <b>Dates</b> <b>of</b> onset, <b>notification,</b> influenza confirmation and antiviral recommendations were also collected for analysis. The Mann–Whitney U {{test was used to}} assess the significance of differences between group medians for key parameters. Results: A total of 41 outbreaks (12 in the prophylaxis group and 29 in the treatment-only group) were included in the analysis. There {{was no significant difference in}} overall outbreak duration; outbreak duration after notification; or attack, hospitalization or case fatality rates between the two groups. The prophylaxis group had significantly higher cases with influenza-like illness (P = 0. 03) and cases recommended antiviral treatment per facility (P = 0. 01). Discussion: This study found no significant difference in key outbreak parameters between the two groups. However, further high quality evidence is needed to guide the use of antivirals in responding to influenza outbreaks in aged care facilities. ...|$|R

40|$|Acquisition Act, 1894 clearly {{provides}} {{that the amount}} of compensation awarded for the land acquired is required to be determined on the basis of market value of the land at the time of publication of the Notification under Section 4 of the Act. Therefore, it is the duty of both, the Land Acquisition Officer as also of the court, to determine the actual compensation payable for the land acquired by referring to evidence regarding fair and just compensation near about the proximate date or on the date itself of the publication of the notification under section 4 of the Act. At times, in order to prove the actual, fair and just compensation for the land acquired, sale deeds of the adjacent land or nearabout adjacent land are produced to indicate the trend {{of the value of the}} land within the near vicinity of the acquired land. Such sale deeds are taken notice of generally when they are prior in point of time to the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>Notification,</b> and any sale deed which is dated post Notification is generally ignored, unless evidence is led to show that there was no increase in price despite such acquisition. As a result of such acquisition, the market value of the adjacent land would generally, and in most cases, go up and, therefore, such post notification transaction may not be a sound criterion to determine and assess the value of the acquired land. [Paras 12 and 14] [8 -F-H; 10 -C] 1. 2 In the instant case, the appellant has not adduced any evidence to show that the market value of adjacent land has not increased in the interregnum. Ex.

40|$|A {{field study}} in ten homes was {{conducted}} to understand what influences users’ acceptability <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in the home environment. The key finding is that perceived message urgency is the primary indicator <b>of</b> acceptability <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in the home—if people think a message is urgent, they want the message to be shown immediately, regardless {{of what they are}} doing at the time <b>of</b> <b>notification.</b> The study also shows that the acceptability of low-urgent and medium-urgent messages could be improved by taking into account mental activity load at the time <b>of</b> <b>notification.</b> No effect <b>of</b> physical activity was found on acceptability. The results suggest that to improve the scheduling <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in the home, notification systems need a mechanism assessing both the message urgency and the mental activity load, whereas physical activity can be ignored. From a methodological point of view, it is difficult to measure acceptability <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in a realistic setting, given the need to balance experimental control with realistic context.

40|$|Abstract: Bacteremia is {{associated}} with high morbidity and mortality. Improving prevention and treatment requires better knowledge {{of the disease and}} its prognosis. However, in order to study the entire spectrum of bacteremia patients, we need valid sources of information, prospective data collection, and complete follow-up. In North Denmark Region, all patients diagnosed with bacteremia have been registered in a population-based database since 1981. The information has been recorded prospectively since 1992 and the main variables are: the patient’s unique civil registration number, date of sampling the first positive blood culture, date of admission, clinical department, <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> of growth, place of acquisition, focus of infection, microbiological species, antibiogram, and empirical antimicrobial treatment. During the time from 1981 to 2008, information on 22, 556 cases of bacteremia has been recorded. The civil registration number makes it possible to link the database to other medical databases and thereby build large cohorts with detailed longitudinal data that include hospital histories since 1977, comorbidity data, and complete follow-up of survival. The database is suited for epidemiological research and, presently, approximately 60 studies have been published. Other Danish departments of clinical microbiology have recently started to record the same information and a population base of 2. 3 million will be available for future studies...|$|E
40|$|Background: With the {{increase}} of international travels, infectious disease control is gaining a greater importance across regional borders. Adequate surveillance system function is crucial to prevent a global spread of infectious disease at the earliest stage. There have been limited reports {{on the characteristics of}} infectious disease surveillance in Asia. The authors studied the timeliness of the Korean National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System with regard to major notifiable diseases from 2001 to 2006. Methods: Six notifiable infectious diseases reported relatively frequently were included in this study. Five diseases were selected by the criteria of reported cases> 100 per year: typhoid fever, shigellosis, mumps, scrub typhus, and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. In addition, dengue fever was also included to represent an emerging disease, despite its low number of cases.
