5|$|In {{the late}} spring Augustus {{suffered}} a severe illness, and on his supposed deathbed made arrangements that would ensure {{the continuation of the}} Principate in some form, while allaying senators' suspicions of his anti-republicanism. Augustus prepared to <b>hand</b> <b>down</b> his signet ring to his favored general Agrippa. However, Augustus handed over to his co-consul Piso all of his official documents, an account of public finances, and authority over listed troops in the provinces while Augustus' supposedly favored nephew Marcellus came away empty-handed. This was a surprise to many who believed Augustus would have named an heir to his position as an unofficial emperor.|$|E
5|$|At the 2007 World Championships, Lysacek {{made his}} first attempt at landing a quadruple jump in the short program. He {{attempted}} a quad-triple, but {{stepped out of the}} quad and put his <b>hand</b> <b>down,</b> and followed it with a double. He placed fifth in the short program and earned himself his first new short program personal best in two years. In the long program, he completed a quadruple toe-loop as the first part of a quad-triple combination, but lost control of the landing, adding a three turn after it, and was unable to complete the following triple as intended. He performed a double loop instead of a planned triple loop and placed fifth once again in the long program, placing fifth over all.|$|E

He got a score of 184.61, and was surpassed by Fernández with a clean free skating and a score of 216.41.|$|E
50|$|Molony {{adopted a}} tough stance. The penalty of capital {{punishment}} was regularly <b>handed</b> <b>down</b> by his judiciary during the Irish Civil War. Indeed, even after that War, Molony <b>handed</b> <b>down</b> more death sentences than would have been usual in peacetime - four such sentences were <b>handed</b> <b>down</b> in the four weeks {{towards the end of}} 1923, two on the same day, 12 December.|$|R

25|$|The Privy Council {{disagreed}} in Nireaha Tamaki v Baker, {{and other}} rulings, but courts in New Zealand continued to <b>hand</b> <b>down</b> decisions materially similar to Wi Parata. The Coal Mines Amendment Act 1903 and the Native Land Act 1909 declared aboriginal title unenforceable against the Crown.

25|$|Most {{documents}} that mention king Khufu {{were written by}} ancient Egyptian and Greek historians around 300BC. Khufu's obituary is presented there in a conflicting way: While the king enjoyed a long lasting cultural heritage preservation {{during the period of}} the Old Kingdom and the New Kingdom, the ancient historians Manetho, Diodorus and Herodotus <b>hand</b> <b>down</b> a very negative depiction of Khufu's character. Thanks to these documents, an obscure and critical picture of Khufu's personality persists.|$|E
25|$|It was {{reported}} in mid-August that some courts were advised by senior justice clerks to deal harshly with offences committed during the disturbances. The advice was said to tell the courts that they could ignore existing sentencing guidelines and <b>hand</b> <b>down</b> heavy sentences. David Cameron defended the courts for handing out tough sentences, while some Liberal Democrat MPs and civil rights groups criticised some sentences being handed down. Groups of lawyers complained that Crown Prosecutors were opposing bail in more cases than usual.|$|E

25|$|The reform {{also brought}} the Sovereign Council of New France (Conseil souverain) into existence, which was later renamed the Superior Council (Conseil supérieur). The Sovereign Council {{effectively}} acted as the functional {{equivalent of a}} Council of State (Conseil d'État) for New France, having the authority to <b>hand</b> <b>down</b> verdicts on final appeal. Initially, the Council convened once every week, and the quorum of the Sovereign Council was seven for criminal matters, or five for civil cases. The Council's practices evolved over time. At the Sovereign Council there was a king's attorney-general (procureur général du roi) {{in charge of the}} similar tasks as the district king's attorneys. He was also responsible for supervising the king's attorneys' daily operations as well as execution of royal edicts and regulations passed by the Council in their respective districts.|$|E
25|$|When in {{formation}} and standing, the color bearer keeps the military colors near his foot, holding his right <b>hand</b> <b>down</b> on the rod and {{his left hand}} on the rod, at his chest level. The rod's low end must {{be in front of}} his right foot. When saluting from this position, the military colors are bowed at horizontal for the Romanian President and other heads of state and at 45degrees for the other civil and military staff. When marching, the color bearer holds the military colors vertically. If the unit is walking more than 100m, the rod is introduced inside the scarf's muff. When traveling by vehicle, the color bearer with the military color stands inside the unit commander's car. During the march, the color bearer salutes by bowing the military colors at 45degrees, regardless the person. When two military units cross each other (either one or both of them are marching {{in formation}}) the military colors are bowed for salute at 45degrees. In case of raining, snowing or strong winds, the military colors are protected by a transparent plastic cover.|$|E

500|$|Han and {{the others}} go to Cloud City on the planet Bespin to obtain help from Han's friend Lando Calrissian (Mort), [...] "the only black guy in the galaxy", only to {{be turned over to}} Darth Vader. Han willingly reveals the {{location}} of Luke and the Rebel base but is tortured by being forced to listen to Paula Cole's [...] "Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?", as punishment for clogging a toilet on the 16th floor of Cloud City, which forced Vader to use the [...] "little pig people's" [...] bathroom. Han is used to test a carbon freezing chamber Vader intends to use on Luke {{to take him to the}} Emperor. Leia professes her love to Han, but Han tells her to [...] "fuck off" [...] and is then frozen in carbonite for posterity. Lando later double-crosses the Empire, freeing Leia, Chewbacca and C-3PO, motivating the guards with a pizza party. Despite R2-D2 having sex with the combination lock, and subsequently being discovered by her husband, to get the door open, they are too late to stop Boba Fett from flying off with Han. Luke arrives at Cloud City and, after being briefly interrupted by Ryan Seacrest on American Idol, engages Vader in a lightsaber duel. Vader cuts off Luke's right hand. With Luke cornered and defenseless, Vader goads Luke to join the dark side, revealing that he is his father. Luke casts himself into an air shaft and, after discovering that a worker has shoved his severed <b>hand</b> <b>down</b> his pants, ends up hanging on an antenna beneath the city, calling out to Ben, Leia, and Tom Selleck. Leia senses Luke's call from within the Millennium Falcon and has him rescued. On board a Nebulon-B frigate, Luke is fitted with an artificial hand, but told to practice masturbating with a hot dog first. Lando, dressed in Han's clothes, sets off with Chewbacca on the Millennium Falcon to rescue Han. Luke angrily protests the story's ambiguous ending, but then he receives a letter from Doc Brown, a reference to the ending of Back to the Future Part II.|$|E
