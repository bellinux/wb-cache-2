5|$|Another bust of {{particular}} value is the marble portrait of Armand Gaston, sculpted in 1730–1731 in Rome by Edmé Bouchardon. It is also {{displayed in the}} library. The floor of the chapel is partly covered with a 1745 <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Turkish carpet, woven in the Aubusson manufactory and bearing in its centre the coat of arms of Armand Gaston deRohan. The carpet covering the large table {{in the middle of}} the library was woven in Portuguese India around 1730. It was given to the Cathedral chapter after 1806 and sold to the Musée de Cluny in 1865 but was returned to the city of Strasbourg on permanent loan in 1939.|$|E
5|$|Bara-Suishou and Enju are {{characters}} who {{appear in the}} Rozen Maiden: Träumend anime and audio drama. Enju is Rozen's apprentice and the creator of Bara-Suishou, an <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Rozen Maiden. Enju plots a battle between Bara-Suishou and the Rozen Maidens {{in order to prove}} his superiority over Rozen. Once Bara-Suishou gathered six Rosa Mysticas, her body overloads, killing her and Enju. Bara-Suishou is voiced by Saori Gotō and English dubbed by Tara Platt.

5|$|In this episode, Michael's (Steve Carell) {{controversial}} <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Chris Rock routine {{forces the}} staff to undergo a racial diversity seminar. A consultant (Larry Wilmore) arrives to teach the staff about tolerance and diversity, but Michael insists on imparting his own knowledge—aggravating both the consultant and the entire office staff—and creates his own diversity seminar. He eventually assigns each staff member an index card with a different race on it, causing tempers to slowly simmer until they finally snap. Meanwhile, Jim struggles to keep hold of a lucrative contract extension, but Dwight makes the sale for himself.|$|E
5|$|Potter {{either had}} no live {{models for the}} eastern {{chipmunk}} characters, or borrowed a pet chipmunk from a cousin. Initially, {{she may have been}} unsure of how to draw the chipmunks and chose to clothe them, then was forced to follow suit and clothe the two main players as well, while leaving the other squirrels in their natural state. Or, she may have clothed Timmy and Goody because they collect their nuts in sacks (an unnatural way for squirrels to behave) in <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ruse she employed in Peter Rabbit when Peter only walks on his hind legs while wearing his blue jacket. When he loses his jacket, he reverts to being an animal and moves about on all fours. Because Timmy and Chippy were not drawn from nature, the two suggest stuffed animals in their lack of engaging facial expressions.|$|E

25|$|In late May, the {{government}} launched an official campaign, costing 5 million kroner. It was instantly criticised for being one-sided, undemocratic and patronising.

25|$|Une Larme du diable (1839) ("The Devil's Tear") {{was written}} shortly after Gautier's trip to Belgium in 1836. The work is {{considered}} an <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Medieval mystery play, a type of drama popular in the 14th century. These plays were usually performed in churches because they were religious in nature. In Gautier's play God cheats a bit to win a bet with Satan. The play is humorous and preaches both in favour and against human love.|$|E

25|$|First, {{the court}} held that an {{imitation}} leading to confusion as to the source of the websites and the associated free riding on the goodwill of Facebook's website requires a certain degree of public awareness of the website. However, {{at the time of the}} introduction of StudiVz to the German market (November 2005) Facebook had not yet established the critical level of awareness in order to justify a claim for improper <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> famous website. Rather, until September 2006, Facebook was only designed for North American students and thus did not reach the required degree of public awareness.|$|E
25|$|With Unchiașul Sărăcie (also {{written in}} verse), Macedonski took Naturalist tenets {{into the field}} of drama. Frédéric Damé {{believed}} it an <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> play by Ernest d'Hervilly and Alfred Grévin, but, Vianu argues, the Romanian text was only loosely based on theirs: in Macedonski's adaptation, the theme became fairy tale-like, and used a speech style based on Romanian folklore. Around {{the time of its}} completion, Macedonski was also working on a similarly loose adaptation of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, which notably had the two protagonists die in each other's arms. Another such play is 3 decemvrie ("December 3"), which partly retells Friedrich Ludwig Zacharias Werner's Der 24 Februar using Naturalist devices. By contrast, the homage-play Cuza-Vodă is mainly a Romantic piece, where Alexander John Cuza finds his political mission validated by legendary figures in Romanian history.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{with the}} October 24, 1937 radio show, where Jack proudly {{announced}} {{the purchase of}} his car, a running joke was that Benny drove an old Maxwell automobile, a brand that {{went out of business}} in 1925. Although some details such as the car's body style and its exact model year would vary over the years, what remained constant was that Benny's old car was so worn out that it would barely run, but the miserly Benny insisted he could get a few more miles out of it. Many of the sound effects for the car’s clattering engine came from an actual old motor which the sound effects shop had salvaged from a Los Angeles junkyard. When a sound effects man missed a cue for the automobile engine, Mel Blanc quickly improvised a vocal <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sputtering car engine starting up noisily that was so funny it became a regular feature of the show.|$|E

25|$|The Wanamaker Organ was {{originally}} {{built by the}} Los Angeles Art Organ Company, successors to the Murray M. Harris Organ Co., for the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. It {{was designed to be}} the largest organ in the world, an <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> full-size orchestra with particularly complete resources of full organ tone including mixtures. In addition to its console, the organ {{was originally}} equipped with an automatic player that used punched rolls of paper, according to the Los Angeles Times of 1904. It was designed by renowned organ theorist and architect George Ashdown Audsley. Wild cost overruns plagued the project, with the result that Harris was ousted from his own company. With capital from stockholder Eben Smith, it was reorganized as the Los Angeles Art Organ Company, and finished at a cost of $105,000 (equal to $ today), $40,000 over budget, equal to $ today. The Fair began (in late April 1904) before the organ was fully installed in its temporary home, Festival Hall. It still was not entirely finished in September of that year, when Alexandre Guilmant, {{one of the most famous}} organists of the day, presented 40 very well-attended recitals on the organ.|$|E

Colbert recalled that [...] "not {{a lot of people}} laughed in the front row" [...] during the speech, and that [...] "when it was over, no one was even making eye contact with me ... no one is talking to me in the whole damn room"; only Scalia came to him afterward, praising Colbert's <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gesture the justice had recently been photographed making.|$|E
500|$|Eastlake's {{translation}} is generally accepted. The possibility {{of it being}} a variant of [...] "Timothy" [...] has been discounted, as that word was not used in Northern Europe before the Reformation. There is no Germanic name that might imply a humanistic <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Greek word, so art historians have sought to identify the man from Greek history or legend. Although some have suggested certain Athenian and Syrian generals, these have been discounted as the sitter is not wearing military clothing. Saint Timothy, first Bishop of Ephesus and an associate of Saint Paul, has been suggested but eliminated as the man is not dressed as a high cleric.|$|E

These cognitive functions have been adopted from informal descriptions of mirror neuron and super mirror neuron functions in neurological literature.

500|$|The {{governments of}} the Northern Administration and the Southern Administration {{operated}} very differently. The Northern Administration operated under a system which Twitchett and Tietze called [...] "essentially a great tribal leader's personal retinue". Many of the governmental appointments dealt with tribal affairs, herds, and retainers serving the imperial house, and most powerful and high-ranking positions dealt with military affairs. The overwhelming majority of officeholders were Khitans, mainly from the imperial Yelü clan and the Xiao consort clan. The Southern Administration was more heavily structured, with Twitchett and Tietze calling it [...] "designed in <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> T'ang model". Unlike the Northern Administration, many of the low- and medium-ranked officials in the Southern Administration were Chinese.|$|E

[...] Toyoharu titled another A Perspective View of French Churches in Holland, though he based it on a print of the Roman Forum. [...] Toyoharu took licence with other details of foreign lands, such as having the Dutch swim in their canals. [...] Japanese and Chinese mythology were also frequent subjects in Toyoharu's [...] prints, the foreign perspective technique giving such prints an exotic feel.|$|E
