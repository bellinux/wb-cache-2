5|$|Sid {{finds the}} eighth spirit at the crater {{site of the}} alien asteroid's impact on Earth. <b>He</b> <b>lowers</b> a {{shielded}} vehicle, with Aki and Gray aboard, into the crater to locate the final spirit. Just before they can reach it, Hein fires the Zeus cannon into the crater, not only destroying the eighth spirit but also revealing the Phantom Gaia. Aki has {{a vision of the}} Phantom home planet, where she is able to receive the eighth spirit from the alien particles in herself. When Aki awakens, she and Gray combine it with the other seven. Hein continues to fire the Zeus cannon despite overheating warnings and unintentionally destroys the cannon and himself. Gray sacrifices himself as a medium needed to physically transmit the completed spirit into the alien Gaia. The Earth's Gaia is returned to normal as the Phantoms ascend into space, finally at peace. Aki is pulled from the crater holding Gray's body, and is seen looking into the newly liberated world.|$|E
500|$|Bart plays a prank when <b>he</b> <b>lowers</b> a radio down a {{well and}} speaks through {{it with the}} microphone, tricking the townspeople into {{thinking}} an orphan named Timmy O'Toole has fallen down the well. Although {{they are unable to}} get [...] "Timmy" [...] out, as the well is too small for any adult to fit in, the entire town offers moral support and {{do everything they can to}} give him hope. Krusty even gets musician Sting to join other celebrities in recording a charity single, [...] "We're Sending Our Love Down the Well". However, Lisa catches Bart in the act and reminds him he put a label with his name on the radio. Bart falls into the well while trying to retrieve it after Eddie and Lou untie his rope. When the townspeople find him, he admits that Timmy O'Toole does not exist. Angry at being tricked, the townspeople leave Bart in the well.|$|E
500|$|Several remixes were {{commissioned}} for [...] "Honey," [...] {{most notably the}} Bad Boy remix and the Classic mix, the latter of which appears on Carey's remix compilation The Remixes (2003). The former {{is similar to the}} original version, {{with the addition of a}} new spoken intro from Carey in which she states, [...] "I thought I told you, we won't stop." [...] The string chords present in the original [...] "Honey" [...] are entirely excised from the Bad Boy remix, and it features rapping verses by The Lox and Mase (who did the bridge on the original version). The rap from Mase entirely replaces the second chorus of the song, while the Lox's parts replaces a section of the song's bridge. The song's main remix, [...] "Honey" [...] (Bad Boy remix), has an accompanying music video, with additional sequences directed by Paul Hunter. Much of the footage from the video is from the original, with few new scenes featuring Carey with Puffy, Mase and the Lox in a long golden tunnel flowing with water ("The Honey Tunnel"). During Mase's rap, Carey is rescued by them (rather than joining the sailors on the boat) when <b>he</b> <b>lowers</b> a rope into the ocean from his helicopter.|$|E

2500|$|One {{side of the}} Warren Cup {{depicts a}} [...] "bearded man" [...] and a [...] "beardless youth" [...] {{engaging}} in anal sex in a reclining position, with the youth lowering himself using a strap or sash to be penetrated. A boy watches from behind a door. The two figures {{do not appear to}} be a great difference in age and are of a similar size. The apparent weight of the upper figure, as <b>he</b> <b>lowers</b> himself onto his lover's penis using the support, makes this a non-traditional passive role. The use of a strap or support during sex can be found in other Greek and Roman artworks, a close example being an erotic cup by Onesimos where a woman spreads her legs in anticipation while grasping a strap with her left hand.|$|E
2500|$|In 219, L端 Meng {{came up with}} a plan to help Sun Quan seize {{control of}} Liu Bei's territories in Jing Province. He pretended to be sick and asked for {{permission}} to return to Jianye to seek medical treatment. Sun Quan played along by pretending to approve his request. Lu Xun went to visit L端 Meng and said, [...] "Guan Yu is near the border. How can we remain far behind the border and not worry about having to guard against him?" [...] L端 Meng replied, [...] "What you've said is true, but I'm seriously ill now." [...] Lu Xun then said, [...] "Guan Yu is proud of his own valour and he scorns others. He may have made great achievements, but he's overly conceited. Besides, he's heading north and he has never seen us a threat. When he knows you're sick, he'll definitely lower his defences. If we attack him when <b>he</b> <b>lowers</b> his guard, we can capture him. I came here to discuss with you a plan to attack him." [...] L端 Meng replied, [...] "Guan Yu is known for his bravery and ferocity in battle, and he's a formidable foe. Besides, he's in control of Jing Province. He governs with virtue and has made great accomplishments, while the morale of his army is at its peak. It won't be easy to defeat him." ...|$|E

60|$|The dust drifts away. Incredible!--that enchanted {{horse and}} rider have passed a ravine and are {{climbing}} another slope to unveil another conspiracy of silence, {{to thwart the}} will of another armed host. Another moment and that crest too is in eruption. The horse rears and strikes the air with its forefeet. They are down at last. But look again--the man has detached himself from the dead animal. He stands erect, motionless, holding his sabre {{in his right hand}} straight above his head. His face is toward us. Now <b>he</b> <b>lowers</b> his hand to a level with his face and moves it outward, the blade of the sabre describing a downward curve. It is a sign to us, to the world, to posterity.

Suddenly <b>he</b> <b>lowers</b> the glass and says {{a few words to}} those about him. Two or three aides detach themselves from the group and canter away into the woods, along the lines in each direction. We did not hear his words, but we know them: [...] "Tell General X. to send forward the skirmish line." [...] Those of us who have been out of place resume our positions; the men resting at ease straighten themselves and the ranks are re-formed without a command. Some of us staff officers dismount and look at our saddle girths; those already on the ground remount.|$|E

It has been, I dare say, the same with you as with me. We both went into office early, and the anxiety to do special duties well probably deterred us both from thinking much of the great question. When a man {{has to be on}} the alert to keep Ireland quiet, or to prevent peculation in the dockyards, or to raise the revenue while <b>he</b> <b>lowers</b> the taxes, he feels himself to be saved from the necessity of investigating principles. In this way I sometimes think that ministers, or they who have been ministers and who have to watch ministers from the opposition benches, have less opportunity of becoming real politicians than the men who sit in Parliament with empty hands and with time at their own disposal. But when a man has been placed by circumstances as I am now, he does begin to think." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{scene is}} {{the blue and}} white {{room in the house}} of the Misses Susan and Phoebe Throssel in Quality Street; and in this little country town there is a {{satisfaction}} about living in Quality Street which even religion cannot give. Through the bowed window at the back we have a glimpse of the street. It is pleasantly broad and grass-grown, and is linked to the outer world by one demure shop, whose door rings a bell every time it opens and shuts. Thus by merely peeping, every one in Quality Street can know at once who has been buying a Whimsy cake, and usually why. This bell is the most familiar sound of Quality Street. Now and again ladies pass in their pattens, a maid perhaps protecting them with an umbrella, for flakes of snow are falling discreetly. Gentlemen in the street are an event; but, see, just as we raise the curtain, there goes the recruiting sergeant to remind us {{that we are in the}} period of the Napoleonic wars. If he were to look in at the window of the blue and white room all the ladies there assembled would draw themselves up; they know him for a rude fellow who smiles at the approach of maiden ladies and continues to smile after they have passed. However, <b>he</b> <b>lowers</b> his head to-day so that they shall not see him, his present design being converse with the Misses Throssel's maid.|$|E
60|$|There {{are those}} who do not believe this. Provided they are tolerably {{attentive}} to the duties of religion, it does not matter much, they fancy, what they think of out of church. Their souls will be saved at last, they suppose, and that is all that they need care for. Saved? They do not see that by giving way to foul, mean, foolish thoughts all the week they are losing their souls, destroying their souls, defiling their souls, lowering their souls, and making them so coarse and mean and poor that they are not worth saving, and are no loss to heaven or earth, whatever loss they may be to the man himself. One man thinks of nothing but money--how he shall save a penny here and a penny there. I do not mean men of business; for them there are great excuses; for it is by continual saving here and there that their profits are made. I speak rather of people who have no excuse, people of fixed incomes--people often wealthy and comfortable, who yet will lower their minds by continually thinking over their money. But this I say, and this I am sure that you will find, that when a man in business or out of business accustoms himself, as very many do, to think of nothing but money, money, money from Monday morning to Saturday night, he thinks of money a great part of Sunday likewise. And so, after a while, the man lowers his soul, and makes it mean and covetous. He forgets all that is lovely and of good report. He forgets virtue--that is manliness; and praise--that is the just respect and admiration of his fellow-men; and so he forgets at last things true, honest, and just likewise. <b>He</b> <b>lowers</b> his soul; and therefore when he is tempted, he does things mean and false and unjust, for the sake of money, which he has made his idol.|$|E
60|$|Those words {{made him}} hesitate. <b>He</b> <b>lowered</b> the pistol slowly to his side. I began to breathe freely.|$|R

60|$|Upon {{that word}} <b>he</b> <b>lowered</b> his voice; {{it was a}} word that seemed to unveil the skies for Rachel.|$|R
60|$|Now let us {{change the}} example a little further. Suppose that the {{monopolist}} has for sale {{not simply a}} fixed and definite quantity of a certain article, but something which he can produce in larger quantities as desired. At what price will he now sell? If he offers the article {{at a very high}} price only a few people will take it: if <b>he</b> <b>lowers</b> the price there will be more and more purchasers. His interest seems divided. He will want to put the price as high as possible so that the profit on each single article (over what it costs him to produce it) will be as great as possible. But he will also want to make as many sales as he possibly can, which will induce him to set the price low enough to bring in new buyers. But, of course, if he puts the price so low that it only covers the cost of making the goods his profit is all gone and the mere multiplicity of sales is no good to him. He must try therefore to find a point of maximum profit where, having in view both the number of sales and the profit over cost on each sale the net profit is at its greatest. This gives us the fundamental law of monopoly price. It is to be noted that under modern conditions of production the cost of manufacture per article decreases to a great extent in proportion as a larger and larger number is produced and thus the widening of the sale lowers the proportionate cost. In any particular case, therefore, it may turn out that the price that suits the monopolist's own interest is quite a low price, one such as to allow for an enormous quantity of sales and a very low cost of manufacture. This, we say, may be the case. But it is not so of necessity. In and of itself the monopoly price corresponds to the monopolist's profit and not to cheapness of sale. The price may be set far above the cost.|$|E
6000|$|Thus {{spoke to}} my lady the knight[2] full of care, [...] "Let me have your advice in a weighty affair. This Hamilton's bawn, while it sticks {{in my hand}} I lose by the house what I get by the land; But how to dispose {{of it to the}} best bidder, For a barrack[6] or malt-house, we now must consider. [...] "First, let me suppose I make it a malt-house, Here I have {{computed}} the profit will fall t'us: There's nine hundred pounds for labour and grain, I increase it to twelve, so three hundred remain; A handsome addition for wine and good cheer, Three dishes a-day, and three hogsheads a-year; With a dozen large vessels my vault shall be stored; No little scrub joint shall come on my board; And you and the Dean no more shall combine To stint me at night to one bottle of wine; Nor shall I, for his humour, permit you to purloin A stone and a quarter of beef from my sir-loin. If I make it a barrack, the crown is my tenant; My dear, I have ponder'd again and again on't: In poundage and drawbacks I lose half my rent, Whatever they give me, I must be content, Or join with the court in every debate; And rather than that, I would lose my estate." [...] Thus ended the knight; thus began his meek wife: [...] "It must, and it shall be a barrack, my life. I'm grown a mere mopus; no company comes But a rabble of tenants, and rusty dull rums.[5] With parsons what lady can keep herself clean? I'm all over daub'd when I sit by the Dean. But if you will give us a barrack, my dear, The captain I'm sure will always come here; I then shall not value his deanship a straw, For the captain, I warrant, will keep him in awe; Or, should he pretend to be brisk and alert, Will tell him that chaplains should not be so pert; That men of his coat should be minding their prayers, And not among ladies to give themselves airs." [...] Thus argued my lady, but argued in vain; The knight his opinion resolved to maintain. [...] But Hannah,[6] who listen'd to all that was past, And could not endure so vulgar a taste, As soon as her ladyship call'd to be dress'd, Cried, [...] "Madam, why surely my master's possess'd, Sir Arthur the maltster! how fine it will sound! I'd rather the bawn were sunk under ground. But, madam, I guess'd there would never come good, When I saw him so often with Darby and Wood.[7] And now my dream's out; for I was a-dream'd That I saw a huge rat--O dear, how I scream'd! And after, methought, I had lost my new shoes; And Molly, she said, I should hear some ill news. [...] "Dear Madam, had you but the spirit to tease, You might have a barrack whenever you please: And, madam, I always believed you so stout, That for twenty denials you would not give out. If I had a husband like him, I purtest, Till he gave me my will, I would give him no rest; And, rather than come in the same pair of sheets With such a cross man, I would lie in the streets: But, madam, I beg you, contrive and invent, And worry him out, till he gives his consent. Dear madam, whene'er of a barrack I think, An I were to be hang'd, I can't sleep a wink: For if a new crotchet comes into my brain, I can't get it out, though I'd never so fain. I fancy already a barrack contrived At Hamilton's bawn, and the troop is arrived; Of this to be sure, Sir Arthur has warning, And waits on the captain betimes the next morning. [...] "Now see, when they meet, how their honours behave; 'Noble captain, your servant'--'Sir Arthur, your slave; You honour me much'--'The honour is mine.'-- ''Twas a sad rainy night'--'But the morning is fine.'-- 'Pray, how does my lady?'--'My wife's at your service.'-- 'I think I have seen her picture by Jervas.'-- 'Good-morrow, good captain'--'I'll wait on you down'-- 'You shan't stir a foot'--'You'll think me a clown.'-- 'For all the world, captain, not half an inch farther'-- 'You must be obey'd--Your servant, Sir Arthur! My humble respects to my lady unknown.'-- 'I hope you will use my house as your own.'" [...] "Go bring me my smock, and leave off your prate, Thou hast certainly gotten a cup in thy pate." [...] "Pray, madam, be quiet: what was it I said? You had like to have put it quite out of my head. Next day to be sure, the captain will come, At the head of his troop, with trumpet and drum. Now, madam, observe how he marches in state: The man with the kettle-drum enters the gate: Dub, dub, adub, dub. The trumpeters follow. Tantara, tantara; while all the boys holla. See now comes the captain all daub'd with gold lace: O la! the sweet gentleman! look in his face; And see how he rides like a lord of the land, With the fine flaming sword that he holds in his hand; And his horse, the dear creter, it prances and rears; With ribbons in knots at its tail and its ears: At last comes the troop, by word of command, Drawn up in our court; when the captain cries, STAND! Your ladyship lifts up the sash to be seen, For sure I had dizen'd you out like a queen. The captain, to show he is proud of the favour, Looks up to your window, and cocks up his beaver; (His beaver is cock'd: pray, madam, mark that, For a captain of horse never takes off his hat, Because he has never a hand that is idle, For the right holds the sword, and the left holds the bridle;) Then flourishes thrice his sword in the air, As a compliment due to a lady so fair; (How I tremble to think of the blood it has spilt!) Then <b>he</b> <b>lowers</b> down the point, and kisses the hilt. Your ladyship smiles, and thus you begin: 'Pray, captain, be pleased to alight and walk in.' The captain salutes you with congee profound, And your ladyship curtseys half way to the ground. 'Kit, run to your master, and bid him come to us; I'm sure he'll be proud of the honour you do us; And, captain, you'll do us the favour to stay, And take a short dinner here with us to-day: You're heartily welcome; but as for good cheer, You come in the very worst time of the year; If I had expected so worthy a guest--' 'Lord, madam! your ladyship sure is in jest; You banter me, madam; the kingdom must grant--' 'You officers, captain, are so complaisant!'"-- [...] "Hist, hussey, I think I hear somebody coming [...] "-- [...] "No madam: 'tis only Sir Arthur a-humming. To shorten my tale, (for I hate a long story,) The captain at dinner appears in his glory; The dean and the doctor[8] have humbled their pride, For the captain's entreated to sit by your side; And, because he's their betters, you carve for him first; The parsons for envy are ready to burst. The servants, amazed, are scarce ever able To keep off their eyes, as they wait at the table; And Molly and I have thrust in our nose, To peep at the captain in all his fine clo'es. Dear madam, be sure he's a fine spoken man, Do but hear on the clergy how glib his tongue ran; And, 'madam,' says he, 'if such dinners you give, You'll ne'er want for parsons as long as you live. I ne'er knew a parson without a good nose; But the devil's as welcome, wherever he goes: G--d d--n me! they bid us reform and repent, But, z--s! by their looks, they never keep Lent: Mister curate, for all your grave looks, I'm afraid You cast a sheep's eye on her ladyship's maid: I wish she would lend you her pretty white hand In mending your cassock, and smoothing your band: (For the Dean was so shabby, and look'd like a ninny, That the captain supposed he was curate to Jinny.) 'Whenever you see a cassock and gown, A hundred to one but it covers a clown. Observe how a parson comes into a room; G--d d--n me, he hobbles as bad as my groom; A scholard, when just from his college broke loose, Can hardly tell how to cry bo to a goose; Your Noveds, and Bluturks, and Omurs,[9] and stuff By G--, they don't signify this pinch of snuff. To give a young gentleman right education, The army's the only good school in the nation: My schoolmaster call'd me a dunce and a fool, But at cuffs I was always the cock of the school; I never could take to my book for the blood o' me, And the puppy confess'd he expected no good o' me. He caught me one morning coquetting his wife, But he maul'd me, I ne'er was so maul'd in my life: [10] So I took to the road, and, what's very odd, The first man I robb'd was a parson, by G--. Now, madam, you'll think it a strange thing to say, But the sight of a book makes me sick to this day. [...] "Never since I was born did I hear so much wit, And, madam, I laugh'd till I thought I should split. So then you look'd scornful, and snift at the Dean, As who should say, 'Now, am I skinny[11] and lean?' But he durst not so much as once open his lips, And the doctor was plaguily down in the hips." [...] Thus merciless Hannah ran on in her talk, Till she heard the Dean call, [...] "Will your ladyship walk?" [...] Her ladyship answers, [...] "I'm just coming down:" [...] Then, turning to Hannah, and forcing a frown, Although it was plain in her heart she was glad, Cried, [...] "Hussey, why sure the wench is gone mad! How could these chimeras get into your brains!-- Come hither and take this old gown for your pains. But the Dean, if this secret should come to his ears, Will never have done with his gibes and his jeers: For your life, not a word of the matter I charge ye: Give me but a barrack, a fig for the clergy." ...|$|E
