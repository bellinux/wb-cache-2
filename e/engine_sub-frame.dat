5000|$|Rather than replicating the {{unchanged}} {{designs of}} the GM pony cars, Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird, the Mustang II now competed against sporty subcompact models that included GM's Buick Skyhawk, Oldsmobile Starfire, Pontiac Sunbird, and Chevrolet Monza. The new model would also better compete with 2+2 import coupes {{such as the}} Toyota Celica, Datsun 240Z, Mazda RX-3, and the European Ford Capri [...] - [...] which itself {{was inspired by the}} original Mustang but built by Ford of Europe, and marketed since April 1970 in the U.S. by Mercury as a captive import. It saw a new competitor from Germany in 1974 with the Volkswagen Scirocco, and the BMW 2002 introduced earlier in the late 1960s. The new design featured rack and pinion steering and a separate <b>engine</b> <b>sub-frame</b> that decreased noise, vibration, and harshness.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze the possibility of the replacement of the <b>engine</b> <b>sub-frame,</b> which at present is made of steel or in some advanced cases in lightweight metals, with a new component made of Carbon/Epoxy composite material. A methodology is developed that helps to point out and solve the existing major problems with respect to the use of composite structures, by taking advantage from composite features such as the effect of variation of stacking sequence, ply angles, and stiffeners on load carrying capacity and stiffness of <b>engine</b> <b>sub-frame.</b> Furthermore, detailed numerical analysis has been performed to determine the natural frequencies and modes shapes of the proposed solutions. Results show competitive performance (with particular attention to the equivalent stiffness and natural frequency) of the new proposed solution based on composite material with respect to thereference steel sub-frame solutio...|$|E
50|$|There {{was also}} a version called Golf Country (7.735 cars), co-manufactured by Steyr-Daimler-Puch in Austria, {{designed}} for medium off-road driving. It had more suspension travel, Syncro four-wheel drive, improved ground clearance of 21 cm, bullbars at front and rear (generally over a single headlight grille), a skid plate for protecting the <b>engine</b> area, <b>sub-frame</b> to protect the rear Syncro differential and propshaft and a spare wheel mounted externally on a swing-away triangular frame on the back.|$|R

For {{the problem}} that car {{sub-frame}} constraint connection complex and effective load more difficult to determine, using finite element and multi-body dynamics ADAMS co-simulation method, Analyzed on a Volkswagen vehicle sub-frame, obtained the accurate load on the sub-frame which are used by engine suspension. The finite element analysis results show that engine load is {{the greatest impact on}} the sub-frame stress field, which can be reduced by increasing the area of <b>engine</b> and the <b>sub-frame</b> contacting, thereby prolong the life of sub-frame...|$|R
50|$|As a rebranded and {{modified}} Ford Five Hundred, the 5G Taurus featured an engine with 30% more power; a front facelift; chrome-trimmed, fender-located faux engine vents; revised tail lights; and increased sound absorption measures, including foam pellets expanded into the A-pillars {{and a new}} sound-absorptive material, marketed as Sonosorb, used throughout the body. The 5G Taurus used a new 6-speed automatic transmission (the GM-Ford 6-speed automatic transmission, jointly developed with General Motors), {{in contrast to the}} Aisin 6-speed used in the Five Hundred, and was no longer equipped with the CVT. Handling was revised by re-engineering the front end - transferring the weight of the <b>engine</b> from the <b>sub-frame</b> directly to the chassis via hydraulic mounts - increasing front suspension travel by 10mm (10%) and retuning the suspension.|$|R
