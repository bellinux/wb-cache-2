25|$|Thailand has {{observed}} global patterns of an enlarging elderly class: as fertility control is encouraged and medical advances are made, births shrink and lives age. The Thai government is noticing {{and concerned about}} this trend, but tends to let families care for their elderly members rather than create extraneous policies for them. As of 2011, there are only 25 state sponsored homes for the elderly, {{with no more than}} a few thousand members of each home. Such programs are largely run by volunteers and are questionable by quality of care, considering there is not always a guarantee care will be available. Private care <b>is</b> <b>tough</b> <b>to</b> follow, often based on assumptions. Because children are less likely to care for their parents, private caretakers are in demand. Volunteer NGOs are available but in very limited quantities.|$|E

500|$|Arsenal {{were drawn}} in Group B, along with Italian club Inter Milan, Lokomotiv Moscow of Russia and Ukraine's Dynamo Kyiv. Wenger {{believed}} the trips to Eastern Europe threatened his team's {{chances of winning}} the Premier League: [...] "The other English teams have more comfortable groups than we do. It <b>is</b> <b>tough</b> <b>to</b> go to Russia – I always {{say that if you}} have to travel more than two hours it is difficult. Sometimes the players pay a high price in the games that follow the Champions League matches." ...|$|E
500|$|The band's follow-up, Even If It Kills Me (2007), was {{recorded}} in New York City with Eli Janney and Adam Schlesinger of Fountains of Wayne, and Ric Ocasek of the Cars. The group, though big fans of his work, were disappointed with Ocasek's role. [...] "He just confused me the whole time," [...] said Pierre later, who noted that {{he was afraid to}} disclose that the experience was a [...] "bum-out." [...] Pierre struggled with writer's block during the sessions and found himself writing lyrics while recording the songs, which he had never done before. The band was also worried their songs would not be catchy enough after their last album was so successful. During this time, Pierre's substance abuse nearly disbanded the group. [...] "I think it's an understatement to say it <b>is</b> <b>tough</b> <b>to</b> be tied to Justin's emotions," [...] Cain later remarked. Following completion of the album, Pierre entered a three-week rehabilitation program for alcohol and drug abuse. The band was apart for a six-week stretch in the summer of 2007, marking their longest break apart in five years. [...] "It might sound cliched, but we all had a chance to do some growing up," [...] said Cain.|$|E

It was the sixth runner-up finish of Mickelson's career at the U.S. Open, an event record and only behind Jack Nicklaus's seven runner-up finishes at The Open Championship. After the event, Mickelson called the loss heartbreaking and said [...] "this <b>is</b> <b>tough</b> <b>to</b> swallow after coming so close ... I felt like this was as good an opportunity I could ask for and to not get it ... it hurts." [...] It was also Father's Day, which happened to be his birthday.|$|E

2500|$|The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation {{offered the}} {{following}} summary {{as to the}} long term effects of sex-selective abortion and abandonment of female infants: [...] "Multiple research studies have also found that sex-selective abortion – where a woman undergoes an ultrasound to determine the sex of her baby, and then aborts it if it's a girl – was widespread for years, particularly for second or subsequent children. Millions of female fetuses have been aborted since the 1970s. [...] China outlawed sex selective abortions in 2005, but the law <b>is</b> <b>tough</b> <b>to</b> enforce {{because of the difficulty}} of proving why a couple decided to have an abortion. The abandonment, and killing, of baby girls has also been reported, though recent research studies say it has become rare, in part due to strict criminal prohibitions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Garvey {{split up}} with his {{long-term}} girlfriend, journalist and novelist Emma Jane Unsworth, during {{the making of the}} album, which led him to revise some of the album's lyrics. Talking about the album's opening track, [...] "This Blue World", Garvey originally stated, [...] "It's almost saying, everything from the beginning of time was leading up to the day we met. So that's very romantic, but something I'm fond of doing, when I'm offering a huge romantic gesture, is to point out the realities as well." [...] After the break-up, he said that the song [...] "was about this mythical mix of ex-girlfriends, it's really about her, it's this prophetic thing. I added some lyrics at the end, about imagining her going on and having a family without me, which <b>is</b> <b>tough</b> <b>to</b> swallow." ...|$|E

The episode {{was nominated for}} the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour) in 2008, losing to the episode of The Simpsons [...] "Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind". Dan Iverson of IGN praised the special, calling it [...] "head and shoulders above the hit and miss nature of the regular episodes of Robot Chicken." [...] He concluded that [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>tough</b> <b>to</b> find anything wrong with [...] " [...] and [...] "Robot Chicken went all out in creating a humorous half hour which would have us [...] nerds rolling on the floor laughing." [...] Variety reviewer Brian Lowry praised the episode adding that [...] "Lucas' fantasy has frequently sailed the smoothest when he takes a back seat and leaves the starship piloting to someone else." [...] Aubry D'Arminio of Entertainment Weekly, in reviewing the DVD, stated [...] "Every adult cartoon, from Family Guy to The Simpsons, has spawned a Star Wars parody, but the stop-motion maniacs at Robot Chicken top them all with 23 guffaw-filled minutes." [...] Noel Murray of The A.V. Club gave an overall positive review stating the episode has [...] "15 minutes of good gags" [...] and [...] "is pitched to anyone who grew up playing with the lesser-known Star Wars toys: the Ugnaughts, Bossks, and Dengars of the Kenner line." ...|$|E
