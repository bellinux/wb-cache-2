So, in December 1940 Fermi and Szilard met with Herbert G. MacPherson and V. C. Hamister at National Carbon to discuss the possible existence of impurities in graphite. During this conversation it became clear that minute quantities of boron impurities were the source of the problem.|$|E

Fermi recalled that: [...] We went to Dean Pegram, who was then the man who could carry out magic around the University, and we explained to him that we needed a big room. He scouted around the campus and we went with him to dark corridors and under various heating pipes and so on, to visit possible sites for this experiment and eventually a big room was discovered in Schermerhorn Hall.|$|E
40|$|This is {{the monthly}} 100 areas {{technical}} activities {{report for the}} physics group {{for the month of}} July 1951. This group was concerned with pile related studies. Work discussed includes neutron attenuation measurements in pile shielding test facilities, studies of physical properties of shielding materials (concrete), work on a xenon generator and separation facility, further development and shielding work for a neutron spectrometer, continued work on a magnetic spectrometer, and counting equipment. Studies of neutron fluxes from <b>exponential</b> <b>piles,</b> and criticality studies are also discussed...|$|R
25|$|Unfortunately for the Soviets, the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Physik (KWIP, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics) had mostly {{been moved}} in 1943 and 1944 to Hechingen and its {{neighboring}} town of Haigerloch, {{on the edge}} of the Black Forest, which eventually became the French occupation zone. This move allowed the Americans to take into custody a large number of German scientists associated with nuclear research. The only section of the institute which remained in Berlin was the low-temperature physics section, headed by Ludwig Bewilogua, who was in charge of the <b>exponential</b> uranium <b>pile.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ludwig Bewilogua, {{head of the}} KWIP’s low {{temperature}} physics section, had remained behind and {{in charge of the}} <b>exponential</b> uranium <b>pile</b> after the other sections were moved to Hechingen. He, his staff, and the entire facility contents were taken to the Soviet Union. Other scientists sent to the Soviet Union included Robert Döpel (atomic scientist from Leipzig), Wilhelm Eitel (chemist), Reinhold Reichmann (isotope separation, sent to work with Barwich), Gustav Richter (a colleague of Hertz at Siemens and assigned to heavy water production at NII-9), W. Schütze (isotope separation and cyclotrons) and Karl Günter Zimmer (atomic physicist and biologist from the Kaiser-Wilhelm Gesellschaft Institute for Brain Research in Berlin-Buch and also working with Riehl at Auergesellschaft).|$|R
5000|$|In February 1940, using {{funds that}} were {{allocated}} {{partly as a}} result of the Einstein-Szilard letter to President Roosevelt, Leo Szilard purchased 4 tons of graphite from National Carbon for use in Enrico Fermi's experimental reactor, the so-called <b>exponential</b> <b>pile.</b> Fermi writes that [...] "The results of this experiment was sic somewhat discouraging" [...] presumably due to the absorption of neutrons by some unknown impurity. So, in December 1940 Fermi and Szilard met with H. G. MacPherson and V. C. Hamister at National Carbon to discuss the possible existence of impurities in graphite, without specifically describing the reasons for their visit. Having previously (September 1939) read the article of R. B. Roberts and J. B. H. Kuper (which described the necessity of a moderator in a chain reaction), MacPherson was able to deduce the purpose of the visit. Because of his experience with the spectra of carbon arcs he realized that even high quality graphite contains minute quantities of boron impurities that could make it potentially unusable as a neutron moderator in a uranium reactor, confirming a suspicion of Szilard.|$|E
40|$|Absolute soil {{concentrations}} of 238 U, 232 Th, 40 K, and 137 Cs samples were measured using high-resolution gamma spectrometry. The {{area of interest}} encompasses an embankment in a mangrove swamp in Guaratiba, Rio de Janeiro, called Capao Island, where nuclear, chemical and biological defense laboratories of the Brazilian Army Technology Center are in operation for more than 30 years. In {{order to ensure that}} no significant environmental impact has resulted from neutron physics experiments performed in a graphite <b>exponential</b> <b>pile</b> in addition to the operation of two cesium-driven irradiating facilities, radiation monitoring of the isotopes was carried out. A total of eight 250 ml soil samples were extracted within an area of 300 m x 300 m. No trace of 137 Cs was detected and the measured levels of 238 U were found to be close to the global mean. However, some data that slightly exceeded the expected normal range for 232 Th (60 % of samples) and 40 K (20 % of samples) should be attributed to the construction debris (cement, rocks, and sand) used in the embankment at the site. Since there is no handling of those isotopes at that site or adjacent facilities that could affect their presence, it was concluded that no detectable contamination has occurred...|$|E
