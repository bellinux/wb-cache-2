5|$|According to {{the medieval}} chronicler Geoffrey Gaimar, after the Battle of Stamford Bridge Harold {{entrusted}} the loot gained from Harold Hardrada to Ealdred. Gaimar asserts that King Harold did {{this because he}} had heard of Duke William's landing in England, and needed to rush south to counter <b>it.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Hastings, Ealdred joined the group who tried to elevate Edgar the Ætheling, Edward the Exile's son, as king, but eventually he submitted to William the Conqueror at Berkhamsted. John of Worcester says that the group supporting Edgar vacillated {{over what to do}} while William ravaged the countryside, which led to Ealdred and Edgar's submission to William.|$|E

5|$|Delivered to the United States Army Air Forces on 19 March 1945, Bockscar was {{assigned}} to Captain Frederick C. Bock and crew C-13, and flown to Wendover Army Air Field, Utah in April. The name chosen for the aircraft, and painted on <b>it</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> mission, was a pun on {{the name of the}} aircraft commander. It left Wendover on 11 June 1945 for Tinian, where it arrived 16 June. It was originally given the Victor (unit-assigned identification) number 7 but on 1 August was given the triangle N tail markings of the 444th Bombardment Group as a security measure, and had its Victor changed to 77 to avoid misidentification with an actual 444th aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Due to the missed field goal, Air Force {{took over}} from {{the point at which}} the kick was missed, the 27-yard line.

Tech declined to return the ball, which rolled to the Virginia Tech three-yard line, where the Hokies' offense took over. On the first play after the punt, Tech's Nigel Bowe fumbled the ball, which was leapt upon by several Air Force defenders, who recovered <b>it.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> fumble recovery, it took the Falcons just one play to score a touchdown and gain a 107 lead.|$|E
