Therefore, more and more attention is paid on experimental research of the basalt fiber in the world. Firstly, according to the type selection principles and requirements of the fibers used in the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>concrete,</b> the contrast testing of the plastic shrinkage between fiber cement mortar and pure mortar is made. The experimental results showed that basalt fiber, polypropylene fiber and polyacrylonitrile fiber can be preliminarily chosen as reinforced fibers in high performance <b>hydraulic</b> <b>concrete.</b> Secondly, the impacts of the suggested three sorts of fibers on the interfacial shear stress of the fiber concrete are analyzed by numerical simulation，which showed that maximum interfacial shear stress of the basalt fiber concrete is minimum. So, the bond strength between basalt fiber and concrete is the best. Finally, taking both characteristics of basalt fiber and the increase of concrete costs into account, {{it can be concluded}} that top priority should be given to the basalt fiber rather than to other fibers for high performance <b>hydraulic</b> <b>concrete...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Controlling {{crack of}} {{hyperbolic}} arch dam with {{a height of}} 305 m in Jinping hydropower station is an important problem. To improve the anti-cracking ability and reduce cracking risk of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>concrete,</b> polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fiber and polypropylene thick fiber were used in <b>hydraulic</b> <b>concrete</b> using four gradations of aggregates. Indoor and productive tests were carried through to comparatively analyze workability, physical and mechanical properties and anti-cracking ability.

When two kinds of fiber were used in concrete, the anti-cracking ability was greatly enhanced with lower elastic modulus-to-strength ratio and lager ultimate tensile strain.

40|$|Purpose. Scientific work aims at the {{development}} and testing of information system {{to meet the challenges}} of concrete composition design and control (for railway structures and buildings) based on the physico-analytical method algorithm for <b>hydraulic</b> <b>concrete</b> composition calculation. Methodology. The proposed algorithm of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>concrete</b> composition calculation is based on the physicochemical mechanics and in particular on the rheology of elastic–viscous–plastic bodies. The system of canonical equations consists of the equations for concrete strength, absolute volume, concrete mix consistency as well as the equation for optimal concrete saturation with aggregates while minimizing cement content. The joint solution of these four equations related to composition allows determining for the materials the concrete composition of required strength, concrete workability with minimum cement content. The procedure for calculation of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>concrete</b> composition according to the physico-analytical method consists of two parts: 1) physical, which is laboratory testing of concrete mix components in different concrete compositions; 2) analytical, which represents the calculation algorithm for concrete compositions equivalent in concrete strength and workability that comply with the specific conditions of concrete placing. Findings. To solve the problem of designing the concrete composition with the desired properties for railway structures and buildings it was proposed to use the information technology in the form of a developed computer program whose algorithm includes the physico-analytical method for <b>hydraulic</b> <b>concrete</b> composition determination. Originality. The developed concrete composition design method takes into account the basic properties of raw materials, concrete mix and concrete, which are pre-determined. The distinctive feature of physico-analytical method is obtaining of a set of equivalent compositions with a certain concrete mix consistency and required concrete strength, which allows to optimize the concrete composition by any optimality criterion, depending on the operation conditions. Practical value. Using the developed method will expand its functionality when applied in the form of the composition calculation computer program for the construction and repair of surface and underwater structures. The use of physico-analytical method at production site will simultaneously solve the economic problems of construction and maintenance cost reduction, component saving and ensure obtaining the concrete with the set properties for specific operation conditions of transport engineering structures...|$|R

40|$|Environmental {{pollution}} {{caused by}} solid wastes is increasing {{in the last}} decades; {{one of these is}} referred to automotive tires, which are recycled by different methods, including mechanical grinding. One of the most recurrent applications is to use recycled particles as fillers in building materials, as <b>hydraulic</b> <b>concrete.</b> Nevertheless, detrimental values on the mechanical properties are obtained when they are added. For solving these problems, in this work, a novel proposal is to modify the physicochemical properties of the waste automotive tire particles, previously obtained by grinding process, by using gamma irradiation in order to use them as reinforcements of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>concrete.</b> The results show that improvements on the mechanical properties depend of gamma irradiation as well as concentration and size of waste tire particles. Moreover, SEM images are related to mechanical properties; for instance, rough surface of the tire particles changes when applying irradiation; more smooth surfaces are created, due to the cross-linking of polymer chains. Nevertheless, for higher doses, cracks are observed which are produced by scission of the polymer chains...|$|R

40|$|Objectives To {{determine}} the extent of hand transmitted vibration exposure problems, particularly hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS), among construction workers in Malaysia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on a construction site in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 243 workers were recruited. Questionnaire interviews and hand examinations were administered to 194 respondents. Vibration magnitudes for <b>concrete</b> <b>breakers,</b> drills and grinders were measured using a 3 -axis accelerometer. Clinical outcomes were compared and analysed according to vibration exposure status. Results Vibration total values for <b>concrete</b> <b>breakers,</b> impact drills and grinders were 10. 02 ms(- 2), 7. 72 ms(- 2) and 5. 29 ms(- 2), respectively. The mean 8 h time-weighted hand transmitted vibration exposure, A(8), among subjects on current and previous construction sites was 7. 52 (SD 2. 68) ms(- 2) and 9. 21 (SD 2. 48) ms(- 2), respectively. Finger tingling, finger numbness, musculoskeletal problems of the neck, finger coldness, abnormal Phalen's test and abnormal light touch sensation were significantly more common in the high vibration exposure group (n= 139) than the low-moderate vibration exposure group (n= 54). Mean total lifetime vibration dose among exposed subjects was 15. 2 (SD 3. 2) m(2) h(3) s(- 4) (In scale). HAVS prevalence was 18 and the prevalence ratio of stage 1 and higher disease in the high vibration exposure group versus the low-moderate vibration exposure group was 4. 86 (95 CI 1. 19 to 19. 80).
