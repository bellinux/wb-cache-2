60|$|Twenty {{minutes later}} Geoffrey stood among the {{boulders}} that the shrunken river had left exposed near {{the foot of}} a giant cliff which, instead of overhanging, thrust forward a slanting spur into the rush of water, and so formed a bend. It {{was one of the main}} obstacles Geoffrey, who wondered at the formation, had determined to remove by the simultaneous shock of several heavy blasting charges. To that end a gang of men had long been drilling deep holes into the projecting spur, and on the preceding day charges of high explosives had been sunk in most of them with <b>detonators</b> <b>and</b> <b>fuses</b> ready coupled for connection to the igniting gear. Geoffrey stood upon a boulder and looked up at the tremendous face of rock which, rising above the spur, held up the hill slope above. The stratification was looser than usual, and several mighty masses had fallen from it into the river. There were also crannies at its feet.|$|E

60|$|For a year Mauki toiled on. Then he {{was made}} a house-boy, and had good food and easy times, with light work in keeping the house clean and serving the white men with whiskey and beer {{at all hours of}} the day and most hours of the night. He liked it, but he liked Port Adams more. He had two years longer to serve, but two years were too long for him in the throes of homesickness. He had grown wiser with his year of service, and, being now a house-boy, he had opportunity. He had the {{cleaning}} of the rifles, and he knew where the key to the store room was hung. He planned to escape, and one night ten Malaita boys and one boy from San Cristoval sneaked from the barracks and dragged one of the whale boats down to the beach. It was Mauki who supplied the key that opened the padlock on the boat, and it was Mauki who equipped the boat with a dozen Winchesters, an immense amount of ammunition, a case of dynamite with <b>detonators</b> <b>and</b> <b>fuse,</b> <b>and</b> ten cases of tobacco.|$|R
40|$|Explosives and its {{accessories}} are {{the cheapest}} {{source of energy}} to excavate the rock for mining industry. On detonation, explosives and blasting accessories produce various types of energy like shock, gas, light, heat, sound, seismic etc,. A good energy product enhances the production and productivity of the mine. It has been experienced that the open pit mining operations are feasible up to 90 m depth and below this it is neither economical nor technically convenient. Therefore, {{it is essential to}} dig out the coal through underground mining operations below this depth to fulfill the demand of power. An underground coal-mine contains methane air mixture and coal dust which are highly inflammable in nature. During blasting they may ignite and causes accidents. Every year, in India and abroad many accidents occur in underground coal mines during the firing of explosive and its accessories. The flame characteristics and detonation temperature of explosives and its accessories are mainly responsible for the ignition of methane air mixture and coal dust. In this paper authors have studied the under water blasting energy and flame characteristics of <b>detonators</b> <b>and</b> detonating <b>fuse</b> which are used in underground mining operation, in detail...|$|R
60|$|It {{suddenly}} recurred to {{my memory}} that I {{had left a}} compound in my laboratory {{at home in a}} state of chemical preparation, which required watching to prevent its catching fire at a certain part of the process. I had been called away from that compound suddenly by Nicholas, just before we left for London, and I had been so taken up with what he had to tell me, that I had totally forgotten it. The mere burning of this compound would, in itself, have been nothing, for my laboratory was an old out-house, quite unconnected with the dwelling; but in the laboratory also lay my torpedo! The worst of it was that I had inserted a <b>detonator</b> <b>and</b> affixed a <b>fuse,</b> feeling quite secure in doing so, because I invariably locked the door and carried the key in my pocket.|$|R

50|$|The NR-413 is a Belgian {{trip wire}} {{activated}} anti-personnel stake mine.

Under the fuse well is a <b>detonator</b> <b>and</b> a row of booster pellets. Wrapped around the <b>detonator</b> <b>and</b> booster pellets is the main charge. An internally square cross-sectioned steel wire is coiled around the outside of the mine, which give a fragmentation effect. The mine produces 600 fragments with a velocity of approximately 1,660 metres per second. It has an effective range of around 15 metres. A variant is produced with a cast steel fragmentation jacket.|$|R
