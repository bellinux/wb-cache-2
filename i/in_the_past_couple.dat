25|$|Most of the {{synthesis}} in evo-devo {{has been in}} the field of animal evolution, one reason being the presence of elegant model systems like Drosophila melanogaster, C. elegans, zebrafish and Xenopus laevis.

25|$|Ethnic Russians {{represent}} a significant {{deviation from the}} pattern, with second lowest fertility rate of all major groups, but relatively low median age (37.6 years). This phenomenon is at least {{partly due to the}} fact that children from mixed marriages are often registered as ethnic Russians in the census. The most noticeable trend <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> of decades is the convergence of birth rates between minorities (including Muslim minorities) and the Russian majority.|$|E
30|$|In this context, {{national}} governments {{can influence the}} distribution of earnings. This could {{take the form of}} enhanced minimum wage legislation, to tackle the problem of “in work poverty”. It could be a lighter touch exercise of moral suasion, as in some incomes policies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>coupled</b> with publicity concerning the extent of pay differentials. In between, in degree of intervention, would be the use of government purchasing power to insist on fair pay practices by private contractors, coupled with the active use of shareholdings in companies part or wholly owned by the state.|$|R
40|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>coupling</b> {{capacitances}} between conductors was extracted using charge distributions directly. In {{this paper}} {{a set of}} new generalized variational formulas are derived. They are complete since they are valid not only for self-capacitances, but also for mutual capacitances. As for the realistic numerical implementation, elastance matrices become asymmetrical because of numerical method used. Then a more general variational formula is derived {{to account for the}} asymmetrical elastance matrix case. By these novel formulas the computational accuracy can be significantly improved compared to the conventional capacitance extraction method. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
30|$|Consistency {{is related}} to {{transactions}} and, although not universally defined, {{can be seen as}} the guarantee that transactions started <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future see the effects of transactions committed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>coupled</b> with <b>the</b> insurance of database constraints [73 – 75]. It is useful to recall that, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of the CAP theorem [40, 41], consistency is often seen as the premise that all nodes see the same data at the same time [42] (i.e., the CAP version of consistency is merely a subset of the ACID version of the same property [41]). We have previously seen that consistency and availability are highly related properties of NoSQL systems.|$|R
25|$|The {{structural}} {{economic changes}} have influenced {{specific aspects of}} the family. However, not all families are affected in the same way. In the U.S., {{whether or not a}} family is dual or single-earner is related to their social class and income. The economic changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> of decades have affected middle-class and lower-class families very differently in many aspects, especially since the 1970s economic recession. These family inequalities significantly affect the intersection of Race (United States Census) and Social class in the United States as well.|$|E
25|$|Another {{influential}} {{factor is}} oil revenues. Historically, in periods of {{high oil prices}} and the consequent petrodollar windfall, imports accelerate rapidly in virtually all consumption categories including agricultural products. This, in turn, results in crowding out domestic production and damage to the agriculture sector. After the oil price spikes following 1973, agricultural imports also increased dramatically and caused significant damage to domestic production. Between 1970 and 1976, agricultural imports grew at the staggering annual rate of 35%. This experience was repeated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> of years when oil prices were at or over $100 per barrel; {{the result is that}} agricultural imports have increased at a rapid pace and foreign products now form a sizeable chunk of the household consumption basket. Over the past few years, there have been significant price increases in agricultural products in Iran. This is due both to rising domestic demand and to rising global commodity prices.|$|E

Things tend to hurtle toward the screen anyway". In January 2012, it was reported that the film would be digitally remastered for IMAX 3D and open in IMAX theaters on May 4, 2012, the same day it opens in regular theaters. The film's IMAX release follows Marvel's IMAX releases of Iron Man 2 and Thor.|$|E

40|$|To {{study the}} {{mechanical}} {{behavior of the}} vocal folds, lumped parameter models of the vocal folds have been developed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> <b>Coupling</b> with a model of <b>the</b> aerodynamics <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glottis provides the possibility of simulating glottal waves. A new method is presented to obtain values for the masses and springs of the lumped parameter models by using a finite-element method model of the vocal folds. This finite-element method model is based on geometry and material data from <b>the</b> literature, resulting <b>in</b> a model that describes <b>the</b> vocal fold <b>in</b> a realistic way. Requiring the dynamic behavior of the lumped parameter model of the vocal fold to be equal to the dynamic behavior of the finite-element method model of the vocal fold, parameter values are obtained that are purely based on dynamic considerations. Therefore, {{the behavior of the}} vocal folds is described in a realistic way by these parameters. These values are compared with the values used by previous authors and are implemented in lumped parameter models. Self-sustained oscillation is achieved with the new values for masses and springs.

This thesis work has focused on developing novel strategies based on enzyme immobilization to design nano-carriers for multi-enzyme co-localization to realize kinetics enhancement and strong control of spatial arrangement of the enzymes. Three distinct approaches have been designed using different attachment methods and platforms. First, the multifunctional polystyrene nanoparticles were designed for immobilization and sequential co-localization of GOX and SHRP enzymes using covalent binding and streptavidin-biotin coupling attachment techniques. The sequentially co-localized GOX and SHRP on B/C-PS nanoparticles were capable of enhancing the overall conversion rate by approximately two-fold compared to the equivalent concentration of free enzymes in solution. Secondly, amphiphilic Pluronic-QD micelles were designed to co-localize multiple enzymes to investigate {{the effect of a}} more flexible substrate compared to the rigid polystyrene particles.
