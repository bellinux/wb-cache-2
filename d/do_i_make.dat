When speaking to Revolver, King was asked if there were any plans in place for the band to begin working on the album, he said, [...] "Funny thing is, Repentless isn't even two years old yet, though it seems like it is. But from that session, there are six or eight songs that are recorded — some with vocals, some with leads, but all with keeper guitar, drums and bass. So when those songs get finished lyrically, if the lyrics don't change the songs, they'll be ready to be on the next record. So we already have more than half a record complete, if those songs make it." [...] He also gave conceivable consideration that it could be released next year, [...] "I'm certainly not gonna promise it, because every time I <b>do,</b> <b>I</b> <b>make</b> a liar of myself! [...] " [...] When asked about any plans or the timeline the band would like to release the album, King said, [...] "It depends on touring — getting time to rehearse, getting time to make up new stuff. We haven't even done Australia on this run yet at all. We're hitting Japan finally later this year. But if things go well, I'd like to record next year. But timelines change all the time." [...] In an October 2017 interview, Holt once again expressed his desire to contribute to the songwriting for the next Slayer album, saying, [...] "When that time comes and we are ready for the next album, if Kerry wants me to contribute, I've got riffs. I've got stuff right now that I've written that I am not using for Exodus, because it was kind of maybe just unintentional subconscious thing, like, 'It sounds a little too Slayer.'" ...|$|E
