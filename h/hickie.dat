25|$|After {{failing to}} secure a {{high-profile}} coaching position in Ireland, O'Sullivan moved to America to coach the US Eagles where he worked as Forwards Coach at the 1999 Rugby World Cup He also worked as Technical Director to USA Rugby between 1997 and 1999. As Technical Director he developed and delivered the USA Rugby Coach Education Programme, which certifier coaches at Foundation, Level I, Level II and Level III. He was then appointed as the assistant coach of the Irish national side in 1999 as the Backs Coach. During his time as Assistant Coach he was credited with advancing Irish back play considerably while working with players such as Brian O'Driscoll, Ronan O'Gara, Peter Stringer, Rob Henderson, Shane Horgan and Denis <b>Hickie.</b> In 2001 he was appointed Head Coach following the controversial departure of Warren Gatland.|$|E
25|$|Redmond {{requested}} the War Office {{to allow the}} formation of a separate 'Irish Brigade' as had been done for the Ulster Volunteers, but Britain was suspicious of Redmond. His plan was that post-war the 'Irish Brigade' and National Volunteers would provide the basis for an Irish Army, capable of enforcing Home Rule on reluctant Ulster Unionists. Eventually he was granted the gesture of the 16th (Irish) Division which, with the exception of its Irish General Bernhard <b>Hickie</b> at first had mostly English officers, unlike the Ulster Division which had its own reserve militia officers, since most of the experienced officers in Ireland had already been posted to the 10th (Irish) Division and most Irish recruits enlisting in the new army lacked the military training to act as officers. Redmond's own son, William Redmond, enlisted, as did his own brother Major Willie Redmond MP, despite being aged over 50 years. They belonged to a group of five Irish MPs who enlisted, the others J. L. Esmonde, Stephen Gwynn, and D. D. Sheehan as well as former MP Tom Kettle.|$|E
60|$|From this {{incident}} {{until the end}} of the year nothing of importance occurred in this part of the seat of war, save for a sharp and well-managed action at Beestekraal upon October 29th, in which seventy-nine Boers were surrounded and captured by Kekewich's horsemen. The process of attrition went very steadily forwards, and each of the British columns returned its constant tale of prisoners. The blockhouse system had now been extended to such an extent that the Magaliesberg was securely held, and a line had been pushed through from Klerksdorp and Fredericstad to Ventersdorp. One of Colonel <b>Hickie's</b> Yeomanry patrols was roughly handled near Brakspruit upon November 13th, but with this exception the points scored were all upon one side. Methuen and Kekewich came across early in November from Zeerust to Klerksdorp, and operated from the railway line. The end of the year saw them both in the Wolmaranstad district, where they were gathering up prisoners and clearing the country.|$|R
60|$|The {{new year}} found the British {{connecting}} Ventersdorp with Tafelkop by a blockhouse line. The latter place {{had been a}} centre of Boer activity. Colonel <b>Hickie's</b> column covered this operation. Meanwhile Methuen had struck across through Wolmaranstad as far as Vryburg. In these operations, which resulted in constant small captures, he was assisted by a column under Major Paris working from Kimberley. From Vryburg Lord Methuen made his way {{in the middle of}} January to Lichtenburg, meeting with a small rebuff in the neighbourhood of that town, for a detachment of Yeomanry was overwhelmed by General Celliers, who killed eight, wounded fifteen, and captured forty. From Lichtenburg Lord Methuen continued his enormous trek, and arrived on February 1st at Klerksdorp once more. Little rest was given to his hard-worked troops, and they were sent off again within the week under the command of Von Donop, with the result that on February 8th, near Wolmaranstad, they captured Potgieter's laager with forty Boer prisoners. Von Donop remained at Wolmaranstad until late in February; On the 23rd he despatched an empty convoy back to Klerksdorp, the fate of which will be afterwards narrated.|$|R

2500|$|Unlike their 36th (Ulster) Division {{counterparts}} and the Ulster Volunteers who manned it {{with their}} own trained military reserve officers, the southern Volunteers possessed no officers with previous military experience {{with the result that}} the War Office had the 16th Division led by English officers, which [...] with the exception of Irish General William <b>Hickie,</b> {{and the fact that the}} division did not have its own specific uniforms, was an unpopular decision. The War Office also reacted with suspicion to Redmond’s remark that the Volunteers would soon return as an armed army to oppose Ulster’s resistance to Home Rule.|$|E
2500|$|With Askin's death, investigative {{journalists were}} {{freed from the}} threat of legal action under Australia's {{defamation}} laws. Stories about his reputed corruption were published almost immediately. The most notable of these was the article appeared in the National Times co-written by David Marr and David <b>Hickie,</b> headlined [...] "Askin: friend of organised crime", which was published on the day of Askin's funeral in 1981. This was followed by David Hickie's book [...] "The Prince and The Premier", which detailed Askin's long involvement in illegal bookmaking and allegations that he had received substantial and long-running payoffs from organised crime figures.|$|E
2500|$|Wilson {{spoke with}} an Irish accent {{and at times}} {{regarded}} himself as British, Irish or an Ulsterman. Like many Anglo-Irish or Scots of his era, he often referred to Britain as [...] "England." [...] He may well, like many Anglo-Irish, have played up his “Irishness” in England and regarded himself as more “Anglo-” whilst in Ireland, and may well also have agreed with his brother Jemmy that Ireland was not “homogenous” enough to be [...] "a Nation." [...] Wilson was also a devout member of the Church of Ireland, which evolved a distinctive Irish and Low Church identity after Disestablishment in 1869. Wilson was not an Orangeman, and did on occasion attend Roman Catholic services, but disliked “Romish” ritual, especially when practised by Anglican clergymen. He enjoyed good personal relations with Catholics, although there are unsubstantiated claims that he disliked George MacDonogh, and tried to block the promotion of William <b>Hickie,</b> as both men were Catholics.|$|E
2500|$|Cuthbert {{remained}} {{in command of}} 13th Brigade when it was mobilised for service in the British Expeditionary Force after the First World War began in August 1914. He took the brigade to France and commanded it through the Retreat from Mons, the First Battle of the Marne and the First Battle of the Aisne. [...] He {{was sent back to}} England at the end of September and placed on [...] "invalid" [...] status. [...] He was succeeded by William <b>Hickie.</b> On 26 November, Cuthbert was appointed to take command of a Territorial unit; this was the 140th Infantry Brigade, which he had commanded in its peacetime incarnation as the 4th London Brigade, of the 47th (2nd London) Division. He remained with them through 1915 and 1916, culminating in the German attack on Vimy Ridge in May 1916, where Cuthbert led the division in lieu of the divisional commander, who was on leave. He was not a popular brigadier; the London volunteers particularly objected to his strict views on cleanliness, a story circulated that he had ordered front-line trenches to be swept out with brooms. He was nicknamed [...] "Spit and Polish" [...] by the infantry {{as a result of his}} obsession with appearances, alongside his earlier nickname of [...] "Bluebell", which may have been a reference to a brand of polish.|$|E
60|$|Kekewich and <b>Hickie</b> had {{combined}} {{their forces}} {{at the beginning}} of February. On February 4th an attempt was made by them to surprise General De la Rey. The mounted troops who were despatched under Major Leader failed in this enterprise, but they found and overwhelmed the laager of Sarel Alberts, capturing 132 prisoners. By stampeding the horses the Boer retreat was cut off, and the attack was so furiously driven home, especially by the admirable Scottish Horse, that few of the enemy got away. Alberts himself with all his officers were among the prisoners. From this time until the end of February this column was not seriously engaged.|$|E
60|$|Le Gallais, {{with his}} men, had come up, but the British force was still far {{inferior}} {{to that which}} it was attacking. A section of U battery was able to unlimber, and open fire at four {{hundred yards from the}} Boer position. The British made no attempt to attack, but contented themselves with holding on to the position from which they could prevent the Boer guns from being removed. The burghers tried desperately to drive off the stubborn fringe of riflemen. A small stone shed in the possession of the British was the centre of the Boer fire, and it was within its walls that Ross of the Durhams was horribly wounded by an explosive ball, and that the brave Jerseyman, Le Gallais, was killed. Before his fall he had despatched his staff officer, Major <b>Hickie,</b> to hurry up men from the rear.|$|E
