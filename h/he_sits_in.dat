2500|$|To {{prepare for}} a scrum, each team's eight {{forwards}} (referred to as the pack or forward pack) bind together in three rows [...] the front row, second row and back row. The front row is composed of the two props and the hooker. To the left is the loosehead prop with the hooker in the middle, and the tighthead prop on the right (jersey numbers one, two and three). The [...] "tighthead" [...] prop, number three, earns that name as his head and shoulders sits between the hooker and the loosehead prop of the opposing side, meaning <b>he</b> <b>sits</b> <b>in</b> a [...] "tighter" [...] scrum position. The loosehead prop, by contrast, has one shoulder open {{to the outside of}} the scrum, and so is in a [...] "looser" [...] scrum position. The three bind together tightly and there is no gap between the hooker and either prop. According to the laws of the game; [...] "When a player binds on a team-mate that player must use the whole arm from hand to shoulder to grasp the team-mate’s body at or below the level of the armpit." [...] Failing to bind properly results in a penalty, and the opposition team being awarded a free kick.|$|E
