25|$|Tom Ridge: I’m {{familiar}} with his claims. I’m not {{familiar with}} how accurate they are. This is a global scourge. It’s really a case of first impression for everybody. As {{secretary of homeland security}} after 9/11, I <b>dare</b> <b>say</b> America was confronted with a set of challenges it had never seen before and we acted with what we thought was in the best interest for securing America. We also looked back at what we did and made some adjustments. I’ll just leave it at that. We can kill bin Laden and eliminate a lot of these other extremists, but that whole belief system is out there. It doesn’t take too many people to buy in to it to cause enormous damage.|$|E
500|$|When Wellington and the Tories {{fell from}} power in November 1830, Arbuthnot lost {{interest}} in her diary, writing: [...] "I shall write very seldom now, I <b>dare</b> <b>say,</b> in my book, for, except the Duke, none of the public men interest me." [...] Her account of the break-up of the Tory party is a thoroughly partisan narration, accurate as to happenings outside the Tory inner circle, but on a broader scale and not so completely political as that of Henry Hobhouse.|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} years of marriage, they experimented with {{automatic}} writing; she contacted a variety of spirits and guides they called [...] "Instructors" [...] while in a trance. The spirits communicated a complex and esoteric system of philosophy and history, which the couple developed into an exposition using geometrical shapes: phases, cones, and gyres. Yeats devoted much time to preparing this material for publication as A Vision (1925). In 1924, he wrote to his publisher T. Werner Laurie admitting: [...] "I <b>dare</b> <b>say</b> I delude myself in thinking this book my book of books".|$|E

500|$|The trip to America is approaching. [...] {{is not yet}} complete. Terrible haste... {{the score}} is only half-ready. The copyist, Mr. Kauppi, is staying with us and writing night and day... It is only because of Janne's [...] energy that we are making progress... We lit a lamp in the dining room, a {{chandelier}} in the living room, it was a festive moment. I didn't <b>dare</b> <b>say</b> a word. I just checked that the environment was in order. Then I went to bed and Janne stayed up. All night long I could hear his footsteps, alternating with music played quietly.|$|E
500|$|As {{the smoke}} cleared, the Prussian {{infantry}} reformed its lines, preparing {{to pursue the}} fleeing Austrians. Snow began to fall and Frederick halted the pursuit. A few soldiers, perhaps only one, started to sing the well-known chorale, Nun danket alle Gott (Now Thank We All Our God); eventually the entire army may have joined in the song, although this story is likely apocryphal. Frederick pushed toward Lissa. Refugees from the battle had filled the town, and he found {{the courtyard of the}} local castle crowded with startled Austrian officers. Reportedly, after he dismounted, he addressed them politely, [...] "Good evening, Gentlemen, I <b>dare</b> <b>say</b> you did not expect me here. [...] Can one get a night's lodging along with you?" ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the debate}} on Howe's war {{spending}} estimates in 1945 (which totalled $1.365billion), Howe answered an Opposition question on whether such a large sum could be reduced: [...] "I <b>dare</b> <b>say</b> my honourable friend could cut a million dollars from that amount, but a million dollars from the War Appropriations Bill {{would not be a}} very important matter." [...] Saskatchewan Tory MP John Diefenbaker spoke the following day, and alleged that Howe had said, [...] "We may save a million dollars, but what of it?" [...] Howe angrily denied the quote, accusing Diefenbaker of being [...] "a past master of distortion"—language he was forced to withdraw as unparliamentary. Diefenbaker sharpened the anecdote over time, and it emerged in its final form as Howe saying, [...] "What's a million?" [...] Even Liberals who knew that Howe had made no such statement agreed that it was just the sort of thing he could have said. [...] In the years to come, [...] "What's a million?" [...] would be a mocking Tory attack on the Liberals, most often directed at Howe.|$|E

500|$|During {{the second}} half of the series, Toriyama has said that he had become more {{interested}} in coming up with the story than actually drawing it, and that the battles became more intense with him simplifying the lines. In 2013, he stated that because Dragon Ball is an action manga the most important aspect is the sense of speed, so he did not draw very elaborate, going so far as to suggest one could say that he was not interested in the art. He also once said that his goal for the series was to tell an [...] "unconventional and contradictory" [...] story. In 2013, commenting on Dragon Balls global success, Toriyama said, [...] "Frankly, I don't quite understand why it happened. While the manga was being serialized, the only thing I wanted as I kept drawing was to make Japanese boys happy.", [...] "The role of my manga is to be a work of entertainment through and through. I <b>dare</b> <b>say</b> I don't care even if [...] have left nothing behind, as long as they have entertained their readers." ...|$|E
500|$|When Dragon Ball began, it was {{loosely based}} on the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West, with Goku being Sun Wukong and Bulma as Xuanzang. Toriyama {{continued}} to use his characteristic comedic style in the beginning, but {{over the course of}} time this slowly changed, with him turning the series into a [...] "nearly-pure fighting manga" [...] later on. He did not plan out in advance what would happen in the series, instead choosing to draw as he went. This, coupled with him simply forgetting things he had already drawn, caused him to find himself in situations that he had to write himself out of. In a rare 2013 interview, commenting on Dragon Balls global success, Toriyama admitted, [...] "Frankly, I don't quite understand why it happened. While the manga was being serialized, the only thing I wanted as I kept drawing was to make Japanese boys happy." [...] Speaking of his manga in general, he said, [...] "The role of my manga is to be a work of entertainment through and through. I <b>dare</b> <b>say</b> I don't care even if [...] have left nothing behind, {{as long as they have}} entertained their readers." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2011, manga {{critic and}} editor of Viz's editions of the series Jason Thompson said that: [...] "Dragon Ball {{is by far the}} most {{influential}} shonen manga of the last 30 years, and today, almost every Shōnen Jump artist lists it as one of their favorites and lifts from it in various ways." [...] Explaining its basic formula of [...] "lots of martial arts, lots of training sequences, [...] a few jokes" [...] became the model for other shōnen series, such as Naruto. Thompson cited the artwork as influential, pointing out that popular shōnen manga of the late 1980s and early 1990s had [...] "manly" [...] heroes, such as City Hunter and Fist of the North Star, whereas Dragon Ball had the cartoonish and small Goku, thus starting a trend that he says still continues. Commenting on Dragon Balls global success nearly two decades after it ended, Toriyama said, [...] "Frankly, I don't quite understand why it happened. While the manga was being serialized, the only thing I wanted as I kept drawing was to make Japanese boys happy. The role of my manga is to be a work of entertainment through and through. I <b>dare</b> <b>say</b> I don't care even if [...] have left nothing behind, as long as they have entertained their readers." ...|$|E

'I <b>dare</b> <b>say</b> it's reprehensible, but there it is.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{national}} syndicalist journalist Émile Janvion {{published an}} undated pamphlet, probably in late 1917, titled Le féminisme défaitiste (Defeatist Feminism). He identified pro-peace feminist {{leaders such as}} Hélène Brion, Séverine, Marguerite Durand, Hubertine Auclert and Nelly Roussel, and wrote, [...] "the history of defeatism, when it is known, will demonstrate superabundantly that feminism will there merit, I <b>dare</b> <b>say,</b> the place of honor." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{his article}} series House of 1000 Manga for the Anime News Network (ANN) Jason Thompson wrote that [...] "Nausicaa is as grim as Grave of the Fireflies [...] ". Mike Crandol of ANN praised the manga stating, [...] "I <b>dare</b> <b>say</b> the manga is Hayao Miyazaki's finest work ever--animated, printed, or otherwise--and that's saying a lot. Manga {{allows for a}} depth of plot and {{character}} unattainable in the cinematic medium, and Miyazaki uses it to its fullest potential." ...|$|E
2500|$|DeathSpank: Thongs of Virtues humor, visual {{design and}} voice acting {{generally}} received praise, with some exceptions. Kristan Reed of Eurogamer felt that [...] "the poop gags [...] a little wearisome" [...] but added [...] "a sprinkling {{of the old}} Gilbert magic makes it a worthwhile ride." [...] In comparison to DeathSpank, IGN's Hatfield felt that Thongs of Virtue was [...] "addictive, just as pretty, and I <b>dare</b> <b>say</b> it's even a little funnier." [...] Ryan Vincent from GameZone thought the game's new setting gave the game [...] "far more charm and personality than the first DeathSpank." ...|$|E
2500|$|He had {{a special}} penchant for royal ladies, and noted that his {{favourite}} amours (apart from his wife) were Lakshmibai, Ci Xi and Lola Montez: [...] "a Queen, an Empress, and the foremost courtesan of her time: I <b>dare</b> <b>say</b> I'm just a snob." [...] He also noted that, while civilized women were more than ordinarily partial to him, his most ardent admirers were among the savage of the species: [...] "Elspeth, of course, is Scottish." [...] And for all his raking, it was always Elspeth to whom he returned and who remained ultimately top of the list.|$|E

2500|$|In March 2014, Lithuanian {{ambassador}} to the United States, [...] {{said in an interview}} for the LRT TV programme Savaitė, that after the Russo-Georgian War everyone in Brussels [...] "laughed about Lithuania's position". He said that [...] "... at that time, the Western world forgot and forgave Russia for what it did in Georgia – occupied a large part of its territory, and is still keeping it." [...] In July 2014, Žygimantas Pavilionis said that when Russia occupied the Georgian territories, [...] "... Lithuanian diplomats were the only ones in Europe and, I <b>dare</b> <b>say,</b> in Lithuania who constantly tried to defend a free Georgia to the end." ...|$|E
2500|$|Herzen was disliked by Russian {{radicals}} as too moderate. Radicals such as Nikolai Chernyshevsky and Nikolay Dobrolyubov {{wanted more}} commitment towards violent revolution from Herzen and {{the withdrawal of}} any hope in the reformist Tsar. Radicals asked Herzen to use The Bell as a mouthpiece for violent radical revolution, but Herzen rejected these requests. He argued that the Russian Radicals were not united and strong enough to seek successful political change, stating, [...] "You want happiness, I suppose? I <b>dare</b> <b>say</b> you do! Happiness has to be conquered. If you are strong, take it. If you are weak, hold your tongue". Herzen feared a new revolutionary government would merely replace the dictatorship with another dictatorship.|$|E
2500|$|Vita's first {{close friend}} was Rosamund Grosvenor (5 September 1888 – 30 June 1944), who {{was four years}} her senior. Rosamund was the {{daughter}} of Algernon Henry Grosvenor (1864–1907), and the granddaughter of Robert Grosvenor, 1st Baron Ebury. Vita met Rosamund at Miss Woolf's school in 1899, when Rosamund had been invited to cheer Vita up while her father was fighting in the Second Boer War. Rosamund and Vita later shared a governess for their morning lessons. As they grew up together, Vita fell in love with Rosamund, whom she called 'Roddie' or 'Rose' or 'the Rubens lady'. Rosamund, in turn, was besotted with Vita. [...] "Oh, I <b>dare</b> <b>say</b> I realized vaguely that I had no business to sleep with Rosamund, and I should certainly never have allowed anyone to find it out," [...] she admits in her journal, but she saw no real conflict: [...] "I really was innocent." ...|$|E
