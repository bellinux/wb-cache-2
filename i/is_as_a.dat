5|$|An {{exploding}} cigar is {{a variety}} of cigar that explodes shortly after being lit. Such cigars are normally packed with a minute chemical explosive charge near the lighting end or with a non-chemical device that ruptures the cigar when exposed to heat. The customary intended purpose of exploding cigars <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> form of hostile practical joke, rather than to cause lasting physical harm to {{the butt of the}} joke. Nevertheless, the high risk of unintended injuries from their use caused a decline in their manufacture and sale.|$|E
5|$|Another {{function}} of this coenzyme in cell signaling <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> precursor of cyclic ADP-ribose, which is produced from NAD by ADP-ribosyl cyclases, {{as part of}} a second messenger system. This molecule acts in calcium signaling by releasing calcium from intracellular stores. It does this by binding to and opening a class of calcium channels called ryanodine receptors, which are located in the membranes of organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum.|$|E

5|$|His first {{mainstream}} {{success was}} the 1976 album Oxygène. Recorded {{in a makeshift}} studio at his home, the album sold an estimated 12million copies. Oxygène was followed in 1978 by Équinoxe, and in 1979, Jarre performed to a record-breaking audience {{of more than a}} million people at the Place de la Concorde, a record he has since broken three times. More albums were to follow, but his 1979 concert served as a blueprint for his future performances around the world. Several of his albums have been released to coincide with large-scale outdoor events, and he is now perhaps as well known as a performer as he <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> musician.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the roles}} and {{importance}} of {{the various forms of}} vitamin E are presently unclear, and it has even been suggested that the most important function of α-tocopherol <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> signaling molecule, with this molecule having no significant role in antioxidant metabolism. The functions of the other forms of vitamin E are even less well understood, although γ-tocopherol is a nucleophile that may react with electrophilic mutagens, and tocotrienols may be important in protecting neurons from damage.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, {{the first}} segment of Route55 opened between Maurice River Township and the Vineland-Millville border, {{connecting}} to Route47 at both ends. In the 1970s, the planned northern terminus of Route55 {{was moved to}} Route42 in Deptford. The portion of Route55 between Route47 in Millville and US40 in Franklin Township was completed in the mid-1970s while the portion between US40 and Route42 was completed in October 1989. The Route55 freeway {{has been instrumental in}} bringing economic development to southern New Jersey. The most common use of the highway <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> commuting route northward to Philadelphia. Following its completion, residential development {{in the southern part of}} Gloucester County has increased.|$|E

5|$|McLean's favoured {{position}} <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> central midfielder, but he {{can also}} play as a left midfielder. He {{has said that he}} favours playing in the centre because he can get more of the ball and influence play more than when he is on the left. He is a naturally attacking player and when playing in the centre he makes runs to and beyond the striker which adds an extra dimension to his team's play.|$|E

5|$|Since {{both the}} {{oxidized}} and reduced forms of {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide}} are used in these linked sets of reactions, the cell maintains significant concentrations of both NAD and NADH, with the high NAD/NADH ratio allowing this coenzyme to act as both an oxidizing and a reducing agent. In contrast, the main function of NADPH <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> reducing agent in anabolism, with this coenzyme being involved in pathways such as fatty acid synthesis and photosynthesis. Since NADPH is needed to drive redox reactions as a strong reducing agent, the NADP/NADPH ratio is kept very low.|$|E
5|$|The main {{damage done}} by mole crickets <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of their {{burrowing}} activities. As they tunnel through the top few centimetres of soil they push the ground up in little ridges, increasing evaporation of surface moisture, disturbing germinating seeds and damaging the delicate young roots of seedlings. They are also injurious to turf- and pasture-grasses as they feed on {{the roots of the}} grasses, leaving the plants prone to drying-out and damage by use.|$|E

5|$|The main {{use for the}} agung in Maguindanao and Maranao society <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> supportive/accompanying {{instrument}} of an orthodox kulintang ensemble. Using basic patterns and interlocking rhythms, a player would use the agung to complement the melody played by the kulintang. The patterns players use are normally considered freer than either the babendil or the dabakan; players could manipulate the patterns freely {{as long as they}} conform, reaffirm, reinforce and even generate the rhythmic mode of the piece. The length of the patterns themselves may vary depending on how they fit into the melodic improvisation. Rapid style is useful especially during exhibition of playing skills.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} role of molybdenum in living organisms <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> metal heteroatom at the active site in certain enzymes. In bacterial nitrogen fixation, the nitrogenase enzyme involved in the terminal step of reducing molecular nitrogen usually contains molybdenum in the active site (though replacement of molybdenum with iron or vanadium is also known). The structure of the catalytic center of the enzyme {{is similar to that}} in iron-sulfur proteins: it incorporates a Fe4S3 and multiple MoFe3S3 clusters.|$|E
5|$|Today, some cobalt is {{produced}} specifically from various metallic-lustered ores, for example cobaltite (CoAsS), {{but the main}} source of the element <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> by-product of copper and nickel mining.

5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Æthelwold's {{immediate}} family. Æthelred was born in about 848 and died in 871, so his sons must have been young children when he died. Æthelred's wife was probably the Wulfthryth who witnessed a charter in 868. Æthelwold {{and his older brother}} Æthelhelm are first recorded in King Alfred's will in the 880s. Æthelhelm is not heard of again, and he probably died soon afterwards. The only other record of Æthelwold before Alfred's death <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> witness to a charter that probably dates to the 890s.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} episode concerns mutilations {{that the}} combatants inflict upon each other: Horus injures or steals Set's testicles and Set damages or tears out one, or occasionally both, of Horus's eyes. Sometimes {{the eye is}} torn into pieces. Set's mutilation signifies a loss of virility and strength. The removal of Horus's eye is even more important, for this stolen Eye of Horus represents {{a wide variety of}} concepts in Egyptian religion. One of Horus's major roles <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sky deity, and for this reason his right eye was said to be the sun and his left eye the moon. The theft or destruction of the Eye of Horus is therefore equated with the darkening of the moon in the course of its cycle of phases, or during eclipses. Horus may take back his lost Eye, or other deities, including Isis, Thoth, and Hathor, may retrieve or heal it for him. The Egyptologist Herman te Velde argues that the tradition about the lost testicles is a late variation on Set's loss of semen to Horus, and that the moon-like disk that emerges from Set's head after his impregnation is the Eye of Horus. If so, the episodes of mutilation and sexual abuse would form a single story, in which Set assaults Horus and loses semen to him, Horus retaliates and impregnates Set, and Set comes into possession of Horus's Eye when it appears on Set's head. Because Thoth is a moon deity in addition to his other functions, it would make sense, according to te Velde, for Thoth to emerge {{in the form of the}} Eye and step in to mediate between the feuding deities.|$|E
