25|$|For each year, Miller {{wrote about}} ten {{or more of}} his {{favorite}} songs, providing analytical insights and placing the songs in context in the musical world of their era. Miller had kept annual countdown lists of his favorite records throughout his life, and his personal project of compiling those lists onto CDs evolved into a formal endeavor to explain what made those songs noteworthy, for {{what was then the}} last 50 years of recorded music. The writing process started in 2006, when Miller took a hiatus from music making after the release of What <b>If</b> <b>It</b> <b>Works?.</b> Portions of the book were serially published in draft form on Miller's official web site, where Miller responded to fan requests by writing about one year at a time, in random order.|$|E

After a much longer than normal test, Deckard concludes Rachael is a replicant who believes she is human. Tyrell explains she is an experiment who has been given false memories to provide an emotional [...] "cushion".|$|E

[...] Former Flames coach Jim Playfair recalled that Giordano stood out among the group of invitees and said that his skill and skating ability set him apart: [...] "Darryl (Sutter) met {{with three or four}} of those kids and gave them all the same contracts: Three years in the American League, and <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>works</b> out for you, you've got a career. [...] Gio took it and ran with it." [...] The Flames signed him to a contract following the camp.|$|E

500|$|North's low {{academic}} {{results have}} led to criticism. In February 2007 Minneapolis City Council member Don Samuels suggested burning North down. [...] "My children will not darken {{the door of a}} Minneapolis public school in this city at this time under these conditions. I've said burn North High School down! I can't be paying as a taxpayer for the education of my neighbors and 72 percent of them are failing—meaning black boys.

Samuels later apologized for the [...] "extreme language" [...] but stated that he did not regret making the comments.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} {{reviews of}} the album, published by the LA Weekly and Newsweek, were positive. Rolling Stone critic Christian Hoard wrote that [...] "Octagon's verses often feel unfocused and random, but when he bears down he can be mesmerizing, channeling his quick-tongued rhymes with streetwise brassiness and cosmic vibrations." [...] Allmusic reviewer Marisa Brown wrote that the album [...] "doesn't always {{make a lot of}} sense, but that's the beauty of it. It's a kind of concept album that concentrates more on the actual overall sound than the concepts. Its elements are all on the very edge of control, which is both exhilarating and terrifying at the same time; <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>works,</b> it could bring us to where we've never been, protect us from what may be, but if it fails, it could kill us all." [...] Hip Hop DX reviewer B. Love wrote, [...] "This is Kool Keith's best album in years—arguably even better than his classic Octagonecologyst—and marks a fine return to form for one of rap music's most distinctive and original talents." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN's Ramsey Isler {{gave the}} episode a mixed review, noting that [...] "its concept is intriguing, bold, and {{extremely}} risky. I'm {{just not sure}} <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>works.</b> It's such a drastic change of scenery and tone it's hard to say whether this is genius or madness." [...] Isler observed {{that he would have}} [...] "absolutely loved" [...] the episode if he had been [...] "given appropriate context through a suitable setup... But the approach we got feels an awful lot like a gimmick, and this show does not need to gamble with gimmicks at this point." [...] Isler did find positive elements of the episode however, and rated it 8 out of 10, an indication of a [...] "great" [...] episode. He praised Walter's return [...] "to a much more confident, focused man who's a bit scary in his determination and resolve," [...] as well as the events that followed. Isler concluded that [...] "the core ideas are really good, but the way the new concepts were introduced seems haphazard, and a huge gamble that could turn off all but the most hardcore viewers." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{historical}} {{details of}} these preliminary negotiations were controversial {{between the two}} competing suitors. Tom Kalinske {{said that he and}} Joe Miller of Sega of America were [...] "quite impressed" [...] with SGI's prototype, inviting their hardware team to travel from Japan to meet with SGI. The engineers from Sega Enterprises claimed that their evaluation of the early prototype had uncovered several unresolved hardware issues and deficiencies. Those were subsequently resolved, but Sega had already decided against SGI's design. Nintendo resisted that summary conclusion, arguing that the real reason for SGI's ultimate choice of partner is that Nintendo was a more appealing business partner than Sega. While Sega demanded exclusive rights to the chip, Nintendo was willing to license the technology on a non-exclusive basis. Michael Slater, publisher of Microprocessor Report said, [...] "The mere fact of a business relationship there is significant because of Nintendo's phenomenal ability to drive volume. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>works</b> at all, it could bring MIPS to levels of volume [...] never dreamed of".|$|E

Zubov recalls that he had heard [...] "nothing back" [...] until they made a [...] "last minute decision" [...] to include Steel Storm: Burning Retribution in the Humble Indie Bundle 3. Even then, Zubov further described his dissatisfaction with how payment was handled, saying that they were [...] "offered a tiny-tiny fraction of what HIB3 made, a very small (compared to the profits of HIB3) fixed amount of money" [...] even though, according to Zubov, [...] "when Steel Storm was released as a bonus, their sales jumped up significantly." [...] He also mentioned that despite claims by the organizers that their sales would [...] "sky rocket just because [...] were in the HIB3", their actual amount of sales remained relatively constant. Zubov noted that their inclusion in the third bundle [...] "did get a lot of users who redeemed their copy of Steel Storm on Steam and Desura" [...] and that they hoped this would help keep their [...] "current user base, which we gained with HIB3, interested in our upcoming games". He concluded his comments about his experiences by saying that [...] "only time will tell if HIB3 was [...] awesome deal or not. Maybe, maybe not. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>works</b> out as a long term investment, it will be awesome indeed.
