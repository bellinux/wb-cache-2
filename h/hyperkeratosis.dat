5|$|Palmoplantar keratodermas are {{a diverse}} group of {{hereditary}} and acquired keratodermas in which there is <b>hyperkeratosis</b> of the skin of the palms and soles.|$|E
5|$|Psoriasis {{can affect}} the nails and {{produces}} a variety {{of changes in the}} appearance of finger and toe nails. Nail psoriasis occurs in 40–45% of people with psoriasis affecting the skin and has a lifetime incidence of 80–90% in those with psoriatic arthritis. These changes include pitting of the nails (pinhead-sized depressions in the nail is seen in 70% with nail psoriasis), whitening of the nail, small areas of bleeding from capillaries under the nail, yellow-reddish discoloration of the nails known as the oil drop or salmon spot, thickening of the skin under the nail (subungual <b>hyperkeratosis),</b> loosening and separation of the nail (onycholysis), and crumbling of the nail.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that, in 12 workers exposed for two or more years to acetic acid airborne average concentration of 51 ppm (estimated), produced symptoms of conjunctive irritation, upper respiratory tract irritation, and hyperkeratotic dermatitis. Exposure to 50 ppm or more is intolerable to most persons and results in intensive lacrimation and irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, with pharyngeal oedema and chronic bronchitis. Unacclimatised humans experience extreme eye and nasal irritation at concentrations in excess of 25 ppm, and conjunctivitis from concentrations below 10 ppm {{has been reported}}. In a study of five workers exposed for seven to 12 years to concentrations of 80 to 200 ppm at peaks, the principal findings were blackening and <b>hyperkeratosis</b> of {{the skin of the}} hands, conjunctivitis (but no corneal damage), bronchitis and pharyngitis, and erosion of the exposed teeth (incisors and canines).|$|E
25|$|Symptoms {{will include}} swelling, edema, and pain from a {{multitude}} of secondary complications (pressure, musculoskeletal disorder from asymmetry, restricted blood flow). Most patients will avoid discussing pain for many reasons, so this will require logical thinking or communication skills to assess. In advanced lymphedema, there may be the presence of skin changes such as discoloration, verrucous (wart-like) hyperplasia, <b>hyperkeratosis,</b> papillomatosis, and Ulcer (dermatology).|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s and 1970s {{there were}} {{problems}} with <b>hyperkeratosis,</b> a disease causing corny pads and severe pain. Today it is widely known which dogs carried the disease and respectable breeders do not use those bloodlines any more. A health {{study conducted by the}} Irish Terrier Club of America showed a greater-than-expected incidence of hypothyroidism and cataracts. There are not enough eye-checked individuals to draw any conclusions.|$|E
25|$|Individuals with RD exhibit growth {{retardation}} {{starting in the}} uterus, tight and rigid skin with erosions, prominent superﬁcial vasculature and epidermal <b>hyperkeratosis,</b> abnormal facial features (small mouth, small pinched nose and micrognathia), sparse or absent eyelashes and eyebrows, mineralization defects of the skull, thin dysplastic clavicles, pulmonary hypoplasia and multiple joint contractures. Most affected individuals die in the uterus or are stillbirths, and liveborns usually die within a week.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the unique}} {{function}} of retinal as a visual chromophore, {{one of the earliest}} and specific manifestations of vitamin A deficiency is impaired vision, particularly in reduced light – night blindness. Persistent deficiency gives rise to a series of changes, the most devastating of which occur in the eyes. Some other ocular changes are referred to as xerophthalmia. First there is dryness of the conjunctiva (xerosis) as the normal lacrimal and mucus-secreting epithelium is replaced by a keratinized epithelium. This is followed by the build-up of keratin debris in small opaque plaques (Bitot's spots) and, eventually, erosion of the roughened corneal surface with softening and destruction of the cornea (keratomalacia) and leading to total blindness. Other changes include impaired immunity (increased risk of ear infections, urinary tract infections, Meningococcal disease), <b>hyperkeratosis</b> (white lumps at hair follicles), keratosis pilaris and squamous metaplasia of the epithelium lining the upper respiratory passages and urinary bladder to a keratinized epithelium. In relation to dentistry, a deficiency in vitamin A may lead to enamel hypoplasia.|$|E

500|$|The disease {{caused by}} Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis is called chytridiomycosis. [...] Frogs {{infected}} by this disease generally show skin lesions and <b>hyperkeratosis,</b> {{and it is}} believed that death occurs because of interference with skin functions including maintenance of fluid balance, electrolyte homeostasis, respiration and role as a barrier to infections. The time from infection to death {{has been found to be}} 1–2 weeks in experimental tests, but infected animals can carry the fungus as long as 220 days. There are several hypotheses on the transmission and vectors of the fungus.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} common {{dermatitis}} problems for flower pickers, packers, florists and gardeners, [...] "daffodil itch", involves dryness, fissures, scaling, and erythema in the hands, often accompanied by subungual <b>hyperkeratosis</b> (thickening of the skin beneath the nails). It is blamed on exposure to calcium oxalate, chelidonic acid or alkaloids such as lycorine in the sap, either due to a direct irritant effect or an allergic reaction. It has long been recognised that some cultivars provoke dermatitis more readily than others. N. pseudonarcissus and the cultivars [...] "Actaea", [...] "Camparelle", [...] "Gloriosa", [...] "Grande Monarque", [...] "Ornatus", [...] "Princeps" [...] and [...] "Scilly White" [...] are known to do so.|$|E
500|$|The {{conformation}} of the Clydesdale {{has changed}} greatly throughout its history. In the 1920s and 1930s, {{it was a}} compact horse smaller than the Shire, Percheron, and Belgian. Beginning in the 1940s, breeding animals were selected to produce taller horses that looked more impressive in parades and shows. Today, the Clydesdale stands [...] high and weighs [...] Some mature males are larger, standing taller than 18 hands and weighing up to [...] The breed has a straight or slightly [...] facial profile, broad forehead and wide muzzle. It is well muscled and strong, with an arched neck, high withers, and a sloped shoulder. Breed associations {{pay close attention to}} the quality of the hooves and legs, as well as the general movement. Their gaits are active, with clearly lifted hooves and a general impression of power and quality. Clydesdales are energetic, with a manner described by the Clydesdale Horse Society as a [...] "gaiety of carriage and outlook". Clydesdales have been identified to be at risk for chronic progressive lymphedema, a disease with clinical signs that include progressive swelling, <b>hyperkeratosis,</b> and fibrosis of distal limbs that is similar to chronic lymphedema in humans. Another health concern is a skin condition on the lower leg where feathering is heavy. Colloquially called [...] "Clyde's itch", it's thought to be caused by a type of mange. Clydesdales are also known to develop sunburn on any pink skin pigmentation around their face.|$|E
500|$|Shire stallions may be black, bay or grey. They {{may not be}} roan or {{have large}} amounts of white markings. Mares and geldings may be black, bay, grey or roan. In the UK stallions may not be chestnut, but the colour is allowed by the US association. The Shire Horse Society of the UK {{specifies}} that stallions must stand at least [...] high when mature, and they average around [...] Geldings are required {{to be at least}} [...] high and mares at least [...] Their average weight ranges from [...] for geldings and stallions, with no set standard for mares. The head of a Shire is long and lean, with large eyes, set on a neck that is slightly arched and long in proportion to the body. The shoulder is deep and wide, the chest wide, the back muscular and short and the hindquarters long and wide. Not [...] too much feathering is to occur on the legs, and the hair is fine, straight, and silky. Smaller Shires, under , are generally preferred for working horses, while taller horses, especially those over , are used for show and promotional purposes. The breed is known for its easy-going temperament. Shires have been identified to be at risk for chronic progressive lymphedema, a chronic progressive disease that includes symptoms of progressive swelling, <b>hyperkeratosis,</b> and fibrosis of distal limbs. The disease is similar to chronic lymphedema in humans.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} dermal {{reactions}} to tattoo pigments are granulomas and various lichenoid diseases. [...] Other conditions noted have been cement dermatitis, collagen deposits, discoid lupus erythematosus, eczematous eruptions, <b>hyperkeratosis</b> and parakeratosis, and keloids.|$|E
2500|$|Periwound {{skin damage}} caused by {{excessive}} amounts of exudate and other bodily fluids can perpetuate the non-healing status of chronic wounds. Maceration, excoriation, dry (fragile) skin, <b>hyperkeratosis,</b> callus and eczema are frequent problems [...] that interfere with the integrity of periwound skin. They can create a gateway for infection as well as cause wound edge deterioration preventing wound closure.|$|E
2500|$|Canine {{distemper}} virus {{tends to}} orient its infection towards the lymphoid, epithelial, and nervous tissues. The virus initially replicates in the lymphatic tissue of the respiratory tract. [...] The virus then enters the blood stream and infects the respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital, epithelial, and central nervous systems, and optic nerves. Therefore, the typical pathologic features of canine distemper include lymphoid depletion (causing immunosuppression and leading to secondary infections), interstitial pneumonia, encephalitis with demyelination, and <b>hyperkeratosis</b> {{of the nose}} and foot pads.|$|E
2500|$|The white {{appearance}} {{is created by}} <b>hyperkeratosis</b> (overproduction of keratin) and epithelial hyperplasia. The causative agent implicated is Epstein-Barr virus, the same virus that causes infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever). After the primary EBV infection has been overcome, the virus will persist {{for the rest of}} the host's life and [...] "hides" [...] from the immune system by latent infection of B lymphocytes. The virus also causes lytic infection in the oropharynx, but is kept in check by a normal, functioning immune system. Uncontrolled lytic infection is manifested as oral hairy leukoplakia in immunocompromised hosts. OHL usually arises where the immunocompromise is secondary to HIV/AIDS. Rarely are other causes of immunocompromise associated with OHL, but it has been reported in people who have received transplants and are taking immunosuppressive medication. OHL may also accompany chronic graft versus host disease. Even more rare are reports of OHL in persons with competent immune systems.|$|E
50|$|Epidermolytic <b>hyperkeratosis</b> can be {{categorized}} into two types. People with PS-type epidermolytic <b>hyperkeratosis</b> have thick skin on the palms of their hands and soles of their feet (palmoplantar or palm/sole <b>hyperkeratosis)</b> {{in addition to other}} areas of the body. People with the other type, NPS-type, do not have extensive palmoplantar <b>hyperkeratosis</b> but do have <b>hyperkeratosis</b> on other areas of the body.|$|E
5000|$|... Characteristic histologic {{feature is}} regular {{alternation}} of slightly raised parakeratotic areas without a granular layer (hypogranulosis) and slightly depressed orthokeratotic areas with prominent granular layer (hypergranulosis). Orthokeratotic <b>hyperkeratosis</b> is characterised by <b>hyperkeratosis</b> with non-nucleated cells. Parakeratotic <b>hyperkeratosis</b> is characterised by <b>hyperkeratosis</b> with nucleated cells.|$|E

5000|$|Epidermolytic <b>hyperkeratosis</b> {{is part of}} a {{group of}} {{conditions}} called ichthyoses, which refers to the scaly skin seen in individuals with related disorders. However, in epidermolytic <b>hyperkeratosis,</b> the skin is thick but not scaly as in some of the other conditions in the group.http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/epidermolytic-hyperkeratosis ...|$|E
5000|$|...The plaques are {{characterized}} histologically by <b>hyperkeratosis</b> {{which is a}} thickening of the outer layer of skin. <b>Hyperkeratosis</b> {{is often associated with}} an abnormal amount of keratin production.

50|$|The {{symptoms}} of ichthyosis hystrix Curth-Macklin {{are similar to}} epidermolytic <b>hyperkeratosis</b> (NPS-2 type) {{but there is no}} blistering and the <b>hyperkeratosis</b> is verrucous or spine-like. The <b>hyperkeratosis</b> is brown-grey in colour and is most obvious on the arms and legs. It is an autosomal dominant condition and can be caused by errors to the KRT1 gene. It is named after Helen Ollendorff Curth (1899-1982), a German-Jewish dermatologist, and Madge Thurlow Macklin (1893-1962), an American medical geneticist, {{and is one of the}} first syndromes named after two women.|$|E
