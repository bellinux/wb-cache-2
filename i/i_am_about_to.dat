You are now of age, and it's high time you began to think of taking a wife. Several old and hideous princesses who are enormously poor have proposed for your hand, and I think it high time you began to think of making one of them unhappy.|$|E

25|$|The term fly {{is applied}} by sea {{fishermen}} {{to a certain}} arrangement of feathers, wax, etc., which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> describe the manufacture of, and which may be used with considerable success in mackerel, basse, and pollack fishing. I am not disposed to think, however, that such baits are ever mistaken by the fish which {{they are intended to}} capture for flies; but the number used, {{the way in which they}} are mounted, viz., several on one trace, and the method of their progress through the water, rather leads me to the belief that they are mistaken for a number of small fry, and treated accordingly.|$|E

25|$|The {{practice}} of separating the prefix of the infinitive mode from the verb, by {{the intervention of}} an adverb, is not unfrequent among uneducated persons… I am not conscious, that any rule has been heretofore given in relation to this point… The practice, however, of not separating the particle from its verb, is so general and uniform among good authors, and the exceptions are so rare, that the rule which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> propose will, I believe, prove to be as accurate as most rules, and may be found beneficial to inexperienced writers. It is this :—The particle, TO, which comes before the verb in the infinitive mode, must {{not be separated from}} it by the intervention of an adverb or any other word or phrase; but the adverb should immediately precede the particle, or immediately follow the verb.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Budan's theorem was of such great importance, the {{appearance}} of Sturm's theorem in 1827 gave it (and Vincent's theorem) the death blow. Sturm's theorem solved the real root isolation problem, by defining the precise number of real roots a polynomial has in a real open interval (a, b); moreover, Sturm himself, p.108, acknowledges the great influence Fourier's theorem had on him: « C'est en m'appuyant sur les principes qu'il a posés, et en imitant ses démonstrations, que j'ai trouvé les nouveaux théorèmes que je vais énoncer. » which translates to «It is by relying upon the principles he has laid out and by imitating his proofs that I have found the new theorems which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> present.» Because of the above, the theorems by Fourier and Sturm appear in almost all the books on the theory of equations and Sturm's method for computing the real roots of polynomials {{has been the only}} one widely known and used ever since – up to about 1980, when it was replaced (in almost all computer algebra systems) by methods derived from Vincent's theorem, the fastest one being the Vincent–Akritas–Strzeboński (VAS) method.|$|E

According to Billboard, Lorde said she'd be writing new material in December 2013. While responding to a fan on her Instagram account in August 2016, {{she said that the}} record is written and they're in production stages now. In November, she posted a note on her Facebook account stating: [...] "Writing Pure Heroine was my way of enshrining our teenage glory, putting it up in lights forever so that part of me never dies, and this record— well, this one is about what comes next. ...The party is about to start. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> show you the new world." ...|$|E

500|$|The Duke and Duchess {{settled in}} France. In May 1939, the Duke was {{commissioned}} by NBC to give a radio broadcast (his first since abdicating) {{during a visit to}} the battlefields of Verdun. In it he appealed for peace, saying [...] "I am deeply conscious of the presence of the great company of the dead, and I am convinced that could they make their voices heard they would be with me in what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> say. I speak simply as a soldier of the Last War whose most earnest prayer it is that such cruel and destructive madness shall never again overtake mankind. There is no land whose people want war." [...] The broadcast was heard across the world and by millions in America. It was widely seen as supporting appeasement, and the BBC refused to broadcast it. It was broadcast outside the United States on shortwave radio and was reported in full by British broadsheet newspapers.|$|E
500|$|One of the family's keenest {{customers}} was Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas James Birch, later Bosvile, {{a wealthy}} collector from Lincolnshire, who bought several specimens from them. In 1820 Birch became {{disturbed by the}} family's poverty. Having made no major discoveries for a year, {{they were at the}} point of having to sell their furniture to pay the rent. So he decided to auction the fossils he had purchased from them on their behalf. He wrote to the palaeontologist Gideon Mantell on 5 March that year to say that the sale was [...] "for the benefit of the poor woman and her son and daughter at Lyme, who have in truth found almost all the fine things which have been submitted to scientific investigation ... I may never again possess what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> part with, yet in doing it I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that the money will be well applied." [...] The auction was held at Bullocks in London on 15 May 1820, and raised £400 (worth the equivalent of over £26,000 in 2010). How much of that was given to the Annings is not known, but it seems to have placed the family on a steadier financial footing, and with buyers arriving from Paris and Vienna, the three-day event raised the family's profile within the geological community.|$|E

Three days later, he changed the banner on his Facebook page to read [...] "Dear Lord, Forgive me for all of my sins and the sins I may commit today.

For I have singled him out, that he may instruct his children and his posterity to keep the way of the Lord by doing what is just and right, in order that the Lord may bring about for Abraham what He has promised him."

2500|$|The Ardas {{is usually}} always done {{standing}} up with folded hands. The {{beginning of the}} Ardas is strictly set by the tenth Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh. When it comes to conclusion of this prayer, the devotee uses words like [...] "Waheguru please bless me in the task that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> undertake" [...] when starting a new task or [...] "Akal Purakh, having completed the hymn-singing, we ask for your continued blessings {{so that we can}} continue with your memory and remember you at all times", etc. The word [...] "Ardās" [...] is derived from Persian word 'Arazdashat', meaning a request, supplication, prayer, petition or an address to a superior authority.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{attendees}} at {{the ceremony}} included {{several members of the}} Pon Goebelin Regiment of the German Army, as the Duke had been an honorary colonel. The group was led by Field Marshall Wilhelm von Hahnke. A variety of British military personal were also present, including Major-General Wykham Leigh Pemberton. During the ceremony, the King declared, [...] "The statue <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> unveil is committed to the care of the City of Westminster." [...] This was unexpected, as the statue was actually owned by the Office of Works. Some two weeks passed before the two offices came to agreement that it would be handed back from the City of Westminster to the Office of Works.|$|E
2500|$|Whilst on tour in Europe in 1902, Houdini visited Blois {{with the}} aim of meeting the widow of Emile Houdin, the son of Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin, for an {{interview}} and permission to visit his grave. He did not receive permission but still visited the grave. Houdini believed that he had been treated unfairly and later wrote a negative account of the incident in his magazine, claiming he was [...] "treated most discourteously by Madame W.

[...] In 1906, he {{sent a letter to the}} French magazine L'Illusionniste stating: [...] "You will certainly enjoy the article on Robert Houdin <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> publish in my magazine.

I have no greater care than how I may best adorn with a splendid structure that sacred spot, which, under Divine direction, I have disencumbered as it were of the heavy weight of foul idol worship;(Roman temple of Venus) a spot which has been accounted holy from the beginning in God’s judgment, but which now appears holier still, since it has brought to light a clear assurance of our Saviour’s passion.
