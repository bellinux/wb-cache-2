40|$|The {{move toward}} {{lead-free}} electronics {{has become a}} rapidly emerging issue for concern and evaluation. The movement has been triggered by the European Union’s (EU) proposal for a Directive on Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) and by the Japanese focus on environmental marketing. The candidate solder alloys that {{have been identified as}} substi-tutes require high soldering temperatures since these alloys have typical melting temperatures between 198 °C and 227 °C. Concern has been raised that the higher processing temperatures required for wave and reflow soldering with these alloys will cre-ate increased drop out due to printed wiring board (PWB) warpage and component failures, since most components are not qualified in terms of reliability for these higher processing tem-peratures. In this paper, we present evidence for an additional reliability concern <b>for</b> <b>lead-free</b> <b>soldered</b> electronic product. Conductive anodic filament (CAF) formation is a failure mode associated with boards, which either operate or are stored in a humid envi-ronment. This paper compares the number of CAF formed on boards reflowed at 201 °C vs. 241 °C after aging under 100 V bias at 85 °C/ 85 % RH for 28 days.

Experimental observations showed low shear rate tests of solder joints cannot be used to accurately predict the mode of deformation and failure behaviors under high speed impact condition. Due to strain rate effect, brittle failure of solder joints under dynamic loadings may not take place at low strain rates. Thus, characterization of solder joints under impact becomes critical in package design and manufacturing for high reliability.
