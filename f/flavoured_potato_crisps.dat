40|$|Eighteen {{brands of}} <b>potato</b> <b>crisps,</b> {{frequently}} consumed, were analyzed {{to establish their}} nutritional value in relation to salt, fat and fatty acid (FA) composition. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to determine moisture, total fat, salt contents and FA profiles (including trans-FAs), and to identify the oil/fat used for frying of the 18 brands of <b>potato</b> <b>crisps.</b> Our results show that salt content ranged from 0. 127 to 2. 77 g/ 100 g and total fat content of <b>potato</b> <b>crisps</b> varied between 20. 0 and 42. 8 g/ 100 g. With respect to FAs analysis, palmitic acid (C 16 : 0), oleic acid (C 18 : 1) and linoleic acid (C 18 : 2) were the major FAs found in the analyzed <b>potato</b> <b>crisps.</b> It is clear from our work that nowadays most <b>potato</b> <b>crisps</b> are currently produced using oils with high contents in unsaturated FAs, which can be considered as healthier from a nutritional point of view. Nevertheless, some brands of <b>potato</b> <b>crisps</b> still use palm oil or a blend of palm oil and other fats/oils, which are very rich in saturated FAs...|$|R

40|$|The {{consumption}} of <b>potato</b> <b>crisps</b> {{has increased in}} the last years, since this snack is highly appreciated, especially by young people, due to the pleasant taste and texture. Nowadays, there are several types of <b>potato</b> <b>crisps</b> available in the market, namely original <b>potato</b> <b>crisps,</b> <b>potato</b> <b>crisps</b> cooked {{in the oven and}} <b>potato</b> <b>crisps</b> with added <b>flavours.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the fatty acids (FA) profile of fourteen brands of <b>potato</b> <b>crisps</b> with <b>flavour.</b> The collection was performed in the major supermarkets chains of Lisbon, and included samples with flavour of ketchup, mustard, smoked ham, cheese and onion, sour cream with onion and hot & spicy. Fatty acids were derivatized to their correspondent methyl esters using a methanolic solution of potassium hydroxide. Analyses were performed in a gas chromatograph (HP 6890 series) equipped with a flame ionisation detector. Our results showed that saturated FA content varied between 0. 824 ± 0. 0 and 13. 8 ± 0. 0 g/ 100 g of edible portion, while monounsaturated FA ranged from 6. 22 ± 0. 0 to 25. 4 ± 0. 0 g/ 100 g. The highest content of elaidic acid (C 18 : 1,trans- 9) (308 ± 3. 4 mg/ 100 g) was found in <b>potato</b> <b>crisps</b> with sour cream and onion. The level of trans FA found in the analysed <b>potato</b> <b>crisps</b> was always lower than 1 %. In 57 % of the analysed samples, the major FA were monounsaturated, while for 29 % were polyunsaturated and 14 % were rich in saturated FA.

P., under the project “PTRANSALT - Evaluation of trans fatty acids, saturated fat and salt in processed foods: current situation in Portugal (2012 DAN 828) ”.

40|$|<b>Potato</b> <b>crisps</b> {{are one of}} {{the food}} {{commodities}} that contribute most to overall dietary human exposure of acrylamide. This investigation has estimated the dietary exposure to acrylamide form <b>potato</b> <b>crisps</b> in the Spanish population. Sampling of <b>potato</b> <b>crisps</b> (n = 36) from 16 different producers were carried out in March 2008. An average level of 740 μg kg- 1 (ranging from 81 to 2622 μg kg- 1; minimum to maximum) and a median of 592 μg kg- 1 were obtained. Acrylamide levels in marketed <b>potato</b> <b>crisps</b> have been significantly reduced (nearly to 50 %) compared with a previous sampling performed 4 years earlier. The observed signal value (90 th percentile) was 1377 μg kg- 1 with 86 % of the samples with acrylamide levels lower than 1000 μg kg- 1. Dietary exposure to acrylamide from <b>potato</b> <b>crisp</b> consumption in the total Spanish population was estimated to be 0. 042 μg kg- 1 body weight day- 1 by using a deterministic approach based on the National consumption database. In a second study, dietary exposure (based on a 3 -day food record) was determined to be 0. 053 μg kg- 1 body weight day- 1 for the adult population (17 - 60 years) and 0. 142 μg kg- 1 body weight day- 1 for children (7 - 12 years).

2500|$|Another type {{of potato}} chip, notably the Pringles and Lay's Stax brands, {{is made by}} {{extruding}} or pressing a dough made from dehydrated potatoes into the desired shape before frying.

Pringles are officially branded as <b>potato</b> <b>crisps,</b> but they are rarely referred to as such by Americans. Conversely, Pringles may be termed potato chips in Britain, to distinguish them from traditional [...] "crisps".

40|$|There {{has been}} little {{research}} conducted to determine the impact that colour and packaging have as stimuli on the purchasing process for a low involvement non-durable product. Garber, Burke and Jones (2000) showed that the colour of the product’s package is an overlooked tool that marketers can use to gain the consumers’ attention. The research approach for this study comprised in-depth interviews with a supermarket manager and a design director, and a survey of <b>potato</b> <b>crisp</b> consumers. <b>Potato</b> <b>crisps</b> were chosen, as they are a low involvement non-durable product in a competitive market. This research showed that while consumers did not consciously believe that the colour of the packaging affected their purchasing decision, {{it was an important}} subconscious stimulus through the relationship that colour had with the most important stimulus of flavour. Showing a differing perspective, the supermarket manager believed that the quality, brand and price were all important stimuli for <b>potato</b> <b>crisp</b> purchasing, while the director acknowledged the increasing importance that is placed on colour and packaging today. It seems that the importance of colour and packaging as stimuli may be often overlooked and more research is needed into this area...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of acrylamide in <b>potato</b> <b>crisps</b> was fitted by empirical mathematical models. Potato slices were fried {{under the same}} experimental conditions for different times. Besides the content of precursors in the raw potato slices, acrylamide and water content in the <b>potato</b> <b>crisps</b> were quantified after predetermined times (2 - 6 min). The temperature developments in the surrounding oil and outer cell layer of the potato slices were monitored, giving more insight in the frying process and making future comparisons between studies possible. The pattern found for the {{formation of}} acrylamide, which was similar to earlier studies, was fitted to three empirical models. Statistical methods were used to compare the performance of the models, with the "Logistic-Exponential" and "Empirical" model performing equally well. The obtained model parameters were in the range of earlier reported studies, although this comparison is not unequivocal as the experimental conditions differed between studies. The precision of parameter estimates was problematic; this should be improved by better experimental design. Nevertheless, the approach of this study will make it possible to truly compare acrylamide formation patterns and model parameters in the future, with the ability to develop a tool to predict acrylamide formation in <b>potato</b> <b>crisps...</b>|$|R
