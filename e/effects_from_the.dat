5|$|Although Josephine {{remained}} well offshore {{of the eastern}} United States, the <b>effects</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> storm and an area of high pressure produced strong winds and high seas along the coast. In North Carolina, high tides caused severe beach erosion and minor damage to ocean-front houses. Minor coastal flooding occurred in New York and New Jersey. In addition, one fatality occurred when a man drowned after falling off his boat while sailing a river in Massachusetts.|$|E

5|$|Just a {{month after}} Ignacio, Hurricane Marty passed through the area, causing {{additional}} damage to areas hit by Ignacio. The combined damage from the two hurricanes totaled about $1billion (2003USD, $1.1billion 2006USD), and the <b>effects</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> two storms left at least 50,000 homeless.|$|E
5|$|Like its predecessors, Mario Party 5 was {{published}} by Nintendo and developed by Hudson Soft. It is the first Mario Party game to have Donkey Kong as a non-playable character. It is also the first Mario Party game to have Wario wearing his current short-sleeve shirt. It is the last Mario Party game where Daisy is voiced by Jen Taylor; for later games, Jen Taylor is replaced by Deanna Mustard. It is the fifth and final Mario Party game to have Bowser's sound <b>effects</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first four Mario Party games.|$|E
5|$|Most {{long-term}} survivors {{alive today}} had low or intermediate risk disease and milder courses of treatment compared to high-risk disease. The majority of survivors have long-term <b>effects</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> treatment. Survivors of intermediate and high-risk treatment often experience hearing loss. Growth reduction, thyroid function disorders, learning difficulties, and {{greater risk of}} secondary cancers affect survivors of high-risk disease. An estimated two of three survivors of childhood cancer will ultimately develop at least one chronic and sometimes life-threatening health problem within 20 to 30 years after the cancer diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{impacting}} the Philippines, Public Storm Warning Signals #3 and #4, the two highest levels, {{were raised}} for several provinces in Luzon. Thousands of residents were urged to evacuate while local authorities prepared services for quick recovery efforts. With Cimaron initially expected to strike Vietnam, officials planned to evacuate 218,000people; however, Cimaron's slow motion and demise over open waters resulted in these plans being suspended. Officials in Thailand and southern China also advised residents of possible <b>effects</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> storm.|$|E
5|$|The rapid {{development}} of wind power in South Australia {{has led to}} direct economic <b>effects</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> construction and operation of wind farms. There has been a total of $2.8 billion in wind power investment up to October 2011 which is estimated to have created 3,000 direct and indirect jobs. Studies into the economic effects of wind farms have reported that a 50 MW installation pays host landholders some $250,000 per year, is constructed by workers who spend up to $1.2 million locally and contributes up to $80,000 annually to community projects.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the second}} time an East Pacific storm was named Naomi and the only time that a storm named Naomi in the basin reached {{hurricane}} strength. Because the <b>effects</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> hurricane were minor, the name was not retired after this hurricane and was re-used in the 1976 season. However, a name change in 1978 dropped the name Naomi, and the name has not been used since.|$|E

5|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{destruction}} of the Quino checkerspot butterfly were raised by the community group Preserve South Bay. That group sued the developer as well as Caltrans and SANDAG in August 1999, following the latter's approval for the project. Early the next year, an environmental impact report suggested that Bonita might face negative <b>effects</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> freeway, such as noise and having the roadway divide the community. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) allowed the project that year, even though the Environmental Protection Agency objected to it. A contractor for the project was soon retained by California Transportation Ventures. Another group, Citizens for 125, obtained 7,000 signatures in support of the road.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Arthur (RSMC Nadi designation: 08F, JTWC designation: 09P) was {{the eighth}} {{tropical}} depression and fourth tropical cyclone of the 2006–07 South Pacific cyclone season. Forming as tropical depression on January25, Arthur rapidly intensified into a strong Category 2 cyclone on the Australian intensity scale {{according to the}} Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in Nadi, Fiji. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center assessed the storm to have peaked as a minimal Category 1 cyclone. Shortly after peaking in intensity, the cyclone began to deteriorate due to unfavorable conditions. Quickly moving towards the east-southeast, the Arthur began to undergo an extratropical transition. After turning towards the southeast, the center of circulation was almost fully exposed due to strong wind shear. However, Arthur briefly re-strengthened late on January26 before becoming extratropical the next day. Tropical Cyclone Arthur affected several small islands during its existence. French Polynesia observed the most noteworthy <b>effects</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> storm, where several landslides damaged a few homes.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{continuing}} <b>effects</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{strong wind}} shear, a large, deep burst of convection {{formed in the}} northern semicircle of Josephine. The center {{was found to have}} shifted towards the new convection leading to an increase in intensity. The forecast showed a slight decrease in wind shear as Josephine continued westward and no change in intensity over the 5-day forecast was predicted. However, the convection decreased once more and the low became completely exposed by the late morning hours and Josephine weakened again. By the afternoon, the center of Josephine was only a swirl of clouds, devoid of convection. During the overnight hours on September 4 into the morning of September 5, convection associated with Josephine began to redevelop somewhat, mostly {{to the north of the}} circulation, due to the strong southerly wind shear. By mid-morning, Josephine re-intensified slightly due to the redevelopment of some convection. However, the redevelopment was short lived and wind shear again took its toll on Josephine by late morning. The convection around the system became dislocated from the center and Josephine weakened slightly.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{not making}} {{landfall}} on the United States, the hurricane caused widespread damage. Extensive precautionary measures were undertaken across the coast, particularly in New England. The heightened precautions were {{due in part}} to fears that <b>effects</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> storm would be similar to that of a devastating hurricane that struck the region two years prior. Most of the damage associated with the hurricane occurred in New Jersey, where the combination of moisture from the hurricane and a stationary front produced record rainfall, peaking at 24in (610mm) in the town of Ewan. This would make the storm the wettest in state history. The resultant floods damaged infrastructure, mostly to road networks. Damage in the state amounted to $4million. Farther north in New England, strong winds were reported, though damage remained minimal. Although the storm made two landfalls in Atlantic Canada, damage there too was minimal, and was limited to several boating incidents caused by strong waves. Overall, the hurricane caused seven fatalities.|$|E

5|$|In western Grenada, high waves {{affected}} {{much of the}} coastline, destroying 21small {{boats and}} causing significant beach erosion. The waves covered the entire Grand Anse Beach in Saint George Parish. The erosion heavily impacted tourist areas and also threatened {{the foundation of the}} runway at the Maurice Bishop International Airport. Storm damage cut off the towns in western Grenada from the capital city of Saint George's. The cut-off roads resulted in an island-wide fuel shortage. In Saint John Parish, the storm knocked out the water and power supply and forced several families to evacuate their damaged houses. The small island Carriacou, located north of Grenada, sustained damage to the road to its primary airport. At least 10homes were destroyed in the country, and damage totaled $94.6million; this represented 27percent of the island's gross domestic product. <b>Effects</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> storm reached as far south as Trinidad and Tobago. In the country, storm surge caused damage to boats and coastal structures, while beach erosion was reported in Tobago.|$|E

5|$|Nonfatal {{health effects}} were {{difficult}} to measure in the smog's immediate aftermath. Some of the health effects were themselves delayed; for example, most of the serious effects on the elderly population would only manifest days after initial exposure. A study on the smog's nonfatal health effects was published in December 1966. The study, conducted by a nonprofit health research group, found that 10 percent of the city's population suffered some negative health <b>effects</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> smog, including symptoms like stinging eyes, coughing, wheezing, the coughing-up of phlegm, or difficulty breathing. The director of the research group said anything serious enough to adversely affect as much as 10 percent of the population, like the smog had, indicated {{the existence of a}} serious public health problem.|$|E
5|$|On September15, {{the eye of}} Choi-wan passed within 10km (5mi) of Alamagan {{and brought}} winds of up to 230km/h (145mph) to the island. The most recent storm of Choi-wan's {{intensity}} to strike the islands was Typhoon Chaba in 2004. That storm caused severe damage and widespread flooding. Unlike Chaba, relatively little rainfall fell due to Choi-wan, and no flooding was reported. The main <b>effects</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> typhoon in Saipan were downed trees which littered streets across the islands. Power lines were downed and sewer pipes were broken; however, crews began repairing damage once Choi-wan passed. In Garapan, the major shelter on the island sustained minor damage and repair work on it would take roughly a week.|$|E
5|$|Passing through The Bahamas on August 6–7, the {{tropical}} storm caused minor {{damage on the}} islands. Due to the rough seas, ships were taken to Nassau Harbor to ride out the storm. The storm passed without any disruption of shipping services. However, the flying boat Topsy Fish, containing two people, became lost over Bahamian waters on August8. The plane and crew were later found north of Andros Island by a Miami relief plane and a boat from Nassau three days later. Cuba, located south of the storm throughout its duration, reported minimal <b>effects</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> hurricane, other than a lowering of barometric pressures as reported by José Carlos Millás, then-chief of the Cuban National Observatory. However, occasional thunderstorm activity fueled by the hurricane dropped rainfall over the island, and the storm generated heavy seas at the Cuban coast.|$|E
