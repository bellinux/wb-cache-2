5|$|But {{the event}} could not mask the {{economic}} crisis into which Poland was drifting, exacerbated by Soviet demands for more military spending. Although the system of fixed, artificially low food prices kept urban discontent under control, it caused further economic strain. In the long run the situation was unsustainable, and on 12 December 1970 (just before Christmas), the regime suddenly announced massive increases in the prices of basic foodstuffs, the government's main source of hard currency when exported. The new measures were <b>incomprehensible</b> <b>to</b> many urban workers, and their provocative timing (the most intense food purchase period for most Polish families) led to strong social reaction and ultimately Gomułka's fall from power.|$|E
5|$|His Defensa de los curas de Riobamba {{was written}} in {{response}} to a report from Ignacio Barreto that accused the clergy in Riobamba of various unethical practices. Among other things, the report said that the large number of religious celebrations in Riobamba (frequented by Indians) were prejudicial to Catholic faith, agriculture, industry and the interests of the Crown; also, that priests demanded money from the Indians for entrance into churches and for certain ceremonies, that priests in Riobamba were immoral and finally that most sermons were <b>incomprehensible</b> <b>to</b> the Indians.|$|E
5|$|In 1846, 57 {{percent of}} Belgians spoke dialects of Dutch or Flemish {{as their primary}} {{language}} while 42 percent spoke dialects of French, such as Walloon, Picard or Gaumais. Under {{one percent of the}} population spoke German. Across the country, the aristocracy and middle classes spoke French, often as a second language, and French was the language of the legal system and government. There was a huge variation in accents, spelling and grammar across the country, particularly in Flanders, where regional dialects were almost <b>incomprehensible</b> <b>to</b> those from other regions.|$|E

5|$|After their {{original}} religious activities ceased, Egyptian temples suffered slow decay. Many were defaced by Christians trying {{to erase the}} remnants of ancient Egyptian religion. Some temple buildings, such as the mammisi at Dendera or the hypostyle hall at Philae, were adapted into churches or other types of buildings. Most commonly the sites were left disused, as at the Temple of Khnum at Elephantine, while locals carried off their stones to serve as material for new buildings. The dismantling of temples for stone continued well into modern times. Limestone was especially useful {{as a source of}} lime, so temples built of limestone were almost all dismantled. Sandstone temples, found mostly in Upper Egypt, were more likely to survive. What humans left intact was still subject to natural weathering. Temples in desert areas could be partly covered by drifts of sand, while those near the Nile, particularly in Lower Egypt, were often buried under layers of river-borne silt. Thus, some major temple sites like Memphis were reduced to ruin, while many temples far from the Nile and centers of population remained mostly intact. With understanding of the hieroglyphic script lost, the information about Egyptian culture that was preserved in the surviving temples lay <b>incomprehensible</b> <b>to</b> the world.|$|E
5|$|By June 1848 {{many of the}} {{specimens}} {{from the}} Wilkes Expedition had been damaged or lost. Many were still not classified or published, as the mismanagement and bungling that had plagued the expedition before it ever departed continued. While {{on a trip to}} Washington, D.C., that month with his new bride, Gray was hired to study the botanical specimens for five years. This included a year in Europe, with his wife, using the facilities at the herbariums in Europe. Mr.and Mrs.Gray departed for England on June11, 1850. They spent the summer traveling to Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, and the Netherlands. Gray then set down to work on the expedition's plant sheets at the estate of botanist George Bentham, whom he had met eleven years earlier, and then with William Henry Harvey in Ireland. Gray returned to England and settled into a routine at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. The couple was back in America on September4, 1851. In the meantime, a dispute had arisen between Wilkes and the team of Torrey and Gray about the format of the books resulting from the expedition. Gray almost hired his father-in-law to break the contract. This dispute largely centered on the use of Latin and English. Wilkes wanted a literal Latin to English translation while Torrey and Gray wanted a looser one because they felt that technical English terms were equally <b>incomprehensible</b> <b>to</b> the public. Much of the work was stymied or burned in fires.|$|E

25|$|Another {{potential}} source {{of the power of}} words is their secrecy and exclusivity: very sacred language is differentiated enough from common language that it is <b>incomprehensible</b> <b>to</b> {{the majority of the population}} and it can only be used and interpreted by specialized practitioners (magicians, priests, shamans, even mullahs).|$|E
25|$|The {{language}} of alchemy soon developed an arcane and secretive technical vocabulary designed to conceal {{information from the}} uninitiated. To a large degree, this language is <b>incomprehensible</b> <b>to</b> us today, though {{it is apparent that}} readers of Geoffery Chaucer's Canon's Yeoman's Tale or audiences of Ben Jonson's The Alchemist were able to construe it sufficiently to laugh at it.|$|E
25|$|A {{language}} game (also called {{secret language}} or ludling or argot) {{is a system}} of manipulating spoken words to render them <b>incomprehensible</b> <b>to</b> the untrained ear. Language games are used primarily by groups attempting to conceal their conversations from others. Some common examples are Pig Latin; the Gibberish family, prevalent in the United States and Sweden; and Verlan, spoken in France.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{fragmentation}} of the Mixtec language and its varieties means that texts published in one variety may be utterly <b>incomprehensible</b> <b>to</b> speakers of another.

25|$|The Tathāgatagarbha Sutras, which {{developed}} in India, played {{a prominent role in}} China. The tathagatagarbha-sutras, on occasion, speak of the ineffable skandhas of the Buddha (beyond the nature of worldly skandhas and beyond worldly understanding). In the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra the Buddha tells of how the Buddha's skandhas are in fact eternal and unchanging. The Buddha's skandhas are said to be <b>incomprehensible</b> <b>to</b> unawakened vision.|$|E
25|$|A {{less popular}} option was the neo-orthodox movement, which affirmed a higher view of Scripture than {{liberalism}} {{but did not}} tie the doctrines of the Christian faith to precise theories of Biblical inspiration. If anything, thinkers in this camp denounced such quibbling as a dangerous distraction from the duties of Christian discipleship. Neo-orthodoxy's highly contextual modes of reasoning often rendered its main premises <b>incomprehensible</b> <b>to</b> American thinkers and it was frequently dismissed as unrealistic.|$|E

25|$|Century 21's {{return to}} {{television}} was the abortive series The Secret Service, which this time mixed live action with Supermarionation. The series {{was inspired by}} Anderson's love of British comedian Stanley Unwin, who {{was known for his}} nonsense language, 'Unwinese', which he created and used on radio, in film and most famously on the 1968 Small Faces LP Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake. Despite Anderson's track record and Unwin's popularity, the series was cancelled before its first screening; Lew Grade considered that it would be <b>incomprehensible</b> <b>to</b> American audiences, and thus unsellable.|$|E
25|$|No observer, either {{academic}} or independent, could have mistaken {{the direction of}} change taken by the avant-garde between 1906 and 1910. The fundamental shift away from nature within artistic circles had advanced {{to the status of}} revolt, in far-reaching ways, diverging significantly from the developments of Cézanne or Seurat. The symptoms of that shift during {{the first decade of the}} 20th century are countless and redoubtable, bursting practically overnight, and were soon to be perceived by the reactionary adversaries as no more than grotesque, <b>incomprehensible,</b> <b>to</b> be considered with haughty amusement.|$|E
25|$|Most times {{a foreign}} {{language}} is spoken in film, subtitles are used to translate the dialogue for the viewer. However, there are occasions when foreign dialogue is left unsubtitled (and thus <b>incomprehensible</b> <b>to</b> most of the target audience). This is often done if the movie is seen predominantly {{from the viewpoint of}} a particular character who does not speak the language. Such absence of subtitles allows the audience to feel a similar sense of incomprehension and alienation that the character feels. An example of this is seen in Not Without My Daughter. The Persian language dialogue spoken by the Iranian characters is not subtitled because the main character Betty Mahmoody does not speak Persian and the audience is seeing the film from her viewpoint.|$|E
5000|$|Foreign Guy (Dane Cook): A nameless {{immigrant}} who calls various places looking for assistance or to purchase something.

The switch is demonstrated visually by having the puppet move between {{the two halves of}} a room across a clear dividing line.|$|R

25|$|In Latvian and Lithuanian {{the names}} Vācija and Vokietija contain the root vāca or vākiā. Lithuanian {{linguist}} Kazimieras Būga associated {{this with a}} reference to a Swedish tribe named Vagoths in a 6th-century chronicle (cf. finn. Vuojola and eston. Oju-/Ojamaa, 'Gotland', both derived from the Baltic word; the ethnonym *vakja, used by the Votes (vadja) and the Sami, in older sources (vuowjos), may also be related). So the word for German possibly comes from a name originally given by West Baltic tribes to the Vikings. Latvian linguist Konstantīnos Karulis proposes that the word may be based on the Indo-European word *wek ("speak"), from which derive Old Prussian wackis ("war cry") or Latvian vēkšķis. Such names could have been used to describe neighbouring people whose language was <b>incomprehensible</b> <b>to</b> Baltic peoples.|$|E

25|$|In Germany, the 1992 remake Hilfe, meine Familie spinnt, {{broadcast}} {{in the prime}} time, reached double the audience than the original ({{broadcast in}} the early fringe time). This, however, {{was not enough to}} maintain the series, so it was cancelled after one season. The remake used the exact translated scripts of the original series (which already substituted localised humour and in-jokes for <b>incomprehensible</b> references <b>to</b> American TV shows not shown in Germany, as well as some totally different jokes) and just renamed place and person names according to the new setting.|$|R
