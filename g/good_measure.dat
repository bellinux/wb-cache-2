40|$|Abstract. Given any {{continuous}} {{nondecreasing function}} g: R → R, with g(t) = 0, ∀t ≤ 0, {{we show that}} there always exists some positive measure µ, concentrated {{on a set of}} zero Newtonian capacity, for which the problem(−∆u+ g(u) = µ in Ω, u = 0 on ∂Ω, (0. 1) admits a solution. This provides an affirmative answer to Open problem 2 raised by Brezis-Marcus-Ponce [3]. When N ≥ 3 and g(t) = et − 1, ∀t ≥ 0, Bartolucci-Leoni-Orsina-Ponce [1] proved that any measure µ ≤ 4 piHN− 2 is good for problem (0. 1).

25|$|Molasses Number is {{a measure}} of the degree of {{decolorization}} of a standard molasses solution that has been diluted and standardized against standardized activated carbon. Due to the size of color bodies, the molasses number represents the potential pore volume available for larger adsorbing species. As all of the pore volume may not be available for adsorption in a particular waste water application, and as some of the adsorbate may enter smaller pores, it is not a <b>good</b> <b>measure</b> of the worth of a particular activated carbon for a specific application. Frequently, this parameter is useful in evaluating a series of active carbons for their rates of adsorption. Given two active carbons with similar pore volumes for adsorption, the one having the higher molasses number will usually have larger feeder pores resulting in more efficient transfer of adsorbate into the adsorption space.|$|E
