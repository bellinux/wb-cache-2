5|$|At the school, the {{fatalities}} {{resulted from}} {{the collapse of a}} concrete block wall. One hallway completely collapsed, trapping many students <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> of the hallway known as 3rd Hall. The tornado at the school was so strong that it tossed and mangled cars in the parking lot, flattened parts of the stadium and tore trees out of the ground. School buses were there for an early dismissal due to the storms at just after 1:00pm, but the tornado hit before the school could be dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the week}} of 11–18 December, the 1st Parachute Battalion from the German 1st Parachute Division—with {{supporting}} units—had prepared strong defences within the Italian coastal town of Ortona. Paratroop engineers and infantry had destroyed much of Ortona itself, turning the streets into a debris-filled maze. Major streets were mined, with demolition charges throughout the main piazza, and booby traps littered the town. German forces had also buried tanks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rubble,</b> leaving only the turrets exposed.|$|E

5|$|Often {{armed with}} no more than shovels and spades, {{soldiers}} and civilians dug for bodies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rubble.</b> Other than this, rescue workers were faced with a number of obstacles, including the temperatures of the villages damaged. They were warm during the day, although the villages grew colder at night, making rescue work harder and threatening the health of the homeless and anyone alive and trapped under the debris. Many civilians were discouraged from helping due to fear of aftershocks. According to Gary Oshea of International Rescue, the volunteers did not have enough technical equipment, and the religious leaders seemed unwilling to contribute much. Official rescue work ended on June 24, 2002, when rescue workers said there were no more survivors.|$|E
5|$|The Frank Slide was a rockslide that buried part of {{the mining}} town of Frank, Northwest Territories, Canada at 4:10 am on April 29, 1903. Over 82 million tonnes (90 million tons) of {{limestone}} rock slid down Turtle Mountain within 100 seconds, obliterating {{the eastern edge of}} Frank, the Canadian Pacific Railway line and the coal mine. It was one of the largest landslides in Canadian history and remains the deadliest, as between 70 and 90 of the town's residents were killed, most of whom remain buried <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rubble.</b> Multiple factors led to the slide: Turtle Mountain's formation left it {{in a constant state of}} instability. Coal mining operations may have weakened the mountain's internal structure, as did a wet winter and cold snap on the night of the disaster.|$|E
5|$|United States Navy and Air Force troops {{stationed}} at Lajes functioned as disaster relief workers, sheltering {{as many as}} 150 families. Portuguese Air Force members brought supplies to earthquake victims, while a João Coutinho class corvette navy ship transported medical officials to the island. The Portuguese President, António Ramalho Eanes, flew in on a plane accompanied by medical personnel and supplies (such as bedding). Local officials including policemen and volunteer firemen cleared roads for relief supplies and transports. Responding to the situation, these officials were also involved in looking for survivors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rubble.</b> Soon after, tents were erected to replace the destroyed or unsafe homes for approximately 200 families of the islands. Portable homes were constructed by the People to People International project fund, resulting in 100 shelters.|$|E
50|$|In 1855 Fresnel lenses were {{installed}} and in 1869 a giant steam whistle {{was set up}} for use in foggy weather. <b>In</b> 1873 <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> towers were taken down and two cast-iron edifices erected, 300 yd apart. One was a fixed and one a flashing light. A fog siren replaced the locomotive whistle.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- We {{propose a}} Rescue Robot system {{which is a}} cross {{platform}} connection between robot and a PC. The Robot is designed with thermostat to sense temperature, camera to detect people <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rubbles</b> and wheels for the movement, with end effecter which can lift a weight of around 200 to 300 gm. Our robot will move <b>in</b> <b>the</b> debris to detect human by using Viola- Jones face detection algorithm. Totally <b>the</b> system aims <b>in</b> directing people among debris, which usually takes {{a day or so}} to bring the regular resources into picture; but our system can get the situation within hours which can aid in giving priority to people alive. It is fast, cost efficient and easy to use...|$|R

25|$|According to Human Rights Watch on 2 August, {{the initial}} {{estimate}} of 54 persons killed {{was based on}} a register of 63 persons who had sought shelter in the basement, and the rescue teams first having located only nine survivors.

There were still 13 people missing, and locals feared they were buried <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rubble.</b>|$|E
25|$|During the {{war years}} of 1942–43, Shahn worked for the Office of War Information (OWI), but his pieces lacked the {{preferred}} patriotism {{of the day and}} only two of his posters were published. His art's anti-war sentiment found other forms of expression in a series of paintings from 1944–45, such as Death on the Beach, which depicts the desolation and loneliness of war. In 1945 he painted Liberation about the Liberation of Paris which depicts children playing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rubble.</b>|$|E
25|$|The attack gained {{controversy}} {{because it}} involved {{the bombing of}} civilians by a military air force. The number of victims is still disputed; the Basque government reported 1,654 people killed at the time, while local historians identified 126 victims (later revised by {{the authors of the}} study to 153). A British source used by the Air War College claims 400 civilians died.

25|$|The {{distributors}} also purport {{that the}} coins {{have been struck}} using silver recovered from a vault <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> of the World Trade Center. The validity of this claim has not been confirmed. Distributors warn that the minting of the coin will cease once the quantity of recovered silver has been exhausted, and have therefore placed a limit {{on the number of}} coins that can be ordered per person. The coins are not solid silver, but are silver clad (0.0001inch (2.5 micrometre) layer). Actual silver content is 45mg, or 0.00145 troy oz.|$|E

25|$|Kallinger {{was arrested}} and imprisoned in 1972 when his {{children}} went to the police.

Red Square was opened to the river, [...] "St. Basil thus crowned the decapitated hillock."
