40|$|The {{interest}} towards student demonstrations {{has increased}} recently {{in connection with}} the recognized and highly active role of youth in the revolution of the late XX – early XXI century. Here a question arises: What was the role {{of the students in the}} process of destabilization of Russian society before the First Russian Revolution? The article is devoted to student unrest in St. Petersburg in the autumn of 1904. It is shown that spontaneous student movement was at the heart of unrest – as well as in 1899 – 1902. «Liberation Union» has proclaimed the necessity of organizing of students and liberal professors for purposeful struggle against the autocracy – but in the events of the autumn of 1904 we cannot find the traces of activity of such organization. There was a liberal campaign, but it had a latent, <b>disguised</b> <b>character,</b> appearing in explicit and implicit criticism of the current regime. However, the agitation has created excited mood among students, and students, who were the members of a party, informed the St. Petersburg Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party about these facts. The Committee decided to use the spontaneous movement, in order to express the proletarian requirements with the help «of all-public demonstrations»; the requirements of proletariat differed from the requirements of the liberal members of Zemstvo (elective district and provincial administrative assembly in prerevolutionary Russia) ...|$|E

50|$|Keeler's {{relations}} with the Duttons grew increasingly erratic and strained as his novels grew increasingly longer and correspondingly less and less popular. His 1941 novel The Peacock Fan appears to take a dig at the Duttons through a pair of faintly <b>disguised</b> <b>characters,</b> and in 1942 after releasing The Book with the Orange Leaves he was finally dropped by Dutton, although Ward Lock continued to issue his books in the United Kingdom until 1953.|$|R
5000|$|Post Oaks & Sand Roughs is a semi-autobiographical {{adventure}} novel by Robert E. Howard. It {{was first published}} in 1989 in France by NéO (Nouvelles Editions Oswald) under the title of [...] "Le Rebelle", since 1990 by Donald M. Grant, Publisher, Inc. in an edition of 850 copies. The book contains an introduction and appendix by Glenn Lord where Lord identifies the real people who appear as thinly <b>disguised</b> <b>characters</b> in the novel.|$|R
50|$|The comedy {{ends with}} a dénouement (a conclusion), in which the protagonist is better off than at the story's outset. The tragedy {{ends with a}} catastrophe, in which the protagonist is worse off than at the {{beginning}} of the narrative. Exemplary of a comic dénouement is the final scene of Shakespeare’s comedy As You Like It, in which couples marry, an evildoer repents, two <b>disguised</b> <b>characters</b> are revealed for all to see, and a ruler is restored to power. In Shakespeare's tragedies, the dénouement is usually the death of one or more characters.|$|R
50|$|An unusual {{aspect of}} Operation Crossbow {{is that all}} the German <b>characters,</b> and the <b>disguised</b> Allied <b>characters</b> in their roles, speak (subtitled) German instead of accented English. The same was true of the 1962 film The Longest Day.|$|R

40|$|Characters’ {{identities are}} {{integral}} to how audiences relate to them. But {{what happens when}} the character suddenly alters his or her outward appearance? Are they still the same person? This thesis seeks to argue that disguise does not alter a character’s true nature, as evidenced by Pyrocles in Sir Philip Sidney’s The Countess of Pembroke’s Arcadia and the Prince in Margaret Cavendish’s The Convent of Pleasure. Both Pyrocles’ suit of Philoclea and the Prince’s suit of Lady Happy are successful because, however subversive they appear at first, they ultimately adhere to societal norms of the time. The relationship between the cross-dressed prince and his love interest in both works only appears to subvert heteronormative expectations for the time, but ultimately adheres to these societal norms once the <b>disguised</b> <b>character’s</b> true identity is revealed to his chosen partner...|$|R
50|$|He goes to {{lengths to}} {{disguise}} {{his age and}} appearance by creating a costume with a false head to increase his height. This was in fact intended as a ruse {{on the part of}} writer Alan Grant to <b>disguise</b> the <b>character's</b> true identity, and to confuse the reader into believing Anarky to be an adult.|$|R
5000|$|The {{voice for}} the female {{character}} of Naresh (as [...] "Prema") was given by the veteran dubbing artiste Roja Ramani which enhanced the said role {{and became one of}} the major highlights of the movie. She admitted in one of the interviews that {{this was one of the}} memorable movies she had dubbed for, with she having split her sides for most of the scenes involving Naresh! She so excellently modulated her voice that it perfectly suited the role and all the scenes involving Prema became invariably and hauntingly hilarious. Naresh also did great justice to the voice by his brilliant acting and beautifully getting into the skin of the character without any inhibitions usually associated with such roles that militate against natural performance. The {{voice for the}} old <b>disguise</b> <b>character</b> of Brahmanandam was given by Mimicry artist Mimicry Nageswara Rao alias Mittipati Nageswara Rao to mimic veteran actor Nagabhushanam.|$|R

5000|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures of Christopher Chance (Rick Springfield), a Vietnam War vet turned {{bodyguard}} and private investigator who uses advanced technology and sophisticated makeup to assume the identity of his client, becoming a human target. [...] In {{a departure from the}} original comic book stories, Chance flies from job to job in a large, gizmo-laden stealth aircraft known as the Blackwing. Additionally, he is assisted by computer expert Philo Marsden (Kirk Baltz), Blackwing pilot Jeff Carlyle (Sami Chester), and former CIA operative Libby Page (Signy Coleman). [...] Page coordinated Chance's missions, Carlyle also served as cook and chauffeur, while Marsden created new gadgets and developed the masks Chance used to impersonate his clients. [...] Chance took an unusual approach to compensation for his services: ten percent of his client's annual income ("whether you're a busboy or the king of England"). One reviewer described the show as [...] "50 percent Mission: Impossible (Martin Landau's master of <b>disguise</b> <b>character)</b> and 50 percent Quantum Leap (jumping into other people's lives at moments of crisis)." ...|$|R
500|$|Keaton, {{who called}} himself a [...] "logic freak", was {{concerned}} that Batman's secret identity would in reality be fairly easy to uncover, and discussed ideas with Burton to better <b>disguise</b> the <b>character,</b> {{including the use of}} contact lenses. Ultimately, Keaton decided to perform Batman's voice at a lower register than when he was portraying Bruce Wayne, which became a hallmark of the film version of the character, with Christian Bale later using the same technique.|$|R
5000|$|Peking Opera, {{also known}} as Beijing Opera, had male actors playing female dan characters. Men {{traditionally}} played women’s roles due to women being excluded from performing {{in front of the}} public. [...] Although, before 1978, male to female cross dressing was mostly for theatrical performances, used for comedic effect or to <b>disguise</b> a <b>character</b> in order to commit a crime or defeat enemies. Female to male characters were considered heroic in theatrical performances.|$|R
40|$|In {{my thesis}} project, I aim {{to explore the}} ways in which we can perform parts of our {{identity}} by hiding the body through the use of performative <b>disguises.</b> These <b>characters</b> transgress the boundaries between societal norms and abject interactions. In these costumes, I hope to find whether or not the multiple facets of our identities can be distilled into one character [...] whether the self can be shifted into another character for a constructive narrative...|$|R
50|$|On 22 November 1987, a {{broadcast}} of Horror of Fang Rock by Chicago television station WTTW was interrupted for around 90 seconds by a pirate broadcast featuring an individual <b>disguised</b> as television <b>character</b> Max Headroom.

50|$|Curt Siodmak {{was hired}} to write the script on 9 July 1940. Siodmark later argued the only element he kept from the play was of a <b>character</b> <b>disguising</b> himself as an ape; the notion of fluid taken from the spine to cure a {{crippled}} girl was all Siodmark's.|$|R
5000|$|Speculating on the problem, Scodel writes that: [...] "Three {{innovations}} {{must have}} taken place for tragedy {{as we know it}} to exist. First, somebody created a new kind of performance by combining a speaker with a chorus and putting both speaker and chorus in <b>disguise</b> as <b>characters</b> in a story from legend or history. Second, this performance was made part of the City Dionysia at Athens. Third, regulations defined how it was to be managed and paid for. It is theoretically possible that all these were simultaneous, but it is not likely." ...|$|R
5|$|Plain arms {{also often}} {{function}} as a <b>disguise</b> for major <b>characters.</b> In the Chrétien de Troyes' Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart, Lancelot bears plain red arms as a disguise. The hero of Cligès competes in a jousting tournament with plain black, green, and red arms on three successive days (Brault, 30).|$|R
5000|$|After {{the release}} of The Dark Knight Rises, Bane was parodied in Comedy Central's sitcom South Park in the episode [...] "Insecurity" [...] where several of the <b>characters</b> <b>disguise</b> {{themselves}} (such as Eric Cartman and Randy Marsh) as Bane to mob the UPS man. The mask itself was altered before the episode premiered.|$|R
50|$|The novel, {{which had}} been {{dedicated}} to Bernstein, was published 11 days before {{the stock market crash}} of 1929. Soon afterward, Wolfe returned to Europe and ended his affair with Mrs. Bernstein. The novel caused a stir in Asheville, with its over 200 thinly <b>disguised</b> local <b>characters.</b> Wolfe chose to stay away from Asheville for eight years due to the uproar; he traveled to Europe for a year on a Guggenheim fellowship. Look Homeward, Angel was a bestseller in the United Kingdom and Germany. Some members of Wolfe's family were also upset with their portrayal in the book, but his sister Mabel wrote to him that she was sure he had the best of intentions.|$|R
25|$|In 1950, {{the novelist}} and Communist Party of Australia member Frank Hardy {{launched}} a savage attack on Wren in his self-published 1950 novel Power Without Glory, in which Wren appears thinly <b>disguised</b> as a <b>character</b> called John West. The book also included characters based on other important Victorian and Australian political figures, including Victorian Premier Sir Thomas Bent and Prime Minister James Scullin, {{as well as}} Roman Catholic Archbishop Daniel Mannix.|$|R
500|$|In modern popular culture, Gaveston {{has been}} portrayed {{in a variety}} of ways. In Derek Jarman's 1991 film, based on Marlowe's play, Edward and Gaveston are {{presented}} as victims of homophobia and prejudice. In the 1995 movie Braveheart, on the other hand, Gaveston (thinly <b>disguised</b> as the <b>character</b> [...] "Phillip") is again caricatured as arrogant and effeminate. There is also an Oxford University dining and drinking club called the Piers Gaveston Society.|$|R
5000|$|On Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, the [...] "Fortress" [...] was conspicuously absent, {{presumably because}} the series' {{aim was to}} explore the idea of Clark Kent being the true {{identity}} and Superman merely being the <b>disguise</b> (therefore, the <b>character</b> would have no use for an otherworldly fortress). In the earlier issues of the John Byrne revamp of Superman, the Fortress was also absent so the show was probably following suit.|$|R
