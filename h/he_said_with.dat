25|$|The {{president}} inaugurated {{planning for}} the New Look in July 1953 by asking the incoming members of the JCS (Admiral Arthur W. Radford, chairman; General Matthew B. Ridgway, Army chief of staff; General Nathan F. Twining, Air Force chief of staff; and Admiral Robert B. Carney, chief of naval operations) to prepare a paper on overall defense policy. Although the JCS paper did not recommend any fundamental changes, the National Security Council in October 1953 adopted a key tenet of the New Look that a large-scale limited war or a general war would likely be fought with nuclear weapons. Eisenhower formally presented the New Look in his State of the Union message in January 1954 and Secretary Wilson helped to explain it. More defense for less money was possible, <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>With</b> new weapons and techniques and ready reserves of troops and materiel, the United States could support capable military forces within budget allocations that Congress was willing to provide.|$|E

Gibson similarly did not play computer games despite appearing in his stories. He wrote Neuromancer on a 1927 olive-green Hermes portable typewriter, which Gibson described as [...] "the kind of thing Hemingway would have used in the field". By 1988 he used an Apple IIc and AppleWorks to write, with a modem ("I don't really use it for anything"), but until 1996 Gibson {{did not have an}} email address, a lack he explained at the time to have been motivated by a desire to avoid correspondence that would distract him from writing. His first exposure to a website came while writing Idoru when a web developer built one for Gibson. In 2007 he said, [...] "I have a 2005 PowerBook G4, a gig of memory, wireless router. That's it. I'm anything but an early adopter, generally. In fact, I've never really been very interested in computers themselves. I don't watch them; I watch how people behave around them. That's becoming more difficult to do because everything is 'around them'." ...|$|E

2500|$|Puglisi {{was ordained}} {{as a priest}} on 2 July 1960 by Cardinal Ernesto Ruffini from Palermo. Ruffini {{regarded}} Communism as a greater threat than the Mafia. He once questioned the Mafia's very existence. To a journalist's question of [...] "What is the Mafia?" [...] he responded: [...] "So far as I know, {{it could be a}} brand of detergent." [...] This denial persuaded Puglisi of the need to challenge church authorities. [...] "We can, we must criticize the church when we feel it doesn't respond to our expectations, because it's absolutely right to seek to improve it," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>With</b> his trademark humour, Puglisi added: [...] "But we should always criticize it like a mother, never a mother-in-law!" ...|$|E

2500|$|At that time, it was {{customary}} {{for children}} to receive their First Communion {{at the age of}} twelve. (Pope Pius X would later lower this age to seven) After initial hesitation, and subsequent consultation with other priests, the parish priest agreed to permit Dominic to receive his First Communion at the age of seven, since he knew the catechism and understood something of the Eucharist. He spent much time praying and reading in preparation, asking his mother's forgiveness for anything he might have done to displease her and then went to Church. In his biography of Dominic Savio, John Bosco devotes a chapter to tell of Dominic's First Communion. He says that several years later, whenever Dominic talked of the day of his First Communion, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> joy: ...|$|E
2500|$|In a guest {{appearance}} on {{an episode of}} the ITV lunchtime chat show, Loose Women, broadcast on 17 August 2015, while discussing the upcoming Labour Party leadership election at the time, Tomlinson said: [...] "I know both of them and I know Andy (Burnham) quite well, and he was my choice right up until I went to listen to Jeremy Corbyn and I went to the Adelphi Hotel where there was 3,000 people there, the room holds 800 and were out into the streets, they couldn't get in". [...] "And everything <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> I agreed with you know, leave the National Health Service alone, get rid of Trident, stuff like that, so it doesn't matter to me who gets the Labour leadership, it really doesn't matter. But whatever happens both {{of them will be}} in the Shadow Cabinet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Slowly Vernet {{attracted}} {{notice in}} the artistic milieu of Rome. With a certain conventionality in design, proper to his day, he allied the results of constant and honest observation of natural effects of atmosphere, which he rendered with unusual pictorial art. Perhaps no painter of landscapes or sea-pieces has ever made the human figure so completely {{a part of the}} scene depicted or so important a factor in his design. In this respect he was heavily influenced by Giovanni Paolo Panini, whom he probably met and worked with in Rome. Vernet's work draws on natural themes, but {{in a way that is}} neither sentimental or emotive. The overall effect of his style is wholly decorative. [...] "Others may know better", <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> just pride, [...] "how to paint the sky, the earth, the ocean; no one knows better than I how to paint a picture". His style remained relatively static throughout his life. His works' attentiveness to atmospheric effects is combined with a sense of harmony that is reminiscent of Claude Lorrain.|$|E

2500|$|In The Gold of the Gods, von Däniken {{describes}} an expedition that he undertook through man-made tunnels within Cueva de los Tayos, a natural cave system in Ecuador, {{guided by a}} local man named Juan Moricz. He reported seeing mounds of gold, strange statues, and a library containing metal tablets, all of which he considered to be evidence of ancient extraterrestrial visitation. A local priest, Father Crespi, stewarded a collection of the gold extraterrestrial relics, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> special permission from the Vatican. Moricz told Der Spiegel {{that there had been}} no expedition; von Däniken's descriptions came from [...] "a long conversation", and the photos in the book had been [...] "fiddled". During the 1974 interview, von Däniken asserted that he had indeed seen the library and the artifacts in the tunnels, but he had embellished some aspects of the story to make it more interesting. [...] "In German we say a writer, if he is not writing pure science, is allowed to use some dramaturgische Effekte — some theatrical effects," [...] he said. [...] "And that's what I have done." [...] Four years later, he admitted that he had never been inside Cueva de los Tayos, and had fabricated the entire cave adventure. A geologist found no evidence of artificial tunnels in the area. Father Crespi's gold artifacts, according to an archeologist consulted by Der Spiegel, were mostly brass imitations sold locally as tourist souvenirs.|$|E
