40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{method to}} simulate natural exposure of roofing materials {{has been reported}} in a companion article. In the current article, we describe the results of an international, nine-participant interlaboratory study (ILS) conducted in accordance with ASTM Standard E 691 - 09 to establish the precision and reproducibility of this protocol. The accelerated soiling and weathering method was applied four times by each laboratory to replicate coupons of 12 products representing a wide variety of roofing categories (single-ply membrane, factory-applied coating (on metal), bare metal, <b>field-applied</b> <b>coating,</b> asphalt shingle, modified-bitumen cap sheet, clay tile, and concrete tile). Participants reported initial and laboratory-aged values of solar reflectance and thermal emittance. Measured solar reflectances were consistent within and across eight of the nine participating laboratories. Measured thermal emittances reported by six participants exhibited comparable consistency. For solar reflectance, the accelerated aging method is both repeatable and reproducible within an acceptable range of standard deviations: the repeatability standard deviation s r ranged from 0. 008 to 0. 015 (relative standard deviation of 1. 2 - 2. 1 %) and the reproducibility standard deviation s R ranged from 0. 022 to 0. 036 (relative standard deviation of 3. 2 - 5. 8 %). The ILS confirmed that the accelerated aging method can be reproduced by multiple independent laboratories with acceptable precision. This study supports the adoption of the accelerated aging practice to speed the evaluation and performance rating of new cool roofing materials...|$|E
