5|$|Released on August 28, 1973, Let's <b>Get</b> <b>It</b> <b>On</b> surpassed Gaye's {{previous}} studio effort, What's Going On, as {{the best-selling}} {{record of his}} tenure with Motown. The album peaked at number two on the US Billboard Top LPs chart, succeeded by The Rolling Stones's Goats Head Soup (1973), while it also managed to reach number one in Cash Box for one week, {{as well as two}} weeks at the top of Record Worlds music charts. Let's <b>Get</b> <b>It</b> <b>On</b> charted for 61 weeks on the Billboard charts, and remained {{at the top of the}} Billboard Soul Albums for 11 weeks, becoming the best-selling soul album of 1973.|$|E
5|$|On September 18, 2001, Let's <b>Get</b> <b>It</b> <b>On</b> was reissued by Motown as a two-disc deluxe edition release, {{featuring}} 24-bit digital remastering of {{the original}} album's recordings, previously unissued material and a 24-page booklet which contains the original LP liner notes by Marvin Gaye, as well as essays from Gaye biographers David Ritz and Ben Edmonds.|$|E
5|$|Though it {{was often}} hinted that Let's <b>Get</b> <b>It</b> <b>On</b> was the album Gaye had {{dedicated}} to her, Marvin has stated that this album was dedicated to Hunter, who {{is believed to have}} been in the studio when he recorded it. According to music critics, her presence may have increased the emotion in Ware's and Gaye's conception of I Want You.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the success}} of funk records such as Sly and the Family Stone's There's a Riot Goin' On (1971) and James Brown's late 1960s and early 1970s singles, Gaye's Let's <b>Get</b> <b>It</b> <b>On</b> helped further the funk genre's reach and {{influence}} in the music industry, as well as increase its mainstream appeal. Several contemporary R musicians, such as Prince, D'Angelo, and R. Kelly, were greatly influenced by its vintage sound and seductive themes, incorporating much of Gaye's musical style into their music.|$|E
5|$|I Want You {{consisted}} of Gaye's first recorded studio material since his highly successful and well-received album Let's <b>Get</b> <b>It</b> <b>On</b> (1973). While it marked {{a change in}} musical direction for Gaye, departing from his trademark Motown and doo-wop-influenced sound for funky, light-disco soul, the album maintained and expanded on his previous work's sexual themes. Following a mixed response from critics {{at the time of}} its release, I Want You has earned retrospective recognition from writers and music critics as one of Gaye's most controversial works and influential to such musical styles as disco, quiet storm, R, and neo soul.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, {{when the}} album Let's <b>Get</b> <b>It</b> <b>On</b> was reissued by Motown as a two-disc deluxe edition release, the {{original}} demo that Gaye had recorded with lyrics by Kenneth Stover was included. It has a running time of 5:12.|$|E

25|$|Marvin's final duet project, Diana & Marvin, with Diana Ross, {{garnered}} international success despite contrasting artistic styles. Much of {{the material}} was crafted especially for the duo by Ashford and Simpson. Responding to demand from fans and Motown, Gaye started his first tour in four years at the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum on January 4, 1974. The performance received critical acclaim and resulted in {{the release of the}} live album, Marvin Gaye Live! and its single, a live version of Distant Lover, an album track from Let's <b>Get</b> <b>It</b> <b>On.</b>|$|E
25|$|The album also {{provided}} another first in both Motown and R music: Gaye and his engineers had composed the album {{in a song}} cycle, segueing previous songs into other songs giving the album a more cohesive feel as opposed to R albums that traditionally included filler tracks to complete the album. This style of music would influence recordings by artists such as Stevie Wonder and Barry White making the concept album format a part of 1970s R music. Concept albums are usually based on either one theme or a series of themes in connection to the original thesis of the album's concept. Let's <b>Get</b> <b>It</b> <b>On</b> repeated the suite-form arrangement of What's Going On, as would Gaye's later albums such as I Want You, Here, My Dear and In Our Lifetime.|$|E
25|$|I will {{no longer}} {{participate}} in this transparent ploy to gather media attention for Finkelstein and his publisher. I answer all of his charges fully in Chapter 16 of my forthcoming book The Case For Peace, {{to be published by}} Wiley in August. My book deals with important and current issues, such as the prospects for peace in the immediate future. Finkelstein's deals with the irrelevant past that both Israelis and Palestinians are trying to put behind them. Let the marketplace judge our books. As far as I'm concerned, the public controversy is over and I will comment no further on the false charges leveled by Finkelstein and the UCP. Let them henceforth pay for their own publicity, instead of trying to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the cheap by launching phony attacks against me.|$|E

25|$|After the songwriting trio Holland–Dozier–Holland {{left the}} label in 1967 over royalty-payment disputes, Norman Whitfield became the company's top producer, turning out hits for The Temptations, Marvin Gaye, Gladys Knight & the Pips and Rare Earth. In the {{meantime}} Berry Gordy established Motown Productions, a television subsidiary which produced TV specials for the Motown artists, including TCB, with Diana Ross & the Supremes and the Temptations, Diana! with Diana Ross, and Goin' Back to Indiana with the Jackson 5. The company loosened its production rules, allowing {{some of its}} longtime artists the opportunity to write and produce more of their own material. This resulted in the recordings of successful and critically acclaimed albums such as Marvin Gaye's What's Going On (1971) and Let's <b>Get</b> <b>it</b> <b>On</b> (1973), and Stevie Wonder's Music of My Mind (1972), Talking Book (1972), and Innervisions (1973).|$|E

500|$|Following the {{breakthrough}} {{success of his}} socially conscious album What's Going On (1971), Let's <b>Get</b> <b>It</b> <b>On</b> helped establish Gaye as a sex icon and furthered his mainstream appeal. It produced three singles—the title track, [...] "Come Get to This", and [...] "You Sure Love to Ball"—that attained Billboard chart success. Let's <b>Get</b> <b>It</b> <b>On</b> became the most commercially successful album of Gaye's recording career, and it further expanded his creative control during his tenure with Motown. Its sexual balladry, multi-tracking of Gaye's vocals, and seductive, funk sound influenced later R artists and production.|$|E

500|$|Much like What's Going On, Let's <b>Get</b> <b>It</b> <b>On</b> {{has been}} {{included}} in {{a significant number of}} [...] "best album" [...] lists by critics and publications. It was ranked number 58 on The Timess 1993 publication of the 100 Best Albums of All Time. Blender magazine ranked the album number 15 on its list of the 100 Greatest American Albums of All Time. In 2003, it was ranked number 165 on Rolling Stones 500 Greatest Albums of All Time publication, his second highest entry on the list, as well as one of three Marvin Gaye albums to be included; What's Going On (number 6) and Here, My Dear (number 462). Let's <b>Get</b> <b>It</b> <b>On</b> was reissued that same year by Universal Music; the re-release was later given a silver certification by the British Phonographic Industry. In 2004, Let's <b>Get</b> <b>It</b> <b>On</b> was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and cited by The Recording Academy as a recording of [...] "historical significance".|$|E
500|$|Let's <b>Get</b> <b>It</b> <b>On</b> is {{the thirteenth}} studio album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Marvin Gaye. It {{was released on}} August 28, 1973, by Tamla Records. Recording sessions for the album took place during June 1970 to July 1973 at Hitsville U.S.A. and Golden World Studio in Detroit, and at Hitsville West in Los Angeles. Serving as Gaye's first venture into the funk genre and romance-themed music, Let's <b>Get</b> <b>It</b> <b>On</b> incorporates smooth soul, doo-wop, and quiet storm. It has been noted by critics for its sexually suggestive lyrics, and was cited by one writer as [...] "one of the most sexually charged albums ever recorded".|$|E
500|$|By 1975, Marvin Gaye {{had come}} {{off of the}} {{commercial}} and critical success of his landmark studio album Let's <b>Get</b> <b>It</b> <b>On</b> (1973), its successful supporting tour following the album's release, and Diana & Marvin (1973), a duet project with Diana Ross. However, similar to the conception and recording of Let's <b>Get</b> <b>It</b> <b>On,</b> Gaye had struggled {{to come up with}} an album as an appropriate follow-up. And much like Let's <b>Get</b> <b>It</b> <b>On</b> Gaye reached for outside help, this time seeking the assistance of Leon Ware, a singer and songwriter who had found previous success writing hits for fellow Motown alum, including pop singer Michael Jackson and the rhythm and blues group The Miracles. Ware had been working on songs for his own album which he would later issue under the title Musical Massage, a collection of erotic singles Ware had composed with a variety of writers, including Jacqueline Hillard and Arthur [...] "T-Boy" [...] Ross, brother of Diana Ross. When Motown CEO Berry Gordy paid a visit to Ware, the songwriter was more than happy to play Gordy his selection of tracks. After hearing a preliminary mix of the songs however, Gordy figured that Ware should let Gaye handle his material.|$|E

500|$|Such musicians as Todd Rundgren, Robert Palmer and Madonna {{have stated}} they were {{influenced}} by I Want You, while songs from the album have been sampled by such hip hop artists as EPMD to Mary J. Blige, who sampled the title track for her hit song [...] "Be Happy". The careers of neo soul and R musicians including D'Angelo, Musiq Soulchild, R. Kelly, Maxwell (particularly on Urban Hang Suite), Sade, and Prince show {{the influence of the}} soulful sound and equally romantic and erotic lyrics of I Want You, Let's <b>Get</b> <b>It</b> <b>On</b> and Leon Ware's Musical Massage. According to one critic, Ware's arrangements [...] "solidified the suite-like theme for the album." [...] Much like Let's <b>Get</b> <b>It</b> <b>On,</b> slow jam music, as well as modern soul and the quiet storm genre, are now viewed by critics to have been engendered by I Want You and by Gaye.|$|E
500|$|Gaye {{proceeded}} to record some more politically conscious material at the Golden World Records studio, known as Motown's Studio B, {{as well as}} the preliminary vocals and instrumentation for some of the material to be featured on Let's <b>Get</b> <b>It</b> <b>On.</b> Following the earlier sessions in Detroit at Golden World, Gaye recorded at Hitsville West in Los Angeles from February to July 1973. Accompanied by an experienced group of session musicians called The Funk Brothers, who had contributed to Gaye's What's Going On, and received their first official credit, Gaye recorded the unreleased songs [...] "The World is Rated X" [...] and [...] "Where Are We Going" [...] and the single [...] "You're the Man" [...] (1972) at Golden World. [...] "Where Are We Going" [...] was later covered by trumpeter Donald Byrd. Gaye had planned the release of an album titled You're the Man, but it was later shelved for unknown reasons. The songs that were to be included on it, along with other unreleased recordings from Hitsville West and Golden World, were later featured on the 2001 re-release of Let's <b>Get</b> <b>It</b> <b>On.</b>|$|E
500|$|The album {{has been}} {{regarded}} by many music writers and critics as a landmark recording in soul music. It furthered funk music's popularity during the 1970s, and its smooth soul sound marked a change for his record label's previous {{success with the}} [...] "Motown Sound" [...] formula. Let's <b>Get</b> <b>It</b> <b>On</b> has been ranked on many critics and publications' lists of the best albums of all time. In 2001, it was reissued by Motown Records as a two-disc deluxe edition release.|$|E
