5000|$|Fires are {{classified}} by the proper extinguishing agent. While water {{is used to}} <b>fire</b> <b>Class</b> A fires, using water on a class B fire (such as a grease fire) is extremely dangerous. This is because burning grease is hotter that the boiling point of water (212 degrees Fahrenheit or 100 degrees Celsius); when water is placed on grease, it creates steam which expands rapidly and splatters, causing burns and spreading the fire). Because of this, Class A fire extinguishers use water, while Class B fire extinguishers use dry chemicals (foam or powder), such as aqueous film-forming foam, multi-purpose dry chemicals such as ammonium phosphate, and halogenated agents (such as Halon 1301 and Halon 1211).

5000|$|... ==History== African-Americans {{have been}} a part of the history of the Baltimore City Fire Department dating to Smokestack Hardy and the SHC Auxiliaries {{agitating}} the Mayor for them being made permanent and paid firemen in 1949. At the start of WWII firefighters enlisted en masse and the fire auxiliaries were utilized to fight fires in Baltimore. Hardy was the first certified as a firefighter and when the returning troops reclaimed the trucks, he continued to assist. Hardy was mustered out as too old for the army in 1943. In 1953, the first civil service class to include African-Americans was inducted into the fire academy. Many of the auxiliaries were over the age limits by the time of that first class but Charles Miller, Charles L. Scott and Roy Parker went on to serve as full firefighters for the city of Baltimore. In the first class of Auxiliaries to be paid were Lee D. Babb, Cicero Baldwin, Ernest H. Barnes, Louis Harden, Earl C. Jones, George C.W. McKnight, Jr., Charles T. Miller, Roy Parker, Charles L. Scott and Lindsay Washington. Scott scored no.1 on the civil service list to be hired, out of 48 taking and passing the civil service exam and physical. Hardy and the auxiliaries continued to respond to forth alarms, setting up ladders and assisting the firefighters. Until then, the Fire Department had been described by the black auxiliaries as a [...] "private club" [...] for white males only. The reality for the new firefighters was bleak, blacks were admitted to the Fire Department but they had to deal with segregated beds, toilets and washrooms. In many cases they were not allowed to use the same kitchen spoons or mugs, drink coffee from the coffeepot or read the newspapers bought by 'community chest' funds. Some firehouses had [...] "Reserved" [...] (for Colored People) signs over tables in the kitchens, on beds and a commode. It wasn't just in Baltimore that these incidents took place, but it was a consistent theme wherever blacks were integrated into firehouse life. In 1954, Firefighter Jack Johnson becomes the first to receive the fire departments Meritorious Service Award. In 1959, the first black promoted to the rank of Engine Engineer, Herman Williams, was not allowed to operate the apparatus to a fire. He was later promoted to Chief of the BCFD by Mayor Curt Schmoke in 1992. 1960 saw the first black to be promoted to Lieutenant, James Thomas had earlier achieved the rank of Fire Pump Operator. In the BCFD, Blacks were not allowed join the local union until eight years after they broke the color line. With the full union membership of local 734 set against inducting African-Americans, plus the departmental rules stipulated that you couldn't have any other representation than local 734, blacks determined that they would have representation. As social associations were allowed, The Social Association of Fire Fighters (SAFF) began as firefighters meeting at the house of James Crockett, a member of the third <b>fire</b> <b>class.</b> The SAFF, led by Charles R. Thomas visited the Vulcan Society in NYC who counseled legal action; subsequently, with the help of the law firm Brown Allen and Watts, Labor Leader A. Philip Randolph, The NAACP, The Urban League and some white supporters, the AFL-CIO forced the Local 734 Union to bring the [...] "Negro Issue" [...] to the floor of a general membership meeting. Blacks were denied membership in the Union until 1961 and were allowed to join only after the Union charged them a 'fee' to get in. These 'fees' later were litigated and found constitutional. In 2003 seven of the last remaining recruits who served at 36 Engine House on Edmondson Avenue got together to remember the firehouse as a place where history was made. It used to be the city's fire training school and it was where 10 men broke the color line to become Baltimore's first African-American firefighters. The only member of the 3rd class of black recruits not there on that day was Chief Herman Williams. All had been members of the Vulcan blazers, the incorporated successor to the SAFF. The city officially renamed Engine Company 36 on Edmondson Avenue and Bentalou Street - where for 22 years Thomas served in uniform - the Charles R. Thomas Sr. Engine Company. It is the third city firehouse named after a black firefighter and the second after a Vulcan Blazer. In 2015 the City Council of Baltimore passed resolutions CR-7573 thru CR-7587 thanking these black firefighters for their service to the city and cited their membership in the Vulcan Blazers with the following proclamations - CR 7575 President Dixon, All MembersA City Council RESOLUTION congratulating Charles L. Scott(among others) on being one of the 1st African American Fireman(men) to serve the residents of Baltimore City and the Vulcan Blazers. The city Council had previously in 2007 recognized the Vulcans with a resolution congratulating them on 35 years of service to the city - CR 1552 President Dixon, All Members A City Council RESOLUTION congratulating Vulcan Blazers, Inc. on the celebration of its 35 Anniversary.|$|E

In {{accordance}} with increasing technological innovations in operational work, necessarily comes to changing of operational-tactical procedures {{depending on the}} type of intervention. Main goal is to enable better fire protection by the use of newly developed and available equipment and extinguishing agents. In 2002. the CAFS system for fire compressed foam (Compressed Air Foam System) was introduced in Croatia. The system allows active and preventive fire extinguishing, suitable when a fire takes on the characteristics of several types of fire. Thanks to the fine dosing of humidity foam, increase of efficiency is obtained by the use of only one tank of water on the fire trucks. This characteristic comes to the fore especially in areas with limited amounts of water. Furthermore, the quality of the foam is several times improved compared to the foam obtained in a classical method. Good adhesion to surfaces of all kinds makes compressed foam an extremely good mean of preventing spread of <b>fire</b> <b>class</b> âA â. Compressed foam can also be used as a good extinguishing agent for <b>fire</b> <b>class</b> âB â.

However better insight in foam system capabilities offers new operational-tactical procedures for fire extinguishing...|$|E

40|$|Information {{transfer}} between {{structural design}} programs This report examines whether the synchronization tool ISM {{is useful for}} structural engineers when transferring structural data between structural design programs AECOsim Building Designer and Tekla Structures. The report is written in collaboration with Byggnadstekniska ByrÃ¥n, who see the need to streamline the modeling process. In their present workflow, a constructional object is modeled separately in AECOsim Building Designer and Tekla Structures. The time required for modeling can be reduced if ISM {{can be used to}} transfer a model from one program to another. The utility of ISM is decided from certain evaluation criteria. Each criterion represents data of a constructional component that is controlled for correct synchronization. The information consists of the component profile name, geometry, coordinates, material quality and <b>fire</b> <b>class.</b> The implementation of the evaluation follows a specific workflow, where various steel and concrete components are synchronized between the structural design programs. The component data is controlled and documented in four steps. Further, it is determined whether the data is judged to be correct or not. The result show synchronized building components that do not meet the mandatory evaluation criteria. For synchronization of structures containing building components of steel, the unfulfilled criteria leads to certain limitations in the technology. However, with a few adjustments to the designer modeling techniques, ISM can be useful in the synchronization of structures in concrete...|$|E
