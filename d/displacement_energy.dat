40|$|We {{investigate}} isospin-symmetry breaking {{effects in}} the sd-shell region with large-scale shell-model calculations, aiming to understand the recent anomalies observed in superallowed Fermi beta-decay. We begin with calculations of Coulomb <b>displacement</b> <b>energies</b> (CDE's) and triplet <b>displacement</b> <b>energies</b> (TDE's) by adding the T= 1,J= 0 isospin nonconserving (INC) interaction into the usual isospin-invariant Hamiltonian. It is found that CDE's and TDE's can be systematically described with high accuracy. A total number of 122 one- and two-proton separation energies are predicted accordingly, and locations of the proton drip-line and candidates for proton-emitters are thereby suggested. However, attempt to explain the anomalies in the superallowed Fermi beta-decay fails because these well-fitted T= 1,J= 0 INC interactions are found no effects on the nuclear matrix elements. It is demonstrated that the observed large isospin-breaking correction in the 32 Cl beta-decay, the large isospin-mixing in the 31 Cl beta-decay, and the small isospin-mixing in the 23 Al beta-decay can be consistently understood by introducing additional T= 1,J= 2 INC interactions related to the s 1 / 2 orbit.

Approximately 110 keV of the total decrease of about 470 keV from A = 144 (spherical) to A = 154 (deformed) can be ascribed to deformation. No discontinuity is apparent at the transition from spherical to deformed shapes at N = 88 - 90. This is attributed to two effects: (i) rms radii increase with static deformations and with dynamical vibrations; (ii) Coulomb <b>displacement</b> <b>energies</b> depend on rms charge radii and on the rms radii of the neutron excess. The data suggest neutron deformations greater than proton deformations for A = 148 and 150 but smaller for A = 152 and 154.
