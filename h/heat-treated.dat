5|$|Cadmium electroplating, {{consuming}} 6% of {{the global}} production, {{is used in the}} aircraft industry to reduce corrosion of steel components. This coating is passivated by chromate salts. A limitation of cadmium plating is hydrogen embrittlement of high-strength steels from the electroplating process. Therefore, steel parts <b>heat-treated</b> to tensile strength above 1300 MPa (200 ksi) should be coated by an alternative method (such as special low-embrittlement cadmium electroplating processes or physical vapor deposition).|$|E
5|$|Titanium {{is not as}} hard as some {{grades of}} <b>heat-treated</b> steel; it is {{non-magnetic}} and a poor conductor of heat and electricity. Machining requires precautions, because the material can gall unless sharp tools and proper cooling methods are used. Like steel structures, those made from titanium have a fatigue limit that guarantees longevity in some applications.|$|E

40|$|A non-precious metal {{catalyst}} for oxygen reduction reaction is prepared by <b>heat-treating</b> a precursor containing acetylene black, melamine and cobalt chloride. The result shows that the method is effective, and a best catalyst {{can be obtained by}} <b>heat-treating</b> the precursor at 600 ℃ for 2 hours. In <b>heat-treating,</b> the cobalt ion is reduced to metallic β-cobalt and the metallic cobalt simultaneously facilitates the nitrogen source reacting with acetylene black to form the active sites to oxygen reduction reaction. The nitrogen source can also react with acetylene black to prepare a metal-free catalyst without the existence of cobalt at a higher temperature, but the activity of resulted catalyst is worse...|$|R

5|$|Today, silver bullion has the ISO 4217 {{currency}} code XAG, {{one of only}} four precious metals to have one (the others being palladium, platinum, and gold). Silver coins are produced from cast rods or ingots, rolled to the correct thickness, <b>heat-treated,</b> and then used to cut blanks from. These blanks are then milled and minted in a coining press; modern coining presses can produce 8000 silver coins per hour.|$|E
5|$|Aluminium {{cylinders}} {{are usually}} manufactured by cold extrusion of aluminium billets {{in a process}} which first presses the walls and base, then trims {{the top edge of}} the cylinder walls, followed by press forming the shoulder and neck. The final structural process is machining the neck outer surface, boring and cutting the neck threads and O-ring groove. The cylinder is then <b>heat-treated,</b> tested and stamped with the required permanent markings. Aluminium diving cylinders commonly have flat bases, which allows them to stand upright on horizontal surfaces, and which are relatively thick to allow for rough treatment and considerable wear. This makes them heavier than they need to be for strength, but the extra weight at the base also helps keep the centre of gravity low which gives better balance in the water and reduces excess buoyancy.|$|E
5|$|Demand for {{grinding}} {{machinery and}} specialist {{knowledge in the}} heat treatment of metals and other areas the company had developed was so high {{during the years of}} World War I that the government ordered other British manufacturers to produce Churchill designs. One specialist area was <b>heat-treated</b> blades used to cut the cables of sea mines. In April 1916 an increase in share capital to expand the factory further was authorised. During the war years the company was misled by a trade union such that it paid its male fitters, who were supervising female war workers, an increased wage of 48 shillings per week. The union told the company it was the rate paid for similar work at Armstrong Whitworth, when it was not.|$|E
50|$|Stresses in {{overheated}} aluminium can {{be relieved}} by <b>heat-treating</b> the parts in an oven and gradually cooling it—in effect annealing the stresses. Yet these parts may still become distorted, so that <b>heat-treating</b> of welded bicycle frames, for instance, {{can result in}} a significant fraction becoming misaligned. If the misalignment is not too severe, the cooled parts may be bent into alignment. Of course, if the frame is properly designed for rigidity (see above), that bending will require enormous force.|$|R

5|$|In 1986 {{individual}} Navy SEALs from a West Coast {{team had}} been using personally purchased custom fixed-blade knives made by Southern California knifemaker Phill Hartsfield. Hartsfield's knives were hard ground from differentially <b>heat-treated</b> A2 tool steel and {{are known for their}} distinctive chisel-ground blades.

Emerson had long been impressed by the cutting ability of the chisel-ground edge and had asked Hartsfield's permission to incorporate it into his own folding knives, which Hartsfield granted. When the SEALs asked Hartsfield to make them a folding knife, he informed them that he did not make folding knives and referred them to Emerson.|$|E

5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} may {{be manufactured}} from steel plate discs, which are cold {{drawn to a}} cylindrical cup form, {{in two or three}} stages, and generally have a domed base if intended for the scuba market, so they cannot stand up by themselves. After forming the base and side walls, the top of the cylinder is trimmed to length, heated and hot spun to form the shoulder and close the neck. This process thickens the material of the shoulder. The cylinder is <b>heat-treated</b> by quenching and tempering to provide the best strength and toughness. The cylinders are machined to provide the neck thread and o-ring seat (if applicable), then chemically cleaned or shot-blasted inside and out to remove mill-scale. After inspection and hydrostatic testing they are stamped with the required permanent markings, followed by external coating with a corrosion barrier paint or hot dip galvanising.|$|E

The angiotensin peptides angiotensin II and angiotensin 1 – 7 have opposing effects with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) being the enzyme predominantly responsible for generating angiotensin 1 – 7 from angiotensin II. The effect of FCS on angiotensin peptides has not previously been described. We have shown that FCS has ACE 2 enzyme activity capable of degrading angiotensin II and generating angiotensin 1 – 7. Researchers {{should be aware that}} FCS possesses ACE 2 activity and that <b>heat-treating</b> FCS to 56  °C only partially inhibits this enzyme activity, whereas <b>heat-treating</b> to 70  °C completely abolishes ACE 2 activity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Xerogel was {{prepared}} by the sol-gel method using ethyl ester orthosilicate, alcohol, carbamide and glucose with various contents as raw materials.
