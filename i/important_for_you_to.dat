First, and most important, my perspective represents a voice of an individual who has personal experience with the challenges of living with a disability. Second, I have made several successful transitions; despite struggles in high school and college, I have been employed by the federal government since earning my bachelor’s degree in 2002, and I have recently obtained a master’s degree and I am currently pursuing a PhD.

Here is a copy {{of one of the}} lost frescoes of our Painted Chamber of Westminster;--fourteenth-century work, entirely conceived in color, and calculated for decorative effect. There is no more light and shade in it than in a Queen of Hearts in a pack of cards;--all that the painter at first wants you to see is that the young lady has a white forehead, and a golden crown, and a fair neck, and a violet robe, and a crimson shield with golden leopards on it; and that behind her is clear blue sky.

40|$|Among {{the many}} hard {{questions}} that the monks of Bec put to brother Anselm, perhaps the most philosophically intriguing concerned {{the fall of the}} devil. Right around halfway through Anselm’s intricate dialogue on this subject, he has the teacher warn his student that they need to take a step back, and consider some more fundamental issues. He then remarks: It’s <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> not <b>to</b> be content merely to understand each of the things I say individually, but to gather them all up in your memory {{at the same time and}} see them in one glance, as it were (ch. 12). The imperative Anselm expresses is a familiar one: we often feel the need to get a course of thought into our heads all at once, so that we can see the argument as a whole. It is, however, quite obscure what is involved in this sort of all-at-once grasp of an argument, and under what circumstances it is possible. It is also by no means clear what is lost when we fail to see the whole argument in what we might call a single Anselmian glance. My aim is to shed some light on these questions. As a starting point, consider the even more familiar and much-discussed authority of the first-person perspective. If the question arises of what I believe or feel, it is obvious that I myself am the best source of information.

Through understanding what makes you write or prevents you from writing, you can gain control over your writing behaviours, the behaviours that are key to your ultimate performance. This chapter shows the small, simple {{steps you can take}} in order to achieve your writing potential. By exploring how to break down the barriers to writing, such as stress and anxiety, this chapter shows how writing can eventually become just another activity, and even an enjoyable habit. We discuss the reasons why writing is <b>important</b> <b>for</b> helping <b>you</b> <b>to</b> learn, and help <b>you</b> <b>to</b> explore your own reasons for wanting to write. This will help <b>you</b> <b>to</b> keep writing, even when you are finding it challenging. The environment you work in is <b>important</b> <b>for</b> developing good writing habits and enabling <b>you</b> <b>to</b> write well, so the chapter discusses how you can create your own writing den and find your favourite writing haunts. Practical tips, such as where to find your ideas from, how to start writing, how to finish your writing session, and how to plan writing for assessment are included. Suggestions on using different sources of information and inspiration for your writing, how to use feedback to improve your writing, and how to get the most from university student support services are given. Writing {{is an important part of}} your life when you are studying in health and social care.

5000|$|In 1963, Hallett {{received}} his Ph.D. from Boston University. His dissertation was entitled [...] "Ethical Issues in Urban Planning and Development."He spent that {{summer in the}} south, {{at the invitation of}} Ed King. Hallett says, [...] "I had another friend from Boston, Ed King, who was a pastor at Tougaloo College in Mississippi. ...Ed told me 16 civil rights workers had been killed—this was the summer of '63—and he felt the news wasn't being reported. ...I said, 'What can I do?' He said, 'The most <b>important</b> thing is <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> come down here. We have to get outside credible sources in here to get the news out.' I went down and spent a week in Mississippi with Ed. When I came back, I reported it to a meeting of the Church Federation of Greater Chicago. I gave probably the best speech of my life. And then we began to organize a delegation of clergy to go there from northern cities with the purpose of keeping down the violence. The clergy would come back to Detroit or Baltimore, and then there would be an article in the local papers from somebody they trusted. One after another the major metropolitan dailies started to report what was going on. Nicholas von Hoffman was a reporter for the Chicago Daily News. When we were working on desegregating churches in Mississippi, I would talk to Nick every night. Nick would suggest what to do next because he knew what would make the news. And we'd act it out. He was the only reporter I knew who'd help make the news so he could write about it."

60|$|And at {{this time}} I have endeavoured to prove to you--if you {{investigate}} the subject you may more entirely prove to yourselves--that no school ever advanced far which had not the love of natural fact as a primal energy. But it is still more <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be assured that the conditions {{of life and death}} in the art of nations are also the conditions of life and death in your own; and that you have it, each in his power at this very instant, to determine in which direction his steps are turning. It seems almost a terrible thing to tell you, that all here have all the power of knowing at once what hope there is for them as artists; you would, perhaps, like better that there was some unremovable doubt about the chances of the future--some possibility that you might be advancing, in unconscious ways, towards unexpected successes--some excuse or reason for going about, as students do so often, to this master or the other, asking him if they have genius, and whether they are doing right, and gathering, from his careless or formal replies, vague flashes of encouragement, or fitfulnesses of despair. There is no need for this--no excuse for it. All of you have the trial of yourselves in your own power; each may undergo at this instant, before his own judgment seat, the ordeal by fire. Ask yourselves what is the leading motive which actuates you while you are at work. I do not ask you what your leading motive is for working--that is a different thing; you may have families to support--parents to help--brides to win; you may have all these, or other such sacred and pre-eminent motives, to press the morning's labour and prompt the twilight thought. But when you are fairly at the work, what is the motive then which tells upon every touch of it? If it is the love of that which your work represents--if, being a landscape painter, it is love of hills and trees that moves you--if, being a figure painter, it is love of human beauty and human soul that moves you--if, being a flower or animal painter, it is love, and wonder, and delight in petal and in limb that move you, then the Spirit is upon you, and the earth is yours, and the fulness thereof. But if, on the other hand, it is petty self-complacency in your own skill, trust in precepts and laws, hope for academical or popular approbation, or avarice of wealth,--it is quite possible that by steady industry, or even by fortunate chance, you may win the applause, the position, the fortune, that you desire;-- but one touch of true art you will never lay on canvas or on stone as long as you live.|$|E
