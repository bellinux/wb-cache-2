50|$|<b>Jolly</b> Cola is an {{original}} Danish soft drink {{dating back to}} 1959. <b>Jolly</b> Cola is now produced by the Danish brewery ‘Vestfyen’, which also produces <b>Jolly</b> Light, the sports drink <b>Jolly</b> Time and <b>Jolly</b> Orange. Up until the 1980s, <b>Jolly</b> Cola had a market share of about 40% of the Danish cola market. This was extraordinary, as Denmark {{is one of a}} few countries in the world, where another cola than the original Coca-Cola has had a larger market share. <b>Jolly</b> Cola is probably most famous for its slogan “Say <b>Jolly</b> to your cola!”, but on its 50th birthday, this slogan was changed into “Free your taste”.|$|R
50|$|<b>Jolly</b> {{shows up}} late one day with {{lacerations}} on her face. LaVaughn has her mom {{come to help}} with <b>Jolly,</b> and her mom tells <b>Jolly</b> she needs to take hold {{of her life and}} criticizes <b>Jolly.</b> A few weeks later, <b>Jolly</b> comes home and announces that she was fired. LaVaughn learns that it was because <b>Jolly’s</b> boss was sexually abusing her and <b>Jolly</b> stabbed his hand with a pencil to make him stop. The boss fired her for the act. <b>Jolly</b> tries several times to file reports of sexual abuse to administration, but they ignore her calls and complaints. <b>Jolly</b> tries unsuccessfully to get a new job, and rejects LaVaughn's suggestion that she go back to school so that she can get better jobs, for fear that her children might get taken away from her.|$|R

6000|$|Jimmy, {{like his}} lordship, had been trapped at the {{beginning}} of the duologue, and had not been able to get away till it was nearly over. He had been introduced by Lady Julia to an elderly and adhesive baronet, who had recently spent ten days in New York, and escape had not been won without a struggle. The baronet on his return to England had published a book, entitled, [...] "Modern America and Its People," [...] and it was with regard to the opinions expressed in this volume that he invited Jimmy's views. He had no wish to see the duologue, and it was only after the loss of much precious time that Jimmy was enabled to tear himself away on the plea of having to dress. He cursed the authority on [...] "Modern America and Its People" [...] freely, as he ran upstairs. While the duologue was in progress, there had been no chance of Sir Thomas taking it into his head to visit his dressing-room. He had been, as his valet-detective had observed to Mr. Galer, too busy <b>jollying</b> along the swells. It would be the work of a few moments only to restore the necklace to its place. But for the tenacity of the elderly baronet, the thing would have been done by this time. Now, however, there was no knowing what might not happen. Anybody might come along the passage, and see him. He had one point in his favor. There was no likelihood of the jewels being required by their owner till the conclusion of the theatricals. The part that Lady Julia had been persuaded by Charteris to play mercifully contained no scope for the display of gems.|$|E
