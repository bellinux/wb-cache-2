[...] For instance, in the episode [...] "House Fancy", television personality Alton Brown guest starred as the character of Nicholas Whithers, the host and judge of a show of the same name. In an interview, Brown described the work as [...] "a blast." [...] He said [...] "I {{came up with this}} voice that didn't sound anything like me. I channeled this very strange person. Only three people I know figured out it was <b>even</b> <b>me</b> when they saw it." [...] Actor and musician Johnny Depp guest starred in the episode [...] "SpongeBob vs. The Big One" [...] as the voice of Jack Kahuna Laguna, a surf guru that taught SpongeBob how to surf. According to Sarah Noonan, vice president of talent and casting for Nickelodeon, Depp accepted the role because he and his kids are fans of the show. The episode was also guest starred by musician and The Monkees' Davy Jones who starred in the episode as himself, appearing {{at the bottom of the}} sea with his locker, and Bruce Brown providing vocal cameo as the episode's narrator. Brian Doyle-Murray also reprised his role as the Flying Dutchman for the episode. In [...] "The Card", Ernest Borgnine returned, reprising his role as Mermaid Man.

Furthermore, Dee Snider, the frontman of the heavy metal band Twisted Sister, guest starred in [...] "Shell Shocked" [...] as Angry Jack. Snider said [...] "I knew they must be fans [...] because in the SpongeBob movie, they took my song 'I Wanna Rock' and changed it to 'Goofy Goober Rock.' I flipped at the opportunity to be in the show. I have four kids, and everybody loved SpongeBob." [...] In the entry [...] "The Clash of Triton", English singer Victoria Beckham guest starred in the episode as the wife of King Neptune, Queen Amphitrite. The writers created the role of a Queen Amphitrite especially for Beckham.

2500|$|Wallace {{commented on}} the storyline, [...] "Before my break I had the baby-swap storyline, and {{towards the end of}} last year , Kat was {{becoming}} very downtrodden. Now she's back on the scene fighting fit—it's almost like when Kat first showed up in 2000. She's come back with those feisty, tarty, funny and slightly cold sides she had. It's actually a new Kat!" [...] She later told Inside Soap that the storyline was [...] "really exciting", calling it [...] "cleverly written so no one knows who Kat's secret lover is—not <b>even</b> <b>me</b> or the mystery man himself. I love coming into work every day and discovering even more brilliant twists to the plot!" [...] She added, [...] "Everyone is going to love the excitement of the storyline. The scriptwriters have been brilliant at putting everyone in the frame. I can't wait to find out who it is!", and said that Kat loves being the centre of attention when she charms each of the suspects to join the football team, especially as her marriage to Alfie has lost its spark. She said that [...] "Alfie has always loved Kat's sexy side, so he doesn't see any harm in [...] It's just that Kat doesn't think he has the same interest in her that he used to. Alfie just seems content with domestic life, and the passion has gone." [...] Speaking of Kat's motivation for the affair, Wallace told Inside Soap that [...] "Kat feels deflated, as [...] haven't had much alone time lately, but her mood is soon lifted when she hears the football lads chanting her name and goes back down to the bar. Later, she's cleaning in the kitchen when someone walks in. At first she thinks it's Alfie, but she's surprised to see it's one of the other team members. She invites him in—and one thing leads to another..." ...|$|E
