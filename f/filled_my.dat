500|$|Garfield {{had long}} been anxious to escape hot, {{unhealthy}} Washington, and in early September the doctors agreed to move him to Elberon, where his wife had recovered earlier in the summer. He left the White House {{for the last time}} on September 5, traveling in a specially cushioned railway car; a spur line to the Franklyn Cottage, a seaside mansion given over to his use, was built in a night by volunteers. There, Garfield could see the ocean as officials and reporters maintained what became (after an initial rally) a death watch. Garfield's personal secretary, Joe Stanley Brown, wrote 40 years later, [...] "to this day I cannot hear the sound of the low slow roll of the Atlantic on the shore, the sound which <b>filled</b> <b>my</b> ears as I walked from my cottage to his bedside, without recalling again that ghastly tragedy." ...|$|E
500|$|Modern-day {{historians have}} {{continued}} to characterize the battle as a wholesale massacre. Mark Grimsley, {{a history professor at}} Ohio State University, concluded in 2005, based on other modern accounts, that the Battle of Bad Axe would be better termed a massacre. Kerry A. Trask's 2007 work, Black Hawk: The Battle for the Heart of America, points to the writings of Wakefield as evidence that delusional beliefs about doing brave deeds and magnifying manliness spurred the U.S. forces to revel in and pursue massacring and exterminating the Sauk and Fox. Trask concluded that Wakefield's statement [...] "I must confess, that it <b>filled</b> <b>my</b> heart with gratitude and joy, to think that I had been instrumental, with many others, in delivering my country of those merciless savages, and restoring those people again to their peaceful homes and firesides," [...] was a viewpoint held by nearly all militia members.|$|E

500|$|By June, the Prussians {{had begun}} {{actively}} aiding the Russians, and on June 6, 1794, Kościuszko fought a defensive battle against a Prussian-Russian force at Szczekociny. From late June, for several weeks, he defended Warsaw, {{controlled by the}} insurgents. On June 28, a mob of insurgents in Warsaw captured and hanged Bishop Ignacy Massalski and six others. Kościuszko issued a public reproach, writing, [...] "What happened in Warsaw yesterday <b>filled</b> <b>my</b> heart with bitterness and sorrow", and urging, successfully, that rule of law be followed. By the morning of September 6, the Prussian forces having been withdrawn to suppress an uprising underway in Greater Poland, the siege of Warsaw was lifted. On October 10, during a sortie against a new Russian attack, Kościuszko was wounded and captured at Maciejowice. He was imprisoned by the Russians at Saint Petersburg in the Peter and Paul Fortress. Soon afterward, the uprising ended with the Battle of Praga, where according to a contemporary Russian witness, the Russians troops massacred 20,000 Warsaw residents. The subsequent Third Partition of Poland ended {{the existence of a}} sovereign Polish state for the next 123 years.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{recorded}} on August 13, 1990. The voice of Herb {{was provided by}} guest star Danny DeVito, an American actor who was suggested for the role by Simpsons executive producer Sam Simon. Bart's voice actor, Nancy Cartwright, writes in her autobiography My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy that DeVito had to record his lines quickly because he had another appointment, so the staff focused on recording his scenes only instead of the whole episode at once. Cartwright was a fan of DeVito's and recalls: [...] "This morning, at the table read, I had just <b>filled</b> <b>my</b> plate with assorted fruits when Bonnie said to my backside, 'Nancy, I want to introduce you to...' and I turned and practically knocked over Danny DeVito, all four feet, eleven inches of him. How embarrassing!" [...] While recording the scenes, Cartwright stood directly across the room from DeVito, which she appreciated since she got {{to see him in}} action. She thought DeVito [...] "threw his body and soul" [...] into his performance. While the recording took part, animation director Archer scribbled down some of DeVito's attitudes, gestures, and facial expressions {{on a piece of paper}} as he performed. In one scene of the episode, Herb tells Homer and the rest of the Simpson family to [...] " [...] yourselves at home. We have a tennis court, a swimming pool, a screening room..."

2500|$|Nehru {{became an}} ardent {{nationalist}} during his youth. The Second Boer War and the Russo-Japanese War intensified his feelings. About the latter he wrote, [...] " [...] Japanese victories [...] stirred up my enthusiasm... Nationalistic ideas <b>filled</b> <b>my</b> mind... I mused of Indian freedom and Asiatic {{freedom from the}} thraldom of Europe." [...] Later when he had begun his institutional schooling in 1905 at Harrow, a leading school in England, he was greatly influenced by G. M. Trevelyan's Garibaldi books, which he had received as prizes for academic merit. He viewed Garibaldi as a revolutionary hero. He wrote: [...] "Visions of similar deeds in India came before, of [...] gallant fight for [...] freedom and in my mind India and Italy got strangely mixed together." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nancy's grave {{is located}} {{in what has been}} named the Pioneer Cemetery, also known as the Nancy Hanks Lincoln Cemetery. Her headstone was {{purchased}} by P.E. Studebaker, an industrialist from South Bend, in 1878. At least twenty unmarked and eight marked graves are at the site; Nancy Lincoln is buried next to Nancy Rusher Brooner, a neighbor who died a week earlier than she from milk sickness. [...] Henry Brooner, Nancy Brooner's son and best childhood friend of Abraham Lincoln later recalled, [...] "I remember very distinctly that when Mrs. Lincoln's grave was <b>filled,</b> <b>my</b> father, Peter Brooner, extended his hand to Thomas Lincoln and said, 'We are brothers now', meaning that they were brothers {{in the same kind of}} sorrow. [...] The bodies of my mother and Mrs. Lincoln were conveyed to their graves on sleds." [...] Her aunt and uncle, also her childhood caregivers, Elizabeth (Hanks) and Thomas Sparrow are buried nearby. The cemetery is located on the grounds of the Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial, a National Historic Landmark District managed by the National Park Service in present-day Lincoln City, Indiana.|$|E

Eulenburg {{recalled}} that under his quiet demeanor that Chamberlain had a [...] "fiery spirit with those eyes and looks which speak volumes." [...] The few who knew Chamberlain well described him as a quiet, reserved man full of urbane erudition and charm; a modest, genial character with elegant manners dressed in expensive suits who could talk brilliantly and with much wit about {{a great number of}} subjects for hours. Under his polished surface, Chamberlain had a [...] "fanatical and obsessive" [...] side, whose copious notebooks and letters show a man with [...] "a profoundly irrational mind", a markedly sadistic and deeply paranoid individual whom believed himself to be the victim of a monstrous worldwide Jewish conspiracy to destroy him. Chamberlain's status as a semi-recluse was because of his fear that the Jews were plotting his murder.|$|E

2500|$|The {{uprising}} in Warsaw marked a significant {{victory for the}} entire cause of Kościuszko, and echoes of the victory in Warsaw spread across the country. Ignacy Zakrzewski became the city's commander in chief and mayor. General Mokronowski repeatedly begged the King, {{who was at the}} same time his cousin, to support the uprising. The king refused and power in the city was seized by the Provisional Temporary Council (...) composed of Zakrzewski, Mokronowski, Józef Wybicki and Kiliński. Mokronowski was soon removed from the council for his opposition to Kościuszko. On 27 May the council was dissolved, and power passed to Kościuszko's Supreme National Council (...) [...] On 9 May four prominent supporters of the Targowica Confederation, including Józef Ankwicz, Józef Kossakowski, hetman Piotr Ożarowski and hetman Józef Zabiełło, were sentenced to death by the Insurrectionary Court and were hanged in Warsaw. A few weeks later, on 28 June, an angry mob stormed the prisons and hanged other supporters of Targowica, including bishop Ignacy Jakub Massalski, prince Antoni Stanisław Czetwertyński-Światopełk, ambassador Karol Boscamp-Lasopolski and others. Felix Potocki was not found; his portrait was hoisted on the gallows instead. Kosciuszko quickly {{put an end to the}} lynch mob declaring, [...] "What happened in Warsaw yesterday <b>filled</b> <b>my</b> heart with bitterness and sorrow ...Those who do not obey the laws are not worthy of liberty." ...|$|E
2500|$|Describing the {{increase}} in his rate of killing in the two months prior to his arrest, he stated he had been [...] "completely swept along" [...] with his compulsion to kill, adding: [...] "It was an incessant and never-ending desire to be with someone at whatever cost. Someone good looking, really nice looking. It just <b>filled</b> <b>my</b> thoughts all day long." [...] When asked {{as to why he}} had preserved a total of seven skulls and the entire skeletons of two victims, Dahmer stated {{he had been in the}} process of constructing a private altar of victims' skulls which he had intended to adorn upon the black table located in his living room and upon which he had photographed the bodies of many of his victims. This display of skulls was to be adorned at each side with the complete skeletons of Ernest Miller and Oliver Lacy. The four severed heads found in his kitchen were to be removed of all flesh and used in this altar, as was the skull of at least one future victim. Incense sticks were to be placed at each end of the black table, above which Dahmer intended to place a large blue lamp with extending blue globe lights. The entire construction was to be placed before a window covered with a black, opaque shower curtain, in front of which Dahmer intended to sit in a black leather chair. When asked in a November 18, 1991 interview who the altar was dedicated to, Dahmer replied: [...] "Myself ... It was a place where I could feel at home." [...] He further described his intended altar as a [...] "place for meditation," [...] from where he believed he could draw a sense of power, adding: [...] "If this [...] had happened six months later, that's what they would have found." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sherwood wrote {{some of the}} film's {{locations}} {{into the}} script as homage to Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III. As Sherwood explains, [...] "The original Leatherface, Chainsaw 3, took {{the idea of the}} backwoods isolation of the original and exploded it tenfold. I always think of the locations of this film—the scrub brush filled badlands and remote roadside outposts as feeling like another world—a dark fairy tale land in some way. I <b>filled</b> <b>my</b> story with similar locations to hopefully capture a similar vibe." [...] The fictional Sawyer farm is a key location in Leatherface, which was rebuilt to accurately resemble its appearance in the first Texas Chain Saw Massacre. The farm was originally going to be used sparingly, until Sherwood discussed the matter with directors Maury and Bustillo. Sherwood stated, [...] "Developing the script with the directors was actually just super-easy. We knew {{what we wanted to do}} from the start, and they got it and they were right along with me. I didn't have the farmhouse a lot and they were like 'If we are going to build the set and this is the famous farmhouse, we should use it' and I totally agreed with that. And so we moved the third act, mostly taking place at the farmhouse." [...] The Sawyer homestead was adduced by cinematographer Antoine Sanier as being particularly rousing to film: [...] "It's a real house that has been shot many times, but we cannot see it very well [...] It's always a little bit hidden or dark, so it was really impressive to get into this process and also to be a link to the other guys that have been shooting this kind of set." ...|$|E
