5|$|During World War I, Berlin {{was drafted}} into the United States Army's 152nd Depot Brigade shortly after he became a {{naturalized}} United States citizen in 1918. By the time he entered the service the war was in its final months and prospects for victory were steadily improving. He was assigned to a camp on eastern Long <b>Island</b> <b>that</b> was mainly an interim station for infantry troops headed overseas.|$|E

50|$|Southeast Asia has {{numerous}} islands, with Indonesia {{being an}} archipelago of 17,000 islands and the Philippines having around 7,100. Real estate laws restrict foreigners' ability to buy {{property in the}} geographical area, and many islands either have unclear ownership rights or are already settled. Private <b>islands</b> <b>that</b> are available in Southeast Asia's real estate market are also prohibitively costly due to being in high demand by hotel developers. Developments address these difficulties by selling private <b>islands</b> <b>that</b> have villas and neighbor <b>islands</b> <b>that</b> have high-end hotels; the proximity keeps costs of habitation down.|$|R

5|$|Gameplay in Uncharted is a {{combination}} of action-adventure gameplay elements and 3D platforming with a third-person perspective. Platforming elements allow Nate to jump, swim, grab and move along ledges, climb and swing from ropes, and perform other acrobatic actions that allow players to make their way along the ruins in the various areas of the <b>island</b> <b>that</b> Drake explores.|$|E

5|$|Across the Philippines, {{the storm}} caused $4.48million (1987USD) in damage but no deaths. Although the system stayed {{offshore}} Taiwan, the storm inflicted widespread flooding across the <b>island</b> <b>that</b> took five lives. There, 5,000families were left without power, and damage exceeded $10million. Although Gerald weakened considerably prior to making landfall, {{the storm was}} still responsible for extensive damage in the Fujian Province, where 76people perished, and 31others suffered injuries. In the neighboring Zhejiang Province, 28people were killed and 71others sustained injuries. Across China, 4,900homes were destroyed and 122fatalities were reported. Damage in the country amounted to $120million.|$|E
5|$|Bartlett {{decided to}} send a team back to {{establish}} {{the exact location of}} the <b>island</b> <b>that</b> the Anderson party had approached, and to determine if Anderson had actually landed there. An injury to his knee ruled Mamen out from this mission, which was undertaken by ship's steward Ernest Chafe, with the Inuit pair, Kataktovik and Kuraluk. Chafe's group came within 2 miles (3km) of Herald Island before being stopped by open water. A careful examination through binoculars revealed no signs of the missing party, and Chafe concluded that Anderson and company had not reached the island. Chafe and his party then returned to Shipwreck Camp.|$|E
5|$|During Morgan's {{absence from}} Jamaica, news reached the <b>island</b> <b>that</b> England and Spain had signed the Treaty of Madrid. The pact aimed to {{establish}} {{peace in the}} Caribbean between the two countries; it included an agreement to revoke all letters of marque and similar commissions. The historian Violet Barbour considers it probable {{that one of the}} Spanish conditions was the removal of Modyford from the Governorship. Modyford was arrested and sent to England by Sir Thomas Lynch, his recent replacement.|$|E

50|$|Los Ladrones - Los Ladrones is a {{small group}} of four islands. The four islands are the only <b>islands</b> <b>that</b> appear above the surface. There are many <b>islands</b> <b>that</b> come up almost to the surface, some of them {{dangerous}} for boats. 300 ft channels also cut through the area, bringing in large fish and mammals.|$|R

5|$|He {{was also}} {{concerned}} by {{reports of the}} invasion of Kiska in the Aleutian Islands in August 1943, in which a large Allied force invaded an <b>island</b> <b>that</b> had already been evacuated by the Japanese. If this could happen, it was also possible that a force might attack where the Japanese were unexpectedly strong. Different levels of command sometimes came up with widely varying estimates of Japanese strength because they used different methods to estimate it.|$|E
5|$|Herm {{was first}} {{discovered}} in the Mesolithic period, and the first settlers arrived in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages. Many tombs from that period remain today, {{the majority in the}} north of the island. The island was annexed to the Duchy of Normandy in 933, but returned to the English Crown with the division of Normandy in 1204. It was occupied by Germany in the Second World War and the scene of Operation Huckaback, but was largely bypassed. Herm is currently managed by Herm Island Ltd, formed by Starboard Settlement, who acquired Herm in 2008, following fears during the sale of the <b>island</b> <b>that</b> the 'identity' of the island was at threat.|$|E
5|$|Hilton Head Island is {{sometimes}} referred to as the second largest barrier island on the Eastern Seaboard after Long Island (which is not actually a barrier island but two glacial moraines). Technically, however, Hilton Head Island is only a half barrier island. The north end of the island is a sea island dating to the Pleistocene epoch, and the south end is a barrier <b>island</b> <b>that</b> appeared as recently as the Holocene epoch. Broad Creek, which is actually a land-locked tidal marsh, separates the two halves of the island.|$|E

5|$|Internationally, George {{maintained}} {{a strong relationship}} with his brother-in-law, the Prince of Wales (eventually King Edward VII of the United Kingdom), and sought his help in defusing the recurring and contentious issue of Crete, an overwhelmingly Greek <b>island</b> <b>that</b> remained under Ottoman Turk control. Since the reign of Otto, the Greek desire to unite Greek lands in one nation had been a sore spot with the United Kingdom and France, which had embarrassed Otto by occupying the main Greek port Piraeus to dissuade Greek irredentism during the Crimean War. During the Cretan Revolt (1866–1869), the Prince of Wales sought the support of British Foreign Secretary Lord Derby to intervene in Crete on behalf of Greece. Ultimately, the Great Powers did not intervene and the Ottomans put down the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{innovations}} attributed to Andriamanelo were not his personal invention. Rather, their origins {{can be traced}} back to the southeastern part of the <b>island</b> <b>that</b> the Hova had left behind as they migrated into the central highlands. Astrology, for instance, had been introduced early to the island by way of trade contacts between coastal Malagasy communities and Arab seafarers. Similarly, archaeological evidence proves the existence of iron implements in Madagascar at least four centuries prior to the war between Andriamanelo and the Vazimba, suggesting that while the technology was not discovered during his reign, Andriamanelo may have been among the first sovereigns in Imerina to make wide-scale use of it in military campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Surtshellir, a {{group of}} {{volcanic}} tunnels in western Iceland recorded in the Landnámabók manuscript, is named after Surtr. In modern Iceland, the notion of Surtr as a giant of fire lives on; Surtsey ("Surtr's island"), a volcanic <b>island</b> <b>that</b> appeared in 1963 in Vestmannaeyjar, Iceland, is named after Surtr. The description found in Gylfaginning of Surtr guarding the frontier of Múspell is depicted in John Charles Dollman's painting The Giant with the Flaming Sword. Surtur, a natural satellite of the planet Saturn, and Surt, a volcano on the planet Jupiter's moon Io, are both named after Surtr. Surtur, a character from the American comic series Thor, is based on Surtr (1963).|$|E

5|$|The 1933 Texas {{tropical}} storm produced record rainfall in the south-central United States in July of the 1933 Atlantic hurricane season. It {{was the third}} storm of the season, developing on July14 near the Lesser Antilles. While moving westward through the Caribbean Sea, the cyclone passed just south of Jamaica on July16. The storm dropped heavy rainfall on the <b>island</b> <b>that</b> caused flooding and road washouts. On July18, the storm struck Belize and later moved across the Yucatán Peninsula. Initially {{it was believed that}} the storm continued into Mexico and dissipated while another storm formed to its northeast, but it was discovered in 2012 that the storm followed one continuous track.|$|E
5|$|The Sihanaka {{share the}} belief common {{throughout}} the <b>island</b> <b>that</b> {{the spirits of}} ancestors can possess the living, placing them in a trance state called a tromba. The Sihanaka traditionally believe that looking at a cuckoo roller (an indigenous bird) will induce the tromba. Communities look to ombiasy (wise men) for spiritual guidance, to commune with the ancestors, and to determine which days are auspicious for undertaking particular tasks or endeavors. By the 1600s, a uniform religious belief system had grown around a group of sampy (idols) believed to channel the protective spiritual power of 11 deities. The origin of these amulets {{is said to have}} been in the western territories under Sakalava control.|$|E
5|$|The Silver Strand Highway was {{constructed}} {{and open to}} the public by 1924. What would become SR75 was added to the state highway system in 1933, and designated Legislative Route 199 in 1935. SR75 was not officially designated until the 1964 state highway renumbering. The Coronado Bay Bridge opened in 1969, and provided a direct connection between San Diego and Coronado. Since then, various proposals have taken place to relieve commuter traffic between San Diego and Naval Air Station North <b>Island</b> <b>that</b> traverses the city of Coronado. However, none of these proposals have gained support, including an attempt in 2010.|$|E
