2500|$|The genome {{sizes of}} {{thousands}} of eukaryotes have been analyzed over the past 50 years, and these data are available in online databases for animals, plants, and fungi (see external links). Nuclear genome size is typically measured in eukaryotes using either densitometric measurements of Feulgen-stained nuclei (previously using specialized <b>densitometers,</b> now more commonly using computerized image analysis) or flow cytometry. In prokaryotes, pulsed field gel electrophoresis and complete genome sequencing are the predominant methods of genome size determination. Nuclear genome sizes are well known to vary enormously among eukaryotic species. In animals they range more than 3,300-fold, and in land plants they differ {{by a factor of}} about 1,000. Protist genomes have been reported to vary more than 300,000-fold in size, but the high end of this range (Amoeba) has been called into question. In eukaryotes, but not prokaryotes, variation in genome size is not proportional to the number of genes, an observation that was deemed wholly counterintuitive before the discovery of non-coding DNA and which became known as the C-value paradox as a result. However, although {{there is no longer any}} paradoxical aspect to the discrepancy between genome size and gene number, this term remains in common usage. For reasons of conceptual clarification, the various puzzles that remain with regard to genome size variation instead have been suggested by one author to more accurately comprise a puzzle or an enigma (the C-value enigma). Genome size correlates with a range of features at the cell and organism levels, including cell size, cell division rate, and, depending on the taxon, body size, metabolic rate, developmental rate, organ complexity, geographical distribution, or extinction risk (for recent reviews, see Bennett and Leitch 2005; Gregory 2005). Based on completely sequenced genome data currently (as of April 2009) available, log-transformed gene number forms a linear correlation with log-transformed genome size in bacteria, archea, viruses, and organelles combined whereas a nonlinear (semi-natural log) correlation in eukaryotes (Hou and Lin 2009 [...] ). The nonlinear correlation for eukaryotes, although claim of its existence contrasts the previous view that no correlation exists for this group of organisms, reflects disproportionately fast increasing noncoding DNA in increasingly large eukaryotic genomes. Although sequenced genome data are practically biased toward small genomes, which may compromise the accuracy of the empirically derived correlation, and the ultimate proof of the correlation remains to be obtained by sequencing some of the largest eukaryotic genomes, current data do not seem to rule out a correlation.|$|E

We thought some of the features of the traces were caused by displacement of blood from the area of the lung being examined by trapped alveolar air at a pressure exceeding those in the surrounding blood vessels.

Signal analysis of the gamma <b>densitometer</b> data revealed the presence of quasi-periodic waveforms in the time-varying multiphase flow densities and discriminatory correlations between statistical features of the gamma count data and key multiphase flow parameters. The {{development of}} a mechanistic approach to infer the multiphase flow rates from the gamma attenuation information was investigated. A model for the determination of the individual phase flow rates was proposed based on the gamma attenuation levels; while quasi-periodic waveforms identified in the multiphase fluid density were observed to exhibit a strong correlation with the gas and liquid superficial phase velocity parameters at fixed water cuts. Analysis of the use of pattern recognition techniques to correlate the gamma <b>densitometer</b> data with the individual phase superficial velocities and the water cut was undertaken.
