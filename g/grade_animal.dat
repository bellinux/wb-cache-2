5000|$|One {{emerging}} {{differentiation between}} pet food qualities in the United States {{is the use}} of standard feed <b>grade</b> (<b>animal</b> grade) ingredients versus the use of USDA-inspected, approved, and certified ingredients fit for human consumption. The USDA certification and approval process is among the best quality control programs in food production in the world. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently commented that the ingredients defined as feed in pet food (feed grade or animal grade) are not classified as generally recognized as safe (GRAS). [...] Examples of potential toxins include melamine, Salmonella, and mycotoxins. Only the language [...] "USDA certified" [...] or [...] "USDA approved" [...] is legally meaningful. Some companies will say [...] "Made with ingredients from a USDA facility", or [...] "USA Meat", which is misleading as it can include dead or dying animals or carcasses rejected from the human food chain and {{is not the same as}} USDA inspected, approved, or certified, which are FDA approved for human consumption.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Feed <b>grade</b> <b>animal</b> fat (3 or 6 %) was {{included}} in two series of laying hen rations that were based on corn, oats, barley, corn with aats or corn with barley. In the first series, the calorie:protein ratio was adjusted to a constant value while in the second series, fat was substituted for {{an equal amount of}} the grain portion with no adjustment in the calorie: protein ratios of the rations. Generally, fat was found to decrease feed consumption and improve feed efficiency. Rations with a constant calorie:protein ratio were slightly better utilized than those with wider ratios. All fat supplemented rations supported an excellent level of egg production, and there was no adverse effects of fat on laying hen performance. The "extra metabolic effect " of added fat was prominent in all rations based on corn while this effect was variable in rations based on oats or barley. Fat exerted an "extra metabolic effect " when included at a 3 % level in oat- or barley-based rations that had a constant calorie:protein ratio. This effect of fat was not observed in oat- or barley-based rations with unadjusted calorie:protein ratios or with 6 % added fat. Thus it appeared that the "extra metabolic effect " of added fat was dependent on the grain portion of the ration, the level of added fat and the calorie:protein ratio...|$|E

Pigs fed the irradiated AP 920, as well as source 1 and source 2 regular (nonirradiated) food grade plasma had increased ADG compared to the control diet. Furthermore, pigs fed irradiated AP 920, regular AP 820, regular and irradiated source 1 food grade and regular source 2 food <b>grade</b> <b>animal</b> plasma had improved ADFI compared to pigs fed the control diet. No differences in F/G were observed between treatments. No differences were detected between pigs fed diets that contained irradiated plasma compared to those fed it in the regular form.

In Exp. 2 during the experimental period (d 0 to 14), pigs fed diets containing plasma had improved ADG and F/G compared to pigs fed the control diet. Pigs fed irradiated AP 820 food grade plasma had higher ADG compared to pigs fed regular AP 820. For the overall experiment (d 0 to 24), pigs fed diets containing irradiated AP 820 had increased ADG, final body weight, and ADFI compared to pigs fed regular AP 820.

40|$|Two and a {{half years}} after the {{emergence}} of the first pandemic influenza virus of the 21 st century, we are certain there is space for improvement in the area of preparedness, and thus for mitigation. The persistence of a dogmatic approach for controlling factors underlying the emergence of influenza virus strains that are capable of both jumping the species barrier and spreading among human populations has produced negative outcomes. Such consequences range from mistrust of public health authorities to the delayed availability of vaccines. For this reason, our prediction skills must be improved, and the first step in this direction {{is to be able to}} comprehensively analyze the pandemic potential of animal influenza viruses. Paradoxically, we have the dataset, but we just do not look at it with the appropriate tools and mindset. What we need is a “One Flu ” approach. This approach includes the development of a permanent observatory (either virtual or physical), including analytic tools that can identify and <b>grade</b> <b>animal</b> strains that fulfill some or all the requisites of a pandemic virus before the virus becomes a problem in humans.

40|$|Grading of cultured {{flatfish}} {{is essential}} to maintain even sizes and to avoid potential feeding dominance or cannibalism. Current hand-grading and forced mechanical grading methods result in labour costs and additional stress to animals, reducing their growth performance. This study tested a self-grading system allowing Turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) to self-grade, based on size, between tank sections within 8000 L tanks designated as “Graded (G) ” and “Non-Graded (NG) ”. The effect on grading success (percentage of <b>graded</b> <b>animals</b> / total gradable individuals) of stimuli (light, feeding sequence and colour of the grading device) and without stimuli was analyzed over 9 days. Mean grading success without stimuli was 38. 1 ± 11. 5 %. Grading success was not improved by changes in feeding sequence (30. 6 ± 10. 2 %) or altered colour of the grading device (30. 9 ± 13. 8 %). Marked increases in grading success were obtained by adding a light source to the G section (52. 9 ± 12. 4 %), and by combining {{the presence of a}} light source and the feeding sequence (57. 9 ± 14. 4 %). The combination of light sources and changes to the colour of the self-grading device resulted in the highest mean grading success (72. 1 ± 18. 2 %) overall. Light and colour stimuli combined yielded the highest self-grading maximum (88. 36 ± 5. 3 %), achieved on day 6 after experimental onset. A three-parameter asymptotic exponential equation was fitted to the data from each stimulus and parameters describing the curves of all conditions are reported. The present results indicate that the tested self-grading systems for Turbot can be highly efficient if used with the appropriate stimuli.

Results indicate that, controlling for attributes of the animals and of the buyers and sellers, there were significant differences in prices between seasons and markets. Seasons in which farmers faced severe cash shortages exhibited the lowest adjusted prices for animals they sold, indicating that although livestock may provide a fall back position for cash in times of crisis, terms of trade may be worst when farmers need cash the most. In general, there was no clear progression in price of sheep along the primary to terminal market chain ending in Addis Ababa as would be normally expected except that the farthest market had the lowest price.

In case of goats, price differences between markets followed to some extent the expected differences between primary, secondary and terminal markets.

As New Zealand seeks to enhance its "clean green" image, farmers are coming under the scrutiny of quality conscious customers seeking to ensure that the highest standards of animal husbandry, land management and food production are practiced. Parameters for milk quality at the vat (farm-gate) are well documented and strict testing procedures are in place at milk processing sites. However, procedures and practices necessary to consistently produce finest quality milk are not so obvious. To address this shortcoming a study was conducted to design and implement a Total Quality Management (TQM) programme at Massey University's No. 4 dairy farm, a 450 cow seasonal supply dairy farm. A monthly management calendar was developed to aid in consistently achieving key farm management activities. A supplementary monthly diary sheet was also designed to allow comprehensive recording of farm and herd data that are pertinent to the assurance of product quality. Computer software was utilised to model, record and monitor farm physical and financial performance. The key attribute of the TQM programme was to ensure that staff were willing and able to implement the management systems put in place for assuring quality milk production.
