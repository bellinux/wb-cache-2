25|$|In the {{enormous}} contribution to {{language and culture}} of the kingdom, two ecclesiastics stand out, Benito Jerónimo Feijóo y Montenegro and Martín Sarmiento. Montenegro was the first to denounce the misery of the Galician peasants, proposing changes in the administration of the kingdom. Sarmiento, with extensive knowledge of botany and natural medicines, devoted himself to philology; he wrote the Catalogue of voices and phrases of the Galician language (1745–1755), and was a great defender of the Galician language, defending it against those who tried discredit it. Economic themes were also highlighted by other Galician aristocrats, such as Joseph Cornide Saavedra, Pedro Antonio Sánchez, and Lucas Labrada, as well as ecclesiastics like Francisco de Castro, and merchants like Antonio Raimundo Ibáñez. They were all authors of many works of vital importance in economic development, such Report on sardine <b>fishing</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> of Galicia (1774), and the Economic description of the Kingdom of Galicia (1804).|$|E
