Pressed by a whooping cough outbreak, loss of buffalo, deer, and bear, and loss of <b>forests</b> <b>to</b> logging, in 1851 in the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux, the Mdewakanton sold the remaining land west of the river, allowing settlement in 1852.|$|E
5|$|Allosaurus was {{the most}} common large {{theropod}} in the vast tract of Western American fossil-bearing rock known as the Morrison Formation, accounting for 70 to 75% of theropod specimens, and as such was at the top trophic level of the Morrison food web. The Morrison Formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons, and flat floodplains. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of conifers, tree ferns, and ferns (gallery <b>forests),</b> <b>to</b> fern savannas with occasional trees such as the Araucaria-like conifer Brachyphyllum.|$|E

5|$|In August 2011, the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP) {{designated}} the entire Western Ghats as an Ecologically Sensitive Area (ESA) and assigned {{three levels of}} Ecological Sensitivity to its different regions. The Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel, headed by ecologist Madhav Gadgil, was a committee appointed by the Union Ministry of Environment and <b>Forests</b> <b>to</b> assess the biodiversity and environmental issues of the Western Ghats. Gadgil Committee and its successor Kasturirangan Committee recommended suggestions to protect the Western Ghats. Gadgil report was criticized as being too environment-friendly and Kasturirangan report was labelled as being anti-environmental.|$|E
5|$|In Queensland, koalas are {{unevenly}} distributed and uncommon {{except in}} the southeast, where they are numerous. In New South Wales, they are abundant only in Pilliga, while in Victoria they are common nearly everywhere. In South Australia, koalas were extirpated by 1920 and subsequently reintroduced.

5|$|These species {{live in a}} {{wide variety}} of habitats, ranging from dry {{deciduous}} <b>forests</b> <b>to</b> rainforests, and run quadrupedally across branches. Their diet consists primarily of tree gum and other exudates, though they may obtain some of their protein and nitrogen by hunting small arthropods later at night. Three of the four species are endangered and the other is listed as vulnerable. Their populations are in decline due to habitat destruction. Like all lemurs, they are protected against commercial trade under CITES Appendix I.|$|E
5|$|Because of the Pandavas' ruined {{financial}} state, Balarama's wife, Revati, {{refuses to}} honour {{her commitment to}} marry Sasirekha and Abhimanyu and expresses her support for the alliance with the Kauravas. Krishna, who is aware of Duryodhana and Shakuni's real intentions, orders his charioteer Daaruka to take Subhadra and Abhimanyu through the <b>forests</b> <b>to</b> Ghatotkacha hermitage. Ghatotkacha, {{who happens to be}} Abhimanyu's brother, at first thinks they are intruders in his forest and attacks them but later apologises for the misunderstanding. When Subhadra explains the change in the marriage arrangements, Ghatotkacha decides to wage war against both the Kauravas and Balarama. At the urging of his mother, Hidimbi, and Subhadra, Ghatotkacha abandons his plans and is advised instead to try some trickery in Dvaraka. With the knowledge of Krishna and Sasirekha's servant, he carries the sleeping Sasirekha in her bed from Dvaraka, and flies to his hermitage. Assuming Sasirekha's form, he returns to Dvaraka and, {{with the help of his}} assistants Chinnamaya, Lambu and Jambu, wreaks havoc on her wedding to Lakshmana Kumara, preventing the marriage from being carried out.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of humans roughly 1500 to 2000years ago, lemurs were found all across the island. However, early {{settlers}} quickly converted the <b>forests</b> <b>to</b> rice paddies and grassland through slash-and-burn agriculture (known locally as tavy), restricting lemurs to approximately 10% of the island's area, ~60,000km2 (23,000sq mi). Today, the diversity and complexity of lemur communities increases with floral diversity and precipitation and is highest in the rainforests of the east coast, where precipitation and floral diversity are also at their highest. Despite their adaptations for weathering extreme adversity, habitat destruction and hunting have resulted in lemur populations declining sharply, and their diversity has diminished, with the recent extinction of at least 17species in eight genera, known collectively as the subfossil lemurs. Most of the approximately 100species and subspecies of lemur are either threatened or endangered. Unless trends change, extinctions are likely to continue.|$|E
5|$|During the {{campaign}} to conquer the Itza of Petén, the Spanish sent expeditions to harass and relocate the Mopan north of Lake Izabal and the Ch'ol Maya of the Amatique <b>forests</b> <b>to</b> the east.
