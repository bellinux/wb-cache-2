40|$|Within the EU-project SPRINT 002 German, British and Danish {{research}} institutes {{and industrial}} companies have cooperated to realise a technical concept, which {{was focused on}} the application of an abrasive water jet as a <b>fettling</b> <b>tool</b> for a robot-guided casting. The German contribution to this project was the designing, building up and operating of Pilot Cell 2. The trails of this cell have revield the potential of this new fettling technique: good quality of the automated fettled castings with a fettling time of about 2 times faster than manual fettling. Furthermore, the developed recycling system has indicated the possibility to re-use the abrasives and water in the fettling process. It is now a task for foundry equipment suppliers, to take up this new fettling technique for a commercial utilization. (orig.)
