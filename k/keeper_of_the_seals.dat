Mary of Guise had hoped to raise new taxation for a standing army and fortifications on the border, and their proposal to compile an inventory of all property and incomes was opposed.|$|E

He {{held the}} prebend of Calne in {{the diocese of}} Salisbury before {{becoming}} treasurer of Salisbury by 13 January 1239. By January 1246 he was Dean of Lincoln. His father Richard had been a royal judge. Henry's brother Robert of Lexinton was also a judge, and his brother John was a knight and clerk of the royal household, at various times seneschal, envoy, and <b>keeper</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seals.</b> Another brother was Stephen of Lexington, a Cistercian monk and abbot of Clairvaux abbey.|$|E
2500|$|Vaublanc, at {{the head}} of his ministry, engaged {{immediately}} in Counter-Revolutionary activity that was so frenetic that even the King was to be describe it as [...] "breathless devotion". On the tabling by the <b>Keeper</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Seals</b> of a law that would reestablish cours prévôtales or [...] "special courts" [...] before the Chamber of Deputies (nicknamed the Chambre introuvable), Vaublanc shouted out: [...] "France wants its King!"

60|$|The <b>Keeper</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Seals</b> gasped {{for breath}} at that, {{and his fellow}} judges murmured angrily amongst themselves. Chatellerault {{maintained}} his sardonic smile, but permitted himself to utter no word.|$|E

50|$|Bokyngham was <b>keeper</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> <b>of</b> Thomas, regent in England from March to July 1360. He {{was then}} {{appointed}} Lord Privy Seal in 1360 and held that office until 1363.|$|R

6000|$|The thought fired me like wine. I was {{no longer}} listless--no longer {{indifferent}} as to whether I lived or died. I must live.

6000|$|... "I want you," [...] said I, deeming {{the time}} ripe {{to make a}} plain tale of it, [...] "to {{withdraw}} your men, and to ride back to Toulouse without Monsieur de Lavedan, there to confess to the <b>Keeper</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Seals</b> that your suspicions were unfounded, {{and that you have}} culled evidence that the Vicomte has had no relations with Monsieur the King's brother." ...|$|E

60|$|So {{into the}} {{carriage}} she got, taking me with her, and laughing at all who showed any alarm.

60|$|But at {{ten o'clock}} a meeting was being held in the King's cabinet, {{composed}} of the King and Queen, the Baron de Breteuil, and the <b>Keeper</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Seals,</b> Miromesnil.

In reality, these puppets in the hands of destiny were helping to decide the fate of the French monarchy.|$|E
60|$|He {{answered}} me, nevertheless, {{with words}} of encouragement. No effort was being spared, and if Rodenard and my men {{were still in}} Languedoc then was every likelihood {{that they would be}} brought to Toulouse in time. Then he added that that, however, was not the sole object of his visit. A lady had obtained permission of the <b>Keeper</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Seals</b> to visit me, and she was waiting to be admitted.|$|E
50|$|His suspicions were {{especially}} focussed on several prominent members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boyar court, Alexis Basmanov and his son, Nikita Funikov (the treasurer), Viskovaty (<b>the</b> <b>keeper</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seal),</b> Semeon Yakovlev, Vasily Stepanov (the crown secretary), Andrei Vasiliev, and Prince Afanasy Viazemsky.|$|R

I will go to the <b>Keeper</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Seals</b> again, monsieur, and I will beg him to be merciful, and at least to delay the sentence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{my orders}} from the <b>Keeper</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Seals,</b> to effect the {{apprehension}} of Monsieur de Lesperon; and to deliver him up, alive or dead, at Toulouse. So that I do this, the manner of it is my own affair, and who presumes to criticize my methods censoriously impugns my honour and affronts me. And who affronts me, monsieur, be he whosoever he may be, renders me satisfaction. I beg that you will bear that circumstance in mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|Chatellerault's cynical smile grew broader as {{my speech}} {{proceeded}} and stirred up the rancour {{in the hearts}} of those august gentlemen. The <b>Keeper</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Seals</b> went white and red by turns, and when I paused there was an impressive silence that lasted for some moments. At last the President leant over to confer in a whisper with Chatellerault. Then, in a voice forcedly calm--like the calm of Nature when thunder is brewing--he asked me, [...] "Who do you insist that you are, monsieur?" ...|$|E

Unless you intervene, Bardelys, the Vicomte de Lavedan is doomed and his family houseless." ...|$|E
60|$|Christmas carols {{had been}} sung {{to them by}} nurses and mothers and grandmothers; the Christmas holly spoke to them from every berry and prickly leaf, full of dearest {{household}} memories.

Elder Brewster himself had been a rising young diplomat in the court of Elizabeth, in the days when the Lord <b>Keeper</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Seals</b> led the revels of Christmas as Lord of Misrule.|$|E
60|$|It {{is because}} of this [the letter proceeded] that I have refrained from coming {{face to face with}} you this morning.

To my respect, then, to Monsieur le Vicomte and to my own devotion to the Cause we mutually serve do you owe it that you still live.
