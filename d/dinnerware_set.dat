50|$|Vernon {{continued}} to hire well-known artists {{to create new}} dinnerware patterns. Rockwell Kent designed three <b>dinnerware</b> <b>sets</b> based on his famous woodcuts: Salamina, Moby Dick, & Our America. Don Blanding, a Hawaiian poet and illustrator designed four basic tropical design patterns for tableware. Vernon Kilns signed a contract in 1940 with Walt Disney Productions to make figurines based on Walt Disney's films: Fantasia, Dumbo, and The Reluctant Dragon. Vernon also manufactured art ware based on the film Fantasia.|$|R
50|$|In 1928, Eva Striker {{became the}} {{designer}} for the Schramberger Majolikafabrik in the Black Forest region of Germany {{where she worked}} {{for about two years}} creating many playfully geometric designs for <b>dinnerware,</b> tea <b>sets,</b> vases, inkwells and other ceramic items. Her designs at Schramberg were largely influenced by modern architecture. In addition, she had just learned to draft with compass and ruler and was proud to put them to use. In 1930, Eva moved to Berlin, designing for the Carstens factories.|$|R
50|$|Bing & Grøndahl {{was founded}} on April 15, 1853, by Grøndahl, who was a figurine maker for the Royal Danish Porcelain Factory, and the Bing brothers, who were art and book dealers. The factory was located {{on the corner of}} Vesterbrogade and Rahbek Allé in the Vesterbro area, at that time outside the city of Copenhagen, Denmark. Grøndahl {{initially}} began the company to produce bisque figurines modeled on the neoclassical sculptures of Thorvaldsen. The company extended production to include high style <b>dinnerware</b> and coffee <b>sets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Another {{study showed}} that people [...] "felt more {{grateful}} for a $45 dollar gift card than a $55 dollar coat." [...] More oddly, they [...] "were happier with a 24-piece <b>dinnerware</b> <b>set</b> that was intact than a 31-piece set, a couple of pieces of which was broken. The 31-piece set contained all {{the pieces of the}} 24-piece set, and all of them were intact. This made no difference to the recipients. All they could see was the loss of the broken pieces." ...|$|E
5000|$|In a 1998 study, Hsee, a {{professor}} at the Graduate School of Business of The University of Chicago, discovered a less-is-better effect in three contexts: [...] "(1) a person giving a $45 scarf as a gift was perceived to be more generous than one giving a $55 coat; (2) an overfilled ice cream serving with 7 oz of ice cream was valued more than an underfilled serving with 8 oz of ice cream; (3) a <b>dinnerware</b> <b>set</b> with 24 intact pieces was judged more favourably than one with 31 intact pieces (including the same 24) plus a few broken ones." ...|$|E
5000|$|Robert Copsey of Digital Spy {{gave the}} song a very {{positive}} review: [...] Tempah makes abundantly clear on single number three that success wasn't handed to him on a platinum <b>dinnerware</b> <b>set</b> marked 'Doulton'. Au contraire, it was an exhausting journey of [...] "believing and praying" [...] in a dream that, for a time, [...] "wasn't going nowhere" [...] - and with his ear-snagging rhymes cloaked in a stadium-sized chorus courtesy of US newbie Eric Turner, we're all {{going to hear about}} it whether we want to or not. Oh Tinie, we'll never doubt your work hard, play hard mentality again[...]|$|E
5000|$|Zeisel stopped {{designing}} {{during the}} 1960s and 1970s, {{to work on}} American history writing projects, returning {{to work in the}} 1980s. Many of her recent designs have found the same success as her earlier designs. Zeisel’s recent designs have included glassware, ceramics, furniture and lamps for The Orange Chicken, porcelain, crystal and limited-edition prints for KleinReid, glasses and giftware for Nambé, a teakettle for Chantal, furniture and gift-ware for Eva Zeisel Originals, rugs for The Rug Company, one of Crate and Barrel’s best selling dinner services [...] "Classic-Century" [...] (which combines some pieces from both [...] "Tomorrow's Classic" [...] and [...] "Fantasy" [...] lines) and a coffee table and stoneware / <b>dinnerware</b> <b>set</b> for Design Within Reach. [...] "Classic-Century" [...] is an updated version of the Hallcraft sets, most of the pieces made from the original molds (dishwasher safe).|$|E
5000|$|Philipp Rosenthal, born March 6, 1855 in Werl, Germany, {{was the son}} of the {{porcelain}} merchant Abraham Rosenthal and Emilie Rosenthal, (born Meyer). Rosenthal was educated in his father's company and went to the USA at the age of 18, where he became {{the porcelain}} buyer of the Detroit-based porcelain import company Jacob Meyer Brothers. On his business trips looking for painted porcelain, he realized painted porcelain was a scarce commodity. So he decided in 1879 to return to Germany and open a porcelain painting shop. He started with two painters in Erkersreuth Castle using white porcelain from the porcelain factory Lorenz Hutschenreuther in neighboring Selb [...] The unexpected breakthrough, however, succeeded commercially with the ashtray [...] "little resting place for burning cigars". After a short time, Rosenthal employed 60 employees, moved the company to Selb, and opened its own porcelain factory there in 1889. Rosenthal expanded the company through new start-ups and acquisitions and converted it into Philipp Rosenthal & Co. AG in 1897. In 1916, Rosenthal introduced the eight- and twelve-sided dodecagon porcelain <b>dinnerware</b> <b>set</b> [...] "Maria," [...] which Rosenthal named after his second wife, Maria Franck, who was the daughter of the royal lawyer Josef Frank. She had divorced Frank in 1916 {{in order to be able}} to marry Rosenthal, who was much older. Rosenthal had two sons from his marriage to Maria, Philip Rosenthal and step-son Udo Franck-Rosenthal.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{demonstrates a}} less-is-better e€ect in three contexts: (1) a person giving a $ 45 scarf {{as a gift}} was perceived to be more generous than one giving a $ 55 coat; (2) an over®lled ice cream serving with 7 oz of ice cream was valued more than an under®lled serving with 8 oz of ice cream; (3) a <b>dinnerware</b> <b>set</b> with 24 intact pieces was judged more favourably than one with 31 intact pieces (including the same 24) plus a few broken ones. This less-is-better e€ect occurred only when the options were evaluated separately, and reversed itself when the options were juxtaposed. These results are {{explained in terms of}} the evaluability hypothesis, which states that separate evaluations of objects are often in¯uenced by attributes which are easy to evaluate rather than by those which are important...|$|E
