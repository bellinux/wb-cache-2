25|$|This {{area has}} some of the fastest growing economies in the world, mostly due to a boom in oil and natural gas {{revenues}} coupled with a building and investment boom backed by decades of saved petroleum revenues. In an effort to build a tax base and economic foundation before the reserves run out, the UAE's investment arms, including Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, retain over $900 billion in assets.

25|$|If global {{oil prices}} remain high, {{it is likely}} that Canada will become one of the largest oil {{producers}} in the world in the next few decades. If so, there will be environmental issues, resulting more from the vast scale of the operations rather than the toxicity of the products. The oil sands deposits are roughly the size of Florida and the operations would drastically alter the landscape, which until recently was largely wilderness. In addition, concerns have been raised about water supplies, since the mines and steam projects would use {{a large portion of the}} flow of several major rivers. The most serious problem in the short term is an acute labor and housing shortage which has driven vacancy rates in the oil sands area to zero and wages to extremely high levels. However, given the <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> in revenue expected to be generated by the oil sands in the next few decades, {{it is likely that}} future projects will be approved regardless of the problems.|$|E

2500|$|In 2008, {{a series}} of related {{economic}} disasters hit the American and European financial systems. The bursting of a worldwide bubble in housing set the recession in motion. The end of housing bubbles in California, Florida and Arizona led {{to the collapse of}} housing prices and the shrinkage of construction sector. Millions of mortgages (averaging about $200,000 each) had been bundled into securities called collateralized debt obligations that were resold worldwide.

[...] It is also argued that inequities between employers would be reduced. [...] Also, for example, cancer patients {{are more likely to}} be diagnosed at Stage I where curative treatment is typically a few outpatient visits, instead of at Stage III or later in an emergency room where treatment can involve years of hospitalization and is often terminal. [...] Others have estimated a long-term savings amounting to 40% of all national health expenditures due to preventative health care, although estimates from the Congressional Budget Office and The New England Journal of Medicine have found that preventative care is more expensive.|$|E
2500|$|Gates' tenure {{with the}} Obama {{administration}} included a huge shift in military spending. [...] In April 2009, Gates proposed a large shift in budget priorities in the U.S. Department of Defense 2010 budget. The budget cuts included many programs geared toward conventional warfare, {{such as the}} end of new orders of the F-22 Raptor, and further development of Future Combat Systems manned vehicles. However, these cuts were counterbalanced by increases in funding for programs like the special forces. Gates called this the [...] "nation's first truly 21st century defense budget." [...] In late April 2010, he suggested the Navy cease funding development of a new multibillion-dollar ballistic missile submarine program on the grounds of cost and relevancy. He has suggested the <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> would be better spent on a new generation of vessels tailored to the threats and tactics more likely to be faced, noting, [...] "Mark my words, the Navy and Marine Corps must be willing to re-examine and question basic assumptions in light of evolving technologies, new threats and budget realities."

Official Estonian sources maintain that Soviet rule had significantly slowed Estonia's economic growth, resulting in a wide wealth gap in comparison with its neighboring countries (e.g., Finland, Sweden). For example, Estonian economy and standard of living were {{similar to that in}} Finland prior to World War II.

2500|$|In July 2007, turmoil {{that had}} been {{affecting}} the mortgage markets spilled over into the leveraged finance and high-yield debt markets. The markets had been highly robust {{during the first six}} months of 2007, with highly issuer friendly developments including PIK and PIK Toggle (interest is [...] "Payable In Kind") and covenant light debt widely available to finance large leveraged buyouts. July and August saw a notable slowdown in issuance levels in the high yield and leveraged loan markets with only few issuers accessing the market. Uncertain market conditions led to a significant widening of yield spreads, which coupled with the typical summer slowdown led many companies and investment banks to put their plans to issue debt on hold until the autumn. However, the expected rebound in the market after Labor Day 2007 did not materialize and the lack of market confidence prevented deals from pricing. By the end of September, the full extent of the credit situation became obvious as major lenders including Citigroup and UBS AG announced major writedowns due to credit losses.

[...] As described in the preceding sections, the utility of D/H ratios highest when combined with measurements of other isotope ratios as well. [...] In an early study on the stable isotope compositions of tropicamide, hydrocortisone, quinine and tryptophan, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopes were analyzed by EA-IRMS and clear distinctions were able to be made between manufacturers and even batches of the drugs based on their isotope signatures. [...] In this study {{it was determined that}} the hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios were the two best fingerprints for distinguishing between different drug sources. [...] A follow-up study analyzing naproxen from various lots and manufacturers also showed similar ability to distinguish between sources of the drugs. [...] The use of these isotope signatures could not only be used to distinguish between different manufacturers, but also between different synthetic pathways for the same compound. [...] These studies relied on the natural variations that occurred in the synthesis of these drugs, but other studies have used starting ingredients that are intentionally labelled D and 13C, and showed that these labels could be traced into the final pharmaceutical product. [...] D/H ratios can also be determined for specific sites in a drug by 2H NMR, and has been used to distinguish between different synthetic methods for ibuprofen and naproxen in one study, and prozac and fluoxetine in another. [...] These studies show that bulk D/H ratio information for EA-IRMS, and site-specific D/H ratios from 2H NMR have great utility for pharmaceutical drug authenticity testing.|$|E
