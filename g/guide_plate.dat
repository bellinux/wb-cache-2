40|$|Abstract. Defects such {{as black}} spots and yellow {{surfaces}} {{appeared in the}} process of injection molding light <b>guiding</b> <b>plate</b> {{as a result of the}} failure surfaces of the screw and screw tip. To choose and optimize the solutions of different surface treatments of the special screw for light <b>guiding</b> <b>plate,</b> the stripping performance testing platform was established. The experimental results showed that TiN and TiAlN or similar coatings by physical vapor deposition could significantly reduce the adhesion force between polycarbonate (PC) and different coatings. Through surface topography analysis of diversified coatings with SEM and AFM, TiAlN coatings represented the excellent surface quality of its smoothness, continuum, and low surface wave. To enhance the bonding force between the molding screw and coatings, TiAlN/Cr and TiAlN/Ti multi-films was developed which owned much more firm bonding force than TiAlN and good surface quality to be suitable for the special screw for manufacturing light <b>guiding</b> <b>plate.</b> 1...|$|R

50|$|These {{machines}} can {{be highly}} durable. When they do wear out, it is generally due to ink invading the <b>guide</b> <b>plate</b> of the print head, causing grit to adhere to it; this grit slowly causes the channels in the <b>guide</b> <b>plate</b> to wear from circles into ovals or slots, providing less and less accurate guidance to the printing wires. Eventually, even with tungsten blocks and titanium pawls, the printing becomes too unclear to read, a common problem when users failed to maintain the printer with regular cleaning as outlined in most user manuals.|$|E

40|$|Fiber orientations in {{graphite}} epoxy laminates {{of various}} configura-tions are investigated by imaging flow patterns of leaky <b>guided</b> <b>plate</b> waves. The plate wave flow pattern (PWFP) technique {{shows that the}} <b>guided</b> <b>plate</b> waves in laminated fiber reinforced composites tend to travel along the preferred fiber directions, {{rather than in the}} direction of impingement, especially for inhomogeneous ply layups. This method utilizes two transducers, a transmitter and receiver in a pitch-catch mode, fixed at the same oblique angle. The flow patterns for multi-ply laminates were mapped, and a global view of the ply directions was ob-tained. A frequency analysis of the ensuing signal showed that selective imaging of the fiber orientations in a multi-layered composite is feasible...|$|R

5000|$|Fine {{blanking}} presses {{are similar}} to other metal stamping presses, {{but they have a}} few critical additional parts. A typical compound fine blanking press includes a hardened die punch (male), the hardened blanking die (female), and a <b>guide</b> <b>plate</b> of similar shape/size to the blanking die. The <b>guide</b> <b>plate</b> is the first applied to the material, impinging the material with a sharp protrusion or stinger {{around the perimeter of the}} die opening. Next a counter pressure is applied opposite the punch, and finally the die punch forces the material through the die opening. Since the <b>guide</b> <b>plate</b> holds the material so tightly, and since the counter pressure is applied, the material is cut in a manner more like extrusion than typical punching. Mechanical properties of the cut benefit similarly with a hardened layer at the cut edge of the part. [...] Because the material is so tightly held and controlled in this setup, part flatness remains very true, distortion is nearly eliminated, and edge burr is minimal. Clearances between the die and punch are generally around 1% of the cut material thickness, which typically varies between 0.5 - 13 mm. Currently parts as thick as 19 mm can be cut using fine blanking. Tolerances between ±0.0003 - 0.002 in are possible, depending on base material thickness and tensile strength, and part layout.|$|E

A new technology named Equipment Integrated PM 2. 5 and Mercury Removal with low investment and high removal efficiency is developed and simulated.

For the outer filtering bags and inner filtering bags in bag filter, the uniformity of flow is got with <b>guide</b> <b>plates.</b> The resistance is lower with <b>guide</b> <b>plates</b> than without them. Flow in the AC absorber is uniform along the height from simulation. So it can equally absorb mercury. One AC absorber can operate for many days and can be replaced easily for regeneration.
