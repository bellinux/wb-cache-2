500|$|In the 18th century, the Scottish Enlightenment {{brought the}} country to the front of {{intellectual}} achievement in Europe. Perhaps the poorest country in Western Europe in 1707, Scotland reaped the economic benefits of free trade within the British Empire together with the intellectual benefits of a highly developed university system. Under these twin stimuli, Scottish thinkers began questioning assumptions previously taken for granted; and with Scotland's traditional connections to France, then in the throes of the Enlightenment, the Scots began developing a uniquely practical branch of humanism to the extent that Voltaire said [...] "we look to Scotland <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> ideas of civilization".|$|E
500|$|The Scottish Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution made Scotland into an intellectual, {{commercial}} and industrial powerhouse–so much so Voltaire said [...] "We look to Scotland <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> ideas of civilisation." [...] With the demise of Jacobitism {{and the advent of}} the Union, thousands of Scots, mainly Lowlanders, took up numerous positions of power in politics, civil service, the army and navy, trade, economics, colonial enterprises and other areas across the nascent British Empire. Historian Neil Davidson notes [...] "after 1746 there was an entirely new level of participation by Scots in political life, particularly outside Scotland." [...] Davidson also states [...] "far from being 'peripheral' to the British economy, Scotland – or more precisely, the Lowlands – lay at its core." ...|$|E

2500|$|To {{argue in}} favor of this thesis, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, a {{prominent}} German philosopher, says, [...] "The senses, although they are necessary <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> actual knowledge, are not sufficient to give us the whole of it, since the senses never give anything but instances, that is to say particular or individual truths. Now all the instances which confirm a general truth, however numerous they may be, are not sufficient to establish the universal necessity of this same truth, for it does not follow that what happened before will happen in the same way again. … From which it appears that necessary truths, such as we find in pure mathematics, and particularly in arithmetic and geometry, must have principles whose proof does not depend on instances, nor consequently on the testimony of the senses, although without the senses it would never have occurred to us to think of them…" ...|$|E
2500|$|Events {{elsewhere}} {{were now}} to have major consequences {{for the war in}} Italy. With Villeroi's crushing defeat by Marlborough at the Battle of Ramillies on 23 May, Louis XIV recalled Vendôme north to take command of French forces in Flanders. It was a transfer that Saint-Simon considered something of a deliverance for the French commander who was [...] "now beginning to feel the unlikelihood of success [...] … for Prince Eugene, with the reinforcements that had joined him after the Battle of Calcinato, had entirely changed the outlook in that theatre of the war." [...] The Duke of Orléans, under the direction of Marsin, replaced Vendôme, but indecision and disorder in the French camp led to their undoing. After uniting his forces with Victor Amadeus at Villastellone in early September, Eugene attacked, overwhelmed, and decisively defeated the French forces besieging Turin on 7 September. Eugene's success broke the French hold on northern Italy, and the whole Po valley fell under Allied control. Eugene had gained a victory as signal as his colleague had at Ramillies—"It is impossible for me to express the joy it has given me;" [...] wrote Marlborough, [...] "for I not only esteem but I really love the prince. This glorious action must bring France so low, that if our friends could but be persuaded to carry on the war with vigour one year longer, we cannot fail, with the blessing of God, to have such a peace as will give us quiet <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> days." ...|$|E

2500|$|Boesch was a {{physical}} training fanatic whose dog tag listed [...] "PT" [...] as his religion and who through the decades {{gained a reputation}} for leading grueling runs that men would {{look for ways to}} get out of by faking injuries or hiding in bushes. [...] In former SEAL James Watson's 1995 memoir Point Man, he states of 1964 training that, [...] "We had to be physically fit to perform what was expected of us. And <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> trying , Rudy Boesch made sure that we stayed in condition." [...] Kevin Dockery's 2003 work Navy Seals: A History Part III – Post-Vietnam to the Present includes three different SEALs relating how, when Boesch was 50 to 57 years old, he could keep up with or surpass trainees less than half his age in five-mile runs, obstacle courses, and open sea swimming. [...] In his 2011 memoir, SEAL Team Six: Memoirs of an Elite Navy SEAL Sniper, former SEAL Howard E. Wasdin tells of being assigned to SEAL Team TWO in the late 1980s, where Boesch, though nearly 60 years old, nevertheless ran with the trainees over an obstacle course; he then made every person who finished behind him run it again. [...] Even Boesch's physical appearance made a mark: [...] Wasdin refers to him as an exemplar of military form, Wasdin describes him as having [...] "a perfect crew cut", another account talks of his haircut and uniform being perfect at 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning, and in 2002's One Perfect Op, former SEAL Dennis Chalker said that among SEALs based on the U.S. East Coast in the late 1970s, the style was known as a [...] "Rudy Boesch haircut" [...] and was even more severe than normal military cuts.|$|E
2500|$|Historian Jonathan Israel {{argues that}} by 1750 Scotland's major cities had created an {{intellectual}} infrastructure of mutually supporting institutions, such as universities, reading societies, libraries, periodicals, museums and masonic lodges. The Scottish network was [...] "predominantly liberal Calvinist, Newtonian, and 'design' oriented in character which {{played a major}} role in the further development of the transatlantic Enlightenment [...]" [...] In France Voltaire said [...] "we look to Scotland <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> ideas of civilization," [...] and the Scots in turn paid close attention to French ideas. Historian Bruce Lenman says their [...] "central achievement was a new capacity to recognize and interpret social patterns." [...] The first major philosopher of the Scottish Enlightenment was Francis Hutcheson, who held the Chair of Philosophy at the University of Glasgow from 1729 to 1746. A moral philosopher who produced alternatives to the ideas of Thomas Hobbes, one of his major contributions to world thought was the utilitarian and consequentialist principle that virtue is that which provides, in his words, [...] "the greatest happiness for the greatest numbers". Much of what is incorporated in the scientific method (the nature of knowledge, evidence, experience, and causation) and some modern attitudes towards the relationship between science and religion were developed by his protégés David Hume and Adam Smith. Hume became a major figure in the skeptical philosophical and empiricist traditions of philosophy. He and other Scottish Enlightenment thinkers developed what he called a 'science of man', which was expressed historically in works by authors including James Burnett, Adam Ferguson, John Millar and William Robertson, all of whom merged a scientific study of how humans behave in ancient and primitive cultures with a strong awareness of the determining forces of modernity. Modern sociology largely originated from this movement and Hume's philosophical concepts that directly influenced James Madison (and thus the U.S. Constitution) and when popularised by Dugald Stewart, would be the basis of classical liberalism. Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations, often considered the first work on modern economics. It had an immediate impact on British economic policy and in the 21st century still framed discussions on globalisation and tariffs. The focus of the Scottish Enlightenment ranged from intellectual and economic matters to the specifically scientific as in the work of the physician and chemist William Cullen, the agriculturalist and economist James Anderson, chemist and physician Joseph Black, natural historian John Walker and James Hutton, the first modern geologist.|$|E
