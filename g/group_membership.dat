40|$|AbstractThis study {{explored}} {{associations between}} <b>group</b> <b>memberships</b> and recovery capital amongst 20 young adults aged 18 to 21 years in residential {{alcohol and drug}} treatment. MethodParticipants completed an interviewer administered research interview based on measures of recovery capital and a social networks assessment mapping <b>group</b> <b>memberships,</b> <b>group</b> substance use, and relationships between groups. ResultsHigher personal and social recovery capital was associated with lower diversity of <b>group</b> <b>memberships,</b> a higher number of positive links between groups, and greater compatibility of lower substance-using groups with other groups in the network. Higher compatibility of heavier-using groups was also associated with having a higher number of negative, antagonistic ties between groups. ConclusionsThese findings indicate that it is higher compatibility of a lower substance-using social identity and lower-using <b>group</b> <b>memberships</b> that contributes to recovery capital. Further, positive ties between groups and lower diversity of <b>group</b> <b>memberships</b> appear to be key aspects in how multiple social identities that are held by young adults relate to personal and social recovery capital...|$|R
40|$|A survey {{study of}} {{patients}} recovering from stroke (N = 53) examined {{the extent to}} which belonging to multiple groups prior to stroke and the maintenance of those <b>group</b> <b>memberships</b> (as measured by the Exeter Identity Transitions Scales, EXITS) predicted well-being after stroke. Results of correlation analysis showed that life satisfaction was associated both with multiple <b>group</b> <b>memberships</b> prior to stroke and with the maintenance of <b>group</b> <b>memberships.</b> Path analysis indicated that belonging to multiple groups was associated with maintained well-being because there was a greater likelihood that some of those memberships would be preserved after stroke-related life transition. Furthermore, it was found that cognitive failures compromised well-being in part because they made it hard for individuals to maintain <b>group</b> <b>memberships</b> post-stroke. These findings highlight the importance of social identity continuity in facilitating well-being following stroke and, more broadly, show the theoretical contribution that a social identity approach to mental health can make in the context of neuropsychological rehabilitation...|$|R

PURPOSE: The postpartum period presents the highest risk for women's mental health throughout the lifespan. We aimed to examine the Social Identity Model of Identity Change in this context. More specifically, we investigated changes in social identity during this life transition and their consequences for women's postpartum mental health. METHODS: Women who had given birth within the last  12  months (N =  387) reported on measures of depression, social <b>group</b> <b>memberships,</b> and motherhood identification. RESULTS: Analyses indicated that a decrease in <b>group</b> <b>memberships</b> after having a baby, controlling for <b>group</b> <b>memberships</b> prior to birth, was associated {{with an increase in}} depressive symptomology. However, maintaining pre-existing <b>group</b> <b>memberships</b> was predictive of better mental health. New <b>group</b> <b>memberships</b> were not associated with depressive symptomology. Identification as a mother was a strong positive predictor of mental health in the postpartum period. CONCLUSIONS: The social identity model of identity change provides a useful framework for understanding postpartum depression. Interventions to prevent and treat postpartum depression might aim to support women in maintaining important social group networks throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period.

40|$|People {{respond to}} {{rejection}} with a complex range of motives and behaviours. In particular, {{the experience of}} rejection can produce shifts in mood and elicit hostility and aggression, and increased antisocial behaviour. Establishing effective means of moderating the effects of rejection will contribute to both public health and interpersonal conflict resolution. Consistent with research that conceptualises rejection {{as a threat to}} belonging, the present study employed an experimental design to examine the buffering effect of people’s <b>group</b> <b>memberships</b> on their reactions to rejection. It was hypothesized that as a greater number of <b>group</b> <b>memberships</b> were made salient, the negative effects of rejection would correspondingly decrease, and the positive effects would increase. Participants were randomly allocated to one of four <b>group</b> <b>memberships</b> conditions, in which either zero (N= 27), one (N= 28), three (N= 26) or five (N= 26) social category <b>group</b> <b>memberships</b> were made salient utilizing a free-response task, which involved participants writing about ‘why each group was important to them’. An experience of rejection was then created by falsely informing participants that they weren’t sufficiently liked by others in the experiment to be chosen to work collaboratively on a task. Participants then completed self-report measures of mood and group identification, an attribution perception task and behavioural measures of aggression and executive functioning. Results indicate that when a greater number of <b>group</b> <b>memberships</b> were made salient, participants demonstrated increased loyalty, decreased hostile attributions and decreased aggressive responding toward the source of the rejection. Findings are interpreted as evidence for the buffering effect of cognitive representations of social category <b>group</b> <b>memberships</b> on the experience of rejection.

25|$|These {{findings}} can {{be explained}} in terms of self-categorization and empathy. From the perspective of self-categorization theory, a person’s own social identity, well-being is tied to their <b>group</b> <b>membership</b> so that when a group based identity is salient, the suffering of one group member can be considered to directly affect the group. Because of this shared identity, referred to as self-other merging, bystanders are able to empathize, which has been found to predict helping behaviour. For example, in a study relating to helping after eviction both social identification and empathy were found to predict helping. However, when social identification was controlled for, empathy no longer predicted helping behaviour.|$|E
25|$|Altruism {{research}} suggests that helping behaviour is more likely when there are similarities between the helper and the person being helped.

The aim of the present research was to examine the role of psychological symptoms and social <b>group</b> <b>memberships</b> in reducing the development of post-traumatic stress symptoms after orthopaedic injuries (OIs) and acquired brain injuries (ABIs).

40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that multiple <b>group</b> <b>memberships</b> can {{be a source of}} resilience in the face of various life challenges (e. g., illness, injury, life transitions, performance demands). In two studies the authors examined whether multiple <b>group</b> <b>memberships</b> promote resilience in the face of novel physical challenges. They found that belonging to multiple groups was associated with faster heart rate recovery for novice bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton athletes (Study 1) and that the salience of a greater number of <b>group</b> <b>memberships</b> led to greater endurance on a cold-pressor task (Study 2). Importantly, these effects were unchanged when controlling for individual differences in responses to the challenge, challenge perceptions, and group mem-bership importance.

25|$|Identity synergy principle: The {{fact that}} the {{personal}} and social selves can be activated independently {{raises the possibility that}} they may combine synergistically to motivate pro-group behavior. Consistent with this possibility, {{studies have shown that the}} activation of either the personal self or social self amplifies the willingness of strongly fused persons to behave in a pro-group fashion. For example, activating the personal self by ostracizing participants from the group based on their personal preferences, or activating the social self by ostracizing participants based on their <b>group</b> <b>membership,</b> resulted in the amplification of endorsement of pro-group action for strongly, but not weakly, fused individuals. Thus, unlike social identity theory which assumes that the personal self does not play a role in pro-group behavior, fusion theory holds that pro-group behaviors are motivated by both the personal and social selves and these two types of self-knowledge may sometimes work together.|$|E
