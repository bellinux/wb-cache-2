However the final version features just Norwood. Speaking on how the song came about Norwood said, [...] "Well, he had the song {{for a while and}} when I heard it, it really <b>just</b> <b>spoke</b> to me. Sometimes you get to a point in your life where you’re scared to be great, you’re scared to be beautiful, you’re scared to be the best version of you and you talk to yourself and you try to get yourself back on track. I just remember feeling like that at a point in my life. I know {{there are so many people}} out there that go through that dark time and I felt like it could speak to a lot of people." ...|$|E

2500|$|Alexander Sergeevich Pushkin {{was born}} in Moscow on May 26, 1799. He had African ancestry as his {{maternal}} great grandfather, from Abyssinia, was the adopted grandson and personal secretary to Peter the Great. Pushkin was raised by his tutors, house maids, and nanny, Arina Rodionovna, as his parents neglected him. In his teenage years, he lived in Lycèe of Tsarkoe Selo outside of St. Petersburg, which was later renamed Pushkin in his honor. [...] There he associated {{with a group of}} radicals, including the central figures in the Decembrist uprising, and wrote several controversial poems, leading to his exile in 1820 to the south of Russia. After several relocations, Pushkin’s exile was ended in 1826 by Tsar Nicholas I, who took on the role of Pushkin’s personal censor. After his initial meeting with Pushkin, Tsar Nicholas told the deputy minister of education that he had <b>just</b> <b>spoke</b> with “the cleverest man in Russia.” It is said that Pushkin created this work, a veiled critique of the state that could also be interpreted as supportive, to subvert the censorship imposed on him and show his support for the Decembrist Revolution. Pushkin is widely heralded as the greatest poet in Russian history. Over his short life, Pushkin wrote over 800 poems including a dozen longer narratives.His poetry is marked by his ability to create rhyme and rhythm from everyday speech, most commonly employing iambic tetrameter. Pushkin uses a variety of tones in his work, but is perhaps most remembered for his satirical humor and sociological criticism.In his final four years, Pushkin shifted his focus from poetry to prose. His historical novel The Captain’s Daughter was his final masterpiece. Regardless of genre, Pushkin’s linguistic genius is obvious and his influence on Russian writers is unparalleled.|$|E
