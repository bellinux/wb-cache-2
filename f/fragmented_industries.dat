40|$|In {{the present}} paper the {{following}} hypotheses have been tested: 1. pressure groups have a marginal role in <b>fragmented</b> <b>industries.</b> In fact, <b>fragmented</b> <b>industries</b> are characterised {{by the presence of}} many small firms and by self-centred entrepreneurs, prone more to conflicting than to co-operative behaviours; 2. regulatory interventions in <b>fragmented</b> <b>industries</b> have a strong impact on industry's structure by selecting the enterprises and modifying their strategic and structural profile; 3. the single firms are particularly vulnerable to regulatory interventions in <b>fragmented</b> <b>industries</b> as they can impose fundamental changes that {{they may not be able}} to face. The above hypotheses have been tested in the context of the tannery industry, a fragmented industry with about 2, 500 enterprises and more than 25, 000 employees. Specifically, the analysis has concentrated on evaluating the impact of the "Legge Merli" no. 319 of 10 / 05 / 1976 and subsequent alterations on the structure of the tannery industry and the behaviour of the single firms. This is a law which had great momentum in shaping the tannery industry as it fundamentally changed the economics of the firms and severely altered competition both among Italian tanneries and vis- 0 -vis foreign ones. The research methodology includes both qualitative and quantitative instruments. On the quantitative side, a longitudinal series of balance sheets of 191 firms have been analysed for the period 1986 - 1991, together with industry's secondary data. On the qualitative side, the research has focused on the analysis of published sources, interviews with entrepreneurs and other industry-experts (about 30 interviews were performed) ...|$|E

40|$|Extant {{empirical}} evidence has documented both a temporal {{variation in the}} number of initial public offerings (IPOs) and an industry clustering effect in these offerings. This article attempts to provide insights into this phenomenon by: (i) identifying industry conditions that influence IPO clustering, (ii) analyzing differences in characteristics of clustered versus non-clustered IPOs, and (iii) studying the impact of IPO clustering on long-run operating performance. We find that IPO clustering is more likely to occur in high-growth <b>fragmented</b> <b>industries</b> that are characterized by strong investment opportunities, favorable investor sentiment, and which require high levels of investments in R&D. Further, we document a negative relation between post-IPO operating performance and whether the IPO firm goes public in its industry cluster period. We conclude that the relatively poor post-IPO operating performance of firms that go public in industry cluster periods likely reflects industry overinvestment arising from too many firms within that industry chasing the same investment opportunities.

However, it is not too soon to start trying to understand the ways in which industry structure might change by looking at what the electronic marketplaces are trying to do. In particular, we are concerned with three theoretically motivated issues: 1) how well Asian marketplaces match theoretical characteristics believed likely to lead to changes in industry structure, 2) the electronic marketplaces ’ avowed strategic intents, and 3) their resources for success. 1...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{stochastic}} dynamic games with many players; {{these are a}} fundamental model {{for a wide range}} of economic applications. The standard solution concept for such games is Markov perfect equilibrium (MPE), but it is well known that MPE computation becomes intractable as the number of players increases. We instead consider the notion of stationary equilibrium (SE), where players optimize assuming the empirical distribution of others ’ states remains constant at its long run average. We make two main contributions. First, we provide a rigorous justification for using SE. In particular, we provide a parsimonious collection of exogenous conditions over model primitives that guarantee existence of SE, and ensure that an appropriate approximation property to MPE holds, in a general model with possibly unbounded state spaces. Second, we draw a significant connection between the validity of SE, and market structure: under the same conditions that imply SE exist and approximates MPE well, the market becomes fragmented in the limit of many firms. To illustrate this connection, we study in detail a series of dynamic oligopoly examples. These examples show that our conditions enforce a form of “decreasing returns to larger states”; this yields <b>fragmented</b> <b>industries</b> in the limit. By contrast, violation of these conditions suggests “increasing returns to larger states ” and potential market concentration...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} half-century we have {{observed}} dramatic growth in international trade, but equally dramatic changes {{have occurred in the}} nature of the world trade. Among recent trends in the world trade is the process of fragmentation characterized by geographical dispersion of the production activity. Such an environment creates a strong need for efficient coordination mechanisms connecting separate blocks of the fragmented production process where transportation is one of such mechanisms. This thesis focuses on transport sector and more specifically, maritime transport. The objective is to provide a theoretical framework aimed at determining how changes brought about by fragmentation affect shipping firms that serve transport needs of the <b>fragmented</b> <b>industries.</b> The problem is approached by identifying the key variables in the profit function of the shipping firm and describing central relationships between them. The first part presents the phenomenon of fragmentation in order to provide an overview over changing patterns of institutional organization and structural shifts {{in the nature of the}} world economic order. Then, requirements to transportation systems stemming from the needs of the fragmented chains of production are defined. The second part is devoted to transport economics.

40|$|This article {{studies the}} {{determinants}} {{of the success of}} industry consolidations using a unique sample of firms established {{at the time of their}} initial public offering: roll-up IPOs. In these transactions, small, private firms merge into a shell company, which goes public at the same time. These firms deliver poor stock returns; their operating performance mimics that of comparable firms but does not justify their high initial valuations. However, if the managers and owners of the firms included in the transaction remain involved in the business as shareholders and directors, operating and stock price performance improve, and future acquisitions are better received by the market. Higher ownership by the sponsor of the transaction leads to a reduction in performance, consistent with the view that the sponsor’s compensation is excessive. These findings highlight the impact of corporate governance on performance.

40|$|The {{dramatic}} {{growth in}} South Africa’s private equity and leveraged buyout market {{in recent years}} underlines the increased significance of the asset class and its importance in the asset allocation decision. This growth has equally been accompanied {{by the emergence of}} write-offs and unrealized investments carried at cost by private equity funds, eroding returns and generated value. This phenomenon mounts pressure on private equity practitioners to formulate and evolve better exit strategies {{in the face of an}} unfavourable exit climate compounded by dwindling arbitrage opportunities. This study therefore seeks to explore and establish the determinants of exit mode in the private equity industry thereby driving the evolution of exit strategy formulation and also contributing to the limited understanding of decision making in the industry. The study employs a mixed methods approach or methodological triangulation to provide empirical evidence supported by qualitative findings to achieve the objectives of identifying factors which predict or impact on the choice of exit mode for leveraged buyouts. Using a sample of 46 exited investments in the South African private equity industry, the study used various statistical techniques namely; descriptive analysis, independent samples t-tests, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), trinomial logistic regression modelling and robustness tests to identify the explanatory factors of exit mode for leveraged buyouts. The study found empirical evidence that the portfolio company’s operating performance and size (total investment) can significantly distinguish between choice of initial public offering (IPO) and secondary buyout as exit modes. The other determinants or predictors of exit mode; investment holding period and industry concentration were found not to have a significant contribution to the choice of exit mode via the quantitative analysis. Elite interviews were conducted with private equity experts selected through a purposive sampling technique. The findings of the qualitative analysis confirmed and supported the empirical findings pertaining to the predictive abilities firm size and operating performance in the choice of exit mode. Respondents to the study confirmed iii that investment holding period plays a diminished role as a predictor of exit mode owing to timing, macro-economic factors and the experience of the private equity manager all playing a either a direct, a mediating or moderating role in the choice of exit mode. In the South African context, respondents supported the consolidation hypothesis and justified that South African companies’ acquisition strategies are driven by the need to consolidate locally in order to gain access to new markets and improve the parent company’s market share. Therefore, portfolio companies in highly <b>fragmented</b> <b>industries</b> are ideal targets for strategic buyers and as such are likely to be exited via trade sales. This study also revealed that the choice of exit mode has no bearing on the ex-post realized exit multiple. The key findings of this study can be surmised as follows; the portfolio company’s operating performance and size are significant predictors of choice of exit mode. Investee companies in highly <b>fragmented</b> <b>industries</b> are likely to be exited via trade sales to strategic acquirers. Despite these findings, a fund manager’s competitive position to originate superior deal flow as well as negotiate higher exit multiples is greatly enhanced by the manager’s industry experience and his/her professional network in the financial/investor community. Other factors such as the robustness of the mergers and acquisitions markets, pressure from fundraising activities and existence of multiple arbitrage opportunities are also potential key drivers of exit strategy...|$|E
40|$|In many countries, {{construction}} industry contributes as ignificant {{part of their}} economy. Construction industry {{is one of the}} most complicated and <b>fragmented</b> <b>industries.</b> It is very unique industry and facing many problems such as low productivity, insufficient quality, poor safety, time over-runs, cost over-run and others. In order to address these long term problems various tools and methodologies have been developed. One of the successful approaches adopted to address these problems is lean construction. Lean construction is a new way to manage construction projects that makes significant improvements on complex, uncertain and quick projects. Lean Construction was proposed from Lean philosophies and theories that have offered lots of benefits to the manufacturing industry. It was founded by Toyota Motor Company in 1950 ’s to reduce manufacturing lead times, eliminate non-value adding activities, and reduce variability. These goals were obtained by methods such as pull scheduling, simplified operations, and buffer reduction. Lean is about doing more with less time, inventory, space, labour, and money. Lean production is a systematic elimination of waste (i. e. overproduction, waiting, transportation, inventory, and over-processing, defective units) and the implementation of continuous flow and customer pull. There are five issues that drive lean construction including cost, quality, delivery, safety, and morale. The first introduction of “Lean Construction” was in the year 1992 and was introduced by the Finnish scientist, Lauri Koskela. In his technical report “Application of the new production philosophy to construction”, he described the applicability of lean philosophy in {{construction industry}}.

40|$|This {{research}} compares knowledge {{integration in}} competitive and collaborative construction {{projects in the}} UK. It begins {{with the assumption that}} the most valuable commodity transferred along project supply chains is knowledge. It has been suggested that collaborative working methods (such as partnering) may represent a significant improvement in the way project knowledge can be captured and integrated. However, most academic work on knowledge management has concentrated on its integration within rather than between organizations: the topic is more difficult to address in multi-firm, project-based, and economically <b>fragmented</b> <b>industries</b> (such as construction). The present study focuses upon collaborative working as a vehicle for knowledge integration along the project supply chain. A review of the literature examines how recent approaches to construction organisation have sought to improve performance: these approaches all draw attention to such critical attributes as trust, commitment and relationships, all of which are difficult to measure. In this research, a social network analysis approach has been adopted to do this. This is the first time the technique has been put fully to this use in the context of construction projects. Software has been used to help visualize and compare knowledge networks in five projects (representing competitive and collaborative working) and this has provided data for comparison of different working patterns under different procurement systems. The working patterns and knowledge transactions in the two different procurement systems were shown to be different, and there were clear associations between the degree of collaborative working and the nature of social networks encountered. The technique has overcome previous difficulties in measuring certain attributes of collaborative working; has provided a way of benchmarking the differences in the way that competitive and collaborative working facilitate project knowledge integration; and represents a useful and novel way of analysing organizational behaviour in projects. It has explained why and how partnering and collaborative working can bring certain advantages...|$|E
