500|$|In {{defining}} {{his method}} for creating Tron: Legacy, Kosinski declared that his main {{objective was to}} [...] "make it feel real", adding that he wanted the audience to feel like filming actually occurred in the fictional universe. For this, many physical sets were built, as Kosinski [...] "wanted the materials to be real materials: glass, concrete, steel, so it <b>had</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> visceral quality." [...] Kosinski collaborated with people who specialized in fields outside of the film industry, such as architecture and automotive design. The looks for the Grid aimed for a more advanced version of the cyberspace visited by Flynn in Tron, which Lisberger described as [...] "a virtual Galapagos, which has evolved on its own". As Bailey put, the Grid would not have any influence from the internet as it had turned offline {{from the real world}} in the 1980s, and [...] "grew on its own server into something powerful and unique". Kosinski added that as the simulation became more realistic, it would try to become closer to the real world with environmental effects such as rain and wind, and production designer Darren Gilford stated {{that there would be a}} juxtaposition between the variety of texture and color of the real world introduction in contrast with the [...] "clean surfaces and lines" [...] of the Grid. As the design team considered the lights a major part of the Tron look, particularly for being set in a dark world—described by effects art director Ben Procter as [...] "dark silhouetted objects dipped in an atmosphere with clouds in-between, in a kind of Japanese landscape painting" [...] where [...] "the self-lighting of the objects is the main light source"—lighting was spread through every prop on the set, including the floor in Flynn's hideout. Lisberger also stated that while the original Tron [...] "reflected the way cyberspace was", the sequel was [...] "going to be like a modern day, like contemporary plus, in terms of how much resolution, the texturing, the feel, the style", adding that [...] "it doesn’t have that Pong Land vibe to it anymore." ...|$|E

60|$|Frequently, in Australia, one has cloud-effects of an {{unfamiliar}} sort. We <b>had</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> scenery, finely staged, {{all the way}} to Ballarat. Consequently we saw more sky than country on that journey. At one time a great stretch of the vault was densely flecked with wee ragged-edged flakes of painfully white cloud-stuff, all of one shape and size, and equidistant apart, with narrow cracks of adorable blue showing between. The whole was suggestive of a hurricane of snow-flakes drifting across the skies. By and by these flakes fused themselves together in interminable lines, with shady faint hollows between the lines, the long satin-surfaced rollers following each other in simulated movement, and enchantingly counterfeiting the majestic march of a flowing sea. Later, the sea solidified itself; then gradually broke up its mass into innumerable lofty white pillars of about one size, and ranged these across the firmament, in receding and fading perspective, in the similitude of a stupendous colonnade--a mirage without a doubt flung from the far Gates of the Hereafter.|$|E
