A further goal refers to examining if and how country-specific context variables (e.g. history, political system) affect <b>election</b> <b>campaign</b> communication. In comparative <b>election</b> <b>campaign</b> communication research the objective is to analyze whether different countries share common practices with regard to the organization of campaign or the news coverage of elections.|$|R

40|$|Political {{knowledge}} {{is crucial for}} the functioning of democracy: only informed citizens can cast a substantiated vote. Therefore, {{it is especially important}} that citizens are informed during <b>election</b> <b>campaigns.</b> Indeed, <b>election</b> <b>campaigns</b> can educate the public on the various parties and candidates. However, extant research mostly focuses on national <b>election</b> <b>campaigns.</b> Local <b>election</b> <b>campaigns</b> often get less (media) attention, yet have been seldom researched. In this paper we investigate whether citizens also learn during local <b>election</b> <b>campaigns.</b> We use panel data collected during the 2012 Antwerp local <b>election</b> <b>campaign.</b> We find that although the campaign did cause slight knowledge gains, it mainly increased the existing knowledge gap between well- and ill-informed citizens. On the other hand the campaign did amend some other gaps: uncertain voters learned more, and voters learned most about parties they evaluated highly...|$|R
