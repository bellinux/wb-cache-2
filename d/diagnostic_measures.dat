[...] Antiepileptic drugs do not prevent the development of PTE after head injury, but may be used to treat the condition if it does occur. [...] When medication does not work to control the seizures, surgery may be needed. Modern surgical techniques for PTE have their roots in the 19thcentury, but trepanation (cutting a hole in the skull) may have been used for the condition in ancient cultures.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to compare three subject didactic {{measuring}} instruments (the SOM, LEMOSS(II) and LCH questionnaires) with regard to validity. These questionnaires are <b>diagnostic</b> <b>measuring</b> instruments, which teachers can use as an aid in certain didactic situations within the classroom. This includes the specialist planning of a specific learning opportunity, and as point of departure for the discussion of a learner’s learning competency in order to master specific and critical outcomes. High Pearson correlations between the different fields of the three measuring instruments, as well as between the measuring instruments as a whole, were found for grade nine learners in the Tzaneen and Phalaborwa areas. None of the questionnaires can be used as autonomous predictors of respective subject marks. However, the SOM, LEMOSS(II) and LCH questionnaires are <b>diagnostic</b> <b>measuring</b> instruments and therefore it is not of such critical importance for these questionnaires to be extremely accurate predictors of subject marks. </p...|$|R
