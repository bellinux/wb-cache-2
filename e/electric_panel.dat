50|$|A {{distribution}} board (also known as panelboard, breaker panel, or <b>electric</b> <b>panel)</b> is {{a component of}} an electricity supply system that divides an electrical power feed into subsidiary circuits, while providing a protective fuse or circuit breaker for each circuit in a common enclosure.

40|$|Abstract – In {{an earlier}} paper {{by the authors}} [1], {{downscaled}} devices for microparts handling utilizing an ac electric field boundary wave were proposed. Devices that instantly generate contactless microparts driving forces through electric field creation have been designed and fabricated. In a further attempt, the mechanisms behind microparts conveyance are here subsequently validated in experiments and simulations. Particles as micropart substitute are actuated. On a thin protecting insulation-film above a series of encased and insulated parallel field electrodes, particles become either triboelectrically or induction charged {{through the application of}} balanced multi-phase voltages. The created non-uniform traveling field-wave conveys the charged particles perpendicular to the electrodes confined in potential wells from electrode to electrode. A series of particle materials with diameters up to 400 µm has been examined; metal, glass, and plastic spheres showed the best performances. Simulations of the potential distribution underline the experimental findings on the <b>electric</b> <b>panel</b> and dots device. One further result, which could have been shown by experiments, is the preoscillation of a moving particle caused by gravity. I...|$|E

Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing engineers, {{better known as}} MEPs, comprise {{a large number of}} employees who design and assist in the building of commercial structures.

This senior project transforms these structural plans into an architectural model and creates a power distribution system for the entire building.

40|$|Circuit breakers, {{disconnectors}}, fuse disconnectors and fuse holders {{installed in}} LV <b>electric</b> <b>panels</b> sometimes suffer overheating, mainly due to inadequate dissipation {{of the heat}} generated. A theoretical and experimental investigation is attempted of the mechanisms that can affect heat transfer to a component-conductor system, as well the mass and the external surface area of the component. The resulting system of differential equations is solved using the Laplace transform in the s-plane. The time-dependent temperature distribution in the component-conductor system is provided by an analytical expression, and a simple formula is given for the component's stabilised temperature. Results from the models are compared with experimental measurements performed on a fuse holder and are shown to be consistent. The model accuracy is also investigated. It is convincingly shown that excessive (or additional) external surface area of the component's metallic parts reduces the component temperature. Above a certain level, this can make the component act as a cooler of the conductor. In addition, an increase of the component's mass slows temperature stabilisation. The proposed model could effectively support component design as it involves all the technical characteristics of the system, so that the requirements of international standards are fulfilled {{in relation to the}} prevention of overheating. © IEE, 2005...|$|R

The solid (a glass-like material) is heated from above by two radiant <b>electric</b> <b>panels</b> and it is placed on a chilled plate held at near ambient, constant and uniform temperature. The transient temperature distribution over the semi-infinite solid surface is monitored by infrared thermography.

Droplet sizes in the range of 10 to 50 μl are used with initial solid surface temperatures between 90 and 180 ̊C. The results are compared with similar experiments performed with the semi-infinite solid heated from below by conduction to gain insight into the competing mechanisms of evaporation by direct radiation from above and by conduction at the solid-liquid interface. The droplet aspect ratio is a dominant parameter in the conduction controlled evaporative component. Therefore, particular care is taken in assessing the behavior of the droplet shape during the transient. The direct radiation from above strongly reduces the surface tension of the liquid and thus allows the drop to spread on the surface more than for the conduction case...|$|R
