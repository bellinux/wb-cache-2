40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} identification, the determinacy and the {{stability}} of ad hoc, "quasi-optimal" and optimal policy rules augmented with <b>financial</b> stability <b>indicators</b> (such as asset prices deviations from their fundamental values) and minimizing the volatility of the policy interest rates, when the central bank precommits to financial stability. Firstly, ad hoc and quasi-optimal rules parameters of <b>financial</b> stability <b>indicators</b> cannot be identified. For those rules, non zero policy rule parameters of <b>financial</b> stability <b>indicators</b> are observationally equivalent to rule parameters set to zero in another rule, {{so that they are}} unable to inform monetary policy. Secondly, under controllability conditions, optimal policy rules parameters of <b>financial</b> stability <b>indicators</b> can all be identified, along with a bounded solution stabilizing an unstable economy as in Woodford (2003), with determinacy of the initial conditions of non- predetermined variables. ...|$|R

A quarterly external <b>financial</b> <b>indicator</b> for several EMEs is built using bond-level data on spreads of corporate bonds issued in foreign capital markets, and its relationship with economic activity is examined. Results show that the indicator has considerable predictive power on future economic activity. Furthermore, an identified adverse shock to the <b>financial</b> <b>indicator</b> generates a large and protracted fall in real output growth, and about a third of its forecast error variance is associated with this shock. These findings are robust to controlling for possible spillovers from sovereign to corporate risk, among other considerations...|$|R

This paper {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between <b>financial</b> stress <b>indicator</b> variables and monetary policy in South Africa with emphasis on how robust these variables {{are related to the}} monetary policy interest rate. The <b>financial</b> stress <b>indicator</b> variables comprise a set of variables from the main segments of the South African financial market that include the bond and equity securities markets, the commodity market and the exchange rate market. The empirical results show that the set of <b>financial</b> stress <b>indicator</b> variables from the bond and equity securities markets as well as those from credit markets and property markets are robustly associated with the monetary policy interest rate, while the set of <b>financial</b> stress <b>indicator</b> variables from commodity markets and the exchange rate market are weakly associated with the monetary policy interest rate.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{following}} two issues. First, the paper investigates {{the extent to which}} financial development has contributed to economic growth in China. For this purpose, we utilize well-known <b>financial</b> development <b>indicators</b> and seek to find a long-run relationship between output growth and financial development. Second, the effects of financial repression on economic growth are examined. A financial repression index is constructed based on three related measures, and this index is augmented to the growth-finance equation. Empirical results show that, three <b>financial</b> development <b>indicators,</b> Liquid Liabilities, Domestic Credit and Non-Policy Loan, have stable positive long-run relationships with output growth. It is also found that output growth is weakly exogenous with respect to financial development, whereas financial development is not with respect to output growth. As for the financial repression, it turns out to have affected output growth negatively during the sample period. Unlike <b>financial</b> development <b>indicators,</b> <b>financial</b> repression index is found to be weakly exogenous...|$|R

40|$|Business failure {{has been}} one of the most {{investigated}} topics in the finance and the strategic literature during the last seven decades. However, most of this literature has been heavily focused on business failure prediction (with a clear focus on short-term prediction) and, simultaneously, only a few studies have investigated business failure prevention, focusing on understanding how a company may fail through "failure paths" and on the identification of very early warning financial and non-financial signals and symptoms. This may be explained by a conceptual difficulty to exactly represent what business failure prevention may mean and by a practical difficulty to build a <b>financial</b> <b>indicator</b> really allowing to announce a bankruptcy at least three years or more in advance, giving then time to potential corporate recovery. With this paper, we then propose an investigation of this concept of "Business Failure Prevention" and we test on a sample of 6 250 Belgian SMEs the ability of a specific <b>financial</b> <b>indicator</b> (referred as "Economic Added Result" and based on the amount of accounting value added which remains within a company when it has paid for its internal and external production factors) to effectively predict a business failure at least three years before it happens.

The result suggests that inflation and <b>financial</b> development <b>indicators</b> are cointegrated.
