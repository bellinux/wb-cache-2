5|$|Bart {{wakes up}} from the {{nightmare}} to find his family beside his bed. Marge assures him <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> be afraid of, but a green fog seeps {{in through the window}} and the Simpsons are turned inside out. They, along with Willie, perform a musical number over the end credits, but Bart is dragged away and eviscerated by Santa's Little Helper.|$|E
5|$|Brian and Stewie {{visit the}} local Quahog bank so that Brian can deposit holiday {{money in his}} safe deposit box. Stewie then {{wants to go to}} a store to return a $3,000 Thom Browne sweater. While they are still inside the vault, the door closes {{at the end of the}} work day and locks them inside until the next morning. Frightened, Stewie soils his diaper. Worried he will get a rash from the dirty diaper, Stewie desperately tries to make Brian eat his feces by {{threatening}} him with a gun that Brian had stored in his deposit box. They discover that Stewie has a cellphone in his pocket, but there's only enough charge in the battery for one short phone call. Unfortunately, Stewie uses the last of the phone's battery charge to call the clothing store rather than for help. Enraged, Brian hits Stewie, throws his phone on the ground (thus breaking the phone), and yells at Stewie, making him cry. Instantly remorseful and wanting to repair his relationship with Stewie, Brian reluctantly agrees to eat Stewie's feces in order to provide him with a clean diaper and make up for making Stewie cry. While watching Brian eating, Stewie becomes nauseated and throws up; Stewie then convinces Brian to eat his puke, correctly pointing out that Brian likes the taste of vomit. Realizing that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> clean his bottom with, Stewie manages to convince Brian to clean his bottom with his tongue in order to avoid infection, much to Stewie's pleasure. Afterward, they both decide to take a nap, but soon they realize that the next day is Sunday, meaning that they will have to wait another day before they can be released from the vault.|$|E
25|$|Returning to {{his home}} town of Caerleon (now a village in south Wales just outside Newport, where {{the ruins of the}} Roman {{fortress}} of Isca can still be seen, whose walls surrounding its Roman baths and elsewhere were still standing high during the medieval period). Sir Launfal takes humble lodgings, spends all the money that King Arthur gave him before setting out, and soon descends into poverty and debt. One Trinity Sunday, the king holds a banquet in Caerleon to which Sir Launfal, because of his poverty, is not invited. The mayor's daughter offers to let him spend the day with her, but he declines her offer since <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> wear. Instead, he borrows a horse from her and goes for a ride, stopping to rest under a tree in a nearby forest. Two maidens appear and bring him to a lady they call Tryamour, daughter of the King of Olyroun and of Fayrye, whom Sir Launfal finds lying on a bed in a glorious pavilion.|$|E

500|$|New Zealand Herald {{journalist}} Graham Reid similarly deems {{the track}} to be [...] "More interesting than exceptional", as {{an account of}} how Harrison [...] "soaked himself in booze and whatever" [...] {{in reaction to the}} disintegration of his marriage. Among other recent reviews, Scott Elingburg of PopMatters considers Dark Horse to be an album on which [...] "Harrison is playing music like <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> lose and all the world to gain", and he cites [...] "Simply Shady" [...] as one of two tracks that [...] "experiment subtly with tone, mood, and, most surprisingly, darkness". Classic Rock editor Paul Trynka highlights the song among the [...] "beautiful, small-scale moments" [...] that were overlooked {{at the time of the}} album's release, describing it as [...] "a shamefaced confessional on the banality of drunkenness".|$|E
500|$|Reviewing the 2014 Apple Years reissue, for Uncut magazine, Richard Williams dismisses Dark Horse as {{an album}} that [...] "only a devoted Apple Scruff could love", while Joe Marchese of The Second Disc {{describes}} it as [...] "Harrison's earthiest work to date", containing [...] "many stellar moments". Blogcritics' Chaz Lipp comments on the album's [...] "world-weariness" [...] yet similarly finds [...] "a lot of rewarding listening here", with [...] "Bye Bye, Love", [...] "Far East Man", [...] "It Is 'He'" [...] and [...] "Dark Horse" [...] among the highlights. Scott Elingburg of PopMatters opines: [...] "What makes Dark Horse so unique is that, aside from All Things Must Pass, Dark Horse sounds and feels like Harrison is playing music like <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> lose and {{all the world to}} gain." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{attempted}} to bring closure to {{several aspects of}} the series. In one sequence, Alex Krycek throws The Smoking Man {{down a flight of}} stairs, presumably to his death. Nicholas Lea, the actor who portrayed Krycek, noted: [...] "That's one of the character's great moments, when I get to push Bill Davis down a set of stairs. In a sense, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> lose because his life's burned out. So death doesn't have the same terror that it would to a young happy chap." [...] The episode also featured several tender moments between Mulder and Scully, which many fans found [...] "nearly pornographic {{in the context of their}} long, chaste courtship", according to Matt Hurwitz and Chris Knowles in their book The Complete X-Files. Gillian Anderson, however, defended the moments, arguing that there was ample amount of romance between Mulder and Scully prior to [...] "Requiem".|$|E

500|$|For {{the final}} {{number of the}} Thanksgiving Follies, Nellie {{performs}} a comedy burlesque dressed as a sailor singing the praises of [...] "his" [...] sweetheart ("Honey Bun"). Billis plays Honey Bun, dressed in a blond wig, grass skirt and coconut-shell bra. After the show, Emile asks Nellie to reconsider. She insists that she cannot {{feel the same way}} about him since she knows about his children's Polynesian mother. [...] Frustrated and uncomprehending, Emile asks Cable why he and Nellie have such prejudices. Cable, filled with self-loathing, replies that [...] "it's not something you're born with", yet it is an ingrained part of their upbringing ("You've Got to Be Carefully Taught"). He also vows that if he gets out of the war alive, he won't go home to the United States; everything he wants is on these islands. Emile imagines what might have been ("This Nearly Was Mine"). Dejected and feeling that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> lose, he agrees to join Cable on his dangerous mission.|$|E
500|$|The {{narrator of}} the song worries that the girl he is {{addressing}} will ignore him because <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> give her; likewise, the song's audience in the 1980syoung students and workerswere also suffering from not having resources to marry, {{to be with their}} girlfriends and boyfriends, or to attract members of the opposite sex. [...] The lyrics also express Western concepts of individualism, and were some of the first popular song lyrics in China to promote self-expression and self-empowerment. This put the song in stark contrast with older music, which had emphasized conformity and obedience. As the narrator, later on in the song, confidently proclaims to the girl that he will [...] "grab her hands" [...] ("") and then she will go with him (""), he suggests in the end that she can love {{the fact that he has}} nothing (""). On one level, this suggests that the song is about [...] "love conquering all", but the line has also been interpreted as threatening, and suggestive of an unorthodox and [...] "Dionysian" [...] mix of love and aggression.|$|E
500|$|With the film's success, it was {{immediately}} decided to finish Superman II. Ilya and Alexander Salkind and Pierre Spengler {{did not ask}} Donner to return because Donner had criticized them during the film's publicity phase. Donner commented in January 1979, [...] "I'd work with Spengler again, but only on my terms. As long as <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> say as the producer, and is just liaison between Alexander Salkind and his money, that's fine. If they don't want it on those terms, then {{they need to go}} out and find another director, it sure as shit ain't gonna be me." [...] Kidder, who portrayed Lois Lane, was dissatisfied by the producers' decision, and also criticized the Salkinds during publicity. As a result, Kidder was only given a cameo appearance for Superman III, and not a main supporting role. Jack O'Halloran, who portrayed Non, stated, [...] "It was great to work with Donner. Richard Lester was as big an asshole as the Salkinds." [...] Two more films, Superman III (1983) and [...] (1987), were produced. Superman Returns was released in 2006. Director Bryan Singer credited the 1978 Superman as an influence for Superman Returns, and used restored footage of Brando as Jor-El. [...] also was released in 2006.|$|E

500|$|In the Enchanted Forest, Rumpelstiltskin's (Carlyle) backstory is revealed. During the ogre wars, the {{children}} {{that live in the}} Frontlands are conscripted to military service at age 14. The Duke's men gather young soldiers with the help of [...] "The Dark One" [...] who possesses great magical power. Rumpelstiltskin's son, Baelfire (Dylan Schmid), will turn 14 in three days and he is desperate to keep his child out of battle. As father and son flee from the village, they are confronted by the Duke's men. They mock Rumpelstiltskin for running away when he was supposed to serve, and reveal that his cowardice caused his wife to leave him. Rumpelstiltskin begs for his son's life but <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> offer but fealty. The Duke's chief soldier commands Rumpelstiltskin to kiss his boot, but when the desperate man bends down the soldier kicks him to the ground. The old beggar (Brad Dourif) {{by the side of the}} road sees this and offers the pair assistance since they spared him a coin. The beggar tells Rumpelstiltskin a secret, the Duke possesses a dagger that allows him to command The Dark One and all his power. If Rumpelstiltskin steals the dagger, he will control The Dark One himself. If he kills The Dark One with the dagger, he will possess his magic. Rumpelstiltskin sets fire to the Duke's castle (in a parallel with Mr. Gold's actions) and steals the dagger which reads the name of The Dark One, [...] "Zoso".|$|E
500|$|Lord Brown concurred. [...] He {{said that}} [...] "the gains to {{be derived from}} denying [...] {{immunity}} from suit for breach of that duty substantially exceed whatever loss might be thought likely to result from this", since a potential liability would lead to a [...] "sharpened awareness of the risks of pitching their initial views of the merits of their client‚Äôs case too high or too inflexibly lest these views come to expose and embarrass them at a later date." [...] He thought that this was a [...] "healthy development". It would also ensure that a client who was caused loss by an expert witness acting in [...] "an egregious manner" [...] would receive a proper remedy; he said that such cases were likely to be [...] "highly exceptional". Lord Collins, agreeing, noted that the result did not affect the position of the expert vis-a-vis the opposing litigant, where there were [...] "wider considerations of policy" [...] against allowing claims. He also remarked that the existing ability to prosecute expert witnesses for perjury or to take disciplinary proceedings against them for unprofessional conduct in preparing or presenting their evidence did not fit with the claim that a liability to their clients for breach of duty would have a chilling effect on experts' willingness to give evidence. Lord Kerr, who also agreed with the decision, said that if [...] "an expert expresses an honestly held view, even if it differs from that which he may have originally expressed, provided it is an opinion which is tenable, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> fear from a disgruntled party." ...|$|E
500|$|HM Prison Maze was {{considered}} one of the most escape-proof prisons in Europe. In addition to [...] fences, each H-Block was encompassed by an [...] concrete wall topped with barbed wire, and all gates on the complex were made of solid steel and electronically operated. Prisoners had been planning the escape for several months. Bobby Storey and Gerry Kelly had started working as orderlies in H7, which allowed them to identify weaknesses in the security systems, and six handguns had been smuggled into the prison. Shortly after 2:30 pm on 25 September, prisoners seized control of H7 by simultaneously taking the prison officers hostage at gunpoint in order to prevent them from triggering an alarm. One officer was stabbed with a craft knife, and another was knocked down by a blow to the back of the head. One officer who attempted to prevent the escape was shot in the head by Gerry Kelly, but survived. By 2:50 pm the prisoners were in control of H7 without an alarm being raised. A dozen prisoners also took uniforms from the officers, and the officers were also forced to hand over their car keys and details of where their cars were, for possible later use during the escape. A rearguard was left behind to watch over hostages and keep the alarm from being raised until they believed the escapees were clear of the prison, when they returned to their cells. At 3:25 pm, a lorry delivering food supplies arrived at the entrance to H7, whereupon Brendan McFarlane and other prisoners took the occupants hostage at gunpoint and took them inside H7. The lorry driver was told the lorry was being used in the escape, and he was instructed what route to take and how to react if challenged. Storey told the driver, [...] "This man [...] is doing 30 years and he will shoot you without hesitation if he has to. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> lose." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "If we {{were going}} to libel him we would have done so, these issues have been considered.

The extent of his involvement is yet to be developed in evidence. It may be he has involvement in what occurred, but unless the Crown is able to adduce evidence that places him in the conspiracy, it is not appropriate to libel him as a co-conspirator." ...|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the course}} of 33 chapters, Brown depicts his {{experiences}} {{with each of the}} 23 prostitutes he has visited, giving each at least a chapter of her own. [...] He gives details of their physical features and sexual performances, while obscuring their faces and ethnicities and giving them false names. [...] He [...] "becomes an expert" [...] and goes into the details of the trade, learning how to solicit and tip, and what the abbreviations in johns' reviews at the Toronto escort review board mean.

2500|$|In Debrecen the city's mayor Lajos K√≥sa (Fidesz) {{was taking}} {{an active part}} of the demonstrations; he {{supported}} his party's plans to keep a rally in Budapest on Saturday (the rally had been cancelled since), and heavily criticized G√°bor Demszky, the mayor of Budapest for his perceived inactivity. ("It's possible G√°bor Demszky doesn't feel Budapest his own and he thinks that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> do when such things happen in the capital, but Debrecen is another city, it has a local government which cares for the city.") He also asked the demonstrators not to attack the MSZP's county headquarters in the city, stating that the building is Debrecen's property and the party is only renting it. (A similar thing happened in Miskolc where a speaker jokingly mentioned that [...] "we {{have the strength to}} break into the building, but we won't do it; that building will still be useful for something else.") ...|$|E
2500|$|Silas is {{described}} as [...] "sinister" [...] and [...] "scary". Rawle said that Silas is [...] "very interesting" [...] and complex. Hollyoaks series producer, Paul Marquess, called him mild-mannered and likened him to a bogeyman. Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy described Silas as a dual role of the affable older man and sinister killer. Rawle explained that Silas is [...] "old-fashioned" [...] and dislikes women who have loose morals. Silas actually appeared to enjoy killing people and although he mockingly apologised {{to some of his}} victims, he clearly didn't mean those apologies. There are only two known murders that he actually felt regret for; murdering his own daughter and killing India but these instances have not stopped him from killing people. The official Hollyoaks website said of Silas: [...] "Eep! Who knew that when Heidi‚Äôs cuddly dad Silas showed up in the village he {{would turn out to be}} the local serial killer with a penchant for strangulation?" [...] They also call him a [...] "killer grandad". Silas becomes more unstable and in October 2011, Rawle said [...] "He's a psychopath and he has slightly lost the plot now. He's very dangerous. He thinks he hasn't got a lot of time left to live and feels <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> lose." ...|$|E
