5|$|Following {{a report}} by George Ivatt in 1945, smoke <b>deflectors</b> were {{introduced}} due to drifting smoke obscuring the crew's forward vision. The first locomotive to be fitted with smoke <b>deflectors</b> from the outset was No. 6253 City of St. Albans in September 1946. All the following four locomotives included this feature. The first unstreamlined locomotive to be retrofitted was No. 6232 Duchess of Montrose in February 1945.|$|E
5|$|Viktor Pugachyov, {{piloting}} {{the second}} Su-27K, {{became the first}} Russian to conventionally land aboard an aircraft carrier on 1 November 1989. It {{was found that the}} carrier's jet blast <b>deflectors</b> were too close to the engine nozzles when raised at an angle of 60°; thus an improvised solution held the <b>deflectors</b> at 45°. However, when the aircraft was in front of it for longer than the maximum six seconds, the shield's water pipes exploded. The pilot, Pugachyov, reduced engine throttle, accidentally causing the detents (blocks used to restrain aircraft from accelerating) to retract and the fighter to move forwards. The aircraft was quickly stopped; Pugachyov later took off without the use of blast <b>deflectors</b> or detents. Since then, a Kamov Ka-27PS search-and-rescue helicopter was flown close to the carrier in case of an accident.|$|E
40|$|Torque {{generation}} and flow distribution of a lift-based vertical-axis turbine with an upstream deflecting plate are investigated in water tunnel experiments. The deployment of a <b>deflector</b> {{in front of}} a lift-based turbine is a promising approach to increase local flow velocity and enhance energy conversion efficiency without consideration for complicated control. For the turbine with the <b>deflector,</b> the phase during which the blade passes near {{the front end of the}} turbine has a major contribution to torque increase from the case without the <b>deflector.</b> Meanwhile, the <b>deflector</b> can have a negative effect in torque generation at the phase when the blade moves upstream against free stream if the turbine is placed close to the <b>deflector</b> in a crosswise direction. The change of nearby flow distribution by the <b>deflector</b> is also examined to find its correlation with torque generation. When the blade rotates through the near-wake region of the <b>deflector,</b> the blade can collides with the vortical structure shed from the <b>deflector.</b> This interaction causes significant torque fluctuation...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} an {{upstream}} flat <b>deflector</b> {{on the power}} output of two counter-rotating straight-bladed vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs) was investigated experimentally. Although many studies on the <b>deflector</b> effect have been done for a drag-based Savonius VAWT, there is little information {{on the performance of}} a lift-based VAWT with a <b>deflector.</b> If a flat vertical plate is normal to the free-stream wind direction, the local wind speed outside the near-wake region of the plate is larger than the free-stream velocity. Thus, when each of the counter-rotating turbines is positioned outside the near-wake region, its power output increases significantly. The power output increase with the <b>deflector</b> installed is dependent on the width and height of the <b>deflector</b> and the turbine position relative to the <b>deflector...</b>|$|R
40|$|In recent years, active {{research}} has been conducted to study the technological feasibility of supersonic laminar flow control on the wing of the High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT). For this study, the F- 16 XL has been chosen due to its highly swept crank wing planform that closely resembles the HSCT configurations. During flights, it is discovered that the shock wave generated from the aircraft inlet introduces disturbances on the wing where the data acquisition is conducted. The flow field about a supersonic inlet is characterized by a complex three dimensional pattern of shock waves generated by the geometrical configuration of a <b>deflector</b> and a cowl lip. Hence, in this study, experimental method is employed to investigate the effects of the variation of <b>deflector</b> configuration on the flow field, and consequently, the possibility of diverting the incoming shock-disturbances away from the test section. In the present experiments, a model composed of a simple circular tube with a triangular <b>deflector</b> is designed to study the <b>deflector</b> length and the <b>deflector</b> base width variation in the flow field. Experimental results indicate that the lowest external pressure ratio is observed at the junction where the <b>deflector</b> lip and the inlet cowl lip merge. Also, it is noted that the external pressure ratio, the internal pressure ratio, the coefficient of spillage drag, and the shock standoff distance decrease as the <b>deflector</b> length increases. In addition, the Redefined Total Pressure Recovery Ratio (RTPRR) increases with an increase in the <b>deflector</b> length. Results from the study of the effect of the <b>deflector's</b> base width variation on the flow field indicate that the lowest external pressure ratio is observed at the junction between the inlet cowl lip and the <b>deflector</b> lip. As the base width of the <b>deflector</b> increases, the external pressure ratio at 0 rotation increases, whereas the external pressure ratio at 180 rotation decreases. In addition, the internal pressure ratio and the coefficient of spillage drag decrease as the base width of the <b>deflector</b> increases. However, RTPRR and shock standoff distance increase as the base width increases. In conclusion, as <b>deflector</b> dimensions vary, distinctive patterns in the pressure variation around the inlet <b>deflector</b> are observed. With an increase in the <b>deflector</b> length and base width, the magnitude of shock-disturbances are weakened due to a decrease in the external pressure ratio. Also, as the <b>deflector</b> length and base width increase, a smaller bow shock angle is formed. Therefore, the inlet shock wave formation would be significantly altered, and consequently, shock disturbances on the wing test section can be avoided through appropriately designing the <b>deflector...</b>|$|R
5|$|All A3 Pacifics were {{subsequently}} {{fitted with a}} double Kylchap chimney to improve performance and economy.

5|$|The {{benefits}} {{gained by}} Maunsell's modifications {{showed in the}} improved performance of the first batch of Maunsell S15s over their Urie-built predecessors. A third batch was ordered in 1931, coinciding with a downturn in the volume of freight due to the economic depression. This meant that {{the last of the}} S15 class was not completed until 1936, although weight-saving modifications were undertaken to this batch. A final modification was also applied to the class at this time, when all locomotives were equipped with smoke <b>deflectors</b> to improve visibility from the footplate when travelling at speed. This modification was a feature that became common to most Maunsell-influenced designs.|$|E
5|$|The class {{performed}} well from the outset, {{but there were}} a number of minor modifications over the years. The first ten were built without smoke <b>deflectors,</b> but these were added from August 1931, and the remaining thirty were fitted with them from new. Following the successful introduction of the Lemaître multiple jet blastpipes on to the Lord Nelson class, Maunsell's successor Oliver Bulleid began to fit them to the Schools class. However no discernible improvement to draughting was experienced, and only twenty examples were so modified, the most obvious change in their appearance being the large diameter chimney.|$|E

When Flying Scotsman was due to be scrapped, Pegler stepped in and bought it outright, with the political support of Prime Minister Harold Wilson. He spent {{large amounts of money}} {{over the next few years}} having the locomotive restored at Doncaster Works as closely as possible to its LNER condition: the smoke <b>deflectors</b> were removed; the double chimney was replaced by a single chimney; and the tender was replaced by one of the corridor type with which the locomotive had run between 1928 and 1936. It was also repainted in LNER livery.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to show the effect of single <b>deflector</b> plate on the performance of combined Darrieus-Savonius water turbine. In order to overcome the disadvantages of low torque of solo Darrieus turbine, a plate <b>deflector</b> mounted in front of returning Savonius bucket of combined water turbine composing of Darrieus and Savonius rotor has been proposed in this study. Some configurations of combined turbines with two stage Savonius rotors were experimentally tested in a river of constant velocity 0. 8 m/s.

5|$|At {{the same}} time as the Fleet Air Arm was {{receiving}} its first aircraft, the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment had three FG.1s delivered to its 'C' Squadron for flight deck trials aboard Eagle. Two sets of trials were successfully carried out in March and June 1969; the first comprised approaches and touch and go landings, while the second set of trials involved full catapult launch and arrested recovery. As a result of the reheat from the Spey turbofans, the ship's jet blast <b>deflectors</b> (JBD) were not used; instead a steel plate was fixed to the deck to absorb the heat of the engines building to launch, and fire hoses were used after each launch to prevent them melting.|$|E
5|$|George Ivatt's 1945 {{report also}} {{recommended}} {{the removal of}} all streamlining casings and they {{were removed from the}} fitted locomotives from 1946 onwards. It had been found to be of little value at speeds below , and was unpopular with running shed employees as it caused difficulty of access for maintenance. The first step towards de-streamlining was carried out during the Second World War when many of the streamlined tenders had their side sheets cut away {{at the rear of the}} tender. Many photographs exist showing this measure. The removal of the streamlining proper commenced in April 1946 with No. 6235 City of Birmingham. All de-streamlining coincided with the fitting of smoke <b>deflectors.</b> No. 6243 City of Lancaster was renumbered as 46243 in April 1948 and as it was not de-streamlined until May 1949, when it became the only locomotive to carry its British Railways number while streamlined.|$|E
5|$|Partially {{because of}} the Crewkerne incident, and due to the incessant {{modification}} of Bulleid’s original design, British Railways took the decision to rebuild the entire class to a more conventional design by R. G. Jarvis, adopting many features from the BR 'Standard' locomotive classes that had been introduced since 1950. The air-smoothed casing was removed and replaced with conventional boiler cladding, and the chain-driven valve gear was replaced with three separate sets of Walschaerts valve gear. The rebuilds were provided with a completely revised cylindrical smokebox, a new Lord Nelson-type chimney and LMS-style smoke <b>deflectors.</b> Together {{with the lack of}} air-smoothed casing, these helped reduce the problem of smoke and steam obscuring the driver's vision of the line.|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{solutions}} are {{obtained for the}} cases of straight circular jets impinging on axisymmetric curved surfaces and plane jets impinging symmetrically on two-dimensional curved surfaces.

5|$|The {{class was}} heavily used by British Railways: 29 {{locomotives}} required replacement cylinders between 1955 and 1961 due to excessive wear. Frames were occasionally replaced due to stress caused by heavy use, and the steam circuit was revised when new cylinders were fitted: the inside steam pipes of Maunsell's original design {{were replaced by}} outside steam pipes emerging from the smokebox, behind the smoke <b>deflectors.</b> From 1957, some of the locomotives had larger-diameter BR Standard Class4 chimneys fitted to improve draughting with poor-quality coal, though the decline of steam on the Southern Region precluded use on the entire class. Crew reports maintained that the latter modifications cut fuel and water consumption. The final set of modifications constituted the fitting of new injectors and Automatic Warning System (AWS) equipment in 1957 and 1959 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} the {{original}} design was such that No. A866 was put {{on display at the}} British Empire Exhibition at Wembley from May to November 1925, and no class-wide modifications were made until 1934. This was when the SECR and Woolwich batches began to receive new domes and front footsteps during overhauls and general repairs. These were the same design as those used on Nos.14001414, and were intended to standardise components between the batches. The SECR and Woolwich batches also received smoke <b>deflectors</b> to prevent drifting smoke from obscuring the driver's vision ahead. The U1 chimneys replaced the standard Nclass type on the earlier locomotives, which, along with the removal of the piston tail rods on the earlier batches, created a truly standardised appearance.|$|E
5|$|The second {{batch of}} ten new-build U class {{locomotives}} was constructed between February and May 1931 when more obsolete locomotives were withdrawn from service.

The new batch also featured detail differences {{from the rest of the}} class, such as the arrangement of the footsteps at the front of the locomotive, though continued to use the standard left-hand drive cab layout to improve the driver’s forward vision from the cab. Smoke <b>deflectors</b> were fitted to the whole class from 1933 to prevent drifting smoke from obscuring forward vision.
