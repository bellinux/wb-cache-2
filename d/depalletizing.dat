Manual picking can be both man to goods, i.e. {{operator}} using a cart or conveyor belt, or {{goods to}} man, i.e. the operator benefiting from {{the presence of a}} mini-load ASRS, vertical or horizontal carousel or from an Automatic Vertical Storage System (AVSS). Automatic picking is done either with dispensers or <b>depalletizing</b> robots.|$|E

It unloads partial, mixed, or full pallets of loosely or tightly packed boxes - regardless {{of the number of}} layers and handles single, double and triple picks on the fly. It can move boxes from floor to conveyor, table to pallet, pallet to conveyor, truck to conveyor, or assembly line to staging area.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — <b>Depalletizing</b> is a {{challenging}} task for manip-ulation robots. Key to successful application {{are not only}} robustness of the approach, but also achievable cycle times {{in order to keep}} up with the rest of the process. In this paper, we propose a system for <b>depalletizing</b> and a complete pipeline for detecting and localizing objects as well as verifying that the found object does not deviate from the known object model, e. g., if it is not the object to pick. In order to achieve high robustness (e. g., with respect to different lighting conditions) and generality with respect to the objects to pick, our approach is based on multi-resolution surfel models. All components (both software and hardware) allow operation at high frame rates and, thus, allow for low cycle times. In experiments, we demonstrate <b>depalletizing</b> of automo-tive and other prefabricated parts with both high reliability (w. r. t. success rates) and efficiency (w. r. t. low cycle times).

40|$|Nowadays, one of {{the most}} common loading aid devices for any kind of goods is the pallet. It allows manual or {{automated}} handling of goods through the complete material flow process and enables easy exchange between the various process steps. Goods are not only shipped on pallets, but can also be stored on them efficiently. Thus, palletizing, <b>depalletizing,</b> and order assembly are ever-recurring tasks in all types of material flow systems - may these be in service sectors, distribution centres or warehouses, or for the immediate supply of production systems...|$|E
40|$|Robots offer a high {{potential}} for the enhancement {{of the performance of}} logistical processes like order picking, palletizing or <b>depalletizing.</b> However, present robot systems for logistical applications are often expensive solutions that have been developed under high engineering and customizing efforts in order to adapt the robot system to the specific requirements of enterprises. Through modular design and the definition of adequate interfaces as well as through innovative planning methods the profitability of such system can be increased tremendously. This is the main objective of the research project "Branchenunabhängige Basismodule für ein Kommissionierrobotersystem - KomRob", i. e. branch independent modules for order picking using industrial robots, which is lead by the Fraunhofer IPA and granted by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) ...|$|E
40|$|In this chapter, novel {{approaches}} {{for the detection}} of logistical objects (loading units) in the field of material flow applications are comparative presented, focusing on salut ions using low cast 3 D sensors. These approaches realize substantial changes in comparison to traditional system design of logistic processes. Complex 3 D-vision systems, costly laser scanners or throughput decreasing local sensor salut ions integrated in grippers are substituted by low cast Photonic Mixing Device (PMD) cameras or structured light sensors (like Asus Xtion or Microsoft Kinect). By using low cast sensors and modern point cloud processing algorithms for detection and classification in logistic applications like <b>depalletizing,</b> automation of usually manual processes will be economically feasible. Besides the description of different basic solution concepts for 2. 5 D and 3 D, two practical applications are presented. Combining measurements of the PMD sensor and a predetermined model of loading situations, stored during the assembly of the pallet, is the first practical application for contour checking in the automated <b>depalletizing</b> process. This approach can compensate for the drawbacks of the comparatively low resolution of the PMD camera. Thus, it is possible to detect the deviation between the nominal and the actual loading positions and-if necessary-an automated correction of the packaging scheme may be initiated. A 3 D scanning approach (with dynamic sensor positioning) to acquire a full, registered 3 D model of the pallet load is explained within the second example. An essential part of both approaches are computer-graphics methods specific to the given problem. As a trans-applicable function, (auto) calibration techniques for 2. 5 and 3 D sensor applications will be presented. From an economic point of view, these approaches could decrease the costs of automated facility logistic processes. Within the evaluation the critical requirements to reach this aim are discussed on the application layer...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} novel box <b>depalletizing</b> {{system based on}} images {{acquired}} {{with a time of}} flight laser sensor mounted on the hand of the robot. Scanning the upper layer of the pallet yields a 2. 5 D image to which edge detection and robust line fitting are applied to extract 3 D vertices. This vertex information is used as an input for a model based object recognition system. Model vertices are matched to scene vertices and object location hypothesis are formed. These hypotheses are verified or rejected using a two-step verification process. Due {{to the fact that we}} use edges to extract vertices, rather than surfaces, we are able to detect target objects, in both cluttered and ordered configurations. Our experiments with different configurations of card board boxes and paper tissue packets demonstrate the validity of our approach. The main advantages of our system are it’s versatility, simplicity, efficiency and robustness. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper studies a {{scheduling}} problem arising in a beef distribution system where pallets {{of various types}} of beef products in the warehouse are first depalletized and then individual cases are loaded via conveyors to the trucks which deliver beef products to various customers. Given each customer's demand {{for each type of}} beef, the problem is to find a <b>depalletizing</b> and truck loading schedule that fills all the demands at a minimum total cost. We first show that the general problem where there are multiple trucks and each truck covers multiple customers is strongly NP-hard. Then we propose polynomial-time algorithms for the case where there are multiple trucks, each covering only one customer, and the case where there is only one truck covering multiple customers. We also develop an optimal dynamic programming algorithm and a heuristic for solving the general problem. By comparing to the optimal solutions generated by the dynamic programming algorithm, the heuristic is shown to be c [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of ergonomic interventions involving a reduction of the mass (from 16 to 11 and 6 kg) {{and an increase in}} the initial lifting height (from pallet height to 90 cm above the ground) of building blocks in a mock-up of an industrial <b>depalletizing</b> task, investigating lifting behaviour as well as low back moments (calculated using a 3 -D linked segment model). Nine experienced construction workers participated in the experiment, in which they removed building blocks from a pallet in the way they normally did during their work. Most of the changes in lifting behaviour that were found would attenuate the effect of the investigated interventions on low back moments. When block mass was reduced from 16 to 6 kg, subjects chose to lift the building block from a 10 (SD 10) cm greater distance from the front edge of the pallet and with a 100 (SD 66) degrees/...|$|E
40|$|The {{description}} {{refers to}} a device for <b>depalletizing</b> and/or picking up pliable flat sack bundles not collected by auxiliary means. The device comprises a gripper unit and a mobile bottom-support part and a clamping cylinder to grip the parts to be raised. The gripper unit has a first holding-down clamp which is lowered onto the parts to be raised, and a second holding-down clamp which is placed form-fitting on the parts lying below. A contact gap is thus created for the bottom support element arranged in the second holding-down clamp and movable relative to the latter. The bottom support element leaves {{the area of the}} second holding-down clamp during the travel movement and supports the parts from below whereby it is in form-fitting contact with the lower parts during the entire travel movement. After the travel movement, a clamping cylinder is placed on the parts to be raised. It grips the parts together with the bottom support element...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{automation}} of kitting tasks—collecting a set {{of parts}} for one particular car into a kit—has a huge impact in the automotive industry. It considerably increases the automation levels of tasks typically conducted by human workers. Collecting the parts involves picking up objects from pallets and bins as well as placing them in the respective compartments of the kitting box. In this paper, we present a complete system for automated kitting with a mobile manipulator thereby focusing on <b>depalletizing</b> tasks and placing. In order to allow for low cycle times, we present particularly efficient solutions to object perception as well as motion planning and execution. For easy portability to different platforms, all components are integrated into a skill-based framework that is tightly coupled with a task planning component. We present results of experiments at both a research laboratory environment and at the industrial site of PSA Peugeot Citroën serving as a proof of concept for the overall system design and implementation.

40|$|Company XYZ {{is in the}} {{beverage}} industry producing, bottling, and distributing a variety of products. The starting point of the bottling process begins at the de-palletizing workstation where employees manually unload new cases of bottles from a pallet onto a conveyor. Workers at this station were complaining of discomfort in the shoulders/neck, elbows, hands, wrists, and lower back from excessive overhead reaching {{at the beginning of}} a new pallet and forward bending toward the end of the unloading process. The purpose of this study was to identify, via ergonomic assessment, if workstation design and work practice risk factors were exposing employees to injuries and illnesses at XYZ Company’s de-palletizing workstation. This ergonomic assessment was performed in three steps. First, the researcher began by identifying the extent of the 3 employees discomfort by utilizing work-related musculoskeletal disorder symptom surveys. These results indicated the severity and location of the employee’s distress and informed the researcher of the extent of the problem. In the second step, the researcher video-recorded an employee’s bodily postures while performing job duties at the <b>depalletizing</b> workstation. The body angles and posture measurements were incorporate...|$|E
40|$|The {{revisions}} of the lifting equation used by NIOSH {{in an effort to}} assist in the analysis and prevention of back injuries caused by manual lifting reflected new findings and provided methods for evaluating asymmetrical lifting tasks and lifts of objects with less than optimal couplings between the object and the hands of the person doing the lifting. The revised equation also provided guidelines for a more diverse range of lifting tasks than did the earlier equation. The equation was only one tool of several to be used in a comprehensive effort to prevent work related low back pain and disability. The equation was discussed through a definition of the terms used, the limitations of the lifting task, the various components of the equation (horizontal, vertical, distance, asymmetry, frequency, and coupling), and the lifting index. Procedures were described for analyzing lifting jobs. Several example problems were considered, including jobs performed a few times per shift such as loading punch press stock, loading supply rolls, and loading bags into a hopper; single tasks performed repetitively such as package inspection and dish washing machine unloading; repetitive multitasks of short duration including a <b>depalletizing</b> operation and handling cans of liquid; and repetitive multitasks of long duration such as product packaging and warehouse order filling. A reprint of an article on the revised NIOSH equation was included in an appendix. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 Introduction [...] 1. The Revised lifting equation [...] 2.
