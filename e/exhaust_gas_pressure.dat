The important features and requirements for an HSCT exhaust nozzle are shown for a 2 DCD (two-dimensional convergent-divergent) design. The same requirements {{would apply to}} an axisymmetric design. Exhaust nozzle weight has an adverse effect on the overall aircraft range, payload, and engine specific fuel consumption and is therefore the primary driver for advanced exhaust nozzle materials. Because of the large airflow and pressure gradients, exhaust nozzles are extremely large and heavy when made from current materials. The use of advanced materials with higher specific strength will reduce the weight of exhaust nozzle components. In addition to the flow of high-temperature <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> into the <b>exhaust</b> nozzle, ambient air is entrained to reduce gas exit velocities and suppress sound.

40|$|Proceedings of ASME Turbo Expo 2003 Power of Land, Sea, and Air June 16 - 19, 2003, Atlanta, Georgia, USAThe {{combined}} cycle power plant {{is made up}} of three major systems, the gas turbine engine, the heat recovery steam generator and the steam turbine. Of the major systems the gas turbine engine is a fixed design offered by a manufacturer, and the steam turbine is also a fairly standard design available from a manufacturer, but it may be somewhat customized for the project. In contrast, the heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) offers many different design options, and its design is highly customized and integrated with the steam turbine. The objective of this project is to parametrically investigate the design and cost of the HRSG system, and to demonstrate the impact on the overall cost of electricity (COE) of a {{combined cycle}} power plant. There are numerous design parameters that can affect the size and complexity of the HRSG, and it is the plan for the project to identify all the important parameters and to evaluate each. For this study, the design parameter chosen for evaluation is the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pressure</b> drop across the HRSG. This parameter affects the performance of both the gas turbine and steam turbine {{and the size of the}} heat recovery unit. Single-pressure, two-pressure and three-pressure HRSGs are all investigated, with the tradeoffs between design point size, performance and cost evaluated for each system. A genetic algorithm is used in the design optimization process to minimize the investment cost of the HSRG. Several system level metrics are employed to evaluate a design. They are gas turbine net power, steam turbine net power, fuel consumption of the power plant, net cycle efficiency of the power plant, HRSG investment cost, total investment cost of the power plant and the operating cost measured by the cost of electricity (COE). The impacts of HRSG <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pressure</b> drop and system complexity on these system level metrics are investigated...|$|E
40|$|Pressure wave {{compressor}} {{is one of}} {{the efficient}} compressors that can supercharge internal combustion engines. In this compressor, the intake air interacts directly with the exhaust gases in the rotor channels. Thus, the intake air is directly compressed by the exhaust gases, the role of the rotor is that of distribution of the exhaust gas and of the intake air. For a certain type of compressor, the value of the supercharging pressure varies with the value of <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pressure</b> and with the driving speed of the compressor. Currently, the pressure wave compressor is driven by the crankshaft.

40|$|The {{use of the}} {{three-way}} catalyst in motor vehicles has entailed a radical increase {{in the importance of}} misfire detection. In the case of a misfire, unburned fuel accesses the exhaust system, where its combustion in catalyst causes a dangerous increase of temperature, which may result in damage to the catalyst due to its thermal overload. Moreover, it may also lead to an increased emission of toxic substances. Therefore, misfire in an internal combustion engine must be detected, as specified in the On-Board Diagnostics II (OBDII) regulations beginning from 1996 model year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (E. P. A.). Misfire detection constitutes an essential ingredient of OBDII. Its implementation entails the use of sophisticated measurement methods and the processing of the measured signals. Misfires tend to be related to a faulty ignition system, (Defective ignition plugs, leaking secondary insulation, damaged ignition control module or high voltage wires). Yet there is still a wide spectrum of other possible causes of misfire, not connected with the spark generation circuit. Misfire may rise, for example; due to the leaky intake manifold, mechanisms damage to the engine, EGR system valve damage, inappropriate air-fuel ratio, Exhaust restrictions, damaged crankcase ventilation system (PVC), damaged injector, damaged intake or outlet valves or their improper control timing. If misfire occurs with such high frequency that the excessive quantity of unburned fuel accessing the catalyst threatens to damage it, the blinking malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) will make the driver aware of the extent of the damage of the engine. Many strategies of misfire detection have been developed, including variation in engine shaft angular speed, spark plug voltage, cylinder pressure, oxygen sensor signal, knowledge based expert system, and neural networks. WE propose a new method to use the real time signals of conventional oxygen sensor (EGO) and wide band oxygen sensor (UEGO) to detect misfire. In this paper, misfire was induced on purpose with a misfire generator. The sensors and the misfire trigger signals were recorded simultaneously. In this paper, we suggested a misfire detection method which used the fluctuation of an EGO and an UEGO sensors output signals caused by a misfire. The fluctuation in oxygen concentration in an exhaust manifold was estimated by recording the conventional oxygen sensor signal and the wide band oxygen sensor signal. It was found that the differentiated sensors’ signals give the criteria for misfire detection. The misfire can be detected by monitoring the amplitude of the fluctuation in the differentiated signals. The differentiated signals of UEGO and EGO sensors can be used for misfire detection in a single cylinder motorcycle engine at any operating conditions. The proposed misfire detection method had showed a reliability up to 98 % for UEGO and 90 % for EGO sensors at different engine operating conditions such as: engine speed from idle (2000 rpm) to 5000 rpm, engine loads 20 %TPS to 60 % TPS, and Air-fuel ratio varying from lean to rich.

According {{to the best}} of the author's knowledge, {{it is the first time}} that the {{influence}} of acetone blends has been studied in a gasoline-fueled engine. The blended fuels were tested for their energy efficiencies and pollutant emissions using SI (spark-ignition) engine with single-cylinder and 4 -stroke. Experimental results showed that the AC 3 (3 vol. % acetone[*]+[*] 97 vol. % gasoline) blended fuel has an advantage over the neat gasoline in <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> temperature, in-cylinder <b>pressure,</b> brake power, torque and volumetric efficiency by about 0. 8 %, 2. 3 %, 1. 3 %, 0. 45 % and 0. 9 %, respectively. As the acetone content increases in the blends, as the engine performance improved where the best performance obtained in this study at the blended fuel of AC 10. In particular, <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> temperature, in-cylinder <b>pressure,</b> brake power, torque and volumetric efficiency increase by about 5 %, 10. 5 %, 5. 2 %, 2. 1 % and 3. 2 %, respectively, compared to neat gasoline. In addition, the use of acetone with gasoline fuel reduces exhaust emissions averagely by about 43 % for carbon monoxide, 32 % for carbon dioxide and 33 % for the unburnt hydrocarbons. The enhanced engine performance and pollutant emissions are attributed to the higher oxygen content, slight leaning effect, lower knock tendency and high flame speeds of acetone, compared to the neat gasoline. Finally the mechanism of acetone combustion in gasoline-fueled engines is proposed in this work; two main pathways for acetone combustion are highlighted; furthermore, the CO, CO 2 and UHC (unburnt hydrocarbons) mechanisms of formation and oxidation are acknowledged. Such acetone mechanism is employed for further understanding acetone combustion in spark-ignition engines...|$|R

5000|$|Turbochargers suffer (to {{a greater}} or lesser extent) from {{so-called}} turbo-spool (turbo lag; more correctly, boost lag), in which initial acceleration from low RPM is limited by the lack of sufficient <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> mass flow (<b>pressure).</b> Once engine RPM is sufficient to raise the turbine RPM into its designed operating range, there is a rapid increase in power, as higher turbo boost causes more <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> production, which spins the turbo yet faster, leading to a belated [...] "surge" [...] of acceleration. This makes the maintenance of smoothly increasing RPM far harder with turbochargers than with engine-driven superchargers, which apply boost in direct proportion to the engine RPM. The main advantage of an engine with a mechanically driven supercharger is better throttle response, as well as the ability to reach full-boost pressure instantaneously. With the latest turbocharging technology and direct gasoline injection, throttle response on turbocharged cars is nearly as good as with mechanically powered superchargers, but the existing lag time is still considered a major drawback, especially considering {{that the vast majority of}} mechanically driven superchargers are now driven off clutched pulleys, much like an air compressor.|$|R

Under this assumption, the LPT was designed to recover the latent energy of discharged <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> at low <b>pressure</b> ratios (1. 05 - 1. 3) and to drive a small electric generator with a maximum power output of 1. 0 kW. The design speed was fixed at 50, 000 rpm with a pressure ratio, PR of 1. 1. Commercially available turbines are not suitable for this purpose due to the very low efficiencies experienced when operating in these pressure ratio ranges. A bespoke mean-line model was developed to evaluate the turbine performance and to generate a preliminary LPT design. Prior to the design work, the mean-line model was validated against an existing turbine. A good agreement between the predicted turbine performance and the test result was found and a minimum Relative Standard Deviation value of 1. 62...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of an {{examination}} of the behavior of soils subjected to rocket and jet <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases.</b> it was concluded that the <b>gas</b> <b>pressure</b> in the pores of the soil played an important part in the process of soil removal which occurred. Consequently, a numerical study of axially symmetric isothermal nonlinear gas flow ill a porous medium was undertaken. The paper presents the results and interpretations of the calculations for the particular boundary pressure conditions developed by a Surveyor spacecraft vernier engine mounted 12 in, above a granular material...|$|R
40|$|A General Electric F- 404 {{turbofan}} engine was calibrated for thrust and airflow at the NASA Lewis Propulsion System Laboratory {{in support of}} future flight tests of the X- 29 aircraft. Tests were conducted with and without augmentation, over a range of flight conditions, including the two design points of the airplane. Data obtained during the altitude tests {{will be used to}} correct two independent gross thrust calculation routines which will be installed and operated on the airplane to determine in-flight gross thrust. Corrected airflow data as a function of corrected fan speed collapsed onto a single curve. Similarly, trends were observed and defined for both augmented and dry thrust. Overall agreement between measured data and F- 404 Engine Spec Deck data was within 2 percent for airflow and 6 percent for thrust. The results of an uncertainty analysis for thrust and airflow is presented. In addition to the thrust calibration, the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> boundary layer <b>pressure</b> and temperatures were surveyed at selected condition and engine power levels to obtain data for another NASA F- 404 program. Test data for these surveys are presented...|$|R
50|$|The {{process is}} {{controlled}} by a cylindrical cell rotor driven by the engine crankshaft via a belt or chain. Individual cells alternately open and close the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> and fresh air apertures. When the aperture on the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> side is reached, pressurized <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> flows into the cell and compresses the fresh air there. As the cell rotor continues to rotate and reaches the aperture on the inlet side, the compressed air flows to the engine. Before the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> can flow, the aperture is closed again and the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> column is reflected before entering the engine. The <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> exits at high speed, sucking further intake air into the cell behind it, repeating the process.|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{cylinder}} {{internal combustion}} engine (1) comprises a first lambda probe (11) and a first catalyst (12) arranged in a first <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> pipe (8), a second lambda probe (13) and a second catalyst arranged in a second <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> pipe (9), and a common controlled throttle valve (6) arranged in the inlet region (4) of the cylinders (A-D). Both <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> pipes open into a complete <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> pipe (10). - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a process for partially switching off the multiple cylinder {{internal combustion engine}}. Preferred Features: A third catalyst is arranged in the complete <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> pipe or in the second <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> pipe behind the second lambda probe.
