25|$|Jim Wyatt, of the Tennesseean, {{reports that}} Ringer is the {{favorite}} for the 3rd string job, and almost a lock to make the roster. Fullback Ahmard Hall said “He’s a character guy, and you could tell that from the start, He’s the total package. You rarely get that combination of humility and natural athletic ability and I think he has that great combination. You combine those two and you get someone who could be unstoppable.’’ Of all the praise, Ringer responded, “I have to give credit to how I was brought up. I {{grew up in a}} religious family and I know without God none of this would be possible for me anyway, so that definitely keeps me humble. My personality is not to boast and brag about the accomplishments and things I am trying to do. Actions speak louder than words and that is what <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> strive for.’’ In a 17-23 loss to the Cleveland Browns, Ringer only had one run for two yards. Ringer finished off the pre-season with a 7 carry 18 yard performance, in a 27-13 win over the Green Bay Packers.|$|E
500|$|Gyllenhaal is {{politically}} active. He shot {{a commercial for}} Rock the Vote and, along with his sister, visited the University of Southern California {{to encourage students to}} vote during the 2004 U.S. election. He also campaigned for Democratic Presidential candidate John Kerry. He has said, however, that [...] "it frustrates me when actors talk politics; I'm political and I make choices in my movies that I think are political. <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> say things with what I do. Rightly or wrongly, young actors have all the power." [...] In an interview for Rendition, he remarked that [...] "it's a sad time when actors are politicians and politicians are actors".|$|E
2500|$|Burnham's first {{experience}} with controversy regarding his music came on March 3, 2009, when fifteen Westminster College students (members of the campus' Gay-Straight Alliance, Black Students Association, International Club, and Cultural Diversity Organization) protested his concert there that evening. [...] Of the controversy, he said, [...] "It's so ironic because gay bashers were the ones labeling me in high school ... <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> write satire that's well-intentioned. [...] But those intentions have to be hidden. [...] It can't be completely clear and that's what makes it comedy." [...] Despite the college's admission that they had booked Burnham while ignorant of his show's material, dean of students John Comerford praised the opportunities for discourse the controversy brought the school.|$|E

And besides, I felt my {{responsibility}} as a mother, so much. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> reasoning, <b>and</b> reasoning failed. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> coaxing, <b>and</b> coaxing failed. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> scolding <b>and</b> scolding failed. But I was bound to try everything, you know, with such a charge upon my hands. Where would have been my duty to my poor lost boy, if <b>I</b> had not <b>tried</b> everything!' ...|$|R
2500|$|Lupe Fiasco was {{supposedly}} {{going to release}} a triple album, titled LupE.N.D. as his third and final record, but his contract with Atlantic Records prevented him from doing so. From then he postponed LupE.N.D. indefinitely and intended on releasing an album tentatively titled The Great American Rap Album in June 2009. Instead, the album was also postponed and he announced that a new album was in the works, originally titled We Are Lasers and then changed to Lasers. [...] "Lasers" [...] is a backronym for [...] "Love Always Shines Everytime, Remember 2 Smile". Referring to {{the title of the}} album, Fiasco has stated: [...] "I've always had that word in my head, I'm a word guy. And I thought 'lasers' would be a dope name for an album, so when I came up with it I just put it in my 'think-tank' and let it evolve and came up with different meanings for it. That’s why I made it an acronym [...] to give it a new mould, a new understanding, but still playing off the idea that it's bringing light to different circumstances which is what <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> do - bringing understanding and light and awareness to different projects that are going on in the world, and 'L.A.S.E.R.S' is no different.|$|E

In English in contrast, pied-piping in such constellations is impossible, e.g. *the book which to read <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>and</b> *the book to read which <b>I</b> <b>tried.</b>|$|R

[...] There was another pause. The secrecy in which Mr. Blyth chose to conceal Madonna's history, and the sequestered place in the innermost drawer of his bureau where he kept the Hair Bracelet, began vaguely to connect themselves together in Mat's mind. A curious smile hovered about his lips, and the cunning look brightened in his eyes. [...] "The Painter-Man won't tell anything about her, won't he? Perhaps that thing in his drawer will."
