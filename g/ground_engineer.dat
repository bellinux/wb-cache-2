25|$|On March 8, 1994, RA-86119 (c/n 087) {{parked at}} Delhi airport {{was struck by}} a landing Sahara India Boeing 737 (VT-SIA) flown by a trainee; both {{aircraft}} were destroyed. All 4 crew on the 737 were killed. Two Aeroflot employees, a Russian <b>ground</b> <b>engineer</b> and an airport worker were killed on the ground.|$|E
25|$|On Monday, 4 April 2011, a Georgian Airways CRJ-100ER, {{registration}} 4L-GAE, chartered by MONUSCO {{was planned}} {{to carry out}} a flight on route Kinshasa - Kisangani- Kinshasa, using call sign UNO 834. At Kisangani, 29 passengers boarded the aircraft for the flight to Kinshasa; 594kg of luggage was loaded for this sector. Besides the Captain and the Co-Pilot, the crew consisted of a Flight Attendant and a <b>Ground</b> <b>Engineer.</b> Pilot in Command (PIC) was the Pilot Flying (PF) while the Co-Pilot was the Pilot Not flying (PNF) for this sector. The aircraft took off from Kisangani for Kinshasa at 11:18 and climbed to Flight Level 300. At 12:39, UNO 834 requested for descent and was cleared to descend to flight level 100. Meanwhile, on the on-board weather radar, the crew were able to notice presence of severe weather around and over Kinshasa airfield. At 12:49, the crew again sought latest weather information from Kinshasa ATC. They were informed that Kinshasa was reporting wind 210 degrees with 8 knots, visibility 8km, and thunderstorm over the station. The aircraft later cleared to land in the airport.|$|E

2500|$|The inquiry {{received}} {{evidence from}} the aerodrome control officer on duty in the control tower {{at the time of}} the takeoff. [...] He observed the aircraft climb at a steeper rate than any airline-operated aircraft he had seen previously. [...] When the aircraft was at a height of about [...] the left wing dropped sharply, as if in a stall. [...] The nose dipped and the aircraft seemed to rotate through 180 degrees before dropping vertically. [...] A <b>ground</b> <b>engineer</b> also saw the aircraft climb abruptly before it nosed over and twisted twice as it dived to the ground.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, the {{principle}} of strict cost control was also applied to aircraft maintenance and flight operations. This entailed outsourcing all engineering work as the fleet {{was too small to}} warrant Lloyd International setting up its own maintenance department. It furthermore involved [...] "buying" [...] flying hours at a fixed rate. Moreover, through Wheelock Marden, Lloyd International was indirectly associated with the Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company. This enabled it to draw on that company's extensive spares pool in Hong Kong. (Other than Hong Kong, Lloyd International pursued a policy of not stationing any spares along regular routes flown by its aircraft. Instead each aircraft carried its own spares kit — usually consisting of a spare wheel and brake — and a <b>ground</b> <b>engineer.)</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|An inquest to {{the four}} deaths was held at Hendon on 16 December 1920. [...] One of the {{survivors}} explained the events to the inquest, although he saw the engines being tested before the flight he did not hear any problems with them but the aircraft {{was not able to}} climb above 100 feet and suddenly struck a tree. After the aircraft had crashed he immediately climbed over the debris and escaped through a window. Other evidence came from another passenger, the dispatcher {{and one of the first}} to arrive on the scene, a <b>ground</b> <b>engineer</b> and the pilot who had flown the aircraft the previous day; all were questioned but the cause of the aircraft hitting a tree under 50 feet high was not determined. The coroner recorded a verdict that the deceased died from consequence of burns due to the crashing of the aeroplane to the ground after striking a tree; the coroner also said he did not have enough evidence to determine a cause.|$|E
50|$|He drafted {{government}} {{policy on the}} subsidization of flying clubs; licensed many non-military pilots, navigators and ground engineers; and progressed the selection and training of pilots and <b>ground</b> <b>engineers</b> for the Royal Indian Air Force.|$|R
50|$|With about 8 ft of {{the twenty}} feet {{structure}} {{likely to be}} above <b>ground,</b> <b>engineers,</b> architects and town planners fear {{that it would be}} an eyesore in a heritage zone.

25|$|<b>Ground</b> <b>engineers</b> {{declared}} that a minor ring misalignment on Atlantis' Orbiter Docking System (ODS) {{is of no}} issue. They cleared the system for undocking and redocking with the space station—a safe haven scenario which would only be initiated in the event Atlantis has {{to return to the}} ISS. The docking ring had lost alignment during ring extension on flight day 2.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} Flight Day 2 Execute Package, <b>ground</b> <b>engineers</b> also {{provided}} further information on the circuit breaker failure seen at launch.The breaker (Channel 1 Aerosurfaces, ASA 1) {{is part of the}} shuttle's Flight Control Systems (FCS), a subsystem of the guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) systems. The failure would have no impact to the mission, due to redundant systems.|$|R

50|$|It was {{normally}} {{the duty of}} Turkish Airlines flight engineer or chief <b>ground</b> <b>engineer</b> {{to ensure that all}} cargo and passenger doors were securely closed before takeoff. In the case of Flight 981 however, the airline did not have a <b>ground</b> <b>engineer</b> on duty {{at the time of the}} departure, and the flight engineer for Flight 981 failed to check the door. Although French media outlets called for Mahmoudi to be arrested, the crash investigators stated that it was unrealistic to expect an untrained, low-wage earning baggage handler who could not read the warning sticker to be responsible for the safety of the aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The {{starboard}} wing struck water first, tearing the plane into three parts.

50|$|An {{investigation}} into the crash revealed that the flight crew had used the incorrect speeds and thrust setting during the take-off attempt, with incorrect take-off data being calculated when preparing the flight (incorrect V speed calculation, {{as the result of}} the crew re-using a lighter take-off weight of 240,000 kg from the aircraft's previous take-off at Bradley, instead of the correct weight of 353,000 kg). The official report blamed the company for serious non-conformances to flight and duty time, with no regulations or company rules governing maximum duty periods for loadmasters and <b>ground</b> <b>engineers,</b> resulting in increased potential for fatigue-induced errors.|$|R
50|$|A 1939 {{survey by}} Imperial Airways notes that prior notice of {{intended}} arrival {{should be sent}} to P.W.D. Kampala: that Customs, Health and Immigration, and flares for a night landing were also available with prior notice. There was a small P.W.D. workshop, and a Wilson Airways <b>ground</b> <b>engineer.</b> There were no wireless facilities, the nearest W/T station being at Entebbe with the callsign VQQ.|$|E

5000|$|Ground {{witnesses}} {{stated that}} just after taking off, a strange noise was heard which resembled explosion. A <b>ground</b> <b>engineer</b> gave the following statement:"I {{was on the}} parking lot and I saw the plane take off on runway 02. Just after take-off, the aircraft swerved slightly to the left, then righted itself on the track and at that moment I noticed that the aircraft was losing speed and altitude, still with its landing gear down, until the moment of the crash, when there was a total explosion.” ...|$|E
50|$|Accordingly, PIA {{emerged with}} the most {{favourable}} contract conditions and upon commencement, offered to invest 20% in shares. PIA provided a management team which would run the airline from its inception. The early generation of Air Malta pilots, as well as flight and <b>ground</b> <b>engineers</b> owe their training and initial knowledge to PIA. The first batches of novices were dispatched to Pakistan where they undertook extensive training. Two Boeing 720s were also leased from PIA for a five-year period. In 1973, PIA assigned a general manager and four senior managers to Air Malta who {{would be responsible for}} the airline's marketing, financing, flight and ground operations.|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s {{when the}} current Bus Station in Ormskirk {{replaced}} the Ribble one, the first bus {{to arrive at the}} interchange,scraped the <b>ground.</b> The <b>engineers</b> discovered that there was insufficient clearance for certain types of buses.|$|R
50|$|NASA's Mission Management Team {{also decided}} to extend Atlantis' mission by two days and to add a fourth spacewalk. John Shannon, the head of NASA's STS-117 Mission Management Team during the day's mission {{briefing}} told reporters that the extra time would give the crew to complete the ISS assembly tasks and allow <b>ground</b> <b>engineers</b> to draw up plans to repair the damaged blanket on the OMS pod of Atlantis. NASA deemed that the torn blanket, while not a flight risk to the shuttle crew during reentry, could lead to some damage to the OMS pod's internal honeycomb-like graphite-epoxy structure. Such a damage would require additional time to repair once the Shuttle returns to Earth, NASA said.|$|R
5000|$|When the {{aircraft}} arrived from London earlier that morning, the previous flight crew had reported a frozen door seal and abnormal noises {{coming from the}} right aft service door. They requested a full inspection of the door. The inspection {{was carried out by}} a <b>ground</b> <b>engineer</b> who then performed a pressurization leak check. In order to carry out this check without requiring {{the aircraft}}s engines, the pressurisation system was set to [...] "manual". However, the engineer failed to reset it to [...] "auto" [...] on completion of the test.|$|E
5000|$|Saudi Arabian Airlines Flight 3830, 22:08 Thursday August 23, 2001. The Boeing 747-368 {{rolled into}} a {{drainage}} ditch at Kuala Lumpur Airport and toppled forward causing the severe {{damage to the}} nose section. Reportedly, the aircraft was being taxied by a <b>ground</b> <b>engineer</b> on the no. 2 and 3 engines. When {{trying to make a}} turn brakes and steering had no effect and the aircraft continued into the ditch. It is said that the aux hydraulic pumps switches (which actuate brakes and steering) were in the off position.|$|E
50|$|Arthur Butler OBE (1902-1980) was an English-Australian aviator {{whose first}} {{aviation}} experience {{was as a}} toolmaker and later <b>ground</b> <b>engineer</b> in Sydney then Hay, New South Wales. Butler was engineer to pilot Francis Stewart Briggs who taught Butler to fly at Hay. After getting a pilot's license, he became a barnstormer before in 1934 winning the contract for the Charleville, Queensland to Cootamundra, New South Wales leg of the England-Australia airmail route. The Butler Air Transport Co lost the contract on its expiry in 1938, but went on to operate as a civil airline, serving country towns in New South Wales and Queensland.|$|E
40|$|Sustainable Geotechnics" may be {{considered}} as a discipline in ground engineering, appearing recently in the construction industry in response to the emerging Low Carbon Economy concerning the global challenges of climate change, diminishing fossil fuel reserves, and environmental management. In the UK Low Carbon Economy is often considered in terms of 'decarbonisation' of buildings, transport, industry, and power sector. This is to be addressed using a wide variety of sustainable approaches, which produce great challenges and opportunities to <b>ground</b> <b>engineers.</b> This paper discusses how the emerging Low Carbon Economy will affect the design and construction of low-carbon buildings and infrastructure as well as innovation covering some of the sustainable approaches recognized by ground engineering communities...|$|R
