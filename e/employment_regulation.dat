40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of country <b>employment</b> <b>regulations</b> on the {{formation}} of corporate groups in Europe. While <b>employment</b> <b>regulations</b> in some European countries impose substantial constraints on external labor markets, these regulations {{do not apply to}} internal labor markets of corporate groups. Using a comprehensive firm-level dataset covering 15 West European countries, we study the strategic response of firms to increased <b>employment</b> <b>regulations.</b> We document the presence of a specific mechanism through which regulations affect corporate groups: internal labor markets. We find that the propensity of firms to be affi liated with groups is larger where country regulations and industry turnover are jointly high. This result is especially strong for smaller firms, which do not have their own internal labor market, and for affi liates of large and diversified groups. We complement our findings with direct evidence on managerial mobility, and show that internal mobility becomes more likely than external mobility as country <b>employment</b> <b>regulations</b> increase...|$|R

50|$|The post of {{deputy judge}} {{advocate}} became vacant {{after the death}} of Ellis Bent on 10 November 1815. Governor Macquarie offered Garling the office of deputy judge advocate on an acting basis from 12 December 1815. Garling held this office until the arrival of John Wylde on 5 October 1816. Garling was progressive in that he apparently allowed emancipist solicitors to practise in the courts over which he presided. Macquaire also appointed Garling a justice of the peace. This was an important appointment in the colony, as at the time, a justice of the peace was in effect a local authority governing planning, liquor trading and <b>employment</b> <b>regulation.</b> Additionally, one of the functions of the deputy judge advocate as a justice of the peace was to sit as a court of petty sessions hearing less serious criminal charges.|$|E
50|$|There {{appears to}} be {{agreement}} among economists on the positive correlation between product market and <b>employment</b> <b>regulation.</b> Although employment protection legislation is {{only one aspect of}} the wide range of regulatory interventions in the labour market, Nicoletti et al. (2000) find evidence suggesting that, across countries, restrictive regulatory environments in the product market tend to be associated with restrictive employment protection policies. They claim that the indicators presented in their paper are closely related, with a statistical correlation of 0.73 (significant at the 1% level). In other words, according to these results, restrictive product market regulations are matched by analogous EPL restrictions to generate a tight overall regulatory environment for firms in their product market {{as well as in the}} allocation of labour inputs. The strong correlation between regulatory regimes inthe product market and EPL also suggests that their influence may have compounded effects on labour market outcomes, making regulatory reform in only one market less effective than simultaneous reform in the two markets.|$|E
50|$|Prondzynski's {{published}} academic output {{has been}} influential {{in particular in}} the field of industrial relations and employment law '. In his early work he argued for a disengagement of the law from industrial relations, taking the position that problems and disputes were better resolved through bargaining than through litigation. The most elaborate expression of his views during this period is contained in his book Freedom of Association and Industrial Relations (1984). He also co-authored the first academic textbook on Irish employment law. However, from the later 1980s onwards his views began to change, and he argued for a framework of <b>employment</b> <b>regulation</b> that took account of economic pressures and the need to maintain competitive conditions. This culminated in his contribution to a major international book in 2000 in which he argued that the law should protect employees' rights, but also promote business success and economic growth. He has also published a number of books and articles on social policy and in particular on the importance of legal protection against discrimination.|$|E

We begin with an unconstrained (separable) farm household model as a benchmark. We add binding constraints on employment outside of the home in section B.A challenge in our empirical work below is disentangling the effects of minimum age of <b>employment</b> <b>regulation</b> from compulsory schooling laws.

40|$|The North American {{model of}} {{workplace}} law is broken, characterized by declining frequency of collective bargaining, {{high levels of}} non-compliance with <b>employment</b> <b>regulation,</b> and political deadlock. This paper explores whether the theory of “decentred regulation” offers useful insights into the challenge of improving compliance with employment standards laws. It argues that the dominant political perspective on workplace regulation today is managerialist. Politicians with a managerialist orientation reject both the pluralist idea that collective bargaining is always preferred and the neoclassical view that it never is. Managerialists accept a role for <b>employment</b> <b>regulation</b> and unions, particularly in dealing with recalcitrant employers who mistreat their employees. The fact that managerialists and pluralists agree on this latter point creates a space for potential movement on workplace law reform. A law that encourages “high road” employment practices, while fast-tracking access to collective bargaining for “low road” employers could encourage greater compliance with <b>employment</b> <b>regulation,</b> while also facilitating collective bargaining at high-risk workplaces. This article examines lessons from scholarship on decentred regulation {{for the design of}} a legal model capable of achieving these results. In particular, it develops and assesses a dual regulatory stream model that restricts existing rights of employers to resist their employees’ efforts to unionize once they have been found in violation of targeted <b>employment</b> <b>regulation...</b>|$|E
