5|$|<b>Fear</b> {{response}} in women during two {{different points in}} the menstrual cycle has been examined. When estrogen is highest in the preovulatory stage, women are significantly better at identifying expressions of <b>fear</b> than women who were menstruating, which is when estrogen levels are lowest. The women were equally able to identify happy faces, demonstrating that the <b>fear</b> response was a more powerful response. To summarize, menstrual cycle phase and the estrogen levels correlates with women’s <b>fear</b> processing.|$|E

5|$|It is, as an Upanishad, {{a part of}} {{the corpus}} of Vedanta {{literature}} that presents the philosophical concepts of Hinduism. The Varaha Upanishad emphasizes that liberation from sorrow and <b>fear</b> requires a human being to know the non-dualistic nature of existence, oneness between Self, Brahman and Vishnu, and the role of Yoga in self-liberation, and lists ten Yamas (virtues) as essential to a liberation of one's soul: nonviolence, satya, asteya, brahmacharya, compassion, rectitude, kshama, non-hypocrisy, mitahara, and shaucha. The text describes the Jivanmukta as one whose inner state, amongst other things, is neither affected by happiness nor by suffering inflicted on him, who does not shrink out of <b>fear</b> from the world, nor the world shrinks from him with <b>fear,</b> and whose sense of calm and inner contentment is free from anger, <b>fear,</b> and joy toward others.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Phobic <b>fears</b> {{are common}} in the general {{population}} and among individuals with major depression (MD). We know little about the prevalence, clinical correlates, and structure of phobic <b>fears</b> in Chinese women with MD. METHODS: We assessed 22 phobic <b>fears</b> in 6017 Han Chinese women with MD. We used exploratory factor analysis to examine the structure of these phobic <b>fears.</b> We examined the relationship between individual phobic <b>fears</b> and the severity of MD, neuroticism, comorbid panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and dysthymia using logistic regression models. RESULTS: The frequency of phobic <b>fears</b> ranged from 3. 0 % (eating in public) to 36. 0 % (snakes). Phobic <b>fears</b> were significantly associated with more severe MD, high neuroticism, and co-morbid panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and dysthymia. Our factor analysis suggested four underlying subgroups of phobic <b>fears</b> which differed in their clinical correlates, severity and patterns of comorbidity. LIMITATIONS: Data were collected retrospectively through interview and recall bias may have affected the results. CONCLUSIONS: Phobic <b>fears</b> are correlated with comorbid MD and more severe MD. These phobic <b>fears</b> clearly subdivide into four subgroups that differ meaningfully from each other...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although social anxiety {{disorder}} (SAD) is classified in the fourth edition of The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) into generalized and non-generalized subtypes, community surveys in Western countries find no evidence of disjunctions in the dose-response relationship between number of social <b>fears</b> and outcomes to support this distinction. We aimed to determine whether this holds across a broader set of developed and developing countries, and whether subtyping according to number of performance versus interactional <b>fears</b> would be more useful. METHODS: The World Health Organization's World Mental Health Survey Initiative undertook population epidemiological surveys in 11 developing and 9 developed countries, using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview to assess DSM-IV disorders. Fourteen performance and interactional <b>fears</b> were assessed. Associations between number of social <b>fears</b> in SAD and numerous outcomes (age-of-onset, persistence, severity, comorbidity, treatment) were examined. Additional analyses examined associations with number of performance <b>fears</b> versus number of interactional <b>fears.</b> RESULTS: Lifetime social <b>fears</b> are quite common in both developed (15. 9 %) and developing (14. 3 %) countries, but lifetime SAD is much {{more common in the}} former (6. 1 %) than latter (2. 1 %) countries. Among those with SAD, persistence, severity, comorbidity, and treatment have dose-response relationships with number of social <b>fears,</b> with no clear nonlinearity in relationships that would support a distinction between generalized and non-generalized SAD. The distinction between performance <b>fears</b> and interactional <b>fears</b> is generally not important in predicting these same outcomes. CONCLUSION: No evidence is found to support subtyping SAD on the basis of either number of social <b>fears</b> or number of performance <b>fears</b> versus number of interactional <b>fears.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
