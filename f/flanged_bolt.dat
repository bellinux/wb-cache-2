40|$|The {{deflections}} of gaskets {{after initial}} tightening largely affect the residual bolt {{forces and the}} tightness of <b>bolted</b> <b>flanged</b> connections. The <b>bolt</b> forces decrease significantly due to the deflections of gaskets after initial tightening in the cases where expanded PTFE gaskets are used. The visco-elastic characteristic of the gaskets is the main cause for the phenomenon. It was shown in the paper PVP 2012 - 78694 that the tightness improved even if the bolt forces reduced in the long term. This is because the gasket becomes packed under a high gasket stress. It is important to estimate the thickness change of gaskets to evaluate the tightness of <b>bolted</b> <b>flanged</b> connections. In this paper, an analytical model of a <b>bolted</b> <b>flanged</b> connection, in which the flanges, the bolts and the gasket are represented by spring constants, is proposed. Experiments were carried out to measure the creep characteristic of the expanded PTFE gasket. The residual bolt forces and the deflection of the gasket were estimated based on the analytical model of the <b>bolted</b> <b>flanged</b> connection and the creep characteristic of the gasket. Thus, the relationship between gasket deflection and the tightness of the <b>bolted</b> <b>flanged</b> connection are clarified...|$|R

40|$|It {{is widely}} known that {{resonance}} can quickly lead to failure in vibrating <b>bolted</b> <b>flanged</b> pipe joints. Condition monitoring is performed {{time to time}} in some industries for smooth operation of a system, whereas mostly trial-and-error tests are performed to control vibration. During all this process, the inherent design problems are not considered. A bolted flange joint in piping system is not a simple problem, being the combination of flange, gasket, bolts, and washers. The success of a <b>bolted</b> <b>flanged</b> pipe joint is defined by the “static mode of load” in the joint. However, it has been recognized that a “dynamic mode of load” governs in a gasketed <b>bolted</b> <b>flanged</b> pipe joint, which leads to its failure due to flange rotation, providing flange yielding, fatigue of bolts, and gasket crushing. This paper presents results of detailed 3 D finite element and mathematical modal analysis under bolt up to determine natural frequencies and mode shapes of gasketed flanged joints with and without raised face in comparison to the nongasketed flange joint...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Based on the time-correlated leakage {{model and}} fuzzy random {{probability}} theory, {{a formula for}} calculating fuzzy random reliability of sealing performance of <b>bolted</b> <b>flanged</b> connections was derived. The optimization variables were defined according to the sensitivity analysis of design parameters on fuzzy reliability of sealing performance. A fuzzy reliability optimization design method of flange was investigated, in which both the tightness of <b>bolted</b> <b>flanged</b> connections {{and the strength of}} flange were taken into consideration. As an example, an integral welding necked pipe flange was designed according to the optimization design method proposed in this paper. The designed flange not only satisfies the requirements of flange strength and sealing reliability of connections, but also its weight is reduced by 16 % compared with that prescribed in the standard...|$|R
40|$|Fiber {{reinforced}} plastic (FRP) materials {{have been used}} in the chemical and process industries for several decades, chiefly because of the ability of many FRP materials to resist attack by various chemicals. FRP tanks, pressure vessels and piping have successfully been used to replace expensive equipment formerly made in stainless steel or nickel alloys. Although the laminate theory has been used to establish design formulas for cylindrical and spherical shells, little work has been done to investigate <b>bolted</b> <b>flanged</b> connections. The ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code or the codes of other industrialized countries do not include specific rules for the design of FRP <b>bolted</b> <b>flanged</b> connections. Up to now, the only work done on fiber {{reinforced plastic}} flanges has either been experimental investigations, or finite element analyses. No attempt has been made on a stress analysis of <b>bolted</b> <b>flanged</b> connections based on the laminate theory. Thus the current design practice is merely an extension of metallic flange design methods. In this dissertation, two methods are proposed for a stress analysis of fiber reinforced plastic flanged connections with full face gaskets, using classical and shear deformation laminate theory, respectively. A sample calculation using the first proposed method is included. In order to verify the analytical results, a finite element analysis with 3 -D anisotropic layered solid elements, using ANSYS is performed. Finally, an experimental investigation into the effects of outside to inside diameter ratios on the flange stress distribution and maximum stress values is conducted...|$|R
40|$|Limited work is {{available}} in the literature on the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis of <b>bolted</b> <b>flanged</b> pipe joints. From previous comparative reliability studies of both gasketed and non-gasketed <b>bolted</b> <b>flanged</b> pipe joints, generally it is found that both the joints types are of high integrity and perform well in excellent service under appropriate installation and maintenance conditions.

This study reported herein presents a detailed failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) in the light of industrial surveys, analysis, experimental work and subsequent observations in addition to previous studies. The aim of the study is to increase the reliability knowledge of the gasketed and non-gasketed flanged pipe joints and thereby to increase the basis for finding the optimal pipe connection based on surveys, observation and experimental studies performed...|$|R

40|$|The {{future of}} new {{nuclear power plant}} {{construction}} will depend {{in large part on}} the ability of designers to reduce capital, operations, and maintenance costs. One of the methods proposed, is to enhance the modularity of the designs in which the basic plant is broken down into modules, each of which is built offsite at a "factory", transported to the plant site, and assembled into a working plant using a minimum amount of labor and tooling. The value of this approach is that it improves overall quality, reduces site field work and rework, and speeds the construction of the plant. This approach also takes advantage of economies of mass-production, rather than relying on economy of scale to reduce costs. The ability to remove and replace modules for repair and maintenance also leads to reduced costs and downtime. Past work at MIT has resulted in a reference design that takes into account modularity. Based on this reference cycle design, a detailed analysis and modularity design of a power producing plant was performed. This design takes into account the goals for the modularity and construction approach. (cont.) The plant takes the factory approach to its logical conclusion, resulting in a "virtual factory" where each major component is integrated into a modular space-frame by its manufacturer. Each module is designed to be transported by truck (although, if the necessary infrastructure is available the modules could be transported at potentially lower cost by rail or barge) to the construction site. The plant site itself requires only simple excavation and the plant containment building is a simple, reinforced poured concrete structure. Assembly of the plant is simple by comparison to conventional facilities as the modularity approach requires that each space-frame module be stacked together, pipe <b>flanged</b> <b>bolted</b> together, a self-test performed, and the plant started. In order to make this assembly method possible a pressure-backed insulation system was designed. This insulation system reduces the temperature of the pressure boundary, enabling the use of lower-cost alloys for system construction. The metallic liner and insulation layer also reduce the temperature swings of the piping and vessel walls, reducing thermal expansion loads that must be borne by the structure of the system. (cont.) To enable flange-joints between component modules a scavenged flange design was created. This flange design enables redundant sealing of the pressure boundary, and also prevents Helium loss and contamination of the plant. This design also enables monitoring of the flange integrity. This design should enable the MIT pebble bed reactor to meet the cost, operations and maintenance goals of an advanced reactor. by Marc Vincent Berte. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|<b>Bolted</b> <b>flanged</b> joints {{comprise}} {{an assembly}} {{of a number}} of important individual components, which are required to perform well together in service. The ideal requirement for a bolted flange joint is a 'zero-leak' condition. However, whilst recommended design procedures for bolted flange joints are available in international codes and standards, leakage problems are still faced by industry. These are common in both normal operating (internal pressure loading) and critical event conditions. The drive is, therefore, to find a flange joint assembly, which provides 'zero-leak condition' and requires little or no maintenance and handling. Considerable investigation in the area of optimised bolted joints has been in progress for the past 10 years comparing traditional gasketed joints and 'compact non-gasketed' joints, using both analytical and experimental approaches. In this present study, two-dimensional non-linear finite element studies have been performed for both gasketed and non-gasketed bolted flange pipe joints. Based on the stress results for the flange and the bolt and the flange rotation/displacement, compact non-gasketed flange joints are shown to be a viable and preferable alternative to the conventional gasketed flange joints. Recommendations are made for a best-fit flange model for static load conditions with 'zero-leak' sealing in a flange joint...|$|R
30|$|Taking the {{advantages}} of low and high temperatures, low and high pressures and corrosion, the metal sealing gaskets are suitable for oil-gas exploitation, chemical industry and nuclear industry, where rubber seals are prohibited [12]. SPMC is a static metal seal without gasket, and the optimal sealing performance is the key technology. Up to now the researches of the pipeline connection are extensive, but few of them focus {{on the design of}} connector without gasket. In the design of a connector with gasket, the gasket factor and minimum gasket seating stress should be determined according to the design codes [13, 14] subject to gasket material and structural. These codes are based on a series of assumptions and might not define calculation procedures for sealing performance in detail [15]. Persson [16] and Kazeminia et al. [17] revaluated the leakage of metallic seal, which was used to design <b>bolted</b> <b>flanged</b> connections. Zhao et al. [18], established the mathematical relationship between the contact stress of metal sealing ring governing the sealing performance, the structural parameters and operating pressure, but did not consider the plastic deformation of metallic gasket. Sawa et al. [19] and Takaki et al. [20] studied the contact pressure on the sealing surface by elastic-plastic finite element analysis with regard of nonlinearity of gasket and internal pressure. However, the analysis is for the spiral wound gasket only. Nitta et al. [21], analyzed the critical contact pressure to eliminate the radial leakage paths by the quantitative analysis of the leakage, but did not discover the critical contact pressure to fully block the leakage paths. Using a finite element analysis approach, Joshi et al. [22], and Abid et al. [23] studied the flange connection without gasket, which concluded surface profiles, thickness of flange and bolt pre-stress had effects on the stress in the flange and bolts as well as flange rotation and displacement, but the effects on sealing performance wasn’t investigated. Guindani et al. [24], studied the deformation recovery of sealing material and optimized the sealing performance of rubber. Bouzid et al. [25] and Wu et al. [26] proved the mean contact pressure and its distribution on sealing surface took important effects on sealing performance. By finite element analysis and experiment, Noga et al. [27] proved the suitable contact pressure and width of plastic deformation were the key parameters to guarantee the sealing performance of flange connection without gasket. However, the critical values of contact pressure and plastic deformation are not investigated. According to the above researches, the right contact pressure will make the plastic deformation happen on sealing surface and block micro leakage paths. Therefore, the contact pressure is essential for the optimal sealing performance of SPMC.|$|R
40|$|Use of <b>bolted</b> <b>flanged</b> pipe joints is {{very common}} in petrochemical, nuclear and process industry. Welding of pipe to flange results in {{residual}} stress built up and distortions which provide negative effects on the structural integrity and sealing capability of the pipe flange joint. The effects include stress corrosion cracking, brittle fracture, reduced fatigue and creep strengths, poor sealing performance and reduced buckling strength etc. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the extent and distribution of residual stress built up and distortions in the welded pipe-flange joints. The effects of welding parameters, welding procedure, applied mechanical constraints on residual stress built-up and distortions are evaluated. Effort are made to suggest the preventive or corrective measures for the reduction of welding distortions and residual stresses to improve the performance and service life of welded pipe-flange joints. This thesis is organized in three phases. In the first phase, preliminary studies for implementation of numerical technique for welding simulation and selection of appropriate models are performed. In the second phase, welding residual stresses are investigated including their dependence on welding parameters and their mitigation technique. The third phase is associated with the welding deformations. In Chapter- 1, a general introduction of welding deformation and residual stresses and their effect in pipe-flange joints in presented. In Chapter- 2, a comprehensive literature review of experimental and finite element simulation of welding in general and its application in circumferential joint in particular is discussed. Chapter- 3, describes the general finite element formulation and its application technique for material modeling, heat source modeling, modeling of filler material and analysis procedure etc. Chapter- 4, presents a comparative study of two and three-dimensional FE models of the pipe-flange joint subjected to a welding process. The aim of this study was to select an appropriate FE model for forth coming parametric numerical studies with the objective to investigate residual stresses and deformations. In Chapter- 5, experimental validation procedure has been described and a few selective validations are also presented. The objective of this chapter is to establish the reader confidence over the accuracy of numerical results. Chapter- 6, describes the effect of welding (Current and speed) and geometrical (pipe diameter and thickness) parameters on residual stress profile. In Chapter- 7, an analytical study regarding mitigation of residual stresses using mechanical stress relieving is presented and the effects of internal pressure, external pressure and axial pull on the residual stresses are determined. The objective {{of this study is to}} explore the most effective mode of mechanical stress relieving. In Chapter- 8, the issues related to welding procedure specifications are addressed. In this chapter a numerical procedure for modeling of tack welds is suggested. In addition, the effect of tack weld locations on welding deformations and residual stresses are investigated and appropriate position for the tack welds is suggested. The effect of root gap is also analyzed and presented.
