25|$|Individual {{employees}} {{of a local}} government, including the highest-level executives of that body, have no power to bind the local government to a contract that is void due {{to one of the}} above scenarios. This is because the limitations on the power of the local government to contract are a matter of public record. As a general rule, the individual employee is immune from being sued for inadvertently entering into a void contract with a private party. However, this immunity does not extend to the intentional tort of fraud. If a local government employee knowingly and intentionally made a <b>false</b> <b>representation</b> to a third party that the local government would be bound to a particular contract, that employee could be sued for damages suffered by the third party's reliance on that false promise.|$|E

2500|$|Depending {{on how a}} court construes negotiations, a {{representation}} could become a term of the contract, {{as well as one}} giving rise to the right to rescind. A misrepresentation that is a term, will entitle the misrepresentee to a simple breach of contract claim, with [...] "expectation damages" [...] for loss of potential profits (subject to remoteness and the duty to mitigate). If the misrepresentation is not a term, then damages may also be available, but only [...] "reliance damages" [...] for losses that have been incurred. Until 1963, the general rule was that only for fraud (i.e. an intentional or reckless misrepresentation) were damages available. For fraud, damages are available for all losses that flow directly from the misrepresentation. However, in its Tenth Report the Law Reform Committee recommended that damages should also be available for negligent misrepresentations. This led to the drafting of the Misrepresentation Act 1967, and just before the Act was passed, the House of Lords also decided in Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd there should be a new claim for negligent misrepresentation at common law. While Hedley Byrne remains an important case for an independent action in tort, MA 1967 section 2(1) was instantly more generous than the common law. It allows damages if the claimant shows a defendant has made a <b>false</b> <b>representation,</b> and then the defendant cannot prove that they had reasonable grounds for making a statement and honestly believed it was true. So while the common law would put the burden of proof on a claimant to show a defendant made a negligent misstatement, MA 1967 s 2(1) shifts the burden of proof to the defendant. The measure of damages is also more generous under the Act than at common law, because just as the Law Reform Report was drafted, the House of Lords was introducing a limit on the quantum of damages for negligence to losses that are reasonably foreseeable. MA 1967 section 2(1), however, was drafted by reference to state the same damages were available as for fraud. So in Royscot Trust Ltd v Rogerson, the Court of Appeal held that even where {{a representation}} is negligent, and not fraud, the same quantum of damages is available as for fraud. This is controversial among academics who argue that fraud is more morally culpable than negligent behaviour, and should therefore deserve a more severe limit on compensation, though it is not entirely resolved what the proper circumstances for remoteness ought to be. Under section 2(2) the court has the discretion to substitute the right to rescind a contract for a small misrepresentation with an award of damages. Under section 3, a court has the power to strike down clauses excluding remedies for misrepresentation if they fail the reasonableness test in the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977.|$|E

40|$|This thesis investigates whether children's {{understanding}} of both mental and non-mental representations can {{be accounted for}} by the same underlying competence in representational understanding. This research question stems from a long-standing dispute between domain-specificity and domain-generality in understanding mental representations.

I also outline the confounding of other cognitive skills such as language and executive function during the assessment of representational understanding. This motivates the subsequent empirical work for this thesis which includes (1) the development of novel measures for assessing children's {{understanding of}} non-mental representations and (2) the investigation of the equivalence between children's understanding of mental and non-mental representations. Evidence for this equivalence was shown by a transfer of training between a new <b>false</b> non-mental <b>representation</b> task and an existing <b>false</b> mental <b>representation</b> task presented in Chapter 2. With the use of another novel <b>false</b> non- mental <b>representation</b> task which minimises and eliminates the confounding factors of language and cognitive inhibition, the two experiments in Chapter 3 further indicated that the equivalence between false non-mental and <b>false</b> mental <b>representation</b> tasks could not be explained by these confounding factors. Chapter 4 extended the research from typical to atypical development, namely Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) as individuals with ASD are known to be specifically impaired in processing social and mental information. Intriguingly, the findings in Chapter 3 were shown to be generalised to children with ASD. Finally, the consistent findings of the five experiments reported in this thesis are discussed in relation to the theoretical accounts and neurological basis of typical and atypical cognitive development...|$|R

And, that his majesty was deceived in this grant by a <b>false</b> <b>representation,</b> it was said, needed no further proof than the patent itself.--William Wood by it was empowered to coin 360 tons of copper into halfpence and farthings, which would have made £90,000, about the fifth part of all the current cash of Ireland; for that is not reckoned, by those who suppose it most, to be £500,000. Now, the current cash of England is reckoned above twenty millions; in proportion, therefore, if Ireland wants £90,000 England will want four millions.
