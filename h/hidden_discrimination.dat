In principle, negative effects can arise from communication problems between people of different cultural backgrounds, from <b>hidden</b> <b>discrimination</b> and even from open clashes. On the other hand, positive effects are possible, since workers from different cultures and nations may possess complementary skills and problem-solving abilities.

40|$|Since the {{enactment}} of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 the courts have struggled to define the burdens of proof surrounding the central issue of an employer 2 ̆ 7 s alleged discriminatory intent. What evolved was the McDonnell Douglas framework, premised upon established concepts of circumstantial proof and inference. The approach permits plaintiffs lacking direct proof to nonetheless establish {{a violation of the}} Act by proving that the employer 2 ̆ 7 s explanation of the challenged decision was pretextual. In St. Mary 2 ̆ 7 s Honor Center v. Hicks, a closely-divided Supreme Court substantially altered the McDonnell Douglas framework. Discrediting the reasons offered by the employer for its decision no longer suffices to establish a violation of Title VII. Rather, plaintiffs must somehow prove that the pretext was offered to <b>hide</b> <b>discrimination,</b> and not for some other motivation. Moreover, the trier of fact is permitted to construct its own explanation of the events even though that scenario was not offered by either party at trial. As a result, plaintiffs must be prepared to discredit stated and unstated non-discriminatory reasons for the employer 2 ̆ 7 s action.

40|$|The HIV/AIDS {{pandemic}} {{has reached}} historical heights. The number of infected people {{has been rising}} constantly and the HIV crisis has been spreading {{to more and more}} countries. Testimony to this is the higher number of infected people. Unless wide scale comprehensive preventive, care and treatment measures are taken, the epidemic will claim more and more lives. Its legal, social and economic impacts are numerous in the field of health, in education, agriculture, human resources, etc. The rights of people who are infected are regularly violated. Those who live with the disease are victims of violence and they, consequently, bear the mark of a situation of acute precariousness. From the time the epidemic was discovered, people living with HIV/AIDS, face various levels of stigmatization and <b>hidden</b> <b>discrimination</b> which are tantamount to violence. They have faced exclusion in schools, in the work place and elsewhere. Furthermore, people who are marginalized due to their HIV status eventually become the group that is most vulnerable and most exposed to risks of contamination by HIV. Women are a special target because they have faced several types of marginalization such as poverty, cultural status, high levels of illiteracy, a general low level of education, informal and irregular jobs, etc. Ignorance of the way transmission occurs sustains irrational fears of contamination, bringing about prejudices. Discrimination and stigmatization of people living with HIV/AIDS and their companions reduce the efficiency of programs aimed at prevention, treatment and care. The purpose of the study is to show that fundamental human rights commit States to take legal and regulatory measures aimed at eliminating all forms of discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS and other vulnerable groups, in order to safeguard all their fundamental liberties.

40|$|The growing use of {{data mining}} {{practices}} by both government and commercial entities leads to both great promises and challenges. They hold {{the promise of}} facilitating an information environment which is fair, accurate and efficient. At the same time, they might lead to practices which are both invasive and discriminatory, yet in ways the law has yet to grasp. This point is demonstrated by showing how the common measures for mitigating privacy concerns, such as a priori limiting measures (particularly access controls, anonymity and purpose specification) are mechanisms that are increasingly failing solutions against privacy and discrimination issues in this novel context. Instead, a focus on (a posteriori) accountability and transparency may be more useful. This requires improved detection of discrimination and privacy violations as well as designing and implementing techniques that are discrimination-free and privacy-preserving. This requires further (technological) research. But even with further technological research, there may be new situations and new mechanisms through which privacy violations or discrimination may take place. Novel predictive models can prove {{to be no more}} than sophisticated tools to mask the 2 ̆ 2 classic 2 ̆ 2 forms of <b>discrimination,</b> by <b>hiding</b> <b>discrimination</b> behind new proxies.

Conspecifics use these marks to distinguish those flowers that {{have recently been}} emptied and, so, avoid them. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess how widespread this behavior is. Evidence for direct detection of reward levels was found in two bee species: Agapostemon nasutus was able to detect directly pollen availability in flowers with exposed anthers, while Apis mellifera appeared to be able to detect nectar levels of tubular flowers. A third species, Trigona fulviventris, avoided flowers that had recently been visited by conspecifies, regardless of reward levels, probably by using scent marks. Three further bee/flower systems were examined in which there was no detectable discrimination among flowers. We argue that bees probably rely on direct detection of rewards where this is allowed by the structure of the flower and on scent marks when feeding on flowers where the rewards are <b>hidden.</b> However, <b>discrimination</b> does not always occur.

50|$|During market-oriented reforms, {{there was}} {{widespread}} evidence of employment {{discrimination in the}} hiring process. Gender discrimination during recruitment {{can be divided into}} two main categories: explicit and <b>hidden</b> gender <b>discrimination.</b> Explicit gender discrimination refers to directly stated restrictions on women in the recruitment process. Hidden gender discrimination occurs primarily through preferential hiring of men. Generally, there are three kinds of gender discrimination in the process of hiring in contemporary China. First, gender restrictions on career and posts creates an environment where women are generally only welcomed into certain career roles that match traditional gender roles for women—mainly domestic, secretarial, or factory work. Second, gender discrimination in recruitment often affects women of reproductive age who are frequently discriminated against in hiring due to potential future loss of productivity resulting from pregnancy. Third, age discrimination affects many women, especially those working in the service industry where youth is a key component of success in the workplace. In this sector, women under the age of 30 are frequently denied jobs. Female job-seekers over the age of 40 in most industries particularly struggle with age discrimination, despite no longer being of child-bearing age. The age limit for men is more relaxed, usually under 40 or 45 years of age. While there are laws in place to prevent such practices, there are few enforcement mechanisms to ensure the laws are followed. As a result, recruitment in China's national civil units and national government departments as well as state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises frequently fail to comply with these national equality employment laws.|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] These are {{challenges}} that {{are familiar to}} disabled {{people all over the}} world. Challenges such as these make many persons with disabilities in Ukraine feel as if they live in a “parallel world,” one separate from that enjoyed by “able-bodied” people. The disabled in Ukraine face both <b>hidden</b> and open <b>discrimination</b> in their daily lives, and they are stigmatized through popular stereotypes of disabled persons as inferior, deformed, and even contaminating. These attitudes stem in part from the Soviet-era policies towards the disabled, which perpetuated such harmful stereotypes. Persons with visible disabilities (i. e., spinal injuries, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, mental problems, and others) were isolated in their homes, hidden from the public and thus made seemingly invisible. Since disability was seen as a defect and as a tragedy, the Soviet regime pursued a policy of compensation. The invisibility of disabled persons positioned them as a non-problem. Their lives were not discussed, and there was practically no public debate about their needs. When attempts were made to rehabilitate people with disabilities, rehabilitation was primarily medical and vocational in nature, an approach that reflects the ideology that the problem is located within the individual, who needs to be changed/improved (i. e., given maximum physical functioning or gainful employment) ...|$|R

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the problem of gender {{inequality}} and gender discrimination against human by means of the legal regulation by the Family Code. As a result of the research, the conclusion has been made that the transformation of gender relations on the level of socio-normative regulation should lead to the achievement of the real, rather than formal equality of genders in marriage and family relations. It has been stated that instead of traditionally disparate (matriarchal, tendentious and androcidarical) distribution of roles between men and women, the concept of the equality, that provides equal opportunities for both partners must come. Thus, the issue of women’s socio-gender status, which is offered or may be offered to them in society, where the matriarchal-geterical type of gender differentiation replaces the egalitarian type, arises from the social life by itself. Gender analysis of the current Ukrainian family legislation gives an adequate response to it. It has been proven that the elimination of gender discrimination is a key imperative of the regulation and institutionalization of family relations provided the implementation of a package of measures, which make the long-term impact on society and its institutions. This will allow overcoming the matriarchal racism and women sexism and will end the long period of gender inequality and injustice, when the male part of the Ukrainian population was subjected to <b>hidden</b> gender <b>discrimination</b> through the breach of the socio-normative parity of both genders representatives in the legal institutionalization of the family. As to the author, the strategic goal of gender relations’ transformation in the family and legal sphere is to change the culture of gender interaction, to replace hierarchical relationships by the partnership, to bring the values of peacefulness and life-creation as the core values of the educated androcracy to the social consciousness.

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the problem of gender {{inequality}} and gender discrimination against men by means of the legal regulation of the Family Code. As a result of the research it has been concluded by the author that the transformation of gender relations on the level of social-normative regulation should lead to the achievement of the actual, rather than formal, equality of the sexes in marriage and family relations. It has been stated that the concept of equability that provides equal opportunities for two partners should arise instead of traditionally disparate (matriarchal-tendentious and androcidarical) distribution of roles between men and women. Thus, the issue of social-gender status of men, which is offered or may be offered to them in a society where matriarchal-geterical type of gender differentiation is being replaced by the egalitarian type, arises from the social practice by itself; and gender analysis of the current family legislation of Ukraine allows responding it properly. It has been proved that the elimination of gender discrimination is a key imperative of regulation and institutionalization of family relations in conditions of the implementation of a package of measures, which provide for the long-term impact on society and its institutions. This will allow overcoming the matriarchal racism and sexism by women and will end a long period of gender inequality and injustice, when the male part of the Ukrainian population was subjected to the <b>hidden</b> gender <b>discrimination</b> through violations of social-normative parity of both sexes in the legal institutionalization of the family. The author believes that the strategic goal of gender relations’ transformation in the family and legal sphere lays in changing the culture of interaction between sexes, replacement of the hierarchy relationship by the partnership relationships, introduction of the values of peacefulness and life-creation as core values of well-educated androkratie in the social consciousness. Understanding that gender is not a basis for discrimination is the key to positive social transformation in every sphere of public life. More over, discrimination on all other grounds of social stratification (class, national, racial, political, cultural, etc.) in an egalitarian society is not only illegal, but also incompatible with the effective social morality...|$|R
