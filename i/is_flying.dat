The Great Elephant Census team <b>is</b> <b>flying</b> over 20 countries to survey the African savannah elephants with hopes that the accurate and up-to-date data will spur immediate protective actions and long-term conservation management plans.|$|E
5|$|The African river {{martin has}} a chee chee or cheer-cheer-cheer call when it <b>is</b> <b>flying</b> in flocks. It is very vocal during migration, giving harsh gull-like calls, {{and appears to}} have a {{jingling}} courtship song. No calls have been described for the white-eyed river martin.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from the}} rover and its {{bridging}} kits, Jetman {{has access to}} three other pieces of equipment, {{all of which can}} be carried on the bonnet of the rover, albeit one at a time. Bombs must be used to destroy alien bases when they are encountered, which can only be accomplished when Jetman <b>is</b> <b>flying</b> above them. Another piece of equipment is a cannon that may be mounted onto the rear side of the moon rover. The final piece of equipment is a pair of teleporters which can be used to instantaneously transport the player to the teleporter's twin, thus allowing rapid transport around the moon.|$|E
5|$|White-bellied sea eagles feed alone, in pairs, or {{in family}} groups. A pair may {{cooperate}} to hunt. Prey can be eaten while the bird <b>is</b> <b>flying</b> {{or when it}} lands on a raised platform such as its nest. The white-bellied sea eagle skins the victim as it eats it. It is exceptionally efficient at digesting its food, and disgorges only tiny pellets of fragmented bone, fur and feathers.|$|E
5|$|Land {{is defined}} as the surface, subsoil, {{airspace}} and anything permanently attached to the land, such as houses. The rights of landowners over airspace are not unlimited; in Bernstein of Leigh v Skyviews & General Ltd, the action for trespass failed because the violation of airspace took place several hundred metres above the land. This was backed up by the Civil Aviation Act 1982, which provides that it is not trespass if the aircraft <b>is</b> <b>flying</b> at a reasonable height. An overhanging crane can constitute trespass, as in Woolerton v Costain, as can an advertising sign, as in Kelsen v Imperial Tobacco Co. Possession does not necessarily mean the ownership of land, but the right to eject or exclude others from it.|$|E

50|$|El Oro {{entered the}} {{approach}} from the southwest, passing slightly {{west of the}} NDB, as opposed to directly over it. The pilot began the turn correctly, but <b>was</b> <b>flying</b> too fast; the aircraft <b>was</b> <b>flying</b> at 230 knots, rather than the required 180. This took the 727 wide of its intended course; {{by the time it}} came around to a westerly heading, it <b>was</b> <b>flying</b> not towards the runway, but {{into the side of the}} Cumbal Volcano.|$|R
5|$|Michael (Steve Carell) {{arrives at}} work {{for what he}} claims is his second-to-last day before he moves to Colorado {{to live with his}} fiancee, Holly (Amy Ryan). As the day progresses, he tries to have an {{individual}} goodbye with each employee. A phone call with Holly reveals that this is his last day, and he <b>is</b> <b>flying</b> out to Colorado that night. After having a few mini-crises, including getting cold feet, he starts to break down, but regains his composure after speaking with Holly. Pam (Jenna Fischer) leaves the office to supposedly run errands, but takes a break from the workday to see The King's Speech before Michael can say his goodbye to her.|$|E
5|$|Singing also occurs {{outside the}} {{breeding}} season, taking place {{throughout the year}} apart from the moulting period. The songsters are more commonly male although females also sing on occasion. The function of such out-of-season song is poorly understood. Eleven other types of call have been described including a flock call, threat call, attack call, snarl call and copulation call. The alarm call is a harsh scream, and while foraging together common starlings squabble incessantly. They chatter while roosting and bathing, making {{a great deal of}} noise that can cause irritation to people living nearby. When a flock of common starlings <b>is</b> <b>flying</b> together, the synchronised movements of the birds' wings make a distinctive whooshing sound that can be heard hundreds of metres (yards) away.|$|E
5|$|The opening {{sequence}} of the video features Jay Z as a passenger in a car speeding along Mission Road in Los Angeles, where he encounters Beyoncé, {{standing in the middle}} of the road, at the Fourth Street bridge. Beyoncé performs in various dance sequences, beginning with her wearing a white tank top, denim blue shorts, and red high-heels. She performs an elaborate solo dance on a riser. The scene shifts to a gold set with a mock photo shoot, before moving into a scene with dancers detailing Beyoncé and dancing against a wall while wearing caps and full length pants. Jay Z appears and ignites a line of petrol leading to a car parked under the bridge, which explodes in flames. Jay Z performs his rap in front of the burning car, and Beyoncé dances beside him, wearing an exotic silk print over a fur coat, before kicking the valve off a fire hydrant. She continues to dance while the water <b>is</b> <b>flying</b> everywhere. The video ends with Beyoncé and her dancers wearing vibrant Versace dresses in front of a large fan. Their outfits contrast with the neutral colors of the background, the video. Carmit Bachar, a former Pussycat Dolls singer, is one of the dancers.|$|E

25|$|As of September 2013 the U.S. {{military}} <b>is</b> <b>flying</b> out a {{large amount}} of gear instead of using cheaper overland and sea routes, while U.S. officials declined to elaborate on the reasons for their heavy reliance on the more expensive methods of transport.|$|E
25|$|Another hazard that racing pigeons {{encounter}} <b>is</b> <b>flying</b> into objects {{they sometimes}} cannot see, mostly when flying {{at high speeds}} or in darker weather conditions. The most common obstruction are electricity pylons or TV aerials. Pigeon fanciers will often have one of their pigeons return home with wounds or missing feathers from the belly or flanks region.|$|E

25|$|Every spider species {{produces}} the pheromone {{of only one}} specific moth species (or a small set) and is thus dependent on it. However, bolas spiders will try and often succeed to catch any insect that <b>is</b> <b>flying</b> nearby, aided by their good eyesight. They also seem to detect prey {{by the sound of}} their approaching flight.|$|E
25|$|In {{test flights}} the RLG functioned {{exceptionally}} well. the RLG monitors the missile's position in space when it <b>is</b> <b>flying.</b> The missile's on-board computer {{will use this}} information and compare it with the desired position. Based on {{the difference between the}} missile's actual and desired positions, the computer will decide the optimum path and the actuators will command the missile to fly in its desired/targeted position.|$|E
25|$|A clew-first waterstart is a {{variation}} used {{to start in}} the opposite direction from the one the board is initially pointing. It is very similar to a standard waterstart. The main difference is that once the sail <b>is</b> <b>flying,</b> the board is on the mast side of the sailor and points a bit further downwind, on a broad reach. The sail is flipped once the sailor is up and on the board.|$|E

25|$|Christmas Island has a {{population}} of just over 2,000 residents, the majority of whom live in settlements on the northern tip of the island.

Around two-thirds of the island's population are Malaysian Chinese, with significant numbers of Malays and white Australians as well as smaller numbers of Malaysian Indians and Eurasians. Several languages are in use, including English, Malay, and various Chinese dialects, while Buddhism is the primary religion, practised by three-quarters of the population.|$|E
25|$|A bird volant {{faces the}} dexter with its wings spread in flight (usually shown addorsed and elevated) and its legs tucked under its body. Volant En Arrière {{is when the}} bird is shown from a {{top-down}} perspective with the head facing straight ahead, its back to the viewer, and the wings spread in flight (usually shown displayed and inverted). A bird volant is considered in bend ("diagonal") as it <b>is</b> <b>flying</b> from the lower sinister to the upper dexter of the field.|$|E
