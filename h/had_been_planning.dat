5|$|Any large {{project was}} further delayed by the Franco-Prussian War, in which Bartholdi {{served as a}} major of militia. In the war, Napoleon III was {{captured}} and deposed. Bartholdi's home province of Alsace was lost to the Prussians, and a more liberal republic was installed in France. As Bartholdi <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>planning</b> {{a trip to the}} United States, he and Laboulaye decided the time was right to discuss the idea with influential Americans. In June 1871, Bartholdi crossed the Atlantic, with letters of introduction signed by Laboulaye.|$|E
5|$|Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie) {{learns that}} a new life {{insurance}} policy has been taken out in her name, by Josie Packard (Joan Chen) and Benjamin Horne (Richard Beymer). Martell <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>planning</b> with Horne to burn down Packard's sawmill in order to cheaply purchase the land it occupies. Packard speaks to Horne over the telephone, cooperating with the sawmill arson, but arranging to burn it down with Martell inside. As Packard hangs up, it is seen that the recently paroled killer Hank Jennings (Chris Mulkey) has been beside her.|$|E
5|$|In August 1843, {{during a}} break from {{his work on the}} fresco, Etty made what was to prove his final {{overseas}} journey. Since 1839 he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>planning</b> a series of monumental paintings of Joan of Arc, and he wanted to visit places associated with her. Setting out on 16August he spent two weeks touring sites in Rouen, Paris and Orléans associated with her life. Unlike Etty's disastrous prior visits to France, this journey passed without incident, and he found that he actually was coming to enjoy certain aspects of French living.|$|E

5|$|Obrenović {{feared that}} Karađorđe's return would prompt the Ottomans to renege on the {{agreement}} {{reached by the}} Porte and Obrenović's followers in November 1815. By extension, Karađorđe's murder precluded the Serbs of the Pashalik from {{taking part in the}} Balkan-wide rebellion that the Filiki Eteria <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>planning.</b> In Constantinople, Karađorđe's head was impaled on a stake and left on public display for a week. His body was buried on Serbian soil, but his skull ended {{up in the hands of}} a Constantinople museum. It was stolen some years later and buried in Greece.|$|E
5|$|On 22 April 2012, Chen {{escaped from}} house arrest. Chen's fellow activist Hu Jia stated that Chen <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>planning</b> escape {{for a long}} time, and had {{previously}} attempted to dig a tunnel for escape. In {{the weeks leading up}} to his escape, Chen gave his guards the impression that he was ill in bed, and stopped appearing outside the house, which allowed him several days before any absence would be discovered. Under cover of darkness and with the help of his wife, Chen climbed over the wall around his house, breaking his foot in the process.|$|E
5|$|On {{or around}} July 7, King Edward III crossed the English Channel to Normandy with 1,600 ships. He took the ports of La Hogue and Barfleur with {{overwhelming}} force and continued inland towards Caen, taking towns along the way. The French mounted a defence at Caen, but were ultimately defeated. The French <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>planning</b> {{to cross the}} channel and invade England with a force of about 14,000 led by Jean le Franc, but Edward's attack forced them onto the defensive.|$|E

5|$|The Moldavian Prince Ieremia Movilă {{had been}} an old enemy of Michael, having incited Andrew Báthory to send Michael the {{ultimatum}} demanding his abdication. His brother, Simion Movilă, claimed the Wallachian throne for himself and had used the title of Voivode since 1595. Aware of the threat the Movilăs represented, Michael had created the Banate of Buzău and Brăila in July 1598 and the new ban was charged of keeping an alert eye on Moldavian, Tatar and Cossack moves, although Michael <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>planning</b> a Moldavian campaign for several years.|$|E
5|$|François Coli, age 45, a World War I {{veteran and}} {{recipient}} of the French Legion of Honor, had been making record-breaking flights across and around the Mediterranean Sea, and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>planning</b> a transatlantic flight since 1923. His original plans were to fly with his wartime comrade Paul Tarascon, a flying ace with 12 victories from the war. They {{became interested in the}} Orteig Prize in 1925, but in late 1926 an accident destroyed their Potez 25 biplane. Tarascon was badly burned, and relinquished his place as pilot to 35-year-old Charles Nungesser, a highly experienced flying ace with over 40 victories, third highest among the French.|$|E

5|$|Hugh de Lacy died childless around 1115, and Henry I gave Ludlow Castle {{and most}} of the {{surrounding}} estates to Hugh's niece, Sybil, marrying her to Pain fitzJohn, one of his household staff. Pain used Ludlow as his caput, the main castle in his estates, using the surrounding estates and knight's fees to support the castle and its defences. Pain died in 1137 fighting the Welsh, triggering a struggle for the inheritance of the castle. Robert fitzMiles, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>planning</b> to marry Pain's daughter, laid claim to it, as did Gilbert de Lacy, Roger de Lacy's son. By now, King Stephen had seized the English throne, but his position was insecure and he therefore gave Ludlow to fitzMiles in 1137, in exchange for promises of future political support.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, Lemoine co-founded another {{mathematical}} journal entitled, L'intermédiaire des mathématiciens {{along with}} Charles Laisant, a friend {{whom he met}} at the École Polytechnique. Lemoine <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>planning</b> such a journal since early 1893, but thought {{that he would be}} too busy to create it. At a dinner with Laisant in March 1893, he suggested the idea of the journal. Laisant cajoled him to create the journal, and so they approached the publisher Gauthier-Villars, which published the first issue in January 1894. Lemoine served as the journal's first editor, and held the position for several years. The year after the journal's initial publication, he retired from mathematical research, but continued to support the subject. Lemoine died on 21 February 1912 in his home city of Paris.|$|E
5|$|Skanderbeg's {{primary reason}} for allying with Alfonso was his fear of 21-year-old Mehmed II, whose {{ambition}} was to reconquer Justinian I's empire which stretched from Syria to Spain. Mehmed <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>planning</b> a campaign against Albania since Skanderbeg had defeated his father at Krujë in 1450. Another factor was that Krujë geographically dominated Durazzo, which was only 150 kilometers from Brindisi, the nearest Italian port. Mehmed's ambitions were symmetrical to Alfonso's {{and it was clear}} that there would be some sort of clash between the two in Albania, the epicenter of the conflict. Mehmed {{was one of the first}} monarchs since Roman times to keep a massive centralized army under his personal control. Besides controlling a huge army, Mehmed was widely acknowledged for his far-reaching wisdom which allowed him to produce a highly advanced military armed with the newest models of the cannon.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Navy <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>planning</b> an {{operation}} against Isle de France since neutralizing the threats from Cape Town and Java in the Dutch East Indies in 1806, but {{was forced to}} act earlier than expected following the despatch from France of a powerful frigate squadron under Commodore Jacques Hamelin in late 1808. This French force was able to capture a number of East Indiamen and disrupt trade routes across the Indian Ocean by raiding the convoys in which the merchant ships travelled. Forced to confront this enemy, Admiral Albemarle Bertie at the Cape of Good Hope ordered Commodore Josias Rowley to blockade the French islands and prevent their use as raiding bases.|$|E
5|$|Three {{days after}} the accident, series {{organizers}} announced that the race would {{be the subject of}} a full investigation. The other members of the Automobile Competition Committee for the United States (ACCUS), the national governing body of automobile racing in the United States, {{and a member of the}} FIA made their resources available for the investigation, which IndyCar officials expected to take several weeks. As all ACCUS/FIA members participated in the investigation, IndyCar would have full use of the NASCAR R Center in Concord, North Carolina. In the meantime, all testing at Las Vegas Motor Speedway was cancelled indefinitely; Franchitti and Chip Ganassi Racing <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>planning</b> to test the 2012-spec Dallara chassis at the circuit in the week following the race.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his arrival}} in the Mediterranean, Lyster {{proposed}} a carrier airstrike on the Italian fleet at its base in Taranto, as the Royal Navy <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>planning</b> since the Abyssinia Crisis of 1935, and Admiral Andrew Cunningham, commander of the Mediterranean Fleet, approved the idea by 22 September 1940. The attack, with both available carriers, was originally planned for 21 October, {{the anniversary of the}} Battle of Trafalgar, but a hangar fire aboard Illustrious on 18 October forced its postponement until 11 November when the next favourable phase of the moon occurred. The fire destroyed three Swordfish and heavily damaged two others, but they were replaced by aircraft from Eagle, whose contaminated fuel tanks prevented her from participating in the attack.|$|E
