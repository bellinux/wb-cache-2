50|$|Both the internationalized European ECE Regulation 19 and North American SAE {{standard}} J583 permit {{selective yellow}} front fog lamps.

50|$|In 1971 {{a special}} {{model of the}} A1 was {{developed}} in dedication to the Mediterranean Games in İzmir, called the Akdeniz (Mediterranean). Anadol Akdeniz was like a prelude of the new model which arrived in 1972, and had bumpers which were integrated {{to the shape of}} the bodywork, a different front grille, rectangular <b>headlamps</b> with <b>white</b> signal lamps, and different rear lights. The interior of the car was also completely changed, with a new dashboard, new seats and new finishing materials. Starting from 1972, this model became the standard coupé of Anadol until its production was stopped in 1975.|$|R
2500|$|Selective yellow {{headlamps}} remained {{mandatory for}} cars registered in France until January 1993, when <b>white</b> <b>headlamps</b> were authorized for French registered cars, and they rapidly became virtually universal. Nevertheless, selective yellow headlamps remain legal in France, {{as the current}} French regulations stipulates that [...] "every motor vehicle must be equipped, at the front, with two or four lights, creating in a forward direction selective yellow or white light permitting efficient illumination of the road at night for a distance, in clear conditions, of 100 metres".|$|R
2500|$|Headlamps are {{generally}} {{required to produce}} white light, according to both ECE and SAE standards. ECE Regulation 48 currently requires new vehicles to be equipped with <b>headlamps</b> emitting <b>white</b> light. Different <b>headlamp</b> technologies produce different characteristic types of white light; the white specification is quite large and permits {{a wide range of}} apparent color from warm white (with a brown-orange-amber-yellow cast) to cold white (with a blue-violet cast). Previous ECE regulations also permitted selective yellow light, which from 1936 until 1993 was required on all vehicles registered in France. Selective yellow headlamps are no longer common, but are permitted in various countries throughout Europe as well as in non-European locales such as South Korea, [...] Japan and New Zealand. In Iceland, yellow headlamps are allowed and the vehicle regulations in Monaco still officially require selective yellow light from all vehicles' low beam and high beam headlamps, and fog lamps if present.|$|R

50|$|Vehicles {{typically}} include headlamps {{and tail}} lights. <b>Headlamps</b> are <b>white</b> or selective yellow lights {{placed in the}} front of the vehicle, designed to illuminate the upcoming road and to make the vehicle more visible. Many manufactures are turning to LED headlights as an energy-efficient alternative to traditional headlamps. Tail and brake lights are red and emit light to the rear so as to reveal the vehicle's direction of travel to following drivers. White rear-facing reversing lamps indicate that the vehicle's transmission has been placed in the reverse gear, warning anyone behind the vehicle that it is moving backwards, or about to do so. Flashing turn signals on the front, side, and rear of the vehicle indicate an intended change of position or direction. In the late 1950s, some automakers began to use electroluminescent technology to backlight their cars' speedometers and other gauges or to draw attention to logos or other decorative elements.|$|R
