5|$|In 1918, Halifax sent a Christmas tree to the City of Boston in {{thanks and}} remembrance {{for the help}} that the Boston Red Cross and the Massachusetts Public Safety Committee {{provided}} immediately after the disaster. That <b>gift</b> <b>was</b> revived in 1971 by the Lunenburg County Christmas Tree Producers Association, which began an annual donation of a large tree to promote Christmas tree exports as well as acknowledge Boston's support after the explosion. The <b>gift</b> <b>was</b> later {{taken over by the}} Nova Scotia Government to continue the goodwill gesture as well as to promote trade and tourism. The tree is Boston's official Christmas tree and is lit on Boston Common throughout the holiday season. In deference to its symbolic importance for both cities, the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources has specific guidelines for selecting the tree.|$|E
5|$|In July 2010, Booker {{attended}} a {{dinner at a}} conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, where he was seated with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg, who had no known ties to Newark, announced in September 2010 that he was donating $100 million of his personal fortune to the Newark school system. According to an article in the New York Times, Booker and Zuckerberg continued their conversation about Booker's plans for Newark. The initial <b>gift</b> <b>was</b> made to start a foundation for education. The <b>gift</b> <b>was</b> formally announced when Booker, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and Zuckerberg appeared together on The Oprah Winfrey Show. The timing of Zuckerberg's donation was questioned by some as a move for damage control to his image, as it was announced on the opening day of the movie The Social Network, a film that painted an unflattering portrait of Zuckerberg. On her show, however, Winfrey told the audience that Zuckerberg and Booker had been in talks for months and had actually planned the announcement for the previous month, and that she and Booker had to force Zuckerberg to put his name to the donation, which he had wanted to make anonymously.|$|E

The hamlet of Kersal, which now forms part of the City of Salford, was gifted to the Cluniac Priory of Lenton, near Nottingham, in 1142. The most {{important}} part of the <b>gift</b> <b>was</b> the fishing rights on the River Irwell, and even in the 18th century, the salmon rights on the rivers of Lancashire were let every year for many hundreds of pounds.|$|E

5|$|In 1610 the Constable {{gave the}} cup to a convent in Medina de Pomar, near Burgos, as the {{inscription}} describes. His deed of gift survives, and records that the <b>gift</b> <b>was</b> on condition that the cup was never alienated by the convent. A marginal note on the deed, in the Constable's own handwriting, records that he had obtained {{the permission of the}} Archbishop of Toledo, Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas, for {{the cup to}} be used as a ciborium, or container for consecrated hosts. By this period a rule of the church normally forbade the use of vessels decorated on their inner surface as ciboria.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, the First Roumanian-American congregation/Congregation Shaarey Shamoyim {{purchased}} the Rivington Street building from the Church Extension and Missionary Society {{to satisfy a}} need for a larger building to serve the Lower East Side's rapidly growing Romanian-Jewish population. At the time, the property was valued at $95,000 (today $). The funds for the purchase were raised from the members of the congregation, and to honor those contributing $10 or more, names were engraved on one of four marble slabs in the stairway to the main sanctuary. The most generous <b>gift</b> <b>was</b> $500, at a time when $10 was two weeks' pay.

5|$|During William John's absence {{the estate}} was managed by his brother, Canon George Bankes, who {{inherited}} {{it on his}} brother's death just a year before his own in 1857. His youngest grandson Walter Ralph inherited the estate in 1869, and later in life married Henrietta, and had a son Henry John Ralph Bankes. After Walter's death in 1902, his widow undertook the last major developments to the estate, including construction of the church (1907), new entrance lodges (1912â€“13) and numerous estate cottages. In 1923 control passed to Ralph Bankes, the seven times great-grandson of the original creator. During the Second World War an extensive military encampment {{was established in the}} south-east quarter of the park, which was only restored after the National Trust took ownership. Ralph Bankes died in 1981 and the Kingston Lacy estate, including 12 working farms, and Corfe Castle were bequeathed to the National Trust.

5|$|The Pennington {{family owned}} Pennington Hall from about 1200 {{until they were}} {{replaced}} by the Bradshaw or Bradshaighs in 1312. The Bradshaws held the manor until 1703 when John, {{the last of the}} male line died. Pennington Hall was rebuilt in 1748 by the then owner Samuel Hilton and in 1807 sold to the Gaskell family of Thornes, Wakefield, who let it to a succession of tenants. Around 1840 James Pownall, a founder member of the silk manufacturing firm, Bickham and Pownall, was tenant. Later occupants were Charles Jackson, cotton manufacturer, Jabez Johnson, and F.W. Bouth founder of Bouth's Mill in 1862, The last resident was the brewer, George Shaw. On 3 December 1919 George Shaw & Co Ltd offered the hall and grounds to the people of Leigh.

5|$|The manor of St Catherine {{belonged to}} Prior Cantlow of Bath Abbey in medieval times. It takes {{its name from}} the Church of St Catherine beside the manor house. When the house was not {{occupied}} by the monks it was leased. In 1536 the lease was to Thomas Llewellyn who remained as the tenant after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Henry VIII granted the manor to his tailor, John Malte, in 1546. Part of the condition of the <b>gift</b> <b>was</b> that he adopt the kings illegitimate daughter Ethelreda Malte. Ethelreda inherited the house and married John Harington. After Ethelreda's death in 1551 Harrington married again. His son from this marriage was another John Harington who grew up and became a courtier of Elizabeth I and invented the first flush toilet. He {{spent most of his time}} at his principle seat at nearby Kelston and, in 1591, sold St Catherine's Court to John Blanchard. His son William Blanchard, remodelled the house. His initials appear in the plasterwork frieze of a bedroom. The Blanchard family lived at the court for several generations. In 1610 the porch was added and a terraced garden laid out. The house passed by marriage to the Parry family but was not maintained and the fabric of the building was declining by the 18th century, when half of the building was used by a tenant farmer.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} demonstrate how a church can be built {{on the basis of}} spiritual gifts. Every person in a local church who has given his life to Christ has at least one gift to use in building the "Body " of Christ into a living organism. If these <b>gifts</b> <b>are</b> used in love, they will help unify, edify, and strengthen the "Body". If they are not used in love, they will divide and destroy the "Body". The foundation for spiritual <b>gifts</b> <b>is</b> the Bible. The Bible teaches that spiritual <b>gifts</b> <b>were</b> given out of God's grace and love. I point to 25 different gifts that God has given to the "Body " as a whole. No one <b>gift</b> <b>is</b> more important than another, and each gift enables us to do what God has called us to do as his "Body". The <b>gifts</b> <b>are</b> like the tire on a car, and love is the air that makes the tire useful...|$|R
