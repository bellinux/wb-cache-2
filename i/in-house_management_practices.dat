40|$|One {{objective}} {{of government is}} to provide services at least cost whilst maintaining or improving service quality. While this {{may be an important}} objective, questions are being asked whether services can be provided more efficiently and effectively by the private rather than by the government sector. The shift of service provision from the public to the private sector is known as outsourcing or contracting out. The objective in this study is to critically examine whether the contracting out of services by local government to the private sector is an efficient <b>management</b> <b>practice.</b> The contracting out of Parks and Grounds Maintenance services for the City of Kingston in the State of Victoria, Australia, is used as an exploratory case study to identify the variables associated with management decision-making in the contracting out process. Factors relevant to the contracting out decision such as the criteria used in selecting a contractor; the evaluation of a contractor’s performance; and any subsequent changes to <b>management</b> <b>practice</b> relating to the contracting out of the services are identified and discussed. Political forces were found to be an important consideration in the initial contracting out decision, and the selection of a contractor was influenced by the potential to avoid costs. It was also found that under-bidding and associated cost /profit constraints lead to contractors engaging in non-sustainable environmental practices which resulted in the degradation of the local government’s Parks and Gardens assets. A sustainable asset management philosophy as opposed to an avoidable costs approach now underpins the contracting out process to ensure the preservation of such assets. Further, administrative processes have been revised to make tender specifications more prescriptive, critical components of services have been brought back <b>in-house,</b> and <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> have been amended so that a greater degree of control is exercised over contractors’ activities. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Project {{cost control}} {{is one of}} the key <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> that are crucial to the {{survival}} of every construction company in a country. The involvement, good cooperation and good coordination of the contractors' <b>in-house</b> <b>management</b> team roles are essential to achieve maximum good <b>management</b> <b>practice</b> as well as maximum profit. The objectives of the study were to identify the various roles in-house team members play for successful project cost control and to develop a model to show the interdependencies of the roles among the contractor's team for effective cost control. The study uses both quantitative and qualitative approach. The population and sample sizefor this study comprised all registered members of the Ashanti Region branch of Association of Building and Civil Contractors of Ghana (ABCCG) who wereforty-one (41) members in good standing with response rate of 90 %. Likert scale from 'always to never' was used to evaluate the roles of the contractors' team. The survey indicated that the project manager is responsible for checking cost performance, timely co"ective measures and taking plan based on actual cost. The quantity surveyor also prepares detailed estimates, cash flow forecasting, financial reporting, gathers cost data by checking invoices. The store keeper/manager also does inventory control, controlling of materials, and minimizing wastage of materials at construction site. A model developed shows that project manager links up all the professionals by coordination with the contractors' management team to achieve maximum good <b>management</b> <b>practice</b> as well as maximum profit...|$|R
40|$|Improved {{industrial}} {{energy efficiency}} is a cornerstone in climate change mitigation. Research {{results suggest that}} there is still major untapped potential for improved industrial energy efficiency. The major model used to explain the discrepancy between optimal level of energy efficiency and the current level is the barrier model, e. g., different barriers to energy efficiency inhibit adoption of cost-effective measures. The measures outlined in research and policy action plans are almost exclusively technology-oriented, but great potential for energy efficiency improvements is also found in operational measures. Both technology and operational measures are combined in successful energy <b>management</b> <b>practices.</b> Most research in the field of energy management is grounded in engineering science, and theoretical models on how energy management in industry is carried out are scarce. One way to further develop and improve energy management, both theoretically as well as practically, is to explore how a socio-technical perspective can contribute to this understanding. In this article we will further elaborate this potential of cross-pollinating these fields. The aim {{of this paper is to}} relate energy management to two theoretical models, situated action and transaction analysis. We conclude that the current model for energy management systems, the input-output model, is insufficient for understanding <b>in-house</b> industrial energy <b>management</b> <b>practices.</b> By the incorporation of situated action and transaction analysis to the currently used input-output model, an enhanced understanding of the complexity of energy management is gained. It is not possible to find a single energy management solution suitable for any industrial company, but rather the idea is to find a reflexive model that can be adjusted from time to time. An idea for such a reflexive model would contain the structural elements from energy management models with consideration for decisions being situated and impossible to predict...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: No single {{project is}} {{identical}} {{to one another in}} the construction industry. Furthermore, many construction projects are suffering from tighter budget, shortened schedule and higher client satisfaction level. To overcome these, project managers and engineers are willing to apply various best <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> to their projects. However, it is non-trivial to select the most appropriate practices for their projects. In many cases, it is much more important to find the appropriateness of the <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> than just to use the practices.
