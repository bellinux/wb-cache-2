40|$|The {{history of}} {{fermentation}} is strictly linked to vinegar production. Among fermented foods, however, vinegar {{is recognized as}} a poor product; in many cases, the raw materials have higher nutritional values than the nal product. Vinegar is generally used as a food avoring, a preservative and a beverage with healthy properties. Acetic acid has several uses in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, chemical and textile industries, where it is produced via chemical synthesis. Vinegar {{is the product of}} double scalar fermentation, which is performed by yeasts and acetic acid bacteria (AAB) from sources of fermentable carbohydrates, such as apples, pears, <b>grape,</b> <b>honey,</b> sap of plants, cereals and hydrolyzed starch. In addition, distilled ethanol from fermented raw materials can be used to produce vinegar. In the latter case, vinegar is referred to as ‘spirit vinegar’ or ‘white vinegar’; its use is widespread in northern Europe and the Americas. In some countries, vinegar is also produced from acetic acid via wood pyrolysis; however, this practice is less common, as the fermentation of agricultural raw material is a priority for international organizations, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Union (EU) and countries that engage in sustainable production...|$|E

6000|$|The goddess, in wrath at this outrage, attired {{herself in}} black {{mourning}} raiment, and withdrew into a cave, {{according to the}} Phigalians, and {{the fruits of the}} earth perished. Zeus learned from Pan the place of Demeter's retreat, and sent to her the Moeræ or Fates, who persuaded her to abate her anger. The cave became her holy place, and there was set an early wooden xoanon, or idol, representing the goddess {{in the shape of a}} woman with the head and mane of a mare, in memory of her involuntary intrigue in that shape. Serpents and other creatures were twined about her head, and in one hand, for a mystic reason undivulged, she held a dolphin, in the other a dove. The wooden image was destroyed by fire, and disasters fell on the Phigalians. Onatas was then employed to make a bronze statue like the old idol, wherof the fashion was revealed to him in a dream.

Albania's proximity to the Ionian Sea and the Adriatic Sea give the underdeveloped fishing industry great potential.

40|$|The {{story of}} {{microbial}} biotransformation is {{closely associated with}} vinegar production, which dates back to around 2000 years BC. However, among fermented foods, vinegar has been always considered a “poor” component: {{it is not a}} “food”, it doesn’t have high nutritional values, and it is produced by transformation of other more nutritive rich fermented foods. Vinegar is a condiment, but also a preservative and, in some countries, a healthy drink. It can be made by a two step fermentation of yeasts followed by acetic acid bacteria from almost any fermentable carbohydrate source: apples, pears, <b>grapes,</b> <b>honey,</b> syrups, cereals, hydrolysed starches, beer, and wine are all ideal substrates for the production of vinegar. Since vinegars is, with few exceptions, an inexpensive commodity, its production requires a low-cost raw material, such as sub-standard fruits, seasonal agricultural surpluses, various food processing by-products and fruit waste. However there are vinegars, so called spirit vinegars, obtained directly by acetic oxidation of alcohol obtained from distillation of fermented mashes or, in some countries, petrolchemical ethanol. Some western by-products of wood carbonization obtained by distillation of pyroligneous liquor collected during wood pyrolisis, are called “vinegar” and they are used as agricultural material, animal health product, cosmetic ingredients and folk drug in Japan and Est-Asia (Mu et al., 2003; Mu et al., 2006). These distilled solutions have not be considered as vinegar because no fermentative process occurs in their production. Other specialty vinegars are grouped as herbal or fruit vinegars. In this cases the name “X vinegar” doesn’t indicate the raw materials used in vinegar fermentation but the flavours added to obtain specific taste and characteristic sensorial features. Herbal vinegars consist of wine vinegars or white distilled vinegars, which may be seasoned with garlic, basil, tarragon, cinnamon, clove, or nutmeg. Fruit-flavoured vinegars are wine and white vinegars sweetened with fruit or fruit juice to produce a characteristic sweet-sour taste. Traditional vinegars are very expensive vinegar produced from regional foods according to well-established customs: balsamic vinegar of Modena from Italy; Sherry vinegar from Spain; Champagne vinegar from France etc. According to international definition of vinegar, in this book we considered only vinegar derived from a two stage fermentation process. However with many of the vinegars in Africa, Asia and Latin America, knowledge of the processes involved is poor and a comprehensive view of all different kinds of vinegars is impossible. Therefore {{it is likely that the}} worldspread vinegars give a very greater picture. Economy, technology and law about vinegar were described in this chapter...|$|R
5000|$|Wine in Rome did {{not become}} common or mass-produced until around 250 B.C. It was more {{commonly}} produced {{around the time of}} Cato the Elder who mentions in his book De Agri Cultura that the vineyard was {{the most important aspect of}} a good farm. Wine was considered a staple drink, consumed at all meals and occasions by all classes and was quite cheap; however, it was always mixed with water. This was the case even during explicit evening drinking events (comissatio) where an important part of the festivity was choosing an arbiter bibendi (Judge of Drinking) who was, among other things, responsible for deciding the ratio of wine to water in the drinking wine. Wine to water ratios of 1:2, 1:3, or 1:4 were commonly used. Many types of drinks involving <b>grapes</b> and <b>honey</b> were consumed as well. Mulsum was honeyed wine, mustum was grape juice, mulsa was honeyed water. The per-person-consumption of wine per day in the city of Rome has been estimated at 0.8 to 1.1 gallons for males, and about 0.5 gallons for females. Even the notoriously strict Cato the Elder recommended distributing a daily ration of low quality wine of more than 0.5 gallons among the slaves forced to work on farms.|$|R

Fruit was also processed for later use in a variety of ways: Fruit with high sugar content was fermented to make alcoholic beverages; grapes were most commonly used for this. Fruit was also boiled down into thick, sweet syrup, referred to in the Bible as dvash (<b>honey).</b> <b>Grapes,</b> figs, dates and apricots were also dried and preserved individually or put on a string or pressed into cakes.

Researchers hypothesize that this hybrid beverage (a beer, wine, and mead combination) was fermented by the process of mold saccharification, a uniquely Chinese contribution to the art of beverage-making in which several mold species are used to break down the carbohydrates of rice and other grains into simple, fermentable sugars. Specific aromatic herbs and flowers such as chrysanthemum, in addition to tree resins such as China fir, had been added to the hybrid beverages, the researchers found. These aromatic additions, as well as the honey, indicate that fermented beverages with a pleasing aroma and sweet taste were important to the Jiahu people.|$|R
