40|$|Species of the Botanophila helviana species {{group are}} small, blackish anthomyiids known from {{temperate}} to subarctic (northern/elevated) {{parts of the}} Holarctic Region. Adult flies are anthophilous, obtaining pollen and nectar from various flowering plants. Preliminary {{evidence suggests that the}} larvae may attack developing seed heads of Ranunculus (Ranunculaceae). The male and female terminalia are very characteristic and support the monophyly of the species group. Further evidence for this is provided by the peculiar structure of their prestomal teeth. A taxonomic revision of the European species with illustrated descriptions and an identification key to males and females is given. The following six species are treated: Botanophila helviana Michelsen, 1983, B. kitadakeana Suwa, 1998 and the new species B. minuta (Norway, Sweden), B. nigra (Norway, Finland and Sweden), B. peristeriensis (<b>Greece)</b> <b>and</b> <b>B.</b> saliciphila (Spain) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} deaf {{education}} worldwide has mainly {{focused on the}} oral versus sign language debate. Only minor {{attention has been paid}} to the historical context and background in which educational ideasand methods for teaching deaf children developed. Significant historical information about deaf educationin Greece and in Cyprus began relatively late with the founding of the first schools for the deaf in thetwentieth century. This paper will provide a comparative examination of the history of deaf education inGreece and in Cyprus by highlighting the most important events that have contributed to the developmentof the education of deaf people in both countries. Data for this paper were drawn from “official” sources(written documents), as well as from interviews with informants (teachers, parents, and deaf people) ofGreece and Cyprus. The study has revealed that the history of deaf education in both countries has beeneventful, and it has developed through major shortcomings and debates. Despite the fact that Greece andCyprus are in close geographical proximity and the fact that their educational policies on various issuesare quite similar, the main findings of this study show that a number of factors have led to the developmentof different provisions for deaf children in these two countries. Specifically, parents' lobbying, DeafCommunity empowerment, various legal measures, available technology, and teachers' training backgroundsseem to be the major contributing factors for the establishment of a) bilingual education, andspecial units and schools for the deaf in <b>Greece</b> <b>and</b> <b>b)</b> oral education and inclusion in Cyprus...|$|E
40|$|Background Several {{studies suggest}} that {{socioeconomic}} status affects (SES) affects self-rated health (SRH), both in Greece and internationally. However, prior research mainly uses objective measures of SES, instead of subjective evaluations of individuals’ social status. Based on this, this paper aims to examine (a) {{the impact of the}} economic dowturn on SRH in <b>Greece</b> <b>and</b> (<b>b)</b> the relationship between subjective social status (SSS), social network and SRH. Methods The descriptive analysis is based on four cross-sectional surveys conducted by the National School of Public Health, Athens, Greece (2002, 2006, 2011, 2015), while the data for the empirical investigation were derived from the 2015 survey (Health[*]+[*]Welfare Survey GR). The empirical strategy is based on an ordinal logistic regression model, aiming to examine how several variables affect SRH. Size of social network and SSS are among the independent variables employed for the empirical analysis Results According to our findings, average SRH has deteriorated, and the percentage of the population that reports very good/good SRH has also decreased. Moreover, our empirical analysis suggests that age, existence of a chronic disease, size of social network and SSS affect SRH in Greece. Conclusion Our findings are consistent with the existing literature and confirm a social gradient in health. According to our analysis, health disparities can be largely attributed to socioeconomic inequalities. The adverse economic climate has impact on socioeconomic differences which in turn affect health disparities. Based on these, policy initiatives are necessasy in order to mitigate the negative impact on health and the disparities caused by economic dowturn and the occuring socioeconomic inequalities...|$|E

40|$|Lignite (brown coal) is Greece's most {{important}} energy mineral raw material. Lignite exploitation {{has made a}} highly {{significant contribution to the}} development of energy sector of Greece on past 50 years, and will, according to estimations, continue to supply energy for another 40 years. Greece is very rich in Lignite resources. The two main basins - from where Lignite is extracted by opencast mining - are a) in Western Macedonia (northen Greece) where is generated the 70 % of the whole electricity of <b>Greece</b> <b>and</b> <b>b)</b> in Central Peloponese (Southern Greece) where is generated the 10 % of the whole electricity of Greece. In this respect, Public Power Corporation of Greece cooperates with the local administrative authorities and finances or undertakes social "compensation" projects for life improvement, and social and financial support of the residential areas near mines. Also provides technical services and contributes to the carrying out of small projects in municipalities and communities. Finaly provides thermal energy from the power stations for the district teleheating of the towns of Kozani, Ptolemais and Megalopolis and surrounting settlements. In addition to the works of social regeneration and the duty for the development of industrial areas, for the redevelopment works and environmental protection of the new ground at the lignite mines, more than 500. 000 Euros are spent on a yearly basis (350. 000 Euros at West Macedonia and 150. 000 Euros at Central Peloponese). Moreover, according to data taken from the statement of accounts regarding only the operation of the mines (salaries, commossions, contracts assigned etc) the amount of 367. 000. 000 Euros is spent in the local societies of Kozani and Florina Prefectures. As a result, Lignite contributes to the regional Development of the country. Lignite mining and the generation of electric power take place in less developed areas, ensuring employment for a large number of scientific and labor personel, reducing unemployment and urban attraction and increasing the per capita local income in these areas. ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{critically}} {{examines the}} generation of discourses on Greek identity following an episode {{that took place in}} northern Greece (2000 / 2003) when an Albanian student was elected flag-carrier in a commemorative parade. Three versions of Greek identity emerged in this context: the first was based on civic understandings of identity, promoting the current Europeanist project of citizenship as belonging. The second version drew upon the notion of “culture” as an all-encompassing concept to promote ideas of Greek cultural “purity” that have roots in Greek ethnogenesis. The third version adopted an understanding of the “nation” in terms of racial affiliation, transforming it thus into a natural category. The argument put forward is that {{in the context of the}} 2000 / 2003 episode (a) Greek self-perceptions are affected by the problematic economic and cultural position of <b>Greece</b> within Europe <b>and</b> (<b>b)</b> Greek discourses of identity are a form of resistance to processes of Europeanization that threaten traditional “imagined communities” embedded in history...|$|R
