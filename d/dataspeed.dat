5000|$|The Teletype <b>Dataspeed</b> 40 {{combined}} electronic CRTs {{and high}} speed printer terminals and were networked {{in many different}} applications {{through the use of}} [...] "cluster controllers" [...] and digital data service units. The <b>Dataspeed</b> 40 interfaced a synchronous modem usually running at 2400, 4800 or 9600 baud. The trademarked term [...] "Dataspeed" [...] originated with a series of high speed paper tape terminals that sent and received oil-treated punched paper tape at 1050 words per minute. AT&T used the <b>Dataspeed</b> 40 terminals internally for their Switching Control Center System and similar purposes. The <b>Dataspeed</b> 40 was also sold commercially and used for a variety of purposes and displaced some older and slower speed Teletype equipment.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dataspeed</b> was the Bell System {{name for}} a family of high speed paper tape systems used with DataPhone modems. Type 1was 5-level, 1050 wpm. Type 2 was 5-8 level, 1050 wpm. Type 4 was 8 level with {{automatic}} error detection and correctionby retransmitting blocks of data received in error. Type 5 was 8 level 750 wpm using a modem that was very inexpensiveas a transmitter; hence the system was popular for data collection applications.|$|E
50|$|The lead traded amongst Mears, Sneva, Mario Andretti, Teo Fabi, and Danny Ongais. After {{the lengthy}} caution for Bedard's crash, Tom Sneva {{came to the}} lead, and led at the halfway point. Around lap 70, the <b>DataSpeed</b> {{computer}} timing and scoring system crashed. The remainder of the race {{would have to be}} scored manually, and the scoring serials were at times incomplete. However, at no point was the leader of the race unknown or disputed.|$|E
50|$|In 1981 Lockton {{moved from}} Los Angeles to Silicon Valley to apply his {{experience}} at California Business with subscription based financial information {{and at the}} Ontario Motor Speedway with the wireless technology behind the real-time timing and scoring system, to stock market trading information. He purchased a controlling interest in Data Broadcasting (originally <b>Dataspeed,</b> a company that had developed a pc version of the Ontario wireless real time scoring system) where he invented the hand held wireless QuoTrek, the first product to utilize “push” technology and wireless data, to deliver real time stock and commodity trading information to paying subscribers in a mobile environment. He successfully petitioned United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to deregulate and {{permit the use of}} the analog sub-carrier (FCC Docket 82-536) for the real time broadcast of digital data. He successfully negotiated with the Boards of Governors of the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ, and Amex exchanges as well as the Chicago Board of Trade and Commodities Exchange Center to create a low cost “non professional” fee structure for their real time trading information, thereby pioneering a consumer market for real time stock and futures trading. The first nationwide real time wireless data network he created supported the QuoTrek and Signal services which won numerous awards. With the QuoTrek’s companion invention, Signal, a wireless modem linked to a PC and Lotus 1-2-3 software to manage multiple investment accounts, the services generated over $1.3 billion in revenues over their product lives. George Guilder credited the QuoTrek in Life After Television (Norton 1992, pp 66-67) as the invention which created the communications paradigm known as “push” or “always on” data. Guilder predicted a revolution in the way time sensitive data would be delivered which is now pervasive on the Web and Cellular 3G networks. In 1984 Lockton designed and developed the prototype of a multi-purpose hand held device, the Informa, with a backlit LCD screen and alpha/numeric keyboard, designed to use the nationwide real time wireless data network of FM radio stations Lockton had assembled. In addition to user specified stocks and commodities quotes, news, weather and sports information in real time, the user could send wireless email and messages via a built in phone modem instantly received by the addressee wherever they were. The Informa concept preceded the Web by nine years, real-time wireless messaging by several years and the data capabilities of the 2G cellular networks by 10 years. In 1985 Data Broadcasting was sold to Lotus Development Corporation which never introduced the Informa.|$|E
40|$|Data {{transfer}} speed on GPRS 2 ̆ 7 s technology isaffected {{by the present}} of some obstacles between sender 2 ̆ 7 s side and recipient 2 ̆ 7 s side. Those obstacles cause propagation loss that affect the reduction of power level value (rx level). The reduction will affect the data speed. The lower rx level 2 ̆ 7 s value means the lower <b>dataspeed.</b> This researchwas done by doing drive test on BTS North Purwokerto and BTS Tambaksogra to measure the amount of power measured (Pr) andthe download data speed on GPRS 2 ̆ 7 s network. The measuredpower level (Pr) was normalized to get rx level value. Regression analysis was done to get {{the relation between the}} download speed and the rx level value. Theanalysis has resulted in a model: download speed = 4. 1 (rx level) 0. 459, with R^ 2 = 0. 380. Correlation analysis shows high correlationbetween rx level and download speed (r = 0. 608) ...|$|E
