2500|$|Because the ILOs {{enforcement}} and sanction mechanisms are weak, {{there has been}} significant discussion about incorporating labour standards in the World Trade Organisation's operation, since its formation in 1994. The WTO oversees, primarily, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which is a treaty aimed at reducing customs, tariffs and other barriers to free import and export of goods, services and capital between its 157 member countries. Unlike for the ILO, if the WTO rules on trade are contravened, member states who secure a judgment by the Dispute Settlement procedures (effectively a judicial process) may retaliate through trade sanctions. This could include reimposition of targeted tariffs against the non-compliant country. Proponents of an integrated approach {{have called for a}} [...] "social clause" [...] to be inserted into the GATT agreements, for example by amending article XX, which gives an exception to the general trade barrier reduction rules allowing imposition of sanctions for breaches of human rights. An explicit reference to core labour standards could allow action where a WTO member state is found to be in breach of ILO standards. Opponents argue that such an approach could backfire and undermine labour rights, as a country's industries, and therefore its workforce, are necessarily harmed but without any guarantee that labour reform would take place. Furthermore, it was argued in the Singapore Ministerial Declaration 1996 that [...] "the comparative advantage of countries, particularly low-age developing countries, must in no way be put into question." [...] On this view, countries {{ought to be able to}} take advantage of low wages and poor conditions at work as a comparative advantage in order to boost their exports. It is disputed that business will relocate production to low wage countries from higher wage countries such as the UK, because that choice is said to depend on productivity of workers. However, the view of many labour lawyers and economists remains that more trade, when workers have weaker bargaining power and less mobility, still allows business to opportunistically take advantage of workers by moving production, and that a coordinated multilateral approach with targeted measures against specific exports is preferable. While the WTO has yet to incorporate labour rights into its procedures for dispute settlements, many countries began to make bilateral agreements that protected core labour standards instead. Moreover, in <b>domestic</b> <b>tariff</b> regulations not yet touched by the WTO agreements, countries have given preference to other countries who do respect core labour rights, for example under the EU Tariff Preference Regulation, articles 7 and 8.|$|E

40|$|This paper uses firm-level {{data from}} the T 2 /LEAP to {{investigate}} whether the link between tariff changes and employment differed across firms with various productivity and leverage characteristics over the period 1988 to 1994. The {{results suggest that the}} combined effect of domestic and U. S. tariff reductions on employment was typically small, but that losses were significantly larger for firms which were less productive. For instance, firms with average productivity in 1988 responded to tariff changes by cutting employment by only 3. 6 % over the period 1988 to 1994, while lower productivity firms typically shed 15. 1 % of their workforce over the same period. This paper also indicates that firms which were more heavily in debt downsized more in response to declining <b>domestic</b> <b>tariffs,</b> suggesting that financial constrains became more binding when tariff cuts were implemented. These results suggest that firms with high productivity and low leverage were less likely than others to feel the impact of declining U.

40|$|Worldwide the {{electricity}} industry {{is undergoing a}} substantial process of restructuring. The most significant aspect {{of this process is}} the introduction of competition in the production sector. The principal objective is cost reduction, which should eventually lead to lower electricity prices. In the United States bulk power markets, that is, markets involving transactions between producers and distributors, have been open since the beginning of 1997. Hydro-Québec believes that this opening represents an opportunity for it to increase its sales in the northeastern US. This belief is based in large part on the considerable differences between electricity prices in the latter market and in Quebec. In this paper we outline two factors which we believe will limit profitable exports of electricity by Hydro-Québec. The first is the fact that transmission on Hydro-Québec's grid must now be priced at the average system cost. The second is the fact that Hydro-Québec's <b>domestic</b> <b>tariffs</b> continue to be pegged to the average cost of production which is lower than the system marginal cost. This implicitly encourages domestic consumption rather than exports. Both of these factors illustrate the importance of correct price signals for efficient resource allocation. ...|$|R
