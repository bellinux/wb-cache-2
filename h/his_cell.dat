40|$|Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) /Cockayne {{syndrome}} (CS) {{complex is}} a combination of clinical features of two rare genetic disorders in one individual. A sun-sensitive boy (XP 20 BE) who had severe symptoms of CS, with dwarfism, microcephaly, retinal degeneration, and mental impairment, had XP-type pigmentation and died at 6 y with marked cachexia (weight 14. 5 lb) without skin cancers. We evaluate <b>his</b> cultures <b>cells</b> for characteristics CS or XP DNA-repair abnormalities. The level of ultraviolet (UV) -induced unscheduled DNA synthesis was less than 5 % of normal, characteristic of the excision-repair defect of XP. Cell fusion studies indicated that <b>his</b> <b>cells</b> were in XP complementation group G. <b>His</b> <b>cells</b> were hypersensitive to killing by UV, and their post-UV recovery of RNA synthesis was abnormally low, features of both CS and XP. Post-UV survival of plasmid pSP 189 in <b>his</b> <b>cells</b> was markedly reduced, and post-UV plasmid mutation frequency was higher than with normal cells, as in both CS and XP. Sequence analysis of the mutated plasmid marker gene showed normal frequency of plasmids with multiple base substitutions, as in CS, and an abnormally increased frequency of G:C → A:T mutations, a feature of XP. Transfection of UV-treated o/RSV cat with or without photoreactivation revealed that <b>his</b> <b>cells,</b> like XP cells, could not repair either cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers or non-dimer photoproducts. These results indicate that the DNA-repair features of the XP 20 BE (XP-G/CS) cells are phenotypically more like XP than CS cells, whereas clinically the CS phenotype is more prominent that XP...|$|R

5|$|Fischer {{lived for}} a time in Japan. On July 13, 2004, acting in {{response}} to a letter from U.S. officials, Japanese immigration authorities arrested him at Narita International Airport near Tokyo for allegedly using a revoked U.S. passport while trying to board a Japan Airlines flight to Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila, Philippines. Fischer resisted arrest, and claimed to have sustained bruises, cuts and a broken tooth in the process. At the time, Fischer had a passport (originally issued in 1997 and updated in 2003 to add more pages) that, according to U.S. officials, had been revoked in November 2003 due to his outstanding arrest-warrant for the Yugoslavia sanctions violation. Despite the outstanding arrest-warrant in the U.S., Fischer said that he believed the passport was still valid. The authorities held Fischer at a custody center for 16 days before transferring him to another facility. Fischer claimed that <b>his</b> <b>cell</b> was windowless and he had not seen the light of day during that period, and that the staff had ignored his complaints about constant tobacco smoke in <b>his</b> <b>cell.</b>|$|E

5|$|On {{his arrival}} in Nuremberg, Hess was {{reluctant}} {{to give up some}} of his possessions, including samples of food he said had been poisoned by the British; he proposed to use these for his defence during the trial. The commandant of the facility, Colonel Burton C. Andrus of the United States Army, advised him that he would be allowed no special treatment; the samples were sealed and confiscated. Hess's diaries indicate that he did not acknowledge the validity of the court and felt the outcome was a foregone conclusion. He was thin when he arrived, weighing , and had a poor appetite, but was deemed to be in good health. As one defendant, Robert Ley, had managed to hang himself in <b>his</b> <b>cell</b> on 24 October, the remaining prisoners were monitored around the clock.

5000|$|Long ago, Cybertron was peaceful, {{until the}} evil Decepticons waged {{war against the}} Autobots. Both sides fought {{for control of the}} planet, each ruling one half. Eventually, a mysterious, unclarified [...] "cataclysm" [...] struck the planet, {{following}} which the small race of robots known as the Mini-Cons emerged. It would later be discovered that the Mini-Cons were creations of Unicron - currently orbiting Cybertron in a weakened state, disguised as a moon - who had implanted <b>his</b> <b>cells</b> within Cybertron, where they grew and hatched into the Mini-Cons; presumably, then, the cataclysm was caused by Unicron's implantation of <b>his</b> <b>cells.</b> The larger Transformers on Cybertron soon discovered that the Mini-Cons possessed power-enhancing abilities, and began to war over the small robots (it is unclear if the Autobots and Decepticons were already at war, or if it was the emergence of the Mini-Cons which began the conflict).|$|R

5|$|Anna Beauchamp {{joined her}} husband in <b>his</b> <b>cell</b> in the dungeon; the only entry was through a trap door {{at the top of}} the room.

5|$|Carol Park {{went missing}} on 17 July 1976, {{and was never}} seen alive again by her family.
