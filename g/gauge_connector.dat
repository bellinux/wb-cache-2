500|$|During {{the late}} 19th century, the {{corridor}} of modern Route 14 {{was also in}} use by the Southern Pacific Railroad for two lines. The first is a line to connect Los Angeles with the Central Valley, via Tehachapi Pass. While significantly longer than the more direct Ridge Route (east of modern Interstate 5), Tehachapi Pass is lower than Tejon Pass along the Ridge Route, with a longer, less steep grade on the descent into the Central Valley. This rail line remains the primary rail line to connect southern and northern California in use today, now {{owned and operated by}} the Union Pacific Railroad. The second resulted when the Southern Pacific acquired the un-finished Carson and Colorado Railroad in 1900. [...] The Southern Pacific built a standard <b>gauge</b> <b>connector</b> to the narrow gauge Carson and Colorado line from their main at Mojave. Although plans were to eventually convert this acquired line to standard gauge, most of the line was abandoned before the conversion was complete. However, the southern portion of this line is still active and used for connections to the Trona Railway.|$|E
50|$|The more {{expensive}} calibration kits will usually include a torque wrench to tighten connectors properly and a <b>connector</b> <b>gauge</b> to ensure {{there are no}} gross errors in the connectors.|$|R
5000|$|Gage the {{connectors}} {{to determine}} {{there are not}} any gross mechanical problems. <b>Connector</b> <b>gauges</b> with resolutions of 0.001" [...] to 0.0001" [...] will usually {{be included in the}} better quality calibration kits.|$|R
5000|$|The Association of Operative Registered Nurses (AORN) {{recommends}} that the tourniquet cuff, tubing, <b>connectors,</b> <b>gauges,</b> and pressure source {{should be kept}} clean and in working order. [...] Some modern tourniquet systems are capable of testing these items in 30 seconds.|$|R
50|$|On August 8th 1885, {{five years}} after a narrow <b>gauge</b> {{railroad}} <b>connector</b> between New Richmond and Newtown was built by the Cincinnati and Eastern Railway, a trestle collapse occurred {{in front of the}} Gaskin-Malany Farmstead (Three Forks). The trestle crossed the creeks connecting the hill to the northwest, where a station for Locust Corner passengers existed, to the hill to the south. The injured and dying were placed on the stone porch. The Cincinnati and Eastern Connector ceased operation after this.|$|R
