40|$|The {{bootstrap}} Glivenko-Cantelli and bootstrap Donsker theorems of Giné and Zinn (1990) contain both {{necessary and}} sufficient {{conditions for the}} asymptotic validity of Efron’s nonparametric bootstrap. In the more general case of exchangeably weighted bootstraps, Praestgaard and Wellner (1993) and Van der Vaart and Wellner (1996) give analogues of the sufficiency half of the Theorems of Giné and Zinn (1990), but {{did not address the}} corresponding necessity parts of the theorems. Here we establish a new lower bound for exchangeably weighted processes and show that the necessity half of the a. s. bootstrap Glivenko-Cantelli theorem holds for exchangeably weighted bootstraps. We also make some progress toward the conjectured necessity parts of the bootstrap Donsker theorems with <b>exchangeable</b> <b>weights...</b>|$|R
40|$|The cluster {{bootstrap}} resamples clusters or subjects {{instead of}} individual observations {{in order to}} preserve the dependence within each cluster or subject. In this paper, we provide a theoretical justification of using the cluster bootstrap for the inferences of the generalized estimating equations (GEE) for clustered/longitudinal data. Under the general <b>exchangeable</b> bootstrap <b>weights,</b> we show that the cluster bootstrap yields a consistent approximation of the distribution of the regression estimate, and a consistent approximation of the confidence sets. We also show that a computationally more efficient one-step version of the cluster bootstrap provides asymptotically equivalent inference. © 2012...|$|R

40|$|Consider M-estimation in a semiparametric {{model that}} is {{characterized}} by a Euclidean parameter of interest and a nuisance function parameter. We show that, under general conditions, the bootstrap is asymptotically consistent in estimating the distribution of the M-estimate of Euclidean parameter; that is, the bootstrap distribution asymptotically imitates the distribution of the M-estimate. We also show that the bootstrap confidence set has the asymptotically correct coverage probability. These general conclusions hold, in particular, when the nuisance parameter is not estimable at root-n rate. Our results provide a theoretical justification for the use of bootstrap as an inference tool in semiparametric modelling and apply to a broad class of bootstrap methods with <b>exchangeable</b> bootstrap <b>weights.</b> A by-product of our theoretical development is the second order asymptotic linear expansion of the (bootstrap) M-estimate. 1.

40|$|The {{bootstrap}} variance {{estimate is}} widely used in semiparametric inferences. However, its theoretical validity is a well known open problem. In this paper, we provide a first theoretical study on the bootstrap moment estimates in semiparametric models. Specifically, we establish the bootstrap moment consistency of the Euclidean parameter which immediately implies the consistency of t-type bootstrap confidence set. It is worth {{pointing out that the}} only additional cost to achieve the bootstrap moment consistency in contrast with the distribution consistency is to simply strengthen the L_ 1 maximal inequality condition required in the latter to the L_p maximal inequality condition for p≥ 1. The general L_p multiplier inequality developed in this paper is also of independent interest. These general conclusions hold for the bootstrap methods with <b>exchangeable</b> bootstrap <b>weights,</b> e. g., nonparametric bootstrap and Bayesian bootstrap. Our general theory is illustrated in the celebrated Cox regression model. Comment: 25 pages. Some simulation results are added. To appear in Scandinavian Journal of Statistic...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays mouthguards are {{commonly}} used {{in a lot of}} sports for orofacial protection. The benefits of custom-made mouthguards have been tested and successfully approved numerous times. However, no consensus exists regarding the best mouthguard material, the optimal thickness or which combinations of materials offer the best protection. In this in vitro study the protective qualities of five different mouthguard types were examined during small hard object collisions. The aim was to investigate inconclusive aspects of hard inserts, nylon nets and air spaces as reinforcements in the anterior region and the protection qualities of EVA. For the fabrication of the athletic mouthguards different materials by Scheu-Dental (Iserlohn) were used: ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) (BIOPLAST: Young´s modulus 15 MPa, XTREME PRO: 15 – 25 MPa), polyethylene terephthalate glycol-modified (PETG) (DURAN: 2200 MPa) and a nylon mesh. An air space between a layer of mouthguard material and the teeth was also incorporated. Five different mouthguard types with labial thicknesses of 2 – 11 mm (original foil thicknesses added) and of different levels of rigidness were tested and compared to a series of experiments without a mouthguard. A pendulum testing device with (0. 340 kg) or without (0. 205 kg) <b>exchangeable</b> <b>weights</b> and variable deflection (20 °– 120 °) was used to induce different impact energies on a specially designed jaw model, in which a test tooth was incorporated. The induced energy (0. 07 – 2. 85 joule) varied depending on the weight and deflection of the pendulum. The test tooth was pivot-mounted having an axis of rotation and the resistance of the natural tooth was simulated using a tension spring (11. 25 N/mm, Gutekunst + Co. KG). Using an acceleration sensor (ACCELEROMETER, ICP, SHOCK, model Number 350 A 14) the braking accelerations of the strikes on the test tooth or the different mouthguards were measured. A laser vibrometer (Polytec OFV 050 OPTICAL SCANNING HEAD and Polytec OFV 3000 CONTROLLERS VIBROMETER) measured the tooth deflection. Afterwards these tooth deflections were converted to the area of the limbus alveolaris. Every mouthguard type was fabricated three times and each single situation (varying pendulum deflection with and without extra weight on the pendulum) was tested five times respectively with each mouthguard. For the statistic evaluation of the measurement results the program IBM SPSS Statistics 22 was used. The significance level was fixed at p 1. 9 joules) the energy distribution due to rigid mouthguard materials such as DURAN seems to be more important for a good mouthguard-protection than the energy absorption due to softer materials such as BIOPLAST (EVA). The experimental design used allowed the comparative assessments of the protective effect of different mouthguard types for the impact energies tested. However, results of in vitro studies are only limitedly comparable to clinical situations. In the present study the best protective properties were achieved by combining a high labial thickness, an air space in the anterior region, a harder reinforcement (DURAN, XTREME PRO) in the anterior region and softer EVA (BIOPLAST). Even with increasing impact energy, the protective effect was hardly reduced. Which of the factors (layer thickness, hardness of the material, inclusion of air space, position of labial inserts) was ultimately the most decisive, or whether the combination of all factors led to the significantly better protection of the mouthguard Air Space/DURAN over the other mouthguards tested should be investigated in further studies...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the effect of slurry composting and biofiltration (SCB) liquid manure application on shoot growth, fruit qualities and soil chemical properties in peach orchard. SCB liquid manure was fertigated ten times from April to October in SCB plot, whereas chemical fertilizer was treated two times as basal and additional fertilizers in control plot. The shoot growth, leaf nitrogen and potassium content, soil <b>exchangeable</b> K, fruit <b>weight</b> and yield were higher in SCB plot than in control. Soluble solid content and acidity, soil organic matter, soil available phosphate and soil exchangeable Mg showed {{no significant difference between}} treatments, and the leaf calcium and magnesium content were lower in SCB plot than in control. In conclusion, fertigating SCB liquid manure in peach orchard has positive effects on fruit weight and yield, and it is suggested that periodical soil testing is needed because of the possibility of K accumulation in SCB liquid manure treated soil when the orchard is fertigated based on the soil nitrogen content...|$|R
40|$|Cadmium (Cd) uptake by lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) was {{studied in}} a hydroponic {{solution}} study at concentrations approaching the total concentration in contaminated soil solutions. Four cultivars of lettuce were tested (Divina, Reine de Mai, Melina, and J. 44). Ten 12 -day old seedlings, pretreated in 0. 5 mu M CdCl 2 solution, were labelled with carrier free (109) CdCl 2 (from 0. 05 mu M to 5 mu M Cd in nutrient solution) {{in the presence}} and absence of metabolic inhibitors, DNP and DCCD. Cadmium {{taken up by the}} roots was determined after a 30 min desorption in unlabelled CdCl 2 solution. In the absence of metabolic inhibitors and at 5 mu M Cd, root absorbed from 2. 5 to 8 mg Cd/g root dry <b>weight.</b> <b>Exchangeable</b> Cd measured after desorption represented less than 1 % of the total Cd absorbed by the root. Cadmium absorption in presence of DNP showed that approximately 80 % of the Cd enters the cell through an active process. This mechanism seems to be directly associated with H+-ATPase as observed with DCCD inhibition. Varietal differences in shoot Cd uptake were only demonstrated at concentrations below 0. 1 mu M Screening lettuce cultivars only by the Cd level in the tissue seems not to be possible for these cultivars except at concentrations close to that in the soil solution. But differences in relative contribution of uptake mechanisms in total Cd absorption were observed. High levels of Cd in roots were correlated with high contri- butions from H+-ATPase in the active process of Cd uptake...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} zinc on the {{indigenous}} nematode fauna of a sandy soil was determined in an experimentally contaminated outdoor field plot. The {{aims of the}} study were to describe and quantify the changes in density of separate nematode taxa and total nematodes, and the changes in the number of taxa, species diversity, community maturation, and species composition in response to zinc exposure with time, and to compare the observed responses with benchmark concentrations for soil as derived from the species sensitivity distribution (SSD) for zinc toxicity. Speciation of zinc in pore water was considered and CaCl 2 -exchangeable zinc concentrations were used as a measure of the bioavailable zinc fraction. After contamination, a reduction of total zinc and an increase of labile sorbed zinc over time occurred, concurrent with various changes in soil and biological characteristics. Data analyses on the nematode species revealed different sensitivity levels for several population and community endpoints to zinc exposure. Based on no observed effect concentration (NOEC) values, the most sensitive community-level response was obtained with principal response curve (PRC) analysis, which incorporates all density data in a single analysis. The PRC-based community NOECs were 56, 100, and 100 mg total Zn/kg dry soil after 3, 10, and 22 months of exposure, respectively. Based on 0. 01 M CaCl 2 -exchangeable zinc, the community response appeared to increase, as NOECs were 4. 9, 4. 4, and 0. 67 mg <b>exchangeable</b> Zn/kg dry <b>weight.</b> Total density was least sensitive, followed by diversity of taxa and the Shannon-Wiener index. NOECs for separate species covered a broad range from sensitive to tolerant species. This range of sensitivities was similar to the one found for other species groups tested in the field plot soil. A comparison was made between benchmark concentrations HC 5 and HC 50 derived from the general SSD of soil organisms for zinc and the nematode response data. These comparisons roughly confirm the predictions of the SSD model, that is, the community NOEC is in agreement with the benchmark that should protect the soil ecosystem's integrity, and large adverse effects were found at the benchmark derived for setting remediation urgency...|$|R
