40|$|Poor {{compliance}} is a {{major problem}} in paediatric asthma management, and several factors play role in this. These include route of administration- for inhaled medication oral therapy is preferred, frequency of dosing- once or twice daily regimens are preferred and concern of side effects. Concerns about side effects and compliance limit use of many currently recommended drugs. The systemic adverse effects ICSs limits it’s use in oral therapy even if it’s clinical benefit agreed by all current guidelines. <b>Doxofylline</b> is a novel bronchodilator xanthine drug and its bronchodilator activities have been demonstrated in animal studies and in clinical trials involving patients with either bronchial asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The mechanism of action {{is similar to that of}} theophylline. However, unlike theophylline, <b>doxofylline</b> has greatly decreased affinity towards adenosine A 1 and A 2 receptors, which explain its better safety profile. The bioavailability of <b>Doxofylline</b> is about 62. 6 % after oral administration [...] Because of the favourable profile and significant wider therapeutic window, <b>doxofylline</b> offers an opportunity to improve tolerability of methylxanthines. The main cardiovascular tolerability of <b>doxofylline</b> makes it unnecessary to monitor serum levels of the drug.

40|$|Background: Asthma {{is common}} chronic disease worldwide. Methylxanthines {{has been used}} in the {{treatment}} of asthma. The study was undertaken to compare two Methylxanthines theophylline and <b>doxofylline</b> at doses recommended and commonly used in clinical practice in Mild Bronchial Asthma Patients. Methods: Study was conducted in patients of Mild Bronchial Asthma in TB and chest disease department of a medical college hospital. It was randomized, prospective and open label. A total of 107 patients were divided in two group. Group I was administered 400 mg theophylline SR once daily and group II was administered <b>doxofylline</b> 400 mg twice a day orally. Spirometric variables symptom score, and adverse effects were recorded on day 0, 7 and 21 of therapy. Data were compared and analysed using SPSS version 16. Results: Results of the study showed that there was significant improvement in spirometric variables and clinical symptom score compared to pretreatment values after medication in both groups on 7 th and 21 st days of treatment. But there was no statistically significant difference between improvement in theophylline and <b>doxofylline</b> groups with respect to spirometric variables and symptom score.

40|$|<b>Doxofylline</b> is a methyl-xanthine with {{bronchodilator}} activity which clinical efficacy in {{the treatment}} of asthma and COPD is equivalent to theophylline. Clinical trials prooved that while <b>doxofylline</b> is as effective as theophylline {{in the treatment}} of asthma, it is associated with lesser side effects. For our pharmacoeconomical evaluation, we employed the data of an international multi-centric study that compared the efficacy and tolerability of 12 weeks of treatment with either theophylline 250 mg tid, or <b>doxofylline</b> 400 mg tid, or placebo. The efficacy was evaluated with pulmonary function tests and by recording the number of asthma attacks and beta- 2 agonist puffs: <b>doxofylline</b> 1200 mg/day and theophylline 750 mg/day resulted equally effective, but the former resulted better tolerated, as the adverse effects were lesser in number and severity. We performed a cost/effectiveness analysis in order to compare the two treatments, considering the perspective of the Italian health system (SSN) and of the Italian society. For the purposes of this analysis, the efficacy indices we considered were two: one simple, consisting in the number of avoided asthma attacks (AAA), and a more complex one, i. e. UATD (Utility Adjusted Therapy Days). For the construction of this index, we extracted the survival curve of the patients remaining in therapy; this curve showed that the cumulative number of therapy days is significantly greater in the <b>doxofylline</b> group, although the percentage of dropouts is similar {{at the end of the}} three months: this is due to the fact that the drop-outs in the theophylline group occur earlier after treatment start. The number of therapy days was then weighed for an utility index inversely proportional to the main daily number of avoided asthma attacks, thus obtaining the UATDs. The results of the cost/effectiveness analyses showed that <b>doxofylline</b> dominates theophylline treatment in asthma, as it is less expensive and more effective (in terms of AAAs and UATDs) for both considered decision-makers, i. e. Italian SSN and society. The consistency of these results was further confirmed by oneway sensitivity analyses...|$|E

40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the therapeutic effects of potato extract (PE) on cigarette smoke (CS) –induced {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). Methods: PE was first prepared by frozen centrifugation, and its amino acid composition was detected. Toxicity of PE was analyzed by changes in morphology, behavior, routine blood indexes, and biochemical criteria of mice. Then, the COPD rat model was established by CS exposure, and PE, <b>doxofylline,</b> and prednisolone acetate were used to treat these rats. After 45 days of treatment, the morphology and behavior of rats were recorded. In addition, the histopathology of lung tissue was evaluated by chest x-ray and hematoxylin and eosin staining. The expression of interleukine- 10 (IL- 10), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was detected in serum and lung tissue by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Results: Various amino acids were identified in PE, and no toxicity was exhibited in mice. The CS-induced COPD rat model was successfully established, which exhibited significant thickened and disordered lung markings on 90 % of the rats. After administering <b>doxofylline</b> and prednisolone acetate, inflammation symptoms were improved. However, side effects such as emaciation, weakness, and loosening of teeth appeared. In the PE group, obviously improved histopathology was observed in lung tissues. Meanwhile, it was revealed that PE could increase the expression of IL- 10 and reduce the expression of TNF-α and G-CSF in COPD rats, and <b>doxofylline</b> and prednisolone acetate also elicited similar results.
