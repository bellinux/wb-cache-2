40|$|The {{resiliency}} {{and adaptive}} ability of microbial life {{in real time}} on Earth relies heavily upon horizontal gene trans-fer. Based on that knowledge, how likely is earth based microbial life to colonize extraterrestrial targets such as Mars? To address this question, we consider manned and unmanned space explora-tion, the resident microbiota {{that is likely to}} inhabit those vehicles, the adaptive potential of that microbiota in an <b>extra-terrestrial</b> <b>setting</b> especially with regards to mobile genetic elements, and the likelihood that Mars like environments could initiate and sustain colonization. By the 1970 s, scientists James Lovelock and Lynn Margulis had developed a hypothesis known as the Gaia theory. 1 It proposed that organisms on Earth inter-act with their inorganic surroundings to form a self-regulating, complex system that contributes to the maintenance of conditions favorable for life on the planet. Whether or not you buy into the Gaian theory, extant Earth is an extraordinary and singular planet inhabiting what appears to be, a sterile solar system. (If not sterile, certainly life, in form and quantity as we know it, inhabits no other neighbor-ing planets). Our singular status in the vacuum of local space raises the question whether exchanges can breach the bounds of our atmosphere, creating conduits with extraterrestrial targets. We’ve known about the potential for backward contami-nation for some time. For instance, space debris enters our atmosphere in the form of meteorites continually. Researchers in the origin of life field have long considered the possibility that such events seeded life Man and his spaceships Vehicles for extraterrestrial colonization...|$|E
50|$|A new writer, Alan Moore, {{had started}} {{contributing}} Future Shocks in 1980. He wrote {{more than fifty}} one-off strips {{over the next three}} years, while also contributing to various Marvel UK titles and the independent magazine Warrior. In 1982 he gained his first series, Skizz, a less sentimental take on the same basic plot used in E.T. the <b>Extra-Terrestrial,</b> <b>set</b> in Birmingham and influenced by Alan Bleasdales Boys from the Blackstuff. The series was drawn by Jim Baikie.|$|R

Modification of feedhorn mounting on existing 34 -m-diameter antenna in Deep Space Network (DSN) enables antenna {{to be shared}} by Search for <b>Extra-Terrestrial</b> Intelligence (<b>SET)</b> program with minimal interruption of DSN spacecraft tracking. Modified antenna useful in terrestrial communication systems requiring frequent changes of operating frequencies...|$|R

She is now married to her third husband Robert MacNaughton, who portrayed Elliot's older brother in E.T. the <b>Extra-Terrestrial.</b> They were <b>set</b> up {{on a blind date}} by mutual friend, MacNaughton's E.T. co-star, Drew Barrymore when Hunter was a teenager. Together they have four sons.|$|R
40|$|The ∼ 1 km^ 3 IceCube {{neutrino}} observatory {{was completed}} in December, 2010 and is taking data on cosmic-ray muons and neutrinos, <b>extra-terrestrial</b> neutrinos, and <b>setting</b> limits {{on a variety of}} exotic phenomena. This proceeding will cover recent IceCube results, with an emphasis on cosmic-rays and on searches for extra-terrestrial neutrinos, with a stress on results that were presented at the 2013 International Cosmic Ray Conference. Comment: 9 pages; plenary highlight talk presented at the 2013 Intl. Cosmic Ray Conf. The full collaboration author list is available at [URL]...|$|R
