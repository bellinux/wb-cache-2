50|$|The bandgap {{determines the}} {{wavelength}} at which LEDs can emit {{light and the}} wavelength at which photovoltaics operate most efficiently. Wide-bandgap devices therefore are useful at shorter wavelengths than other semiconductor devices. The bandgap for GaAs of 1.4 eV, for example, corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 890 nm, which is invisible infrared light (the <b>equivalent</b> <b>wavelength</b> for light energy can be determined by dividing the constant 1240 nm-eV by the energy in eV, so 1240 nm-eV/1.4 eV=886 nm). Therefore, GaAs photovoltaics are not ideal for converting shorter-wavelength visible light into electricity. Silicon at 1.1 eV (1100 nm) is even worse. For solar-energy conversion using a single junction photovoltaic cell, the ideal bandgap has been variously estimated from around 1.0 eV up to around 1.5 eV (depending on various assumptions) because that low wavelength threshold covers nearly the entire solar spectrum that reaches the Earth's surface, but a lower-bandgap single-junction cell wastes {{a large portion of}} that power by inefficiently converting the shorter-wavelength parts of the solar spectrum. Because of this, a major area in solar energy research is developing multi-junction solar cells that collect separate parts of the spectrum with more efficiency, and wide bandgap photovoltaics are a key component for collecting the part of the spectrum beyond the infrared.|$|E

The configuration has collinear observation and illumination directions and therefore has maximum sensitivity to out-of-plane displacement. Wavelength modulation through adjustment of the laser diode control current provides a convenient method of phase shifting {{without the need for}} external moving parts. Further, variation of the laser diode control temperature allows extended wavelength tuning to adjacent longitudinal modes, facilitating surface contouring measurements via the two-wavelength technique.

40|$|Abstract- This article {{presents}} an optical measurement method for acquiring rapidly accurate geometric 3 -D surface morphology of objects. To achieve high-speed profilometry and avoid disturbance due to in-field vibration, one-shot Fourier transform profilometry (FTP) using two-wavelength digital moiré pattern {{was developed to}} detect the morphology of the measured object at a speed of up to 60 frames or more per second. Single-fringe interferogram sufficient for FTP can be rapidly captured within a theoretical CCD acquisition time of down to 1 μs. The interferogram thus captured can be applied for further phase retrieving using the developed frequency transform and band-pass filtering strategies. The band-pass filter is designed to obtain phase information for optimizing the 3 -D surface reconstruction with both dimensional and structural measurement accuracy. Furthermore, a standard step-height target was measured to analyze accuracy and repeatability of the developed methodology. Experimental results verified that the measurable step height can be effectively increased using the <b>equivalent</b> <b>wavelength</b> established by analyzing two-frequency moiré pattern, thus increasing practical applicability of the developed system while achieving a micro-scale measuring depth resolution.

40|$|Limited by {{the sparse}} {{light-splitting}} capability in WDM networks, some nodes need to reroute the optical packet to different destination nodes {{with the high}} cost of routing for reducing packet loss possibility. In the paper, the longest path reroute optimization algorithm is put forward to jointly optimize the multicast routing cost and wavelength channel assignment cost for sparse splitting WDM networks. Based on heuristic algorithms, the longest path reroute routing algorithm calls multiple longest paths in existing multicast tree to reroute the path passing from the nodes which are violating the light-splitting constraint to the nodes which are not violating light-splitting constraint with few wavelength channels and low rerouting cost. And a wavelength cost control factor is designed to select the reroute path with the lowest cost by comparing the multicast rerouting path cost increment with the <b>equivalent</b> <b>wavelength</b> channel required cost increment. By adjusting wavelength cost control factor, we can usually get the optimized multicast routing according to the actual network available wavelength conversion cost.

The method of spectral brightness conversion proposed by the authors serves as the founding principle of a universal measuring device that has a low rate of errors. This method is effective at different wavelengths. The number of errors is reduced two-fold: first, the number of instrument-related errors is reduced through increasing the sensitivity of the pyrometer and identifi cation of the finest pyrometry ratio. Second, the authors suggest using, at least, three effective wavelengths to register the spectral brightness. Moreover, the authors believe that the reduction of the systematic error of the measured optical transition temperature designated for the derivation of its genuine values requires the right choice of an effective wavelength so that the <b>equivalent</b> <b>wavelength</b> of the double spectral ratio became infinitely big. This methodology makes it possible to derive an independent pyrometry equation to identify unknown emissivity factors within three wavelengths.

40|$|Phase Shift Profilometry (PSP) {{method is}} widely used in 3 D shape measurement. The {{advantage}} of the PSP method {{is that it is}} less sensitive to the surface reflectivity variations and the object can be measured point by point. But if only a single wavelength λ 1 is used, the step height cannot be larger than λ 1 / 4. In order to measure step height object, Gray Code (GC) and Multi-Wavelength Phase Shift Profilometry (MWPSP) method are used. But the GC method cannot solve the problem of the objects with a variety of colors under different illumination. The shortcoming of MWPSP method is that its speed is too slow because a lot of images with multi-wavelengths should be captured by the system. In order {{to solve the problem of}} measurement speed and measurement range, a new phase unwrapping algorithm based on Three Wavelength Phase Shift Profilometry (TWPSP) is proposed in this paper.

It has been demonstrated that the BSO (Bi₁₂SiO₂₀) crystal is a practical holographic recording medium. BSO is a semiconductor and has a large electro-optic coefficient. These two properties of the BSO crystal are responsible for its capability to record. In this study, the linear and circular birefringence of the BSO crystal under an electric field were investigated. The measurement method is by passing a linearly polarized wavefield through the crystal. The transmitted wavefield is written in parametric expressions using Jones calculus, and the wavefield is probed by a simple ellipsometer. The two parameters in the Jones matrix, the linear and circular birefringence, are solved from the experimental data. The electro-optic coefficient is determined from the resulting linear birefringence to be 3. 57 x 10 ⁻¹⁰ cm/V at λ = 632. 8 nm. The diffraction efficiency and temporal response of the BSO crystal in the transverse electro-optic configuration were studied.

This navigational service has provided three-dimensional position within 30 meters and time within 100 ns to the civil community, which typically uses the coarse acquisition (C/A) code. The military GPS user has improved position accuracy within 6 meters using the dual GPS frequencies that carry the precise (P) code. The coarse resolution of a code measurement is about 1 / 10 of the smallest bit length of either code, which is about 29 m on C/A or 2. 9 m with P code.

Recent GPS technology has improved civil navigation close to the military precision limits;To improve the precision by at least a hundred-fold, this dissertation considers a new exact linear navigation algorithm compared to the standard iterative GPS solution and also considers a new method of measurement by combining both carrier and phase measurements to improve pseudoranges within a centimeter tolerance.

This study is part of a global effort to collect data to validate marine products of MERIS, the ENVISAT ocean colour sensor, as contracted by European Space Agency (ESA). Particulate absorptions were determined with Transmittance-Reflectance approach, using NaClO bleaching to remove phytoplankton contribution to the total particulate matter absorption spectra; YSBPA absorption coefficient was assessed according to MERIS validation protocols. Phytoplankton absorption coefficients were transformed into specific coefficients – a*ph(), normalizing it with respect to chlorophyll a concentrations determined both by HPLC and spectrophotometric methods. Results show that the absorption of light by particulate matter is almost totally dependent on the phytoplankton, with no significant contribution from non-algal particles (mean contribution of 10 % to total particulate absorption), both in coastal and oceanic waters, emphasising the dominance of case 1 -type waters.

Identification of weapons that {{are most likely to}} be concealed on-body, such as guns and knives has been demonstrated in an anechoic environment at stand-off distances. The identification of concealed weapons such as guns and knives relies on the excitation of these objects complex natural resonances (CNR). The CNR are excited by an incident Ultra-Wide band (UWB) electromagnetic pulse (or by frequency domain pulse synthesis), were the <b>equivalent</b> <b>wavelengths</b> are commensurate to the linear dimensions of the object and is thus closely related to, the comprehensively studied and reported, Mie scattering for a conducting sphere. An object's CNR spectrum is strongly independent of the orientation of the object, and therefore the CNR may be used as an aspect independent identification system. Initial experiments and finite element simulations clearly demonstrated the limitations of a bi-static radar method and a different approach was investigated which uses an phased array of UWB antennae consisting of multiple transceivers. With a phased array antenna system it is possible to spatially locate metallic object(s) and identify them based upon their characteristic CNR. Spatial location of conducting objects is achieved by locating significant 'Late Time Response' (LTR). Once an object is spatially located by the presence of a significant L TR, the transient may then he analysed to reveal the object's CNR and identification can then be made.

Considering the numerous images required in Zhao’s method, Li et al. [8] proposed two-frequency grating profilometry, which entails only one grating instead of changing gratings with different <b>equivalent</b> <b>wavelengths.</b> Zhang et al. [9] presented a phase unwrapping algorithm based on multi-frequency fringe projection. The method of combined fringes is also used in 3 D measurement. Zhang et al. [10] suggested a method that embeds a speckle-like signal in three sinusoidal fringe patterns to eliminate phase ambiguity. Basing from this technique, Feng et al. [11] proposed a novel speckle-embedded fringe projection method using a graphics processing unit to process data in real time. The Gray code plus phase-shifting method determines the codewords from image intensity [12 – 14]. However, the measurement resolution {{is limited by the}} errors derived from gray-level quantization and noise. Meanwhile, the codewords are less robust for measuring high-contrast surfaces and limited to 2 m (where m is regarded as the number of Gray code patterns). Liu et al. [15] developed a novel encoded-phase technique for phase measuring profilometry, in which the differentially wrapped phases are regarded as codewords. This method is suitable for capturing dynamic scenes, but it is influenced by object texture and noise. Wang et al. [16] presented a novel absolute phase recovery technique with a phase-coding fringe. This technique not only produces more codewords but also receives more robust measurement results for different fringe image brightness levels compared with Gray code techniques. Fu et al. [17] followed Wang’s theory and measured a blade with a complex shape. However, the measurement accuracy was reduced when numerous codewords were adopted. Different from the method proposed by Wang, Zheng et al. [18] introduced a technique wherein two sets of phase-coding fringes are projected to address the difficulty in judging the fringe order. Basing from Zheng’s foundation, Zhou et al. [19] developed a color fringe coding method to hasten the measurement speed. However, this technique was required to handle the color crosstalk. Chen [20] added a correction method to stabilize the phase-unwrapping algorithm. Meanwhile, Xu et al. [21] proposed an encoding strategy that increases the range of unique phase distribution to 10 π.

Tests show that the differences between filtered field intensity grids and the WMM 2015 or IGRF- 12 estimated grids taken as a reference are minimized using the following parameters, which are generalized in our study: (1) removing/restoring the average tendency, (2) padding/unpadding using the maximum entropy method (Burg 1975), and (3) applying an order- 12 Butterworth filter and a cut-off <b>wavelength</b> <b>equivalent</b> to the next higher SH degree (i.e. about 3080  km for SH degree 12 and 2860  km for SH degree 13). Statistics are then computed with a global extent reduced by 30 ° in latitude and 20 ° in longitude to avoid edge-filtering artefacts. Similarly, the NEAWM 0.5 ° grids are calculated at a global scale before filtering then reduced to the targeted extent.|$|R
