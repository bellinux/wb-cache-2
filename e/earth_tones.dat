5|$|Van Gogh painted {{several groups}} of still lifes in 1885. During his two-year stay in Nuenen, he {{completed}} numerous drawings and watercolours, and nearly 200 oil paintings. His palette consisted mainly of sombre <b>earth</b> <b>tones,</b> particularly dark brown, and {{showed no sign}} of the vivid colours that distinguish his later work.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{there is}} no attempt by the artist to soften the subject's {{brutality}} through technical skill. Method and subject are indivisible. Goya's procedure is determined less by the mandates of traditional virtuosity than by his intrinsically morbid theme. The brushwork could not be described as pleasing, and the colors are restricted to <b>earth</b> <b>tones</b> and black, punctuated by bright flashes of white and the red blood of the victims. The quality of the pigment itself foreshadows Goya's later works: a granular solution producing a matte, sandy finish. Few would admire the work for painterly flourishes, such is its horrific force and its lack of theatricality.|$|E
5|$|The First World War {{also saw}} the birth of aerial warfare, {{and with it the}} need not only to conceal {{positions}} and vehicles from being spotted from the air, but also the need to camouflage the aircraft themselves. In 1917, Germany started using a lozenge camouflage covering Central Powers aircraft, possibly the earliest printed camouflage. A similarly disruptive splinter pattern in <b>earth</b> <b>tones,</b> Buntfarbenanstrich 1918, was introduced for tanks in 1918, and was also used on the Stahlhelm (steel helmet), becoming the first use of a standardized camouflage pattern for soldiers.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Earth</b> <b>tone</b> is a {{color scheme}} that draws from a colour palette of browns, tans; any of various rich colors {{containing}} some brown. The colors in an <b>earth</b> <b>tone</b> scheme are muted and flat in an emulation {{of the natural}} colors found in dirt, moss, trees and rocks. Earthtone colors come from natural things around us: brown soil, green leaf, sky, {{as well as the}} red sun. These palettes can create a warm, nature-friendly atmosphere Natural tones are also considered [...] "Earth tones".|$|R
5|$|Pigments are {{coloured}} chemicals (such as melanin) {{in animal}} tissues. For example, the Arctic fox has a white coat in winter (containing little pigment), and a brown coat in summer (containing more pigment), {{an example of}} seasonal camouflage (a polyphenism). Many animals, including mammals, birds, and amphibians, are unable to synthesize most of the pigments that colour their fur or feathers, other than the brown or black melanins that give many mammals their <b>earth</b> <b>tones.</b> For example, the bright yellow of an American goldfinch, the startling orange of a juvenile red-spotted newt, the deep red of a cardinal and the pink of a flamingo are all produced by carotenoid pigments synthesized by plants. In {{the case of the}} flamingo, the bird eats pink shrimps, which are themselves unable to synthesize carotenoids. The shrimps derive their body colour from microscopic red algae, which like most plants are able to create their own pigments, including both carotenoids and (green) chlorophyll. Animals that eat green plants do not become green, however, as chlorophyll does not survive digestion.|$|E

25|$|Le Chahut is an oil {{painting}} on canvas measuring 170 by 141cm (67 x 55 in). Seurat employed a Divisionist style, with pointillist dots of color. The work {{is dominated by}} a color scheme that tends toward the red end of the spectrum, of <b>earth</b> <b>tones</b> that draw from a palette of browns, tans, warm grays, and blues, interspersed with not just the primary colors (reds and yellows), nor even with the six principal colors, but with eighteen mixtures on his palette prior to application on the canvas (any {{of which could be}} mixed with white). A deeper blue border painted {{around the edge of the}} canvas culminates in a shallow arch on the upper edge.|$|E

500|$|Hoover {{felt that}} the series' use of a {{consistent}} palette of reds and <b>earth</b> <b>tones</b> allowed the introduction of strong black elements into set and costume design; he cited elements of Blackie O'Reilly's office in One Eyed Jacks as an example: its vibrant red curtains and ruddy wood tones were offset by her stark black outfit and dark hair. The hues in the footage filmed for the series were [...] "sweetened" [...] in post-production, increasing the saturation of the red tones; this also caused black elements to seem deeper and more striking. This effect was offset by the clothing {{of several of the}} law enforcement characters, which had cooler tones and contrasted against the warm palette.|$|E
500|$|Nolan built {{only one}} {{set for the}} film, an [...] "under-the-stage section that houses the {{machinery}} that makes the larger illusions work," [...] preferring to simply dress various Los Angeles locations and sound stages to stand in for Colorado and Victorian England. In contrast to most period pieces, Nolan kept up the quick pace of production by shooting with handheld cameras, and refrained from using artificial lighting in some scenes, relying instead on natural light on location. Costume designer Joan Bergin chose attractive, modern Victorian fashions for Scarlett Johansson; cinematographer Wally Pfister captured the mood with soft <b>earth</b> <b>tones</b> as white and black colors provided background contrasts, bringing actors' faces to the foreground.|$|E
500|$|The {{story is}} told from Clark's point of view, so color schemes and camera {{selection}} illustrate how he interprets his environment. When he is safe at home, the colors are [...] "warm and gentle" [...] <b>earth</b> <b>tones</b> and the camera movement is [...] "very gentle". When Clark is keeping his secret and not in danger, the lighting is more neutral and the camera more mobile. When danger is present, the lighting becomes colder and the camera is handheld to allow for more [...] "extreme angles". In Metropolis [...] "clean, hard-lined architecture" [...] predominates, with blues, purples and reflective metals the dominant scheme. The same concept {{is used for the}} characters; Lex usually has a [...] "glass, steel background", and Lionel has a white or [...] "clinical blue" [...] background. Lex typically wears black, grey and [...] "cool tones" [...] (purples and blues). Clark is represented by red, yellow and blue, similar to the traditional Superman costume, and [...] "All-American" [...] red, white and blue. From season two onward, Entity FX produced all of the visual effects for Smallville, including the view of the Metropolis skyline.|$|E
50|$|All {{forms on}} the glass are {{outlined}} with lead wire and filled in with <b>earth</b> <b>tone</b> oil paint. The colors range from pale grey to gold to dark brown and black.

2500|$|Viewed from an anthropological perspective, hacking is a {{cultural}} tradition affirming group solidarity, but some hacks can also be viewed as individualistic creative or artistic expression.

2500|$|In pose and coloring, many of Johnston's portraits {{strongly}} {{resemble those}} of Sir Godfrey Kneller, {{which at the time}} were greatly in fashion in the United Kingdom and the colonies. [...] Her pastels from Ireland are drawn in deep <b>earth</b> <b>tones,</b> while those from her time in South Carolina are generally lighter and smaller, due likely to the precious nature of her materials, which had to be imported. [...] The Irish works, which show the most attention to detail of all her works, depict sitters at three-quarter length, as do the earliest of her Carolina pastels. [...] Johnston's American female subjects are usually shown wearing chemises, while the male subjects are drawn mostly in street clothes; some of the latter are depicted wearing armor. [...] Each subject is shown sitting erect, with the head frequently turned at a slight angle from the body and towards the viewer. [...] The faces are typically dominated by large oval eyes. [...] Works dating to after her second husband's death are less finished; details of clothing are less well-defined and colors are less saturated, suggesting either that the artist was running out of materials or that she was working at greater speed to complete commissions.|$|E
2500|$|The new {{expansion}} {{opened in}} 2001. According to the Great Falls Tribune, a local newspaper, [...] "With the expansion, the museum reached {{a sort of}} critical mass that tipped it {{into the ranks of}} the world's major Western art museums." [...] One of the biggest logistical changes the expansion made was moving the main entrance of the museum from the south to the north side. The new galleries featured walls in warm <b>earth</b> <b>tones,</b> hundreds of artworks in storage were put on display. The expansion also allowed the museum to display the Mint Saloon's original safe. T.D. Kelsey's bronze sculpture of two bison, Change of Seasons, was placed near the east entrance. The next year, the Allen Foundation for the Arts gave the museum a $10,000 grant to help it build visitorship. Also in 2002, an anonymous bidder purchased the Russell watercolor [...] "Waiting" [...] for $240,000 and then donated it to the museum. In 2003, facing high costs to keep the museum open, the C.M. Russell Museum closed the Bair Family Museum. In March 2003, the museum purchased Russell's oil painting [...] "Four Generations." [...] The work had been owned by the local salvage firm Carl Weissman & Sons, Inc., but in 1962 the company gave the museum a one-third interest in it. The firm went bankrupt in 2002 and was ordered to sell its remaining interest in the painting. The purchase price for the $260,000 work was $173,342. Later that year, clay sculptures depicting the museum through the years were installed in the sculpture garden.|$|E
2500|$|While Pakimé pottery is {{inspired}} by pre-Hispanic pottery, {{it is not an}} exact copy. Unlike other parts of Mexico, the pottery tradition broke completely here sometime during the colonial period. The current residents do not consider themselves to be the descendents of the Casas Grandes culture nor do their traditions tie to it. No one before Quezada's generation was involved with pottery. This has allowed the potters to experiment and test the limits of form and design, unlike many other Mexican potters who are constrained by generations of tradition. However, Quezada's recreation is interesting because he recreated two of the basic potting techniques from the pre-Hispanic period, the coil and molding methods. The raw clay is dug with a pick and shovel in the rugged foothills outside the town. It is cleaned by soaking it in water until it can be poured through a sieve. White clay is a favorite to work with but many colors are used. A potter's wheel is not used. The bottom of the pot is molded and the upper part is created by the coil method. When the pot is dry, it is rubbed with a stone or other hard object to make it shine. This can take days. Pots are fired on the open ground using wood and manure for fuel. Paints are made with mineral pigments collected locally. The pigments are ground into a powder using a metate grinding stone, then mixed with clay to [...] make a milky fluid paint. Many use traditional colors such as red, white and <b>earth</b> <b>tones,</b> but brighter colors have also been used. Brushes are made from dog, cat and even human hair.|$|E
