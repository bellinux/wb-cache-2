25|$|The gauche {{effect is}} very {{sensitive}} to solvent effects, due to the large difference in polarity of the two conformers. For example, 2,3-dinitro-2,3-dimetylbutane, which in the solid state exists only in the <b>gauche</b> <b>conformation,</b> prefers the gauche conformer in benzene solution by a ratio of 79:21, but in carbon tetrachloride it prefers the anti conformer by a ratio of 58:42. Another case is trans-1,2 difluorocyclohexane, which has a larger preference for the eq/eq conformer in more polar solvents.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} {{explanations}} for the gauche effect: hyperconjugation and bent bonds. In the hyperconjugation model, the donation of electron density from the C–H σ bonding orbital to the C–F σ* antibonding orbital is considered the source of stabilization in the gauche isomer. Due to the greater electronegativity of fluorine, the C–H σ orbital is a better electron donor than the C–F σ orbital, while the C–F σ* orbital is a better electron acceptor than the C–H σ* orbital. Only the <b>gauche</b> <b>conformation</b> allows good overlap between the better donor and the better acceptor.|$|E

2500|$|Key in {{the bent}} bond {{explanation}} of the gauche effect in difluoroethane is the increased p orbital character of both C–F bonds due to the large electronegativity of fluorine.

[...] The resulting reduced orbital overlap can be partially compensated when a <b>gauche</b> <b>conformation</b> is assumed, forming a bent bond.

A collective behavior of dipole dynamics is inferred from the non-Debye asymmetric relaxation peak shape and strong coupling of the dipole relaxation path with some bending vibrations of the n-alkyl OML (multi-excitation entropy model). A variety of relaxation mechanisms is observed in the frequency range (0. 1 Hz- 10 MHz) with different dependence of relaxation frequency and dipolar strength on measurement temperature and applied voltage. Their microscopic origin is discussed by comparing the activation energy of relaxation frequency with previous molecular mechanics calculations of saddle point energy barriers for structural defects such as <b>gauche</b> <b>conformations</b> or chain kinks in n-alkanes assemblies. <b>Gauche</b> <b>conformations</b> organized in pairs (kinks) have vanishing relaxation strength below an order-disorder transition temperature T D[*][*]=[*][*] 175 [*]K and their probability strongly increases with applied reverse voltage, above T D.

The trans and gauche conformers display significantly different Franck-Condon region photodissociation dynamics, which indicates that the C-I bond breaking is conformational dependent. In particular, there are large differences in the trans and gauche short-time photodissociation dynamics for the torsional motion (xGBx) about the GB carbon-carbon bond and the GBC angle (where C=α-carbon atom attached to the iodine atom, B=β-carbon atom attached to the α-carbon atom.
