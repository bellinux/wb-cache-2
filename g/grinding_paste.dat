50|$|Suchard {{was born}} in 1797 in Boudry. According to the memoirs of his sister Rosalie, {{he became aware of}} the {{potentialities}} of chocolate manufacturing as an industry at the very early age of about twelve. To fulfill his dream, six years later he started as an apprentice in his brother Frédéric's Konditorei in Bern. In 1824 he left Switzerland to visit the United States. At {{the end of the year}} he returned and opened a confectioner's business in Neuchâtel. In 1826, Suchard opened the factory of Chocolat Suchard in Serrières. He used hydropower of the nearby river to run the mills in his two-man factory. Suchard used a grinding mill consisting of a heated granite plate, and several granite rollers moving forwards and backwards. This design is still used to <b>grind</b> cocoa <b>paste.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Avakaya: The {{most popular}} item of Andhra cuisine. It {{is made of}} cut green mangos, mustard powder, red chili powder and {{vegetable}} oil. It is prepared during April/May, when green mangos are abundant. Every family in Andhra has its own recipe for this pickle based on the variety of mango, chili and the oil used. Like Gongura pachadi, it exemplifies the Andhra cuisine and is a staple of showcase Andhra lunches. For many Andhrites, it is a must have side dish with any pappu item. Mudda pappu (cooked toor dal) and avakaya combined is a staple in most households. There are umpteen varieties of avakaya — with or without garlic and depending on the other ingredients used like pesarakaya (avakaya with moong dal powder), menthi kaya (avakaya with fenugreek powder), neeti kaya (avakaya made by <b>grinding</b> mustard <b>paste</b> with water).|$|R
50|$|In modern {{steel drum}} mills the {{grinding}} process takes about 20 minutes. After <b>grinding,</b> the <b>paste</b> is stirred slowly for another 20 to 30 {{minutes in a}} particular container (malaxation), where the microscopic oil drops unite into bigger drops, which facilitates the mechanical extraction. The paste is then pressed by centrifugation/ the water is thereafter separated from {{the oil in a}} second centrifugation as described before.The oil produced by only physical (mechanical) means as described above is called virgin oil. Extra virgin olive oil is virgin olive oil that satisfies specific high chemical and organoleptic criteria (low free acidity, no or very little organoleptic defects). A higher grade extra virgin olive oil is mostly dependent on favourable weather conditions; a drought during the flowering phase, for example, can result in a lower quality (virgin) oil. It is worth noting that olive trees produce well every couple of years so greater harvests occur in alternate years (the year in-between is when the tree yields less). However the quality is still dependent on the weather.|$|R
50|$|Earth {{paintings}} {{are typical of}} Arnold's art as she uses a unique material. She paints pictures with sorts of soil, minerals and stones on nettle fabric and on stone. She collects her colours in form of minerals which she then <b>grinds</b> to a <b>paste</b> for painting. The titles of her pictures correspond to the places across the world where she has found her ingredients, like Flagstaff, Arizona or Bryce Canyon in Utah. The structures, forms and colours of those paintings mirror {{the quality of the}} landscape where they are created on site. There they are exposed to the natural conditions of the place which even enhance their intensity.|$|R
5000|$|Deinagkistrodon acutus venom {{has been}} used in {{traditional}} Chinese medicine for centuries to extract antivenin that is successfully used to treat snakebites. Different parts of the snake are also prescribed to help alleviate ailments known as “wind diseases.” Because these snakes move so quickly, it is theorized that substances from their bodies can easily treat these fast moving “wind” syndromes. Deinagkistrodon acutus is currently used in patients with arthritis, leprosy, tetanus, boils, and, as previously mentioned, tumors. It is believed that the same qualities that make snakes flexible, capable of regenerating skin, and able to inflict paralysis can be transferred to human conditions if applied medicinally. The vipers are prepared by cooking the flesh of the headless body, <b>grinding</b> a <b>paste</b> of snake ash and mixing it with honey, drying the snake and compacting it into a powder, or even injecting their venom intravenously. Although these practices are common in Chinese medicine, there are no current studies that have affirmed the effectiveness of these treatments. It is unknown whether or not these [...] "cures" [...] simply have a placebo effect or actually heal the patients.|$|R
50|$|If {{ground with}} mill stones, the olive paste {{generally}} stays under the stones for 30 to 40 minutes. A shorter grinding process {{may result in}} a more raw paste that produces less oil and has a less ripe taste, a longer process may increase oxidation of the paste and reduce the flavor. After <b>grinding,</b> the olive <b>paste</b> is spread on fiber disks, which are stacked {{on top of each other}} in a column, then placed into the press. Pressure is then applied onto the column to separate the vegetal liquid from the paste. This liquid still contains a significant amount of water. Traditionally the oil was shed from the water by gravity (oil is less dense than water). This very slow separation process has been replaced by centrifugation, which is much faster and more thorough. The centrifuges have one exit for the (heavier) watery part and one for the oil. Olive oil should not contain significant traces of vegetal water as this accelerates the process of organic degeneration by microorganisms. The separation in smaller oil mills is not always perfect, thus sometimes a small watery deposit containing organic particles can be found at the bottom of oil bottles.|$|R
