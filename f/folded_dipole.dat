5|$|Transmissions {{took place}} {{from a single}} {{arrowhead}} antenna mounted on {{the nose of the}} aircraft. This consisted of a <b>folded</b> <b>dipole</b> with a passive director in front of it, both bent rearward at about 35 degrees, projecting from the nosecone on a mounting rod. For vertical reception, the receiver antennas consisted of two half-wave unipoles mounted above and below the wing, with a reflector behind them. The wing acted as a signal barrier, allowing the antennas to see only the portion of the sky above or below the wing as well as directly in front. These antennas were angled rearward at the same angle as the transmitter. The horizontal receivers and directors were mounted on rods projecting from {{the leading edge of the}} wing, the antennas aligned vertically. The fuselage and engine nacelles formed the barriers for these antennas.|$|E
25|$|Another solution, {{especially}} for receiving antennas, {{is to use}} common 300Ω twin lead {{in conjunction with a}} <b>folded</b> <b>dipole.</b> The <b>folded</b> <b>dipole</b> is similar to the simple half-wave dipole but with the feedpoint impedance multiplied by 4, thus closely matching that 300Ω impedance. This is the most common household antenna for fixed FM broadcast band tuners, which usually include balanced 300Ω antenna input terminals.|$|E

40|$|Broadband antenna feeds are of {{particular}} interest to existing and future radio telescopes for multi-frequency studies of astronomical sources. Although a 1 : 15 range in frequency is difficult to achieve, the well-known Eleven feed design offers a relatively uniform response over such a range, and reasonably well-matched responses in E & H planes. However, given the severe Radio Frequency Interference in several bands over such wide spectral range, one desires to selectively reject the corresponding bands. With this view, we have explored the possibilities of having a multi-band feed antenna spanning a wide frequency range, but which would have good response only in a number of pre-selected (relatively) RFI-free windows (for a particular telescope-site). The designs we have investigated use the basic configuration of pairs of dipoles as in the Eleven feed, but use simple wire <b>dipoles</b> instead of <b>folded</b> <b>dipoles</b> used in the latter. From our study of the two designs we have investigated, we find that the design with feed-lines constructed using co-axial lines shows good rejection in the unwanted parts of the spectrum and control over the locations of resonant bands.

40|$|In recent years, passive radio {{frequency}} (RF) tags that communicate using modulated backscatter radiation have shown {{great potential for}} use in inventory management, parcel and postal tracking, for use as remote sensors, and {{in a host of}} other Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) applications. However, for the widespread use of these tags to become reality, much basic research is needed to reduce the cost, increase the range, and increase the reliability of the RF tag. This research seeks to enhance the performance of passive RF tags by developing a series of tests, or radio assay, to measure the following: the performance of RF tag antennas as a function of antenna material and manufacturing technique and the antenna performance when attached to various materials. The radio assay experiments are designed for RF tag antennas that operate in the far field of the tag reader and communicate using modulated backscatter radiation at 915 MHz. Three flexible, <b>folded</b> <b>dipoles,</b> printed on plastic substrates, were measured in the radio assay experiments. The results of the experiments include the following: the antenna gain penalty (relative to a baseline antenna) for each antenna material and manufacturing technique, the antenna gain penalty (relative to the free space antenna gain) due to material losses when the tag antenna is attached to an object, and the benefits (in terms of antenna gain) of tuning each tag antenna to the material to which it is attached.

40|$|Passive Coherent Location (PCL) radar {{has proved}} to be {{feasible}} in a number of experimental systems, but the lack of comprehensive, published flight trials detracts somewhat from serious consideration of these PCL systems for operational applications, such as Air Traffic Control (ATC). The carrying out of flight trials is, in any case, difficult and very expensive. This dissertation presents a method for accurately predicting the performance of a bistatic passive coherent location radar with the effects of the environment taken into account. The effect of the environement on a propagating electromagnetic wave is obtained from the Advanced Refractive Effects Prediction System (AREPS) model. The resulting performance predictions, in the form of spatial signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) and signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (SNIR) maps, provide a powerful planning tool for the application of systems such as ATC. Furthermore, the spatial coverage maps, based on the bistatic radar equation, can be related to a particular probability of detection and false alarm as well as to a required dynamic range of the receiver ADC. Overall, the method provides a visual, as well as a quantitative measure of radar coverage with region-specific atmospheric and terrain effects taken into account. The method proposed in this dissertation offers a marked improvement over traditional performance prediction methods based on the bistatic radar equation within a free space or flat terrain environment. It is understood that the direct path signal of the illuminating transmitter is the cause of some severe limitations within a PCL system. In the interest of suppressing the strong direct signal before the ADC and to complement the development of the prediction method, an antenna pattern was synthesised and applied to an array of <b>folded</b> <b>dipoles</b> in order to place a null {{in the direction of the}} strong transmitter. The synthesised antenna pattern and its improvement on the performance of the PCL system was then evaluated using the proposed prediction method presented in this dissertation...|$|R
