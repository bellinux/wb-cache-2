5|$|Babbit {{recruited}} Clea DuVall, who had {{starred in}} her short film Sleeping Beauties, {{to play the}} role of Graham Eaton. Babbit says that she was able to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of the cast through DuVall, including Natasha Lyonne and Melanie Lynskey. Lyonne first saw the script in the back of DuVall's car and subsequently contacted her agent about it. She had seen and enjoyed Babbit's short Sleeping Beauties and was eager to work with the director. She was not the first choice for the role of Megan. An unnamed actress wanted to play the part but eventually turned it down because of religious beliefs; she did not want her family to see her face on the poster. Babbit briefly considered Rosario Dawson as Megan but her executive producer persuaded her that Dawson, who is Hispanic, would not be right for the All-American character.|$|E
5|$|Dual Destinies was {{the first}} game in the main series to be {{developed}} for the Nintendo 3DS; this move from the Nintendo DS to the Nintendo 3DS {{was the most difficult}} part of the development, with the development team being unsure of whether to use 2D graphics like with previous games or to use 3D models. Eventually they decided to use 3D graphics, because of the stereoscopic 3D effect being a selling point for the Nintendo 3DS system. Because of the move to 3D, the in-house artist Takuro Fuse was in charge of the art direction, rather than the series regular Tatsuro Iwamoto, so that they could have meetings about the art more often. This was Fuse's first work on the main series, so he initially had problems with making character designs that fit the series, and had to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of feedback from Eshiro. According to Eshiro and Yamazaki, they put effort into the graphics, wanting to ensure that Dual Destinies graphics looked better than those of Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney.|$|E

25|$|Streets of Fire {{began in}} the {{euphoria}} of knowing that Paramount really liked 48 {{and wanted to be}} in business with us if they could. What happened was that after we screened that cut for Paramount, Larry looked at Walter and said, “Paramount is pregnant; let’s get something and set it up right away.” Walter knew what he meant—that we were in a great position here—so he said, “We can do this two ways: present an idea now and get a deal done, or write a script on spec and <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more money.” Walter proudly considers himself a capitalist, so he suggested we do the latter.|$|E
25|$|Hull {{was born}} in a log house in Akron, New York on May 24, 1884. He was born to a {{powerful}} father who was known to have a violent temper. His father was largely uneducated and married his mother, a shy woman from Connecticut, when she was 15. Clark’s father didn’t <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of schooling because his father worked a lot as a child, so he didn’t learn how to read and was eventually taught by his wife. At the age of three or four, Hull and his family moved to a farm in Michigan. Here, he and his younger brother, Wayne, helped the farm by performing manual labor and chores around the house.|$|E
25|$|Because of the unorthodox {{nature of}} hand and body position, {{it is often}} {{difficult}} to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of power behind a reverse sweep; in many situations, the intention is to glance or cut the ball to the backward leg area. However, in rare occasions, players have been able to execute reverse sweeps for a six. Kevin Pietersen, who pioneered switch hitting, is adept at this, but one could argue that the resulting shot is basically a sweep rather than a reverse sweep. A more classic example of such a shot would be Yusuf Pathan's six off Robin Peterson. South Africa's AB de Villiers is well known for his ability to hit sixes with the reverse sweep at ease and Glenn Maxwell also often plays reverse sweep.|$|E

25|$|Seam bowlers can <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of {{help from}} certain types of pitches. Hard pitches that have a cracked or ridged surface are best for seam bowling since the {{hardness}} {{makes it easier to}} bounce the ball without losing speed while the uneven surface adds to the unpredictability of the bounce when the ball hits the pitch. This is known as variable bounce. On rare occasions, an extremely hard and uneven pitch is declared too dangerous to play on, since the batsman cannot predict the ball, and are likely to be hit as a result. Green pitches can also assist the seam bowler since the tiny tufts of grass represent an uneven surface although this is a mixed blessing since the green surface also slows the ball slightly. It is difficult for a seam bowler to be effective on a very flat and even-surfaced pitch (known as a flat track in cricket vernacular) and seamers usually resort to aggressive bowling tactics and/or bowling cutters on such surfaces.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} deliver the {{developed}} product to the customer, the vendor needs to package the different components of its product into a package. By doing this, the customer will receive all the information and software components at once fulfilling all its needs. After combining all elements into one package the software vendor will carefully have to check if the package is complete. The package will have to provide the customer with all the tools and information to use the product. When {{this is not the}} case the software vendor will <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of questions from its customers which will consume a lot of time. It is therefore very important that the package is checked carefully before it is shipped. The package can be a physical combination of different elements packed into for example a box, but it can also be a digital combination of files which contain all the elements. Within the CCU process it is stated that a package will consist of five elements, being: software package, system description, manual, and license and management information. In the following paragraphs is explained how these elements fit into the CCU delivery phase.|$|E
