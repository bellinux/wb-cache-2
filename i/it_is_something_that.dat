5|$|Months earlier, before Ellie meets Joel, Ellie's friend Riley (Yaani King) surprises Ellie {{at their}} {{boarding}} school after weeks away. She reveals {{that she has}} joined the Fireflies, a revolutionary militia group, and takes Ellie to explore an abandoned shopping mall. Riley reveals {{that she has been}} assigned to a group of Fireflies in a different city, and broke the rules to see Ellie again. The girls argue, but Ellie eventually tells her that she supports her decision as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> Riley has wanted for a long time. Before parting, Riley plugs Ellie's walkman into the sound system and dances with her. Ellie tearfully begs Riley not to leave. Riley rips her dog tags off and Ellie kisses her. Drawn by the noise, the Infected pursue Ellie and Riley; they run, but are bitten. They consider suicide, but choose to spend their final hours together.|$|E

The proposed show {{would focus on}} the town in general, rather than the Simpson family. Every week would be a different scenario: three short stories, an adventure with young Homer or {{a story about a}} background character that was not tied into the Simpson family at all. The idea never came to anything, as Groening realized that the staff did not have the manpower to produce another show as well as The Simpsons. The staff believe <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> they would still be interested in doing, and that [...] "could happen someday." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album is}} {{inspired}} {{by a variety of}} different artists, ranging from Amy Winehouse and Christina Aguilera to Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. Grande describes the album's first half is a [...] "throwback" [...] to the R music of the 1990s, and the second half is she describes as [...] "something that is very unique and very special that I've sort of written" [...] which is completely original. In summation of the record she stated: [...] "So half of it is a throwback and like very familiar feeling, feel-good, and then half of <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> I've created that's sort of special and unique and refreshing and wonderful and I love it".|$|E
500|$|... "Make the World Move" [...] {{received}} a mixed response from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic described the collaboration between Aguilera and Green as a [...] "pulsating party," [...] while Andrew Hampp for Billboard described the song as [...] "a barn-storming party anthem". Hampp was complimentary of the song's arrangement, writing that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> {{would have worked}} well on Aguilera's fifth studio album, Back to Basics (2006), which features prominent 1940's music influences. He praised da Kid's production, writing that he has bought a 1940s inspired song into the [...] "2010s". Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club wrote that the [...] "Make the World Move" [...] is [...] "a dizzying duet" [...] and is [...] "downright inspiring."

500|$|Priya Elan for NME was {{critical}} of Lewis's execution of the song [...] "Hurt", writing that she sounds as though the singer took [...] "too much Night Nurse the evening before." [...] Elan noted that the composition of [...] "Hurt" [...] {{was similar to that}} of Lewis's cover of [...] "Run", writing [...] "there's an awful lot of layered build up to the chorus before a full band and orchestra come in during the second verse." [...] However, Elan concluded her review saying that although she appears not to know the legacy of the song, Lewis sounds [...] "pretty". Katherine St. Asaph for PopDust described Lewis's interpretation of [...] "Hurt" [...] as being formulaic like a [...] "template", writing that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> American Idol and The X Factor winners and contestants seem do when covering a song. St. Asaph continued to explain her opinions with regard to Lewis and [...] "Hurt", writing [...] "For Leona, that's big notes in bigger arrangements, with a couple hushed sections for contrast." [...] She was also skeptical of Lewis's emotive abilities, writing [...] "Either she knows that quiet-to-loud arrangements and whispered vocals can simulate gravitas pretty well regardless of whether you’re thinking of pain or grocery lists, or she’s genuinely feeling something that comes out in her voice." ...|$|E
500|$|Borscht is {{associated}} with and claimed by several ethnic groups, especially Ukrainians, Russians, Poles, Lithuanians and Ashkenazi Jews, as their own national or ethnic dish and cultural icon. Such claims are not necessarily mutually exclusive, as the soup's history predates the emergence in Eastern Europe of modern nation states with their ever-shifting borders. Borscht, {{in the words of}} Burlakoff, [...] "is perfectly suited to a global culture." [...] He describes it as [...] "a global phenomenon", in which [...] "local variants are so numerous and diverse that it is hard sometimes for a non-specialist to grasp that any single example of <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> is part of a unified tradition." [...] In his view, borscht [...] "is an almost perfect example of... 'glocalization' – a phenomenon that is global in distribution but reflective of local needs and ways in its variants and adaptation;... a highly localized product that became globalized, and in the process adapted to conditions other than the original ones." [...] However, according to Irina Perianova, a Russian linguist and anthropologist, [...] "people tend to be very proprietal about their food and proud of it." [...] Perianova offers competing Russian and Ukrainian views on the origin and ingredients of borscht as an example of [...] "a common connection between culinary and territorial claims", which results in the culinary area turning into [...] "a battlefield generating and proliferating all kinds of myths." ...|$|E
500|$|Jennifer Lopez: Feelin' So Good {{opens with}} an intertitle that {{features}} a behind-the-scenes look at Lopez during the artwork shoot for On the 6, artist's proof of said photoshoot and brief clips of the music videos to the album's five singles. In the second chapter, [...] "Why Risk a Music Career?", Lopez is interviewed by her sister Lynda Lopez, who oversees each interview segment, {{about the risks of}} starting a music career after having an already thriving movie career. Critics believed that she was only launching a music career with an intent to expand her brand, while Lopez felt as if it was simply the [...] "next natural step" [...] in her career. Lopez's manager Benny Medina further discusses this, labeling her as the [...] "ultimate" [...] triple threat – [...] "the actor, singer and dancer". Lopez then confers, in the chapter [...] "Press Tours / Promotions", about the extensive promotional schedule she was on to promote the album. She examines the differences in promoting an album and a film, stating that promoting an album is more [...] "personal" [...] as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> is [...] "closer to your heart" [...] and something she [...] "really believes in". According to Lopez, {{by the end of the}} promotional tour for the album she [...] "lost" [...] her voice from the amount of interviews she had. Following this, Lopez's performance of the Darkchild remix of [...] "If You Had My Love" [...] at the 1999 VH1 Fashion Awards is shown.|$|E

500|$|The {{controversy}} {{raises questions}} about the range to which copyright law can extend. Alex Chapman of Campbell Hooper solicitors, stated [...] "The Church will have an uphill battle in a legal claim against Sony, and indeed it is likely that there is no basis for a claim." [...] He cited a provision in the UK's 1988 Copyright Designs and Patents act that [...] "explicitly states that it is not copyright infringement to represent certain artistic works that are on public display". This includes sculptures and buildings which are [...] "permanently situated in a public place or in premises open to the public". Chapman also pointed out that, in the UK, copyright expires 70 years after the person who created the work dies. He went on to say, [...] "What all this means is that public buildings are generally fair game for inclusion in video games, films et cetera, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> their owners just have to accept. What isn't fair game, however, is if the building is presented in a way that could be said to be defamatory in relation to those associated with it and this might be what the Church is more concerned about. Also if the representation of the building could be argued to have become so closely associated with a business that its representation amounts to a false endorsement of Sony or its products, or it is registered as a trademark, there may be issues. In each case however my impression is that the Church will have some difficulty in pursuing Sony. There is no law against insensitivity and as with many matters of this kind, it is the public reaction that might be more damaging than the legal one." [...] An unofficial review, by lawyers at Freeth Cartwright, of the rights that Sony might have infringed concluded that the Church of England did not have a case on either copyright or passing off grounds.|$|E

2500|$|Cheryl Thompson writes, [...] "In 15th-century Africa, hairstyles {{were used}} to {{indicate}} a person's marital status, age, religion, ethnic identity, wealth and rank within the community (see Byrd & Tharps, 2001; Jacobs-Huey, 2006; Mercer, 1994; Patton, 2006; Rooks, 1996). For young black girls, Thompson says, [...] "hair is not just something to play with" [...] – <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> sends a message, {{not only to the}} outside public but also a message on how they see themselves.

Chemical relaxers increased in demand throughout the 1800s and 1900s.

2500|$|Throughout Lorde's career she {{included}} {{the idea of}} a collective identity in many of her poems and books. Audre Lorde did not just identify with one category but she wanted to celebrate all parts of herself equally. She was known to describe herself as African-American, black, dyke, feminist, poet, mother, etc. In her novel [...] Lorde focuses on how her many different identities shape her life and the different experiences she has because of them. She shows us that personal identity is found within the connections between seemingly different parts of life. Personal identity is often associated with the visual aspect of a person, but as Lies Xhonneux theorizes when identity is singled down to just to what you see, some people, even within minority groups, can become invisible. In her late book The Cancer Journals she said [...] "If I didn't define myself for myself, I would be crunched into other people's fantasies for me and eaten alive." [...] This is important because an identity is more than just what people see or think of a person, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> must be defined by the individual. [...] "The House of Difference" [...] is a phrase that has stuck with Lorde's identity theories. Her idea was that everyone is different from each other and it is the collective differences that make us who we are, instead of one little thing. Focusing on all of the aspects of identity brings people together more than choosing one piece of an identity.|$|E
