The game can be played alone or with multiple players.|$|E
5|$|First-line {{treatment}} of AML consists primarily of chemotherapy, and {{is divided into}} two phases: induction and postremission (or consolidation) therapy. The goal of induction therapy is to achieve a complete remission by reducing the number of leukemic cells to an undetectable level; the goal of consolidation therapy <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> any residual undetectable disease and achieve a cure. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is usually considered if induction chemotherapy fails or after a person relapses, although transplantation is also sometimes used as front-line therapy for people with high-risk disease. Efforts to use tyrosine kinase inhibitors in AML continue.|$|E

5|$|In Angry Birds, {{the player}} {{controls}} {{a flock of}} multi-colored birds that are attempting to retrieve their eggs, which have been stolen {{by a group of}} hungry green pigs. In each stage of the gameplay, enemy pigs are sheltered by structures made of various materials such as wood, glass, and stone resembling children's toy building blocks. The objective of the game <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> all the pigs on the level. Using a slingshot, players launch a limited set of birds with the goal of either striking the enemy pigs directly or damaging their surrounding structures, causing the blocks to collapse and squash the pigs. The player must set the angle and force of the bird's travel by pulling back on the slingshot (using intuitive touch-controls in the mobile versions). The launch process is quick and casual, with no visible trajectory data, and a player simply selects a point in the X-Y field behind the launch post from which the virtual slingshot will be released. In various stages of the game, additional objects such as TNT crates and rocks are incorporated into the structures, and power-ups may be used to enhance the birds to attack hard-to-reach pigs.|$|E

5|$|Odin Sphere is a {{two-dimensional}} (2D) side-scrolling action role-playing game where the player takes control of five different characters across six playable scenarios. Areas within levels are circular stages allowing movement {{left or right}} with exits leading to other areas; the main goal in each area <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> all enemies and proceed to the next area. Combat—which uses a beat em up-style battle system—takes place within these areas, and revolves around the player character {{using a combination of}} physical attacks and Psypher skills, skills tied to each character's magical weapon. Combination attacks are triggered by attacking enemies continuously. Jumping can be used to reach airborne enemies within stages. At the end of each battle, grades are awarded based on the battle time, damage taken from enemies, and the amount of damage dealt. The amount of in-game currency the player receives as a reward after each battle depends on the battle grade.|$|E

Responsibility for this work would probably fall on the highway agencies which nearly all face difficulties in funding, manpower, and available time. Implementing and maintaining VII systems may therefore require support at the national level.|$|E
25|$|In many cases, {{we believe}} that {{individuals}} like to view themselves as noble by offering help. This concept {{is related to the}} notion of self-awareness. If it is true that people focus on the impression they make on others, then public-awareness through the use of accountability cues can stimulate people to give help to each other. However, being surrounded by a lot of bystanders does not automatically create public self-awareness. In fact, in some cases being surrounded by bystanders allows an individual to hide within the crowd and feel anonymous. According to Dr. van Bommel, by introducing an accountability cue, the aim <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> feelings of anonymity and increase the likelihood of them offering help.|$|E
25|$|Hawk-Eye {{is one of}} the {{goal-line}} technology (GLT) systems authorised by FIFA. Hawk-eye {{tracks the}} ball, and informs the referee if a ball fully crosses the goal line into the goal. The purpose of the system <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> errors in assessing if a goal was scored. The Hawk-eye system was one of the systems trialed by the sport's governors prior to the 2012 change to the Laws of the Game that made GLT a permanent part of the game, and it has been used in various competitions since then. GLT is not compulsory. and, owing to the cost of Hawk-Eye and its competitors, systems are only deployed in a few high-level competitions.|$|E

25|$|Battlefront II is {{fundamentally}} similar to its predecessor, albeit {{with the addition}} of new gameplay mechanics. The general objective in most missions <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> the enemy faction. Like its predecessor Star Wars Battlefront, the game is split into two eras: the Clone Wars, with battles taking place between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, and the Galactic Civil War, where battles between the Rebel Alliance and Galactic Empire take place. Players have the ability to choose between six classes during gameplay. Four class types are common to all factions; infantry, heavy weapon, sniper and engineer. In addition to the four standard classes, each faction has two unique classes which unlock by scoring a predetermined number of points. For the Rebellion faction, the Bothan Spy and the Wookiee; for the Empire, The Officer and The Dark Trooper; for the Republic, the Commander and the Jet Trooper; and for the CIS, the Magnaguard and the Droideka. Battlefront II also features heroes - a special class that allows the player to control iconic characters from the Star Wars universe. Heroes serve as a bonus to players, and are unlocked by meeting certain criteria, such as earning a certain number of points. Differences between Battlefront II and its predecessor include the ability to sprint and the ability to roll forwards. In addition to utilizing heroes in conquest matches, the game also features a hero assault mode in which heroes are pitted against villains in a team deathmatch format.|$|E
