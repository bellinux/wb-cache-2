25|$|Caffeine is also {{a common}} {{ingredient}} of soft drinks, such as cola, originally prepared from kola nuts. Soft drinks typically contain 0 to 55 milligrams of caffeine per 12 ounce serving. By contrast, energy drinks, such as Red Bull, can start at 80 milligrams of caffeine per serving. The caffeine in these drinks either originates from the ingredients used or is an additive derived from the product of decaffeination or from chemical synthesis. Guarana, a prime ingredient of energy drinks, contains large amounts of caffeine with small amounts of theobromine and theophylline in a naturally occurring slow-release <b>excipient.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mannitol {{increases}} {{blood glucose}} {{to a lesser}} extent than sucrose (thus having a relatively low glycemic index) so is used as a sweetener for people with diabetes, and in chewing gums. Although mannitol has a higher heat of solution than most sugar alcohols, its comparatively low solubility reduces the cooling effect usually found in mint candies and gums. However, when mannitol is completely dissolved in a product, it induces a strong cooling effect. Also, it has a very low hygroscopicity – it does not pick up water from the air until the humidity level is 98%. This makes mannitol very useful as a coating for hard candies, dried fruits, and chewing gums, and it is often included as an ingredient in candies and chewing gum. The pleasant taste and mouthfeel of mannitol also makes it a popular <b>excipient</b> for chewable tablets.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of drug products for pediatric use often requires age-appropriate formulations {{which can be}} more complex and may involve {{a broader range of}} <b>excipients</b> than adult dosage forms. <b>Excipients</b> established for adult use are not always appropriate for use in children because they can affect children differently than adults. Therefore, a comprehensive safety assessment of the <b>excipients</b> in a pediatric formulation is essential before use, referring to existing safety data from adult human and animals as well as safety data from pediatric use and juvenile toxicity studies, when available. The overall risk assessment needs to consider the safety risk from the <b>excipients</b> {{and the extent to which}} the risk from the disease as such will be ameliorated by the drug formulation. Non-clinical safety studies in juvenile animals are used to assess for specific toxicities or sensitivities of <b>excipients</b> and for establishing safe exposures in pediatric age groups. As for any active ingredient, non-clinical safety studies in juvenile animals should only be performed for <b>excipients</b> if important for clinical risk assessment and labelling.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effect of hydroxyl group containing tablet <b>excipients</b> on the duration of adhesion of mucoadhesive polymers, discs containing Carbopol 934 (C 934), polycarbophil (PC), sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC), tragacanth (trag.) and sodium alginate (Na alg.), either alone or {{in the presence of}} various amounts of <b>excipients</b> were prepared. The duration of adhesion of the prepared discs were determined in pH 7. 0 phosphate buffer at 37 °C.

Among the <b>excipients</b> tested, spray-dried lactose produced the greatest reduction in the duration of adhesion, followed by polyethylene glycol 6000 and pregelatinized starch. The smallest reduction in the adhesive properties of the test polymers was due to talc powder.

40|$|Traditionally most {{pharmaceutical}} <b>excipients</b> {{used for}} peroral dosage forms {{have been considered}} to be inert, although they {{have been known to}} play an important role in governing the release of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) required for the desired therapeutic effect.

In this way, <b>excipients</b> could be altering the overall ADMET properties of an incorporated drug thereby affecting its intended therapeutic efficacy and/or enhancing adverse side effects. Therefore, given this recent evidence, it seems necessary to review what has been reported in the literature on interactions of <b>excipients</b> with human physiological entities, particularly transporters. As of today, safety/toxicity evaluations are typically based on the appearance of gross morphological changes rather than the effects on a cellular level, the ability of <b>excipients</b> in modifying the pharmacological activity of an active drug could lead to toxicity evaluation in routine for each additive used in oral formulations.

The <b>excipients</b> were evaluated alone, in combinations and post-compression into compacts.   Preliminary experiments included density, hardness, friability and disintegration on all of the selected <b>excipients.</b> Based on such experiments {{it was found that the}} flowability of combination powders was more acceptable than individual <b>excipients.</b> Two combinations of microcrystalline -starch and microcrystalline cellulose -calcium carbonate granules were selected to be compressed with active ketoprofen pellets. In all the combinations used there was a significant amount of damage to drug pellets.   The kinetics of drug release appears to follow the zero-order rate and the rate remained unchanged even when a significant degree of damage to pellets occur. It was found that a high level of <b>excipients</b> is required in order to prepare microspheres as a rapid disintegrating tablet.
