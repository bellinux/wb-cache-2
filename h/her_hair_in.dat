5|$|The nude {{female figure}} is realistically sculpted in high-relief. Her eyes, beneath distinct, joined eyebrows, are hollow, presumably to accept some {{inlaying}} material– a feature common in stone, alabaster, and bronze sculptures of the time, but {{not seen in}} other Mesopotamian clay sculptures. Her full lips are slightly upturned at the corners. She is adorned with a four-tiered headdress of horns, topped by a disk. Her head is framed by two braids of hair, with the bulk of <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>in</b> a bun {{in the back and}} two wedge-shaped braids extending onto her breasts.|$|E
5|$|The visual {{opens with}} Stan moving out her jacket, while wearing a blonde wig. Subsequently, a {{mountain}} is presented, following which the singer is portrayed with a husky dog {{in front of}} a snowy landscape, sporting a white hoodie. Following this, footage with two horses running free is shown, with her tossing <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>in</b> a similar way to the animals' shakes. Over the rest of the music video, Stan further performs to the song, while band Havana make a cameo appearance and are seen in several scenes interspersed through the clip.|$|E
5|$|Ally then sings as {{she lays}} in the sand, moving sensually as an {{attractive}} man {{comes out of}} the water towards her. The camera fades to Lauren, who sings the bridge as she stands next to a background of rocks, as a take of another man is shown. The group is then scattered in different spots standing in a large rock formation, where shots of Dinah alone are spliced as she sings the chorus. Normani shares the chorus, as she sings on top of the rock cliff, shown earlier in the video. Camila seductively lays down and grabs <b>her</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>in</b> similarity to Ally. Several men approach the girls as they arrive in a convertible Jeep Wrangler. They greet and socialize with each other.|$|E

5|$|Hoshino {{thought that}} in a Victorian setting, {{long-haired}} girls tended to become the central character. After considering this, she believed a short-haired girl would stand out more and be much cuter. However, her editor wanted the character to have long hair, believing this would be better received by readers. As a result, Lenalee has long hair in the early chapters of the manga. Nevertheless, Hoshino took advantage of Lenalee's fight against the Level 3 Akuma to generate an impact strong enough to cause her to lose some of <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>in</b> the process. Hoshino paid the most attention to Lenalee's uniform wanting to design clothing that would be sexually appealing. As a result, her uniform included a mini-skirt. However, Hoshino notes that the design does not fit with the manga's setting and states that {{it is best to}} treat Lenalee's uniform as fan service.|$|E
5|$|During her {{shows at}} the Tokyo Dome during 1996, Carey sported a long and wavy hairstyle, while wearing a long black gown. She sang the {{original}} version of the song, up until halfway through the last chorus, until merging into the C+C remix. Several background vocalists were once again featured on stage, all donning black garbs. However, once the remix began, six male dancers {{made their way to}} the right and left sides of the stage, performing heavy dance routines as Carey walked around the stage. Once the remix began, the lighting was altered. Aside from the usual fluorescent lighting that was used throughout the show, additional pink and purple lighting was added for the number, as it served for the shows closing and final song. During her succeeding shows in Europe, Carey's outfits altered as well as her hairstyle. She wore a long, white strapless gown and sported <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>in</b> a straightened ponytail style. Since 1996, Carey has not performed the song live on television or on her tours.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was filmed and {{directed}} by Howard Greenhalgh on 10 November 1997 in a studio located in London. The video features each Spice Girl in their own individual scene, inspired by their own movie fantasies. Melanie Brown is shown singing {{on top of a}} tank strapped with ammunition in an industrial post-apocalyptic war scene in a segment based on the film Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. Emma Bunton is shown in a bedroom dressed in white pyjamas while objects float around her on their own; her scene is based on Poltergeist. Melanie Chisholm is shown in a Chinatown, dressed in a red cheongsam and black pants with <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>in</b> a long ponytail with red streaks; her scene is based upon Year of the Dragon. Geri Halliwell is featured in a black-and-white scene based on Rita Hayworth's performance in Gilda.

Victoria Beckham is shown in a missile silo next to a smoking rocket, clad in a black catsuit and with a long ponytail; she is portraying Catwoman from Batman Returns.|$|E

25|$|While in {{the past}} kokoshnik styles varied greatly, {{currently}} a kokoshnik is generally associated with a tall, nimbus or crest shaped headdress which is tied {{at the back of}} the head with long thick ribbons in a large bow. The crest can be embroidered with pearls and goldwork or simple applique, usually using plant and flower motifs. The forehead area is frequently decorated with pearl netting. While wearing a kokoshnik the woman usually wears <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>in</b> a plait. It resembles the French hood worn in Tudor England, but without the black veil.|$|E

25|$|It was {{revealed}} that Elisabeth and her children were more traumatized than previously thought. During captivity, Kerstin tore out <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>in</b> clumps, and {{was reported to have}} shredded her dresses before stuffing them in the toilet. Stefan could not walk properly, because of his height of , which had forced him to stoop in the -high cellar. It has also been revealed that normal everyday occurrences, such as the dimming of lights or the closing of doors, plunge Kerstin and Stefan into anxiety and panic attacks. The other three of Elisabeth's children who were raised by their father are being treated for anger and resentment at the events.|$|E
25|$|Many {{similarities}} {{exist between}} the burial of the mummies and some present-day Lebanese burials. For example, one of the infants had long strands of hair between its toes. According to local tradition {{in some areas of}} Lebanon today, a mother whose child dies will pull out <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>in</b> lamentation while kissing the feet of her deceased child. Similarly, today in Lebanon, when the last member of a family dies, the key to the family house is thrown over the roof, indicating that no one will live in the house again. The presence of a key in the 'Asi-al Hadath cave may also indicate that the last member of a family had died there as well.|$|E
25|$|She {{played a}} {{reckless}} socialite in Coquette (1929), {{a role for}} which her famous ringlets were cut into a 1920s' bob. Pickford had already cut <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>in</b> the wake of her mother's death in 1928. Fans were shocked at the transformation. Pickford's hair had {{become a symbol of}} female virtue, and when she cut it, the act made front-page news in The New York Times and other papers. Coquette was a success and won her an Academy Award for Best Actress, although this was highly controversial. The public failed to respond to her in the more sophisticated roles. Like most movie stars of the silent era, Pickford found her career fading as talkies became more popular among audiences.|$|E

Miss Rosetta had seen him coming down the long red hill, but she had not {{supposed}} he would be calling {{at that time of}} the morning. So she had not run. Miss Rosetta always ran if anybody called and <b>her</b> front <b>hair</b> was <b>in</b> curl-papers; and, though the errand of the said caller might be life or death, he or she had to wait until Miss Rosetta had taken <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> out. Everybody <b>in</b> Avonlea knew this, because everybody in Avonlea knew everything about everybody else.|$|R

25|$|As a child, Kelis sang {{in church}} choirs and played violin, piano, and {{saxophone}} while attending Manhattan Country School, a private school. At {{the age of}} 13, Kelis shaved off all of <b>her</b> <b>hair.</b> <b>In</b> an interview with Charlotte Roche, Kelis says she {{was kicked out of}} her parents' house at the age of sixteen for bad behavior, stating that she would sometimes clash with her mother, but continued her education at the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, where she formed the R trio BLU (Black Ladies United). Kelis was also a bartender and a sales associate at a clothing store before graduating high school. Afterwards, a friend introduced Kelis to The Neptunes (Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo); they formed a strong bond, and, with their support, she landed a record deal with Virgin Records.|$|E
