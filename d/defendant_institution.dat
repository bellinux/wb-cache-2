In Chapter III, however, always taking as a benchmark the case of international corruption, we will analyze the legislation on precautionary measures.

40|$|This chapter {{provides}} a concise and up-to-date {{synthesis of the}} published case law where a student teacher was the plaintiff, the <b>defendant</b> was an <b>institution</b> of higher education or cooperating local school district, and the issues in dispute were related to diversity. The number of such court decisions was surprisingly small, and the outcomes generally favored the <b>defendant</b> <b>institutions.</b> The court cases fall under three categories: 1) student teachers’ diverse views on religion, 2) student teachers’ diverse forms of free speech, and 3) student teachers with special needs. Constitutional claims were the predominant avenue of litigation against school districts and those {{institutions of higher education}} that were public, whereas breach of contract was the primary claim against private higher education institutions. Helping to fill a gap in the professional literature for both students and educational institutions, this chapter serves as a step forward for institutional policies and practices of preventive law and provides case study material based on published precedents for teacher preparation programs. Additionally, it {{provides a}}n opportunity for renaissance in the field of education...|$|R
40|$|I. Introduction Despite the {{promises}} of equal opportunity for women signalled by the passage of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX), 1 little progress in the creditable realization of this goal occurred in intercollegiate or interscholastic athletics between 1972 and 1992. 2 This lack of progress was unfortunate. 3 In many ways, most women {{were still on the}} sidelines. However, recent judicial decisions have allowed many, but certainly not all, women to leave the sidelines and enter the playing fields as equals. By virtue of three landmark cases, Cohen v. Brown, 4 Roberts v. Colorado State Board of Agriculture, 5 and Favia v. Indiana University of Pennsylvania, 6 women who are blessed with great athletic ability have earned a mandate for nu- merical parity with men in intercollegiate athletic programs. In these three cases, federal district courts issued injunctions to prevent post-secondary institutions from eliminating certain women 2 ̆ 7 s intercollegiate athletic teams, 7 or reducing them to a lower level status. 8 Every decision was affirmed on appeal. 9 The various courts held that the <b>defendant</b> <b>institutions</b> {{in each of the three}} cases had engaged in gender discrimination, prohibited by Title IX, 10 by failing to meet any one of three alternative measures established in the Policy Interpretation. 11 These three measures, which are designed to be considered consecutively, attempt to provide for assessment of the opportu- nity for individuals of both genders to compete in athletic programs by de- termining: 1.

40|$|Suppose {{you run a}} small {{corporation}} {{in the business of}} auctioneering stamps, coins, and other collectibles. Sensing that your corporation’s financial prospects are on the decline, large financial institutions drive the price of the company’s stock down. Your shareholders sue in state court alleging a breach of state law in manipulating stock prices while also referencing breaches of federal securities law. Can the <b>defendant</b> financial <b>institutions</b> remove the case to federal court? This question is set to be answered by the Supreme Court in Manning v. Merrill Lynch, which deals specifically with whether section 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 allows defendants to remove a case to federal court when the plaintiff brings state-law claims in state court, but references violations of a related federal regulation. In Manning, the Supreme Court has an opportunity to resolve several circuit splits at once by deciding how the removal provisions of section 27 should be construed relative to the general federal question jurisdiction statute. This Commentary urges the Court to hold that the requirement of section 1331 is a necessary prerequisite to the triggering of any exclusive jurisdiction provision. This holding would prevent wholly state-law claims brought in state court from being removed to federal court, thereby preserving the federal-state balance that Congress intended to create through the Exchange Act...|$|R
40|$|This {{essay is}} about the {{language}} used to decide when governments should {{be held responsible for}} constitutional torts. 2 ̆ 7 Debate about what is required of government officials, and what is required of government itself, is scarcely new. What is new, at least to American jurisprudence, is litigation against government units (rather than government officials) for constitutional injuries. 2 The extension of liability to institutional defendants introduces special problems for the language of responsibility. In a suit against an individual official it is easy to describe the wrong as the consequence of individual behavior that is inconsistent with community norms; the language of common-law tort, which refers explicitly to those norms, has seemed to provide a useful starting point for evaluating that behavior. 3 When the <b>defendant</b> is an <b>institution,</b> the language of tort provides no such ground because traditionally it has not been used to evaluate harms created by structures and contexts rather than by individuals. When discussions of institutional responsibility are couched only in terms borrowed from tort they are impoverished. The poverty of discussions cast in tort vocabulary can even be read to suggest that we simply have no norms for risk-creating behavior other than those applied to individuals. I begin with a discussion of the language of responsibility as it has been developed in tort for tracing the consequences of individual behavior. Suits against institutions have been assimilated to this language through the doctrines of vicarious and strict liability. In constitutional tort litigation, however, these doctrines are not available, and the problem of institutional responsibility must be faced directly. I then discuss a series of constitutional tort cases - those cases in which the Supreme Court has elaborated the conditions under which government liability will be imposed - in order to investigate this problem of language. In these cases the perspective adopted from tort encourages the Justices to convert the problem of institutional morality into one of individual morality; tort language leads them to look for individual choices and motives, for an actor or a 2 ̆ 2 mind 2 ̆ 2 that can be evaluated. In most of these cases the possibility of looking at an institution as a unit distinct from the separate individuals who compose it is not considered. For example, the Justices fail to see that injuries can be brought about quite inadvertently through the workings of institutional structures - through the massing or fragmentation of authority, or by the creation of a culture in which responses and a sense of responsibility are distorted. Finally, I point to a few cases in which the Supreme Court has, perhaps inadvertently, considered the institution as a whole in determining whether constitutional norms have been violated and liability is appropriate. One of these, Owen v. City of Independence, 4 like the cases discussed earlier, raises the issue of what is 2 ̆ 2 official policy or custom. 2 ̆ 2 The others, Parratt v. Taylor 5 and Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 6 involve due process. We shall see that the promise of the due process cases has not been fulfiled. The pull of the individual tort model has proved too strong, leading the Court to retreat from the structural analysis employed in Parratt...|$|R
