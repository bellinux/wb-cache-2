5|$|Initially, {{the group}} wanted to release an album cover using an edited <b>image</b> <b>from</b> a Holy Communion card, showing {{children}} joining hands. The image had been photocopied several times, {{so it had}} become distorted. The art direction was by John Maybury, a college friend of Morris. Their manager, Stevenson, was unable to determine who owned the copyright and advised that the band would be bankrupted if they were sued as a result. Polydor also became nervous about copyright infringement, so the artwork was pulled at the last minute; the record company's executives also disliked its religious nature. A UK tour had already been scheduled {{to coincide with the}} release of the album, so there was no possibility of delaying the release.|$|E

5|$|Melanie {{was created}} by {{producer}} Mara Brock Akil. While casting the character, Brock Akil had doubts about whether Mowry {{would be the best}} choice, given her wholesome <b>image</b> <b>from</b> starring as Tia Landry on the sitcom Sister, Sister, but hired the actress based on her strong work ethic and her desire {{to be part of the}} series. Mowry considered the character to be her first adult role and felt it emphasized her individuality and maturity. She identified closely with the part, observing parallels between Melanie's relationship with Derwin and her own marriage to actor Cory Hardrict. She cited The Game as an example of women receiving more lead roles on television.|$|E
5|$|Stuart William Morgan, a 36-year-old {{lorry driver}} from Poole, Dorset, {{was arrested in}} February 1996 after a {{colleague}} recognised his <b>image</b> <b>from</b> a photofit. Morgan was later charged with Figard's murder, and convicted in October. Detectives concluded that after raping, strangling and bludgeoning her, he carried her body in his vehicle for ten days over the Christmas period before dumping it. Morgan was given a life sentence, with a recommendation to serve at least twenty years. An appeal in February 1998 {{was rejected by the}} Court of Appeal, and in 2009 the High Court turned down his application for a review of the length of his sentence. He became eligible for parole in February 2016, and has continued to maintain his innocence.|$|E
5|$|The cover also {{features}} a blue dragon eating a human, the design {{of which was a}} direct reference to the sea serpent <b>image</b> <b>from</b> Olaus Magnus's book History of the Northern Peoples. The use of a dragon eating a man is to symbolise former member Hester being consumed by depression, symbolised by the dragon being blue, and this brought his time on earth to an early end. The cover art is almost completely composed of newspaper cuttings collaged together, even the image of the man and the dragon are newspaper cuttings which Seymour painted onto. Only the tree on the right, and the title text are not composed of newspaper cuttings. The tree is to pose as a simile for the tree under which Hester took his life in 2005.|$|E

5|$|Andrée {{resisted}} Ekholm's criticisms to {{the point}} of deception. On the boat back from Svalbard, Ekholm learned from the chief engineer of the hydrogen plant the explanation of some anomalies he had noticed in his measurements: Andrée had from time to time secretly ordered extra topping-up of the hydrogen in the balloon. Andrée's motives for such self-destructive behavior are not known. Several modern writers, following Sundman's Andrée portrait in the semi-documentary novel, The Flight of the Eagle (1967), have speculated that Andrée had by this time become the prisoner of his own successful funding campaign. The sponsors and the media followed every delay and reported on every setback, and were clamoring for results. Andrée, Strindberg, and Ekholm had been seen off by cheering crowds in Stockholm and Gothenburg (see <b>image</b> <b>from</b> Aftonbladet, right), and now all the expectations were coming to nothing with the long wait for southerly winds at Danes Island. Especially pointed was the contrast between Nansen's simultaneous return, covered in polar glory from his daring yet well-planned expedition on the ship Fram, and Andrée's failure even to launch his own much-hyped conveyance. Sundman theorizes that Andrée could not face letting the press report {{that he did not know}} the prevailing wind direction, and had also miscalculated in ordering the balloon, and needed a new one to rectify his error.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} promote Rock 'n' Roll Circus, Hamasaki {{conducted}} several commercial endorsement opportunities and expanded several other ventures. Hamasaki opened two special websites to document her preparation for the Rock 'n' Roll Circus concert tour, and additional promotional activity.

Hamasaki also received exclusive deals to promote Rock 'n' Roll Circus through mobile phones, including the Japanese services SNS and Utapiku. One day after the album's domestic release, Hamasaki began expanding her online presence by setting up accounts on MySpace, Ustream, and Twitter to promote the album and interact with her fan base.

30|$|The K 8 and Ki 67 {{expression}} {{levels in}} treated and untreated NCI-H 69 SCLC and GOT 1 midgut tumour xenograft sections were quantified by analysing DAB staining with the ImageJ programme {{developed by the}} National Institute of Health [40]. The immunoRatio plugin of the programme measured the DAB (brown) and nuclei haematoxylin (blue) stains with an image resolution of 6.24 pixels/μm. Areas of 320 × 250 μm were analysed with the same light filter settings for each section. The imaged areas with tumour cells were randomly chosen, but areas of necrosis larger than 50 × 50 μm and mouse cells only were avoided. We analysed a total of 145 <b>images</b> <b>from</b> five, untreated SCLC tumour xenografts; 37 <b>images</b> <b>from</b> three, 1 -day-treated, SCLC tumours; 74 <b>images</b> <b>from</b> four, 5 -day-treated, SCLC tumours; 75 <b>images</b> <b>from</b> three, 12 -day-treated, SCLC tumours; 33 <b>images</b> <b>from</b> two, 20 -day-treated, SCLC tumours; and 57 <b>images</b> <b>from</b> three, regrown SCLC tumours. For the GOT 1 tumour xenografts, we analysed 63 <b>images</b> <b>from</b> three, untreated tumours and 83 <b>images</b> <b>from</b> four, 3 -day-treated tumours. Between 10 and 40 sections from each group of SCLC and GOT 1 xenografts were stained with Ki 67 and similarly analysed. The mean percentages and standard deviations were calculated for K 8 and Ki 67 DAB stains. The results were compared with two-sided Students t tests and the significance level was set at P < 0.05.|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} Varaha {{images are}} found in Mathura, dating to the 1st and 2nd century CE. The cult of Varaha {{seems to have been}} popular in the Gupta era (4th-6th century) in Central India, considering the large number of Varaha sculptures and inscriptions found. A red sandstone sculpture of Varaha in boar form with an inscription is traced to the reign of Toramana (late 5th to early 6th century CE). Early sculptures of Varaha generally depict him in his boar form. Anthropomorphic depictions of Varaha with human body and boar’s head become popular in the later period. Other early sculptures exist in the cave temples in Badami in Karnataka (6th century) and Varaha Cave Temple in Mahabalipuram (7th century); both in South India and Ellora Caves (7th century) in Western India. In the Udayagiri Caves (Cave 5) in Madhya Pradesh, an image of Varaha rescuing the earth sculpted in sandstone (dated to 401-450 CE) is seen; and a zoomoriphic <b>image</b> <b>from</b> 8th century from Bago-Pathari is now with the Archeological Museum at Gwalior. By 7th century, images of Varaha were found in all regions of India. By the 10th century, temples dedicated to Varaha were established in Khajuraho (existent, but worship has ceased), Udaipur, Jhansi (now in ruins) etc.|$|E
