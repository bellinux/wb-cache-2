5|$|Contrary to U.S. Army {{regulations}} as well, {{no charges}} were ever filed against Stone {{nor did he}} stand trial. While he was in solitary confinement at Fort Lafayette, he could not <b>exercise,</b> <b>and</b> consequently Stone's health began to degrade. His physicians protested heavily to Stanton, who ordered him transferred to the military prison at Fort Hamilton. There Stone was allowed to <b>exercise</b> <b>and</b> his condition improved. He stayed at Fort Lafayette for fifty days, and would spend another 139 in Fort Hamilton. Stone was finally released without explanation or apology on August 16, 1862. The reason for his release was new legislation written by California Senator James A. McDougall. In a small addition to another bill, McDougall reiterated the Articles of War requirement that official charges be filed within eight days of arrest, but went on to include that any imprisoned officer must be given their trial within thirty days. McDougall also made it clear this legislation applied to those currently under arrest, which covered Stone's case. It passed the U.S. Congress and {{was signed into law}} by President Lincoln on July 17, 1862. Stanton then waited the thirty days before releasing Stone.|$|E

It is unclear whether metformin slowed down the progression of prediabetes to diabetes (true preventive effect), or the decrease of diabetes in the treated population was simply due to its glucose-lowering action (treatment effect).|$|E
