5|$|Commentators {{attributed}} the mismanagement behind Enron’s fall {{to a variety}} of ethical and political-economic causes. Ethical explanations centered on executive greed and <b>hubris,</b> a lack of corporate social responsibility, situation ethics, and get-it-done business pragmatism. Political-economic explanations cited post-1970s deregulation, and inadequate staff and funding for regulatory oversight. A more libertarian analysis maintained that Enron’s collapse resulted from the company’s reliance on political lobbying, rent-seeking, and the gaming of regulations.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} {{has also}} {{become something of a}} cultural symbol representative of the North American video game crash of 1983, often cited as a cautionary tale about the <b>hubris</b> of poor business practices, despite suggestions that the burial allowed the company to write off the disposed-of material for tax relief purposes.|$|E
5|$|During the voyages, Volsius reappears in {{the guise}} of Georges's heroes: Otto Lidenbrock {{at the center of the}} earth, Captain Nemo on a journey on the Nautilus to Atlantis, and Michel Ardan on a cannon-propelled trip to a distant planet, Altor. Ox and Volsius are in {{constant}} conflict throughout, with the former urging Georges toward <b>hubris</b> and the latter seeking to protect Georges from the influence. Ox appears to have won at the climax of the play, when Georges—attempting to work for the benefit of Altor, where overconsumption has deprived the planet of soil and other natural resources—leads a massive technological project to save the planet from burning by redirecting its water channels. The project backfires, and the planet explodes.|$|E
5|$|The film {{operates}} on multiple dramatic and narrative levels. It employs {{some of the}} conventions of film noir, among them {{the character of a}} femme fatale; narration by the protagonist (in the original release); chiaroscuro cinematography; and giving the hero a questionable moral outlook—extended to include reflections upon the nature of his own humanity. It is a literate science fiction film, thematically enfolding the philosophy of religion and moral implications of human mastery of genetic engineering in the context of classical Greek drama and <b>hubris.</b> It also draws on Biblical images, such as Noah's flood, and literary sources, such as Frankenstein. Linguistically, the theme of mortality is subtly reiterated in the chess game between Sebastian and Tyrell, supposedly based on the famous Immortal Game of 1851 (though Scott has said this was merely coincidental).|$|E
5|$|Incest and {{intersex}} {{is another}} theme in Middlesex. Eugenides examines the passionate feelings that siblings living in seclusion experience for each other. Milton and Tessie, second cousins, are conceived {{during the same}} night, hinting to the incest of Desdemona and Lefty. Desdemona and Lefty's incestuous relationship is a transgression of a powerful taboo, indicating that someone will suffer for their wrongs; in a way, Cal's intersex condition symbolizes this Greek <b>hubris.</b> In another incestuous relationship, Milton makes love to Tessie using a clarinet which he lovingly rubs against her; their incestuous relationship enables them to contribute mutated genes to their child Cal. Cal's mother interferes with fate by attempting to make her second child a daughter. Cal believes this interference {{was a factor in}} his being a hermaphrodite. Conversely, Cal's relationship with his brother, ChapterEleven, is indicative of the possible dissimilarities that are products of the biosocial.|$|E
5|$|Varro, {{in command}} {{on the first}} day, is {{presented}} by contemporary sources {{as a man of}} reckless nature and <b>hubris,</b> who was determined to defeat Hannibal. While the Romans were approaching Cannae, a small portion of Hannibal's forces ambushed them. Varro repelled the attack and continued on his way to Cannae. This victory, though essentially a mere skirmish with no lasting strategic value, greatly bolstered the confidence of the Roman army, perhaps leading to overconfidence on Varro's part. Paullus, however, was opposed to the engagement as it was taking shape. Unlike Varro, he was prudent and cautious, and he believed it was foolish to fight on open ground, despite the Romans' numerical strength. This was especially true since Hannibal held the advantage in cavalry (both in quality and quantity). Despite these misgivings, Paullus thought it unwise to withdraw the army after the initial success, and camped two-thirds of the army east of the Aufidus River, sending the remainder to fortify a position on the opposite side. The purpose of this second camp was to cover the foraging parties from the main camp and harass those of the enemy.|$|E
5|$|En {{route to}} the Sea of Monsters (Bermuda triangle), the Birmingham is {{destroyed}} by Charybdis and Scylla. Thinking Tyson and Clarisse dead, Percy and Annabeth sail in a lifeboat to a nearby island, where they narrowly escape the sorceress Circe, who turns men into guinea pigs. They steal the Queen Anne's Revenge from Circe's harbor and sail towards the island of Polyphemus. Along the way, they pass the island of the Sirens and Annabeth confesses her fatal flaw, <b>hubris,</b> to Percy. When they reach the island, they find Grover, Clarisse, Tyson, and the fleece. Tyson and Percy work together to defeat Polyphemus and return the group to the mainland. Once there, Clarisse takes a plane to Camp Half-Blood with the Fleece. The remaining questers are captured by Luke and taken to the Princess Andromeda. Percy manages to contact Camp Half-Blood through an Iris Message and tricks Luke into admitting that he poisoned Thalia's tree, proving Chiron's innocence {{in front of the}} entire camp. Mr. D then sends Tantalus back to the Fields of Punishment. Luke duels Percy, beats him, and is about to kill the group, but before he does, Chiron and the his centaur relatives appear and rescue them. Returning to the camp, Chiron is given his job back and the Golden Fleece heals Thalia's tree. However, in the final pages, the Golden Fleece also revives Thalia Grace, putting another half-blood back into play for the Great Prophecy the gods fear so much.|$|E
5|$|Just as the Jeddah Tower will {{complement}} the Jeddah Economic City development {{that will be}} built around it, there are many infrastructure and revitalization projects underway and planned throughout Saudi Arabia, such as the US$7.2 billion (SR27.1 billion) new airport terminal under construction at King Abdulaziz (Jeddah) International Airport, that will {{complement the}} Jeddah Economic City as well as develop Saudi Arabia, which has been likened to a Third World country with crumbling infrastructure and widespread disasters, including severe flooding, such as the flash floods in early 2011 that damaged 90% of the roads and over 27,000 buildings in Jeddah. According to a representative of Standard Chartered, which invested US$75 million in Saudi Binladin Group, Saudi Arabia is going to spend over US$400 billion (SR1.5 trillion) on infrastructure {{over the next few}} years. According to reports by Citi Investment Research & Analysis, $220 billion worth of development, accounting for 36% of all construction spending in the MENA region, will be directly or indirectly beneficial to Jeddah Tower. Jeddah Tower and City themselves are intended to set an example of green development, using modern technology and having a low carbon footprint relative to the number of people they will support. However, there is also an increasing problem of poor education levels in Arab countries {{due to a lack of}} spending in research and education, which it is argued should be invested in rather than building skyscrapers, and that the tower is nothing more than a symbol of <b>hubris.</b> It has even been likened to the Tower of Babel.|$|E

25|$|Violations of the {{law against}} <b>hubris</b> {{included}} what might today be termed assault and battery; sexual crimes; or the theft of public or sacred property. Two well-known cases {{are found in the}} speeches of Demosthenes, a prominent statesman and orator in ancient Greece. These two examples occurred when first Midias punched Demosthenes in the face in the theatre (Against Midias), and second when (in Against Conon) a defendant allegedly assaulted a man and crowed over the victim. Yet another example of <b>hubris</b> appears in Aeschines' Against Timarchus, where the defendant, Timarchus, is accused of breaking the law of <b>hubris</b> by submitting himself to prostitution and anal intercourse. Aeschines brought this suit against Timarchus to bar him from the rights of political office and his case succeeded.|$|E
25|$|In Thrace, Hera and Zeus turned King Haemus and Queen Rhodope into mountains, the Balkan (Haemus Mons) and Rhodope Mountains respectively, {{for their}} <b>hubris</b> in {{comparing}} {{themselves to the}} gods.|$|E
25|$|In Greek mythology, when a figure's <b>hubris</b> offends the Gods {{of ancient}} Greece, {{it is usually}} punished; {{examples}} of such hubristic, sinful humans include Icarus, Phaethon, Arachne, Salmoneus, Niobe, Cassiopeia, and Tereus.|$|E
25|$|In ancient Greek, <b>hubris</b> {{referred}} to actions that shamed and humiliated the victim {{for the pleasure}} or gratification of the abuser. The term had a strong sexual connotation, and the shame reflected upon the perpetrator as well.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{view is that}} Satan on each {{occasion}} {{is trying}} to make Jesus commit a particular sin — avarice by offering power over the kingdoms of the world, gluttony by suggesting a way to relieve Jesus' hunger, and <b>hubris</b> by suggesting that Jesus jump and rely on angels to break his fall.|$|E
25|$|Humility, {{in various}} interpretations, is {{widely seen as}} a virtue which centers on low self-preoccupation, or unwillingness to put oneself forward, so it is in many {{religious}} and philosophical traditions, it contrasts with narcissism, <b>hubris</b> {{and other forms of}} pride and is an idealistic and rare intrinsic construct that has an extrinsic side.|$|E
25|$|Newspaper opinion editor Michael Young {{posits that}} Halberstam saw Vietnam {{as a moral}} tragedy, with America's <b>hubris</b> {{bringing}} about its downfall. Young writes that Halberstam reduced everything to human will, turning his subjects into agents of broader historical forces and coming off like a Hollywood movie with a fated and formulaic climax.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{critics argue}} that humans are adapted to the Universe {{through the process of}} evolution, rather than the Universe being adapted to humans (see puddle thinking, below). They also see it {{as an example of the}} logical flaw of <b>hubris</b> or anthropocentrism in its {{assertion}} that humans are the purpose of the Universe.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} of {{his plays}} to survive is The Persians (Persai), performed in 472 BC {{and based on}} experiences in Aeschylus's own life, specifically the Battle of Salamis. It is unique among surviving Greek tragedies in that it describes a recent historical event. The Persians focuses on the popular Greek theme of <b>hubris</b> by blaming Persia's loss on the pride of its king.|$|E
25|$|The Imperial gardens on {{the hill}} look over the {{surrounding}} green hills and valleys and the Ionian sea. The centrepiece of the gardens is a marble statue on a high pedestal, of the mortally wounded Achilles (Greek: Αχιλλεύς Θνήσκων, Achilleús Thnēskōn, Achilles Dying) without <b>hubris</b> and wearing only a simple cloth and an ancient Greek hoplite helmet. This statue was carved by German sculptor Ernst Gustav Herter.|$|E
25|$|Even {{in works}} {{that do not}} {{consciously}} draw on Graeco-Roman literature, authors often employ concepts and themes originating in ancient Greece. The ideas expressed in Aristotle's Poetics, in particular, have influenced generations of Western writers and literary critics. A Latin translation of an Arabic version of the Poetics by Averroes was available during the Middle Ages. Common Greek literary terms still used today include: catharsis, ethos, anagnorisis, hamartia, <b>hubris,</b> mimesis, mythos, nemesis, and peripeteia.|$|E
25|$|The {{notion of}} fusing horizons {{serves as a}} guiding model for {{therapeutic}} dialogue. Furthermore, this process necessitates {{the need for the}} therapist to allow what the client says to matter to him and even challenge what he believes. Instead of the therapist assuming the role of expert, he rids himself of any therapist <b>hubris</b> and shares authority with the client, therefore allowing for safe conversation and critical openness toward both counselor and client. By both remaining open, horizons from each party are mutually influenced.|$|E
25|$|Over time, the mages became {{filled with}} <b>hubris,</b> and began {{fighting}} over {{how best to}} lead the world. The battle separated the Earth into the Fallen World and the Supernal Realm, with the chasm of the Abyss in between. The Fallen World is the world where humanity now exists, and the Supernal realm is the realm of magic, where the victorious mages of long ago now reside. The Abyss that separates the two worlds prevents most of humanity from awakening to magic, and hampers the power of mages trapped in the Fallen World.|$|E
25|$|Further {{television}} roles followed, including {{parts in}} period dramas such as Emma and Jane Eyre. Emma was a film {{adaptation of the}} novel {{of the same name}} published in 1815 about youthful <b>hubris</b> and the perils of misconstrued romance. The movie received largely positive reviews from critics and was broadcast in late 1996 on ITV, garnering an estimated 12 million viewers. In Jane Eyre, Morton starred as a Yorkshire orphan who becomes a governess to a young French girl and finds love with the brooding lord of the manor. Like her previous small-screen projects, the 1997 film originally aired on ITV.|$|E
25|$|It {{opens with}} the arrival of a {{messenger}} in Susa, the Persian capital, bearing news of the catastrophic Persian defeat at Salamis to Atossa, the mother of the Persian King Xerxes. Atossa then travels to the tomb of Darius, her husband, where his ghost appears to explain the cause of the defeat. It is, he says, the result of Xerxes' <b>hubris</b> in building a bridge across the Hellespont, an action which angered the gods. Xerxes appears {{at the end of the}} play, not realizing the cause of his defeat, and the play closes to lamentations by Xerxes and the chorus.|$|E
25|$|Boromir's {{attempts}} {{to gain the}} Ring for himself {{have been described as}} well-intentioned but oblivious of the potential danger. His perception of Middle-earth is biased by a point of view that imagines that divine powers have chosen Gondor to lead the fight against evil. He is always eager to praise the great deeds of Gondor, including his own. When his <b>hubris</b> eventually leads him into attacking Frodo to seize the Ring, Boromir seals his own doom by giving in to the malign power of the Ring. He makes way thereby for Aragorn to become the future king of Gondor, {{in a manner similar to}} Virgil's character Turnus.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{standard}} modern text on the work, Lamar Ronald Lacey's The Myth of Aktaion: Literary and Iconographic Studies, the most likely original version of the myth is that Actaeon was the hunting companion of the goddess who, seeing her naked in her sacred spring, attempts to force himself on her. For this <b>hubris,</b> he is turned into a stag and devoured by his own hounds. However, in some surviving versions, Actaeon is a stranger who happens upon her. Different tellings also diverge in the hunter's transgression, which is sometimes merely seeing the virgin goddess naked, sometimes boasting he is a better hunter than she, or even merely being a rival of Zeus for the affections of Semele.|$|E
25|$|Sowell {{has also}} written a trilogy of books on {{ideologies}} and political positions, including A Conflict of Visions, where he speaks {{about the origins of}} political strife; The Vision of the Anointed, where he compares the conservative/libertarian and liberal/progressive worldviews; and The Quest for Cosmic Justice, where, as in many of his other writings, he outlines his thesis of the need for intellectuals, politicians and leaders to fix and perfect the world in utopian, and ultimately he posits, disastrous fashions. Separate from the trilogy, but also in discussion of the subject, he wrote Intellectuals and Society, where, building on his earlier work, he discusses what he argues to be the blind <b>hubris</b> and follies of intellectuals in a variety of areas.|$|E
25|$|In his {{connections}} with Inanna, Enki shows {{other aspects of}} his non-patriarchal nature. The myth Enki and Inanna {{tells the story of}} how the young goddess of the É-anna temple of Uruk feasts with her father Enki. The two deities compete against each other in a drinking competition. Then, Enki, thoroughly inebriated, gives Inanna all of the Mes, the gifts of civilized life. The next morning, when Enki awakes with a hangover, he asks his servant Isimud for the Mes, only to be informed that he has given them to Inanna. Upset at his actions, he sends Galla demons to recover them. Inanna sails away in the boat of heaven and arrives safely back at the quay at Uruk. Enki realises that he has been tricked in his <b>hubris</b> and accepts a peace treaty forever with Uruk.|$|E
25|$|To rouse public feeling {{against the}} Whigs and their European allies the Tories {{had turned to}} propaganda, notably Jonathan Swift's The Conduct of the Allies. In his {{pamphlet}} (composed with ministerial assistance) Swift protested against Allied intransigence at The Hague and Geertruidenberg peace talks, and he reminded the public of the original Treaty of Grand Alliance where no mention was made of driving Philip V from Spain. Swift lamented that the early Allied victories had led to <b>hubris</b> and intransigence, and he rejected the preoccupation with {{the security of the}} Low Countries at the expense of a naval and colonial war. He also denigrated Marlborough, a leading member of the former administration and opponent of the new ministry's direction who, now that the Preliminaries had been unilaterally agreed with France, was no longer needed. To further discredit the Duke charges of financial corruption during the war were lodged against him in Parliament, leading to his dismissal at the end of 1711.|$|E
25|$|According to Goenner, the {{contributions}} to the book are a mixture of mathematical–physical incompetence, <b>hubris,</b> and {{the feelings of the}} critics of being suppressed by contemporary physicists advocating for the new theory. The compilation of the authors show, Goenner continues, {{that this was not a}} reaction within the physics community—only one physicist (Karl Strehl) and three mathematicians (Jean-Marie Le Roux, Emanuel Lasker and Hjalmar Mellin) were present—but a reaction of an inadequately educated academic citizenship, which didn't know what to do with relativity. As regards the average age of the authors: 57% were substantially older than Einstein, one third was around the same age, and only two persons were substantially younger. Two authors (Reuterdahl, von Mitis) were antisemitic and four others were possibly connected to the Nazi movement. On the other hand, no antisemitic expression can be found in the book, and it also included contributions of some authors of Jewish ancestry (Salomo Friedländer, Ludwig Goldschmidt, Hans Israel, Emanuel Lasker, Oskar Kraus, Menyhért Palágyi).|$|E
500|$|Game {{designer}} Greg Costikyan has praised My Life with Master {{for the way}} it [...] "evokes {{emotions and}} feelings rare in games", and considers it to work {{in part because the}} Gothic horror theme has [...] "a defined narrative arc: <b>hubris</b> and terror, followed by a fall".|$|E
500|$|El-ahrairah: A rabbit trickster folk hero, who is {{the protagonist}} of {{nearly all of the}} rabbits' stories. He {{represents}} what every rabbit wants to be; smart, devious, tricky, and devoted to the well-being of his warren. In Lapine, his name is a contraction of the phrase Elil-hrair-rah, which means [...] "prince with a thousand enemies". His stories of cleverness (and excessive <b>hubris)</b> are very similar to Br'er Rabbit and Anansi. His name is pronounced with the same cadence as the phrase [...] "Never say die", thus, [...] "El-a-hrai-rah".|$|E
500|$|The reverential awe {{in which}} athletes {{were held in}} Greece led to exaggeration in the tales {{surrounding}} their lives. [...] In Milo's case, Aristotle (Ethica Nichomachea, II, 6 = 1106b) began the myth-making process with reports likening Milo unto Heracles in his enormous appetite, and Athenaeus (X, 412e-f) continued the process {{with the story of}} Milo carrying a bull—a feat also associated with Heracles. [...] It is Milo's sudden death which makes him most akin to the heroes: there is a hint of <b>hubris</b> in his attempt to rend the tree asunder, and striking contrast between his glorious athletic achievements and his sudden ignoble death.|$|E
500|$|Lamb of God toured for {{two years}} before {{releasing}} their third studio album, As the Palaces Burn, on May 6, 2003. Kirk Miller of Rolling Stone gave the album three out of five stars, writing that [...] "unlike many of their overreaching, Slipknot-influenced contemporaries, Lamb of God deliver a meticulously crafted metal assault." [...] The album was voted the number one album of 2003 by both Revolver Magazine and Metal Hammer. The band was part of the first Headbangers Ball tour, where they recorded a DVD including live performances and a documentary, titled Terror and <b>Hubris.</b> The DVD was a success, debuting at number 31 on the Billboard Top Music Videos chart.|$|E
500|$|Gooch {{believes}} there is a contradiction between Sadler's advocacy of science and reason and his support of the avant-garde theological, [...] "inter-planetary" [...] contents of The Urantia Book. Gardner describes Sadler's life story as [...] "riveting" [...] and summarizes him as an [...] "intelligent, gifted" [...] person who proved to be [...] "gullible" [...] about alleged supernatural revelations. He contends that Sadler eventually developed megalomania that was unrecognized by those around him and argues that Sadler succumbed to <b>hubris</b> and began {{to believe that he}} was a prophet, divinely chosen as the founder and leader of a new religion. Lewis disputes this characterization, maintaining that Sadler and those around him sought only to clarify and explain the teachings of the Bible.|$|E
500|$|Screenwriters Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely {{wanted to}} explore how the Pevensies felt after {{returning}} from Narnia, going from being kings and queens back to an awkward year as school children. They noted, [...] " [...] doesn't much consider {{what it would be}} like for a King of Narnia to return to being a 1940's schoolchild." [...] They also decided to introduce the Pevensies back into Narnia nearer the start, in order to weave the two separate stories of the Pevensies and Caspian, in contrast to the book's structure. A sense of guilt on the Pevensies' part was added, seeing the destruction of Narnia in their absence, as was <b>hubris</b> for Peter to enhance the theme of belief: his arrogance means he is unable to see Aslan.|$|E
