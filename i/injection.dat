5|$|Like all {{industrial}} processes, <b>injection</b> moulding {{can produce}} flawed parts. In {{the field of}} <b>injection</b> moulding, troubleshooting is often performed by examining defective parts for specific defects and addressing these defects with {{the design of the}} mould or the characteristics of the process itself. Trials are often performed before full production runs in an effort to predict defects and determine the appropriate specifications to use in the <b>injection</b> process.|$|E

5|$|The {{industry}} expanded {{rapidly in}} the 1940s because World WarII created a huge demand for inexpensive, mass-produced products. In 1946, American inventor James Watson Hendry built the first screw <b>injection</b> machine, which allowed much more precise control over the speed of <b>injection</b> {{and the quality of}} articles produced. This machine also allowed material to be mixed before <b>injection,</b> so that coloured or recycled plastic could be added to virgin material and mixed thoroughly before being injected. Today, screw <b>injection</b> machines account {{for the vast majority of}} all <b>injection</b> machines. In the 1970s, Hendry went on to develop the first gas-assisted <b>injection</b> moulding process, which permitted the production of complex, hollow articles that cooled quickly. This greatly improved design flexibility as well as the strength and finish of manufactured parts while reducing production time, cost, weight and waste.|$|E
5|$|The {{sequence}} of events during the <b>injection</b> mould of a plastic part is called the <b>injection</b> moulding cycle. The cycle begins when the mould closes, followed by the <b>injection</b> of the polymer into the mould cavity. Once the cavity is filled, a holding pressure is maintained to compensate for material shrinkage. In the next step, the screw turns, feeding the next shot to the front screw. This causes the screw to retract as the next shot is prepared. Once the part is sufficiently cool, the mould opens and the part is ejected.|$|E

40|$|Cardiac slowing {{occurring}} during diagnostic coronary arteriography was {{studied in}} 78 patients. Comparable degrees of slowing occurred with <b>injections</b> {{into the right}} and into the left coronary arteries into the contralateral artery, and with <b>injections</b> into the coronary artery giving rise to the sinus node artery and into the contralateral artery. Rapid intracoronary <b>injections</b> of isosmotic dextrose solution produced significantly less slowing than comparable <b>injections</b> of contrast medium. Slow <b>injections</b> of contrast medium produced cardiac slowing comparable to that caused by rapid <b>injections</b> of contrast medium. However, the cardiac slowing was significantly greater than that produced by rapid <b>injections</b> of dextrose solution. Inhalation of 100 % oxygen did not alter the heart rate response to <b>injections</b> of contrast medium. Atropine produced dose-related attenuation of cardiac slowing. Bradycardia persisting after cholinergic blockade was significantly greater after <b>injections</b> into the coronary artery supplying the sinus node than it was after <b>injections</b> into the contralateral artery. Coronary arteriography produced transient, occasionally profound, arterial hypotension in 38 of 41 patients in whom arterial pressures were recorded.

5|$|Lethal <b>injection</b> is the {{practice}} of injecting one or more drugs into a person by a government {{for the express purpose}} of causing immediate death. While Nazi Germany was known to execute enemies of the state using an <b>injection</b> of lethal drugs, the first country to legalize and formally implement what is referred to today as lethal <b>injection</b> was the United States. The state of Texas adopted it as its form on capital punishment in 1977 and executed the first person by it, Charles Brooks Jr., in 1982. The practice was subsequently adopted by the other U.S. states using capital punishment. As of 2017, the method is being used by 31 U.S. states, as well as by their federal government and military.|$|E
5|$|Lethal <b>injection</b> was {{proposed}} and adopted {{on the grounds}} it was more humane than the methods of execution {{in place at the}} time, such as the electric chair and gas chamber. Opponents of lethal <b>injection</b> reject this argument, noting multiple cases where executions have been either painful, prolonged, or both. According to the Death Penalty Information Center, lethal injections have the highest rate of botched executions of any method used in the US, with 7.12% of executions using this method between 1982 and 2010 considered to have not gone according to plan. A study published in The Lancet in 2005 found that in 43% of cases of lethal <b>injection,</b> the blood level of hypnotics was insufficient to guarantee unconsciousness. However, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled 7–2 in 2008 (Baze v. Rees) and 5–4 in 2015 (Glossip v. Gross) that lethal <b>injection</b> does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.|$|E

40|$|Popularization of {{periodic}} examinations {{to control}} tuberculosis {{has led to}} repeated <b>injections</b> of tuberculin at the same portion of the skin. Consequently, the so-called acceleration phenomenon has become a problem that cannot be made light of.

(2) The relation of the occurrence of this phenomenon to the site of <b>injections.</b> (<b>Injections</b> were made on the flexor surface of both forearms, and reactions were examined 48 hours after <b>injections,)</b> (3) The relation of the occurrence of this phenomenon to the numbers of <b>injections</b> previously made and the dilution of tuberculin.
