2500|$|In 2016, Belafonte {{endorsed}} Bernie Sanders for the Democratic Primary, saying [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> represents opportunity, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{represents a}} moral imperative, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> represents {{a certain kind}} of truth that's not often evidenced in the course of politics".|$|R
50|$|C33B: Negative, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is with C3ØC, over.|$|R
5000|$|... "Borges doesn't care, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> fires {{away and}} doesn't {{think about the}} fans or anyone else. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> fires away with honesty and candor with no other {{objective}} but to tell people what <b>he</b> really <b>thinks.</b> And if people don't like it, fuck 'em." [...] - Bob Ryan ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you know," [...] said <b>he,</b> [...] "what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of Captain Horn? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is a brave man, {{and a man}} {{who knows}} what to do when things turn up suddenly, but, for all that, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is a tyrant. He does what he pleases, and he makes other people do what he pleases, and consults nobody." ...|$|R
60|$|FREDA. [Faintly] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> in the billiard-room with my lady.|$|R
5000|$|Steve Severin has {{attributed}} Smith's {{transition from}} a reticent figure to a more enigmatic front person to Smith's early experiences playing with Siouxsie and the Banshees [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> learnt {{how to be a}} front person, just by standing next to Siouxsie {{for a couple of months}} every night. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> completely changed his persona on stage because of that; he came out of his shell. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> learnt how to be a bit more flamboyant, and how it was okay, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> saw how, y'know... how should I put it... Siouxsie's more [...] "diva" [...] moments were kind of acceptable because they were the front person, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> learnt how to get away with stuff. And just a bit about stagecraft, and how to use the audience a bit more. Because if you look at early clips of their performances you can see he's sort of much more shy and retiring than he becomes a bit later on, and of course, his whole look changes as well.|$|R
60|$|Wise, Yes, once, and again. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> brake twice or thrice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, he's {{none the}} worse for it, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>He</b> has been taking walking exercise, and his {{stiffness}} is wearing off fast. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> misses you very much, and he wouldn't take his food the first day or two. He has got over it now, but I know he longs to hear your voice again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Such a pity!" [...] murmured Mrs. Dennant, and her kindly {{face looked}} quite disturbed. [...] "I've known him {{ever since he}} was a boy. Of course, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> made a great mistake to bring her down here. Not even bein' able to get married makes it doubly awkward. Oh, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> made a great mistake!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, child, he's {{waited so}} long, that I'm {{not sure it}} isn't a bit hard on him. You know, I like him, Fanny--though as you know quite well, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> good enough for you. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> so himself, poor fellow.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am positive. Boys, do {{you know}} what <b>I</b> <b>think?</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is a sharper, and imagines he has three green country boys with money to deal with." ...|$|R

60|$|SYLVIA. Of course I like him.... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> a {{very good}} sort.|$|R
60|$|KNOX. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> a fraud. <b>I</b> {{never saw}} anyone look so robust.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a word," [...] {{said the}} other. [...] "After all, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> knows {{any more than}} a ghost what he pays it for: <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> gets fresh {{instructions}} every time. But, any ways, there it was, all right." ...|$|R
2500|$|On August 14, 2012, Bowles gave an {{interview}} with The Daily Caller where he asserted {{that he is not}} [...] "backing away" [...] from his praise of Republican Vice Presidential Candidate Paul Ryan. Said Bowles: “I <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> smart. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> intellectually curious. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is honest, straightforward and sincere. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> does have a serious budget out there — it doesn’t mean I agree with it {{by any stretch of the}} imagination. But I'm not going to act like I don't like him or that I don't have some real respect for him." [...] Along with his praise of Ryan he also had criticism of the current government.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{would be}} {{indifferent}} to illustrations that is, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> would not value illustrations above simple letterpress." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{wanted to}} utter his half {{finished}} proposal, and so bind her.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was right; but Dicky Hatt never reappeared {{to settle}} the question.|$|R
60|$|TWEENY. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> {{working out}} that plan for laying on hot and cold.|$|R
60|$|PHOEBE. So imperious. (She is {{suddenly}} panic-stricken.) Susan, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> kissed me once.|$|R
60|$|Cetewayo groaned {{but said}} nothing. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{had become too}} faint to speak.|$|R
60|$|MABEL. He was {{changing}} his clothes to go out. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> has gone.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will go in}} and see him," [...] Hilda answered. [...] "I {{have said}} nothing more to him, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is moved. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> means to keep his promise. He has shown a strange {{tenderness}} to me these last few days. I almost believe he is at last remorseful, and ready to undo the evil which he has done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> means that, mamma. If he did {{why should}} he keep me in doubt? He is very true and very honest, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is very hard. When I wrote to him in that way after {{accepting}} the love he had offered me, he was angered, and felt that I was false to him. He is very honest, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> must be very hard." ...|$|R
30|$|P: <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> said dust {{bits and}} then someone misinterpreted it as dust bugs.|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{is going}} to turn down the proposal, but he may accept it.|$|R
60|$|Did he hear {{anything}} else? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> heard his wings slipping to the floor.|$|R
60|$|MABEL (who {{comes of}} a good family). <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> would expect it of us.|$|R
60|$|Alan {{looked at}} it critically. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> had helped to make it not long before.|$|R
60|$|HOPE. That <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> doth; but, however, let us tarry for him. So they did.|$|R
60|$|MILLY. He's been a-moänin' and a-groänin' in 'is sleep, but <b>I</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> be wakkenin' oop.|$|R
60|$|MRS. GWYN. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{ought to}} be told about the selling; it 's not fair.|$|R
5000|$|... “… it {{was also}} true {{that he could have}} been better known and many people were aware of this. It was not in his nature to seek the limelight, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> needed the peace and quiet which allowed him to produce the wonderful, {{sensitive}} and ‘innocent’ works which he did. Over exposure would have destroyed his talent and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> knew it” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was that}} Dick Rover {{who led the}} attack," [...] said Dudd Flockley. [...] "Do you know what <b>I</b> <b>think?</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{is going to try}} to make himself leader of the freshies." ...|$|R
