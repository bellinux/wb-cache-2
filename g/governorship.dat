5|$|In this {{political}} instability, the colonists requested help from Alvarado; Their request initiated {{a period of}} negotiations between Alvarado and Francisco de Montejo, which resulted in Montejo attempting to renounce his <b>governorship</b> claim over Honduras-Higueras in favour of Alvarado, and Alvarado considering the transfer of his own <b>governorship</b> of Chiapas to Montejo in exchange. Permission was sought from the Crown, which refused the exchange and required Montejo to take up his <b>governorship</b> of Honduras-Higueras. News of this refusal, due to {{the slow pace of}} communications with Spain, arrived after Alvarado launched his relief expedition.|$|E
5|$|Robinson again {{assumed the}} {{position}} as Speaker of the Senate on August 16, 1862 {{as part of}} a political deal to effect the resignation of Governor Beriah Magoffin. Magoffin's lieutenant governor, Linn Boyd, had died in office in 1859, and Magoffin was unwilling to allow John Fisk, then Senate Speaker and next in line for the <b>governorship,</b> to succeed him. Magoffin agreed to resign if the Senate would elect Robinson as Speaker, putting him next in line for the <b>governorship.</b> This was done, and at 10:00am on August 18, 1862, Robinson succeeded Magoffin upon the latter's resignation. Because he never resigned from the Senate, Robinson technically held both his legislative seat and the <b>governorship</b> concurrently.|$|E

5|$|After Ahmad Pasha was reassigned as beylerbey of Damascus in 1601, his son Hasan 'Arap Pasha {{inherited}} Gaza's <b>governorship,</b> {{occupying the}} office for 43 years. His rule impoverished Gaza and bankrupted the dynasty. Hasan Pasha's son and successor Husayn Pasha was appointed the office in 1644 and he served until 1672. Under Husayn Pasha's leadership, Gaza became a prosperous, secure and religiously diverse city. He was deposed and executed by the Ottoman authorities in 1663, after which his brother Musa Pasha {{was appointed to the}} post, serving the office until 1679. The last Ridwan governor of Gaza was Musa Pasha's son Ahmad Pasha whose <b>governorship</b> ended in 1690.|$|E

5|$|Ahmad Maymandi's father, Hasan Maymandi, {{was from}} a town named Maymand in Zabulistan, a region known for its popular traditions about the mythological Iranian warrior Rostam. Hasan was the {{governor}} of Bust under Mahmud's father, Sabuktigin, whose kingdom was then a vassal state of the Samanids, who were the lords of Khorasan, and ruled much of the region through their vassals. During Hasan's <b>governorship</b> of Bust, Sabuktigin crucified him, an action which Sabuktigin later regretted. Maymandi was the foster brother and school-fellow of Mahmud, who was also from Zabulistan on his maternal side. Maymandi began his administrative career in 994 {{as head of the}} department of correspondence during Mahmud's <b>governorship</b> of Khorasan under his Samanid overlords. Maymandi was later promoted to chief accountant and head of the military department. He was also appointed as governor of Bust and Rukhkhaj.|$|E
5|$|An early {{governor}} of Gaza Sanjak was Kara Shahin Mustafa, a former jannissary (member {{of a military}} corps) who rose to become an elite military officer and state minister and eventually a vizier and trusted aide of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. He received the <b>governorship</b> of Gaza apparently as an interim appointment before he was appointed Governor of Egypt, although he was deposed three years later by Sultan Selim II. Mustafa died {{a short while later}} and his son Ridwan Pasha, who was the treasurer of Yemen, became governor shortly before Mustafa's death. The Ridwan dynasty, which would rule Gaza for over a century, derives its name from Ridwan Pasha. He was later appointed Governor of Yemen, but was deposed two years later and returned to the <b>governorship</b> of Gaza. After becoming {{governor of}} Ethiopia, Basra, and Diyarbakir in that order, he successfully led an Ottoman contingent against Safavid Persia in 1579. The sultan then awarded him the province of Anatolia where he died in 1585.|$|E

Around {{the middle of}} 1536, Pedro de Alvarado {{received}} news that Alonso Maldonado had been appointed to investigate his <b>governorship</b> of Guatemala, and that Francisco de Montejo had finally accepted <b>governorship</b> of Honduras and was en route. Alvarado was incensed, as his decisive intervention had prevented the complete collapse of the Spanish colonisation efforts in the territory, and he now believed the Spanish position to be secure. With Spanish control apparently firmly established in Honduras, he travelled to Puerto de Caballos and sailed back to Spain {{to deal with his}} legal difficulties. He left the province in mid-August.|$|E
