40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{urbanization}} in China has a {{great impact}} on environment and the Chinese economic development. The sustainable development has been recognized as the key element to keep China’s development with success in the future. This paper uses ecological footprint and <b>biological</b> <b>capacity</b> as indicators to measure regional sustainable degree. The ecological footprint and the <b>biological</b> <b>capacity</b> of Chongqing municipality with 32 million populations have been calculated from 1999 to 2004. The ecological footprint and the <b>biological</b> <b>capacity</b> in Chongqing municipality had obvious changed from 1999 to 2004. The change degree of ecological footprint affected by social and economic development is more prominent than the change degree of <b>biological</b> <b>capacity.</b> The fossil energy land possesses the most proportion, which exceeds 50 % in average. The waste is also an important effect to ecological footprint, which achieves 21 % in proportion. The research results can inform the Chongqing municipality government in more detail to enhance the ecological and environmental protection in the balance of urban development with society, ecology, environment and resource.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{ecological}} footprint {{as an indicator}} estimates the effect of population and industrial products process on ecosystem by evaluating and calculating the used energy and materials in a city, region or country. Dehgolan County is located in Kurdistan province between Hamadan and Sanandaj cities. Dehgolan {{is one of the}} important and effective counties of Kurdistan in agriculture. However, with the population growth in the county and especially in Dehgolan town, productive and fertile lands have been invaded incrementally due to constructions in recent years. This is the main cause of severe reduction in the biological resources of the county. The main goal in this research is to evaluate and assess the rate of {{ecological footprint}} indicator of different land uses in Dehgolan County and its change during 2005 - 2011, and moreover try to find different of ecological footprint and <b>biological</b> <b>capacity</b> in this county. A criteria-based method is used to calculate the footprint of land uses in this paper. Based on Ress and Wakeregnal perspectives, major land uses include forest, pasture, cropland, fisheries and built-up land. Results show that the most increase in rate of ecological footprint belongs to pasture (270 %) and forest (94. 7 %) in 2005 - 2011. Also the most decrease in <b>biological</b> <b>capacity</b> related to cropland (- 9. 6 %).

The antioxidant capacity was measured using 2, 2 ’-azino-bis- 3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid and ferric-reducing antioxidant power assays, whereas ACE inhibition was determined by ACE-inhibitory assay. The ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant capacities of milk casein increased during in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. Casein haplotype significantly influenced the antioxidative and ACE-inhibitory capacities of digested casein. In particular, BB-A 2 A 1 -AA casein and BB-A 1 A 1 - AA casein showed the highest ACE-inhibitory capacity, BB-A 2 A 2 -AA casein showed the highest antioxidant capacity, whereas BB-A 2 A 2 -BB casein showed the lowest <b>biological</b> <b>capacity.</b> To date, few studies have been done on the effect of casein haplotype on <b>biological</b> <b>capacity</b> of milk casein, thus the present study sets the basis for a new knowledge that could lead to the production of milk with better nutraceutical properties...|$|R

From a questionnaire developed in a previous mind perception study, authors found that perceived minds could be located on two dimensions experience and agency.

In this questionnaire, subjects had to evaluate explicit mental capacities of target characters (e. g. capacity to feel hunger).

40|$|Quantum {{mechanics}} has {{an important}} role in photosynthesis, magnetoreception, and evolution. There were many attempts in an effort to explain the structure of genetic code and transfer of information from DNA to protein by using the concepts of quantum mechanics. The existing biological quantum channel models are not sufficiently general to incorporate all relevant contributions responsible for imperfect protein synthesis. Moreover, the problem of determination of quantum <b>biological</b> channel <b>capacity</b> is still an open problem. To solve these problems, we construct the operator-sum representation of biological channel based on codon basekets (basis vectors), and determine the quantum channel model suitable for study of the quantum <b>biological</b> channel <b>capacity</b> and beyond. The transcription process, DNA point mutations, insertions, deletions, and translation are interpreted as the quantum noise processes. The various types of quantum errors are classified into several broad categories: (i) storage errors that occur in DNA itself as it represents an imperfect storage of genetic information, (ii) replication errors introduced during DNA replication process, (iii) transcription errors introduced during DNA to mRNA transcription, and (iv) translation errors introduced during the translation process. By using this model, we determine the <b>biological</b> quantum channel <b>capacity</b> and compare it against corresponding classical <b>biological</b> channel <b>capacity.</b> We demonstrate that the quantum <b>biological</b> channel <b>capacity</b> is higher than the classical one, for a coherent quantum channel model, suggesting that quantum effects have {{an important role in}} biological systems. The proposed model is of crucial importance towards future study of quantum DNA error correction, developing quantum mechanical model of aging, developing the quantum mechanical models for tumors/cancer, and study of intracellular dynamics in general...|$|R

40|$|Notions like ‘biolinguistics’ have {{a trivial}} and a non-trivial interpretation. According to the trivial version, a {{cultural}} phenomenon like language is only {{based on our}} innate <b>biological</b> <b>capacities.</b> Language, in this view, {{is not a matter}} of biology per se but of applied biology, i. e. a form of technology. Under this interpretation, ‘biolinguistics’ is uncontroversial and trivial because all our cultural activities are grounded in our biology. According to the non-trivial interpretation, the concept of language can be sufficiently narrowly construed so that we can define a core capacity that is comparable to a biological organ (like the heart or the liver). Recently, it has become common to see this ‘faculty of language in the narrow sense’ (FLN) as some abstract form of syntax characterized by recursive Merge. According to this article, only the trivial interpretation of ‘biolinguistics’ is correct. It does not make sense to define language in such a way that it excludes words. Words are human inventions and the necessary tools to give linguistic functionality to whatever <b>biological</b> <b>capacities</b> for recursive syntax we may have. Ultimately, this means that only ‘lexicalist’ versions of generative grammar can be correct. The agentive function assignment involved in the invention of words distinguishes language from bodily organs, which do not derive their functionality from human agency.

The linear constraints, like mass conservation constraint, reversibility constraint, <b>biological</b> <b>capacity</b> constraint, can be imposed on linear algorithms. However, recently a non-linear constraint based on the second thermodynamic law, known as "loop law", has emerged and challenged the existing algorithms. Proven to be unfeasible with linear solutions, this non-linear constraint has been successfully imposed on the sampling process. In this place, Monte - Carlo sampling with Metropolis criterion and Simulated Annealing has been introduced to optimize the Biomass synthesis of genome scale metabolic network of Helicobacter pylori (iIT 341 GSM / GPR) under mass conservation constraint, <b>biological</b> <b>capacity</b> constraint, and thermodynamic constraints including reversibility and "loop law". The sampling method has also been employed to optimize a non-linear objective function, the Biomass synthetic rate, which is unified by the total income number of reducible electrons. To verify whether a sample contains internal loops, an automatic solution has been developed based on solving a set of inequalities.
