2500|$|The 0Z4 was a <b>gas-filled</b> <b>rectifier</b> tube {{commonly}} used in vacuum tube car radios in the 1940s and 1950s. It was a conventional full-wave rectifier tube with two anodes and one cathode, but was unique in {{that it had no}} filament (thus the [...] "0" [...] in its type number). The electrodes were shaped such that the reverse breakdown voltage was much higher than the forward breakdown voltage. Once the breakdown voltage was exceeded, the 0Z4 switched to a low-resistance state with a forward voltage drop of about 24 V.|$|E
2500|$|Thermionic (vacuum-tube) diodes and {{solid-state}} (semiconductor) diodes {{were developed}} separately, at {{approximately the same}} time, in the early 1900s, as radio receiver detectors. [...] Until the 1950s, vacuum diodes were used more frequently in radios because the early point-contact semiconductor diodes were less stable. In addition, most receiving sets had vacuum tubes for amplification that could easily have the thermionic diodes included in the tube (for example the 12SQ7 double diode triode), and vacuum-tube <b>rectifiers</b> and <b>gas-filled</b> <b>rectifiers</b> were capable of handling some high-voltage/high-current rectification tasks better than the semiconductor diodes (such as selenium rectifiers) that were available at that time.|$|R

50|$|The {{capabilities}} and economy of power electronics system {{are determined by}} the active devices that are available. Their characteristics and limitations are a key element in the design of power electronics systems. Formerly, the mercury arc valve, the high-vacuum and <b>gas-filled</b> diode thermionic <b>rectifiers,</b> and triggered devices such as the thyratron and ignitron were widely used in power electronics. As the ratings of solid-state devices improved in both voltage and current-handling capacity, vacuum devices have been nearly entirely replaced by solid-state devices.|$|R
