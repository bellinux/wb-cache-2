40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop a {{solvency}} model {{to estimate the}} necessary economic capital of a real <b>insurance</b> <b>undertaking</b> operating solely in the Automobile branch, applying the Tail Conditional Expectation risk measure. The model assumes a one year time horizon static approach with an unchanged asset and liability structure for the company. After discussing the main factors affecting {{the whole of the}} insurance activity and their influence on the assets and liabilities on that real <b>insurance</b> <b>undertaking</b> used in the study, we calculate its necessary economic capital, by using the Monte Carlo simulation technique to generate the probability distribution of the possible future profit and losses with impact on the company’s fair value. This paper introduces an application of a set of techniques that are usually applied to manage asset and liability risks to capital requirements. With a simulated exercise applied to a real <b>insurance</b> <b>undertaking</b> we show its feasibility, its advantages and how useful it may be for investors, regulators and remaining stakeholders when the technique is explored in depth...|$|R

40|$|Customer {{loyalty is}} a goal for many service organizations. Many {{marketing}} initiatives are implemented to favourably affect customer sentiment and build loyalty. Loyalty can be manifest as {{the length of the}} relationship, which is referred to as tenure, or the breadth of the relationship, also referred to as share of wallet or level of cross-purchasing. A long-tenure customer base is said to provide many benefits to the service provider. One of these claimed benefits is reduced price sensitivity (e. g. Reichheld & Teal 1996). One operationalisation of this benefit is that the impact of a price increase to a long-tenure customer will be lower than the impact of a price increase to a short-tenure customer. However, limited empirical evidence exists as to the accuracy of this belief. This study investigated whether long-tenure customers are indeed more sensitive or less sensitive to price increases. It used individual-level consumer records (n= 69, 672) from a large <b>domestic</b> <b>insurance</b> provider. The data was sourced from internal company records, and was based on the response to renewal notices sent to <b>domestic</b> <b>insurance</b> customers.

50|$|At {{first the}} PICC {{monopoly}} continued to operate its various insurance services, integrating {{the assets of}} the former independent insurance sector. By 1952, PICC represented a national network of 1,300 branches and 3,000 agency outlets. Yet the Chinese government, in its effort to develop its regime, determined that insurance was superfluous in a state where the government was meant to provide for all social welfare for its citizens. In 1959, therefore, all <b>domestic</b> <b>insurance</b> business was ended. PICC's role was reduced to providing insurance covering the country's foreign policy needs, such as for the marine and aviation sectors. Following the reform, PICC was converted into a department of the government's central bank.|$|R

30|$|It {{takes longer}} to process cross-national pension {{applications}} than national pensions. Frequent delays occur during {{the confirmation of}} the extent of insurance periods in Morocco and Turkey, as local institutions must generate individual insurance data from documents provided in paper form by regional offices.

Thus, for example, the pension application for the Austrian or German part is processed very quickly as the <b>domestic</b> <b>insurance</b> file is essentially ready at the time of application, but in Turkey, the process may take many months (for details see Holzmann et al. 2016 a, 2016 b).

40|$|What {{have been}} the {{consequences}} of integrating the single market via mutual recognition? Did competitive deregulation result? Or were its implications less significant than expected? In this paper I analyse two previously highly regulated service sectors, insurance and road haulage, and study the impact of European policies in Germany and France. I find that the Council instituted mutual recognition in a restrictive way. This limits its impact on member states, which is moreover mediated by national factors. In both sectors, {{the use of the}} freedom to provide services has stayed much below expectations. Consequently, the single market rules have primarily resulted in a liberalization of national markets, where this had not already been achieved, for instance, in Germany.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the incentives states {{have to provide}} insurance regulatory services in an efficient manner. Regulation of the insurance industry in the United States is unique, as it is conducted primarily {{at the state level}} whereas the majority of insurance sales are interstate. Consistent with predictions from the federalism literature, we find evidence of trans-state externalities, as states with small <b>domestic</b> <b>insurance</b> markets are less efficient producers of insurance regulation and appear to allow states that choose to expend the greatest resources to regulate for them. In addition, states with more profitable domestic insurers are shown to export greater levels of regulation, suggesting extraterritorial regulation may erect modest barriers to entry. We find evidence of increasing economies of scale in the production of insurance regulation after controlling for these regulatory externalities.
