The damageswere distributed in a narrow belt extending from SSW to NNE. The length of the damagedarea was 1. 6 km and the width was 150 m at maximum. The wind direction associated withthe Tatsumaki was able to be presumed from the diretion of blown roof tiles, and therotating wind system was found. The distributions of pressure fall and wind speed in theTatsumaki were estimated from the meteorological records obtained at some observatoriesalong the path. The peak gust is evaluated to be about 42 m/s from the meteorological analysisand also to be more than 40 m/s from the damages.

40|$|Measurement of {{ambient noise}} during typhoon no. 10 (1984), {{passed by the}} west coast of KYUSYU, on {{frequencies}} from 4 Hz to 1000 Hz were made in the New Mie Fishing Port of NAGASAKI. These results were compared with measurements in the New Mie Fishing Port and in the shallow water near Azisone during the moderate weather. During the moderate weather, the measured ambient noise spectra in the port was produced predominantly by marine life, and no noise was recorded from outside of the port due to the barrier provided by the sea wall and the shallow water. During the high-sea-state conditions of typhoon no. 10, the measured ambient noise levels were directly dependant on the wave conditions in the port, at the sea wall and {{at the mouth of the}} port. However, in the 4 Hz- 12. 5 Hz range, the noise levels included ambient noise from outside of the port' s sea wall.

40|$|A {{shot peening}} process is {{generally}} utilized {{as one of}} the surface treatment processes to improve the fatigue life and the fatigue strength of cyclically loaded components. This improvement is achieved by inducing compressive residual stresses and work hardening effects in areas close to the surface. But the influence of the shot peening process on fatigue strength is not clarified enough. It's significant technologically and industrially to clarify the influence factor of shot peening on the fatigue strength. Former study of author confirmed that main effect on the fatigue strength of the SUS 304 steel <b>hitted</b> by controlled steel ball is the hardening of austenite structure itself due to the shot peening. In this study, the SUS 329 J 1 steel having both austenite and ferrite phases was also investigated from the viewpoint of the work hardening of both structures. An effect of the residual stress on fatigue limit is not observed at all. As a result, we found that the work hardening of the SUS 329 J 1 steel by shot peening was attributed to both the strain-induced martensitic transformation and the hardening of austenite and ferrite phase themselves. Especially, the ferrite phase influences the Vickers hardness distribution of shot-peened material, and the hardness increment of the austenite phase is larger than other phase and mainly due to the fine structure...|$|E
40|$|Although Brecht’s epic theatre and {{its system}} is studied in many schools of {{theatrical}} scenic art, in most cases, they are misunderstandings and inaccurate interpretations of this entirely school of specific scenic – drama knowledge. Often, Brecht {{was accused of}} his “red” line approach and aesthetic ideology of art, and so, his genius creativity has remained under-shadowed. Not only his knowledge for drama and the art, but also, his study and knowledge for spectators is prominent as well. Moreover, Brecht considers this line of communication {{as the basis of}} scenic theatre-arts, because he is fully conscious that there is no theatre without spectator. But, ironically, the Brechtian epic theatre is mostly <b>hitted</b> by being alluded as a the theatre that is used as an instrument for “awareness-education” of mass-spectators, while, in its essence Brechtian theatre attempts to led the spectator towards his freedom. Judgment of (anti) socio-cultural values, political, religious, philosophic morals, etc., is a process that is referred to the freedom of thinking. The objective of the epic theatres is to offer the satisfaction by evaluating these (anti) values. And evaluation, does not rarely request transformation. Therefore, the transformation that is driven by Brechtian V-effect is not an ideological transformation, as is very often attributed to epic theatre, but it is immanence for critical stand and re-finding of values. The Brecht Theater request to meet with other arts, but, also with knowledge of different scientific fields, it is also named the theatre of science...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the effect of the optical {{illusion}} by colors on the performance of ball throwing task to target. In experiment 1, it is examined how the apparent distances of the targets were affected by changes in the color of the target. Subjects are required to visually compare the distance to the target in the controled condition with the distance in the experimental condition. The color of the target in the control condition is black. The colors for targets in the four experimental conditions are red, orange, blue, and navy. The result indicates that, the apparent distances in the blue and navy conditions are farter than the apparent distances in the red and orange conditions. In experiment 2, the effect of optical illusion by colors on performances in ball throwing task are examined. Subjects are required to practice 50 trials under the controled condition. After a brief rest they are required to throw for twelve trials under the experimental condition. The colors of targets in the experimental conditions aer the same as in experiment 1. The distances to the target in the experimental condition are 7 m for male or 6 m for female. The average scores in each color in the experimental condition are analyzed. The results are as follows. The targets of red and orange are <b>hitted</b> under the targets than those of blue and navy.
