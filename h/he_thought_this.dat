5|$|Several {{characters}} {{were based on}} real people: Aleph's mentor Okamoto was named after {{the owner of the}} building Atlus occupied during the game's development; Matsumoto was named after Ito's first landlord in Tokyo; and Mekata was named after an NHK reporter. Additionally, Red Bear was named after the evil organization from the superhero film Aikoku Sentai Dainippon. Some character designs were created with the Super Famicom hardware limitations in mind: Kaneko designed three different poses for the Twelve Heavenly Generals, which were combined in various ways with graphics for different heads and held items, along with different color palettes, resulting in twelve different combinations. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> acceptable as the generals were a group, and were meant to look cohesive.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{issue of}} {{debate within the}} {{sovereignty}} movement became on what terms sovereignty would be put before the electorate. Parizeau, long identified with the independantiste wing of the party, was opposed to the PQ's general historical preference for an economic relationship {{with the rest of}} Canada to be offered alongside sovereignty, as <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> would encourage the Federal government to simply refuse to negotiate and cast the project as doomed, as had happened in 1980. As a practical matter, Parizeau believed that given the emotional circumstances of separation a special partnership was unlikely, and that given free trade agreements and other multilateral institutions it was unnecessary.|$|E
25|$|The German {{physician}} Gottlob Schober (1670-1739), {{who worked}} in Russia from 1712, notes that a person could hang from the ribs for about three days prior to expiring, his primary pain being that of extreme thirst. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> degree of insensitivity was something peculiar to the Russian mentality.|$|E

25|$|Kurumada once stated that, at first, Athena was {{not going}} to exist as a character. She was rather going to be {{experienced}} individually by each of the protagonists in different spiritual ways. Later, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> concept would be confusing to readers and difficult to use, so he decided to integrate her into his manga as a character, with her own traits and personality.|$|E
25|$|Charles Cutler Torrey taught Semitic {{languages}} at Yale University. His lasting contribution {{has been}} to show how much more meaningful prophets, such as the scribe of Revelation, are when treated as poets first and foremost. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> was a point often lost sight of because most English bibles render everything in prose. Poetry was also the reason John never directly quoted the older prophets. Had he done so, {{he would have had}} to use their (Hebrew) poetry whereas he wanted to write his own. Torrey insisted Revelation had originally been written in Aramaic.|$|E
25|$|On 24 October the inquest {{heard that}} Menezes was {{initially}} not {{considered as a}} suspect, and that the police wanted unarmed officers to halt and question him in case he had information about the failed terrorist attack of 21 July 2005. Detective Sergeant Piers Dingemans and a four-man squad were tasked with stopping Menezes for intelligence purposes as he travelled to Stockwell station on a bus. Dingemans told the inquest that his car was behind the bus when he was stood down at 09:55, and said <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> was because Menezes was then considered a suspect.|$|E

25|$|The Federal Public Housing Authority {{had placed}} the {{buildings}} {{in charge of}} a manager whose duty it was to rent the houses, collect the rents, and generally to supervise operations, subject to over-all control by the Authority. He ordered Tucker to discontinue all religious activities in the village. Tucker refused. Later the manager ordered Tucker to leave the village. Insisting that the manager had no right to suppress religious activities, appellant declined to leave, and his arrest followed. At the trial the manager testified that the controlling Federal agency had given him full authority to regulate the conduct of those living in the village, and that he did not allow preaching by ministers of any denomination without a permit issued by him in his discretion. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> broad authority was entrusted to him, at least in part, by a regulation, which the Authority's Washington office had allegedly promulgated. He testified that this regulation provided that no peddlers or hawkers could come into or remain in the village without getting permission from the manager.|$|E
25|$|Late in his life, Shockley became {{intensely}} {{interested in}} questions of race, human intelligence, and eugenics. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> work {{was important to}} the genetic future {{of the human species}} and he came to describe it as the most important work of his career, even though expressing his views damaged his reputation. Shockley argued that a higher rate of reproduction among the less intelligent was having a dysgenic effect, and that a drop in average intelligence would ultimately lead to a decline in civilization. With regard to racial differences he used the following standard statement, e.g., on a debate with Afro-centrist Frances Welsing and on Firing Line with William F. Buckley Jr.:My research leads me inescapably to the opinion that the major cause of the American Negro's intellectual and social deficits is hereditary and racially genetic in origin and, thus, not remediable to a major degree by practical improvements in the environment.Shockley's published writings and lectures to scientific organizations on this topic were partly based on the writings of psychologist Cyril Burt and were funded by the Pioneer Fund. Shockley also proposed that individuals with IQs below 100 be paid to undergo voluntary sterilization.|$|E
25|$|When Subaru faces Fūma in battle, {{he allows}} the Dragon of Earth to blind {{him in his}} right eye—a lesser wish Subaru had held for some time. In single combat against Seishirō at Rainbow Bridge, Subaru reveals his true desire: he wishes to be killed by him, as thus he would exist in Seishirō's heart. However, due to a spell cast by Hokuto at her death, the killing strike is reversed, and Subaru kills Seishirō instead. Hokuto has told Seishiro this spell cast when Seishiro killed her as she said she has the last {{confidence}} for him because 'Subaru loves him'. This implied that Sheshiro is willing to kill himself by Subaru as <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> is Subaru's real hope. As a result of Seishirō's death, Subaru loses his will to fight alongside his ability to create a barrier which causes {{him to leave the}} Dragons of Heaven. Fūma brings him Seishiro's eye which is necessary to grant the assassin's wish: erasing Fūma's mark in Subaru by replacing Subaru's wounded eye. Subaru accepts the eye, inheriting his powers and the Sakurazukamori title in the process and becoming one of the Dragons of Earth. Despite joining Fūma, Subaru is still interested in Kamui's true wish.|$|E

25|$|By mid-September 1917 the Ottoman Army {{had decided}} against {{the attempt to}} retake Baghdad. Enver Pasha took von Falkenhayn's advice to send the Yildirim Army Group to Palestine, to face the growing threat {{reported}} by Kress von Kressenstein. Enver Pasha issued orders on 26 September for the Fourth Army headquarters to move to Damascus, {{at the same time}} dividing the area in half, leaving Cemal Pasha with responsibility for Syria and western Arabia. On 2 October, Enver Pasha activated the new Eighth Army, commanded by Kress von Kressenstein, and deployed it along with the Seventh Army, commanded by Mustafa Kemal, to the Yildirim Army Group, commanded by von Falkenhayn. However, in late September Mustafa Kemal disagreed with some of Enver Pasha's decisions and the new command structure. He advised adopting a defensive military policy, in response to the superior British lines of communications, which would ensure continued numerical superiority in any contested theatre. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> imbalance would make it impossible for the Yildirim Army Group to go on the offensive. He advised merging the Seventh and the Eighth Armies, offering to step down in favour of Kress von Kressenstein. Several weeks later Mustafa Kemal resigned and Fevzi Pasa took command of the Seventh Army which was still assembling near Aleppo. By October 1917 the headquarters of the Eighth Army commanded by Kress von Keressenstein was at Huleikat to north of Huj.|$|E

500|$|Josiah Royce (1855–1916) {{built on}} the {{transcendental}} idealism view of conscience, viewing it as the ideal of life which constitutes our moral personality, our plan of being ourself, of making common sense ethical decisions. But, <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>this</b> was only true insofar as our conscience also required loyalty to [...] "a mysterious higher or deeper self." ...|$|E
500|$|Yet, Kierkegaard was {{concerned}} about Regine because she tended to assume the life-view of characters she saw in the plays of Shakespeare at the theater. One day she would be [...] "Beatrice in Much Ado about Nothing" [...] and another Juliet. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> to be a difficulty she needed to surpass and diagnosed both her and himself like this in Stages on Life's Way (1845).|$|E

500|$|Previous {{episodes of}} the show where the Simpsons visit other {{countries}} have been controversial. For example, the Simpsons visited Australia in [...] "Bart vs. Australia" [...] (season six, 1995) and Brazil in [...] "Blame It on Lisa" [...] (season 13, 2002) and both episodes generated controversy and negative reaction in the visited countries. In the latter case, Rio de Janeiro's tourist boardwho claimed {{that the city was}} portrayed as having rampant street crime, kidnappings, slums, and monkey and rat infestationswent so far as to threaten Fox with legal action. When asked whether <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> episode would generate similar controversies, Al Jean replied [...] "I'm Irish American and I know Irish people have an excellent sense of humor so we weren't very worried." ...|$|E

[...] He threatened to expel Taylor, who responded by saying a forced departure would mean the end of US support. However, Khánh later said he was open to the possibility of going abroad and asked Taylor if <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> {{would be good for the}} country, to which the ambassador replied in the affirmative. Khánh also said he took responsibility for his generals' actions, and expressed regret at what they had done. Khánh then ended the meeting, saying he would think about his future.|$|E
500|$|For the Vertigo Tour, {{the group}} {{originally}} considered dropping the song from their set lists, but Mullen and Clayton successfully argued against this. All 131 of the Vertigo Tour concerts featured {{a performance of}} the song, which were accompanied by the stage's LED video curtains displaying African flags. On the tour's opening night, this reminded Bono that he had originally written the lyrics in an Ethiopian village. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> visual accompaniment made the song come full circle, saying, [...] "And here it was, nearly twenty years later, coming back to Africa, all the stuff about parched lands and deserts making sense for the first time." [...] The song was also played at the preview screening of the band's concert film U2 3D at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. [...] At the Glastonbury Festival 2010, The Edge accompanied rock band Muse for a live cover version of the track, later playing it with U2 while headlining Glastonbury in 2011.|$|E
