30|$|The {{summer heat}} and winter cold pushes an {{increase}} in the penetration of air-conditioning load, therefore, change both the magnitude and composition of the system demand. Along with the higher load come several problems, the extensive usage of <b>household</b> <b>air-conditioner</b> is leading to capacity straining load peaks, increasing the costs of electricity supply and volumes of greenhouse gases emissions. Moreover, if the air-conditioning load reaches certain portion of feeder load, then it is very likely to cause security and reliability problem [9, 10]. The recent load peaks have resulted in supply disruptions, and on some occasions, high spot price on the NEM [11]. Accordingly, initiatives to curtail/shift peak demand have significant future potential value in terms of reducing growth-related infrastructure investment and improving system reliability. Fortunately, demand response programs provide an effective solution to the residential air-conditioning load problem. Demand response refers to “changes in electric usage by end-use customers from their normal consumption patterns in response to changes in the price of electricity over time, or to incentive payments designed to induce lower electricity use at times of high wholesale market prices or when system reliability is jeopardized” [12]. Turning on and off air conditioning appliances doesn’t change indoor temperature immediately. As a result, air conditioning appliances become important and effective objects in demand response programs. Nowadays, increasing number of Australian utilities is moving towards supporting wide scale introduction of interval metering and design of demand response programs to improve the efficiency of the NEM. In the next section, a number of barriers blocking the further applications of demand response programs will be discussed.|$|R
40|$|Governments {{worldwide}} {{are attempting}} to reduce energy consumption and environmental pollution by confronting environmental problems and adopting more energy-efficient products. However, because of the rebound effect, energy-saving targets cannot always be fully achieved, and sometimes greater energy consumption is generated. Research on the rebound effect {{from the perspective of}} industrial ecology considers not only direct energy consumption but also its life cycle negative impacts on the environment with China's rapid economic development and simultaneously improving quality of life, the ownership of room air conditioners (RACs) has increased more than three hundred times, and air conditioners' energy consumption has increased one thousand times over the last twenty years. The Air Conditioner Energy Efficiency Standard {{is one of the most}} important measures in China for reducing the amount of energy consumed by RACs. This paper introduces a life cycle based method to estimate the rebound effect of Chinese RACs consumption. This model provides a product's life-cycle view to assess the rebound effect, considering the contribution of both producer and consumer. Based on the established life cycle rebound effect model, we compared urban household RAC consumption behaviour before and after the launch of the Air Conditioner Energy Efficiency Standard. A rebound effect in RAC consumption was found that there was a longer daily usage period in the household as air conditioner efficiency levels improved. The life cycle rebound effect of <b>household</b> <b>air-conditioner</b> consumption was calculated to be 67 %. The main conclusion obtained from this study is that policies and regulations should consider the rebound effect when encouraging households to alter their energy consumption patterns.

40|$|Government {{officials}} have recently {{paid more attention}} to emissions produced by power plants and have called for more adoption of innovative energy-saving facilities. Among these energy-saving facilities, many scholars and governments have recommended using heat pumps. A heat pump is a kind of heat exchanging device capable of producing cooling and heating function or even hot water with energy-saving properties. Nevertheless, the principles and theories indicate that the heat pump functions should not be limited to a single functional mode at a time. It is possible to achieve bi-functional modes simultaneously via the heat recovery process. While some large heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems possess the dual functions simultaneously, this kind of bi-functional mode has not been available for the <b>household</b> size <b>air-conditioner</b> or heat pump. To prove this and check for its technical feasibility, a conversion of the existing household size air-conditioning system using the heat pump principle into the bi-functional mode was undertaken. Given over millions of small- and medium-size hospitality operators may benefit from it all over the world, a further investigation was undertaken in the second stage. Focus group interviews were conducted to identify the factors slowing and quickening the commercialization of the bi-functional mode type of the heat pump or air-conditioner with reference to network theory.

40|$|In Southeast Queensland, 75 % of <b>households</b> have an <b>air-conditioner</b> and 1 -in- 4 {{detached}} homes {{now have}} a rooftop Solar PV – {{one of the highest}} take-up rates in the world. Solar PV exceeded all expectations, but underpinning take-up rates are subsidy schemes funded by artificially raising tariffs above the regulated set-point, creating wealth transfers amongst electricity consumers. The structure of the two-part tariff is dominated by a flat-rate variable charge which amplifies wealth transfers through ‘hidden subsidies’. In this article, using interval meter data at the customer switchboard circuit level, an optimal network tariff isolates the incidence of inequitable wealth transfers arising from air-conditioner and solar PV units. Results demonstrate a Demand Tariff substantially increases the efficiency and fairness of the price signal. Above all, a Demand Tariff reduces the structural instability of network prices given a rate-of-return regulatory constraint...|$|R
40|$|The {{capillary}} tube {{is an important}} control device used in small vapor compression refrigeration systems such as window <b>air-conditioners,</b> <b>household</b> refrigerators and freezers. This paper develops a non-dimensional correlation based on the test results of the adiabatic {{capillary tube}} for the mass flow rate through the tube using a hydrocarbon refrigerant mixture of 89. 3 % propane and 10. 7 % butane (HCM). The Taguchi method, a statistical experimental design approach, was employed. This approach explores the economic benefit that lies in studies of this nature, where {{only a small number}} of experiments are required and yet valid results are obtained. Considering the effects of the capillary tube geometry and the inlet condition of the tube, dimensionless parameters were chosen. The new correlation was also based on the Buckingham Pi theorem. This correlation predicts 86. 67 % of the present experimental data within a relative deviation of - 10 % to + 10 %. The predictions by this correlation were also compared with results in published literature...|$|R
30|$|PeakSmart air-conditioner {{as part of}} {{positive}} payback program {{is an example of}} successful demand response program being implemented in Queensland. Currently, there are 4 ranges of the demand meter in Queensland: ① low, up to 1999  MW; ② moderate, from 2000 to 2999  MW; ③ high, from 3000 to 3999  MW; ④ extreme, above 4000  MW [39]. PeakSmart air-conditioner units operate when peak demand on network rises above 3000  MW. There are 3 DRMs for air-conditioners, depending on how extreme the need for demand management becomes. Compressor gets off in DRM 1. Air conditioning unit is capped to operate at 50 % in DRM 2 while in DRM 3, it is capped to operate at 75 %. PeakSmart demand management solutions rely on audio frequency load control (AFLC) system, which operates by the injection of a high frequency (1042 Hz) coded signal onto the high voltage network at substations, to send signals to participating <b>households.</b> All PeakSmart <b>air-conditioners</b> are equipped with a signal receiver. A signal is sent remotely from the operator via power supply that tells the air-conditioner to cap its energy consumption on occasions when the network reaches peak demand [39]. Another successful example is 770000 residential customers hot water systems connected to a controlled load tariff in Queensland. Load control of hot water reduces peak demand [40] and can be used to increase load during the day to absorb solar PV output.|$|R
40|$|China {{is already}} the second's largest energy {{consumer}} in the world after the United States, and its demand for energy {{is expected to continue}} to grow rapidly in the foreseeable future, due to its fast economic growth and its low level of energy use per capita. From 2001 to 2005, the growth rate of energy consumption in China has exceeded the growth rate of its economy (NBS, 2006), raising serious concerns about the consequences of such energy use on local environment and global climate. It is widely expected that China is likely to overtake the US in energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions {{during the first half of}} the 21 st century. Therefore, there is considerable interest in the international community in searching for options that may help China slow down its growth in energy consumption and GHG emissions through improving energy efficiency and adopting more environmentally friendly fuel supplies such as renewable energy. This study examines the energy saving potential of three major residential energy end uses: household refrigeration, air-conditioning, and water heating. China {{is already the}} largest consumer market in the world for household appliances, and increasingly the global production base for consumer appliances. Sales of <b>household</b> refrigerators, room <b>air-conditioners,</b> and water heaters are growing rapidly due to rising incomes and booming housing market. At the same time, the energy use of Chinese appliances is relatively inefficient compared to similar products in the developed economies. Therefore, the potential for energy savings through improving appliance efficiency is substantial. This study focuses particularly on the impact of more stringent energy efficiency standards for household appliances, given that such policies are found to be very effective in improving the efficiency of household appliances, and are well established both in China and around world (CLASP, 2006) ...|$|R
