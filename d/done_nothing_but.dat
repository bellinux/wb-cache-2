2500|$|The {{garrison}} of Potosí rebelled January 1, 1821 and Maroto marched against them, {{defeating the}} insurgents {{and taking the}} city. Nonetheless, on the arrival of General Pedro Antonio Olañeta, who as deputy of the viceroy exercised his authority throughout Alto Perú, {{he was ordered to}} return to Charcas. After a heated argument, Maroto complied with the orders he'd received. The disagreements between the two were further amplified when, during the brief invasion of Alto Perú by Andrés de Santa Cruz, Maroto refused to comply with the orders of Olañeta, who protested hotly against him to viceroy José de la Serna, stating, among other things, that [...] "ever since this man set foot in America, he has <b>done</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> foment insubordination and express ill against the authorities." [...] The viceroy, who did not have excessive confidence in Olañeta, opted to promote both to the rank of field marshal, despite the fact that Olañeta had played only a limited role in the campaign, and Maroto none at all.|$|E
2500|$|The Charge of the Heavy Brigade {{had lasted}} {{no more than}} 10 minutes. Ryzhov's cavalry {{suffered}} 40–50 killed and over 200 wounded; the British lost 10 killed and 98 wounded. Scarlett's attack had been a remarkable success, yet {{it could have been}} a greater victory. When the Heavies attacked, the Earl of Cardigan's Light Brigade was less than 500 yards (~450 m) from Ryzhov's cavalry. The spectators on the Sapouné Heights, and the officers and men in the Light Brigade watching the Russians retreat in disorder, expected Cardigan to lead a pursuit and finish them off. Captain William Morris of the 17th Lancers urged his commander on, but Cardigan claimed he could not advance given the orders he had received from Lucan to remain in his position 'and to defend it against any attack'. Lucan later gave a different version from Cardigan's. He confirmed he had ordered Cardigan to defend his position, but maintained that his parting orders made it quite clear that he had permission to take advantage of so obvious an opportunity. Whatever the differences the Light Brigade had <b>done</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> look on. When Morris rode back to his regiment after confronting Cardigan, he could not hide his frustration – [...] "My God, my God, what a chance we are losing." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{timing of}} the mission was crucial due to the pessimistic {{military}} forecasts and the widespread rumours of an imminent coup. Diệm's Presidential military adviser Dương Văn Minh had recently informed Lodge that 80 percent of Vietnamese people had no motive for supporting Diệm and that the recent lifting of martial law was [...] "eyewash for Americans". Despite his title, Minh had no command power and was confined to primarily ceremonial duties. Diệm feared that Minh had become too popular after his success in the Battle for Saigon against the criminal Bình Xuyên and his campaigns to quell the private armies of the Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài religious sects in the 1950s and had removed him from commanding troops. The two guardhouses outside Minh's headquarters at Tan Son Nhut Air Base were filled with political prisoners, many of them student protestors. Minh was widely believed to be seeking a coup against Diệm. He frequently railed against Diệm in his meeting with Lodge, decrying the police state that was being created by the Cần Lao Party of the Ngô family. Harkins reported that Minh [...] "has <b>done</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> complain {{to me about the}} government and the way it is handled since I have been here". Harkins also put scepticism onto Minh's claims of widespread public disenchantment.|$|E

2500|$|Madjo joined Crawley Town on 28 June 2007, signing {{alongside}} Jon-Paul Pittman and Tyrone Thompson. He scored {{twice on}} his debut in Crawley's {{first game of}} the 2007–08 season, a 2–1 home win against Stevenage. The following week, Madjo scored again, this time in a 4–1 away loss at Salisbury City. In September 2007, Madjo scored in five consecutive fixtures, including a brace in a 5–3 home win against Woking. He also scored twice within the space of a week in October 2007, scoring in away fixtures against Kidderminster Harriers and Weymouth respectively. Madjo had scored 11 goals in 18 games, which prompted speculation regarding a move into the Football League. Madjo said [...] "It is nice to have people say good things about you but at the moment I'm not thinking about other clubs. All I think about is doing my job and doing my best for Crawley". On 21 November 2007, four days after earning a call up to the Cameroon squad, Madjo joined League One side Cheltenham Town on a one-month loan, with a view to a permanent move. On Madjo's departure, Crawley Town manager Steve Evans said [...] "As a manager, I'm extremely disappointed. As a club, we always knew this day would come. He's an exceptional talent and a model professional". Madjo made his Cheltenham debut on 25 November 2007, coming on as a 77th-minute substitute in Cheltenham's [...] "shock" [...] 1–0 home victory over Leeds United. He started his first game three weeks later, a 1–0 win against Luton Town. During his one-month loan spell, Madjo made five appearances for Cheltenham. Despite impressing Cheltenham manager Keith Downing, the club opted against buying the player on a permanent basis as a result of Downing having more funds at his disposal – [...] "Madjo had <b>done</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> impress all those at Cheltenham, but thanks to the extra money made available to Keith Downing, Cheltenham have set their requirements higher".|$|E
2500|$|Deburau's great successes {{had come}} in the [...] "pantomime-féerie", {{featuring}} frenetic (sometimes violent) action in a fairy-land of transformations, tricks, and triumphs. [...] Legrand's talents lay elsewhere. [...] It was in the subtle, even touching, dramas of his Pierrot that he found his métier, {{and it was in}} the [...] "realistic" [...] pantomime that he excelled. [...] At the Folies-Nouvelles he came into his maturity, as another review by Gautier suggests; this is of Pierrot Dandin (1854), written by the mime and Charles Bridault, and the review should be quoted at length:... what absolutely must be seen is Paul Legrand in Pierrot Dandin. [...] We doubt whether Tiercelin, who played cobblers so well that it is said he could have been transferred to the shoemakers, was ever better at drawing on his hand-leather, at manipulating the knife and the awl, at squaring a sole, at nailing a bit of leather over a frame: one would truly think he has <b>done</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> this all his life. —But where he is superb is in the scene in which, returning home with a dress, a little shawl, and an apple turnover he has brought for his wife, he finds the conjugal nest deserted and, in place of the unfaithful spouse, a letter revealing that Madame Pierrot has left with the seducer Leander. [...] It must indeed be difficult to make people cry when one is wearing a little black skullcap, when one is sporting a face plastered with flour and a ridiculous costume. [...] Well! [...] Paul Legrand expresses his sadness in such a naïve, true, touching, and profoundly heartfelt manner that the puppet disappears, leaving only the man. [...] In the stage-boxes, the giddiest madcaps forgot to run their tongues over their green barley-sugar sticks and smothered their sobs behind their lace handkerchiefs.So devoted was Legrand to this conception of the character—as sensitive and vulnerable, his juddering heart on his sleeve—that, when he was consigned to a pantomime recalling Deburau's stage, he simply turned it into one of his own. [...] The Pierrot of Pol Mercier's Bureaucrat Pierrot (1856) was conceived as a scamp and a layabout:In the administrative bureau of a railroad, Pierrot is a very lazy, very inaccurate clerk. [...] At the office he spends all his time in distracting his colleagues and playing a thousand little tricks on them. [...] Sometimes he eats this one's lunch; sometimes he drinks that one's little carafe of wine. 1023, MS 3408, sc. 1 (unpaginated), Archives Nationales de France, Paris; tr.
