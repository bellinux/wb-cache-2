Preferment for Richard; promotion for Harry; nay, diplomatic appointments for Tom, came floating before her imagination, even while she smiled at her Alnaschar visions.|$|E
60|$|The {{promise of}} a smooth career, which my first calm {{introduction}} to Thornfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer acquaintance with the place and its inmates. Mrs. Fairfax {{turned out to be}} what she appeared, a placid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of competent education and average intelligence. My pupil was a lively child, who had been spoilt and indulged, and therefore was sometimes wayward; but as she was committed entirely to my care, and no injudicious interference from any quarter ever thwarted my plans for her improvement, she soon forgot her little freaks, and became obedient and teachable. She had no great talents, no marked traits of character, no peculiar development of feeling or taste which raised her one inch above the ordinary level of childhood; but neither had she any deficiency or vice which sunk her below it. She made reasonable progress, entertained for me a vivacious, though perhaps not very profound, affection; and by her simplicity, gay prattle, and efforts to please, inspired me, in return, with a <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> sufficient to make us both content in each other's society.|$|E

Had she told them they were likely would not have understood Kew's meaning as she did, and persisted in thinking that the two were reconciled. At any rate, whilst he and her father were still lying stricken by the blows which had prostrated them both, all questions of love and marriage had been put aside. Did she love him? She felt such a kind pity for his misfortune, such an admiration for his generous gallantry, such a remorse for her own wayward conduct and cruel behaviour towards this most honest, and kindly, and affectionate gentleman, that the sum of regard which she could bestow upon him might surely be said to amount to love. For such a union as that contemplated between them, perhaps for any marriage, no greater <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> was necessary as the common cement. Warm friendship and thorough esteem and confidence (I do not say that our young lady calculated in this matter-of-fact way) are safe properties invested in the prudent marriage stock, multiplying and bearing an increasing value with every year.

60|$|This design once {{admitted}} unriddles {{the mystery}} of the whole conduct of the Emperor's ministers with regard to France. As soon as they saw the life of the king and queen of France no longer, as they thought, in danger, they entirely changed their plan with regard to the French nation. I believe that the chiefs of the Revolution (those who led the constituting Assembly) have contrived, as far as they can do it, to give the Emperor satisfaction on this head. He keeps a continual tone and posture of menace to secure this his only point. But it must be observed, that he all along grounds his departure from the engagement at Pilnitz to the princes on the will and actions of the king and the majority of the people, without any regard to the natural and constitutional orders of the state, or to the opinions of the whole House of Bourbon. Though it is manifestly under the constraint of imprisonment and the fear of death that this unhappy man has been guilty of all those humilities which have astonished mankind, the advisers of the Emperor will consider nothing but the physical person of Louis, which, even in his present degraded and infamous state, they regard as of sufficient authority to give a complete sanction to the persecution and utter ruin of all his family, and of every person who has shown any <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> or fidelity to him or to his cause, as well as competent to destroy the whole ancient constitution and frame of the French monarchy.|$|E

When 3. 8 % citrate solution had been added at the time of preparation of stained bone-marrow specimens from normal persons or from patients with various blood diseases, an increase in the megakaryocyte count without platelet attachment was observed, showing no appreciable <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> the platelet <b>attachment.</b> Moreover, after the addition of the citrate solution, both in the case <b>of</b> a high <b>degree</b> and a low <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> the platelet <b>attachment</b> showed the same proportion <b>of</b> the <b>attachment</b> in respective case. 2. With the addition of normal human platelets in physiological saline solution at the time of preparation of stained bone-marrow specimens from hypoplastic anemia which never shows the so-called platelet formation, a high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> platelet <b>attachment</b> was observed. From these findings it has been clarified that the so-called platelet formation is a picture showing platelets in the bone marrow drawn out simply adhering to the surface of megakaryocytes, and that this platelet formation can not be used as a criterion for the determination of the magakaryocyte functions...|$|R

In comparison to standard models with constant returns to scale in matching, agent behaviour is more complex - the model generates plausible joint dynamics of employment, unemployment and participation with heterogeneity in search behaviour for workers with different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> to the labour market.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{dynamics}} <b>of</b> labor force <b>attachment</b> in the US by studying patterns of transition behavior for individuals matched month-to-month {{using data from}} the new Current Population Survey. Specifically, we examine transition behavior for four labor market states: employment, unemployment, marginal attachment (“wanting work ” but not searching), and non-attachment (“neither searching nor wanting work”). Our methods test whether various <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> among the non-employed are behaviorally distinct and illuminate the nature of dynamics among a broader set of labor market states than is usually examined. Results from the unconditional transition rates over time suggest that the breakdown of the nonemployed into three categories is a useful approach that is supported by the data. These results are confirmed and enhanced by estimation of a number of multinomial models of labor market dynamics, and by estimation and testing within a duration modeling framework that allows for dependence. Moreover, {{these findings are consistent with}} earlier results found for longer time-periods using Canadian data, although the present work adds significantly to these results by showing that neither seasonality nor duration dependence issues confound this evidence...|$|R

50|$|Macular {{degeneration}} is {{a condition}} affecting the tissues lying under the retina, while a macular hole involves damage from within the eye, at the junction between the vitreous and the retina itself. There is no {{relationship between the two}} diseases. Depending upon the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> or traction between the vitreous and the retina, there may be risk of developing a macular hole in the other eye. In those cases where the vitreous has already become separated from the retinal surface, there is very little chance of developing a macular hole in the other eye. On the other hand, when the vitreous remains adherent and pulling on the macular region in both eyes, then there may be a greater risk of developing a hole in the second eye. In very rare instances, trauma or other conditions lead {{to the development of a}} macular hole. In the vast majority of cases, however, macular holes develop spontaneously. As a result, there is no known way to prevent their development through any nutritional or chemical means, nor is there any way to know who is at risk for developing a hole prior to its appearance in one or both eyes.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{method for}} functionalising {{solution}} based polyaniline (PAni) nanofibres is reported whereby the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> side-chain <b>attachment</b> can be controllably altered. The covalent <b>attachment</b> <b>of</b> functional side-groups {{to the surface}} of PAni nanostructures is achieved by post-polymerisation reflux {{in the presence of a}} nucleophile and the functionalised nanomaterial can be purified by simple centrifugation. The technique is therefore easily scalable. We demonstrate that control over the extent <b>of</b> side-chain <b>attachment</b> can be achieved simply by altering the amount of nucleophile added during reflux. We provide evidence that covalently attached carboxlate side-chains influence the doping mechanism of polyaniline and can be used to introduce self-doping behaviour. Acid functionalised nanofibres remain redox active and retain their optical switching capabilities in response to changes in the local chemical environment, thus making them suitable for adaptive sensing applications...|$|R

As hypothesized, {{the interaction between}} women's <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> ambivalence and their perceptions of spousal support (assessed 6 weeks prior to childbirth) predicted systematic changes in men's and women's marital satisfaction and related factors over time (6 months postpartum). Specifically, if highly ambivalent (preoccupied) women entered parenthood perceiving lower levels of support from their husbands, they experienced declines in marital satisfaction. Women's ambivalence also predicted their own {{as well as their}} husbands ' marital satisfaction and functioning concurrently. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> avoidance did not significantly predict marital changes, although women's avoidance did correlate with some of the concurrent marital measures. These findings are discussed in terms of attachment theory. Attachment theory (Bowlby, 1969, 1973, 1980) proposes that interactions with caregivers in infancy, childhood, and adolescence give rise to internal working models of the self and significant others that guide behavior and perception in relationships.

40|$|This thesis {{tests the}} theory behind the new urbanist call for "modem version[s] of the {{traditional}} town" with respect to one physical design feature: the clearly defined town center. It asks the question: how does {{the existence of a}} town center, which, as prescribed by new urbanism, integrates commercial, recreational, and civic facilities in close proximity, affect sense of community in rural youth? The findings of this study, at least in part, support the new urbanist theory. Students in an area with a strong center do appear to display stronger feelings of basic need fulfillment, membership, and more positive feelings in general regarding their community. However, in other respects, students in the area without the center exhibited a much stronger sense of community, feeling much higher <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment,</b> identity, and influence. The strong sense of community exhibited by the students in an area without a center may well be a product of that area's edges, and may begin to elucidate the role of other physical (and potentially social) boundaries in fostering sense of community. by Helen Coughlin Donaldson.
