25|$|The section between Uplawmoor and Ardrossan {{limited to}} goods traffic and Ardrossan boat trains only from 1932; the boat trains were {{suspended}} during World War II. In 1947 a spur was constructed at Stevenston from the <b>G</b> <b>line</b> to the L line {{and from that}} time boat trains were routed from Glasgow via Dalry and the <b>G</b> <b>line</b> {{as far as this}} point; goods traffic continued to Auchenmade and Giffen until 1953.|$|E
25|$|On 16 June 1947 a short spur was {{installed}} near Ardeer between the G and the L lines, enabling <b>G</b> <b>line</b> boat trains to use Montgomerie Pier. Nonetheless the last boat train {{ran on the}} route on 10 September 1965, and the L route between Stevenston and Ardrossan closed completely on 18 April 1966.|$|E

25|$|The line {{left the}} City of Glasgow Union Railway (CGUR) at Shields Junction (at {{the point where}} the CGUR joined the joint line) and {{followed}} a course south of that route, running through the southern part of Paisley Burgh and rejoining the <b>G</b> <b>line</b> to Ayr at Elderslie. As the CGUR was controlled by the G, G passenger trains from St Enoch, and goods trains from College, could reach Ayr without the necessity of entering on any part of the joint line. Despite the easing of the worst curvature, the new Canal Line was unsuited to fast running due to the alignment. A loop in the canal was used to hold cooling water for the cotton thread mills at Ferguslie.|$|E

500|$|To {{increase}} {{service and}} reduce waiting time {{due to the}} 63rd Street Connector cutbacks, the G would need more trains, but there were not enough cars available in the system. The solution was to reduce the length of trains {{in order to increase}} service frequency. Historically, the <b>G</b> <b>line</b> had run 8 [...] car trains or 6 [...] car trains; both were shorter than the typical [...] length of B Division trains because ridership was deemed too low to justify running full-length G trains in frequent intervals. Under the 2001 plan, trains were shortened from six [...] cars to four, sticking all the leftover cars together to make the extra trains for the G, and the additional trains needed for V service. Thus, G service now operates [...] trains, half the length of normal B Division standards. It also operates One Person Train Operation (OPTO) service during late nights and weekends.|$|E

500|$|Mass {{transportation}} {{throughout the}} Denver metropolitan area is managed and coordinated by the Regional Transportation District (RTD). RTD operates more than 1,000 buses serving over 10,000 bus stops in 38 municipal jurisdictions in eight counties around the Denver and Boulder metropolitan areas. Additionally, RTD operates nine rail lines, the A, B, C, D, E, F, R, W, and H {{with a total}} of [...] of track, serving 44 stations. All lines are Light Rail except the A Line and B Line which are Commuter Rail, with the <b>G</b> <b>Line</b> to the suburb of Arvada, opening soon pending federal approval in 2017, and the N Line to Commerce City and Thorton, soon to open in 2018. FasTracks is a Commuter Rail, Light Rail and Bus expansion project approved by voters in 2004 which will serve neighboring suburbs and communities. The W line, or West line, opened in April 2013 serving Golden/Federal Center. An Express Bus Service, known as the Flatiron Flyer, serves to connect Boulder and Denver. The service, billed as Bus Rapid Transit, has been accused of Bus rapid transit creep for failing to meet the majority of BRT requirements, including level boarding and all-door entry. A Commuter Rail connection to Boulder and its suburb of Longmont, also part of the FasTracks ballot initiative and an extension of the B Line, is to be finished sometime after 2040. [...] In addition, the N Line, under FasTracks, is another Commuter Rail line currently under construction with an expected completion date in 2018 and will serve the suburbs of Commerce City and Thorton.|$|E

2500|$|Diamonds {{are usually}} cut into brilliants {{to bring out}} their {{brilliance}} (the amount of light reflected back to the viewer) and fire (the degree to which colorful prismatic flashes are seen). Both properties are strongly affected by the cut of the stone, {{but they are a}} function of diamond's high refractive index (RI—the degree to which incident light is bent upon entering the stone) of 2.417 (as measured by sodium light, 589.3nm) and high dispersion (the degree to which white light is split into its spectral colors as it passes through the stone) of 0.044, as measured by the sodium B and <b>G</b> <b>line</b> interval. Thus, if a diamond simulant's RI and dispersion are too low, it will appear comparatively dull or [...] "lifeless"; if the RI and dispersion are too high, the effect will be considered unreal or even tacky. Very few simulants have closely approximating RI and dispersion, and even the close simulants can be separated by an experienced observer. Direct measurements of RI and dispersion are impractical (a standard gemological refractometer has an upper limit of about RI 1.81), but several companies have devised reflectivity meters to gauge a material's RI indirectly by measuring how well it reflects an infrared beam.|$|E
