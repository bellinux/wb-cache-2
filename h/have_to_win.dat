5|$|In the quarter-finals, Barcelona {{were drawn}} against their fellow leading-scorers in the competition, Bayern Munich, who had beaten Barcelona's group stage opposition, Sporting CP, 12–1 on {{aggregate}} {{in the previous}} round. However, despite Bayern's impressive scoring record, goals from Messi and Eto'o gave Barcelona a 2–0 lead within the first 12minutes. Messi and Henry also scored to seal a 4–0 home victory before half-time. The lack of an away goal meant Bayern Munich would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> by five clear goals {{to qualify for the}} semi-finals. After a goalless first half, they took the lead through Franck Ribéry in the 47thminute, but it was not enough for Bayern as Keita equalised in the 73rdminute to clinch a 5–1 aggregate win for the Spanish side.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the keys}} to the game, {{according}} to ESPN.com blogger Matt Fortuna, was to stop the run. Both teams had 1,000+ yard rushers (Zach Line for SMU, Robbie Rouse for Fresno State), but SMU's rush defense (24th in FBS) was better than Fresno State's (73rd in FBS). Many analysts predicted that Fresno State would emerge victorious, some going as far as to predict a blowout, but said that for SMU to emerge victorious, they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the field position battle as well as create turnovers.|$|E
5|$|The tournament sees players {{competing}} {{for their country}} in four singles and one doubles matches, known as rubbers, {{over the course of}} three days, with the team that wins three rubbers progressing. The countries are divided into groups based upon their location or performance in previous years. The Davis Cup World Group is the top level of the competition and features matches between players from the top 16 countries {{at the start of the}} year. Countries that lose their first round match face a relegation play-off against winning countries from the continental zones. World Group winning countries progress to the quarter-finals. Nations <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> a further three ties in order to claim the position of Davis Cup Champions.|$|E

5|$|On 10 October, the High Court {{ruled that}} the act passed at the joint sitting that gave the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and the Northern Territory two {{senators}} each was valid. A half-Senate election needed to be held by June 1976; most senators-elect would take their seats on 1 July but the territorial senators, and those filling Field's and Bunton's seats would take their places at once. The ruling meant {{that it was possible}} for the ALP to gain a temporary majority in the Senate, at least until 1 July 1976. To do so, the ALP would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> Field's and Bunton's seats, and one seat in each territory, and have the second ACT seat fall to either a Labor candidate or an independent, former Liberal Prime Minister John Gorton, now estranged from his party. If this happened, Labor would have an effective 33–31 margin, would be able to pass supply if that was still an issue, and also could pass electoral redistribution laws (which had been passed by the House, though twice defeated by the Senate) that would give it an advantage at the next election.|$|E
5|$|The {{championship}} {{then moved}} to the penultimate round at the Swedish Grand Prix with Spencer holding a two-point lead over Roberts. Roberts led Spencer going into the last lap of the race. Heading down the back straight, Spencer placed his Honda right behind Roberts' Yamaha {{as they reached the}} second to the last corner, a ninety degree right-hander. As both riders applied their brakes, Spencer came out of Roberts' slipstream and managed to get inside of the Yamaha. As they exited the corner, both riders ran wide off the track and into the dirt. Spencer was able {{to get back on the}} track and back on the power first, crossing the finish line just ahead of Roberts for a crucial victory. Roberts considered Spencer's pass to be foolish and dangerous, and exchanged angry words with him on the podium. Roberts would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the final round at the San Marino Grand Prix with Spencer finishing no better than third place in order for Roberts to win his fourth world championship. In a fitting end to a great career, Roberts won his last-ever Grand Prix race, however Spencer was able to secure second place to claim the world championship. The two riders dominated the season with each claiming six victories in the 12 race series.|$|E
25|$|The three-time Super Bowl {{champion}} Patriots, who for {{the first}} time in their previous three playoff trips would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> three games to advance to the Super Bowl, defeated the Jaguars 28–3. Linebacker Willie McGinest set NFL playoff records for sacks in a game (4.5, one ahead of the old record held by Richard Dent and Rich Milot) and career postseason sacks (16, two ahead of the old record held by Bruce Smith), while quarterback Tom Brady threw for 201 yards and three touchdown passes.|$|E

25|$|On 29 April 1978, {{the final}} match {{day of the}} 1977–78 Fußball-Bundesliga season, Borussia Mönchengladbach played Borussia Dortmund with the {{possibility}} of winning the Bundesliga championship. Knowing that if 1. FC Köln won their game away to FC St. Pauli, Borussia Mönchengladbach would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> by a margin well in excess of ten goals. The match finished 12–0, which remains the largest margin of victory and tied with four other matches for the biggest win in Bundesliga history. However, 1. FC Köln beat FC St. Pauli 5–0 to become champions.|$|E
25|$|Since the Panthers {{finished}} with the third best regular season record in the NFC, they had to win three playoff games to reach the Super Bowl. The St. Louis Rams and the Philadelphia Eagles had better regular season records at 12–4, and thus under the playoff format, each would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> two playoff games to reach the league championship game. Against Carolina's first opponent, the Dallas Cowboys, Delhomme threw for 273 yards and a touchdown, Davis recorded 104 rushing yards and a touchdown, and kicker John Kasay made 5 field goals, {{en route to a}} thorough 29–10 victory.|$|E
25|$|The Zags {{ended the}} regular season at 21–10, their first season with double digits in losses since 1997–98, which was also the last season to date in which they {{failed to make the}} NCAA tournament. It had {{generally}} been thought that Gonzaga would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the WCC tournament to earn a bid to the NCAA tournament. However, Gonzaga would go on to win the conference tournament, notably beating a Santa Clara team in the final that had earlier handed the Zags their first home-court loss in nearly four years. They would go out {{in the first round of}} the NCAA tournament to Indiana.|$|E
50|$|Before 1999, players <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> 30 tournaments, {{including}} two majors; 35 tournaments with one major; or 40 tournaments in all to automatically qualify.

25|$|An {{abandonment}} at Warwickshire left Essex {{with enough}} points {{to be certain}} of promotion, but The Eagles would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> away at Kent {{to be sure of}} winning the league. The match was notable for the huge level of away support Essex received, a rarity in domestic cricket. Despite an unbeaten Rob Key century and the fact Essex lost captain Mark Pettini on the first ball of their own innings, Essex managed to score the 247 needed for victory thanks to an unbeaten 68 from veteran Grant Flower, as well as fifties from Jason Gallian and Ravi Bopara, to pick up the Pro40 Division 2 title.|$|E
25|$|Match V: CSK {{played against}} the sulking Delhi Daredevils who are {{struggling}} to record their first win this season. CSK chose to bat first after winning the toss and set a pretty solid target of 170. Michael Hussey and Mahendra Singh Dhoni played their ace game with good support from Suresh Raina. DD started their wobbly innings with David Warner cheaply gone for 1 run and wickets continued to fall in short intervals. DD succumbed to a meager 83. This could be considered {{as one of the}} worst performances of DD and they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> 9 of the next 10 games they have ahead of them.|$|E
25|$|The NCAA tournament has {{undergone}} dramatic expansion since 1975, {{and since the}} tournament was expanded to 48 teams in 1980, no unbeaten teams have failed to qualify. (As, by definition, a team would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> its conference tournament, and thus secure an automatic bid to the tournament, to be undefeated in a season, the only way a team could finish undefeated and not reach the tournament is if the team is banned from postseason play; as of 2016, no team banned from postseason play has finished undefeated since 1980.) Before that, there were occasions on which a team achieved perfection in the regular season, yet did {{not appear in the}} NCAA tournament.|$|E

25|$|On {{its return}} from Brazil, South Melbourne {{failed to make}} the finals in the 1999/2000 season, {{finishing}} well outside the top six finals spots. Before the new season started Postecoglou left South Melbourne in order to take up the position of Australian youth coach, and was replaced by former South player and teammate Mike Petersen. At the end of the 2000/01 home and away season, South had finished a comfortable 8 points clear of Wollongong, but lost both legs of its major semi final against the Wolves 2–1, meaning South would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the prelimanary final in order to earn a rematch. South duly did so with a 2–0 victory over Sydney Olympic, but in the grand final put in a lacklustre performance, once more losing 2–1.|$|E
25|$|Over time, {{other sites}} started to expand beyond eSports betting and instead offered betting on games of chance. Jackpot-like sites were introduced, where users can put their skins into the pot, which {{will end in}} one person winning. The higher total value, the more chance the user would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>win.</b> A few sites reduced the {{gambling}} to betting on {{the result of a}} single coin flip. Some sites also offered unopened weapon crates for purchase with skins. In combination with the gambling features, players could then trade skins they won for their cash value through these sites, or purchase skins with currency to gamble further. The exact timing for the growth of these gambling sites is unclear, but Chris Grove, an analyst for Eilers & Krejcik Gaming and Narus Advisors, observed as early as August 2015 that skins were being used for betting on eSports. At that time, the use of skins for gambling on more traditional games-of-chance was not readily apparent.|$|E
25|$|Despite their {{progress}} in the cups, Chelsea's Premier League form remained indifferent, with draws with Tottenham and Arsenal and a home loss to Newcastle effectively ended their chances of finishing in the top four of the League table. This meant that they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the Champions League to secure qualification for the following season's competition. In the FA Cup final, Chelsea faced Liverpool. Chelsea were the better team for the first hour; Ramires put them ahead early in the match, {{and in the second}} half Didier Drogba doubled the lead. Despite Liverpool halving the deficit with an Andy Carroll strike, Chelsea held out to win their seventh FA Cup, largely thanks to heroics from goalkeeper Petr Čech, who pulled off the save of the season to narrowly deny Andy Carroll an equaliser; this was Chelsea's fourth success in the competition in six seasons and the best record of any club in the competition since Wanderers won it five times in seven years in the nineteenth century.|$|E

25|$|In April 1978 then-Transport Minister Otto Lang {{announced}} at {{a speech to}} the Board of Trade a plan to provide daily scheduled airline service between the airport and Ottawa and Montreal, using de Havilland Dash 7 STOL planes. The Government of Canada would invest $5 million in improvements at the airport including a covered moving pedestrian sidewalk linking the airport with Lake Shore Boulevard. Great Lakes Airlines proposed buying seven Dash 7s on the condition that the government subsidize the service at a rate of $8 million per year for the first three or four years. Lang stipulated that the plan would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> local approval, and conceded that it may not be profitable before 1990. Local proponents at the time were the Toronto Board of Trade and unionized workers at the de Havilland plant in Downsview. Toronto City Council, notably Alderman Pat Sheppard, representing local residents of the airport, opposed the airport. Even several commissioners of the Harbour Commission, including Roy Merrens and Karl Jaffary opposed the plan. In August, Toronto City Council voted 16–6 against the STOL proposal and proposed planning amendments to prevent any STOL development. It meant the end, at least temporarily, for Lang's proposal.|$|E
25|$|Man Utd's {{game against}} Aston Villa was the late {{kick-off}} on 29 March, which allowed Arsenal {{to pull back}} United's lead in the league to just three points with a 3–2 win over Bolton. This meant that the Red Devils would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> to restore their six-point lead over Arsenal; and win they did, as they put four goals past Martin O'Neill's side. Villa were first to threaten either goal, but it took just 16 minutes for Cristiano Ronaldo to get the opener, back-heeling the ball through Martin Laursen's legs and past Scott Carson in the Villa goal. Ronaldo then turned provider for the second goal on 33 minutes, Carlos Tevez heading home the Portuguese's cross at the back post. The loudest cheers of the game, though, did not come until after half-time, as Wayne Rooney, who had not scored at Old Trafford since October, bagged a brace. Ronaldo supplied the first, back-heeling {{the ball to the}} England striker, who rounded Carson before passing the ball into the net. Ronaldo then provided the assist for Rooney's second, nutmegging an Aston Villa defender to play Rooney in. Heartened by his first goal in six games, Rooney finished the move with a cool shot, beating Carson on his near post. Rooney almost made it a hat-trick a few minutes later, but he was deemed to be marginally offside at the time of Owen Hargreaves' cross.|$|E
25|$|With the Ashes now contested {{across all}} three formats, the drawn Test meant that England would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the {{combined}} ODI and Twenty20 match series at least 8-4 (2 points for a win) {{to win back}} the Ashes. They began badly in the first ODI at Lords, where Australia batted first and scored 203-8, due to good performances from Katherine Brunt and Marsh with the ball. England began well if a little slowly but faded against the Australian spinners, as despite 61 from Edwards, they slumped to a 27 run defeat. England came back strongly in the second ODI at Hove, batting first and making 256-6 in their 50 overs. Edwards led the way with her 6th consecutive ODI fifty, {{with all of the}} top six making at least 26. Brunt and Anya Shrubsole then dismissed both openers, including the dangerous Meg Lanning for zero, and despite 81 from Jess Cameron, England won by 51 runs, although Marsh injured her shoulder and missed the remainder of the series. The final ODI again took place at Hove, and after rain reduced the game to 36 overs a side, Australia scored an imposing 203-4, led by Lanning's 64. The Australia innings was notable for the remarkable dismissal of Australian captain Jodie Fields, who was brilliantly caught one-handed by Taylor as Fields attempted to reverse sweep Danielle Hazell. England chased down this target impressively, as after Edwards early dismissal, Knight and Taylor combined for a partnership of 126 in 18 overs. They fell for 69 and 64 respectively, but Sciver and Gunn saw England home and into a series lead.|$|E
