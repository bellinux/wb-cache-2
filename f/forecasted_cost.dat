We offer algorithm for closing gaps {{in the process of}} bringing the planned and <b>forecasted</b> <b>cost</b> of the product to its target value. Different variants of the integrated management accounting system have been studied basing on the method of target cost of the product calculation.

40|$|This work {{develops}} a new methodology {{to minimize the}} life cycle cost of a product using the decision variables controlled by a reliability/quality professional during a product development process. This methodology incorporates all product dependability-related activities into a comprehensive probabilistic cost model that enables minimization of the product's life cycle cost using the product dependability control variables. The primary model inputs include the cost of ownership of test equipment, <b>forecasted</b> <b>cost</b> of warranty returns, and environmental test parameters of a product validation program. Among these parameters, an emphasis is placed upon test duration and test sample size for durability related environmental tests. The warranty forecasting model is based on data mining of past warranty claims, parametric probabilistic analysis of the existing field data, and a piecewise application of several statistical distributions. The modeling process is complicated by insufficient knowledge {{about the relationship between}} product quality and product reliability. This {{can be attributed to the}} lack of studies establishing the effect of product validation activities on future field failures, overall lack of comprehensive field failure studies, and the market's dictation of warranty terms as opposed to warranties based on engineering rationale. As a result of these complicating factors an innovative approach to estimating the quality-reliability relationship using probabilistic methods and stochastic simulation has been developed. The overall cost model and its minimization are generated using a Monte Carlo method that accounts for the propagation of uncertainties from the model inputs and their parameters to the life cycle cost solution. This research provides reliability and quality professionals with a methodology to evaluate the efficiency of a product validation program from a life cycle cost point of view and identifies ways to improve the validation test flow by adjusting test durations, sample sizes, and equipment utilization. Solutions balance a rigorous theoretical treatment and practical applications and are specifically applied to the electronics industry...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Oversight Procedure (OP) is to {{describe}} the review, analysis, and recommendation procedures and reporting requirements expected by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) from the Project Management Oversight Contractor (PMOC) as regards risk associated with the Grantee’s project and the Grantee’s plan for mitigating and managing risks through various means {{including the use of}} cost and schedule contingencies. 2. 0 BACKGROUND The reliability of the Grantee’s project scope, cost estimate, and schedule {{over the course of the}} project life is extremely important, not only for the success of the individual project, but also for the professional credibility of the transit industry including FTA. 3. 0 OBJECTIVES This review requires an evaluation of the reliability of the Grantee’s project scope, cost estimate, and schedule, with special focus on the elements of uncertainty associated with the effectiveness and efficiency of the Grantee’s project implementation and within the context of the surrounding project conditions. This OP requires the PMOC to synthesize available project information; explore and analyze uncertainties and risks; provide a qualitative and quantitative assessment of ranges of <b>forecasted</b> <b>cost</b> and schedule; describe the analytical methods used; consider risk mitigation options and alternatives including use of cost and schedule contingencies; draw conclusions; and provide recommendations for adjustment to scope, cost, schedule project delivery method, construction methodology, and project management planning in order to respond to project risk. FTA may direct the PMOC to conduct this review prior to major milestones in a project’s life. This review is useful for projects using any project delivery method: Design-Build-Build (DBB), Design-Build (DB), Construction Manager/General Contractor (CM/GC), etc. The PMOC’s review under this OP is a critical input to FTA’s decision regarding project advancement and funding...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Operating <b>cost</b> <b>forecasts</b> {{are used}} in {{economic}} feasibility studies of projects and in budgeting process.

40|$|Since the {{terrorist}} attack on USS COLE (DDG 67) and more recently the attacks on New York City and the Pentagon, Antiterrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP) requirements have increased dramatically throughout the Department of Defense (DOD).

One method for <b>forecasting</b> <b>cost</b> {{reductions}} uses {{the concept of the}} ‘experience’ curve.

However, the errors found in transportation projects in Thailand are significantly different in magnitude from those in the Philippines. The level and frequency of <b>cost</b> <b>forecast</b> errors in the two countries were examined as well.

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a manufacturer who sells a product to a retailer {{in a single}} selling season. Each party obtains a forecast of the market demand independent of each other. We study three different forecast scenarios: Non-Information Sharing, Information Sharing, and Retailer Forecasting cases. In the first scenario, both parties make their forecasts, but do not share the information with the other firm. In the second scenario, they share the information with each other, while in the last scenario, only the retailer makes the forecast, and shares it with the manufacturer. Noting that the forecast accuracy comes at a cost, we derive the optimal price and forecast accuracy level {{for each of the}} three cases. We then compare the optimal policies of the three cases and derive conditions under which the two parties should share information with each other.
