5|$|After a broad {{review of}} its {{tactical}} force structure, the U.S. Air Force decided {{to adopt a}} low-cost aircraft to supplement the F-4 and F-111. It first focused on the Northrop F-5, which had air-to-air capability. A 1965 cost-effectiveness study shifted the focus from the F-5 to the less expensive LTV A-7D, and a contract was awarded. However, this aircraft doubled <b>in</b> <b>cost</b> with demands for an upgraded engine and new avionics.|$|E

5|$|According to the Miami Herald the {{financing}} {{structure of the}} plan is notable {{for the amount of}} financial risk taken by the builders in return for the long term concession on the tunnel. Opposition to the project states that it is a waste of taxpayer money, and may become Miami's Big Dig, the nickname of a tunnel megaproject in Boston, which was a $4 billion project that ended up costing $22 billion <b>in</b> <b>cost</b> overruns. Many believe that the Port of Miami Tunnel Project will be likely to have similar cost overruns, even though the Secretary of the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) promised that the project would finish on time and without overruns. They also state that truck traffic is not a problem in Downtown, and that since 1991 car and truck traffic had reduced significantly.|$|E
5|$|By March 2004 {{the cost}} {{had reached the}} sum of £430m (compared to an {{original}} budget of £55m in July 1998 when the architects were appointed). This equates to £85 {{for each of the}} 5.1 million people in Scotland. A report published by the Auditor General for Scotland in July 2004 specifically identified elements that contributed to both increasing costs and the delay in completing the project. His report criticised the overall management of the project and stated that had the management and construction process been executed better, costs could have been reduced. The report attempted to identify the reasons why there had been an acceleration <b>in</b> <b>cost</b> from £195m in September 2000 to £431m in February 2004 and concluded that over 2000 design changes to the project were a major factor. The building was finally certified for occupation in the Summer of 2004, with the official opening in October of the same year, three years behind schedule.|$|E

5|$|Fundraising {{efforts were}} led by Achsah M. Ely, {{a member of the}} college's class of 1868 and a {{professor}} of math at the school from 1887–1904. Donations came {{from a variety of sources}} including students attending the college (the class of 1889 donated a total of $148), student groups (the Philaletheis Society, the college's student dramatic organization, contributed $41 dollars in the hopes it could use the building once completed), trustees, and alumnae and their families. By June 1887, the college had raised between $18,000–20,000 and so hired architect William Tubby to design the new hall. Tubby returned to the college with estimates from Poughkeepsie builders ranging <b>in</b> <b>cost</b> from $39,997–50,000, higher than the available budget. The Vassar Board of Trustees formed a subcommittee and attempted to find solutions, including modifying Tubby's designs. The subcommittee received estimates from builders outside of Poughkeepsie (in Kingston, Brooklyn, Troy, and Albany) but the lowest was still above budget at $32,000.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the RTA (since re-branded as Sound Transit) began {{exploring}} alignment {{options for}} the Northgate segment, with residents voicing their opposition to at-grade or elevated alignments {{in favor of an}} underground route. Following several rounds of public hearings in 2000, the Sound Transit Board narrowed down the routing options to a tunnel under 12th Avenue and an elevated alignment along Interstate 5 to the west of Roosevelt's commercial district, each with a station at Northeast 65th Street. Further discussion on the two remaining choices in 2004 led to divides in the Sound Transit Board; community and business groups in Roosevelt favored an underground alignment, while Seattle mayor Greg Nickels supported the elevated station, which was less costly and closer to the Green Lake neighborhood. On January 28, 2005, the Sound Transit Board unanimously approved an underground alignment with a station along 12th Avenue NE between NE 65th and 67th streets, citing a smaller-than-expected difference <b>in</b> <b>cost</b> compared to the elevated option.|$|E

The ZX81 had been designed to meet a £70 price point and was launched at a price of £69.95 (built) or £49.95 (kit). One Sinclair brochure presented a side-by-side comparison of the ZX81 with the four machines that Sinclair considered its main rivals – the Acorn Atom, Apple II Plus, Commodore PET and TRS-80. The comparison highlighted the vast differences <b>in</b> <b>cost,</b> from £630 {{in the case of the}} Apple II Plus to just £70 for the ZX81, though even by Sinclair's own comparison the Apple was by far the more capable machine.|$|E
5|$|Public {{opposition}} to the project was broad. The Adelaide City Council objected to the plan {{on the basis that}} it would interfere with the well-designed layout of the city proper. In response, the government altered the plan to redirect the line underneath the city, at a considerable increase <b>in</b> <b>cost.</b> Residents in inner-city suburbs such as St Peters were concerned about the noise of the light rail vehicles, and protested against any disruption of the Torrens Gorge in the Modbury corridor. Test drilling commenced for the tunnel, but the entire light rail project was halted in 1980 after Premier David Tonkin appointed Michael Wilson, an opponent of the plan, as Transport Minister.|$|E

In 2006–07 Serie B, Napoli made its first profit of €1,416,976 The first Serie A season back Napoli had a net profit of €11,911,041 It followed with a net profit of €10,934,520, due to the income from European matches which was offset by the increase <b>in</b> <b>cost.</b> In 2009–10 season, Napoli heavily invested on players, and made that season a net profit of just €343,686. In 2010–11 Serie A, Napoli returned to the right track with €4,197,829 net profit. It was due to the new collective TV rights of Serie A, as well as qualification to 2010–11 UEFA Europa League.|$|E

40|$|Final reportCost estimates, {{including}} both monetary and nonmonetary quality-of-life costs specific to Michigan, were estimated for overall traffic crashes and index crimes by {{experts in the}} field of economics of traffic crashes and crimes. These cost estimates were applied to 2009 Michigan traffic crash and index crime incidence data to estimate dollar losses from traffic crashes and index crimes to the state and for each county within the state. Crash costs associated with alcohol-involved traffic crashes, teen-driver-involved crashes, crash-involved motorcyclists, and unrestrained occupants of passenger vehicles were also calculated. Findings indicate that in 2009, index crimes in Michigan resulted in $ 1. 9 billion <b>in</b> monetary <b>costs</b> and $ 4. 7 billion in total (monetary and nonmonetary quality-of-life) costs. Overall traffic crashes resulted in $ 4. 8 billion <b>in</b> monetary <b>costs</b> and $ 9. 1 billion <b>in</b> total <b>costs.</b> Of these costs, alcohol-involved crashes accounted for $ 0. 8 billion <b>in</b> monetary <b>costs</b> and $ 1. 9 billion <b>in</b> total <b>costs.</b> Crashes involving teen drivers accounted for almost $ 1 billion <b>in</b> monetary <b>costs</b> and $ 1. 8 billion <b>in</b> total <b>costs.</b> Crash-involved motorcyclists accounted for $ 0. 4 billion <b>in</b> monetary <b>costs</b> and $ 0. 8 billion <b>in</b> total <b>costs.</b> Injury-crash involved unrestrained occupants accounted for $ 0. 5 billion <b>in</b> monetary <b>costs</b> and $ 1. 2 billion <b>in</b> total <b>costs.</b> Based on dollar losses to the state, the magnitude of the problem of traffic crashes exceeded that of index crimes in 2009...|$|R

40|$|Original title: Kosten in kaart. Towards {{the end of}} the 1990 s, the {{efficiency}} of public provisions - the relationship between output and costs - received an increasing amount of attention, mainly in response to the steep rise <b>in</b> <b>costs.</b> This publication focuses on the trend <b>in</b> the <b>costs</b> of public provisions: what are the background to the changes <b>in</b> those <b>costs?</b> The traditional approach, based on national cost figures, was refined for this purpose by incorporating more detailed information about institutions. This provides a clear insight into the factors which determine the trend <b>in</b> <b>costs.</b> The analysis method developed is applied to figures for institutions for people with intellectual disabilities in the period 1984 - 1998. The major changes that have taken place in the sector mean that more recent figures are not available.
