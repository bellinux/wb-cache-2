Xander enters Giles' {{apartment}} as Spike, his mouth wet with blood, bends <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up something that he dropped {{in front of the}} sofa where Anya sleeps. Inferring that Spike bit and drank from Anya, Xander pummels him ferociously until Anya wakes and stops him; excited that he fought to defend her, Anya gestures that they should go have sex.|$|E
25|$|When the {{helicopter}} landed, Cleland jumped out, {{followed by the}} two soldiers. They ducked beneath the rotors and turned to watch the liftoff. Cleland reached <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up a grenade that he believed had popped off his flak jacket. It exploded and the blast slammed him backward, shredding both his legs and one arm.|$|E
25|$|When Hrólfr {{heard that}} Aðils refused to pay, {{he set off}} to Uppsala. They brought the ships to the river Fyris and rode {{directly}} to the Swedish king's hall at Uppsala with his twelve berserkers. Yrsa welcomed them and led them to their lodgings. Fires were prepared for them and they were given drinks. However, so much wood was heaped on the fires that the clothes started to burn away from their bodies. Hrólfr and his men had enough and threw the courtiers on the fire. Yrsa arrived and gave them a horn full of gold, the ring Svíagris {{and asked them to}} flee. As they rode over the Fyrisvellir, they saw Aðils and his men pursuing them. The fleeing men threw their gold on the plain so that the pursuers would stop to collect the gold. Aðils, however, continued the chase on his horse Slöngvir. Hrólfr then threw Svíagris and saw how Aðils stooped <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up the ring with his spear. Hrólfr exclaimed that he had seen the mightiest man in Sweden bend his back.|$|E

Some treatments took much longer than others, so it was <b>down</b> <b>to</b> teams <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> the shortest treatment possible. Whatever the massage could finish with no pain, a masseuse would receive their next clue.|$|R
2500|$|The {{prosecutors}} had also drafted an affidavit {{for the trial}} judge in response to Foster's motion for a new trial. It contained the statement: [...] "If it comes <b>down</b> <b>to</b> having <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> one of the black jurors, [...] might be okay. This is solely my opinion .... Upon picking of the jury after listening {{to all of the}} jurors we had <b>to</b> <b>pick,</b> if we had <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> a black juror I recommend that [...] be one of the jurors." [...] The statement was crossed-out by hand and was omitted in the affidavit filed with the court.|$|R

500|$|His despair gone, Bemis contentedly sorts {{the books}} he {{looks forward to}} reading for years to come. Just as he bends <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up the first book, he stumbles, and his glasses fall off and shatter. In shock, {{he picks up the}} broken remains of the glasses he is {{virtually}} blind without, and says, [...] "That's not fair. That's not fair at all. There was time now. There was—was all the time I needed…! It's not fair! [...] It's not fair!" [...] and bursts into tears, surrounded by books he now can never read.|$|E
500|$|The wolf, {{after some}} complaint, agrees {{to this and}} the two proceed through the woods after the prize—all the while the fox {{considers}} how to trick the wolf. Eventually, as the wolf complains of the fruitlessness of their quest, they arrive at a [...] with buckets on each end of a rope. Seeing {{the reflection of the}} moon in the water {{at the bottom of the}} well, the wolf believes there to be cheese down there and lowers the fox <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> it up. When he complains that it is too heavy for him to lift alone, the wolf jumps into the other bucket and descends to help. However, this pulls up the other bucket, into which the fox has jumped, and so the two swap places; the wolf at the bottom of the well and the fox safely escaped. The narrator professes that he does not know who helped the wolf out of the well, but that the tale is at an end.|$|E
2500|$|The Chargers then {{countered with}} a 72-yard drive ending with Benirschke's 27-yard field goal. The Raiders defense was {{exhausted}} and they implored their offense by saying [...] "don't {{let them have}} the damn ball back"! The Raiders then held onto the ball for the last 6:52 of the game on a 15-play drive (12 runs, one pass, two quarterback kneels), with Plunkett scrambling twice on third <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up key first downs, to clinch the victory.|$|E

The Antonov returned to Prince George three months later with the helicopters.|$|R
5|$|ML Pin {{recalled}} {{in his autobiography}} that although {{his mother was a}} kind and loving figure, his father was rather strict and acted more like a teacher than a father, and that he was often fearful of him. A loyal servant of the crown, MR Pia introduced ML Pin to King Vajiravudh when he was seven years old. Another often-recounted story from his childhood is that of how, before having learned to count, when his mother asked him to gather half a bunch of betel leaves for her, ML Pin set <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>picking</b> up one leaf with each hand at a time, separating them equally into two piles.|$|R
25|$|The Celtic Tiger {{started in}} the mid-1990s and boomed until 2001, when it slowed <b>down,</b> only <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up again in 2003.

2500|$|When {{the banquet}} had lasted for three days, Urse and Roluo escaped from Uppsala, {{early in the}} morning in {{carriages}} where they had put all the Swedish king's treasure. In order to lessen their burden, and to occupy any pursuing warriors they spread gold in their path (later in the work, this is referred to as [...] "sowing the Fyrisvellir"), although there was a rumour that she only spread gilded copper. When Athislus, who was pursuing the escapers saw that a precious ring was lying on the ground, he bent <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> it up. Roluo was pleased to see the king of Sweden bent down, and escaped in the ships with his mother.|$|E
2500|$|King {{made a great}} {{start to}} his Premier League career as he opened up with an 8–1 victory over Sky {{wildcard}} Wayne Mardle. He {{then went on to}} record three more victories on the bounce beating James Wade 8–1, John Part 8-2 and Jelle Klaasen 8–4. He then faced defending champion Phil Taylor in Newcastle, recording a 7–7 draw despite leading 7–5 with both players averaging over 100. King's form then dropped, only winning two more games in Birmingham and Glasgow against Mardle and Wade respectively. King was also a controversial figure during the tournament, often letting the crowd get to him and affect his mood and darts. During a 2009 Premier League match with Taylor, he threw a dart over Taylor as he stooped <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up his flight. During the post-match interview, neither of them would look at each other. Another Premier League crowd at Newcastle in 2010 appeared to shake him with taunts that resulted in him stopping mid-throw and making gestures towards the fans. Five-time world champion Eric Bristow claimed that King [...] "needs a strait jacket" [...] after the performance. His final position of 4th in the league was influenced by the illness of Mardle, as he was withdrawn from the competition. Therefore, all results that included Mardle were annulled, including King's two victories over Mardle. King's fourth place in the overall league meant that he faced Taylor in the play-off semi-finals at the Wembley Arena. King won 10–6 to end Taylor's winning streak in Premier League competitions. Despite this victory he was to finish runner-up as he lost the final 13–8 to Wade, who beat Raymond van Barneveld 10–8 in the other semi-final. Wade led King 8–2 before a mini comeback from King but Wade was able to see the game out to claim his maiden Premier League Darts title.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, {{companies}} have realised {{the significance of the}} image they represent and besides building the brands of their products, they started to concentrate on forming the brand of the company. As I am fascinated by the power of brands and their effect on consumers, I would like to explore the world of corporate branding. I would like to examine this topic in connection with two FMCG giants that have recently started to put stronger emphasis on the building of their corporate brand. I have assumed that from the viewpoint of some customers, choosing among several products is often based on the perception of the brands and products alone and it {{has little to do with}} the corporate brand. Although, if one of the companies has a strong corporate brand, an idea built around it and its message is communicated effectively, when it comes <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>picking</b> sides, the brand of the company could be essential to decision-making. Therefore, the aim of my research is to discover the connection between consumers and brands, product brands and corporate brands; how corporate brand influence customers during purchase decision making.
