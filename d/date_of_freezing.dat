40|$|We analyze asset-backed {{commercial}} paper conduits which {{played a central}} role in the early phase of the financial crisis of 2007 - 09. Using a novel data set, we document that commercial banks set up conduits to securitize assets without transferring risks to outside investors. We find that banks achieved this by providing credit and liquidity guarantees to conduits. Consistent with the implied lack of risk transfer, we show that investors in conduits have had almost no losses during the crisis in spite of deteriorating quality of the collateral backing conduits. The guarantees to conduits were designed to avoid capital requirements and banks facing more stringent capital requirements – commercial banks – were more likely to set up conduits and do so with full guarantees. Thus, we interpret conduits as a form of regulatory arbitrage that allowed banks to take on exposure to tail risks that were systemic in nature. Consistent with such a risk-taking motive, we find that banks with more exposure to conduits had lower stock returns and greater widening of credit default swap spreads around 9 August 2007, the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>freeze</b> in the asset-backed {{commercial paper}} market and inception of the financial crisis...|$|R
25|$|Relatively speaking, Bucks County {{experiences}} warm/hot {{and humid}} summers with chilly/cold and somewhat snowy winters. Episodes of high humidity (dew point >= 70°F) occur every year during {{or close to}} the summer months, very occasionally reaching extreme (dew point >= 75°F) levels. When high-to-extreme humidity combines with air temperatures in the mid-upper 90's, dangerous heat index values of >= 105°F can sometimes result. Winter minimum air temperatures occasionally fall into the single-digits to slightly below-0°F. When the coldest temperatures combine with higher winds, wind chill values can sometimes plummet below-0°F to as cold as -20°F. Spring and fall are comparatively tranquil. The climate cools as one moves from the lower elevation, dense suburban areas in southern Bucks, to the higher elevation, rural areas of northern Bucks. Precipitation is fairly well-distributed throughout the year. The average seasonal snowfall, which can potentially occur from as early as October to as late as April, is around 2 feet in extreme southern Bucks, and around 3 feet in the highest elevations of far northern Bucks. The fall foliage season typically peaks in mid-October in northern Bucks, mid-late October in central Bucks, and late-October / early-November in southern Bucks. These dates correlate with the typical <b>date</b> <b>of</b> first <b>freeze.</b> Peak spring foliage usually occurs {{during the month of}} April, which correlates with the typical <b>date</b> <b>of</b> last <b>freeze.</b>|$|R
40|$|Lake ice {{change is}} one of the {{sensitive}} indicators of regional and global climate change. Different sources of data are used in monitoring lake ice phenology nowadays. Visible and Near Infrared bands of imagery (VNIR) are well suited for the observation of freshwater ice change, for example data from AVHRR and MODIS. Active and passive microwave data are also used for the observation of lake ice, e. g., from satellite altimetry and radiometry, backscattering coefficient from QuickSCAT, brightness temperature (Tb) from SSM/I, SMMR, and AMSR-E. Most of the studies are about lake ice cover phenology, while few studies focus on lake ice thickness. For example, Hall et al. using 5 GHz (6 cm) radiometer data showed a good relationship between Tb and ice thickness. Kang et al. found the seasonal evolution of Tb at 10. 65 GHz and 18. 7 GHz from AMSR-E to be strongly influenced by ice thickness. Many studies on lake ice phenology have been carried out since the 1970 s in cold regions, especially in Canada, the USA, Europe, the Arctic, and Antarctica. However, on the Tibetan Plateau, very little research has focused on lake ice-cover change; {{only a small number of}} published papers on Qinghai Lake ice observations.

40|$|Increases in soil {{temperature}} affect both soil biotic {{process and the}} soil hydrological cycle in the mid and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Using a three-year automatic record of {{soil temperature}} in paired forest and steppe plots along a temperature gradient from northern China to southern Siberia in Russia, collected from 2008 - 2011, we investigated how vegetation cover has impacted soil temperature at a regional scale, with focus on soil freezing/thawing timing. We {{found that there was}} a buffering effect of forests on soil temperature, as indicated by cooler soil temperatures in the warm season and warmer soil temperatures in the cold season. Forest soil thawed about 15 days later than steppe soil at the same site. At a regional scale, the onset <b>date</b> <b>of</b> soil <b>freezing</b> showed significant positive correlation with cold season soil temperature in both forest and steppe. The onset <b>date</b> <b>of</b> soil thawing was significantly negatively correlated with cold season mean daily soil temperature (DST) in the steppe, but showed no significant correlation in the forest. In terms of space-for-time-substitution, it could be implied that forest might face an increased likelihood of drought by impeding snowmelt infiltration, under the present warming trend in soil temperature.

To investigate the fundamental processes involved in the formation and stability of the deposit, experimental laboratory studies have been undertaken in the Cu-Fe-Si-Al-O slag system in equilibrium with metallic copper using an air-cooled probe technique. In the current study, the effects of bath agitation on the microstructure, morphologies of the phases, and formation of various layers across the freeze-lining deposit were studied at steady-state conditions. It appears that the changes in the fluid flow pattern through changes in shear intensities result in corresponding changes in the deposit microstructure, formation of the sealing primary phase layer, thus influencing the interface temperature between freeze-lining deposit and the liquid bath...|$|R
