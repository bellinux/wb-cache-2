25|$|Tempering is a heat {{treatment}} technique used {{to increase the}} toughness of metals. Tempers determine the ductility of the metal, and therefore how well it forms and will hold its shape without additional support. In the U.S., copper is available in six tempers: 060 soft, 1/8 hard cold rolled, 1/4 cold rolled high yield, half hard, three quarter hard, and hard. In the U.K., only three designations exist: soft, <b>half-hard,</b> and hard. Copper and its alloys are defined in the U.S. in Standard Designations for Copper and Copper Alloys by ASTM; in Europe by BS EN 1172: 1997 - 'Copper and Copper Alloys in Europe’; and in the U.K. by the British Standard Code of Practice CP143: Part12: 1970.|$|E

5000|$|Since {{it is made}} of metal, wire {{has this}} same {{hardness}} property. Most modern manufacturers of jewelry wire make the wire with a defined hardness, generally a hardness of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Historically, these numbers {{were associated with the}} number of times that the wire was pulled through a draw plate, becoming harder or stiffer each time it was drawn through the drawplate. A hardness of 0 meant that the wire had been drawn through only once and was as soft and as pliable as possible. A hardness of 4 meant that the wire had been drawn through five or more times and the wire was as stiff and as hard as possible. Most jewelry wire that is sold now is designated dead soft, <b>half-hard,</b> or hard, where dead soft is wire that is manufactured with a hardness of 0, <b>half-hard</b> is wire manufactured with a hardness of 2, and fully hardened wire is wire with a hardness of 4.|$|E
50|$|As in many things, {{no single}} wire {{is perfect for}} all applications. Soft wire is easy to bend and shape, but the {{finished}} product may be bent out of shape if squeezed. Hard wire is difficult to bend but makes permanent shapes. <b>Half-hard</b> wire is a compromise between the two. Wire-wrapped jewelry {{can be made by}} wire which is initially soft, simplifying fabrication, but later hardened by hammering or by work hardening.|$|E

50|$|Cold-rolled {{sheets and}} strips come in various conditions: full-hard, <b>half-hard,</b> quarter-hard, and skin-rolled. Full-hard rolling reduces the {{thickness}} by 50%, {{while the others}} involve less of a reduction. Skin-rolling, {{also known as a}} skin-pass, involves the least amount of reduction: 0.5-1%. It is used to produce a smooth surface, a uniform thickness, and reduce the yield point phenomenon (by preventing Lüders bands from forming in later processing). It locks dislocations at the surface and thereby reduces the possibility of formation of Lüders bands. To avoid the formation of Lüders bands it is necessary to create substantial density of unpinned dislocations in ferrite matrix. It is also used to break up the spangles in galvanized steel. Skin-rolled stock is usually used in subsequent cold-working processes where good ductility is required.|$|E
50|$|The {{first stage}} in the {{manufacturing}} of aluminium boats was to cut out the hull skins and the other sheet metal parts such as the seats using templates under a radial arm router. Sections were then formed by a brake press and swaging, to form the gunwales and hull folds. Stiffening of sheet metal panels was {{by means of a}} 3,000 ton rubber press. Extruded gunwale, keel and strake sections of the hull were initially formed in a <b>half-hard</b> condition for ease of working and drop hammering, later being placed in a curing oven to bring them to full-hard condition. The skin sections were welded on wooden jigs on which the seats, gunwales, decks and extruded sections were positioned and riveted into position. The boat was then tested in a pressure tank to reveal any water leaks. The finished craft was then painted in a temperature-controlled paint shop. de Havilland also produced the polyurethane flotation material used in the boats which shaped and fitted into position. The company was noted for its use of rivets to join sections of the craft, together with the more common use of welding. In its advertisements, de Havilland Marine referred to this riveting process by the Sealomatic name.|$|E

The “Queijo de Nisa” is a {{traditional}} Portuguese <b>half-hard</b> cheese made from raw sheep milk, coagulated with a plant rennet (Cynara cardunculus L.) and with a ripening period longer than 45 days, which received a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) in 1995. Besides the PDO cheese, in the same geographical area other <b>half-hard</b> cheeses are also produced, primarily by the same firms, from raw mixed sheep and goat’s milk coagulated with an animal rennet. The name, Nisa, comes from the municipality of Nisa, {{which has been the}} most important and traditional centre of cheese economy in North of Alentejo (Graça, 1988). The geographical production area of “Queijo de Nisa” is in a less-favoured area of eight municipalities in the North of Alentejo and the regional dairy herd has 30, 750 “merino” sheep, shared by 241 farmers. Agriculture plays a dual role, as provider both of food, and rural environmental and cultural services. It includes high nature-value farming systems, such as keeping sheep, goats and beef cattle, on wooded agro-pastoral land and Mediterranean scrub. In the geographical area we have identified three different types of cheese dairies, among processors of “Queijo de Nisa” and other processors. We have surveyed all the cheese dairies and we present the results of that survey. We compare these different types of cheese dairies in order to analyse the social, economic and territorial differentiation related to them...|$|E

40|$|Life {{predictions}} of regeneratively cooled rocket thrust chambers are normally derived from classical material fatigue principles. The failures observed in experimental thrust chambers {{do not appear}} to be due entirely to material fatigue. The chamber coolant walls in the failed areas exhibit progressive bulging and thinning during cyclic firings until the wall stress finally exceeds the material rupture stress and failure occurs. A preliminary analysis of an oxygen free high conductivity (OFHC) copper cylindrical thrust chamber demonstrated that the inclusion of cumulative cyclic plastic effects enables the observed coolant wall thinout to be predicted. The thinout curve constructed from the referent analysis of 10 firing cycles was extrapolated from the tenth cycle to the 200 th cycle. The preliminary OFHC copper chamber 10 -cycle analysis was extended so that the extrapolated thinout curve could be established by performing cyclic analysis of deformed configurations at 100 and 200 cycles. Thus the original range of extrapolation was reduced and the thinout curve was adjusted by using calculated thinout rates at 100 and 100 cycles. An analysis of the same underformed chamber model constructed of <b>half-hard</b> Amzirc to study the effect of material properties on the thinout curve is included...|$|E
40|$|The high strain-rate damage {{evolution}} and Eracture behavior of <b>half-hard</b> 10 LOO Cu was investigated by experiments and computer simulations. Testing of uniaxial stress and axisymmetric notched {{bars of the}} Hancock-Mackenzie geometries were performetl using a momentum trapped tensile split Hopkinson pressure bar. Specimens were. tested to fracture and to several stages of incipient failure prior to fracture. Recovered specimens were sectioned and metallographically examined using image analysis and optical profilornelry to quantify the resulting damage. The quantified damage is described by spatially resolved porosity distributions, spatially resolved volumetric number densiries, and spatia Ily resolved void size distributions. Concurrent to mechanical testing, explicit finite element simulations of the tensile split Hopkinson pressure bar experiments were perfornicd to quantify the local stress-state and strain-state within the material and to determine the evolution of damage within the notch region. The coinpressive plasticity behavior of the material was fit to the mechanical threshold stress constitutive model, and {{was used in the}} simulations. The quantified damage was coniprued with damage model (TEPLA) predictions and used to refine model parameters and damage nucleation criteria.

40|$|Due to finite {{fossil fuel}} {{resources}} and the impact on our environment of burning fossil fuels, the automotive industry has been investigating {{ways to reduce the}} overall weight of automotive vehicles. This has led to increased interest in ways that light weight alloys such as magnesium can be used in fabrication of automotive parts and manufacturing processes such as welding that would enable increased use of magnesium. The objectives of this project were to characterize and determine the weldability of 2 mm thick AZ 31 B-H 24 magnesium alloy by three different laser beam welding processes: a 4 kW Nuvonyx ISL- 4000 L high power diode laser, a 5 kW Trump TLC- 1005 CO 2 laser, and a 10 kW YLR- 10000 -WC fibre laser. The diode laser operated with a 0. 9 by 12 mm spot size and with a maximum power density of 37 MW/m 2. Due to its low power density, the diode laser was restricted to conduction-mode welding which produced wide fusion zones. The AZ 31 B magnesium laser welds exhibited a number of defects including hydrogen porosity, solidification cracking, liquation cracking, high vaporization rates, molten expulsions, and poor weld bead quality due to low surface tension. It was found that the majority of these defects could be controlled through the proper use of clamping and shielding of the weld pool and joint preparation and surface cleaning prior to welding. The as-received base material was delivered with a dark grey hydrated oxide layer. This surface condition was found to increase the overall diode laser beam absorption but was detrimental to the welding process when disrupted. When incorporated into the weld pool, the oxide created weak facets where solidification cracks would initiate or acted to localize strain during tensile testing. Proper joint preparation was required to produce a high quality diode laser weld: machining of the joint interface to remove interfacial gaps, chemical cleaning with acetone and ethanol to remove residual oils or grease, and stainless steel wire brushing to remove the oxide. Diode laser welds made using 3 kW power and 0. 75 m/min welding speed achieved approximately 60 % of the base metal’s ultimate strength and less than 15 % of the base metal ductility. The reduced strength and ductility were attributed primarily to the weld defects which acted as strain localizers during plastic deformation and the lack of strain hardening in the weld metal. Both the CO 2 and fibre lasers beams had focal spot sizes of 300 μm diameters and maximum power densities of 70 and 140 GW/m 2, respectively. At these power densities, the CO 2 and fibre lasers operated in keyhole-mode and produced welds which had narrower columnated fusion zones. The CO 2 laser keyhole-mode welds exhibited keyhole instability and bulk material loss through vaporization that resulted in macro-porosity, under-fill, and generally poor weld bead quality. Welds produced using 5 kW power and 8 m/min welding speeds achieved approximately 70 % of the base metal’s ultimate strength. The highest quality fibre laser welds were produced at 2 kW power and 100 mm/s welding speeds. These defect-free welds achieved transverse tensile strengths that were 86 % of the base metal’s ultimate strength. The 14 % loss of strength was attributed to the difference in temper of the base metal and the weld metal. The base material was received in a <b>half-hard</b> H 24 temper and the as solidified weld metal is naturally in the softer F temper. This also resulted in a corresponding 15 % reduction in hardness. Failure always occurred in the softened fusion zones of the welded samples where the measured hardness was reduced to an average 60 VHN 25 from the base metal’s 75 HVN 25. The fibre laser weld samples also experienced the greatest extension of any of the tested welds with a cross head displacement of 30 % of the base metal. The extreme reduction in overall cross head displacement was attributed to the lower strength of the fusion zone. This led to strain localization in the transverse tensile specimens and premature failure that occurred prior to plastic deformation of the surrounding base material. Proper joint preparation was found to be critical when laser welding AZ 31 B magnesium sheet. Machined interfaces were required to minimize the gap and degreasing and stainless steel wire brushing were required for removal of the pre-existing hydrated oxide in order to produce sound laser welds. Helium shielding gas was found to improve the weld bead surface quality compared to argon. The keyhole-mode welds produced with the CO 2 and fibre lasers were superior compared to the conduction-mode welds produced with the diode laser. This was due to the narrower fusion zone and reduced bulk material loss. Of the three laser welding processes examined in this study, the fibre laser produced the highest quality, strongest, and most ductile welds when analyzed in transverse tensile testing. However, direct comparisons between the CO 2 and fibre laser welds could not be made because they were made using different joint preparations and welding conditions...|$|E
