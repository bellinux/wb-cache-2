This {{study examines}} {{the factors that}} guide the behaviour and relationships between <b>export</b> <b>producer</b> and intermediary dyads. We examine {{both sides of a}} dyadic transaction and develop an export producer–intermediary behaviour typology by using a grounded theory method through qualitative interviews. We propose three forms of export producer–intermediary dyads based on the degree of information sharing, intensity of price negotiation, level of transaction costs, and partner satisfaction and propensity to export directly. These three forms are as follows: (1) competitive, (2) cooperative and (3) mismatched relationships...|$|R

Combining production, international trade and development theories, a four variable (production, <b>exports,</b> <b>producer</b> price and imports) vector autoregressive moving average (VARMA) model is developed for each country. The causality results show that the hypothesis of export-led development is supported by these three major players in the international wheat trade, though a bi-directional causality is found for Canada and the USA. Variance decomposition and impulse response functions are employed to further investigate the effects of macroeconomic shocks. ...|$|R

Moreover, pass-through of exchange rate to aggregate consumer prices is greater in China and India than Australia. This will have important policy implication for the monetary authorities...|$|R

50|$|According to the {{findings}} of the investigations set by the European Union, Argentine and Indonesian companies benefit from an unfair advantage because of the access they have to raw materials at prices that are low compared to the world market prices available to the EU producers of biodiesel. This is because of the high export taxes that the Argentine and Indonesian government imposes on raw materials used in the biodiesel production. The investigation found that the dumping margin of Argentina was around 41.9% and 49.2%, and for Indonesia between 8.8% and 23.3%. However, by applying the EU “Lesser duty rule”, the anti-dumping duties will be imposed {{at the level of the}} injury margin, for most <b>exporting</b> <b>producers,</b> which is for Argentina between 22% and 25.7%, and for Indonesia between 8.8% and 20.5%.

40|$|Dried, roasted or {{processed}} into peanut butter, peanuts mean {{money for}} millions of households. World peanut production is around 30 million tonnes, with China, USA, Argentina and India as major <b>export</b> <b>producers.</b> In Africa, the largest producers are Nigeria (2, 800, 000 t), Sudan (980, 000 t) and Senegal (828, 000 t). Peanuts are in fact grown in most ACP countries. Research on improved peanut varieties has {{for a long time}} been dormant, but the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), seems to be quickly making up for this (see also Spore 91). For the past decade, research on groundnuts has focused on varieties that are suited for local conditions, such as drought, poor soils and a range of pests and diseases. In Africa, leaf spot, aflatoxine contamination, groundnut rosette and foliar disease often lead to considerable harvest losses. In West Africa, ICRISAT has been releasing numerous disease-resistant varieties for testing among farmers. In Samanko, almost literally the back garden of the ICRISAT centre in Mali, a women s group has been successfully testing some of these varieties. In ideal conditions, a peanut harvest can amount to three tonnes per hectare but traditional varieties in Mali do not yield more than 500 kg/ha. In the tests, some new varieties are yielding more than 1 tonne/ha and are maturing in only 90 days instead of 115 days traditionally. The women determine which varieties pass the test and will be distributed to other regions. They have rejected certain lines of varieties with promising high yields, for one that has more attractive seeds or is more suitable for their goats. It is, ICRISAT tell us, the women who are the major players. That, they say, is what participation is all about. We look forward to the women s side of the story!
