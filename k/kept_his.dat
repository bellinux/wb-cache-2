5|$|Because works {{critical}} of {{the leadership of the}} Chinese regime are considered sensitive, Gui always <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> work projects secret; he <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> movements to himself and his telephone calls were re-routed through foreign countries. He went a long period without entering China; he did not visit his father when the latter was ill, and did not return to China for his father's funeral. Media sources reported that Gui had published about half of the popular books written on Bo Xilai. When Bo was caught in the political fallout from the Wang Lijun incident in 2013, Gui reaped a financial benefit of HK$10million from the surge in book sales. Gui's publishing financed his property acquisitions in Hong Kong and Germany, including a seaside retreat in Pattaya, Thailand.|$|E

5|$|A liberal, Anspach {{feared the}} {{weakness}} and rigidity {{of the government}} and therefore gave the work of covering the river to a private British company, the Belgian Public Works Company (the English name was used), which was created for the task. However, partway through construction, it was forced to relinquish control to the city of Brussels after an embezzlement scandal in which a company director allegedly attempted to steal 2.5 million francs from the company. Anspach only barely <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> office in 1869 by-elections.|$|E
5|$|After VE Day, Ismay {{accompanied}} Churchill to the Potsdam Conference. Like Yalta, {{the conference}} focussed primarily on political issues, {{so there was}} little for Ismay to do. After Clement Attlee defeated Churchill in the 1945 election, becoming Prime Minister, Ismay <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> position, working with Attlee at the conference, but remained loyal to Churchill. Ismay and Churchill remained friends {{for the remainder of}} their lives, and Ismay even helped Churchill write his memoirs, reviewing and commenting on each chapter of his manuscript.|$|E
5|$|After {{attending}} the Far Eastern People's Conference in the Soviet Union, Nosaka returned to Japan in 1922, and {{helped found the}} Japanese Communist Party (JCP) that same year. Nosaka was more secretive {{about his relationship with}} the Communist Party than he had been in Britain, and <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> membership a secret from Bunji Suzuki and other moderate labour leaders. After his return, Nosaka worked as a trade unionist and editor of the JCP's official newspaper, Musansha Shimbun.|$|E

5|$|As president-elect, Taylor <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> {{distance}} from Washington, not resigning his Western Division command until late January 1849. He spent the {{months following the}} election formulating his cabinet selections. He was deliberate and quiet about his decisions, to the frustration of his fellow Whigs. While he despised patronage and political games, he endured a flurry of advances from office-seekers looking {{to play a role}} in his administration.|$|E
5|$|Ball {{struggled}} {{in his first}} season in charge, 1989–90, and his Stoke side were relegated to the third tier of English football after finishing bottom of the Second Division. The start of the 1990–91 season in the Third Division marked the first time Stoke had played at this level in 63 years. Ball <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> job for the start of this campaign but departed in February 1991 {{in the midst of an}} indifferent season that saw Stoke finish in their lowest league position of 14th.|$|E
5|$|During the 2006 election, it {{was brought}} to {{attention}} that Reinfeldt's paternal great-great-grandfather was an African American circus director from New York, John Hood, who had a son with Emma Dorotea Reinfeld, a maid from Eckau in present-day Latvia. Emma Dorotea Reinfeld later married the Swede Anders Karlsson, but her illegitimate son John <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> mother's surname. The spelling was later changed to Reinfeldt.

5|$|Following his {{decision}} not to run for re-election as mayor in 1893, three years later, McCauley sought to be Edmonton's representative in the North-West Territories Legislature. During his term as representative, he worked to upgrade Edmonton's school system, along with upgrading the town's trade industry. He served in this capacity until 1902, when he was defeated. During his time, McCauley <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> focus on his development of the school system, introducing a single tax bill intended to give schools boards power to adopt the tax.|$|E

5|$|Hayes <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> {{pledge not to}} run for re-election, {{retired to}} his home in Ohio, and became an {{advocate}} of social and educational reform. Biographer Ari Hoogenboom said his greatest achievement was to restore popular faith in the presidency and to reverse the deterioration of executive power that had set in after Abraham Lincoln's death. Although supporters have praised his commitment to civil service reform and defense of civil rights, Hayes is generally listed among the high-end of the bottom half in historians' rankings of U.S. presidents.|$|E

5|$|Murray Beck {{writes that}} Macdonald's {{political}} appeal to Nova Scotians {{may have been}} even stronger than the legendary Joseph Howe's.
