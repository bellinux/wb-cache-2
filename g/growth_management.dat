5|$|In 1987, {{the city}} drafted a new master plan, {{also known as}} the <b>Growth</b> <b>Management</b> Guide 2000, which would {{transform}} downtown Flagstaff from a shopping and trade center into a regional center for finance, office use, and government. The city built a new city hall, library, and the Coconino County Administrative Building in the downtown district, staking an investment by the local government for years to come. In 1992, the city hired a new manager, Dave Wilcox, who had previously worked at revitalizing the downtown areas of Beloit, Wisconsin and Missoula, Montana. During the 1990s, the downtown area underwent a revitalization, many of the city sidewalks were repaved with decorative brick facing, and a different mix of shops and restaurants opened up {{to take advantage of the}} area's historical appeal.|$|E

25|$|While {{the member}} {{municipalities}} {{provide for their}} own municipal services, the FVRD acts as the local government for the electoral areas. As a local government or regional district, it can provide services such as water piping, storm sewers, sanitary sewers, street lighting, waste management, fire protection, mosquito control, E911 service, emergency preparedness/recovery, cablevision, air quality monitoring, library funding, <b>growth</b> <b>management,</b> park maintenance, building inspections and bylaw enforcement, planning, and development approvals. Each area does not necessarily receive all these services so each electoral area pays property taxes, through the provincial government, {{in accordance with the}} particular services they receive. The FVRD has opted to implement a regional growth strategy, as allowed by Section 25 of the BC Local Government Act.|$|E
25|$|John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport is {{the busiest}} air cargo hub {{in the country}} and as well the fastest growing airport in Canada. Originally, in the 1940s the airport was used as a wartime air force {{training}} station. Today TradePort International Corporation manages and operates the John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport. Under TradePort management, passenger traffic at the Hamilton terminal has increased from 90,000 in 1996 to approx. 900,000 in 2002, and has grown dramatically since then. The airport's mid-term target for growth in its passenger service is five million air-travelers annually. Air cargo has increased by 50% since 1996; 91,000 metric tonnes (100,000tons) of cargo passed through the airport in 2002. Hamilton's air cargo success is due to its 24-7 operational capability and strategic geographic location. Courier companies with operations at the airport include United Parcel Service and Cargojet Canada. In 2003, the city began developing a 30-year <b>growth</b> <b>management</b> strategy which called, in part, for a massive aerotropolis industrial park centred around Hamilton Airport. The aerotropolis proposal, now known as the Airport Employment Growth District, is touted as a solution to the city's shortage of employment lands. Hamilton turned over operation of the airport to TradePort International Corp. in 1996. In 2007 YVR Airport Services (YVRAS), which runs the Vancouver International Airport, took over 100 per cent ownership of TradePort in a $13-million deal. In 2008 Citigroup Inc., one of the world's largest financial institutions, invested in 50 per cent of YVRAS, the owner of TradePort, which runs Hamilton airport. The airport is also home to the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum.|$|E

2500|$|The {{costs of}} {{uncontrolled}} growth—high municipal debt load, deteriorating public services (including double sessions at {{public schools and}} overtaxed fire and police services), and environmental degradation—triggered a populist revolt against Hamann's growth machine. [...] In the late 1960s, several anti-growth candidates were elected to the City Council. [...] Seeing {{the writing on the}} wall, Hamann retired. [...] In 1971, Norman Mineta—who had been appointed to fill a vacant City Council seat by pro-growth Mayor Ron James but who proved to be an independent—was elected Mayor. [...] During the early 1970s, a feminist-environmentalist electoral alliance consolidated a liberal, anti-growth majority on the City Council. [...] In a final coup against the growth machine, voters elected Janet Gray Hayes as mayor in 1974.

[...] As the name may suggest, <b>growth</b> <b>management</b> may not imply limiting any growth.
