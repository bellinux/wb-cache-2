5|$|The size of {{a market}} assumes primary {{importance}} {{in the study of}} what induces investment in a country. Ragnar Nurkse referenced the work of Allyn A. Young to assert that inducement to <b>invest</b> is limited {{by the size of the}} market. The original idea behind this was put forward by Adam Smith, who stated that division of labour (as against inducement to <b>invest)</b> is limited by the extent of the market.|$|E
5|$|The size of {{the market}} determines the {{incentive}} to <b>invest</b> irrespective {{of the nature of}} the economy. This is because entrepreneurs invariably take their production decisions by taking into consideration the demand for the concerned product. For example, if an automobile manufacturer is trying to decide which countries to set up plants in, he will naturally only <b>invest</b> in those countries where the demand is high. He would prefer to <b>invest</b> in a developed country, where though the population is lesser than in underdeveloped countries, the people are prosperous and there is a definite demand.|$|E

40|$|Factor <b>investing</b> {{has emerged}} as the new {{paradigm}} for long-term investment. Applied to equities, factor <b>investing</b> is probably the most serious contender to the classical industry-based approach to asset allocation. By organizing a multi-trial contest opposing factor <b>investing</b> and sector <b>investing,</b> we address two questions: 1) Are the excess returns of factor <b>investing</b> offset by higher risks, and if so, are factor-specific risks eliminable by means of factor diversification? 2) How does factor <b>investing</b> perform during crisis times? Our results suggest that this form of <b>investing</b> is the best strategy when short sales are permitted. It also outperforms industry-based allocation during expansion and bull periods. In contrast, sector <b>investing</b> offers defensive opportunities to asset managers since it delivers better risk-return trade-offs for long-only portfolios during recessions and bear periods. Overall, factor <b>investing</b> keeps its promises, but it {{still has a long way}} to go before it can oust sector <b>investing.</b> info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|The terms socially-responsible <b>investing</b> (SRI), mission-related <b>investing,</b> impact <b>investing</b> and environmental, {{social and}} {{governance}} (ESG) <b>investing</b> [...] all frequently grouped {{under the heading}} of responsible <b>investing</b> [...] have become a familiar part of the vocabulary of institutional and retail investors. Just what these terms mean in practice, however, and how their practitioners' claims can be impartially assessed, has been less clear. Responsible <b>investing</b> can be broken into three main categories: Socially-responsible <b>investing</b> (SRI) A portfolio construction process that attempts to avoid investments in certain stocks or industries through negative screening according to defined ethical guidelines. Impact <b>investing</b> <b>Investing</b> in projects, companies, fund or organizations with the express goal of generating and measuring effecting mission-related social, environmental or economic change alongside financial returns. Environmental, social and governance (ESG) <b>investing</b> Integrating the three ESG factors into fundamental investment analysis {{to the extent that they}} are material to investment performance. While these terms may all be gathered under the term responsible <b>investing,</b> these approaches serve very different purposes. SRI and impact <b>investing</b> use funding and investment activities to express institutional values or advance the institution's mission. In contrast, ESG <b>investing</b> aims to improve investment performance, thereby making additional resources available for mission support. For a long time, SRI was by far the most widely-used of the three approaches. In recent years, however, it has been argued that, although negative screening can be a useful tool for institutions desiring to express ethical, religious or moral values through their investment portfolio, for many it may prove too restrictive. ESG analysis, on the other hand, takes a broader view, examining whether environmental, social and governance issues may be material to a company's performance, and therefore to the investment performance of a long-term portfolio. Thus, while not every institution will choose to engage in SRI or impact <b>investing,</b> fiduciaries of long-term institutional investors should seek to develop a well-reasoned view on their institution's approach to ES...|$|R
