50|$|There is {{abundant}} marine life surrounding this island due to underwater topography and ocean currents. Virtually all local marine life must migrate past {{the island and}} water visibility goes up to 30 meters making it a prime location for big game fishing. There are abundant <b>golden</b> <b>grouper,</b> marlin, sailfish, swordfish or broadbill, and other game fish in Cerralvo Canal waters. Views from island at dawn and sunset are very lively and filled with color.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. One {{specimen}} (300 mm {{in standard}} length) of Saloptia powelli, {{belonging to the}} family Serranidae, was newly collected in a local fish market in Manado, North Sulawesi, constituting a new record for the species in the Indonesian archipelago. This species was diagnosed by the following morphological traits: dorsal rays VII, 11, anal rays III, 8, well-defined opercular spines, pelvic fins below pectoral fins, caudal fin emarginate, mouth moderate in size, supplemental maxillary present, fine teeth in irregular rows on vomer and palatines. Head, body, and fins yellow in color. We suggest ???Kerapu emas???, a translation of its existing common name ???<b>golden</b> <b>grouper???,</b> for the Indonesian species names. Keywords: New record, Saloptia powelli, Serranidae, North Sulawesi, Indonesia...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Betanodaviruses are the causative {{agents of}} Viral Encephalopathy and Retinopathy (VER). To date, more than 50 species {{have proved to}} be {{susceptible}} and among them, those found in genus Epinephelus are highly represented. Clinical disease outbreaks are generally characterized by typical nervous signs and significant mortalities mainly associated with aquaculture activities, although some concerns for the impact of this infection in wild fish have been raised. In this study, the authors present the first documented report describing an outbreak of VER in wild species in the Mediterranean basin. Case presentation In late summer - early winter 2011 (September-December), significant mortalities affecting wild Dusky grouper (Epinephelus marginatus), <b>Golden</b> <b>grouper</b> (Epinephelus costae) and European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) were reported in the municipality of Santa Maria di Leuca (Northern Ionian Sea, Italy). The affected fish showed an abnormal swimming behavior and swollen abdomens. During this epizootic, five moribund fish showing clear neurological signs were captured and underwent laboratory investigations. Analytical results confirmed the diagnosis of VER in all the specimens. Genetic characterization classified all betanodavirus isolates as belonging to the RGNNV genotype, revealing a close genetic relationship with viral sequences obtained from diseased farmed fish reared in the same area in previous years. Conclusion The close relationship of the viral sequences between the isolates collected in wild affected fish and those isolated during clinical disease outbreaks in farmed fish in the same area in previous years suggests a persistent circulation of betanodaviruses and transmission between wild and farmed stocks. Further investigations are necessary to assess the risk of viral transmission between wild and farmed fish populations, particularly in marine protected areas where endangered species are present. </p...|$|E
5000|$|The Warm Ocean: This section {{contains}} the largest aquarium in Blue Planet, the 4000000 L Ocean tank. It {{is home to}} sharks (zebra shark, blacktip reef shark, wobbegongs and young scalloped hammerheads), stingrays, eagle rays, guitarfish, moray eels, <b>golden</b> trevallies, <b>groupers</b> and more {{that can be seen}} through the 16 by 8 m main window, which is 45 cm thick. There is also a 16 m long shark tunnel. Opposite the Ocean Tank is the 16 m long coral reef with living corals and reef fish. There are also various smaller aquaria with species such as shrimpfish, weedy seadragon, seahorses, a Mediterranean aquarium, and the highly venomous stonefish, lionfish and olive sea snake.|$|R
