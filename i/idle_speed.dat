25|$|It {{was decided}} to design a new diesel engine family that could be {{produced}} in various capacities and states of tune suitable for all of Rover's needs. The development was codenamed Project Storm and design responsibility was given to Land Rover who were to build the engines. The result was a range of engines using the L-Series as a base—the bore/stroke dimensions were the same and the Storm engine used the same piston and connecting rod assemblies. The Storm utilised Electronic Unit Injection by Lucas (at the time this technology was rare on small-capacity engine, being used only on large commercial vehicles) and a cross-flow aluminium alloy cylinder head on a cast-iron block. The designers had aimed at increasing servicing intervals so the engine incorporated both conventional and centrifugal oil filters. The electronic systems included an 'anti-stall' system to allow heavy loads to be started from rest at <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> and two programmed operating modes for road and off-road use. The overhead camshaft (operating both valves and the unit injectors) was chain-driven. The Storm design encompassed 4-, 5- and 6-cylinder engines (of 2, 2.5 and 3 litres respectively).|$|E

Power increases to , although torque is reduced to [...] Along with the 3.0-litre engine, a 3.6-litre version of the same, producing [...] and , was also unveiled. Other than the manual transmission version of the SV6, all SIDI V6 models are coupled to GM's 6L50 automatic and fall under Holden's EcoLine banner. Benefits to fuel economy for the 3.6-litre SIDI can also be attributed to an improved [...] "deceleration fuel cut" [...] system, which terminates the fuel supply during engine coasting; a higher efficiency alternator and voltage regulator; a 50rpm lower <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> (to 550rpm); and a new [...] "turbine damper" [...] for the automatic transmission that works to suppress vibrations at low rpms, thus enabling earlier upshifts.

2500|$|The Series II Land Rover was a sales success, {{but there}} was still room for improvements. In 1962 the {{slightly}} altered Series IIA was launched. As well as some suspension and steering system changes, the biggest update was an improved diesel engine. This shared many parts with its petrol-fuelled sibling, including the block, valve gear, cooling systems and lubrication systems. A forged crankshaft was used for added strength, and different pistons were needed. The cylinder head used the same basic casting, but was very different internally, being in essence an updated version of that used on the original 2-litre engine, to which the new diesel bore a strong external resemblance. Like the 2.25-litre petrol, the 2.25-litre diesel was a dry-liner design. It was built on the same production line as the petrol engine and the flexibility of the basic design was much in evidence- for example, where the diesel engines had their fuel injector pumps, the petrol engine had its distributor fitted. Although it offered a modest improvement in power and a useful jump in torque, the main benefit of the new diesel engine was that it was much quieter and more efficient than the older unit. It also proved to be much more reliable in service. Like the petrol engine, the diesel was upgraded to a 5-bearing crankshaft in 1980. The engine was fitted to the Austin FX4 Black Cab between 1982 and 1985. FX4s fitted with the engine were designated 'FX4R' ('R' for 'Rover'). In this application the engine gained a reputation for very short service life and unreliability. This was caused by the significantly greater times spent at <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> in the Black Cab than in the Land Rover. Solihull engineers had warned Carbodies, builders of the FX4R that this would cause problems as at <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> the engine's oil pressure dropped, causing the automatic tensioner unit for the timing chain to not operate fully. At the high number of hours spent at <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> (taxi drivers tended to leave the engines idling for long period whilst waiting for passengers or when off-duty as well as all the time spent in stationary traffic in London) this caused the timing chains to stretch, causing incorrect fuel injection timing which greatly reduced engine life. [...] The 10J engine was also adapted into a marine engine by Mercury of the USA and sold under the Mercruiser 165 name.|$|E

Gains in efficiency have been achieved via the implementation of direct fuel injection, improvements to the fuel cutout during coasting, {{the addition of a}} more efficient alternator and voltage regulator, a 50rpm lower <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> (to 550rpm), and a new [...] "turbine damper" [...] for the automatic transmission that works to suppress vibrations at low rpm, thus enabling earlier upshifts.

40|$|Control of {{performance}} and transient emissions from turbocharged diesel engines is an important objective for automotive manufacturers, since stringent criteria for exhaust emissions must be met. In particular, (cold) starting is of exceptional importance owing to its {{significant contribution to the}} overall emissions during a transient test cycle. In the present work, experimental tests were conducted on a turbocharged and after-cooled bus-truck diesel engine in order to investigate the engine operating behaviour and the formation mechanisms of nitric oxide, smoke, and combustion noise during cold, warm, and hot starting. With this as a target, a fully instrumented test bed was set up, using ultra-fast response analysers capable of capturing the instantaneous development of emissions and various key engine and turbocharger parameters. The experimental test pattern included a variety of starting conditions, defined by the thermal status of the engine (i. e. the coolant temperature) and its <b>idling</b> <b>speed.</b> As expected, turbocharger lag was found to be the major contributor for the pollutant emissions spikes in all cases, with the thermal status of the engine and its <b>idling</b> <b>speed</b> playing important roles in the combustion (in) stability, turbocharger response, and noise radiation...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} cab comfort truck drivers have to idle their engine to obtain the required power for accessories, such as the air conditioner, heater, television, refrigerator, and lights. This idling of the engine has {{a major impact on}} its fuel consumption and exhaust emission. Idling emissions can be as high as 86. 4 g/h, 16, 500 g/h, 5130 g/h, 4 g/h, and 375 g/h for HC, CO 2, CO, PM, and NOx, respectively. Idling fuel consumption rate can be as high as 1. 85 gal/h. The accessory loading, truck model, fuel-injection system, ambient temperature, <b>idling</b> <b>speed,</b> etc., also affect significantly the emission levels and fuel consumption rate. An increase in accessory loading and ambient temperature increases the emissions and fuel consumption. During idling, electronic fuel-injection systems reduce HC, PM, and CO emission, but increase NOx emissions compared with a mechanical fuel-injection system. An increase of <b>idling</b> <b>speed</b> increases fuel consumption rate. There are many systems available on the market to reduce engine idling and improve air quality and fuel consumption rate, such as an auxiliary power unit (APU), truck stop electrification, thermal storage systems, fuel cells, and direct fire heaters. A direct fire heater reduces fuel consumption by 94 - 96 % and an APU reduces consumption by 60 - 87 %. Furthermore, these technologies increase air quality significantly by reducing idling emissions, which is the reason why they are considered as key alternatives to engine idling.
