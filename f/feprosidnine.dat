50|$|<b>Feprosidnine</b> (Sydnophen) is a {{stimulant}} drug {{which was}} developed in the USSR in the 1970s. It is structurally related to another Russian drug mesocarb but unlike Mesocarb, was withdrawn earlier from production. In comparison with Mesocarb it has own antidepressant activity, which makes it useful in treating depressions. Indications of <b>Feprosidnine</b> included apathic, asthenic depressions, fatique, apathic syndrome, narcolepsy and other similar conditions. Therapeutic range of doses: 10-50mg a day.Sydnophen has multiple mechanisms of action, the relative importance of which has not been clearly established. Effects on the body include reversible monoamine oxidase inhibition, cholinergic, adrenergic, opioid and nitric oxide donating actions, all of which may contribute to its pharmacological effects to some extent.|$|E
5000|$|Sydnone is a mesoionic heterocyclic {{aromatic}} chemical compound. Recent computational studies have, however, shown sydnone {{and other}} similar mesoionic compounds to be nonaromatic, [...] "though well-stabilized in two separate regions by electron and charge delocalization." [...] A sydnone imine in which the keto group of sydnone (=O) has been replaced with an imino (=NH) group can be found as a substructure in the stimulant drugs <b>feprosidnine</b> and mesocarb.|$|E
