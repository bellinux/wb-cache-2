5|$|British {{officials}} filed two lawsuits {{stemming from}} the Liberty incident: an in rem suit against the ship, and an in personam suit against Hancock. Royal officials, as well as Hancock's accuser, stood to gain financially, since, as was the custom, any penalties assessed by the court would be awarded to the governor, the informer, and the Crown, each getting a third. The first suit, <b>filed</b> <b>on</b> June 22, 1768, resulted in the confiscation of the Liberty in August. Customs officials then used the ship to enforce trade regulations until it was burned by angry colonists in Rhode Island the following year.|$|E

50|$|In 1981, while {{conducting}} research {{for a book}} about John Lennon, Wiener learned of the F.B.I. surveillance, {{and that there were}} either 281 or 400 pages of <b>files</b> <b>on</b> the ex-Beatle. Wiener requested the release of the FBI's <b>files</b> <b>on</b> Lennon by citing the Freedom of Information Act. The FBI refused to release two-thirds or 199 pages of the <b>files</b> <b>on</b> the grounds that they contained “national security” information. The pages that were released were heavily blacked out with magic marker, or redacted.|$|R
5|$|By 1924, the {{newspaper}} {{had a good}} circulation but was losing money because of low advertising revenues. Vanderbilt sought help from his parents, and they agreed to help if most authority went to their hand-picked manager, Harvey Johnson. His father poured {{over a million dollars}} into {{the newspaper}} in 1924–1925, but Johnson's involvement led to a rightward shift in the newspaper, which alienated many readers. In April 1926, Johnson concluded that the Illustrated Daily News and the two other newspapers that Vanderbilt had founded in other cities could survive if $300,000 more were invested in them; however, the elder Vanderbilt refused to provide any more money. A petition for receivership was <b>filed</b> <b>on</b> May 3, 1926.|$|E
5|$|Controversy emerged over Entrance 2's {{location}} in February 2011, when a lawsuit was {{filed by the}} Yorkshire Towers over the location of Entrance 2. The entrances, planned to service 3,600 people an hour, were alleged in the lawsuit to be destroying {{the quality of life}} for building tenants, if the entrances were to be built in the location. The lawsuit was later dismissed because the suit had been filed two years after the FTA's FONSI was published, which was past the statute of limitations. A new lawsuit was <b>filed</b> <b>on</b> March 15, 2013, after the MTA started construction on the entrances. In June 2013, that lawsuit was also dismissed.|$|E
5|$|For {{a case to}} be investigated, {{a person}} needs to {{petition}} the CCDI.

Petitions may also be <b>filed</b> <b>on</b> the CCDI website, and the commission receives cases through the Office for Circuit Inspection Work (which sends inspection teams throughout the country). In a case handled by former ODIS Third Division director and Case Hearing Office director Li Huiran, a petition was sent to all department heads in the ministry employing the petitioner, several offices of the CCDI and PSC members Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Zhu Rongji and Wei Jianxing.|$|E

It said that reports were not <b>filed</b> <b>on</b> many other victims because of {{the passage of time}} and other factors. Of the certified victims, 41 percent were children under 15, and 70 percent were women, children or men over age 61.|$|E
5|$|In his {{cross-examination}} {{of the two}} doctors, Duchesne {{cited the}} psychological reports <b>filed</b> <b>on</b> Lamb at Penetanguishene in 1966, which had determined Lamb to have an IQ of 125, far above most of his 18-year-old peers. The prosecutor proposed {{that it was not}} beyond Lamb, with his psychopathic personality and high level of intelligence, to invent a story of amnesia and confusion to avoid responsibility for satisfying his dangerous impulses by consciously killing people. Both Yaworsky and Dolan said that although this was possible, they were each sticking to their original conclusions made in the days following the incident.|$|E
5|$|On January 12, 2011 Itzhak and Meir Abergil {{and three}} {{associates}} were extradited to the United States. In a 77-page 32-count indictment <b>filed</b> <b>on</b> July 13, 2008 at {{federal court in}} Los Angeles, the Abergil family {{is considered one of}} the most powerful crime families in Israel, deriving that power, in part, “because of its propensity for violence in Israel and around the world.” They were charged with murder, laundering millions of dollars obtained from embezzlement at Israel Trade Bank, extortion of business people, and operating an ecstasy-distribution network for millions of ecstasy pills. The Abergils and their three associates have denied all charges. According to Israeli police sources, their crime organization has continued to operate in Israel after their extradition.|$|E

5|$|Rumors {{of a new}} {{roller coaster}} being built at Six Flags Magic Mountain first emerged {{in the summer of}} 2004. Land {{clearing}} began in mid-2005 around the Samurai Summit area of the park with track for the new roller coaster soon later beginning arriving from Ohio. Construction permits filed by Six Flags Magic Mountain and a trademark for the name Tatsu (<b>filed</b> <b>on</b> August 23, 2005) were later found by the public. Tatsu was officially announced to the public on November 17, 2005. Both Revolution and Roaring Rapids were temporarily closed in order for the roller coaster to be built. After construction and testing was complete, Tatsu opened to the public on May 13, 2006.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, {{the company}} {{publicly}} introduced a greatly improved system of electronic audio, including sensitive condenser microphones and rubber-line recorders (named after {{the use of}} a rubber damping band for recording with better frequency response onto a wax master disc). That May, the company licensed entrepreneur Walter J. Rich to exploit the system for commercial motion pictures; he founded Vitagraph, in which Warner Bros. acquired a half interest, just one month later. In April 1926, Warners signed a contract with AT for exclusive use of its film sound technology for the redubbed Vitaphone operation, leading to the production of Don Juan and its accompanying shorts over the following months. During the period when Vitaphone had exclusive access to the patents, the fidelity of recordings made for Warners films was markedly superior to those made for the company's sound-on-film competitors. Meanwhile, Bell Labs—the new name for the AT research operation—was working at a furious pace on sophisticated sound amplification technology that would allow recordings to be played back over loudspeakers at theater-filling volume. The new moving-coil speaker system was installed in New York's Warners Theatre at the end of July and its patent submission, for what Western Electric called the No. 555 Receiver, was <b>filed</b> <b>on</b> August 4, just two days before the premiere of Don Juan.|$|E
5|$|In May 1985, {{designers}} {{started work}} on the F1 project. In late 1985, designers presented the first exterior study models to F1 management, featuring a sports car-like design with a low-slung hood and narrow front profile. By 1986, the sedan used a three-box design with an upright stance, more prominent grille, and a two-tone body. Extensive modeling and wind tunnel tests resulted in a low drag coefficient for a conventional production vehicle of the time (C'd 0.29). For the passenger cabin, the materials-selection tests evaluated 24 different kinds of wood and multiple types of leather {{for two years before}} settling on specific trim combinations. By 1986, the Lexus marque was created to support the launch of the flagship sedan, and the vehicle became known as the Lexus LS. Following eight design reviews, subsequent revisions, concept approval in September 1986, and over US$1 billion in development expenses, the final design for the production Lexus LS 400 (chassis code UCF10) was frozen in May 1987 with design patents <b>filed</b> <b>on</b> 13 May 1987.|$|E

5|$|On December 29, 2014, Bank Markazi filed a {{petition}} for certiorari with the Supreme Court of the United States, requesting the Court {{to consider the}} question: Does §8772 violate {{the separation of powers}} by purporting to change the law for, and directing a particular result in, a single pending case? The certiorari petition was circulated to the Justices for their conference on April 3, 2015, after a brief by the respondents (Peterson) opposing certiorari and a reply brief from the petitioner (Bank Markazi) were filed in March. Following the April 3rd conference, the Court called for the Solicitor General to file a brief expressing the views of the federal government, which was <b>filed</b> <b>on</b> August 19. In May and June, the Supreme Court meets only to issue orders and opinions and does not hear oral arguments until the next term begins. The Court granted certiorari following its conference on September 28.|$|E
5|$|On July 2, 2010 Minister of Environmental Protection Viktor Boiko (Bloc Lytvyn) was {{replaced}} by Mykola Zlochevskiy and Vice Prime Minister Volodymyr Seminozhenko was fired by the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian parliament) the same day. A draft resolution proposing the dismissal of Semynozhenko was submitted by lawmaker Olha Bodnar of Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko. On July 10, 2010 Minister of Extraordinary Situations Nestor Shufrych was dismissed by Verkhovna Rada. For his dismissal voted 256 deputies. However Viktor Yanukovych found a new assignment for Shufrych and appointed him as the assistant {{to the secretary of}} the Council for National Security. Shufrych's duties were temporary assigned to Volodymyr Antonets till Mikhail Bolotskikh was appointed acting minister on July 23, 2010. Soon after the motion to overturn the 2004 Constitutional amendments was <b>filed</b> <b>on</b> July 14 by the representatives of the Azarov Government, Vasyl Tsushko, previously as an unaffiliated member of the government, was elected the leader of the Socialist Party of Ukraine (extra parliamentarian party, non-coalition) on July 24, 2010.|$|E
5|$|Preckwinkle {{chairs the}} ward organization, the Fourth Ward Democratic Organization, {{which was one}} of sixteen Chicago Democratic ward {{organizations}} named in a complaint <b>filed</b> <b>on</b> August 31, 2005 with the Illinois State Board of Elections by the Cook County Republican Party charging that Democratic Party ward organizations are illegally housed in City-funded neighborhood ward offices. Taxpayers fund aldermanic service centers, which are open to the public. State law prohibits the use of public funds by any candidate for political or campaign purposes. The complaint against Preckwinkle's ward organization was one of nine that a Hearing Officer appointed by the Board recommended proceed to the next step of the hearing process, an Open Preliminary Hearing. On October 17, 2005, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Elections, the Board entered an executive session and voted, in a 4–4 tie, along strict party lines, failing to adopt the recommendation of the Hearing Officer, and ordered the complaints dismissed. The complaint against Preckwinkle's ward organization was one of eight that the Cook County Republican Party appealed {{all the way to the}} Supreme Court of Illinois. On January 23, 2009, the Illinois Supreme Court unanimously ordered the Illinois appellate court to conduct a judicial review of the Board's dismissals of the complaints.|$|E
