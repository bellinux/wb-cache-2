Beta defensins, a family of antimicrobial peptides found in the respiratory tract, are responsible for further inflammation in DPB when a pathogen such as P.aeruginosa is present. If present with DPB, the human T-lymphotropic virus, type I, a retrovirus, modifies DPB pathogenesis by infecting T <b>helper</b> <b>cells</b> and altering their effectiveness in recognizing the presence of known or unknown pathogens involved with DPB.|$|E

5|$|<b>Helper</b> T <b>cells</b> express T {{cell receptors}} (TCR) that {{recognize}} antigen bound to Class II MHC molecules. The MHC:antigen complex is also {{recognized by the}} <b>helper</b> <b>cell's</b> CD4 co-receptor, which recruits molecules inside the T cell (e.g., Lck) {{that are responsible for}} the T <b>cell's</b> activation. <b>Helper</b> T <b>cells</b> have a weaker association with the MHC:antigen complex than observed for killer T cells, meaning many receptors (around 200–300) on the <b>helper</b> T <b>cell</b> must be bound by an MHC:antigen in order to activate the <b>helper</b> <b>cell,</b> while killer T cells can be activated by engagement of a single MHC:antigen molecule. <b>Helper</b> T <b>cell</b> activation also requires longer duration of engagement with an antigen-presenting cell. The activation of a resting <b>helper</b> T <b>cell</b> causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types. Cytokine signals produced by <b>helper</b> T <b>cells</b> enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of killer T <b>cells.</b> In addition, <b>helper</b> T <b>cell</b> activation causes an upregulation of molecules expressed on the T cell's surface, such as CD40 ligand (also called CD154), which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required to activate antibody-producing B cells.|$|R

25|$|Upon {{release of}} nuclear {{proteins}} and chromatin, antigen presenting cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, display these antigens to T <b>helper</b> <b>cells.</b> Although {{the details of}} this process are still controversial, evidence shows that to produce an immune response, DNA must activate an antigen presenting cell to produce type 1 interferons. This cytokine serves to induce maturation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) so that they can display their antigens to T <b>helper</b> <b>cells.</b> The mechanism in which eukaryotic DNA activates these cells is still as yet unclear; however, immunogenic CpG sequences have been found to either activate PDCs or act as adjuvant in the response to eukaryotic DNA. CpG motif DNA acts via the pattern recognition receptor, toll-like receptor 9, found highly expressed in PDCs and B cells. The T <b>helper</b> <b>cells</b> then activate B cells, which are also in the presence of these antigens, causing the production of autoantibodies.|$|E
25|$|Interferon type II (IFN-γ in humans): This is {{also known}} as immune {{interferon}} and is activated by Interleukin-12. Furthermore, type II interferons are released by T <b>helper</b> <b>cells,</b> type 1 specifically. However, they block the proliferation of T <b>helper</b> <b>cells</b> type two. The previous results in an inhibition of Th2 immune response and a further induction of Th1 immune response, which leads to the development of debilitating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. IFN type II binds to IFNGR, which consists of IFNGR1 and IFNGR2 chains and has a different receptor than type I IFN.|$|E
25|$|The ovaries {{are made}} up of a number of egg tubes, called ovarioles, which vary in size and number by species. The number of eggs that the insect is able to make vary by the number of ovarioles with the rate that eggs can be {{developed}} being also influenced by ovariole design. In meroistic ovaries, the eggs-to-be divide repeatedly and most of the daughter cells become <b>helper</b> <b>cells</b> for a single oocyte in the cluster. In panoistic ovaries, each egg-to-be produced by stem germ cells develops into an oocyte; there are no <b>helper</b> <b>cells</b> from the germ line. Production of eggs by panoistic ovaries tends to be slower than that by meroistic ovaries.|$|E

25|$|The {{relevance}} of CD4+ T <b>helper</b> <b>cells</b> is highlighted during an HIV infection.

40|$|Fungal {{infections are}} an {{emerging}} threat for human health. A coordinated host immune response is fundamental for successful elimination of an invading fungal microbe. A panel of C-type lectin receptors expressed on antigen-presenting dendritic cells enable innate recognition of fungal cell wall carbohydrates and tailors adaptive responses via {{the instruction of}} CD 4 ⁺ T <b>helper</b> <b>cell</b> fates. Well-balanced T <b>helper</b> <b>cell</b> type 1 and IL- 17 -producing T <b>helper</b> <b>cell</b> responses are crucial in antifungal immunity and facilitate phagocytic clearance of fungal encounters.

In this review, we outline the key roles of several C-type lectin receptors during the generation of protective antifungal immunity, with particular emphasis on the distinct signaling pathways and transcriptional programs triggered by these receptors, which collaborate to orchestrate polarization of the T helper respons...|$|R

25|$|The Th2 {{response}} {{is characterized by}} the release of Interleukin 5, which induces eosinophils in the clearance of parasites. Th2 also produce Interleukin 4, which facilitates B cell isotype switching. In general, Th2 responses are more effective against extracellular bacteria, parasites including helminths and toxins. Like cytotoxic T cells, most of the CD4+ <b>helper</b> <b>cells</b> die on resolution of infection, with a few remaining as CD4+ memory cells.|$|E
25|$|The T <b>helper</b> <b>cells</b> (Th cells) are {{a type of}} T {{cell that}} play an {{important}} role in the immune system, particularly in the adaptive immune system. They help the activity of other immune cells by releasing T cell cytokines. These cells help suppress or regulate immune responses. They are essential in B cell antibody class switching, in the activation and growth of cytotoxic T cells, and in maximizing bactericidal activity of phagocytes such as macrophages.|$|E
25|$|There are {{hypersensitivity}} responses, both a type I response (atopic, with {{formation of}} immunoglobulin E, or IgE) and a type III hypersensitivity response (with formation of immunoglobulin G, or IgG). The reaction of IgE with Aspergillus antigens results in mast cell degranulation with bronchoconstriction and increased capillary permeability. Immune complexes (a type III reaction) and inflammatory cells are deposited within the mucous membranes of the airways, leading to necrosis (tissue death) and eosinophilic infiltration. Type 2 T <b>helper</b> <b>cells</b> appear {{to play an}} important role in ABPA due to an increased sensitivity to interleukin (IL) 4 and IL-5.

25|$|THαβ <b>helper</b> <b>cells</b> {{provide the}} host {{immunity}} against viruses. Their differentiation is triggered by IFN α/β or IL-10. Their key effector cytokine is IL-10. Their main effector cells are NK cells {{as well as}} CD8 T cells, IgG B cells, and IL-10 CD4 T cells. The key THαβ transcription factors are STAT1 and STAT3 as well as IRFs. IL-10 from CD4 T cells activate NK cells' ADCC to apoptose virus-infected cells and to induce host as well as viral DNA fragmentation. IFN alpha/beta can suppress transcription to avoid virus replication and transmission. Overactivation of THαβ against autoantigen will cause type 2 antibody-dependent cytotoxic hypersensitivity. Myasthenia gravis or Graves' disease belong to this category.|$|E
25|$|Th1 <b>helper</b> <b>cells</b> are {{the host}} {{immunity}} effectors against intracellular bacteria and protozoa. They are triggered by IL-12, IL-2 and their effector cytokine is IFN-γ. The main effector cells of Th1 immunity are macrophages {{as well as}} CD8 T cells, IgG B cells, and IFN-γ CD4 T cells. The key Th1 transcription factors are STAT4 and T-bet. IFN-γ secreted by CD4 T cells can activate macrophages to phagocytose and digest intracellular bacteria and protozoa. In addition, IFN-γ can activate iNOS to produce NOx free radicals to directly kill intracellular bacteria and protozoa. Th1 overactivation against autoantigens will cause Type 4 delayed-type hypersensitivity. Tuberculin reaction or Type 1 diabetes belong to this category of autoimmunity.|$|E
25|$|The cell-mediated {{response}} to the virus and to vectors is poorly characterised, and has been largely ignored in the literature as recently as 2005. Clinical trials using an AAV2-based vector to treat haemophilia B {{seem to indicate that}} targeted destruction of transduced cells may be occurring. Combined with data that shows that CD8+ T-cells can recognise elements of the AAV capsid in vitro, it appears {{that there may be a}} cytotoxic T lymphocyte {{response to}} AAV vectors. Cytotoxic responses would imply the involvement of CD4+ T <b>helper</b> <b>cells</b> in the response to AAV and in vitro data from human studies suggests that the virus may indeed induce such responses, including both Th1 and Th2 memory responses. A number of candidate T cell stimulating epitopes have been identified within the AAV capsid protein VP1, which may be attractive targets for modification of the capsid if the virus is to be used as a vector for gene therapy.|$|E

25|$|A {{predisposing factor}} to {{developing}} DIL is N-acetylation speed, or {{the rate at}} which the body can metabolize the drug. This is greatly decreased in patients with a genetic deficiency of the enzyme N-acetyltransferase. A study showed that 29 of 30 patients with DIL were slow acetylators. In addition, these patients had more hydralazine metabolites in their urine than fast acetylators. These metabolites (byproducts of the interactions between the drug and constituents in the body) of hydralazine are said to have been created when white blood cells have been activated, meaning they are stimulated to produce a respiratory burst. Respiratory burst in white blood cells induces an increased production of free radicals and oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide. These oxidants have been found to react with hydralazine to produce a reactive species that is able to bond to protein. Monocytes, one type of white blood cell, detect the antigen and relay the recognition to T <b>helper</b> <b>cells,</b> creating antinuclear antibodies leading to an immune response. Further studies on the interactions between oxidants and hydralazine are necessary to understand the processes involved in DIL.|$|E
25|$|Abnormalities in the {{maternal}} {{immune system and}} insufficiency of gestational immune tolerance seem to play major roles in pre-eclampsia. One of the main differences found in pre-eclampsia is a shift toward Th1 responses {{and the production of}} IFN-γ. The origin of IFN-γ is not clearly identified and could be the natural killer cells of the uterus, the placental dendritic cells modulating responses of T <b>helper</b> <b>cells,</b> alterations in synthesis of or response to regulatory molecules, or changes in the function of regulatory T cells in pregnancy. Aberrant immune responses promoting pre-eclampsia may also be due to an altered fetal allorecognition or to inflammatory triggers. It has been documented that fetal cells such as fetal erythroblasts as well as cell-free fetal DNA are increased in {{the maternal}} circulation in women who develop pre-eclampsia. These findings have given rise to the hypothesis that pre-eclampsia is a disease process by which a placental lesion such as hypoxia allows increased fetal material into the maternal circulation, that in turn leads to an immune response and endothelial damage, and that ultimately results in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.|$|E
25|$|T cells (thymus cells) and B cells (bone marrow- or bursa-derived cells) are {{the major}} {{cellular}} components of the adaptive immune response. T cells are involved in cell-mediated immunity, whereas B cells are primarily responsible for humoral immunity (relating to antibodies). The function of T cells and B cells is to recognize specific “non-self” antigens, during {{a process known as}} antigen presentation. Once they have identified an invader, the cells generate specific responses that are tailored to maximally eliminate specific pathogens or pathogen-infected cells. B cells respond to pathogens by producing large quantities of antibodies which then neutralize foreign objects like bacteria and viruses. In response to pathogens some T cells, called T <b>helper</b> <b>cells,</b> produce cytokines that direct the immune response, while other T cells, called cytotoxic T cells, produce toxic granules that contain powerful enzymes which induce the death of pathogen-infected cells. Following activation, B cells and T cells leave a lasting legacy of the antigens they have encountered, in the form of memory cells. Throughout the lifetime of an animal, these memory cells will remember each specific pathogen encountered, and are able to mount a strong and rapid response if the same pathogen is detected again; this is known as acquired immunity.|$|E
