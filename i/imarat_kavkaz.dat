2500|$|On 7 October 2007, Umarov {{proclaimed the}} <b>Imarat</b> <b>Kavkaz</b> (Caucasus Emirate, aimed at uniting Northern Caucasus {{into a single}} Islamic state) and at once {{declared}} himself its Emir, thereby converting the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria into a vilayat (province) of the new emirate, which would encompass several other republics of Russian Federation. The move to establish the Emirate was quickly condemned by Akhmed Zakayev, by then until recently Umarov's own minister of foreign affairs. Zakayev, living in exile in London, called upon all separatist fighters and politicians to pledge allegiance directly to the Chechen parliament {{in an attempt to}} isolate his former subordinate from power. Zakayev expressed regret that Umarov had caved to pressure from [...] "provocateurs" [...] and committed a [...] "crime" [...] that undermines the legitimacy of the ChRI. In a one-day period two former senior field commanders, Isa Munayev and Sultan Arsayev, issued statements publicly siding with Zakayev and distancing themselves from Umarov. However, all of the prominent active field commanders in Chechnya, with the sole exception of Amir Mansur (Arbi Evmirzayev, the leader of the Islamic Jamaat of Chechnya who was killed in 2010) and some small-time commanders (such as Amir Khamza of the Islamic Brigade of Chechnya and Amir Surkho of the Staraya Sunzha Sabotage Group), had sided with Dokka Umarov on the decision.|$|E
