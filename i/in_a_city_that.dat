5|$|Lisa's Florentine {{family was}} old and aristocratic but over time had lost their influence. They were well off but not wealthy, and lived on farm income <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>that</b> was among the largest in Europe. While {{economically}} successful, there were great disparities in wealth among its inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|In The Artist Among the Missing (1949), Manning {{illustrates}} the racial tensions that are created when imperialism and multiculturalism mix, and, as in her other war novels, evaluates the political bind {{in which the}} British seek to defeat racist Nazism while upholding British colonial exploitation. The School for Love (1951) is the tale of an orphaned boy's journey of disillusionment <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>that</b> is home to Arabs, Jews and a repressive, colonial presence represented in the novel by the cold, self-righteous, and anti-Semitic character of Miss Bohun.|$|E

50|$|David Watson’s epic tale, {{based on}} the testimonies of over 200 Londoners, was a {{response}} to the mounting housing crisis and asked what it means to find some space <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>that’s</b> squeezing you out.|$|R

25|$|In 1946, Raiford {{was one of}} {{only six}} black men {{recruited}} by a then all white Greensboro Police Department. Although the tall and muscular man was proud to be a pioneering member of law enforcement, Raiford resented the way he and his fellow black officers were treated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>that</b> was then one of the more populated incorporated areas in the Tarheel state. The officers were not allowed to arrest anyone outside their ethnicity.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of sheriff is {{established by the}} Virginia Constitution, with the sheriff and his deputies having both civil and concurrent criminal jurisdiction countywide. Sheriffs terms are {{for four years and}} are not term limited. Unlike other states, the Sheriff is not necessarily the chief law enforcement officer; <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>that</b> has a police department, a Chief of Police has that distinction according to statute. However, a sheriff is chief law enforcement officer in any county. In such areas, the Chief of Police is the highest-ranking officer, such as in incorporated towns or cities.|$|E
25|$|Ethnographers {{concerned}} with the validity of activists' impressions studied a federal anti-trafficking task force <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>that</b> had {{been identified as a}} hub for domestic minor sex trafficking. In comparing local sex markets with the understandings of local social service providers, law enforcement officials, and anti-trafficking activists participating in the task force they found that many of the claims of widespread trafficking activity were either exaggerations or misinterpretations of anecdotal evidence; thus calling into question activists' ability to understand the context of what they were seeing.|$|E

25|$|The Vietnam Era {{was a time}} {{of change}} in the Fayetteville area. Fort Bragg did not send many large units to Vietnam, but from 1966 to 1970, more than 200,000 {{soldiers}} trained at the post before leaving for the war. This buildup stimulated area businesses. Anti-war protests in Fayetteville drew national attention because of Fort Bragg, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>that</b> generally supported the war. Anti-war groups invited the actress and activist Jane Fonda to Fayetteville to participate in three anti-war events. At this time, Fayetteville also made headlines after Army doctor Jeffrey R. MacDonald murdered his pregnant wife and two daughters in their Ft. Bragg home in 1970; the book and movie Fatal Vision were based on these events.|$|E
25|$|It was {{eventually}} embraced, {{or at least}} accepted, by go-go fans both young and not so young. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>that</b> considers “swing” go-go the soundtrack of its story, this was no tiny feat. Even old-timers who deny the appeal of bounce beat understand why it exists. The brash style not only changed the way people danced and partied but became the music for {{a new chapter in}} D.C.’s story. If the swing sound carried a generation of Washingtonians through the rough ’70s and ’80s, a time when funk, jazz, and soul was a much-needed salve, bounce grounded them in the ’00s and ’10s, helped them keep their bearings at a time of shifting city demographics, when go-go’s epicenter realigned as the sound of black Washington, at least from the ’70s onward, was pushed to the suburbs. With its pummeling tone and tempo, bounce beat remains a perfect musical metaphor for what young people have experienced as they’ve watched their city be slowly replaced by something unrecognizable.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the last}} few years, Abilene, Texas, has {{steadily}} become the retail, residential, business, medical, and overall center of the surrounding Big Country. Commercial development was especially boosted in 2007, with several multimillion dollar projects throughout the entire city. Most of the recent development is concentrated in roughly four areas in Abilene: Southwest Drive, Catclaw Drive, and Buffalo Gap Road near the Winters Freeway to the southwest, as this area becomes a strong commercial sector {{as well as a}} good residential district; Buffalo Gap Road, Beltway South, and US Highway 83/84 near and beyond {{the outskirts of the city}} in the south with several housing developments; Loop 322 area and Oldham Ln to the southeast, also near and past the edge of the city with a mix of several residential subdivisions as well as the start of commercial growth; and State Highway 351/Ambler Avenue near Interstate 20 to the northeast, also a combination of staple retail development, similar to the southwest commercial development, and the beginnings of residential growth with a new apartment complex and growing subdivisions. All this growth has contributed to the suburbanization of the city; however, as Abilene is not a large city itself, this is also helped the urbanization of the city as a whole. More people in the city leads to more workers and commuters <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>that</b> has a short commute time throughout the city.|$|E

5000|$|Finding {{suitable}} venues for an Eastercon (enough {{function and}} social {{space of the}} right types, enough bedrooms, low enough rates, not <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>that's</b> already hosting <b>a</b> big event on the Easter weekend, {{willing to put up}} with Eastercon's numerous unusual requirements such as supply of real ale, etc.) is a difficult job. Every year people say [...] "there must be somewhere else we can go," [...] and a lot of effort is put into trying to find new venues - usually with little success.|$|R
500|$|After the WPS later {{suspended}} {{operations in}} early 2012 due to legal and financial difficulties, Morgan joined her national teammates Hope Solo, Sydney Leroux, Megan Rapinoe and Stephanie Cox on the Seattle Sounders Women for the 2012 season. Of her signing, Morgan said, [...] "I am excited to play <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>that</b> is so passionate about soccer.

2500|$|As of 2003, the Federal City Council and the Washington Board of Trade shared many members, George Mason University {{professor}} Michael K. Fauntroy {{characterized the}} Federal City Council as [...] "more of an elitist group than the Board". As late as 1994, the Federal City Council's membership was overwhelmingly white. Terence C. Golden, the organization's chairman in 2004, admitted, [...] "This {{was basically a}} white man's business organization <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>that</b> was very divided".|$|E
2500|$|J.

We are an international business. The Coca-Cola Co. does not need Atlanta. You all need to decide whether Atlanta needs the Coca-Cola Co."

2500|$|Flynn {{has also}} said that she wanted this novel to capture the sense of {{bankruptcy}} that both individuals and communities feel when the economy spirals. Not only have both her main characters lost their jobs, they have also moved to a town that is blighted by unsold houses and failed businesses. [...] "I wanted the whole thing to feel bankrupt ... I wanted it to really feel like a marriage that had been hollowed out <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>that</b> had been hollowed out and a country that was increasingly hollowed out," [...] said Flynn.|$|E
2500|$|Cases of {{cryptosporidiosis}} {{can occur}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>that</b> {{does not have}} a contaminated water supply. In a city with clean water, it may be that cases of cryptosporidiosis have different origins. Testing of water, as well as epidemiological study, are necessary to determine the sources of specific infections. Cryptosporidium is causing serious illness [...] more frequently in immunocompromised than in apparently healthy individuals. It may chronically sicken some children, as well as adults who are exposed and immunocompromised. A subset of the immunocompromised population is people with AIDS. Some sexual behaviors can transmit the parasite directly.|$|E
2500|$|The season {{features}} {{a total of}} nine cast members {{over the course of}} the season, as one cast member is evicted and replaced, and another is replaced after he voluntarily leaves the show. It is the only season to be set in the district of Hollywood and the second season to take place <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>that</b> has hosted a previous season, as the show's [...] was set in Los Angeles in 1993. This season also makes California the most commonly used state to be used as a setting for the series. Production started from August to December 2007.

25|$|Shooting 'Put It <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Love Song' <b>in</b> Rio, in Brazil, {{was very}} incredible, I {{feel that the}} energy of the city matches {{the energy of the}} song. It's sensual, it's exciting, it's so rich with color. I loved it. The people came out so heavy and so hard. I think it was exciting, {{especially}} to participate and experience it with them like that. Me and B have a good relationship.

2500|$|Athenian {{democracy}} {{was not only}} direct {{in the sense that}} decisions were made by the assembled people, but also the most direct {{in the sense that the}} people through the assembly, boule and courts of law controlled the entire political process and a large proportion of citizens were involved constantly in the public business. Even though the rights of the individual were not secured by the Athenian constitution in the modern sense (the ancient Greeks had no word for [...] "rights"), the Athenians enjoyed their liberties not in opposition to the government but by living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>that</b> was not subject to another power and by not being subjects themselves to the rule of another person.|$|E
2500|$|On March 4 Nagin {{appeared}} {{before an audience}} of New Orleans evacuees at an event organized by the NAACP, where he made the statement that [...] "there was {{all this talk about}} this being an opportunity to change New Orleans forever and maybe everybody shouldn’t come back, and maybe this is an opportunity to kind of change New Orleans and go back to what it used to be. I have 23 candidates running for mayor and very few of them look like us. [...] There's a potential to be a major change in the political structure of New Orleans." [...] Some perceived these comments to be a divisive follow-up to his [...] "Chocolate City" [...] remarks, while others point out that the fact that Nagin is the only major African-American candidate in a field of 23 is a sign of the demographic shift <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>that</b> was over two-thirds black before Katrina.|$|E
2500|$|Willie Jefferson of the Houston Chronicle, {{after seeing}} initial promotional {{material}} for the game, considered {{that several of the}} infected [...] "appear to be African-Americans" [...] implying a racist approach to the game, and also noted that [...] "setting the game <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>that</b> was a scene of dead, bloated bodies floating by" [...] some years after the impact of Hurricane Katrina was [...] "a bad call". Faliszek, commenting on Jefferson's claims, considered the supposition to be [...] "utter insanity", and commented that the infected are a mix of all races, and that the game's version of New Orleans is [...] "not a brick-for-brick representation" [...] of the city and were not trying to make any statement about it with the game. A writer for Kotaku considered that Jefferson [...] "seems to me to be picking a fight where none exists." [...] Others noted that the appearance of African-American infected simply reflected the racial diversity of New Orleans.|$|E
5000|$|On March 25, 2015, the Detroit Free Press {{announced}} that Nicole Curtis would be restoring the home on her TV series, Rehab Addict.

For doing what I do, to be <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>that's</b> excited {{for us to be}} here and not fighting us? It's a huge thing." [...] Work on the house began in the summer of 2015. Curtis led the renovation of the 1876-built mansion for an eight-part HGTV series sponsored by Quicken Loans, the mortgage lender founded by local billionaire Dan Gilbert.
