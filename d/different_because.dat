50|$|Women with {{deleterious}} {{mutations in}} either the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes have {{a high risk of}} developing breast and/or ovarian cancer. <b>Because</b> <b>different</b> studies look at <b>different</b> populations, and <b>because</b> <b>different</b> types of mutations have somewhat different risks, the risk is best expressed as a range, rather than a single number.|$|R
25|$|The CUV is {{available}} online, {{due to its}} public domain status. The text in the online versions, however, is slightly <b>different</b> <b>because</b> Big5 does not contain all the characters needed to typeset the CUV.|$|E
25|$|According to Mahatma Gandhi, the Hindu and Buddhist {{understanding}} of nirvana are <b>different</b> <b>because</b> the nirvana of the Buddhists is shunyata, emptiness, but the nirvana of the Gita means peace {{and that is}} why it is described as brahma-nirvana (oneness with Brahman).|$|E
25|$|The quantum {{mechanical}} {{effects on}} helium-3 and helium-4 are significantly <b>different</b> <b>because</b> with two protons, two neutrons, and two electrons, helium-4 has an overall spin of zero, {{making it a}} boson, but with one fewer neutron, helium-3 has an overall spin of one half, making it a fermion.|$|E

25|$|The L3 Technologies Redundant Inertial Flight Control Assembly (RIFCA) {{guidance}} system {{used on the}} Delta IV is common to that carried on the Delta II, although the software is <b>different</b> <b>because</b> {{of the differences between}} the Delta II and Delta IV.

25|$|There are a {{multitude}} of facilities within the 6.25 hectare grounds of the shrine, {{as well as several}} structures along the 4 hectare causeway. Though other shrines in Japan also occupy large areas, Yasukuni is <b>different</b> <b>because</b> of its recent historical connections. The Yūshūkan museum is just the feature that differentiate Yasukuni from other Shinto shrines. The following lists describe many of these facilities and structures.|$|E
25|$|Experienced debate judges (who were {{generally}} debaters {{in high school}} and/or college) generally carry a mindset that favors certain arguments and styles over others. Depending on what mindset, or paradigm, the judge uses, the debate can be drastically <b>different.</b> <b>Because</b> {{there is no one}} view of debate agreed upon by everyone, many debaters question a judge about their paradigm and/or their feelings on specific arguments before the round.|$|E

25|$|While {{waterboarding}} {{has been}} depicted in several films and demonstrated at protest gatherings, images of its actual use are scarce. The CIA allegedly destroyed all videos it {{made of the}} procedure. The 1968 Washington Post photo of a captured North Vietnamese soldier being interrogated is arguably <b>different</b> <b>because</b> instead of being strapped to a board, the prisoner is held down by two soldiers as a third pours water from a canteen over a cloth covering face.|$|E
25|$|A kind of {{opposite}} of a sorting algorithm is a shuffling algorithm. These are fundamentally <b>different</b> <b>because</b> they require {{a source of}} random numbers. Interestingly, shuffling can also be implemented by a sorting algorithm, namely by a random sort: assigning a random number to each element of the list and then sorting based on the random numbers. This is generally not done in practice, however, {{and there is a}} well-known simple and efficient algorithm for shuffling: the Fisher–Yates shuffle.|$|E
25|$|Mathematics, {{first of}} all known as The Science of numbers which is {{classified}} in Arithmetic and Algebra, is classified as a formal science, has both similarities and differences with the empirical sciences (the natural and social sciences). It is similar to empirical sciences in that it involves an objective, careful and systematic study of an area of knowledge; it is <b>different</b> <b>because</b> of its method of verifying its knowledge, using a priori rather than empirical methods.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{argue that}} the {{creation}} and negotiation of self {{cannot be applied to}} all equally, that it is a Western-specific phenomena. Personal narrative, according to some, belongs [...] "within socially defined situational contexts." [...] George Gusdorf argues that in most cultures the basic unit is the community (not the self), and one cannot be said to have a self. Charlotte Linde explains that she examines the self [...] "in a particular culture" [...] <b>because</b> <b>different</b> cultures see formulations of <b>different</b> selves <b>because</b> <b>different</b> cultures have separate examples that form a culturally safe self.|$|R

25|$|Although {{classes and}} {{structures}} {{are similar in}} both {{the way they are}} declared and how they are used, there are some significant differences. Classes are reference types and structs are value types. A structure is allocated on the stack when it is declared and the variable is bound to its address. It directly contains the value. Classes are <b>different</b> <b>because</b> the memory is allocated as objects on the heap. Variables are rather managed pointers on the stack which point to the objects. They are references.|$|E
25|$|A Visual layout {{refers to}} the symbols printed on the {{physical}} keycaps. Visual layouts vary by language, country, and user preference, and any one mechanical and functional layout can be employed {{with a number of}} different visual layouts. For example, the “ISO” keyboard layout is used throughout Europe, but typical French, German, and UK variants of mechanically identical keyboards appear <b>different</b> <b>because</b> they bear different legends on their keys. Even blank keyboards – with no legends – are sometimes used to learn typing skills or by user preference.|$|E
25|$|Some {{groups of}} Celtic fans express {{their support for}} Irish republicanism and the Irish Republican Army by singing or {{chanting}} about them at matches. IRA chanting {{has been described as}} being offensive, but opinion is divided on whether they are sectarian. UEFA head of communications William Gaillard, when talking about the matter in 2006, said that IRA chanting was a nationalist issue and was similar to fans of other clubs, such as Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao, who support nationalist movements in their own countries. He also stated that only in Balkan countries, where some fans show support for organisations that had engaged in ethnic cleansing, was the situation <b>different</b> <b>because</b> these organisations were by their nature discriminatory. He said that this did not apply to the IRA.|$|E

40|$|There is {{a natural}} {{philosophical}} impulse (and, correspondingly, {{a great deal of}} pressure) to always ask for explanations, for example, explanations of why we act as we do. Kevin Mulligan has gone a very long way in disentangling the many <b>different</b> <b>because’s,</b> and the many senses of ‘because’, that tend to clutter our efforts to manage that impulse.

25|$|Mathematics, {{which is}} {{classified}} as a formal science, has both similarities and differences with the empirical sciences (the natural and social sciences). It is similar to empirical sciences in that it involves an objective, careful and systematic study of an area of knowledge; it is <b>different</b> <b>because</b> of its method of verifying its knowledge, using a priori rather than empirical methods. The formal sciences, which also include statistics and logic, are vital to the empirical sciences. Major advances in formal science have often led to major advances in the empirical sciences. The formal sciences are essential {{in the formation of}} hypotheses, theories, and laws, both in discovering and describing how things work (natural sciences) and how people think and act (social sciences).|$|E
25|$|Similar in {{use to the}} grimoires of {{ceremonial}} magicians, the Book contained {{instructions for}} how to perform rituals and spells, as well as religious poetry and chants like Eko Eko Azarak to use in those rituals. Gardner's original intention was that every copy of the Book would be <b>different,</b> <b>because</b> a student would copy from their initiators, but changing things which they felt to be personally ineffective, however amongst many Gardnerian Witches today, particularly in the United States, all copies of the Book are kept identical to the version that the High Priestess Monique Wilson copied from Gardner, with nothing being altered. The Book of Shadows was originally meant to be kept a secret from non-initiates into BTW, but parts of the Book have been published by authors including Charles Cardell, Lady Sheba, Janet Farrar and Stewart Farrar.|$|E
25|$|Two {{examples}} of periphery {{countries in the}} late 15th century and early 16th century are Poland and Latin America. At this time, Poland was mainly exporting wheat {{to other areas of}} Europe and Poland wanted cheap labor. As a result, landlords enslaved rural workers on their estate lands. Also, Latin America experienced an enslavement of their natives and imports of slaves from Africa. Forced mining labor was placed on the slaves, which enabled Latin America to export cheap goods to Europe. Both Poland and Latin America were similar during this time period because the aristocrats of these areas became more wealthy due to their interactions with the world economy. These areas of the world were also different from during medieval times in Europe. They are <b>different</b> <b>because</b> during the late 15th century and early 16th century, Poland and Latin America were producing goods and exporting them rather than simply consuming their raw goods.|$|E
