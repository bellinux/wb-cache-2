25|$|There is no given {{reason as}} to <b>how</b> <b>or</b> <b>why</b> the war broke out, though one likely theory is {{for control of}} oil reserves. In-game, the European Union and the United States fight China and the MEC. It is {{mentioned}} in-game that the US and EU are allies and the EU has negotiated a truce with Russia, but it is unknown if China and the MEC are allies. The game also takes place in different fronts, as the Middle East and China are being invaded by US and EU forces, and the United States is being invaded by Chinese and MEC forces.|$|E
25|$|The Annals state that, in {{the year}} 1002, Máel Sechnaill {{surrendered}} his title to Brian, although they do not say anything about <b>how</b> <b>or</b> <b>why</b> this came about. The Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh provides a story in which Brian challenges High King Máel Sechnaill to a battle at the Hill of Tara {{in the province of}} Meath, but the High King requests a month-long truce so that he can mobilise his forces, which Brian grants him. Máel Sechnaill fails to rally the regional rulers who are nominally his subordinates by the time the deadline arrives, and he is forced to surrender his title to Brian.|$|E

The term Nyquist Sampling Theorem (capitalized thus) appeared as early as 1959 in a book from his former employer, Bell Labs, and appeared again in 1963, and not capitalized in 1965. It had been called the Shannon Sampling Theorem as early as 1954, but also just the sampling theorem by several other books in the early 1950s.|$|R

25|$|Prior to January 1972, {{if someone}} asked Genie a {{question}} using the interrogative word where she invariably responded {{by saying the}} last word of the speaker's sentence. In early January 1972 she began to give accurate, grammatical responses to where questions in conversations. By February 1972, in everyday interactions Genie clearly understood and appropriately acted on most questions using the interrogative words who, what, where, when, why, which, and how. Unlike most children, who grasp who, what, which, and where questions much earlier than when, <b>how,</b> <b>or</b> <b>why</b> questions, {{the only one of}} these which took longer for Genie understand was why and even this took much less time than linguists expected. Because the latter group of questions require more cognitive sophistication to properly answer, the scientists offered this as additional proof that Genie had a higher level of cognitive functioning than most children in similar phases of language acquisition.|$|E
500|$|Marsh {{thought the}} problem with the album's {{narrative}} is that there isn't enough transitional material provided by the lyrics. There are no stage directions, no cast, and narration is restricted to key phrases (such as [...] "Tommy can you hear me?") Key problems included an unclear explanation of what Tommy didn't hear or see in [...] "1921", <b>how</b> <b>or</b> <b>why</b> he plays pinball, why [...] "Smash the Mirror" [...] leads into [...] "I overwhelm as I approach you" [...] (the opening line in [...] "Sensation"), why Tommy tells his followers in [...] "We're Not Gonna Take It" [...] they cannot drink or smoke but can play pinball, and what the [...] "you" [...] is in [...] "Listening to you, I get the music".|$|E
500|$|Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616, {{at the age}} of 52. He {{died within}} a month of signing his will, a {{document}} which he begins by describing himself as being in [...] "perfect health". No extant contemporary source explains <b>how</b> <b>or</b> <b>why</b> he died. Half a century later, John Ward, the vicar of Stratford, wrote in his notebook: [...] "Shakespeare, Drayton, and Ben Jonson had a merry meeting and, it seems, drank too hard, for Shakespeare died of a fever there contracted", not an impossible scenario since Shakespeare knew Jonson and Drayton. Of the tributes from fellow authors, one refers to his relatively sudden death: [...] "We wondered, Shakespeare, that thou went'st so soon/From the world's stage to the grave's tiring room." ...|$|E

We all know this hotel in which we can get anything we want, after its kind, for money; but where nobody is glad to see us, or sorry to see us, or minds (our bill paid) whether we come <b>or</b> go, <b>or</b> <b>how,</b> <b>or</b> when, <b>or</b> <b>why,</b> <b>or</b> cares about us. We all know this hotel, where we have no individuality, but put ourselves into the general post, as it were, and are sorted and disposed of according to our division. We all know that we can get on very well indeed at such a place, but still not perfectly well; and this may be, because the place is largely wholesale, and there is a lingering personal retail interest within us that asks to be satisfied.|$|R
2500|$|It {{was much}} more {{difficult}} to understand <b>how</b> it worked <b>or</b> <b>why</b> it failed. Designers gathered as much data as possible during the explosion, before the device destroyed itself, and used the data to calibrate their models, often by inserting [...] into equations to make the simulations match experimental results. They also analyzed the weapon debris in fallout to see how much of a potential nuclear reaction had taken place.|$|R
500|$|Kosygin, {{along with}} Alexey Kuznetsov and Voznesensky, formed a Troika in the {{aftermath}} of the war, with all three being promoted up the Soviet hierarchy by high-standing officials such as Stalin. There is a theory that Lavrentiy Beria and Georgy Malenkov plotted against them in 1950, and initiated what became known as the Leningrad Affair, which consisted of several fabricated criminal charges against Kuznetsov and Voznesensky. Both were executed. Kosygin's life, which was connected to Kuznetsov through marriage, was hanging by a thread. <b>How</b> <b>or</b> <b>why</b> Kosygin survived the show trials is unknown, but he, as some jokes say, [...] "must have drawn a lucky lottery ticket". Nikita Khrushchev blamed Beria and Malenkov for the innocent deaths of Kuznetsov and Voznesensky, and accused Malenkov in 1957 of having concocted the plot so that either Malenkov or Beria would succeed Stalin upon his death.|$|E
500|$|DayZ is {{praised for}} its level of {{emergent}} gameplay. BuzzFeed author Russell Brandom {{suggested that the}} mod has spawned the first photojournalist in a massively multiplayer online role-playing game, creating articles that are not only about a game world but journalism told from within it. Brandom claimed that DayZ is a unique example of the massively multiplayer online game genre in giving players the freedom to harm or murder each other, whilst adding no restrictions on <b>how</b> <b>or</b> <b>why</b> they may do it, quoting a player who described it as [...] "the story of people". The mod has been compared by Kotaku to The Walking Dead and its focus on interactions between the characters when faced with desperate situations. The players in DayZ are forced to deal with dilemmas in similar ways as portrayed in both the comics and TV series for The Walking Dead.|$|E
500|$|Gunn had a [...] "fantastic {{rapport with}} the Norwich supporters". As a player, he liked [...] "to tease the crowd during the game". Before each half of a match, Gunn would run toward his goal and pretend to attempt to headbutt the crossbar. Gunn {{says this is a}} habit he began as a youngster, and cannot {{remember}} <b>how</b> <b>or</b> <b>why</b> he began to do it. Norwich fans noticed it soon after his arrival at the club and, in Gunn's words, [...] "would wait until I got to about the 18-yard line and then start a small [...] "Wooo..." [...] which would build into a full-blown [...] "WOOOO ... AH!" ... I loved it and came close to smacking my head against the woodwork a couple of times". [...] During play, he would cup his ear, which would prompt shouts of [...] "Bryan, Bryan, give us a wave".|$|E

500|$|The Stork Club {{was owned}} and {{operated}} by Sherman Billingsley (1896–1966) an ex-bootlegger who came to New York from Enid, Oklahoma. [...] The Stork Club first opened in 1929 at 132 West 58th Street, just down the street from Billingsley's apartment at 152 West 58th Street. Billingsley's handwritten recollections of the early days recall that he was approached by two gamblers he knew from Oklahoma in his New York real estate office, proposing to open a restaurant together, which he accepted. The origin of the name of the club is unknown; Billingsley once remarked, [...] "Don't ask me <b>how</b> <b>or</b> <b>why</b> I picked the name, because I just don't remember." [...] New York City's El Morocco had the sophistication and Toots Shor's drew the sporting crowd, but the Stork Club mixed power, money, and glamor. [...] Unlike its competitors, the Stork stayed open on Sunday nights and during the summer months.|$|E
500|$|In {{the moment}} of surrender, I let go of all the {{theological}} or social questions which had kept me from [...] for countless years. I simply let them go. There was the sense, profound and wordless, that if He knew everything I {{did not have to}} know everything, and that, in seeking to know everything, I'd been, all of my life, missing the entire point. No social paradox, no historic disaster, no hideous record of injustice or misery should keep me from Him. No question of Scriptural integrity, no torment over the fate of this or that atheist or gay friend, no worry for those condemned and ostracized by my church or any other church should stand between me and Him. The reason? It was magnificently simple: He knew <b>how</b> <b>or</b> <b>why</b> everything happened; He knew the disposition of every single soul. He wasn't going to let anything happen by accident!

500|$|Soon after Bannister {{pronounced}} Hendrix dead, {{a hospital}} spokesperson told the press: [...] "We don't know where, <b>how,</b> <b>or</b> <b>why</b> he died, but {{he died of}} an overdose." [...] By that evening, many newspapers in London and New York had printed sensationalized headlines that exploited the death-from-overdose account. Hendrix's public relations manager, Les Perrin, granted an interview on Dutch radio soon after the hospital announcement. He commented: [...] "Well, all I know is that Mr. Hendrix's body was taken to St. Mary Abbots Hospital in Kensington, London, at 11:45 this morning, and he was certified to be dead on arrival." [...] At 2 p.m., BBC Radio 1 reported: [...] "Jimi Hendrix, regarded by millions {{as one of the}} most talented and original performers in modern rock music, is dead."

5000|$|As {{the plot}} reaches its climax, Cameron is shown hitting Emily and accidentally smashing {{her through a}} glass patio door, however there is a twist to the tale as all the {{suspects}} are then seen killing her one by one - all except one of them. Natasha, the only character not seen killing Emily, is seen crying and sobbing whilst shouting [...] "I'm sorry". This scene was particularly disliked by some critics, because viewers were not shown <b>how</b> <b>or</b> indeed <b>why,</b> <b>or</b> if, Natasha killed her. That, however, said the writer, was {{the crux of the}} drama, that any one of them could have, and that her position within her family had become so marginalized that she was, at times, perceived as a nuisance or problem by all of them.|$|R
