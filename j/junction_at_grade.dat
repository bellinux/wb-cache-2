50|$|SR 147 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US 60 (Midlothian Turnpike) in Midlothian. The south {{leg of the}} intersection is SR 653 (Courthouse Road), which heads south toward Chesterfield Court House. SR 147 heads north as Huguenot Road, a four-lane divided highway that heads north through the expansive commercial area that surrounds the SR 147 - US 60 intersection. The state highway veers northeast and intersects SR 711 (Robious Road) at the hamlet of Robious. The intersection also includes Norfolk Southern Railway's Richmond District rail line, which passes {{through the center of}} the <b>junction</b> <b>at</b> <b>grade.</b> SR 147 parallels the railroad east, then veers northeast through the Bon Air sections of Chesterfield County. The state highway enters the independent city of Richmond just south of its partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 150 (Chippenham Parkway).|$|E
50|$|Allerton <b>Junction</b> is an <b>at</b> <b>grade</b> <b>junction</b> {{just east}} of Liverpool South Parkway, Allerton, Merseyside. It {{takes its name from}} the former Allerton that South Parkway replaced.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} {{started at}} both ends concurrently. In the initial construction, the <b>junctions</b> were <b>at</b> <b>grade</b> separation. Although reconstruction at the Nicosia end has obliterated any evidence of this, drivers {{can still see the}} filter lanes <b>at</b> <b>junction</b> 17. The motorway was opened in stages, with the final stage (Kornos to Kophinou) completed in October 1984, while upgrades within the city of Limassol were completed in summer 2008. These upgrades included the Polemidia and Troödos junction, Agia Filaxis Junction, Agios Athanasios junction, Linopetra junction, and Germasogeia junction, and involved the replacement of a series of roundabouts with flyovers or underpasses.|$|R
25|$|Traffic {{lights and}} <b>junctions</b> are {{permitted}} <b>at</b> <b>grade</b> on dual carriageways. For older sections of dual carriageway, this {{has resulted in}} fewer flyover junctions. Newer dual carriageway sections are usually near motorway standard, with grade-separated junctions, but may not be designated as motorways due {{to the need to}} preserve access to adjoining property or to the absence of a non-motorway alternative route. Also, dual carriageways that are not motorway classified {{do not need to be}} equipped with emergency phones.|$|R
50|$|Bath Junction {{was located}} near the present site of the station. It took the name as a {{railroad}} junction of the New York & Sea Beach Railway (Sea Beach Line) with the Brooklyn, Bath Coney Island Railroad (West End Line). The NY&SB called the station <b>at</b> the <b>junction</b> Bath Junction, while the BB&CI called it Sea Beach Junction. Soon, however, they settled on the common name. Bath <b>Junction</b> was located <b>at</b> <b>grade</b> near the current intersection of New Utrecht Avenue and 62nd Street.|$|R
50|$|The A160 starts <b>at</b> a <b>grade</b> {{separated}} <b>junction</b> <b>at</b> Rye Hill on the A180 at TA136144. No other road shares this junction.|$|R
5000|$|The 21.1 km of {{line between}} Munich East and Markt Schwaben is double track and electrified. Between München-Riem West {{junction}} and Markt Schwaben the Munich S-Bahn {{does not have}} separate tracks and so S-Bahn trains have to share the line. The line speed there is currently 140 km/h and in places only 120 km/h. Electrification ends at Markt Schwaben. The 45 km of line between Markt Schwaben and Ampfing is only single track despite substantial passenger and freight traffic. The section from Ampfing to Altmühldorf has been doubled; work was completed in December 2010 {{at a cost of}} around € 50 million. [...] Ampfing station was redesigned as part of this project and received two new exterior platforms and was made fully accessible for the disabled. In addition, the entire upgraded section has been rebuilt with flying <b>junctions</b> to remove <b>at</b> <b>grade</b> crossings; some of this work was done years ago. The final section between Altmühldorf and Mühldorf is only single-track.|$|R
50|$|After three blocks, LA 26 {{reaches the}} town's main <b>junction</b> <b>at</b> US 165, {{connecting}} with Kinder and Oakdale. The roadway narrows {{again as the}} highway immediately crosses the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) tracks <b>at</b> <b>grade.</b> After passing through another residential section for a few blocks, LA 26 curves southeast out of town then due east again to follow a section line road. 4 mi later, the highway curves due south and will keep this trajectory {{for the remainder of}} its journey, its directional banners changing accordingly from east-west to north-south. 1.5 mi along the way, LA 26 intersects LA 104, which heads east toward Mamou in neighboring Evangeline Parish.|$|R

50|$|Another {{branch line}} was opened from a <b>junction</b> <b>at</b> Kabra, near Rockhampton to Mount Morgan in 1898 (including a rack section) and {{extended}} to Wowan in 1912 and Baralaba in 1917. A branch line was built from a <b>junction</b> <b>at</b> Rannes to Thangool in 1925. A branch line was opened from a <b>junction</b> <b>at</b> Dakenba to Callide in 1953.|$|R
