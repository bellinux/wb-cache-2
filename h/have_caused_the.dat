5|$|The {{declaration}} {{had many}} long-lasting consequences.

Controversy remains over a number of areas, such as whether the declaration contradicted earlier promises the British made to the Sharif of Mecca in the McMahon–Hussein correspondence.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} rising {{importance}} of a central administration arose {{a new class of}} educated scribes and officials who were granted estates by the pharaoh in payment for their services. Pharaohs also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples, to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the pharaoh after his death. Scholars believe that five centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic power of the pharaoh, and that the economy could no longer afford to support a large centralized administration. As the power of the pharaoh diminished, regional governors called nomarchs began to challenge the supremacy of the pharaoh. This, coupled with severe droughts between 2200 and 2150BC, is assumed to <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> country to enter the 140-year period of famine and strife known as the First Intermediate Period.|$|E

5|$|At the 2013 inquest {{into the}} roof {{collapse}} (see Government reaction below), testimony {{has revealed that}} many unpublicized structural problems at the mall dated {{all the way back}} to its initial construction in the late 1970s. In particular, the expansion joint above the escalators, the failure of which appears to <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> roof deck collapse, was already not properly binding to the concrete, in turn allowing water to seep into the building's seams, as early as 1981 — barely a year after the mall's original opening. The expansion joint was fixed many times, and fully replaced twice, during the building's lifetime, yet always began tearing away from the concrete again shortly after the repairs were complete.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Lisa {{go fishing}} {{downstream}} of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, and Springfield Shopper reporter Dave Shutton pulls {{up just as}} Bart catches a three-eyed fish, much to both the kids' and Shutton's surprise. The fish, nicknamed Blinky by the media, makes headlines around the state, and incumbent governor Mary Bailey calls in a government inspection team to investigate nuclear waste coming from the plant that could <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> fish to mutate. After the inspection, the plant's owner, Mr. Burns, is presented {{with a list of}} 342 violations, which would cost $56 million to rectify. Distraught, Mr. Burns talks to plant employee Homer, who half-heartedly suggests Mr. Burns run for governor against Bailey so that he could change the standards and prevent the plant from being shut down. Mr. Burns instantly pounces on the idea.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{scarcity}} of published archaeological material and the misdating of some sites {{may have contributed to}} the low number of archaeological sites that can be attributed to the Hungarians in the steppes, according to archaeologist László Kovács. Kovács also says that the Hungarians' migration from the steppes and their settlement in the Carpathian Basin may <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> development of a new material culture, rendering the identification of pre-conquest Hungarians difficult. Archaeological research has demonstrated that the material culture of the Avars and other steppe peoples who settled in the Carpathian Basin before the Hungarians experienced a similarly significant change after they left the steppes and settled in their new homeland.|$|E

5|$|Dinocephalosaurus {{may also}} have used its neck to capture its prey via suction feeding. After flexing its neck to the side (which would have been {{facilitated}} by the slenderness of the cervical ribs), the act of straightening the neck would <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> cervical ribs to splay outwards due to {{the action of the}} neck muscles attached to the ribs. As the head lunged forward, the volume of the esophagus would have increased, creating suction. Once the prey was caught, the fang-like teeth would have secured the prey in the mouth. Like other aquatic amniotes, Dinocephalosaurus would have swallowed and digested its prey head-first, as evinced by the preservation of a perleidid fish in the abdominal region of LPV 30280 from Luoping.|$|E

Tandy stopped his Porsche briefly at the pit lane entry, while Bonanomi went wide driving up to Radallion corner battling Wurz for sixth. The incident involving Hartley handed the No. 17 Porsche a 15-second, stop-and-go penalty as he was deemed not to have respected track limits and causing danger to marshals. Bernhard took the penalty on the 17th lap, promoting teammate Jani to the lead. Evans moved {{to the front of}} the LMP2 field after overtaking Canal heading into the Bus Stop chicane.

5|$|From {{the initial}} {{planning}} stages, proponents and opponents {{speculated that the}} large size of the reservoir created by the dam could affect the weather in Interior Alaska and the Yukon. Several studies were conducted in regards to these potential changes, {{and most of the}} reports hypothesized an effect similar to the weather that occurs around Great Slave Lake and Lake Baikal, both of which were of similar sizes and latitudes to the proposed reservoir. Forecasts predicted the lake would hold in heat longer during the autumn, thus keeping area temperatures slightly warmer than normal. In the spring, however, the area around the lake would have been prone to increased precipitation due to the phenomenon of lake-effect snow. In the summer, the long periods of daylight would <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> land around the lake to become warmer than the lake itself, also creating the possibility of storms.|$|E
