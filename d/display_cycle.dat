40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to outline a {{methodology}} to transform depth intervals into geological time intervals. Working in a geochronological system aids in the understanding of the physical properties of rocks and to do very precise correlations between wells. To transform the present coordinates a high resolution tool is necessary : the FMI® (Fullbore Formation MicroImager, Schlumberger). First, well log correlations are established between seven wells at different scales. Relative variations of sedimentation rate are observed locally. Second, FMI® images analysis are used to reveal clear carbonate - clay interbedding which <b>display</b> <b>cycles.</b> Third, to study these cycles, geostatistical tools are used. The variographic analysis of conventional log data shows cycles of one meter. With FMI® data, smaller cyles can be detected. Variogram modelling and factorial kriging analysis suggest that three spatial periods exist. They vary vertically and laterally in wells but cycle ratios are stable and similar to orbital cycle (Milankovitch cycle) ratios. The three periods correspond to eccentricity, obliquity and precession. If orbital cycles are known, depth intervals can be converted into geological time intervals and thus give real sedimentation rates and quantification of hiatus duration...|$|R
40|$|The paper uncovers {{evidence}} that the end ofthe Cold War has provided a dividend In terms of reduced transnational terrorism. Significant short-run and long-run effects are quantified with time series analysis to be concentrated In reduced bombings and hostage-taking Incidents. Presumably, this dividend Is the result of less state-sponsorship of terrorism by the Commonwealth of Independent States and other states, {{as well as the}} result of measures taken by Industrial states to thwart terrorist attacks. A dividend does not appear until the last three quarters of 1994, at which times moves were well underway to Integrate Eastern Europe with the West. Moreover, prior to this period, significant efforts had been made among Western nations to augment cooperative efforts to curb terrorism and to bring terrorists to justice. Using data for 1970 through mid- 1996, we also examine trends and cycles In terrorist modes of attack. There Is virtually no evidence of an upward trend In transnational terrorism, contrary to media characterizations. All types of terrorist incidents <b>display</b> <b>cycles</b> whose duration lengthens with logistical complexity.

40|$|Scaled sandbox {{experiments}} with high basal friction, simulating {{the growth of}} accretionary wedges, <b>display</b> <b>cycles</b> alternating between frontal imbricate thrusting and underthrusting of long, undeformed sheets. By contrast, low basal friction {{experiments with}} otherwise similar and constant, initial conditions produce a classic frontal imbricate fan through repeated failure along frontal thrusts. The cyclical behavior observed in high basal friction experiments is expressed by three quantities: (1) the average spacing between frontal thrusts, (2) the advance and retreat of the deformation front, and (3) the frontal slope (Alpha) of the actively deforming wedge. As a long sheet is underthrust, the front is steepened through slumping until the maximum critical angle is reached. Then frontal thrusting resumes and the accretion of imbricate slices builds the wedge forward, thereby lowering the taper to the minimum critical angle. At shallow tapers, a long unit is underthrust and subsequently uplifts, shortens, and steepens the overlying wedge through backthrust deformation, thus completing the cycle. Underthrusting of long units offers a simple mechanism for underplating overlying units. It also provides a possible explanation for temporally and spatially varying wedge geometries in nature, when basal frictions attain 80 %– 90 % of the internal friction...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{reconstruct}} quantitatively the Middle to Upper Miocene climate evolution in the southern Forecarpathian Basin (Central Paratethys area, Northwest Bulgaria) by applying the coexistence approach to 101 well-dated palynofloras isolated from three cores. The climatic evolution is compared with changes in vegetation and palaeogeography. The Middle Miocene {{was a period of}} a subtropical/warm-temperate humid climate with mean annual temperature (MAT) between 16 and 18 °C and mean annual precipitation (MAP) between 1100 and 1300 mm. Thereby, during the entire Middle Miocene a trend of slightly decreasing temperatures is observed and only small climate fluctuations occur which are presumably related to palaeogeographic reorganisations. The vegetation shows a corresponding trend with a decrease in abundance of palaeotropic and thermophilous elements. The Upper Miocene is characterised by more diverse climatic conditions, probably depending on palaeogeographic and global climatic transformations. The beginning of this period is marked by a slight cooling and a significant drying of the climate, with MAT 13. 3 - 17 °C and MAP 652 - 759 mm. After that, fluctuations of all palaeoclimate parameters occur <b>displaying</b> <b>cycles</b> of humid/dryer and warmer/cooler conditions, which are again well reflected in the vegetation.
