Using commercially {{available}} magnetic modeling software we have modeled the signal of Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL) testing of steel pipes with {{different types of}} defects, including inside, outside and tilted notches in 2 D. The results presented here show interesting dependencies of signal amplitude and width on the defect geometry, which may be useful for <b>defect</b> <b>separation.</b> The implemented method can easily be adopted for different testing geometries and pipe materials. 1...|$|E

40|$|Defects that {{propagate}} {{from the}} inside of a structure can be difficult to detect by traditional non-destructive inspection methods. A non-contact inspection method is presented here that uses the near-field interactions of ultrasonic Lamb waves to detect defects propagating into a 1. 5 mm thick aluminium sheet from the opposite side to that which is inspected. Near-field interactions of the S 0 Lamb waves with the defects are shown to give rise to a characteristic increase in the wave magnitude, which is used to position and characterise these hidden defects. It is shown that such defects are difficult to detect from a study of their influence on ultrasonic transmission alone. Single defects of different depths, and systems of multiple <b>defects</b> with varying <b>separations</b> and relative depths, are successfully detected in both experimental trials and FEM simulations.

Cytoplasmic streaming in plant cells is a prominent and ubiquitous example, in which cargo-carrying molecular motors move along polymer filaments and generate coherent cell-scale flow. When filaments are not fixed to the cell periphery, a situation found both in vivo and in vitro, we observe that the basic dynamics of streaming {{are closely related to}} those of a non-motile stresslet suspension. Under this model, it is demonstrated that confinement makes possible a stable circulating state; a linear stability analysis reveals an activity threshold for spontaneous auto-circulation.

The hole can be drilled in the pipe end region which will be cut in further production. The fast recalibration is important if quantitative testing including <b>defect</b> <b>separation</b> is required but small lot sizes would normally lead to very frequent calibration cycles. In this work we present a calculation of MFL signals of standard notches and drill-holes with the goal of finding a corresponding calibration scheme. The work is based on finite element modelling (FEM).

40|$|The “order {{parameter}} ” {{for describing}} low-temperature configurations of an m-vector spin glass is an O(m) orthogonal matrix R(T), representing a rotation of one configuration relatiue to another, which is relatively slowly varying in space. The {{meaning of a}} “defect ” description of the low-lying metastable states is clarified and the topologically stable defects and textures of R(F) are reviewed. R(1) is generalized to a more general (m x m matrix) order parameter with longitudinal degrees of freedom, which in a hydrodynamic picture {{are associated with a}} longitudinal spin-stiffness constant and a spin-configuration “flattening ” energy. It is shown that, in the most useful form of the Edwards-Anderson correlation function, the longitudinal fluctuations must be projected out. The relation of “defect ” pictures to the phenomenological “two-level system ” models and to experiments is discussed.

40|$|Theoretical calculations, {{based on}} hybrid {{exchange}} density functional theory, {{are used to}} show that in graphene a periodic array of defects generates a ferromagnetic ground state {{at room temperature for}} unexpectedly large defect separations. This is demonstrated for defects that consist of a carbon vacancy in which two of the dangling bonds are saturated with H atoms. The magnetic coupling mechanism is analysed and found to be due to an instability in the π electron system with respect to a long-range spin polarisation characterised by alternation in the spin direction between adjacent carbon atoms. The disruption of the π-bonding opens a semiconducting gap at the Fermi edge. The size of the energy gap and the magnetic coupling strength are strong functions of the <b>defect</b> <b>separation</b> and can thus be controlled by varying the defect concentration. The position of the semiconducting energy gap and the electron effective mass are strongly spin-dependent and this is expected to result in a spin asymmetry in the transport properties of the system.

40|$|Defects usually play an {{important}} role in tuning and modifying various properties of semiconducting or insulating materials. Therefore we study the impact of point and line defects on the electronic structure and optical properties of MoS 2 monolayers using density-functional methods. The different types of defects form electronic states that are spatially localized on the defect. The strongly localized nature is reflected in weak electronic interactions between individual point or line defect and a weak dependence of the defect formation energy on the defect concentration or line <b>defect</b> <b>separation.</b> In the electronic energy spectrum the defect states occur as deep levels in the band gap, as shallow levels very close to the band edges, as well as levels in-between the bulk states. Due to their strongly localized nature, all states of point defects are sharply peaked in energy. Periodic line defects form nearly dispersionless one-dimensional band structures and the related spectral features are also strongly peaked. The electronic structure of the monolayer system is quite robust and it is well preserved for point defect concentrations of up to 6 %. The impact of point defects on the optical absorption for concentrations of 1 % and below is found to be very small. For higher defect concentrations molybdenum vacancies were found to quench the overall absorption and sulfur defects lead to sharp absorption peaks below the absorption edge of the ideal monolayer. For line defects, we did not find a considerable impact on the absorption spectrum. These results support recent experiments on defective transition metal chalcogenides.

40|$|Abstract Background Guanylic {{nucleotides}} {{are both}} macromolecules constituents and crucial regulators {{for a variety}} of cellular processes. Therefore, their intracellular concentration must be strictly controlled. Consistently both yeast and mammalian cells tightly correlate the transcription of genes encoding enzymes critical for guanylic nucleotides biosynthesis with the proliferation state of the cell population. Results To gain insight into the molecular relationships connecting intracellular guanylic nucleotide levels and cellular proliferation, we have studied the consequences of guanylic nucleotide limitation on Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle progression. We first utilized mycophenolic acid, an immunosuppressive drug that specifically inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, the enzyme catalyzing the first committed step in de novo GMP biosynthesis. To approach this system physiologically, we next developed yeast mutants for which the intracellular guanylic nucleotide pools can be modulated through changes of growth conditions. In both the pharmacological and genetic approaches, we found that guanylic nucleotide limitation generated a mother-daughter <b>separation</b> <b>defect,</b> characterized by cells with two unseparated daughters. We then showed that this <b>separation</b> <b>defect</b> resulted from cell wall perturbations but not from impaired cytokinesis. Importantly, cells with similar <b>separation</b> <b>defects</b> were found in a wild type untreated yeast population entering quiescence upon nutrient limitation. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that guanylic nucleotide limitation slows budding yeast cell cycle progression, with a severe pause in telophase. At the cellular level, guanylic nucleotide limitation causes the emergence of cells with two unseparated daughters. By fluorescence and electron microscopy, we demonstrate that this phenotype arises from defects in cell wall partition between mother and daughter cells. Because cells with two unseparated daughters are also observed in a wild type population entering quiescence, our results reinforce the hypothesis that guanylic nucleotide intracellular pools contribute to a signal regulating both cell proliferation and entry into quiescence. </p...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} six {{methods to}} improve the characterisation of solar cells via photoluminescence techniques. The first two methods use photoluminescence images under combined voltage bias and illuminations to calculate spatially resolved essential parameters. These quantitative images of parameters such as current density, dark saturation current density J 01 and J 02 and efficiency are useful to check the location and magnitude of the defects. Therefore {{the performance of the}} solar cell could be well-characterised using these approaches. The third method is the series resistance separation method. A series resistance image can be separated into natural and defect-related components. Through this, the series resistance of the solar cell can be better understood. The fourth method is the front and rear <b>defect</b> <b>separation</b> method. By utilising this method, the vertical characterisation of solar cells can be achieved. The fifth method is the area calculation method. This method calculates the active area and total area of the solar cell; and simultaneously, the position of the active area is recorded, which can be used for further analysis. The sixth method is the voltage and effective lifetime imaging method. The core advantages of this method are that it virtually eliminates the horizontal balancing current when the cell is on open-circuit and no calibration is required. All the methods explained in this thesis are feasible for use in industry. This is because all the methods only require an existing commercial photoluminescence system and no additional equipment is needed.

40|$|Coherent {{coupling}} between single quantum objects is at {{the heart}} of modern quantum physics. When coupling is strong enough to prevail over decoherence, it can be used for the engineering of correlated quantum states. Especially for solid-state systems, control of quantum correlations has attracted widespread attention because of applications in quantum computing. Such coherent coupling has been demonstrated in a variety of systems at low temperature 1, 2. Of all quantum systems, spins are potentially the most important, because they offer very long phase memories, sometimes even at room temperature. Although precise control of spins is well established in conventional magnetic resonance 3, 4, existing techniques usually do not allow the readout of single spins because of limited sensitivity. In this paper, we explore dipolar magnetic coupling between two single defects in diamond (nitrogen-vacancy and nitrogen) using optical readout of the single nitrogen-vacancy spin states. Long phase memory combined with a <b>defect</b> <b>separation</b> of a few lattice spacings allow us to explore the strong magnetic coupling regime. As the two-defect system was well-isolated from other defects, the long phase memory times of the single spins was not diminished, despite the fact that dipolar interactions are usually seen as undesirable sources of decoherence. A coherent superposition of spin pair quantum states was achieved. The dipolar coupling was used to transfer spin polarisation from a nitrogen-vacancy centre spin to a nitrogen spin, with optical pumping of a nitrogen-vacancy centre leading to efficient initialisation. At the level anticrossing efficient nuclear spin polarisation was achieved. Our results demonstrate an important step towards controlled spin coupling and multi-particle entanglement in the solid state...|$|E

In this report, we investigate {{the role of}} two previously uncharacterized Rho proteins, encoded by the Candida albicans RHO 3 (CaRHO 3) and CaCRL 1 /CaRHO 4 genes. The CaRHO 3 gene was found to contain one intron. Promoter shutdown experiments using a MET 3 promoter-controlled RHO 3 revealed a strong cell polarity defect and a partially depolarized actin cytoskeleton. Hyphal growth after promoter shutdown was abolished in rho 3 mutants even {{in the presence of}} a constitutively active ras 1 (G 13 V) allele, and existing germ tubes became swollen. Deletion of C. albicans RHO 4 indicated that it is a nonessential gene and that rho 4 mutants were phenotypically different from rho 3. Two distinct phenotypes of rho 4 cells were elongated cell morphology and an unexpected cell <b>separation</b> <b>defect</b> generating chains of cells. Colony morphology of crl 1 /rho 4 resulted in a growth-dependent smooth (long cell cycle length) or wrinkled (short cell cycle length) phenotype. This phenotype was additionally dependent on the rho 4 cell <b>separation</b> <b>defect</b> and was also found in a Cacht 3 chitinase mutant that shows a strong cytokinesis defect. The overexpression of the endoglucanase encoding the ENG 1 gene, but not CHT 3, suppressed the cell <b>separation</b> <b>defect</b> of crl 1 /rho 4 but could not suppress the cell elongation phenotype. C. albicans Crl 1 /Rho 4 and Bnr 1 both localize to septal sites in yeast and hyphal cells but not to the hyphal tip. Deletion of RHO 4 and BNR 1 produced similar morphological phenotypes.

We have created a conditional allele of skp 1 (skp 1 - 3 f) mimicking the mutation in the budding yeast skp 1 - 3 allele. Although budding yeast skp 1 - 3 arrests at the G(1) /S transition, skp 1 - 3 f cells progress through S phase and instead display two distinct phenotypes. A fraction of the skp 1 - 3 f cells arrest in mitosis with high Cdc 2 activity.

We reviewed the technique, and used demonstrations from prior work by others in presentations on the technique and how we plan to develop it. Coils were wound; a jig for pulling the coils through the pipe was manufactured; defects were machined in one six-inch diameter, ten-foot long pipe; and the equipment was assembled. After completing first crude pullout test to show that RFEC inspection would work, we repeated the experiment with a proper jig and got excellent results. The test showed the expected behavior, with the direct field dominating the signal to about two pipe diameters from the drive coil, and the remote field dominating for greater separations between the drive coil and the sensing coils. Response of RFEC to a typical defect was measured, as was the sensitivity to defect size.

40|$|Owing {{to their}} {{versatile}} orbital character with {{both local and}} highly dispersive degrees of freedom, transition metal oxides span the range of ionic, covalent and metallic bonding. They exhibit a vast diversity of electronic phenomena such as high dielectric, piezoelectric, pyroelectric, ferroelectric, magnetic, multiferroic, catalytic, redox, and superconductive properties. The nature of these properties arises from sensitive details in the electronic structure, e. g. orbital mixing and orbital hybridization, due to non-stoichiometry, atomic displacements, broken symmetries etc., and their coupling with external perturbations. In the work presented here, these variations of the electronic structure of crystals due to structural and electronic defects have been investigated, exemplarily for the quasi-binary system SrO - SrTiO 3 - TiO 2. A number of binary and ternary structures have been studied, both experimentally {{as well as by}} means of electronic modeling. The applied methods comprise Resonant X-ray Scattering techniques like Diffraction Anomalous Fine Structure, Anisotropy of Anomalous Scattering and X-ray Absorption Fine Structure, and simultaneously extensive electronic calculations by means of Density Functional Theory and Finite Difference Method Near-Edge Structure to gain a thorough physical understanding of the underlying processes, interactions and dynamics. It is analyzed in detail how compositional variations, e. g. manifesting as oxygen vacancies or ordered stacking faults, alter the short-range order and affect the electronic structure, and how the severe changes in mechanical, optical, electrical as well as electrochemical properties evolve. Various symmetry-property relations have been concluded and interpreted {{on the basis of these}} modifications in electronic structure for the orbital structure in rutile TiO 2, for distorted TiO 6 octahedra and related switching mechanisms of the Ti valence, for elasticity and resistivity in strontium titanate, and for surface relaxations in Ruddlesden-Popper phases. Highlights of the thesis include in particular the methodical development regarding Resonant X-Ray Diffraction, such as the first use of partially forbidden reflections to get the complete phase information not only of the tensorial structure factor but of each individual atomic scattering tensor for a whole spectrum of energies, as well as the determination of orbital degrees of freedom and details of the partial local density of states from these tensors.

40|$|This thesis {{has been}} {{concerned}} with a few problems in systems driven at the scale of particles. The problems dealt with here can be extended and elaborated upon {{in a variety of}} ways. In 2 we examine the dynamics of a ﬂuid membrane in contact with a ﬂuid containing active particles. In particular, we show that such a membrane generically enters a statistical steady state with wave-like dispersion. While the numerical results are satisfying, a one-step coarse-graining calculation, in line with [66, 93], will, we expect, yield a pair of coupled stochastic diﬀerential equations (probably KPZ like at least in one dimension) with wave-like dispersion. This calculation in of interest from a theoretical point-of-view. Further, the numerical exploration of the full set of equations is also left for future work, but can be relevant to many biological systems. In 3 we show that an active ﬂuid conﬁned in an annular channel starts to rotate spontaneously. Further, we predict the existence of banded concentration proﬁle. Such proﬁles have not yet been observed in experiments. Further, {{it will be interesting to}} study what happens to our conclusions if we include the eﬀect of treadmilling in our calculation. In 4 we describe a solid driven by active particles. Speciﬁcally, we only concern ourselves with the polar elastomeric phase of the material. However, the questions regarding the transition into that phase are interesting and have not been explored. How exactly does a polarisation transition happen in an active polar elastomer? Is it the same as in an active nematic elastomer? What is the nature of the gelation transition in an active polar ﬂuid? What is the dynamics of nematic defects in an elastomer? Can the presence of the elastomer prevent <b>defect</b> <b>separation?</b> We are at present trying to answer these questions. In 5 we examine the dynamics of an active ﬂuid conﬁned in a channel. It will be interesting to test the prediction about ﬂuctuations in a conﬁned active system, which we show will be normal, in experiments on highly conﬁned actomyosin systems. In 6 we write down the coupled equations of a conformation tensor and the apolar order parameter. This is a generic framework for studying viscoelastic active ﬂuids. A fuller study of the eﬀect of increasing the cross-linker density in such system remains to be done, both theoretically and experimentally. In general, we have shown in the thesis that the understanding of active systems can provide a mechanistic explanation of various biological observations. However, at times the comparison between theory and biological experiments become complicated due to the inherently complicated nature of the experimental systems. Thus, for a more rigorous experimental test of the theory, it is necessary to construct cleaner reconstituted systems with possibly as few as three components. Eﬀorts in this direction have recently borne fruit [129]. However, a complete theoretical understanding of the rich behaviour evinced in these systems is as yet lacking. We expect that the conformation tensor theory we developed in chapter 6 will provide an explanation for the anomalous rheological behaviour observed in these systems. Even in the theoretical front, lot of questions remain to be answered. The dry polar active system, described by the Toner-Tu equations have been shown to undergo a transition to a state with LRO. However, though mean-ﬁeld theory predicts a second order transition [151, 152, 156], detailed numerical analysis suggests that it is actually ﬁrst-order with pre-transitional solitonic bands. This has been recently examined by Chate et al. [26] who mapped it to a dynamical system, but a complete theory is still lacking. Apolar systems present another set of challenges. First, the concentration coupling with the order parameter should create similar pre-transitional eﬀects at the order-disorder transition for this system also. This has been studied to a certain extent [133]. However, the more interesting question concerns the role of defects in apolar systems and whether they allow for the possibility of even QLRO in two dimensions. The + 1 / 2 nematic defect has a polarity, and can thus move balistically [51, 108, 115, 149] in a dry system. However, the − 1 / 2 defect has a three-fold symmetry [27] and its motion is thus purely diﬀusive. Now consider a pair of + 1 / 2 and − 1 / 2 defect pair that can form due to noise in the system (since it does not violate charge conservation). Depending on the conﬁguration and the kind of activity, this defect pair can unbind at zero temperature. Unbound defects would imply that the order is short-ranged. However, it appears from detailed simulations of an agent based Vicsek-like model of active nematics, that there exists a QLRO nematic in two dimensions [111]! How does an active nematic escape being destroyed by defect unbinding? Does concentration have a major role to play? If so, does making the concentration a non-conserved, and thus fast, variable by, for example, including evaporation-deposition rules in the model studied by Chate et al. [28] destroy the QLRO? Also, does the hydrodynamic theory for Malthusian (i. e. one in which the concentration relaxes fast to a steady value) nematics show only short-ranged order, while the one in which mass is conserved show QLRO? These questions are being studied at present by simulating both the agent-based model due to Chate with evaporation-deposition and the dynamical equation for the active nematic order-parameter. These studies should clarify the role of concentration in assisting apolar order. It must be borne in mind, however, that numerical simulations of active models are more diﬃcult than their passive counterparts due to the larger number of parameters present in the problem. In passive systems Onsager symmetry relations constrain some parameters. However, the absence of an equivalent rule for systems far away from equilibrium implies that the spatial symmetry allowed couplings will all have independent kinetic coeﬃcients. This increases the size of the parameter space in many problems. Also, many techniques like Monte Carlo have to be carefully modiﬁed to suit such systems. A new and exciting area of research from the point of view of statistical mechanics of active systems is an examination of collective behaviour of run-and-tumble particles pioneered by Tailleur and Cates [25]. This has led to fruitful active generalisations of models of dynamic critical phenomena like model B and model H. Also, it has led to an exploration of rules for selecting a state in a region of phase coexistence – an out of equilibrium generalisation of the Maxwell construction. Another interesting avenue is building up active matter equations from microscopics. This has been done for Vicsek model by Thomas Ihle [64, 65], for a simple generalisation of Vicsek-type model for both polar and apolar alignment interactions by Bertin et al. and Chate et al. [15, 16, 107], and for a model of hard rods by Marchetti et al. [10, 11]. The issues of closure still remain to be fully resolved however in deriving the macroscopic equations. A particularly exciting new system that has been recently studied extensively is a collection of chemotactic Janus particles [127]. The far-ﬁeld interaction in this case does not promote polar order but state with proliferation of asters. The coarse-grained hydrodynamic equations have been derived in this case starting from a microscopic picture of colloids coated axisymetrically with a catalyst in an inhomogeneous concentration of reactants by Saha et al. [127]. Another theoretical issue that plagues the derivation of hydrodynamic equations is that of noise. So far most theories have modelled the noise as Gaussian and white, akin to equilibrium systems, but with unknown strength. However, it is likely that the noise also depends on activity, thus requiring a microscopic picture treating the active forces as stochastic quantities. It is known that multiplicative character of the noise induces interesting features at least in the case of active nematics [104]. Thus, a lot of questions need to be answered if theories of active matter have to graduate from merely oﬀering qualitative explanations of biological experiments to becoming the prototypical theory of systems in which energy input and dissipation both occur at a scale smaller than the coarse-graining volume...|$|E
40|$|Duplication of centrosomes {{once per}} cell cycle is {{essential}} for bipolar spindle formation and genome maintenance and is controlled in part by cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). Our study identifies Sfi 1, a conserved component of centrosomes, as the first Cdk substrate required to restrict centrosome duplication to once per cell cycle. We found that reducing Cdk 1 phosphorylation by changing Sfi 1 phosphorylation sites to nonphosphorylatable residues leads to <b>defects</b> in <b>separation</b> of duplicated spindle pole bodies (SPBs, yeast centrosomes) and to inappropriate SPB reduplication during mitosis. These cells also display defects in bipolar spindle assembly, chromosome segregation, and growth. Our findings lead to a model whereby phosphoregulation of Sfi 1 by Cdk 1 has the dual function of promoting SPB separation for spindle formation and preventing premature SPB duplication. In addition, we provide evidence that the protein phosphatase Cdc 14 has the converse role of activating licensing, likely via dephosphorylation of Sfi 1...|$|R

ICF 2, caused by biallelic ZBTB 24 gene mutations, is acknowledged primarily as an isolated B-cell defect. Here, we extend the phenotype spectrum by describing, in particular, {{for the first time}} the development of a combined immune defect throughout the disease course as well as putative autoimmune phenomena such as granulomatous hepatitis and nephritis. We also demonstrate impaired cell-proliferation and increased cell death of immune and non-immune cells as well as data suggesting a chromosome <b>separation</b> <b>defect</b> in addition to the known chromosome condensation defect...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} to suppress agglomeration of MnBi alloy particles during milling and their unwanted sintering during subsequent annealing was explored by embedding the particles in CaO through co-milling. A 15 h annealing of the micron-sized MnBi particles {{embedded in the}} CaO matrix at 300 °C is not accompanied by sintering or growth of the particles while it significantly increases their coercivity – presumably by healing the milling-induced crystal <b>defects.</b> After <b>separation</b> from the CaO matrix, the annealed MnBi powder combines a calculated energy product of 10 MGOe with a room-temperature coercivity of 14. 4 kOe. At the same time, the partial loss and degradation of the MnBi low-temperature phase during warm compaction of the powders makes {{the effect of the}} CaO-matrix annealing less pronounced in the case of fully dense magnets; the residue from the solvents employed for the removal of the CaO might have contributed to the decline of the properties. Still, a relatively high room-temperature coercivity of 8. 5 kOe was obtained for the fuslly-dense MnBi magnet exhibiting an energy product of 5. 3 MGOe...|$|R
40|$|Mutations in CUC 1 and CUC 2 (for CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON), {{which are}} newly {{identified}} genes of Arabidopsis, caused <b>defects</b> in the <b>separation</b> of cotyledons (embryonic organs), sepals, and stamens (floral organs) {{as well as}} in the formation of shoot apical meristems. These defects were most apparent in the double mutant. Phenotypes of the mutants suggest a common mechanism for separating adjacent organs within the same whorl in both embryos and flowers. We cloned the CUC 2 gene and found that the encoded protein was homologous to the petunia NO APICAL MERISTEM (NAM) protein, which is thought to act in the development of embryos and flowers...|$|R

40|$|The insertional {{inactivation}} of the dlt operon from Lactobacillus plantarum NCIMB 8826 {{had a strong}} impact on lipoteichoic acid (LTA) composition, resulting in a major reduction in D-alanyl ester content. Unexpectedly, mutant LTA showed high levels of glucosylation and were threefold longer than wild-type LTA. The dlt mutation resulted in a reduced growth rate and increased cell lysis during the exponential and stationary growth phases. Microscopy analysis revealed increased cell length, damaged dividing cells, and perforations of the envelope in the septal region. The observed <b>defects</b> in the <b>separation</b> process, cell envelope perforation, and autolysis of the dlt mutant could be partially attributed to the L. plantarum Acm 2 peptidoglycan hydrolase.

40|$|Morphogenesis is {{critical}} to the development of multicellular organisms. Morphogenesis is also a complex process that requires the coordination of many events, including cell division, cytoskeletal reorganization, cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. To investigate a driving mechanism of morphogenesis in organ formation, we characterized a group of C. elegans mutants defective in vulval morphogenesis. We established that the morphogenetic defect is caused by disruption in biosynthesis of chondroitin glycosaminoglycans by molecular identification and characterization of five sqv (uashed vulva) genes. Glycosaminoglycans are known to function in development by binding a large repertoire of ligands involved in morphogenesis and wound healing, in some cases by modulating certain conserved signaling pathways, and in providing structural support in the extracellular matrix. Defects in biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans can cause connective tissue diseases. We found that regulation of sqv- 4 likely controls glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis and the aspect of vulval morphogenesis driven by chondroitin. We also characterized specific <b>defects</b> in <b>separation</b> of the plasma membrane from the eggshell and failure to initiate cytokinesis caused by mutations in sqv genes in the one-cell embryo. by Ho-Yon Hwang.

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{deals with}} {{propagation}} of <b>defects</b> and <b>separations</b> in tyres which are under dynamic load. The initiation {{and distribution of}} the defect has the significant influence on lifetime {{and quality of the}} tyre when the tyre is in service {{as a part of the}} vehicle and avoidance to the initiation and distribution of the defect can improve the safety on the road. The analysis mentioned in previous projects enabled us to solve critical conditions and problems in relation to tyre casing while the investigation and solution included material selection, suitability of individual components proportion as well as the whole construction of the tyre casing. The main goal of this paper is closely connected with the presentation of the continual work. The reason for detection of internal separations in tyre casing is to avoid usage of those tyres, which already contain some internal separation about which we know that it could propagate during the movement of vehicles. This is closely connected with occurrence of tyre destruction and the main purpose is to prevent of its critical status and later vehicle crash and human life menace...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{study of}} the {{microstructural}} influences on thermo-mechanical behavior of selected metals and ceramics using computer simulation, with original contributions in both theoretical and applied aspects. There are three major thrusts. First, by constructing a many-body empirical potential for ZrCx and then carrying out MD simulations to calculate its lattice thermal conductivity, I obtain the first quantitative evidence ever that the vibrational contribution is {{only a small part of}} the total thermal conductivity of refractory carbides at realistic carbon vacancy concentrations. This is a long-standing problem which even the most recent review article on the subject give what I now believe is the wrong estimate. Second, ideal strengths are calculated for Ar,Cu,SiC crystals using both lattice and molecular dynamics methods. A set of homogeneous instability criteria are derived. Tension tests are performed on amorphous and nanocrystalline SiC at room temperature, based on which a grain size cutoff of ~ 20 nm is extrapolated for the Hall-Petch effect. Nano-indentation is performed on single-crystal and nanocrystalline Cu, and bursts of dislocation loops is observed at a local stress level consistent with recent experiments on Cu thin films. Third, an invariant loop summation similar to the J-integral is derived for the driving force on defect motion, but with the loop size now down to nanometers, and the summation now expressed in terms of interatomic forces instead of stress, a field concept which is hard to use in atomistic calculations and becomes ill-defined when <b>defect</b> <b>separations</b> approach the nanometer scale. It is shown first that the change in a system's total Helmholtz free energy due to a defect's move can be approximated by a local quantity involving only scores of atoms immediately surrounding the defect. Then, perturbation expansion is used to evaluate this local invariant for defect translation using only the current configuration. This driving force measure is then tested on a) self-interstitial diffusion near free surface in [alpha]-iron, b) crack-tip extension near a void in Si, c) screw dislocation translation in Si, with convincing results down to literally r = 1 nm, at a fraction of the cost of a full relaxation or free energy calculation for the whole system. This means that defect mobility can now be characterized by a universal and invariant standard, computable from a tiny atomistic calculation without relying on elasticity formulas or image summations. The standard is then used to determine the true Peierls-Nabarro stress in Si-like materials. by Ju Li. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Nuclear Engineering, 2000.
