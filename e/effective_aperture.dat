2500|$|Phased-array {{interferometry}} or aperture synthesis techniques, {{using an}} array of separate dishes that are phased into a single <b>effective</b> <b>aperture,</b> are not typical for radar applications, although they are widely used in radio astronomy. [...] Because of the thinned array curse, such multiple aperture arrays, when used in transmitters, result in narrow beams {{at the expense of}} reducing the total power transmitted to the target.

2500|$|By contrast, {{the minimum}} {{aperture}} {{does not depend}} on the focal length– it is limited by how narrowly the aperture closes, not the lens design– and is instead generally chosen based on practicality: very small apertures have lower sharpness due to diffraction, while the added depth of field is not generally useful, and thus there is generally little benefit in using such apertures. Accordingly, DSLR lens typically have minimum aperture of 16, 22, or 32, while large format may go down to 64, as reflected in the name of Group f/64. Depth of field is a significant concern in macro photography, however, and there one sees smaller apertures. For example, the Canon MP-E 65mm can have <b>effective</b> <b>aperture</b> (due to magnification) as small as 96. [...] The pinhole optic for Lensbaby creative lenses has an aperture of just 177.|$|E
