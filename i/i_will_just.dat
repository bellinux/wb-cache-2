500|$|York manager McEwan {{compared}} Donaldson to Paulo Wanchope in September 2006, but following York's 2–0 away defeat against Oxford United {{later that}} month, McEwan criticised Donaldson's selfishness in attack, saying it cost them the match. In late 2006, Donaldson became {{subject of much}} transfer speculation. Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Mick McCarthy watched him in York's 1–0 home victory over Altrincham, in which he scored his 12th goal of the season, on 5 November 2006. He was also watched by Scottish Premier League club Hibernian. In response to this speculation, Donaldson said: [...] "I don't read too much into the speculation. I've heard it before and nothing has happened so <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>just</b> keep my head down and enjoy my football until a point comes when the manager or board come and tell me they have had an offer they want to consider".|$|E
500|$|After the UK release, Dickon Stainer, head of Universal Classics and Jazz, {{spoke of}} plans to {{publicise}} Faryl in the US, saying [...] "America {{is going to}} be key. Because of her history on the talent show there's already a great deal of interest in her. The demand is intense." [...] In April 2009, Smith travelled to Los Angeles to begin her promotion of Faryl in the US. She appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in early May as part of her promotional tour. Faryl was released in the US on 5 May. Smith said before the release that she did not expect it to sell as well {{as it did in the}} UK. She said that [...] "in the US it's a lot harder because I'm not as well-known. In the UK, a lot of people obviously watched 'Britain's Got Talent' and stuff, and that was like fresh in everyone's minds." [...] After the release, she was more optimistic, saying [...] "hen I performed in New York, it reminded me of the HMV signing in Kettering and there was quite a big queue so I think my album was well received." [...] Smith returned from the US in early May. Despite the contrary being said when she performed on the third series of Britain's Got Talent, Smith had no plans for a concert tour in 2009; she was quoted as saying that [...] "I'm too young and don't think I would be able to do a tour on my own". However, she did plan to return to the US during her summer holidays to again promote Faryl. She said that [...] "everyone in America was really nice and they do like classical music, but it is so difficult to make it over there ... They seem to like their own singers, but <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>just</b> keep trying my best". However, she instead took a short break from her music career in summer, before returning to the recording studio later in the year for Wonderland, her second album, which was released in November.|$|E
2500|$|Comey also {{testified that}} Ashcroft [...] "expressed himself in very strong terms." [...] Goldsmith testified that Ashcroft spoke {{at length about}} the legal issue. [...] "Attorney General Ashcroft… [...] a couple of minutes' speech {{in which he said}} that he…. shared the Justice department's concerns." [...] Although he was not present for the {{conversation}} between Gonzales and Ashcroft, FBI Director Bob Mueller testified, [...] "Ashcroft complained to Judge Gonzales about White House compartmentalization rules preventing Ashcroft from getting the advice he needed." [...] On July 24, 2007, Gonzales testified that he and Card were also concerned about Ashcroft's competency. [...] "Obviously there was concern about General Ashcroft's condition. [...] And we would not have sought nor did we intend to get any approval from General Ashcroft if in fact he wasn't fully competent to make the decision." [...] In response to a question from Senator Hatch, Gonzales continued, [...] "Obviously we were concerned about the condition of General Ashcroft. [...] We obviously knew he had been ill and had surgery. [...] And we never had any intent to ask anything of him if we did not feel that he was competent. [...] When we got there, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>just</b> say that Mr. Ashcroft did most of the talking. [...] We were there maybe five minutes – five to six minutes. [...] Mr. Ashcroft talked about the legal issues in a lucid form, as I've heard him talk about legal issues in the White House.|$|E

The marriage was opposed by Antipater II, Herod the Great's eldest son, and so Herod demoted Herod II to second {{in line to}} the throne. Antipater's execution in 4 B.C. for plotting to poison his father left Herod II as first in line, but his mother's knowledge of the poison plot, and failure to stop it, led to his being dropped from this position in Herod <b>I's</b> <b>will</b> <b>just</b> days before he died.|$|R
