Paul taught that, just as Christians share in Jesus' death in baptism, so they will share in his resurrection <b>for</b> <b>Jesus</b> was designated <b>the</b> <b>Son</b> of God by his resurrection. [...] Paul's views went against the thoughts of the Greek philosophers to whom a bodily resurrection meant a new imprisonment in a corporeal body, which was what they wanted to avoid, given that for them the corporeal and the material fettered the spirit. At the same time, Paul believed that the newly resurrected body would be a heavenly body—immortal, glorified, powerful and pneumatic, in contrast to an earthly body which is mortal, dishonored, weak and psychic.|$|R
