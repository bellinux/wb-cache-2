5|$|The {{prosperity}} of the stockyards was due to both the concentration of railroads {{and the evolution of}} refrigerated railroad cars. Its decline was due to further advances in post-World War II transportation and distribution. <b>Direct</b> <b>sales</b> of livestock from breeders to packers, facilitated by advancement in interstate trucking, made it cheaper to slaughter animals where they were raised and excluded the intermediary stockyards. At first, the major meatpacking companies resisted change, but Swift and Armour both surrendered and vacated their plants in the Yards in the 1950s.|$|E

The DVD includes the theatrical version of the film along with the option to add deleted scenes, and several new additional features.|$|E
5|$|When {{the project}} began, the Society had only eight hundred {{thousand}} taka in its coffers for the project.

Education Ministry funded about 74% of the cost, while 26% of the fund came mostly from universities and banks. Before <b>direct</b> <b>sales</b> started on 3 January 2003, 4,000 copies of the English version and all but 250 copies of the Bengali version were sold in advance out of the initial print of 5,000 copies for each versions.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to explore the differences of consumer characteristics and expenditures on local food between large scale stores and <b>direct</b> <b>sale</b> stores selling local food and to find some influencing factors on the expenditure on local food from both consumer groups. First, the levels of perceived attributes of local food were high for both consumer groups but were much higher for consumers from <b>direct</b> <b>sale</b> stores of local food. For food consumption patterns, consumers from <b>direct</b> <b>sale</b> stores presented higher levels than large scale stores and were found to be significantly different. Food choice motives were found to be significantly different in both groups. In addition, for the consumer characteristics, age and living with children under age 18 were found to be significantly different between both groups, while sex, education and household income were not. Second, expenditure of local food from <b>direct</b> <b>sale</b> stores was found to be significantly higher than large sale stores. Finally, expenditure of local food from large scale stores was found to be significantly influenced by age, price and seeking well-being, while expenditure of local food from <b>direct</b> <b>sale</b> stores was found to be significantly influenced by age, availability of local food, seeking cuisine, seeking satiety and sensory appeal.

25|$|Writers in a {{specialized}} field {{or with a}} narrower appeal have found smaller alternatives to the mass market {{in the form of}} small presses and self-publishing.

25|$|Under a buyback {{program called}} the Resale Value Guarantee {{available}} in 37 U.S. states, a Tesla Model S sold before July 1, 2016 included {{the right to}} return it after three years with reimbursement of 43% to 50% of its initial price. This reimbursement matched the trade-in values of competitive German luxury cars of that age.

According to Automotive News, the profit margin on used car sales in the U.S. is about triple that on new cars, and Tesla's <b>direct</b> <b>sales</b> would allow it capture resale profits.

25|$|The main {{criticism}} {{was that the}} temple was using fundraising methods that did not fit in with Buddhism. Examples that were pointed out were the fact that fundraising resembled <b>direct</b> <b>sales,</b> the distribution of amulets to donors as complementary gift {{and the use of}} modern technology. Scholars in Buddhism, such as Luang Por Payutto, social critic Sulak Sivaraksa, as well as two monks who formerly lived at the temple, all argued against the temple's fundraising methods. Moreover, some teachings of the temple were criticized: the idea that large donations yield greater fruits or merit, and the idea that Nibbana was the true self. (See § Principles, practices and beliefs) Although many of these methods and teachings were not unique to Wat Phra Dhammakaya, the criticism came at a moment when the temple had become very noticeable due to its size, its high-profile supporters, and due to the project of building the Cetiya, which required a lot of funds. And all of this at the backdrop of the financial crisis that Thailand was going through.|$|E

40|$|The {{dissertation}} aims {{to identify}} and investigate factors involved in <b>direct</b> <b>sale</b> in relation to Chinese culture. <b>Direct</b> <b>sale</b> is one form of direct marketing, which can include door-to-door, office-to-office, home party selling, etc. For a salesperson {{to be able to}} do business with people from various cultures, he/she needs to understand the differences in their values and in their consumer needs. Cultural values have implications for marketing communication and direct selling activities. After a literature review of the two areas, <b>direct</b> <b>sale</b> and Chinese culture a theoretical model was developed. This model will be helpful for companies when entering the Chinese market through <b>direct</b> <b>sale.</b> The model consists of twelve factors involved in direct sale; communication, commitment, trust, collective, friendship, empathy, respect, conflict avoidance, loyalty, functionality, behaviour, and home party. The aim is to show how important each of the factors is for direct selling in China. From the interpretations of the research review we came to the conclusion that all factors are considered to be of importance in relation to Chinese culture. In order to test the model we conducted a survey. Our population consisted of Chinese exchange students at Kristianstad University in Sweden. The result of the survey became the base of a new model. The new model showed that all factors were of importance but with different degrees. In order to see if our model might be useful in real life we chose to include a case study of Oriflame. All the factors in our model supported Oriflame’s strategy...|$|R
