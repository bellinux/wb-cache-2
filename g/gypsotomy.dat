30|$|Rotational {{deformity}} is {{a problem}} in children with femoral shaft fractures who are treated with closed reduction and spica casting [14, 15]. It can be determined clinically by inspection of the limb alignment, with evaluation of hip range of motion and observation of the gait of the child. In the study by Saseendar et al. [13], 43.75  % of children treated with spica casting had in-toe gait. In order to prevent this complication, malrotation has to be determined early in the course of treatment. Measuring the antetorsion angle by computed tomography and comparing it with the opposite side has been used to assess malrotation during follow-up [7, 8]. Bulut et al. [6] used computed tomography to follow children treated with spica casting. They corrected the fractures with a rotational deformity greater than 10 ° with a <b>gypsotomy</b> through the level of fracture. Close monitoring of fracture reduction is important {{to be able to make}} an early intervention such as <b>gypsotomy</b> or surgery in the case of malrotation. Using computed tomography for follow-up exposes the child to much radiation and is expensive. With our measurement technique, a direct roentgenogram could become the technique of choice in imaging studies for follow-up of rotational alignment of pediatric femoral shaft fractures.|$|E
