25|$|The {{launching}} {{of a conservative}} weekly journal of opinion in a country widely {{assumed to be a}} bastion of conservatism at first glance looks like a work of supererogation, rather like publishing a royalist weekly within the walls of Buckingham Palace. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> of course; if National Review is superfluous, it is so for very different reasons: It stands athwart history, yelling Stop, at a time when no other is inclined to do so, or to have much patience with those who so urge it.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis of {{elemental}} or inorganic mercury poisoning involves {{determining the}} history of exposure, physical findings, and an elevated body burden of mercury. Although whole-blood mercury concentrations are typically less than 6μg/L, diets rich in fish can result in blood mercury concentrations higher than 200μg/L; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> useful to measure these levels for suspected cases of elemental or inorganic poisoning because of mercury's short half-life in the blood. If the exposure is chronic, urine levels can be obtained; 24-hour collections are more reliable than spot collections. It is difficult or impossible to interpret urine samples of patients undergoing chelation therapy, as the therapy itself increases mercury levels in the samples.|$|E

25|$|Boas applied these {{principles}} to his studies of Inuit languages. Researchers have reported {{a variety of}} spellings for a given word. In the past, researchers have interpreted this data {{in a number of}} ways—it could indicate local variations in the pronunciation of a word, or it could indicate different dialects. Boas argues an alternative explanation: that the difference is not in how Inuit pronounce the word, but rather in how English-speaking scholars perceive the pronunciation of the word. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> English speakers are physically incapable of perceiving the sound in question; rather, the phonetic system of English cannot accommodate the perceived sound.|$|E
25|$|November has warm {{days and}} cool nights. Mid-November {{conditions}} are {{much like those}} of October. During the last weeks of November there is a gradual decrease in temperature and thus winter begins, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> cold. The first weeks of November are typically dry and {{the last week of}} November is cold. It is one of the driest months of the year, not only in Karachi, but most parts of Pakistan. On 9 November 2010 remnants of Cyclone Jal caused gusty winds in the metropolis. The highest rainfall for November is , which occurred in 1959. The highest and lowest temperatures are , recorded on 1 November 1994 and , recorded on 29 November 1938 respectively.|$|E
25|$|The least {{expensive}} models only detect and display {{a small number}} of pitches, often those pitches that are required to tune a given instrument (e.g., E, A, D, G, B, E of standard guitar tuning). While this type of tuner is useful for bands that only use stringed instruments such as guitar and electric bass, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> useful for tuning brass or woodwind instruments. Tuners at the next price point offer chromatic tuning, the ability to detect and assess all the pitches in the chromatic scale (e.g., C, C, D, D, etc.). Chromatic tuners can be used for B and E brass instruments, such as saxophones and horns. Many models have circuitry that automatically detects which pitch is being played, and then compares it against the correct pitch. Less expensive models require the musician to specify the target pitch via a switch or slider. Most low- and mid-priced electronic tuners only allow tuning to an equal temperament scale.|$|E

25|$|Crabbe's {{shift in}} {{approach}} {{was not necessarily}} a bad thing. The flaw in Crabbe's poetry, however, is, according to Hazlitt, that, with all its detail, it misses much of life, emphasising much too heavily the oppressive and the squalid, along with the mean and malicious tendencies of human nature. Hazlitt points to ways in which all this might be incorporated into literature and yet made uplifting, as in tragedy. With Crabbe, we get mostly the oppressive. In this, Hazlitt finds Crabbe unimaginative. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> he doesn't indulge in flights of fancy, but rather that he doesn't use his imagination to see, and help the reader see, into the minds and hearts of the poor, to feel what they feel in their situation. Instead, scrutinizing in detail the squalor of their surroundings, he attributes to them feelings he would have in their place.|$|E
25|$|To {{understand}} drum protocol, a drum may {{be thought}} of as a person or being and is to be regarded and respected as such. Drum etiquette is highly important. There are regional variations. The drum is the central symbol of Oklahoma pow wows and is located in the center of the dance floor and pow wow (which are themselves shaped in concentric circles). Southern drums are suspended by four posts, one for each direction. Northern drums are set up on the outside of the dance area, with the host drum in the best position. Drummer-singers are expected to remain at their drum and ready to sing at any moment's notice; a dancer might approach the drum and whistle, fan or gesture his staff over a drum to indicate his request for a song even if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> drum group's turn to sing. In some regions it is considered disrespectful to leave a drum completely unattended. Some drum groups do not allow females to sit down at their drum but welcome them to stand behind the drummers and sing backup harmonies; the reasons for this point vaguely to a variety of tribal stories that attempt to tell the history of drumming as each group understands it. People bring water to the drummers and generally assist the players as needed. (It is also considered a taboo among some nations to discuss spiritual teachings in writing or to name absolute authority in reference to spiritual teachings.) The drum is offered gifts of tobacco during giveaways and musicians acknowledge this by standing.|$|E

500|$|Kierkegaard’s {{discourse}} {{has to do}} {{with the}} difference between wishing and willing in the development of a particular expectancy. [...] "As thought becomes more absorbed in the future, it loses its way in its restless attempt to force or entice an explanation from the riddle." [...] Expectancy always looks to the future and can hope, but regret, which is what Goethe did in his book The Sorrows of Young Werther, closes the door of hope and love becomes unhappy. Kierkegaard points to [...] "faith as the highest" [...] expectancy because faith is something that everyone has, or can have. He says: [...] "The person who wishes it for another person wishes it for himself; the person who wishes it for himself wishes it for every other human being, because that by which another person has faith is not that by which he is different from him but is that by which he is like him; that by which he possesses <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> by which he is different from others but that by which he is altogether like all." ...|$|E
500|$|Zinta {{has been}} the subject of several controversies. In 2003, as a witness in the Bharat Shah case, she testified against the Indian mafia. Bharat Shah, the financer of one of her films, Chori Chori Chupke Chupke, was arrested in 2000 for having {{connections}} with Chhota Shakeel, a Mumbai underworld boss. Unlike several of her colleagues, Zinta repeated in court her earlier statement that she had received extortion threats from the mafia during the shooting of the film. After her testimony, she was given witness protection and was forced to stay out of the public eye for two months. Thirteen other witnesses before her, including celebrities Salman Khan and Shahrukh Khan, were witnesses in the case but later retracted their earlier statements. Zinta was the only witness who did not become hostile to the prosecution; the nation responded positively to her actions. Consequently, she was the first recipient of Godfrey's Mind of Steel Award at the annual Red and White Bravery Awards, given to her for the [...] "courageous act" [...] of standing against the Mumbai Underworld. On receiving the award, she said, [...] "To be brave is not to be fearless. It is when you fear and you get over it, then you can be called brave. I am human. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> I fear nothing. But getting over a fear is a continuous process and I have been successful so far."
