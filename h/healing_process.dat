Later Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) informs Meredith that Lou underwent surgery and was discharged. He's asked to see her to apologize, but Meredith refuses. Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) helps her prepare for a visit with her children. On arriving they are terrified when they see their mother in that condition and leave. Meredith has a panic attack, and Penny steps up to help, removing the wires holding her jaw shut. Jackson reprimands Penny for jeopardising the <b>healing</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E

5|$|Pleurodesis is a {{procedure}} that permanently eliminates the pleural space and attaches the lung to the chest wall. No long-term study (20 years or more) has been performed on its consequences. Good results {{in the short term}} are achieved with a thoracotomy (surgical opening of the chest) with identification of any source of air leakage and stapling of blebs followed by pleurectomy (stripping of the pleural lining) of the outer pleural layer and pleural abrasion (scraping of the pleura) of the inner layer. During the <b>healing</b> <b>process,</b> the lung adheres to the chest wall, effectively obliterating the pleural space. Recurrence rates are approximately 1%. Post-thoracotomy pain is relatively common.|$|E
5|$|The {{relevance}} of primary implant stability decreases gradually with regrowth of bone tissue around the implant {{in the first}} weeks after surgery, leading to secondary stability. Secondary stability {{is different from the}} initial stabilization, because it results from the ongoing process of bone regrowth into the implant (osseointegration). When this <b>healing</b> <b>process</b> is complete, the initial mechanical stability becomes biological stability. Primary stability is critical to implantation success until bone regrowth maximizes mechanical and biological support of the implant. Regrowth usually occurs during the 3–4 weeks after implantation. Insufficient primary stability, or high initial implant mobility, can lead to failure.|$|E
5|$|Hemingway's stories {{typically}} position {{nature as}} a source of refuge and rebirth. His characters are often shown retreating to the country in search of regeneration. Nature acts as the setting for hunters' or fishermen's existential moment of transcendence—especially at the moment when prey is killed. In Big Two-Hearted River, Nick walks away from a ruined town, and enters the woods to hike toward the river, unharmed by the fire. His journey is motivated by absolution; the river is described as two-hearted because it gives life in the form of food (fish) and offers redemption. In the woods, Nick stops in a grove of trees that is described as chapel-like, a description that echoes Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage in which Henry Fleming flees to a chapel-like grove of trees. In the grove Nick sleeps well {{for the first time since}} the war, and there he begins the <b>healing</b> <b>process.</b> The next morning he goes to the river, wading into the water to fish. At first the strength of the current frightens him, and for some moments he has difficulty controlling himself.|$|E

40|$|The {{optimization}} of <b>healing</b> <b>processes</b> in a {{wide range}} of tissues represents a central point for surgical research. One approach is to stimulate <b>healing</b> <b>processes</b> with growth factors. These substances have a short half-life and therefore it seems useful to administer these substances locally rather than systemically. One possible method of local delivery is to incorporate growth factors into a bioabsorbable poly (D, L-lactide) suspension (PDLLA) and coat suture material. The aim of the present study was to establish a procedure for the local delivery of growth factors using coated suture material. Sutures coated with growth factors were tested in an animal model. Anastomoses of the colon were created in a rat model using monofilament sutures. These were either untreated or coated with PDLLA coating alone or coated with PDLLA incorporating insulin—like growth factor-I (IGF-I). The anastomoses were subjected to biomechanical, histological, and immunohistochemical examination. After 3 days the treated groups showed a significantly greater capacity to withstand biomechanical stress than the control groups. This finding was supported by the results of the histomorphometric. The results of the study indicate that it is possible to deliver bioactive growth factors locally using PDLLA coated suture material. <b>Healing</b> <b>processes</b> can thus be stimulated locally without subjecting the whole organism to potentially damaging high systemic doses...|$|R
5|$|Meluha is a near perfect empire, created {{many centuries}} earlier by Lord Ram, {{one of the}} {{greatest}} kings that ever lived. However, the once proud empire and its Suryavanshi rulers face severe crisis as its primary river, the revered Saraswati, is slowly drying to extinction. They also face devastating terrorist attacks from the east, the land of the Chandravanshis who have joined forces with the Nagas, a cursed race with physical deformities. The present king of Meluha, Daksha, sends his emissaries to North India in Tibet, to invite the tribes that live there to Meluha. One of those invited are the Gunas, whose chief Shiva is a brave warrior and protector. Shiva accepts the proposal and moves to Meluha with his tribe. They reach the city of Srinagar and are received there by Ayurvati, the Chief of Medicine of the Meluhans. Shiva and his tribe are impressed with the Meluhan way of life. On their first night of stay at Srinagar, the Gunas wake up amid high fever and sweating. The Meluhans, under Ayurvati's orders, carry on the <b>healing</b> <b>process.</b> However, Ayurvati finds out that Shiva is the only one devoid of these symptoms and that his throat has turned blue.

The spiritual mediator is {{a departure from the}} rest in that its potential for empirical investigation is not currently feasible. Although the conceptualizations of chi, the universal mind, divine intervention, and the like breach the boundaries of scientific observation, they are included in this model as possible links between prayer and health so as to not unnecessarily exclude the supernatural from the broader conversation of psychology and religion.

40|$|International audienceTendon is a {{uniaxial}} {{connective tissue}} {{component of the}} musculoskeletal system. Tendon is involved in force transmission between muscle and bone. Tendon injury is very common and debilitating but tendon repair remains a clinical challenge for orthopedic medicine. In vertebrates, tendon is mainly composed of type I collagen fibrils, displaying a parallel organization along the tendon axis. The tendon-specific spatial organization of type I collagen provides the mechanical properties for tendon function. In contrast to other components of the musculoskeletal system, tendon biology is poorly understood. An important goal in tendon biology is to understand the mechanisms involved in the production and assembly of type I collagen fibrils during development, postnatal formation, and <b>healing</b> <b>processes</b> in order to design new therapies for tendon repair. In this review we highlight the current understanding of the molecular and mechanical signals known {{to be involved in}} tenogenesis during development, and how development provides insights into tendon <b>healing</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R

40|$|To {{clarify the}} phathophysiological role of {{macrophage}} colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) in the <b>healing</b> <b>processes</b> of inflammation, we studied chronological changes in serum concentrations of M-CSF and other reactants during the acute phase of inflammation {{in patients who}} underwent open heart surgery, since these patients showed a precise point of tissue damage. The number of neutrophilic leukocytes increased {{in the very early}} postoperative stage, reached a peak 48 h after surgery and declined to the basal level at day 14. The chronological changes in serum C-reactive protein level after surgery were similar to these of neutrophic leukocytes. Serum M-CSF concentrations increased gradually, reached a peak 7 days after surgery and remained at that level until day 14. Based on these phenomena, it is assumed that M-CSF plays a pathophysiological role in the <b>healing</b> <b>processes</b> of an inflammation. Measurement of the serum concentration of M-CSF would be useful for evaluating the process of inflammation...|$|R
40|$|The <b>healing</b> <b>processes</b> of {{deciduous}} tooth socket after extraction {{seems to}} have some influence on the growth of permanent teeth. As for the studies on <b>healing</b> <b>processes</b> of extraction wound of teeth, there are many reports by Euler (1932), Hahn (1958), Smith (1958), and Tomozawa (1973), {{but as far as}} we know, there is no report dealing with deciduous teeth. For this reason, using pups (about 3 months old, weighing 1. 5 Kg- 3. 0 Kg, about the same solidification of eruption of deciduous teeth and calcification of permanent teeth germ) the first and second frontal teeth of upper jaw of the right and left sides, and the first and third frontal teeth on the right and left sides were extracted. Then exfoliative cytological, pathohistological as well as macroscopic observations were carried out on the <b>healing</b> <b>processes</b> of the extraction wound with lapse of time, and the following results were obtained. It was found that 15 days after tooth extraction the maturity of epithelial cells became quite marked, and by 30 postoperative days exfoliated cells gave the findings similar to those of normal gingiva. The proliferation of the subepithelial connective tissue was marked by 5 - 10 postoperative days. After 20 days and later the exfoliative cytological findings revealed an acute {{increase in the number of}} precornified cells, and the pathohistological findings showed a tendency of parakeratosis.
