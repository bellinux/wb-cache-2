5|$|In July 2013, {{the station}} owners {{sent a letter}} of concern to the state, seeking that the Environmental Impact Report for the museum and <b>footbridge</b> {{consider}} a breadth of possible impacts, particularly from the <b>footbridge.</b> The museum itself received a Finding Of No Significant Impact in March 2014. The Environmental Impact Evaluation for the <b>footbridge,</b> released in July 2014, analyzed seven alternatives for the <b>footbridge</b> location. Alternative 5a, located east of the baggage building and including a section to the garage, was the preferred alternative. The state committed $20 million towards {{the cost of the}} potential <b>footbridge.</b>|$|E
5|$|On June 8, 1999, a {{tractor-trailer}} {{carrying a}} backhoe that exceeded the maximum height requirement struck a pedestrian <b>footbridge</b> over the Baltimore Beltway just {{northwest of the}} I-95 junction near Arbutus. The <b>footbridge</b> collapsed onto the inner loop of the Beltway. One driver was killed when his SUV struck the collapsed bridge; six others were injured, three critically. The incident occurred during the afternoon rush hour. The <b>footbridge</b> had been closed to pedestrians since November 1996 due to complaints about vandalism and crime.|$|E
5|$|A <b>footbridge</b> is {{incorporated}} {{on the eastern}} side and pedestrians, cyclists and motorcycles can cross the estuary {{by the side of the}} track. Since 1996, this has formed part of the National Cycle Route that links North and South Wales. The <b>footbridge</b> is owned by Network Rail but an agreement is in place with Gwynedd County Council, who pay for 10% of the annual maintenance in exchange for a licence to use the bridge.|$|E

25|$|The 191st Street {{station has}} two tracks and two side platforms. There are also covered {{pedestrian}} <b>footbridges</b> connecting the two platforms, so {{people on the}} <b>footbridges</b> cannot see the tracks and platforms (and vice versa).|$|R

5|$|Around 1912, New London {{citizens}} successfully {{petitioned the}} Public Utilities Commission for {{the installation of}} a <b>footbridge</b> connecting the station to the ferry docks {{in order to improve}} pedestrian safety. At the time, with no bridge crossing the river below Norwich, the ferries were heavily used. The <b>footbridge,</b> constructed of steel with a canopy to keep out rain, was constructed soon after.|$|E

5|$|The {{railway station}} would be {{developed}} into an 'interchange' with local buses and trains. The upgrade {{would provide a}} new platform, <b>footbridge</b> and new station buildings. Outside the station a new road bridge from Midland Road over the railway line is also planned with a new <b>footbridge</b> to reach the new development. Other plans to include {{the development of the}} High Street, Shelley Road and the north of the town areas are also being considered.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the paper}} a brief {{characteristic}} of vibration comfort criteria requirements for <b>footbridges</b> according to EN 1990 /A 1 and their comparison with recommendations of different authors and guidelines have been presented. Moreover, {{the requirements of}} ISO 10137 standard and Flaga & Pańtak propositions of vibration comfort criteria have been shown and characterized. Furthermore, examples of dynamic analysis of several steel <b>footbridges</b> and assessment of the vibration comfort criteria for the <b>footbridges</b> have been presented...|$|R
40|$|In {{structural}} design {{there is a}} tendency towards more slender and challenging architectural structures. <b>Footbridges</b> become more slender with an increasing high ratio live load to dead weight. A consequence of this increased slenderness of <b>footbridges</b> in an increased susceptibility to human-induced vibrations. The evaluation of the serviceability of <b>footbridges</b> therefore becomes more important. The first aim {{of this study was to}} provide a good basis and overview of the critical aspects in the evaluation of human-induced vibrations in <b>footbridges.</b> From a literature study, the discussions with engineering companies and an impact study it became clear that there are four critical aspects particularly relevant for further study at the moment: vandal loading, structural damping,additional mass and damping by pedestrians and probability of occurrence of accelerations and the consequences for comfort of the pedestrians. The second part of this study was focused on the question whether a probability-based approach can demonstrate that the Eurocode is conservative in the evaluation of human-induced vibrations in <b>footbridges.</b> Hereto, a probability-based analysis has been performed for the vibration serviceability of <b>footbridges</b> and implemented in a case study with three simply supported <b>footbridges.</b> Instead of looking at the maximum acceleration that is expected for the bridge deck, the accelerations which individual pedestrians experience when crossing the bridge have been investigated. Four scenarios have been compared to the approach prescribed by the Eurocode. The pedestrian loading has been modeled based on two assumptions for the scenarios: scenarios based on densities of the pedestrian ?ow and scenarios based on group formation. The conducted research based on assumptions for the pedestrian traf?c and a ?xed criterion for human comfort, has given valuable insight in the use of a more realistic evaluation of human-induced vibrations in <b>footbridges.</b> This insight has been obtained for the incoming pedestrian traf?c and the exposure to vibrations for individual pedestrians. The adopted probability-based approach contributes to demonstrate potential conservatism in the Eurocode regarding the evaluation of human-induced vibrations in <b>footbridges.</b> Structural MechanicsStructural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
5|$|Facilities at {{the station}} are minimal– shelters, benches and {{timetable}} information are provided. Customer help points give live train information. There is no ticket office, and no self-service ticket machines {{which can be used}} to buy or collect tickets. The station car park is {{to the north of the}} platforms, with 40 spaces. There is step-free access to the northern platform from the car park, and a set of steps from the <b>footbridge.</b> There is also stepped access to the <b>footbridge</b> from the south, and a ramp down to the southern platform. There is no taxi rank, but there are bus stops on Whiteladies Road. Cycle storage is available on the platform.|$|E
5|$|Further along {{from the}} Welsh Bridge is the Porthill Bridge, a {{pedestrian}} suspension bridge running between the Quarry and Porthill, built in 1922. The next bridge {{along the river}} is Kingsland Bridge, a privately owned toll bridge, and the subsequent bridge is the Greyfriars Bridge, a pedestrian bridge between Coleham and the town centre. Following the Greyfriars Bridge is the English Bridge, historically called Stone Bridge, which was rebuilt in the 1930s. Beyond it is the railway station, which is partly built over the river. After the station is Castle Walk <b>Footbridge,</b> another modern pedestrian <b>footbridge.</b>|$|E

5|$|To {{link the}} new {{developments}} around Battersea Power Station to Battersea Park, in 2004 a new curved <b>footbridge</b> was built beneath {{the southern end}} of Chelsea Bridge. The <b>footbridge</b> was built offsite in four sections, transported by road to the King George V Dock where it was assembled, and the completed structure floated down the river and hoisted into position. It is planned that once the riverfront in the area has been opened to the public, following the completion of the rebuilding of Battersea Power Station into a commercial development, the new bridge will form part of the Thames Path. The new bridge curves out from the bank, overhanging the river bank by , and cost £600,000 to build.|$|E

5|$|At {{the other}} end of the river, the Millennium Bridge was opened in 2001. There was once a ferry at this point, before 1865, which gave access to the Victoria Dock, opened in 1850. South Bridge {{replaced}} the ferry in 1865, making it easier for workers to reach the dock. The swing <b>footbridge</b> was closed in 1934, but was not demolished until 1944.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan {{recommended}} constructing a greenway and connecting trail along Roaring Brook.

A proposed pedestrian loop trail would have a <b>footbridge</b> over the stream.|$|E
