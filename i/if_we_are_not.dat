2500|$|The mood of Arnold's poetry {{tends to}} be of plaintive reflection, and he is {{restrained}} in expressing emotion. He felt that poetry should be the 'criticism of life' and express a philosophy. Arnold's philosophy is that true happiness comes from within, and that people should seek within themselves for good, while being resigned in acceptance of outward things and avoiding the pointless turmoil of the world. However, he argues {{that we should not}} live in the belief that we shall one day inherit eternal bliss. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> happy on earth, we should moderate our desires rather than live in dreams of something that may never be attained.

2500|$|As Nokia was {{the largest}} mobile phone and {{smartphone}} manufacturer worldwide at the time, it was suggested the alliance would help Windows Phone, but {{from the beginning of}} 2011, until 2013, Nokia fell from #1 to #10 in smartphone sales. In June 2011, Nokia was overtaken by Apple as the world's biggest smartphone maker by volume. In Q2 2011, amid falling sales, Nokia posted a loss of €368 million, after having realized a profit of €227 million in Q2 2010. In September 2011, Nokia announced it would cut another 3,500 jobs worldwide, including the closure of its Cluj factory in Romania, after having cut as many as 7,000 the previous April. In August 2011 Chris Weber, head of Nokia's subsidiary in the U.S., stated that [...] "The reality is <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> successful with Windows Phone, it doesn't matter what we do [...] He further added, North America is a priority for Nokia [...] because it is a key market for Microsoft.

2500|$|Grant {{had placed}} {{much of the}} blame on General Wallace, whom he had sent verbal orders to bring his troops forward, accusing Wallace of failure in {{following}} those orders, which he believed resulted in the delay in moving up reserves, nearly costing the Union the loss of the battle. After hearing reports that Wallace refused to obey anything but written orders, an angry General Grant asserted that a division general ought to take his troops to wherever the firing may be, even without orders", and first sent Colonel William R. Rowley, ordering him to [...] "tell him to come up at once" [...] and that [...] "if he should require a written order of you, you will give it to him at once". When Rowley caught up to where Wallace's division last was, there was only a supply wagon departing the scene. Riding on further Rowley found Wallace at the head of his column near Clear Creek, positioned on high ground. Rowley pulled Wallace off to the side and warned him of the danger that lied just ahead, exclaiming, [...] "Don't you know that Sherman has been driven back? Why, the whole army is within half a mile of the river, and it's a question <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> all going to be driven into it." [...] Wallace, stunned by the news, sent his cavalry ahead to assess the situation, and upon returning, it had confirmed Rowley's claim.|$|E

[...] Rowley replied, [...] "Yes, he wants you at Pittsburg Landingand he wants you there like hell." [...] Wallace, stunned by the news, said that was the second such message he received and immediately sent his cavalry ahead to assess the situation. Upon their return they had confirmed Rowley's claim. Later, in his Autobiography, Wallace wrote about his encounter with Rowley, how he realized he was {{at the rear of the}} entire Confederate army, and how he was stunned by the news. Rowley and Lieutenant Colonel Douglas Putnam later corroborated Grant's account of the event when Grant was being criticized for the heavy losses involved in the battle. In the aftermath of the costly battle, rumors also emerged that Grant was delayed at Savannah because he had been drinking.|$|E

2500|$|Later that day, Bethmann Hollweg sent {{a message}} to the German {{ambassador}} to Vienna increasing pressure to accept the halt-in-Belgrade proposal, saying that: [...] "If Vienna... refuses... to give way at all, it will hardly be possible to place the blame on Russia for the outbreak of the European conflagration. H.M. has, on the request of the Tsar, undertaken to intervene in Vienna because he could not refuse without awakening an irrefutable suspicion that we wanted war... If these efforts of Britain's meet with success, while Vienna refuses everything, Vienna will prove that it is set on having a war, into which we are dragged, while Russia remains free of guilt. This puts us in a quite impossible position in the eyes of our own people. We can therefore only urgently recommend Vienna to accept Grey's proposal, which safeguards its position in every way." [...] Bethmann Hollweg could not go to war in support of Austrian intransigence under such circumstances. But shortly afterwards, [...] "as soon as news of Russia's general mobilization began to arrive in Berlin" [...] the Chancellor instructed the ambassador in Vienna [...] "that all mediation attempts be stopped", and the directive be suspended. Fritz Fischer and some other scholars have maintained the alternative view that Prince Henry's assurances that King George had promised him that Britain would remain neutral accounted for the change. Fischer notes the telegram reporting these [...] "vague" [...] assurances arrived 12 minutes before the dispatch of the suspending telegram and that Bethmann Hollweg himself justified the cancellation that way, while acknowledging that before then Bethmann Hollweg had already prepared, but not yet sent, a telegram to Vienna explaining that he had [...] "cancelled execution of instructions in No. 200, because the General Staff has just informed me that military measures of our neighbors, especially in the east, compel speedy decision <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> to be taken by surprise".|$|E
