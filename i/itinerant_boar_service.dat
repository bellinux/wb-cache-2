40|$|Artisan pig {{family farms}} are an {{important}} mean of income, {{in spite of their}} poor performance they represent a small capital fund that can be used when faced with urgent cash flow situations, or to face immediate family feeding needs. <b>Boar</b> <b>service</b> rental in urban and rural areas is still common, this consists of renting boars for breeding in exchange of cash or in species. The objective {{of the present study was}} to carry out a retrospective analysis of the records of 63 boars, in order to characterize the frequency of use, age, preferred breed by the public of the region, and distances walked and traveled by the <b>boars</b> in <b>service</b> in the Chinampa region of Xochimilco, Mexico City. An average of 0. 19 to 0. 27 mountings per day was observed which corresponds to 1. 36 and 1. 92 mountings per week. Boars had short intervals between mountings, one or two days, or else carried out one mounting per year, registering an average of 15. 94 days between breedings. Boars older than twelve months had the highest number of mountings, more than 50, and were used only for one year. Surprisingly, males staying for 3 to 4 years, were not the ones that registered more mating activity since these pigs could not overcome an average of 40 mountings during their 4 years staying at the farm. Distances walked by <b>boars</b> during <b>service,</b> varied from 0. 5 km in the Chinampa region, to 25 km in urban areas. The results obtained in this study indicate that the reproductive efficiency in backyard swine breeding can not be established due to the lack of an appropriate reproductive program. It is necessary to consider hygiene and health measures in all the boars, since the increase in annual number of mountings could also rise the risk of venereal diseases during contact with females from different origin and unknown hygiene habits...|$|R

Characterization of movement networks between pig farms and through other types of farm and household enterprises that are involved in pig value chains can provide useful information on the role that different participants in the networks play in pathogen transmission. Analysis of social networks that underpin these pig movements can reveal pathways that are important in the transmission of disease, trade in commodities, the dissemination of information and the influence of behavioural norms. We assessed pig movements among pig keeping households within West Kenya and East Uganda and across the shared Kenya-Uganda border in the study region, to gain insight into within-country and trans-boundary pig movements. Villages were sampled using a randomized cluster design. Data were collected through interviews in 2012 and 2013 from 683 smallholder pig-keeping households in 34 villages. NodeXL software was used to describe pig movement networks at village level. The pig movement and trade networks were localized and based on close social networks involving family ties, friendships and relationships with neighbours. Pig movement network modularity ranged from 0. 2 – 0. 5 and exhibited good community structure within the network implying an easy flow of knowledge and adoption of new attitudes and beliefs, but also promoting an enhanced rate of disease transmission. The average path length of 5 defined using NodeXL, indicated that disease could easily reach every node in a cluster. Cross-border <b>boar</b> <b>service</b> between Uganda and Kenya was also recorded. Unmonitored trade in both directions was prevalent. While most pig transactions in the absence of disease, were at a small scale (10 km. The close social relationships between actors in pig movement networks indicate the potential for possible interventions to develop shared norms and mutually accepted protocols amongst smallholder pig keepers to better manage the risk of ASF introduction and transmission.

40|$|Abstract – The {{chromosomal}} {{control of}} pig populations {{has been widely}} developed in France over the last ten years. By December 31 st, 2006, 13 765 individuals had been karyotyped in our laboratory, 62 % of these since 2002. Ninety percent were young purebred <b>boars</b> controlled be-fore <b>service</b> in artificial insemination centres, and 3 % were hypoprolific boars. So far, 102 con-stitutional structural chromosomal rearrangements (67 since 2002) have been described. Fifty-six were reciprocal translocations and 8 peri- or paracentric inversions. For {{the first time since}} the beginning of the programme and after more than 11 000 pigs had been karyotyped, one Robertsonian translocation was identified in 2005 and two others in 2006. The estimated preva-lence of balanced structural chromosomal rearrangements in a sample of more than 7700 young <b>boars</b> controlled before <b>service</b> was 0. 47 %. Twenty-one of the 67 rearrangements described since 2002 were identified in hypoprolific boars. All were reciprocal translocations. Twelve mosaics (XX/XY in 11 individuals, XY/XXY in one individual) were also diagnosed. Two cor-responded to hypoprolific boars, and three to intersexed animals. The results presented in this communication would justify an intensification of the chromosomal control of French and, on a broader scale, European and North-American pig populations...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to present}} further information {{on the effects of}} boars' seminal plasma on sperm motility and female genitals, while paying particular attention to the boars' characteristics. On this occasion the seminal plasma was tested with regard to practical applicability as an additive to boar semen diluents in liquid form. The first series of tests served to analyse the effect of seminal plasma exchange among ejaculates of two boars on the sperm motility in vitro and mating ability in vivo. The effects on sperm motility were examined in a thermostability test. Furthermore, gilts were inseminated with sperm of either a good or a bad <b>service</b> <b>boar</b> with an additive of homologous or heterologous seminal plasma in the diluent. Success of fertility was determined by the number of recovered ova and embryos. In the course of the test, faeces were taken from the gilts to determine the P 4 - progesteronecontent. That was carried out to observe reactions of gilts to the application of seminal plasma from good or bad <b>service</b> <b>boars</b> and of ovulation synchronisation. The objective of the second series of tests was to characterize the effect of a determinate part of seminal plasma in the fluid-preserved semen of boars on sperm motility and fertilisation results, whereby boar specificity was also considered. Ejaculates from five boars were used in the preliminary test for this, having first been treated with diluents containing 0 %, 10 %, 20 % or 40 % seminal plasma. In field trials 196 sows were inseminated with semen, which had been preserved with diluents containing either some 40 % or no seminal plasma. In {{the first part of the}} trial we additionally used seminal plasma from nine sires, which were good <b>service</b> <b>boars</b> in practice. In the second part we used seminal plasma from only one boar, whose seminal plasma in previous experiments had shown a constant stimulating effect on the motility of foreign sperm. We subsequently obtained the following results: Homologous and heterologous seminal plasma can have different effects on the portion of movable sperms. Seminal plasma from ejaculates with a high sperm motility enhanced the motility of foreign sperms and was superior to diluents containing no seminal plasma with regard to the effect on activity of movement by sperm cells. Inseminations of gilts with the sperm of both good and poor <b>service</b> <b>boars,</b> which had been preserved with diluents, which contained 30 % seminal plasma of a good <b>service</b> <b>boar,</b> resulted in high conception rates (70, 1 (31, 3) %or rather 77, 7 (19, 6) %). When seminal plasma from a poor <b>service</b> <b>boar</b> was used as an additive for diluents, only inseminations with such preserved homologous sperms obtained similar high conception rates (82, 9 (29, 2) %). The conception rate of sows, which were inseminated with preserved homologous sperms through the above mentioned mix of seminal plasma and diluent, was only 53, 0 (34, 7) %. Differences have not been proved by statistics (-> = 0, 05). These insemination attempts shared that with P 4 - progesterone-determination in faeces, it is possible to obtain information about the cycle activity of sows and to check the activity of corpus luteum. No connexion was found between the application of seminal plasma from good and poor <b>service</b> <b>boars</b> and the excretion of progesterone through faeces. In laboratory experiments the additive of seminal plasma to diluent showed a positive effect on sperm motility when stored for 72 hours. In these studies no significant differences were found between the various seminal plasma portions in diluent (10 %, 20 %, 40 %). When ejaculates from routine sperm production were used, a generally stimulating effect of seminal plasma additives to diluent (seminal plasma 40 %) on sperm motility could only be shown during a storage period of about 24 hours. Only the seminal plasma of a determinate boar which clearly and constantly stimulated sperm motility had a significantly positive effect after 72 hours. The insemination of adult sows with semen, which had been preserved with diluents containing either some or no seminal plasma achieved good results as regards farrowing rates (experimental ratio 1 : 88, 3 % or rather 85, 7 %; experimental ratio 2 : 90, 5 % or rather 85, 7 %), piglet indices (experimental ratio 1 : 838, 6 or rather 762, 7; experimental ratio 2 : 760, 2 or rather 771, 3) and product of the farrowing rate and the size of the litter (experimental ratio 1 : 856, 5 or rather 797, 0; experimental ratio 2 : 760, 2 or rather 814, 2). There are no significant differences. Tendentiously positive effect of a seminal plasma additive to diluent were only seen in the size of litter (+ 1, 1) in the experimental ratio 2. </ul...|$|R

Based on the results of previous studies, using Analytical Network Process (ANP), the chosen model for the handling of waste is individual models on a scale of RT/RW. In order to implement this model required an appropriate institutional because it involves community participation as the key to success. By using Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) showed that the treatment of urban waste must be oriented on raising awareness of the public to maintain cleanliness and environmental health through the concept of 3 R (reduce, reuse and recycle).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate genetic parameters for litter size of Black Slavonian pigs using the repeatability, multiple trait, and random regression models, and to consider the possibility to increase litter size in Black Slavonian pigs by selection. A total of 4733 litter records from the first to the sixth parity from sows that farrowed between January 1998 and December 2010 were included in the analysis. Individual record consisted of the following variables: breeding organisation (eight regions), parity (1 - 6), <b>service</b> <b>boar,</b> and farrowing season (month-year interaction). Estimation of all the covariance components with three different models was based on the residual maximum likelihood method. Estimate of additive genetic variance and heritability for number of piglets born alive with repeatability model was 0. 23 and 0. 10, respectively. Estimates of additive genetic variance with multiple trait and random regression model were in a wider range from 0. 05 to 0. 65 across parities, and heritabilities were estimated in the range between 0. 03 and 0. 26. Estimates of phenotypic and additive genetic correlations were much smoother with random regression model in comparison with multiple trait model. Due to unexpected changes of variances along trajectory obtained with multiple trait and random regression model, the best option for genetic evaluation of litter size for now could be the use of repeatability model. With increasing number of data with proper data structure alternative modelling of litter size of Black Slavonian pig using multiple trait and random regression model could be taken into consideration...|$|R
50|$|The story {{takes place}} in the year 1468. The age of feudalism and chivalry was passing away, and the King of France was inciting the wealthy {{citizens}} of Flanders against his own rebellious vassal the Duke of Burgundy. Quentin Durward had come to Tours, where his uncle was one of the Scottish body guard maintained by Louis XI, to seek military service, and was invited by the king, disguised as a merchant, to breakfast at the inn, and supplied by him with money. Having narrowly escaped being hanged by the provost-marshal for cutting down Zamet, whom he found suspended from a tree, he was enlisted by Lord Crawford, and learned the history of Jacqueline. In the presence-chamber he was recognised by Louis, and the royal party were preparing for a hunting excursion, when the Count of Crèvecœur arrived with a peremptory demand for the instant surrender of the duke's ward, the Countess of Croye, who had fled from Burgundy with her aunt to escape a forced marriage; and proclaimed that his master renounced his allegiance to the crown of France. In the chase which followed Durward saved the king's life from a <b>boar,</b> for which <b>service</b> Louis, after consulting with his barber, entrusted him with the duty of conducting the Countess and Lady Hameline, ostensibly to the protection of the Bishop of Liege, but really that they might {{fall into the hands of}} William de la Marck. After proceeding some distance they were overtaken by Dunois and the Duke of Orléans, who would have seized the countess, but were prevented by Lord Crawford, who arrived in pursuit and made prisoners of them. Then Hayraddin came riding after them, and under his guidance they journeyed for nearly a week, when Quentin discovered that the Bohemian was in league with De la Marck. He accordingly altered their route, and they reached the bishop's castle in safety.|$|R
