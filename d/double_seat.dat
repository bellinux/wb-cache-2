2500|$|Eleven gaily-colored parachutes {{operated}} {{from the}} top of a 250-foot tower, enable visitors to experience all the thrills of [...] "bailing out" [...] without the hazard or discomfort. Each parachute has a <b>double</b> <b>seat</b> suspended from it. When two passengers have taken their places beneath the 'chute, a cable pulls it to the summit of the tower. An automatic release starts the drop, and the passengers float gently to the ground. Vertical guide wires prevent swaying, a metal ring keeps the 'chute open at all times, and shock-absorbers eliminate the impact of the landing. One of the most spectacular features of the Amusement Area, this is also a type of parachute jump similar to that which the armies of the world use in early stages of training for actual parachute jumping.|$|E
2500|$|L’Express Flight 508 was {{operated}} with a Beech C99 twin-engine turboprop aircraft. Seating on {{the plane}} was five rows of two seats, {{one on each side}} of a central aisle. A single seat was located across from the left passenger loading door and a <b>double</b> <b>seat</b> {{at the rear of the}} aircraft. Passengers boarded through the rear passenger door. The flight left New Orleans, LA with one passenger, at 4:05 pm CDT, landing in Mobile, AL, at 4:50 pm CDT. After changing crews and boarding 12 passengers, the flight departed for Birmingham Municipal Airport at 5:05 pm CDT. As the flight approached Birmingham, strong thunderstorms developed in the vicinity of the airport. Around the same time four other aircraft either diverted to other airports or delayed their approach and entered a holding pattern until the weather improved. The crew of Flight 508 was aware of the thunderstorm activity but elected to continue the approach. Francis Fernandes, the L'Express captain at the controls of Flight 508, later said the plane experienced a [...] "significant roll to the left" [...] on landing approach. Fernandes told investigators that while he and the first officer tried to level the aircraft, it experienced an [...] "extreme updraft" [...] that pushed the plane's nose into the air. After entering a severe thunderstorm cell southwest of the airport, the crew lost directional control and was unable to recover the aircraft prior to impacting two houses in the Ensley neighborhood of Birmingham at 6:11:27 pm CDT. The airplane struck one home, crossed a tree lined residential street, and slammed into a second home, immediately erupting into flames. The lone surviving passenger was encountered in the home by the residents before all fled the burning home. The captain was taken to UAB Hospital, passenger Mabry Rogers to Carraway Methodist Medical Center, and three residents to Baptist Princeton. Twelve passengers and the first officer perished in the crash; the captain, one passenger, and four residents were injured.|$|E

60|$|Wampus rolled {{himself in}} a rug {{and was about to}} stretch his {{moderate}} length upon the broad <b>double</b> <b>seat</b> when a pattering of footsteps was heard and Beth came up to the car. She was wrapped in a dark cloak and carried a bundle of clothing under one arm and her satchel in the unoccupied hand.

6000|$|So {{they made}} their way through the long train to the tourist coach, and there found the girl they were seeking. The {{surrounding}} seats were occupied by groups of passengers of rather coarse caliber, many being foreign laborers accompanied by their wives and children. The air in the car was close and [...] "stuffy" [...] and the passengers seemed none too neat in their habits and appearance. So the solitary girl appeared like a rose blooming in a barnyard and her two visitors were instantly sorry for her. She sat in her corner, leaning wearily {{against the back of the}} cane seat, with a blanket spread over her lap. Strangely enough the consideration of her fellow passengers left the girl in undisturbed possession of a <b>double</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E
