40|$|CRIKEY is {{a planner}} that {{separates}} out the scheduling from the classical parts of temporal planning. This {{can be seen}} as a relaxation of the temporal information during the classical planning phase. Relaxations in planning are used to guide the search. However, the quality of the relaxation greatly affects the performance of the planner, and in some cases can lead the search into a dead end. This can <b>happen</b> <b>whilst</b> separating out the planning and scheduling problems, leading to the production of an unschedulable plan. CRIKEY can detect these cases and change the relaxation accordingly...|$|R

That had <b>happened</b> <b>whilst</b> M. des Amis lay dead, on the day before they buried him, and was indeed the chief reason of the delay in his burial.

The aim of this conference is to emphasise this need for scholarly rigor and practical relevance by focusing on the shape of the future and its possible consequences for managerial priorities and decision-making. We wish to encourage prospective sense-making, as well as retrospective explanations and justifications of what has already <b>happened.</b> <b>Whilst</b> the instinctive orientation of the academic world is to investigate and offer explanations of past events, the practitioner world is more pre-occupied with what will happen and what that will mean for their individual situations.

As Director, he launched the Equality Campaign, a joint campaign by Australian Marriage Equality and Australians 4 Equality to push for marriage equality.

He then crossed the floor again within the same week to bring the new Labor Earle government down.

50|$|He was {{assisted}} by John Steele, the London {{editor of the}} Chicago Tribune, who helped him contact high level members of the British Foreign Office. One of these officials in particular, C.J. Phillps, had frequent meetings with him. These meetings were later attended by H. A. L.

One of the main points Fisher expressed to Moylett was the necessity of Sinn Féin to compromise on its demands for a free and united republic. His efforts were hindered however, both to the slow and confused pace of the peace negotiations as well as the regularly occurring violence in Ireland, most especially the Bloody Sunday incident on 21 November 1920, which <b>happened</b> <b>whilst</b> he was in London speaking with members of the cabinet.|$|R
