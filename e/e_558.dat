40|$|SummaryThe oculocerebrorenal {{syndrome}} of Lowe (OCRL) is an X-linked disorder {{characterized by}} major abnormalities of eyes, nervous system, and kidneys. Mutations in the OCRL 1 gene {{have been associated}} with the disease. OCRL 1 encodes a phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -biphosphate (PtdIns[4, 5]P 2) 5 -phosphatase. We have examined the OCRL 1 gene in eight unrelated patients with OCRL and have found seven new mutations and one recurrent in-frame deletion. Among the new mutations, two nonsense mutations (R 317 X and <b>E</b> <b>558</b> X) and three other frameshift mutations caused premature termination of the protein. A missense mutation, R 483 G, was located in the highly conserved PtdIns(4, 5) P 2 5 -phosphatase domain. Finally, one frameshift mutation, 2799 delC, modifies the C-terminal part of OCRL 1, with an extension of six amino acids. Altogether, 70 % of missense mutations are located in exon 15, and 52 % of all mutations cluster in exons 11 – 15. We also identified two new microsatellite markers for the OCRL 1 locus, and we detected a germline mosaicism in one family. This observation has direct implications for genetic counseling of Lowe syndrome families...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{studies the}} world {{experience}} of using zeolites in manufacturing food packaging materials {{with a view}} to extend food storage. Antimicrobial properties of zeolites are confirmed by the results of the re-search of antifungal mixture for prolongation of food products shelf life. They correlate with the experience of using the mixture in agriculture as a fungicide and preservative for corn, root crops, sunflower, silage. The ability of zeolites to inactivate pathogens and accelerate excretion of metabolic products from the human body as well as products of disturbed metabolism and toxic compounds derived from the environment was considered. In medicine almost all zeolites are used as highly effective sorbents, and it is confirmed by the positive results of their use in the treatment of poisoning and other intoxications, and for their prevention. Thus, they can be used as raw materials in the development of food with detoxicative properties for people who face food, environmental or occupational poisoning.

MÉTODOS: Estudo {{transversal}} incluindo 1. 104 crianças abaixo de 5 anos de idade residentes na cidade de Fortaleza, Ceará. Por meio de um questionário com os pais das crianças, foram obtidas informações sobre sintomas e doenças respiratórias, história familiar de morbidade respiratória, presença de fumantes nas casas e condições de moradia. RESULTADOS: Foram estudados 546 meninas <b>e</b> <b>558</b> meninos. Das 611 crianças fumantes passivas, 82 % tinham problemas respiratórios ("odds ratio" = 1, 64; IC 95 %: 1, 21 - 2, 20). As queixas respiratórias mais freqüentes foram: chiado no peito ("odds ratio" = 1, 66; IC 95 %: 1, 21 - 2, 27), dispnéia ("odds ratio"= 1, 91; IC 95 %: 1, 36 - 2, 67), tosse e/ou expectoração("odds ratio" = 1, 58; IC 95 %: 1, 13 - 2, 84).

CONCLUSÕES: Os principais fatores de risco com chance de predizer morbidade respiratória em crianças com idade de 0 a 5 anos foram: crianças que conviviam com mães fumantes, pais fumantes, presença de mofo em casa, historia familiar de asma ou rinite. OBJECTIVE: To {{determine the}} effects of second-hand smoke in the respiratory system of children under 5 years old. METHODS: A cross sectional study of a total of 1, 104 children under 5 years old. Information about respiratory symptoms and illness, family history of respiratory diseases, smoking habits of household members and housing conditions were assessed by home interviews with the children's parents. RESULTS: We studied 546 boys and 558 girls. Among 611 children exposed to second-hand smoke, 82 % had respiratory problems (odds ratio = 1. 64; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 21 - 2. 20). Children whose parents were smokers {{at the time of the}} survey were more likely to experience wheezing than children of nonsmoking parents (odds ratio = 1. 66; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 21 - 2. 27), shortness of breath (odds ratio = 1. 91; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 36 - 2. 67), morning and day time or night coughs (odds ratio = 1. 58; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 09 - 2. 28).

40|$|Dengue is an {{emerging}} disease mainly spread throughout tropical and subtropical {{regions of the}} world. An estimate of three hundred and eighty million infections occurs annually [2]. Dengue virus (DENV) is transmitted to humans primarily by the Aedes aegypti mosquito and causes a variety of clinical illnesses classified as dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), and dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). Secondary infection and viral strain are associated with DHF/DSS. ^ Like many RNA viruses, DENV exhibits substantial genetic diversity. Such genetic subtlety may have significant implications {{for the emergence of}} new genotype(s) and lead to viruses with altered antigenicity and pathogenesis, ultimately influencing disease transmission patterns. This thesis aims to study the genetic variation of the nonstructural proteins within DENV- 2 strains from different genotypes and their influence in RNA replication and infectivity. The protein sequences of highly pathogenic (DHF) versus less pathogenic (DF) patient isolated strains from diverse geographical locations were compared. Single amino acid substitutions of conserved surface exposed residues in the NS 3 and NS 5 proteins from within strains derived from DHF patients were identified and targeted for mutagenesis using DENV- 2 16681 as the parental virus. Rescued viruses displayed varied phenotypes and were characterized by RNA synthesis and infectivity. Substitutions in NS 3 protein I 160 T, S 171 N and K 213 N had no effect on RNA synthesis or infectivity. Substitution T 399 A affected RNA synthesis by 3 logs and produced second site reversions responsible for the wild-type growth kinetics. ^ Substitution of residue I 135 T, <b>E</b> <b>558</b> K and N 730 S in the NS 5 protein had a 1 log reduction in RNA synthesis whereas I 135 V, V 723 N and K 800 T produced a 3 log reduction. Furthermore, amino acid substitution Q 819 L in the NS 5 protein showed 1 log reduction in RNA synthesis when compared to the wild type, however it completely prevented the production of plaques. Localization of NS 5 protein to the nucleus was not affected in the NS 5 substitutions. The Q 819 L substitution is defective in its ability to lyse and spread in BHK cells (i. e CPE) by fifty percent. Q 819 L amino acid substitution produced 2 to 2. 5 logs less numbers of RNA molecules when compared to the wild type, suggesting that there is a defect in the number of RNA containing particles. Single particle tracking experiments showed that wild type as well as Q 819 L virus particles were able to enter BHK and C 636 cells and fuse with cellular membranes, suggesting that the defect might be in another step of the virus life cycle. Thin sections on DENV particles showed that the Q 819 L mutant produced wild type particles (50 nm in diameter) as well as particles of approximately 30 - 35 nm in diameter, which were localized in the cytoplasm as well as within cellular compartments, suggesting that a subset of particles produced by the mutant are non-infectious subviral particles, in part explaining the lack of plaque production by plaque assay. Thin section together with qRT-PCR studies lead to the suggestion that Q 819 L is involved in the assembly process by reducing the number of release virus particles (mature and/or immature) and by increasing the number of subviral particles produced by this mutant. Coupling between genome replication and virus assembly has been reported before in YFV and KUNV NS 3 and NS 2 A proteins. This study is the first to report the role of DENV- 2 NS 5 in virus assembly. Due to the role of NS 5 in replication, as well as virus assembly and production as suggested here, NS 5 is a good target for antiviral development. ...|$|E

As esferas reticuladas nÃo foram solÃveis em meio Ãcido (pH 1, 2). Ensaios de intumescimento mostraram que as microesferas intumesciam mais em pH 1, 2 do que em pH 7, 4 e que as reticuladas possuÃam menor intumescimento do que as nÃo reticuladas. A liberaÃÃo sequenciada de cloroquina, a partir das microesferas, foi realizada por 2 h em pH 1, 2 seguida por uma liberaÃÃo em pH 7, 4. A microesfera reticulada liberou 64 % da cloroquina em pH 1, 2, com um total do fÃrmaco liberado de 92 %. O perfil de liberaÃÃo da mesma amostra em pH 7, 4 apresenta uma liberaÃÃo controlada do fÃrmaco por cerca de 50 h. NanopartÃculas de QT e CH foram produzidas utilizando como rotas de sÃntese a complexaÃÃo polieletrolÃtica e formaÃÃo de base de Schiff. Na formaÃÃo de complexos polieletrolÃticos parÃmetros como massa molar da quitosana, razÃo molar de carga (n+/n-), ordem de adiÃÃo e concentraÃÃo dos polieletrÃlitos influenciam no tamanho, potencial zeta, Ãndice de polidispersividade e estabilidade das nanopartÃculas em soluÃÃo. O potencial zeta das partÃculas com excesso de QT Ã positivo e quando se diminui a razÃo molar de carga (n+/n-) para 0, 1 o potencial torna-se negativo devido o excesso de chichÃ. Os diÃmetros das nanopartÃculas variaram de 80 a 1200 nm dependendo da concentraÃÃo dos polieletrÃlitos e da quitosana utilizada. NanopartÃculas formadas por quitosana de baixa massa molar (QTb) possuem tamanho maior do que as formadas por quitosana de alta massa molar (QTa). Quando a razÃo de cargas (n+/n-) e a concentraÃÃo dos polieletrÃlitos diminuem o tamanho das nanopartÃculas tambÃm diminui. Na liberaÃÃo da cloroquina em matrizes de CH, QTa e QTb de razÃo 5 e 0, 1 duraram cerca 15 dias liberando atÃ 99 % do fÃrmaco, porÃm apenas a razÃo de cargas influenciou no perfil da liberaÃÃo. NanopartÃculas formadas via base de Schiff foram preparadas. A influÃncia de parÃmetros tais como: grau de oxidaÃÃo da goma do chichÃ, massa molar da quitosana, ordem de adiÃÃo e razÃo entre as massas dos polissacarÃdeos foram investigados em relaÃÃo ao tamanho, potencial zeta e estabilidade. O potencial zeta mostrou-se positivo para partÃculas com excesso de QT e negativo para partÃculas com excesso de CH. Os diÃmetros das partÃculas variaram de 30 a 450 nm, dependendo do grau de oxidaÃÃo do CH e da massa molar de QT. Para goma do chichÃ com menor grau de oxidaÃÃo nanopartÃculas de QTa apresentaram-se maiores do que as formadas por QTb, e para a goma com maior grau de oxidaÃÃo nanopartÃculas de QTb possuÃam maiores tamanhos do que as formadas por QTa. The aim of {{this work}} was the {{synthesis}} and characterization of nano and microparticles for malaria drug delivery system. Chitosan microspheres of high molar mass (QTa) and chichÃ gum (CH) were synthesized by polyelectrolyte complexation and crosslinked with glutaraldehyde. The diameters of the microspheres crosslinked and non-crosslinked were 544 &# 61617; 3 &# 956;m and 558 &# 61617; 2 &# 956;m, respectively. The crosslinked beads were not soluble in acidic medium (pH 1. 2). The swelling of microspheres was higher in pH 1. 2 and that the crosslinked beads have less swelling than non-crosslinked. The sequential release of chloroquine from the microspheres was performed for 2 h followed by a release in pH 7. 4. The crosslinked microsphere released 64 % of chloroquine at pH 1. 2, {{with a total of}} drug released of 92 %. The release profile of the same sample at pH 7. 4 provides a controlled release of the drug for about 50 h. QT and CH nanoparticles were prepared using polyelectrolyte complexation and formation of Schiff base. In the formation of polyelectrolyte complex, parameters such as molecular weight of chitosan, the molar ratio of charge (n+/ n-), order of addition and concentration of the polyelectrolyte influence the size, zeta potential, polydispersity index and stability of the nanoparticles in solution. The zeta potential of particles in excess of QT was positive and when the charg molar ratio (n+/ n) decreases to 0. 1 the potential becomes negative due to the excess of CH. The nanoparticles diameters vary from 80 to 1, 200 nm depending on the concentration of the polyelectrolyte and the chitosan used. Chitosan nanoparticles formed by a low molecular weight (QTb) were larger than those formed by chitosan of high molecular weight (QTa). The decrease of the charge ratio (n+/n-) and the polyelectrolyte concentrations lead to small size nanoparticle. The release of chloroquine in matrices of CH, QTa and QTb ratio ratio 5 and 0. 1 lasted 15 days by releasing up to 99 % of the drug, however only the ratio influenced the release profile. Nanoparticles formed by Schiff base reaction were produced. The influence of parameters such as degree of oxidation of CH, chitosan molar mass, addition and masses ration of polysaccharides on size, zeta potential and stability were investigated. The zeta-potential was positive for particles with an excess of QT and negative with excess CH. The particle diameters ranged from 30 to 450 nm, depending on the degree of oxidation of CH and the molar mass of QT. Particle formed with low oxidation of CH and high molar mass chitosan are bigger than those formed with low molar mass chitosan. A inverse behavior was observed when high oxidated CH was used...|$|E

We show that the morphology of the SZ intensity maps in simulated galaxy clusters observed at 345 GHz, 600 GHz, and 857 GHz are significantly different because of SZ relativistic corrections. These differences can be revealed by high-resolution imaging instruments. We calculate relativistically corrected SZ intensity maps of a simulated, massive, merging galaxy cluster and of the massive, merging clusters 1 <b>E</b> 0657 - <b>558</b> (the Bullet Cluster) and Abell 2219. The morphologies of the SZ intensity maps are remarkably different between 345 GHz and 857 GHz for each merging cluster. We show that high-resolution imaging observations of the SZ intensity maps at these frequencies, obtainable with the LABOCA and HERSCHEL-SPIRE instruments, allow to fully exploit the astrophysical relevance of the predicted SZ morphological effect.

40|$|Dark plasma is an {{intriguing}} form of self-interacting dark matter with an effective fluid-like behavior, which is well motivated by various theoretical particle physics models. We aim {{to find an}} explanation for an isolated mass clump in the Abell 520 system, which cannot be explained by traditional models of dark matter, but has been detected in weak lensing observations. We performed N-body smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of galaxy cluster collisions with a two component model of dark matter, which is assumed to consist of a predominant non-interacting dark matter component and a 10 - 40 percent mass fraction of dark plasma. The mass of a possible dark clump was calculated for each simulation in a parameter scan over the underlying model parameters. In two higher resolution simulations shock-waves and Mach cones were observed to form in the dark plasma halos. By choosing suitable simulation parameters, the observed distributions of dark matter in both the Bullet Cluster (1 <b>E</b> 0657 - <b>558)</b> and Abell 520 (MS 0451. 5 + 0250) can be qualitatively reproduced.

40|$|The rich cluster Abell 520 (z = 0. 201) {{exhibits}} truly {{extreme and}} puzzling multi-wavelength characteristics. It may {{best be described}} as a “cosmic train wreck. ” It is a major merger showing abundant evidence for ram pressure stripping, with a clear offset in the gas distribution compared to the galaxies (as in the bullet cluster 1 <b>E</b> 0657 - <b>558).</b> However, the most striking feature is a massive dark core (721 h 70 M⊙/L⊙B) in our weak lensing mass reconstruction. The core coincides with the central X-ray emission peak, but is largely devoid of galaxies. An unusually low mass to light ratio region lies 500 kpc to the East, and coincides with a shock feature visible in radio observations of the cluster. Although a displacement between the X-ray gas and the galaxy/dark matter distributions may be expected in a merger, a mass peak without galaxies cannot be easily explained within the current collisionless dark matter paradigm. Interestingly, the integrated gas mass fraction (≈ 0. 15), mass-to-light ratio (220 h 70 M⊙/L⊙B), and position on the X-ray luminosity-temperature and mass-temperature relations are unremarkable. Thus gross properties and scaling relations are not always useful indicators of the dynamical state of clusters.

40|$|CdZnTe {{detectors}} {{are commonly}} used for room-temperature gamma-ray spectroscopy and imaging {{in a variety of}} applications including nuclear security, nuclear medicine, and space science. The material's long-established sensitivity to thermal neutrons, however, is less utilized. Generally speaking, the performance of neutron detectors based on the Cd capture reaction is limited by the physical nature of the reaction itself. Multiple gamma rays are emitted promptly following each capture event, which consists of one realization of many possible combinations of gamma-ray lines. Although the gamma-ray cascade can reduce photopeak efficiency in conventional devices, this work demonstrates that pixelated CdZnTe can recover losses by reading out each gamma-ray interaction separately. Including coincident events, the measured 558 -keV photopeak efficiency for a 3 by 3 array of 2 cm by 2 cm by 1. 5 cm pixelated CdZnTe detectors was about 10 %, i. <b>e.,</b> ten <b>558</b> keV photopeak events per 100 incident thermal neutrons. This was in good agreement with its calculated value. Initial measurements also show that neutron-gamma discrimination beyond simple energy windowing is possible when incorporating the 3 -D interaction locations of gamma rays provided by the pixelated readout. In this work, we developed and successfully demonstrated a proof-of-principle time-encoding system for thermal neutron imaging using pixelated CdZnTe. Time encoding was chosen because it is not limited by the detector's position resolution or spatial extent. These issues are exacerbated by Cd capture due to the dispersal of cascade gamma rays throughout the device. The system was first tested using a MURA-based, W-metal mask with both Co- 57 and U-metal gamma-ray sources. About 0. 3 -degree angular resolution within a 22 -degree field of view was achieved for gamma rays, and good image uniformity was observed for objects of moderate spatial extent. A MURA-based thermal neutron mask was then constructed using 1 -mm-thick BN tiles, which attained roughly 4 -degree angular resolution within a 50 -degree field of view when measuring HDPE-moderated Cf- 252. Two different thermal neutron imaging measurements were taken, with one and two moderators within the field of view. Reconstructed images corresponded well with the 3 -D locations and sizes of moderators, and had predictable signal-to-noise ratio. We believe the experimental imaging results provided here warrant further studies on the use of CdZnTe for other thermal neutron imaging scenarios...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} weak lensing mass {{reconstruction}} of the interacting cluster 1 <b>E</b> 0657 - <b>558</b> in which we detect both the main cluster and a sub-cluster. The sub-cluster is identified as a smaller cluster which has just undergone initial in-fall and pass-through of the primary cluster, and has been previously identified in both optical surveys and X-ray studies. The X-ray gas has been separated from the galaxies by ram-pressure stripping during the pass-through. The detected mass peak is located between the X-ray peak and galaxy concentration, although the position {{is consistent with the}} galaxy centroid within the errors of the mass reconstruction. We find that the mass peak for the main cluster is in good spatial agreement with the cluster galaxies and offset from the X-ray halo at 3. 4 sigma significance, and determine that the mass-to-light ratios of the two components are consistent with those of relaxed clusters. The observed offsets of the lensing mass peaks from the peaks of the dominant visible mass component (the X-ray gas) directly demonstrate the presence, and dominance, of dark matter in this cluster. This proof of the dark matter existence holds true even under the assumption of modified Newtonian gravity (MOND); from the observed gravitational shear to optical light ratios and mass peak - X-ray gas offsets, the dark matter component in a MOND regime has a total mass which is at least equal to the baryonic mass of the system.

40|$|Bacillus subtilis {{cytochrome}} b 558 is a {{transmembrane protein}} which anchors succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) to the cytoplasmic membrane and {{is reduced by}} succinate. The structural gene for this cytochrome was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Random BamHI or BglII fragments of B. subtilis 168 DNA were cloned in the BamHI site of plasmid pHV 32. The derived plasmids were used to transform B. subtilis SDH mutants to chloramphenicol resistance by integration of the plasmid via DNA homology. Of some 3, 000 transformants tested, 6 were SDH positive and had pHV 32 integrated close to the sdh operon. Two plasmids, pKIM 2 and pKIM 4, with an insert of B. subtilis DNA of 5. 7 and 3. 4 kilobases, respectively, were generated by transforming E. coli with DNA from the SDH-positive transformants after cleavage with EcoRI or BglII and ligation. In E. coli carrying {{either of the two}} plasmids, about 4 % of total membrane protein was B. subtilis cytochrome b <b>558.</b> <b>E.</b> coli (pKIM 2) also contained antigen which reacted with antibodies specific for the flavoprotein and the iron-sulfur protein subunit of B. subtilis SDH.

The B. subtilis DNA insert in pKIM 2 could transform B. subtilis sdhA (cytochrome b 558), sdhB (flavoprotein), and sdhC (iron-sulfur protein) mutants to the wild type. The results suggest that pKIM 2 carries the whole B. subtilis sdh operon. The data confirm the gene order and the proposed direction of transcription of the B. subtilis sdh operon.

40|$|The dust {{detector}} system onboard Galileo has recoding dust impacts in circumjovian space since the spacecraft was injected into a bound orbit about Jupiter in December 1995. This is the sixth {{in a series}} of papers dedicated to presenting Galileo and Ulysses dust data. We present data from the Galileo dust instrument for the period January to December 1996 when the spacecraft completed four orbits about Jupiter (G 1, G 2, C 3 and E 4). Data were obtained as high-resolution realtime science data or recorded data during a time period of 100 days, or via memory read-outs during the remaining times. Because the data transmission rate of the spacecraft is very low, the complete data set (i. e. all parameters measured by the instrument during impact of a dust particle) for only 2 % (5353) of all particles detected could be transmitted to Earth; the other particles were only counted. Together with the data for 2883 particles detected during Galileo's interplanetary cruise and published earlier, complete data of 8236 particles detected by the Galileo dust instrument from 1989 to 1996 are now available. The majority of particles detected are tiny grains (about 10 nm in radius) originating from Jupiter's innermost Galilean moon Io. These grains have been detected throughout the Jovian system and the highest impact rates exceeded 100 min - 1. A small number of grains has been detected in the close vicinity of the Galilean moons Europa, Ganymede and Callisto which belong to impact-generated dust clouds formed by (mostly submicrometer sized) ejecta from the surfaces of the moons (Krüger et al., 1999 <b>e.</b> Nature 399, <b>558).</b> Impacts of submicrometer to micrometer sized grains have been detected throughout the Jovian system and especially in the region between the Galilean moons...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is {{emerging}} as a relatively common cause of sudden death in teenagers and athletes. ARVC is considered a disease of cell adhesion because mutations in desmosomal genes {{have been involved in}} the pathogenesis of ARVC in a significant proportion of patients. The aim of the present study is to elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of ARVC by generating DSG 2 transgenic animal models. Methods. Human full−length wild−type and mutant cDNA sequences for DSG 2 were cloned into a vector containing alpha−MyHC promoter. Transgenic lines showing a comparable expression level of transgene have been generated for G 100 R, N 266 S, K 294 <b>E</b> and Q <b>558</b> X mutations and for wild-type DSG 2. Phenotypic characterisation was performed by electrophysiological and histological analyses. In order to investigate on the molecular pathogenesis, electron miscroscopic, immunohystochemical and Western blot examination was performed as well. Results. Histological examination of 6 -month-old mouse hearts evidentiated cardiomyocytes loss and fibro-fatty tissue replacement, resembling the phenotype of ARVC patients and confirming the pathogenic effects of DSG 2 mutations in an animal model. Immunofluorescent staining showed correct localization of DSG 2 G 100 R, N 266 S, and K 294 E into the desmosomal complexes, while in mice carrying the DSG 2 -Q 558 X mutation the protein was retained in the cytoplasm. Electron microscopic analyses showed a reduced number of desmosomes at the intercalated discs, myofibrillar degeneration and damaged mitochondria. Beta-catenin overexpression has been detected by Western blotting analysis and immunofluorescence in hearts of transgenic mice carrying the mutated proteins. DSG 2 transgenic mice have been inbreeded with beta-catenin-activated transgene driving expression of nuclear beta-galactosidase reporter (BAT-gal) transgenic mice, in order to confirm beta-catenin overexpression. Analyses of BAT-gal expression in embrionic and neonatal transgenic hearts revealed a higher beta-catenin transcriptional activity compared to wild-type hearts. Conclusions. DSG 2 transgenic mice represents an invaluable model to investigate molecular pathogenesis of ARVC. Further studies will be needed to assess if beta-catenin overexpression could lead to beta-catenin signalling defects...|$|R

After introducing the formalism, we apply this statistics to four very massive high redshift clusters. Those clusters comprise ACT-CL J 0102 - 4915 with a mass of M_ 200 m=(2. 16 +/- 0. 32) x 10 ^{ 15 } M_sun at a redshift of z= 0. 87, SPT-CL J 2106 - 5844 with a mass of M_ 200 m=(1. 27 +/- 0. 21) x 10 ^{ 15 } M_sun at z= 1. 132 and two clusters found by the XMM-Newton Distant Cluster Project survey: XMMU J 2235. 32557 with a mass of M_ 200 c= (7. 3 +/- 1. 3) x 10 ^{ 14 } M_sun located at a redshift of z= 1. 4 and XMMU J 0044. 0 - 2033 having a mass {{in the range of}} M_ 200 c= (3. 5 - 5. 0) x 10 ^{ 14 } M_sun at z= 1. 579. By relating those systems to their corresponding distribution functions of being the most massive system in a given survey area, we find that none of the systems alone is in extreme tension with LCDM.
