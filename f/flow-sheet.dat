The present paper summarizes the on-going research activities at Forschungszentrum Julich (FZJ), Karlsruher Institut fur Technologie (KIT) and Institute for Transuranium Elements (ITU) in the field of actinide partitioning using innovative solvent extraction processes. European research over the last few decades, i. e. in the NEWPART, PARTNEW and EUROPART programmes, has resulted in the development of multi-cycle processes for minor actinide partitioning. These multi-cycle processes are based on the co-separation of trivalent actinides and lanthanides (e. g. by the DIAMEX process), followed by the subsequent actinide(III) /lanthanide(III) group separation in the SANEX: process. The current direction of research for the development of innovative processes within the recent European ACSEPT project is discussed additionally. This paper is focused on the development of <b>flow-sheets</b> for recovery of americium and curium from highly active waste solutions. The <b>flow-sheets</b> are verified by demonstration processes, in centrifugal contactors, using synthetic or genuine fuel solutions. The feasibility of the processes is also discussed...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOne of the {{criteria}} to define {{the market value of}} chromite concentrate is its chromium to iron ratio. Changing this ratio for a definite chromite mineral is impossible by physical processing. This study investigated the possibility of increasing this ratio through the carbochlorination and the oxychlorination of chromite concentrates. Experiments are carried out up to 1000 °C. The characteristics of samples and reaction products are determined by SEM, XRD and chemical analysis. The carbochlorination of a chromite concentrate at about 600 °C leads to the selective partial elimination of iron allowing a higher Cr/Fe ratio of the treated concentrate. Selective extraction of iron could also be achieved at about 950 °C by oxychlorination. In this case, a part of chromium contained in the concentrate is recovered as chromium oxychloride. The obtained residue had high content of Cr, Mg and Al oxides. Such material has probably better chemical and thermal properties that may be useful for foundry and refractory applications.

40|$|AbstractA {{balanced}} portfolio of mitigating power generation technologies {{is required to}} meet global CO 2 reduction targets, of which Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle with CO 2 Capture and Storage (IGCC-CCS) from coal is one. The sour water gas shift (WGS) reaction is a key conversion step in the IGCC-CCS process and is responsible for about 44 % of the efficiency penalty that CCS would confer on IGCC with current technology, due principally to the diversion of steam from steam turbines to the shift process. A multi-faceted development program has been undertaken to drive down this penalty, considering different reactor types, new catalyst formulations and process integration. Process evaluation has shown cost of electricity (CoE) reductions of 3 - 4 % with the combination of significantly reduced steam addition and the utilisation of improved reactor designs with initial catalyst performance data. Higher reductions in CoE of up to 7 % are obtainable, dependent upon the gasifier selection.

40|$|Postconsumer {{plastics}} from packing {{and packaging}} represent about the 60 % of the total plastic wastes (i. e. 23 million of tons) produced in Europe. The EU Directive (2014 / 12 /EC) fixes as target that the 60 %, by weight, of packaging waste has to be recovered, or thermally valorized. When recovered, the same directive established that packaging waste has to be recycled in a percentage ranging between 55 % (minimum) and 60 % (maximum). The non-respect of these rules can produce that large quantities of end-of-life plastic products, specifically those utilized for packaging, are disposed-off, with a strong environmental impact. The application of recycling strategies, finalized to polymer recovery, can represent an opportunity to reduce: i) not renewable raw materials (i. e. oil) utilization, ii) carbon dioxide emissions and iii) amount of plastic waste disposed-off. Aim of this work was to perform a full characterization of different end-of-life polymers based products, constituted not only by single polymers but also of mixtures, in order to realize their identification for quality control and/or certification assessment. The study was specifically addressed to characterize the different recovered products as resulting from a recycling plant where classical processing <b>flow-sheets,</b> based on milling, classification and separation, are applied. To reach this goal, an innovative sensing technique, based on the utilization of a HyperSpectral Imaging (HSI) device working in the SWIR region (1000 - 2500 nm), was investigated. Following this strategy, single polymers and/or mixed polymers recovered were correctly recognized.

40|$|Abstract: Industrial {{processes}} pose {{a serious}} threat to the world’s natural resources for they consume them in high proportions as sources of energy for driving chemical processes that provide raw materials for many industrial chemicals. The chemical and petrochemical industries consume about 61 % of global industrial energy and emit about 36 % of carbon dioxide to the environment. A significant portion of the energy demand is entirely for feedstock, which cannot be reduced through energy efficiency measures. The responsibility therefore for cutting back on the amount of energy needed for chemical processes rests on improving the efficiency of the processes used. The purpose of this research is to demonstrate the use of a novel method of synthesizing process flowsheets, using a graphical tool called the GH-space and in particular to look at how {{it can be used to}} compare the reactions of a combined simultaneous process with regard to their thermodynamics. This allows us to synthesize <b>flow-sheets</b> that are reversible and which meet the process targets by implementing mass and energy integration. It also provides guidance on what design decisions would be best suited to developing new processes that are more effective and make lower demands on raw material and energy usage. The approach also provides useful information for evaluating processes through likely limiting extents with respect to the reaction pathways, and comparison between the research findings and their theoretical targets in order to identify any possible energy savings that can be made. The GH-space technique uses fundamental thermodynamic principles to allow the mass, energy and work balances locate the attainable region for chemical processes in a reactor. Furthermore, processes and unit operations can be defined as vectors in the GH-space. Using the targets, one can combine the vector processes in such a way as to approach the target. These vector processes, and the way they are combined, can then be interpreted in terms of flowsheets. This is opposite to what is normally done and allows the process balances to determine what the best flowsheet might look like, allowing for great innovation from the very start of a design. In addition to this, probably the greatest advantage of the GH-space technique is that processes of great complexity can all be analysed on a set of two-dimensional axes. After finding the attainable region, its boundaries can be interpreted in [...] . M. Tech. (Chemical Engineering...|$|R
40|$|This {{work was}} {{conducted}} within the Swedish Skogskemi (“forest chemicals”) project funded by Vinnova and aiming at investigating promising and competitive options for biomass based production of chemical intermediates such as olefins, methanol and butanol. The present report documents {{the contribution of}} Matteo Morandin to project work package on biomass gasification routes for methanol production and in particular focuses on mass and energy balances of three process concepts based on different gasification and gas cleaning technologies. In addition, the report discusses process integration opportunities for the biorefinery processes with industrial plants, such as the Stenungsund chemical cluster and the Värö and Iggesund pulp and paper mills, {{all of which were}} actively involved in the Skogskemi project. The characteristics of the three processes (gasification technology, location, size) were decided ex ante based on preliminary economic considerations such as maturity of technology and economy of scale aspects and represent an input to this work. The complete process layouts for the three plants were put together based on typical arrangements suggested in the literature for similar processes and on established engineering principles. The mass and energy balances of the three process <b>flow-sheets</b> were estimated with the help of Aspen plus and process models partially or completely available in the literature and partially developed at the Division of Industrial Energy Systems and Technologies, Chalmers. Following a rather common approach for preliminary design of chemical processes, the heating or cooling required to carry out the various thermochemical conversions from biomass to methanol were modelled as heaters and coolers. This allowed applying an energy targeting approach, Pinch Analysis, to estimate ideal heat recovery opportunities for the biomass based processes. As a result of the heat recovery analysis, the net heat available from the biomass based conversion processes (target) was obtained. Different opportunities for either exporting this heat to partially or fully replacing the steam deficit of the nearby industrial plants or for power generation by means of a heat recovery steam cycles are discussed. The thermodynamic performances of the three plants are then compared considering the combined effects of the material conversion from biomass to methanol and the fossil fuel savings in marginal heat and electricity producers {{as a consequence of the}} new heat and power balances at the industrial site once the biomass based processes are in place.

40|$|Objectives  The primary {{objective}} of this systematic review {{was to assess the}} effectiveness of nursing interventions for the relief/reduction of post-operative pain when compared with either standard care or other nursing interventions. Inclusion criteria  Types of studies This review included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and other quasi-randomised experimental research designs. Types of participants Adults treated for post-operative pain in an acute care hospital. Types of interventions Interventions included in the review were only those directly administered by nursing staff such as: (i) administration of analgesia: including oral, intramuscular injection, patient controlled analgesia, epidural; (ii) pre-operative patient education; (iii) assessment and documentation of intensity of pain at regular intervals; (iv) protocols, clinical pathways or <b>flow-sheets</b> used in the management of pain; and (v) non-pharmacological interventions such as massage and relaxation. Types of outcome measures The primary outcome was the relief or reduction of post-operative pain. Other measures included analgesia consumption, patient satisfaction and length of hospital stay. Search strategy  Search terms were chosen after reviewing text words and MeSH terms in relevant articles and databases. A search for published and unpublished research covering the period 1985 - 2004 (inclusive) was conducted, using 11 major electronic databases. Reference lists of retrieved articles were hand searched. The search was restricted to reports published in English. Assessment of quality  The methodological quality of eligible studies was appraised by two independent reviewers, using a standardised critical appraisal tool. Differences in opinion were decided by consensus after discussion with a third investigator. Data extraction and analysis  Data were extracted from the studies that met the criteria for methodological quality. Two reviewers independently extracted data for each study, using a standardised extraction tool. Results from homogeneous RCTs where possible were pooled in meta-analysis using RevMan 4. 2 software program. If the studies were clinically or statistically heterogeneous, the results are discussed in a narrative form. Non-randomised studies are also discussed in narrative form. Results  Overall, there is no strong evidence to support the use of any intervention even though a few interventions showed some benefits. However, evidence for these benefits was often based on single studies. Most of the included studies showed that {{there was no difference between}} the interventions and the usual care with both being found equally effective. Implications for practice  There was no strong evidence to support a particular practice. No intervention was found to be harmful; however, this does not presume to be evidence of safety. When there are two similarly effective interventions nurses need to weigh the possible positive and negative of the intervention including side effects, risk of adverse events, cost and patient preference. Other considerations include variations in patients' past pain experiences, type of surgery, many different analgesics. Although there were no controlled trials to support assessment and documentation, professionally and legally, documentation is required...|$|R

Faleceram 258 RN, com um coeficiente de mortalidade neonatal de 12, 7 por mil. A taxa de natimortalidade foi de 18, 4 por mil. O coeficiente de mortalidade perinatal foi de 28, 4 por mil. A incidência de baixo peso ao nascer (OBJECTIVE - Epidemiological {{analysis of}} neonatal and perinatal mortality of 20, 280 newborns alive with 500 g {{or more and}} 374 stillbirths occurred at the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre from 1984 to 1990. PURPOSE- To compare two periods: A (1984 - 1987) with B (1988 - 1990), estabilishing {{a relationship between the}} changes occurred in the causes and the rate of mortality. METHODS - The retrospective study was done with the records of promptuaries of obstetrical and neonatal centers, and review of <b>flow-sheets</b> of the deaths and autopsies. RESULTS - Between 1984 to 1990, 20, 280 newborns alive with 500 g or more, 374 stillbirths at perinatal unit of Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre were born. 258 deaths occurred, the neonatal mortality rate was 12. 7 per thousand. The stillbirth rate was 18. 4 per thousand. The perinatal mortality rate was 28. 4 per thousand. The incidence of low birth weight (< 2, 500 g) was 11, 2 % and very low birth weight (< 1, 500 g) was 1. 8 %, the former group had an increase incidence between 1984 - 1988 (A) from 1. 5 % to 2. 2 % (B). The causes of deaths were distributed as follow: a) intrauterine infections (22. 4 %); b) hyaline membrane disease (20. 1 %); c) congenital malformation (18. 2 %); d) asphyxia (15. 5 %); e) postnatal infections (9. 7 %). The causes of stillbirth were: a) perinatal asphyxia (38. 7 %); b) intrauterine infections (9 %); toxemia (8. 2 %); d) malformation (7. 4 %). The period B showed changes with an increase of postnatal infections odds ratio (OR) 7 (1. 9 - 30. 6) and congenital malformations OR 1. 6 (0. 8 - 3. 2). It did not occurred a decrease in mortality rate for prematures below 1, 500 g OR 90 (61 - 118) in A to 54 (37 - 68) in B. CONCLUSIONS - The advances in technology and human capacity were not sufficient to reduce significantly the rate of neonatal mortality...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{optimization}} {{study has been}} conducted on an existing 130 tonne per day carbon dioxide capture plant. A rate- based modelling approach is used to simulate {{the performance of the}} CO 2 capture plant using actual plant process <b>flow-sheet</b> and operating parameters. The average absolute deviation of the predicted parameters from the measured parameters is within 8 %. The developed rate-based model is then used to plan the operating conditions for optimum utilization of the resources. Based on the results obtained from the process optimization, it is possible to minimize the operating cost and enhance the production capacity of the CO 2 capture plant at minimum additional investment...|$|E
