5000|$|The logs in log {{houses have}} a varying degree of {{moisture}} content; all logs have moisture when freshly cut. In the case of handcrafted logs moisture will naturally leave the timber, drying it out until it stabilizes with its climate. This drying-out causes movement and shrinking of the log's diameter. As logs and timbers dry, the <b>differential</b> <b>shrinkage</b> (radial versus tangential) causes small cracks (known as [...] "checks") to open slowly over time. Checking is a natural process in both air- and kiln-dried logs. This occurs in all log houses regardless of construction method or how the timber is allowed to dry, and is considered normal.|$|E
5000|$|Green or wet turning - turning wood {{while its}} {{moisture}} content is above equilibrium. Often done when the wood is newly felled. May be turned to finished thickness, {{in which case}} the <b>differential</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of the wood will result in a finished piece that is not perfectly round. Alternatively, it may be [...] "rough turned". Rough turning involves turning the piece only to its general shape, leaving enough thickness so that after turning it can be allowed to dry to equilibrium moisture content and distort. The advantage over first drying the wood then turning is that a rough turned piece dries faster, will probably distort instead of split as solid wood tends to, and that wet wood turns better, since it creates less dust. Rough turning is inexact science: turning wood too thick will lead to splits, turning wood too thin will lead to distortion that cannot be removed, because not enough thickness is left. Once dry, it is mounted on the lathe a second time and turned to its final form. Rough turning is typically used on most functional work and some artistic pieces.|$|E

Other factors could also reduce the value of <b>differential</b> <b>shrinkage,</b> Δεsh(t), for example due to deformation of substrate concrete.

The {{main purpose of}} this study is to highlight the variation of multiaxial mechanical behaviour of mortars which depends on desiccation level and cement paste properties (quality). The behaviour under discussion includes uniaxial and triaxial strengths, elastic properties and volumetric strains due to hydrostatic loading. Multiaxial experiments, carried out on two mortars for which the only difference was the water by cement ratio (w / c = 0. 5 and 0. 8), show a competitive effect between the increase in material rigidity due to capillary suction and saturation gradients, and the microcracking which comes from material heterogeneity and <b>differential</b> <b>shrinkages</b> of the sample. This effect mainly depends on cement paste properties and its porosity; therefore the capillary suction effect is preponderant for a high paste quality (i. e. lower porosity) while a low paste quality would be more sensitive to microcracking...|$|R

40|$|The {{residual}} {{compressive strength}} behavior of alkali activated slag paste (AASP) after temperature exposures up to 1, 200 &# 0176;C was investigated. Strength loss of approximately 60 % occurred between 100 and 200 &# 0176;C and a further strength {{loss in the}} order of 30 % at 800 &# 0176;C. Total loss of strength occurred at 1, 200 &# 0176;C. Thermogravimetric studies (TGA/DTG) verified AASP contained no Ca(OH) 2 which governs the chemical mechanism of strength loss for ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and blended slag cement pastes. However, the TGA results showed that AASP had a higher water loss than the other binders between 100 and 200 &# 0176;C and higher thermal shrinkage as indicated by the dilatometry studies. The high thermal shrinkage led to a <b>differential</b> thermal <b>shrinkage</b> gradient within the AASP and induced micro stresses and cracking which was more prominent for larger samples. <b>Differential</b> thermal <b>shrinkage</b> caused by the higher thermal shrinkage of the AAS material was concluded as the mechanism which gives lower residual strength in AASP compared to OPCP...|$|R

Due to the <b>differential</b> <b>shrinkage</b> property, the fabric becomes curly and bulkier, simulating cotton fabric {{in terms of its}} appearance and fabric handle. The performance and appearance of these DS polyester warp knitted fabrics were evaluated objectively and subjectively. The testing results demonstrated that the DS polyester warp knitted fabric had better abrasion property, worse pilling resistance due to the mechanical property of polyester yarn when compared with 100 % cotton warp knitted fabric. Meanwhile, lower water vapour permeability and air resistance were found for DS polyester warp knitted fabric resulting from the dense structure of yarn shrinkage after heat-moisture treatment. Besides, the fabric handle was evaluated by Kawabata evaluation system and subject to trial under dry and wet fabric condition. DS polyester warp knitted fabrics provide better recovery under low stress mechanical pressure. The subjective evaluation result shows that the warp knitted fabrics made of DS polyester had similar handle against cotton warp knitted fabric in terms of prickle, smooth, comfort and dry feeling in both dry and wet testing conditions...|$|E

40|$|Mechanistic {{analysis}} of jointed concrete pavements has often considered only traffic loading in tensile stress calculation. The analysis is often {{reduced to a}} single or dual wheel load positioned at a free slab edge. More advanced analyses have included environmental loading, but this is usually limited to a linear temperature differential through the slab. This type of analysis usually predicts bottom-up transverse cracking {{in the center of}} the slab. However, field data has indicated that other failure modes can also occur. This paper quantitatively demonstrates how the failure mode of jointed concrete pavements can be transverse, corner, or longitudinal cracking, originating at either the top or bottom of the slab. The failure mode depends on the loading, slab geometry, environment, and material properties. The <b>differential</b> drying <b>shrinkage</b> of the concrete was found to be one of the most influential parameters in reproducing the observed failure modes of in-situ concrete pavement...|$|R

Longitudinal shrinkage is critical for stability of wood, because wooden boards have much longer longitudinal dimensions, and shrinkage in this direction increases with MFA (Harris & Meylan, 1965).

Pore evolution in each sample during isothermal sintering was examined metallographically. The compositional changes across sample mid-cross section and surface layers were analyzed using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth profiling, respectively. The two outer samples bent toward the middle one, while the middle sample was essentially distortion free after sintering.

40|$|Test {{sections}} of jointed plain concrete pavement were constructed with fast-setting hydraulic cement concrete (FSHCC) {{as part of}} the California Department of Transportation accelerated pavement-testing program. Many of the longer slabs cracked under environmental influences before any traffic load was applied to them.

Cores drilled through the cracks indicated that cracking began {{at the top of the}} slabs and propagated downward. This was confirmed with the ILLI-SLAB (ILSL 2) finite-element package in which high tensile stresses were predicted at the top of the slab as a result of the <b>differential</b> drying <b>shrinkage</b> between the top and base of the slab and the nonlinear nature of the negative temperature gradients through the slab. Laboratory free-shrinkage tests with the test section concrete indicated significantly higher levels of shrinkage compared with that achieved with ordinary Type II portland cement.

40|$|The {{long-term}} behaviour {{of concrete}} beams constructed with geopolymer concrete (GPC) is investigated. Self-weight and sustained load of 1 kPa are applied {{on top of}} the beams at the age of 14 days to simulate construction conditions. Creep tests on cylinders conducted with sustained loading commenced at the ages of 14 days and 28 days. The results from creep tests on GPC show higher creep in the specimens loaded at 14 days than those loaded at 28 days. Predictions of beam deflections are performed by using RCM, EMM and AEMM with input parameters of properties of GPC from experimental data, including elastic modulus, modulus of rupture, creep and shrinkage. These property tests show that GPC can achieve sufficient strength for structural designs, but both compressive strength and flexural tensile strength are affected by drying, which causes <b>differential</b> drying <b>shrinkage</b> and microcracking at the drying surfaces. The predicted deflections by these analysis methods are compared with the experimental results from beams, and show that RCM gives the worse performance of the three methods.

40|$|AbstractPressureless {{sintering}} of powder-processed functionally graded {{materials is}} being pursued to economically produce metal–ceramic composites {{for a variety}} of high-temperature (e. g., thermal protection) and energy-absorbing (e. g., armor) applications. During sintering, <b>differential</b> <b>shrinkage</b> induces stresses that can compromise the integrity of the components. Because the strength evolves as the component is sintered, it is important to model how the evolution of the <b>differential</b> <b>shrinkage</b> governs the stress distribution in the component in order to determine when the strength will be exceeded and cracking initiated. In this investigation, a model is proposed that describes the processing/microstructure/property/performance relationship in pressurelessly sintered functionally graded plates and rods. This model can be used to determine appropriate shrinkage rates and gradient architectures for a given component geometry that will prevent the component from cracking during pressureless sintering by balancing the evolution of strength, which is assumed to be a power law function of the porosity, with the evolution of stress. To develop this model, the powder mixture is considered as a three-phase material consisting of voids, metal particles, and ceramic particles. A micromechanical thermal elastic–viscoplastic constitutive model is then proposed to describe the thermomechanical behavior of the composite microstructure. The subsequent evolution of the thermomechanical properties of the matrix material during sintering is assumed to obey a power law relationship with the level of porosity, which {{is directly related to the}} shrinkage strain, and was refined to account for the evolving interparticle cohesion of the matrix phase due to sintering. These thermomechanical properties are incorporated into a 2 -D thermomechanical finite element analysis to predict the stress distributions and distortions that arise from the evolution of <b>differential</b> <b>shrinkage</b> during the pressureless sintering process. <b>Differential</b> <b>shrinkage</b> results were verified quantitatively through comparison with the shape profile for a pressurelessly sintered functionally graded nickel–alumina composite plate with a cylindrical geometry, and the stress distribution results verified from qualitative observations of the absence or presence of cracking as well as the location in specimens with different gradient architectures. The cracking was mitigated using a reverse gradient at one end of the specimen, and the resulting distortions associated with the shape profile were determined to be no more than 15 % reduced from the predictions. The effects of geometry were also studied out-of-plane by transforming the plate into a rod through an increase in thickness, while in-plane effects were studied by comparing the results from the cylindrical specimen with a specimen that has a square cross-sectional geometry. By transforming from a plate to a rod geometry, the stress no longer exceeds critical levels and cracks do not form. The results from the in-plane geometric study indicated that critical stresses were reached in the square geometry at temperatures 100 °C less than in the cylindrical geometry. Additionally, the location of primary cracking was shifted towards the metal-rich end of the specimen, while the stress distribution associated with this shift and the lower temperature for the critical stress resulted in secondary cracking...|$|E

Variations in wood equilibrium moisture content, density and dimensions were studied at air temperatures of 22 °C and 27 °C (representing acclimatized homes and summer non-acclimatized homes, respectively) varying from 80 % to 30 % of relative humidity. For indoor uses (22 - 27 °C, 50 - 65 % of relative humidity), the wood equilibrium moisture content ranged 12 - 17 % and these values are recommended for the final commercial drying of cork oak wood.

40|$|Central {{to human}} intelligence, visual {{categorization}} is {{a skill that}} is both remarkably fast and accurate. Although {{there have been numerous}} studies in primates regarding how information flows in inferiortemporal (ITC) and prefrontal (PFC) cortices during online discrimination of visual categories, there has been little comparable research on the human cortex. To bridge this gap, this thesis explores how visual categories emerge in prefrontal cortex and the ventral stream, which is the human homologue of ITC. In particular, cortical spatiotemporal plasticity in visual category learning was investigated using behavioral experiments, magnetoencephalographic (MEG) imaging, and statistical machine learning methods. From a theoretical perspective, scientists from work on non-human primates have posited that PFC plays a primary role in the encoding of visual categories. Much of the extant research in the cognitive neuroscience literature, however, emphasizes the role of the ventral stream. Despite their apparent incompatibility, no study has evaluated these theories in the human cortex by examining the roles of the ventral stream and PFC in online discrimination and acquisition of visual categories. To address this question, I conducted two learning experiments using visually-similar categories as stimuli and recorded cortical response using MEG—a neuroimaging technique that offers a millisecond temporal resolution. Across both experiments, categorical information was found to be available during the period of cortical activity. Moreover, late in the learning process, this information is supplied increasingly in the ventral stream but less so in prefrontal cortex. These findings extend previous theories by suggesting that the ventral stream is crucial to long-term encoding of visual categories when categorical perception is proficient, but that PFC jointly encodes visual categories early on during learning. From a methodological perspective, MEG is limited as a technique because it can lead to false discoveries in a large number of spatiotemporal regions of interest (ROIs) and, typically, can only coarsely reconstruct the spatial locations of cortical responses. To address the first problem, I developed an excursion algorithm that identified ROIs contiguous in time and space. I then used a permutation test to measure the global statistical significance of the ROIs. To address the second problem, I developed a method that incorporates domainspecific and experimental knowledge in the modeling process. Utilizing faces as a model category, I used a predefined “face” network to constrain the estimation of cortical activities by applying <b>differential</b> <b>shrinkages</b> to regions within and outside this network. I proposed and implemented a trial-partitioning approach which uses trials in the midst of learning for model estimation. Importantly, this renders localizing trials more precise in both the initial and final phases of learning. In summary, this thesis makes two significant contributions. First, it methodologically improves the way we can characterize the spatiotemporal properties of the human cortex using MEG. Second, it provides a combined theory of visual category learning by incorporating the large time scales that encompass the course of the learning...|$|R

The principle modes of repair failure were cracking (32  %), debonding (25  %), continued corrosion of embedded reinforcement (22  %), alkali aggregate reaction (4  %) and others (17  %). In term of cracking, this mode of repair failure could be triggered by restraint of drying shrinkage. As repair material is applied on top of damaged concrete, they turn into composite system. The new repair material will shrink considerably while the shrinkage of the substrate concrete is negligible. This <b>differential</b> <b>shrinkage</b> creates restraint to the deformation of repair material. In turn, tensile stress is induced in the repair material.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine variations in the physical properties of non-compacted soil-sand aggregates in terms of binary packing theory. Two soils were used, a swelling black earth and a krasnozem with low swelling capacity, and aggregates with varying clay percentage were prepared by dispersing the soil, mixing with 100 - 50 nm sand, and wetting and drying. At lower clay percentages, void ratio with increasing clay was greater than that predicted from theory. This was attributed to clay entering between sand junctions and increasing porosity by expanding the coarse matrix. From water retention and swelling data, the transition from coarse to fine matrix occurs in both soils at about 40 % clay. In the fine particle matrix, variation of void ratio in the krasnozem aggregates was as expected from theory. In the black earth, no significant variation in void ratio occurs at clay percentages > 40 %. This was attributed to porosity created around the sand particles owing to <b>differential</b> swelling and <b>shrinkage.</b> Results obtained by other workers are explained in terms of binary packing theory and the concepts developed in this paper...|$|R
