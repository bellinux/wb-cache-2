While this is a radioactive metal, the risk of cancer is low as it never gets airborne in normal usage. Only if the filament is taken out of the magnetron, <b>finely</b> <b>crushed,</b> and inhaled can it pose a health hazard.|$|E
25|$|In 1807, Nicéphore Niépce and {{his brother}} Claude created what was {{probably}} the world's first internal combustion engine (which they called a Pyréolophore), but they chose to install it in a boat on the river Saone in France. Coincidentally, in 1807 the Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed his own 'de Rivaz internal combustion engine' {{and used it to}} develop the world's first vehicle to be powered by such an engine. The Niépces' Pyréolophore was fuelled by a mixture of Lycopodium powder (dried spores of the Lycopodium plant), <b>finely</b> <b>crushed</b> coal dust and resin that were mixed with oil, whereas de Rivaz used a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen. Neither design was very successful, {{as was the case with}} others, such as Samuel Brown, Samuel Morey, and Etienne Lenoir with his hippomobile, who each produced vehicles (usually adapted carriages or carts) powered by internal combustion engines.|$|E

40|$|Issue: Processed {{recycled}} glass {{has been sold}} as an abrasive blasting medium under several brand names {{in different parts of}} the United States. However, limited public information is available regarding the performance of <b>finely</b> sized <b>crushed</b> glass in abrasive applications because manufacturers have developed their own proprietary data. Historically, the predominant material used for abrasive blasting was silica sand, hence the common reference to “sandblasting. ” Other media include garnet, staurolite and industrial by-products such as coal slag, copper slag, nickel slag and steel grit. Even walnut shells and plastic beads have been used for abrasive blasting. Individual abrasive media performance depends on hardness, shape, size, weight, and other characteristics. Health- considerations are sometimes significant in evaluating blasting abrasives. For example, concerns about silicosis due to the presence of crystalline silica have resulted in very little silica sand now being used in abrasive blasting. Best Practice: While silica sand is a raw material used in the production of glass (see Chemical Composition of Container Glass Best Practice), the manufacturing process converts the crystalline structure to an amorphous state. Tests have shown that recycled container glass contains less than 1 % crystalline silica (see Analysis of Glass Dusts Best Practice). Lower health risk represents a potential competitive market advantage for {{recycled glass}}, which can be processed to physical characteristics simila...|$|R

40|$|Laboratory {{reflection}} polarimetry {{is presented}} for crushed rocks, lunar soils, and 24 meteoritic samples. The polarization-phase curves {{found for the}} meteorites closely resemble telescopic results for minor planets, {{but only if the}} samples are <b>crushed</b> <b>finely</b> enough to coat the larger particles with dust. The results generally confirm the identifications previously made from reflection spectroscopy for the meteoritic analogues of various types of asteroids; the more metal-rich ordinary chondrites, for example, match telescopic observations of the S-type minor planets well enough, as do the basaltic achondrites for Vesta. No meteorite measured, however, has a geometric albedo less than 0. 05 as required for many of the C asteroids. A calibration of the polarimetric slope-albedo law, now determined strictly for meteoritic samples, confirms the asteroid albedo and diameter scale derived by the independent method of thermal radiometry...|$|R
40|$|Certain mineral {{additions}} exploit a {{very significant}} role the behavior and the ageing of the works in the corrosive conditions and one can use them like barriers against the aggressiveness and the phenomenon of corrosion of the concretes. Cements made up of additions can be recommended especially in massive works, the stoppings, maritime and underground constructions and in the cementing of the oil wells. The use of the adequate additions ensures the long-term stability and durability of the concretes of the underground, maritime works and the cementing of the oil wells… etc. To this end, {{within the framework of}} valorization of these additions (active and inert), in this study we were interested only {{in the study of the}} influence of incorporation of limestone, pozzolana, slag, tuff and dust electrostatic precipitator (<b>crushed</b> <b>finely)</b> like active addition in the matric E of cement, its effect on the behavior and ageing of cement S made up and on the microstructure of the concrete by a structural characterization by XR...|$|R

50|$|It is {{primarily}} made from <b>finely</b> <b>crushed</b> shrimp or krill mixed with salt, and then fermented for several weeks. Some versions are in its wet form {{such as those}} in Vietnam and other versions are sun-dried and either cut into rectangular blocks or sold in bulk. It is an essential ingredient in many curries and sauces. Shrimp paste can be found in most meals in Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines. It is often an ingredient in dip for fish or vegetables.|$|E
50|$|Rough-outs are {{glued to}} a metal chuck {{and turned on}} a lathe, {{sometimes}} using pieces of broken grinding wheels. The chuck is removed by heating the glue, or — if the operator is inclined — a sharp tap on the chuck with a spanner. A further resining stage may take place, before the piece is returned to the lathe and polished with wet abrasive paper. A final high polish is added using putty powder (<b>finely</b> <b>crushed</b> tin dioxide) applied with a moist piece of felt.|$|E
50|$|The overall thermal {{efficiency}} of TOSCO II process is low because {{the energy of}} spent shale is not recovered {{and much of the}} produced shale gas is consumed by the process itself. The efficiency could be increased by burning char (carbonaceous residue in the spent shale) instead of shale gas as a fuel of the ball heater. The process' other disadvantages are mechanical complexity and large number of moving parts. Also the lifetime of ceramic balls is limited. Disposal of spent shale includes environmental problems because it is very <b>finely</b> <b>crushed</b> and contains carbon residue.|$|E
50|$|Females {{are larger}} {{and have a}} more rounded abdomen than the males. When {{attempting}} to breed them, a separate breeding tank should be set up with slightly acidic, very soft water (4 dGH or below). The Red-eye tetra is free spawning but will also lay eggs among the roots of floating plants.Once spawning has occurred, the mating pair should be removed, as they will consume the eggs and hatching fry. One day after they are laid, the eggs will hatch. The fry can initially be fed infusoria, rotifers, or commercially prepared fry foods, then freshly hatched brine shrimp, and eventually <b>finely</b> <b>crushed</b> flake foods.|$|E
50|$|Another West African people {{known to}} produce powder glass beads are the Yoruba from Nigeria. Beads from their {{production}} differ technically from typical Ghanaian powder glass beads {{in that they}} are not made in molds and in the wet-core technique. <b>Finely</b> <b>crushed</b> glass is moistened with water and shaped by hand. The perforations are made before the beads are fired, using a pointed tool. So-called Ateyun beads were made in different shapes but always in red, to imitate real Mediterranean coral. Genuine coral was rare, but very much sought after and highly valued by the Yoruba people. Yoruba bead makers made their own imitations at more affordable prices.|$|E
50|$|Pâte de verre {{is a form}} of kiln casting and {{literally}} translated means glass paste. In this process, <b>finely</b> <b>crushed</b> glass is mixed with a binding material, such as a mixture of gum arabic and water, and often with colourants and enamels. The resultant paste is applied to the inner surface of a negative mould forming a coating. After the coated mould is fired at the appropriate temperature the glass is fused creating a hollow object that can have thick or thin walls depending on the thickness of the pate de verre layers. Daum, a French commercial crystal manufacturer, produce highly sculptural pieces in pate de verre.|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} properties of coke are ash and sulfur content, which {{are dependent on}} the coal used for production. Coke with less ash and sulfur content is highly priced on the market. Other important characteristics are the M10, M25, and M40 test crush indexes, which convey the strength of coke during transportation into the blast furnaces; depending on blast furnaces size, <b>finely</b> <b>crushed</b> coke pieces must not be allowed into the blast furnaces because they would impede the flow of gas through the charge of iron and coke. A related characteristic is the Coke Strength After Reaction (CSR) index; it represents coke's ability to withstand the violent conditions inside the blast furnace before turning into fine particles.|$|E
50|$|<b>Finely</b> <b>crushed</b> {{dolomite}} lime stone, sieved {{sand and}} clay provided the bonding material for the bricks. The clay employed was pliable and thus accommodates movement within the structure. One of {{the sides of the}} brick was roughened to trap the bonding slurry thus limiting lateral movement. The stupa was then covered with lime plaster; the plaster used contained seashells, sugar syrup, egg whites, coconut water, glues, oils, plant resin, sand, clay and pebbles. The plaster also provided waterproofing for the structure. The Mahavamsa also mentions the use of copper sheets over the foundation and arsenic dissolved in sesame oil to prevent insect and plant intrusions inside the stupa. It is estimated that Jetavanaramaya took 15 years to complete and would have required a skillful workforce of hundreds, including brickyard workers and bricklayers, and stonemasons.|$|E
5000|$|... "Fast/dry" [...] {{courts are}} a {{relatively}} new innovation from America. These are generally made from basalt taken from the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, which is then <b>finely</b> <b>crushed</b> and used as the top layer over either a purpose built sub-layer or just placed {{on top of an}} existing clay or asphalt surface. This type of surface is promoted as allowing more [...] "sliding" [...] by the players and therefore it helps to limit tennis injuries to the lower parts of the body. These courts are typically slower than grass. They can dry very quickly and do not have the heat reflection problems of clay courts. Porosity is low and often these courts have a slight slope to aid water run off. They are similar to the basic clay courts described above.|$|E
