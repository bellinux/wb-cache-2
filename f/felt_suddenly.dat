2500|$|Bryant {{sold the}} Copping farm for $143,000 {{and kept the}} Hobart mansion. While living at Copping, the white {{overalls}} he habitually wore were replaced with clothing {{more in line with}} Harvey's financial status. Now that he was alone, his dress became more bizarre. He often wore a grey linen suit, cravat, lizard skin shoes and a Panama hat while carrying a briefcase during the day, telling anyone who would listen that he had a well-paying career. He often wore an electric blue suit with flared trousers and a ruffled shirt to the restaurant he frequented. The restaurant owner recalled: [...] "It was horrible. Everyone was laughing at him, even the customers. I really <b>felt</b> <b>suddenly</b> quite sorry for him. I realised this guy didn't really have any friends." ...|$|E
2500|$|Novello {{continued}} to write songs while {{serving in the}} RNAS. He had his first stage success with Theodore & Co in 1916, a production by George Grossmith, Jr. and Edward Laurillard with a score composed by Novello and the young Jerome Kern. In the same year, Novello contributed to André Charlot's revue See-Saw. In 1917 he wrote for another Grossmith and Laurillard production, the operette Arlette, for which he contributed additional numbers to an existing French score by Jane Vieu and Guy le Feuvre. In the same year, Marsh {{introduced him to the}} actor Bobbie Andrews, who became Novello's life partner. Andrews introduced Novello to the young Noël Coward. Coward, six years Novello's junior, was deeply envious of Novello's effortless glamour. He wrote, [...] "I just <b>felt</b> <b>suddenly</b> conscious of the long way I had to go before I could break into the magic atmosphere in which he moved and breathed with such nonchalance".|$|E
60|$|The hand which Bianca {{placed in}} it was feverishly hot. Stephen <b>felt</b> <b>suddenly</b> compunctious.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned her}} dark eyes upon him. He <b>felt</b> himself <b>suddenly</b> embarrassed.|$|R
60|$|Barnes <b>felt</b> himself <b>suddenly</b> grow hot {{and then}} cold. The {{perspiration}} stood out upon his forehead.|$|R
60|$|Saton {{gripped the}} sides of his seat. He <b>felt</b> himself <b>suddenly</b> choking. He rose and turned away.|$|R
60|$|Helène {{raised her}} eyes and looked at her. The other girl <b>felt</b> <b>suddenly</b> very insignificant.|$|E
60|$|And, {{seeing her}} smile, he <b>felt</b> <b>suddenly</b> relieved. She was really {{glad to see}} him, perhaps.|$|E
60|$|Jacob <b>felt</b> <b>suddenly</b> soothed. Lady Mary {{was looking}} very {{attractive}} {{and her eyes}} were full of challenge.|$|E
60|$|DOLPHIN. To-night {{was one of}} my {{moments of}} triumph. I <b>felt</b> myself <b>suddenly</b> free of all my inhibitions.|$|R
6000|$|Duncombe <b>felt</b> himself <b>suddenly</b> precipitated {{into a new}} world--a {{nightmare}} of horrors. He was no stranger in the city, and grim possibilities unfolded themselves before his eyes. Four nights ago! ...|$|R
60|$|Maraton <b>felt</b> himself <b>suddenly</b> at {{the edge}} of the world. He leaned over and looked into the abyss called hell. For a moment he shivered; then he set his teeth.|$|R
60|$|Cecilia <b>felt</b> <b>suddenly</b> {{as though}} the world were {{listening}} to her conversation with these two rather seedy persons.|$|E
60|$|Agatha <b>felt</b> <b>suddenly</b> {{dazed and}} dizzy, for {{she knew what}} {{the answer to that}} {{question}} must be even before Mrs. Hastings spoke.|$|E
60|$|Susie <b>felt</b> <b>suddenly</b> sick at heart. She {{had never}} dreamt that her secret was discovered. Margaret gave a bitter little laugh and walked past her.|$|E
60|$|He leaned {{a little}} closer, and she <b>suddenly</b> <b>felt</b> her hand clasped in his.|$|R
60|$|Crawshay <b>felt</b> himself <b>suddenly</b> {{back again}} {{in the world of}} real happenings. His {{depression}} passed as though by magic. After all, he had won the first trick, and the next move was already forming up in his mind.|$|R
60|$|At this supreme {{moment of}} perplexity he <b>suddenly</b> <b>felt</b> a respectful touch on his arm.|$|R
60|$|Maraton {{moved in}} his chair a little uneasily. He <b>felt</b> <b>suddenly</b> {{as though he were}} a {{prisoner}} at the bar, and this man his judge.|$|E
60|$|George <b>felt</b> <b>suddenly</b> sick. He turned away. He {{did not see}} {{his brother}} enter the thicket, but he heard the passage of his body through the leaves and branches.|$|E
60|$|He {{spoke as}} fast as anybody! He had dark lively little eyes, too, all crinkled round like a Catholic priest's. Winifred <b>felt</b> <b>suddenly</b> he might say things she would regret.|$|E
60|$|We halted {{upon the}} steps, and I <b>felt</b> Cavalcanti's hand <b>suddenly</b> tighten upon my arm.|$|R
60|$|Her face crimsoned, {{which was}} not quite what he had expected, and he <b>suddenly</b> <b>felt</b> embarrassed.|$|R
60|$|She <b>felt</b> a hand <b>suddenly</b> tighten {{upon her}} arm, a hand which {{was like a}} vice.|$|R
6000|$|... "No wonder," [...] {{returned}} Neale, and he <b>felt</b> <b>suddenly</b> {{the fiery}} grip {{of his old}} state of mind toward all the engineering obstacles. [...] "I'm going out {{to look over the}} ground." ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>felt</b> <b>suddenly</b> {{ashamed of}} myself. I may say truly that I understood--and my {{hesitation}} in letting that man swim {{away from my}} ship's side had been a mere sham sentiment, a sort of cowardice.|$|E
60|$|She assented, {{not liking}} to confess {{that she did}} not know what Chardonnet might be, and hoping {{it was some kind of}} sherbet. She had never yet drunk wine, and after a glass <b>felt</b> <b>suddenly</b> {{extremely}} strong.|$|E
60|$|The {{sight of}} the sharp-pointed shears was not a {{pleasant}} one, and when the wild man invited him to sit down Dave felt very much like running away. The man evidently saw how he <b>felt,</b> and <b>suddenly</b> caught him by the arm.|$|R
5000|$|Lap 10: Reb Wickersham <b>suddenly</b> <b>felt</b> nasty {{vibrations}} {{coming out}} of his vehicle, exiting the race for safety purposes ...|$|R
60|$|They had paused by {{the side}} of an arbour. She <b>suddenly</b> <b>felt</b> the {{pressure}} of his fingers upon her hand.|$|R
60|$|Maraton <b>felt</b> <b>suddenly</b> {{a twinge}} of {{something}} I which was almost compunction. Mr. Foley's face was white and tired. He had {{the air of a}} man oppressed with anxieties which he was doing his best to conceal.|$|E
60|$|Hearing {{her fears}} confirmed, and in {{accordance}} with the secret vein of hardness which kept her living, amid all her sympathies and hesitations, Cecilia <b>felt</b> <b>suddenly</b> that she had gone as far as it was in her to go.|$|E
60|$|She <b>felt</b> <b>suddenly</b> afraid, but thrilled when he {{took the}} belt roughly from her, thrilled to the roughness. She looked at him softly, and was aware of a pain at the breast and of small hands {{clutching}} her throat.|$|E
60|$|She hesitated. He <b>suddenly</b> <b>felt</b> {{her hand}} grow colder in his. He saw her frame shiver beneath its weight of furs.|$|R
60|$|We {{were walking}} very close together. I <b>felt</b> her fingers <b>suddenly</b> upon {{my arm and}} her soft breath upon my cheek.|$|R
60|$|Kate turned {{round with}} a little laugh of contempt. Jeanne <b>felt</b> herself <b>suddenly</b> lifted {{in a pair of}} strong arms. Before she knew where she was she was on the other side. Breathless she {{followed}} her guide, who came to a full stop a few yards farther on.|$|R
