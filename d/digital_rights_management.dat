40|$|In recent years, the {{information}} protection for digital contents becomes {{an important issue}} for enterprise applications. To protect digital contents, various enterprise <b>digital</b> <b>right</b> <b>management</b> (E-DRM) schemes have been proposed to prevent the digital contents from illegal accesses. However, the previously related schemes {{did not support the}} <b>digital</b> <b>right</b> <b>management</b> for multi-user environments. In addition, these schemes are insecure in some applications. To overcome the above problems, we propose a new group-oriented E-DRM scheme with reliable and flexible access policies in this paper. The proposed scheme allows multiple users to acquire the access right, which can be dynamically determined according to the enterprise policy. In addition, no one can access the digital contents except authorized users. Compared with the related works, the proposed scheme is more reliable and flexible for enterprise applications...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Digital watermarks (DWM) {{refer to}} {{embedding}} additional information directly into audio signal for <b>digital</b> <b>right</b> <b>management</b> and automatic identification of radiotelephone transmissions in aeronautical, maritime and military VHF communication. The main part. The designed embedding algorithm {{is based on}} evaluation of sliding frame to embed information or no regarding to distortions introduced by DWM. Watermark location is grounded calculation of distances norm between received and maximum likelihood estimated signal vectors {{in the domain of}} Discreet Fourier Transform and doesn?t need for any marking and synchronizing measures. Robustness of DWM against quantization, filtering, additive Gaussian noise, digital format conversion is provided by multichannel narrowband DWM transmission and application of BCH (63, 30, 6) error-correction code. The proposed algorithm demonstrates watermark inaudibility because of preserving signal power before and after data embedding and searching the most suitable frames for DWM positioning. Conclusion. The proposed algorithms provide advanced compromising solution of audio watermarking process: data payload ? inaudibility ? robustness. The designed algorithms are applicable both in analog and digital channels for transmission monitoring and <b>digital</b> <b>right</b> <b>management.</b> ??????????? ????????? ??????????? ? ??????????? ???????? ??????? ?????? ? ???????? ??????? ?? ?????? ??????? ??????????? ?????? ? ????????? ???????. ????????? ???????????? ??????????? ????????? ???????, ??????????? ? ????????????? ??? ? ??????????? ?????? ??? ????????????? ?????-???? ???????? ? ??????????????. ??? ??????????? ?????????????????? ??? ????????? ???????????? ?????????????? ???????? ? ???????????????? ???????????...|$|R
