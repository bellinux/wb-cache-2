25|$|As Mk. <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> the field, {{a number}} of {{improvements}} in the basic electronics were introduced. These were collected together to form the Mk. I* version. The differences between the Mk. I and Mk. I* were primarily in details. It was found that in certain orientations of the transmitter and receiver, the small antenna used to trigger the time base would see too small a signal to work. This {{was replaced by a}} cable between the two cabins, which was known as cable locking. Certain details of the RF stages on the receiver improved signal-to-noise ratio, a voltage regulator was added to correct for differences in generators, and a new system was introduced that replaced the complex grounding system for the potentiometer with an electronic version. A more major change was the introduction of anti-jamming features.|$|E
25|$|Between 7 and 12 June 1713, {{the fleet}} was visited by Peter I, who brought 8 ships and a {{battalion}} of Preobrazhensky Regiment. Peter stayed on Poltava and inspected the fleet. On 2 July 1713, a Swedish squadron of Vice Admiral Lile (9 ships and two frigates) arrived to Helsinki, which was besieged by Russian troops. On 5 July, 3 more Swedish ships of the line blockaded Revel (now Tallinn) which then hosted five Russian warships recently purchased abroad. After receiving the news, on 4 July Peter <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> Kronstadt and raised his flag on Poltava. On 7 July, he ordered Cruys with his squadron to relieve the siege of Revel. On 9 July, together with 12 other ships Poltava left Kronstadt heading for the Revel. In the evening of 10 July {{the vanguard of the}} squadron spotted the three Swedish ships at the island of Gogland and began chasing them. However, the next morning the three Russian front ships, Vyborg, Riga and frigate Esperanza run aground and the Swedish ships managed to join the squadron of Lile at Helsinki. Poltava was part of the vanguard, but avoided being stranded. On 16 July, it reached Revel, joined the Russian ships there, and together they returned to Kronstadt on 25 July.|$|E

Legal documents were still written in the latter's name; however, Ibrahim Pasha became the de facto ruler of the country from this moment on. On 20 July of the same year, an extraordinary envoy of Ottoman Sultan Abdülmecid <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> Alexandria with the firman by which the Porte recognized Ibrahim Pasha as Egypt's new wāli. The latter then travelled to Istanbul, where his investiture took place on 25 August {{in the presence of}} the Ottoman Sultan. However, his reign was very brief, and his death occurred shortly after his return to Cairo. He died on 10 November 1848 due to ill health, thus predeceasing his father.|$|E

2500|$|After his crash at Spa, Stewart {{became an}} outspoken {{advocate}} for auto racing safety. Later, he explained, [...] "If I have any legacy {{to leave the}} sport I {{hope it will be}} seen to be an area of safety because when <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> Grand Prix racing so-called precautions and safety measures were diabolical." [...] By Stewart's reckoning, a driver who raced for five years had a two-thirds chance of being killed in a crash.|$|E
2500|$|I kept {{up playing}} drums until I moved to London. I'd {{always wanted to}} be a good drummer and it's just ironic that I've turned out to be a bass player. The way I started playing bass was that when <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> London I was looking for a job, and the only place I could find one was in Macaris in Charing Cross Rd. I wanted to get {{something}} involved in music, and that seemed like a good place to be. But Macaris didn't sell drums, and so I lied and said I could play bass. They said, [...] "Fine, you sell the basses, and sweep up and get the coffees and whatever".|$|E

2500|$|His {{former coach}} Dan Reeves said about Gradishar, [...] "He {{was as good}} a linebacker as I have ever been around, and I have been around some great ones. He was a leader without {{question}} of our defense while I was with Denver. He was an exceptional football player. I {{had a great deal}} of respect for him when I was at Dallas before I ever went to Denver. After <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> Denver and saw what kind of a leader he was my respect for him grew. He never missed a game and was a dominant force on the field. The opposing team always had to take him into account when they devised their game plans." ...|$|E
2500|$|The country's {{designation}} as Siam by Westerners likely {{came from}} the Portuguese, the first Europeans to give a coherent account of the country. Portuguese chronicles noted that the Borommatrailokkanat, king of the Ayutthaya Kingdom, sent an expedition to the Malacca Sultanate at {{the southern tip of}} the Malay Peninsula in 1455. Following their conquest of Malacca in 1511, the Portuguese sent a diplomatic mission to Ayutthaya. A century later, on 15 August 1612, The Globe, an East India Company merchantman bearing a letter from King James <b>I,</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> [...] "the Road of Syam". [...] "By the end of the 19th century, Siam had become so enshrined in geographical nomenclature that it was believed that by this name and no other would it continue to be known and styled." ...|$|E
2500|$|Actor Nick Berry {{was cast}} to play Wicksy with minimal delay. Smith has {{described}} his casting {{as one of}} the fastest on record. [...] Berry auditioned in front of the soap's creators, Smith and Tony Holland, and was offered the part immediately. Berry was whisked into costume and make-up and given a new haircut, which Berry claimed was because the producers wanted to smarten his appearance up. Berry was already a fan of the soap {{at the time of his}} casting. He has told interviewer Dan Abramson, [...] "I auditioned on a Wednesday and then on Friday <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> Albert Square and began shooting my first scenes with Dirty Den, whom I had enjoyed watching on the box for some time. For my first few episodes, I walked around with a big smile on my face, grinning at everybody. It was funny." ...|$|E

2500|$|Collins: He {{was on the}} {{dockside}} with Anne, his daughter[...] [...] [...]. I think <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> April and I don't {{think we}} went south until August. It took {{quite a long time}} to get the money together; it kept falling through. I think Columbia was going to pay for it at one point, but they insisted he have a union engineer with him and someone extra like that—in situations we were going to be in would have been hopeless. So he refused, and they withdrew their funding. It was very last minute that the Ertegun brothers at Atlantic gave us the cash and we were gone within days of getting that money. Alan had wanted to do it earlier, but there was just no money to do it with. He had no money, ever. He was always living hand to mouth.|$|E
2500|$|Newly crowned {{champion}} di Grassi said of {{his title}} success, [...] "This journey, this day started {{three years ago when}} we started season one, and then {{we got a lot of}} good results. <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> London fighting for the championship, even though I got disqualified from winning a race. Season two, the same situation, even got disqualified from winning a race. Finally I came here as an underdog, 10 points behind and had the nerves to keep calm, I did the job yesterday and today managed to win it also. I’m so happy for my team, so happy for the ABT Schaeffler Audi Sport guys, they really deserve it." [...] He later claimed to have not given up hope in winning the championship despite a competitive field and retiring from the Paris ePrix, but also admitted that focusing on Formula E after Audi's withdrawal from the World Endurance Championship at the end of 2016 aided his title effort. While Buemi admitted his disappointment in losing the championship, he congratulated di Grassi on securing the accolade, and stated him missing the New York City races was not an excuse in his loss. Regarding his pit stop early in the race, Buemi chose not to judge if the stewards made the correct decision and admitted not knowing about the regulation that required him to enter the pit lane because of car damage.|$|E
