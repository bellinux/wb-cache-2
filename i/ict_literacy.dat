40|$|This {{paper will}} present a {{taxonomy}} of curricular goals aimed at developing <b>ICT</b> <b>literacies.</b> The taxonomy originates from a theoretical perspective that sees <b>ICT</b> <b>literacies</b> {{in terms of social}} practice and a changing discourse about communication. Specifically, the paper will report how the texonomy has been applied to the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) curriculum in Japan where efforts are underway to move ICT as a subject area in secondary schools into the elementary and middle schools. However, the goal is to fully integrate ICT into a program of <b>ICT</b> <b>literacies</b> across the curriculum. The taxonomy represents a framework for doing so, recognizing that many teachers are not consciously aware of <b>ICT</b> <b>literacies,</b> or even if they are awarc of it. they cannot conceptualize how it might be integrated meaningfully into the curricullum. To illustrate how the framework might be applied, data from some instances at Japanese school will be presented. The teacher who is the focus of the instances is an expert teacher who at the time of data collection had begum to use multi-media but had little awareness of or commitment to <b>ICT</b> <b>literacies.</b> The teachers shift toward an awareness of <b>ICT</b> <b>literacies</b> will be presented in light of the taxonomy presented {{at the outset of the}} paper...|$|R

40|$|About the book: This {{authoritative}} landmark text {{examines the}} highly topical and important issue of <b>ICT</b> in <b>literacy</b> learning. Its distinctive focus on providing a systematic review {{of research in}} the field gives the reader an essential, comprehensive overview. As governments worldwide continue to invest heavily in ICT provisions in educational institutions, this book addresses the need to gather and synthesise evidence about the impact of <b>ICT</b> on <b>literacy</b> learning. An expert team of writers draw upon two recent reports by the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, which highlighted the considerable differences between nations in the access and use of ICT, to take a discursive and expansive look at the subject. Within its wide range and scope, chapters cover areas on: * the history of <b>literacy</b> and <b>ICT</b> * evidence for the effectiveness of <b>ICT</b> on <b>literacy</b> learning * the impact of networked <b>ICT</b> on <b>literacy</b> learning * the relationship between verbal and visual literacies. This book will be an invaluable and informative read with international resonance for student teachers, teachers, academics and researchers worldwide...|$|R

40|$|This article {{argues that}} {{we have come to}} a {{crossroads}} in research in the relationship of information and communication technologies (<b>ICT)</b> and <b>literacy</b> development. To date, research and evaluation have tried to gauge the impact of <b>ICT</b> on <b>literacy.</b> Predictably, <b>ICT</b> had been found to produce positive effects, though often these are small and/or specific. A systematic review of research on the topic is cited and a distillation of its results presented. However, the question of impact seems to miss a more important point: that the relationship between <b>ICT</b> and <b>literacy</b> (or literacies) is symbiotic. Questions are asked in the paper about how best to research such symbiosis, and a number of case studies are cited as evidence that a modest, descriptive and analytical approach is, at present, best suited to research in the field at this time. Two further issues follow from the above reorientation: the first {{is that we need to}} give more consideration to an understanding of the power of the visual and its relation to the verbal code, as this issue is fundamental to reading and composing on-screen; and the second is that it is not so much the new technologies themselves as the communities they enable young people to create and establish that are important for thinking about literacy development...|$|R

40|$|The broad {{background}} to this review {{is that there}} is a growing concern internationally that the investment in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in schools is not impacting on literacy development. This concern arises from a belief held by many – including governments as well as schools – that ICT is beneficial to learning and specifically literacy learning. The question is a specific one and has to be seen within a wider political, social and technological context in which the symbiosis between new technologies and new literacies (and thus literacy learning) is acknowledged. In this systematic in-depth review of the impact of <b>ICT</b> on literature-related <b>literacies</b> in English, 5 - 16, Locke and Andrews set out to determine – as far as they could, given the range of research available and the conceptual complexities of the field – the nature of the impact of what have become known as new technologies within a wider notion of the symbiosis between <b>ICT</b> and <b>literacies.</b> The background anticipates that research studies of the impact of <b>ICT</b> on literature-related <b>literacies</b> are thin on the ground. It sets out key definitions and explores the conceptual issues in the present review, supplementing the generic part of the report in this regard. It also summarises briefly the policy, practice and research background.
