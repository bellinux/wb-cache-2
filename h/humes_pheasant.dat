40|$|Major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) genes {{are the most}} polymorphic genes in verte-brates and encode molecules that {{play a crucial role}} in pathogen resistance. As a result of their diversity, they have received much attention in the fields of evolutionary and conserva-tion biology. Here, we described the genetic variation of MHC class II B (MHCIIB) exon 2 in a wild population of <b>Hume’s</b> <b>pheasant</b> (Syrmaticus humiae), which has suffered a dramatic decline in population over the last three decades across its ranges in the face of heavy ex-ploitation and habitat loss. Twenty-four distinct alleles were found in 73 S. humiae speci-mens. We found seven shared alleles among four geographical groups as well as six rare MHCIIB alleles. Most individuals displayed between one to five alleles, suggesting that there are at least three MHCIIB loci of the <b>Hume’s</b> <b>pheasant.</b> The dN ⁄ dS ratio at putative an-tigen-binding sites (ABS) was significantly greater than one, indicating balancing selection is acting on MHCIIB exon 2. Additionally, recombination and gene conversion contributed to generating MHCIIB diversity in the <b>Hume’s</b> <b>pheasant.</b> One to three recombination events and seventy-five significant gene conversion events were observed within the <b>Hume’s</b> <b>pheasant</b> MHCIIB loci. The phylogenetic tree and network analysis revealed that the <b>Hume’s</b> <b>pheasant</b> alleles do not cluster together, but are scattered through the tree or net-work indicating a trans-species evolutionary mode. These findings revealed the evolution of the <b>Hume’s</b> <b>pheasant</b> MHC after suffering extreme habitat fragmentation...|$|R

5000|$|Perhaps {{the white}} wing-band was already present by that time; as the copper {{pheasant}} has a highly apomorphic coloration with reduced sexual dimorphism, {{it may well}} have lost such a trait after it settled Japan. But it might also have evolved only after the copper pheasant ancestors had split {{from those of the}} species displaying the wing-band today. However that may be, the minor plumage differences of the wing-banded species suggest that their last common ancestor looked almost identical to the living Mrs. <b>Hume's</b> <b>pheasant</b> (S. humiae). At some point during the Pliocene [...] - [...] probably around 2.8 mya during the Piacenzian [...] - [...] the ancestors of the Mikado pheasant (S. mikado) settled Taiwan, apparently during the period when that island separated from the mainland and alternated between being a peninsula and an island for some time. They were finally isolated no later than the Late Pliocene; the species is melanistic, suggesting a small founder population. The adjacent mainland population split into the subtropical and partially leucistic Elliot's pheasant (S. ellioti) and the tropical Mrs. <b>Hume's</b> <b>pheasant</b> only in the Middle Pleistocene, around half a million years ago. This divergence was probably in some way connected to climate changes at the Günz-Mindel interglacial to Mindel boundary, when mountains in the region became dry and at times icebound. The Nanling Mountains region marks the present-day boundary between these sister species and is not inhabited by either.|$|R

50|$|Mizoram is a {{state in}} the {{northeast}} of India. Mizoram {{is considered by many}} as a beautiful place due to its dramatic landscape and pleasant climate. There have been many attempts to increase revenue through tourism but many potential tourists find the lack of amenities to be a hurdle. However, the State continues to promote itself and many projects have been initiated. The tourism ministry continues to maintain or upgrade its tourist lodges throughout the state. Foreign tourists are required to obtain an 'inner line permit' under the special permit before visiting. The permit can be obtained from Indian missions abroad for a limited number of days or direct from Mizoram Government authorities within India. The state is rich in bird diversity, which has the potentiality to make it a major birding destination. For Mrs <b>Hume's</b> <b>pheasant</b> (Syrmaticus humiae), Mizoram is a stronghold. There is also a rare record of the wild water buffalo from the state. There are several past records of the Sumatran rhinoceros from Mizoram, then Lushai Hills.
