5|$|Prairie Avenue {{once served}} as an Indian trail linking Fort Dearborn to Fort Wayne in Indiana and thus derived {{its name from the}} vast midwestern prairie land between the two endpoints. In 1812, the Battle of Fort Dearborn {{occurred}} in the area that is now the northern section of the street, in {{what is known as the}} Near South Side community area. Casualties of the battle, such as William Wells and George Ronan, were struck <b>down</b> <b>here.</b>|$|E

25|$|Coimbatore cuisine is {{predominantly}} south Indian with rice as its base. Most locals still retain their rural flavour, with many restaurants serving food over a banana leaf. North Indian, Chinese and continental cuisines are also available. Mysore pak (a sweet made from lentil flour and ghee), idly, dosa, Halwa (a sweet made of different ingredients like milk, wheat, rice). The Annapoorna Gowrishankar Hotels in Coimbatore {{are known for}} its unique taste of Sambar. Biryani is also popular among the locals. Apart from this Coimbatore has a very active street food culture, thanks to the migratory North Indian population that settled <b>down</b> <b>here</b> a few generation ago. Kaalaan is a dish that originated in Coimbatore and is prepared by simmering deep fried mushrooms (usually chopped mushroom) in a spicy broth, until it reaches a porridge like consistency and served sprinkled with chopped onions and coriander leaves.|$|E
25|$|After {{a year at}} Bonn, Heine left to {{continue}} his law studies at the University of Göttingen. Heine hated the town. It was part of Hanover, ruled by the King of England, the power Heine blamed for bringing Napoleon <b>down.</b> <b>Here</b> the poet experienced an aristocratic snobbery absent elsewhere. He also hated law as the Historical School of law he had to study was used to bolster the reactionary form of government he opposed. Other events conspired to make Heine loathe this period of his life: he was expelled from a student fraternity for anti-Semitic reasons and he heard the news that his cousin Amalie had become engaged. When Heine challenged another student, Wiebel, to a duel (the first of ten known incidents throughout his life), the authorities stepped in and Heine was suspended from the university for six months. His uncle now decided {{to send him to}} the University of Berlin.|$|E

25|$|Kalas awakens in Mintaka, the Imperial capital, and {{receives}} both his Winglet and his guardian spirit back from Xelha. He also {{takes on the}} role of world-saving hero with greater enthusiasm than before, feeling he must make amends for deceiving his friends. After this, Mizuti directs the group to the lands below the Taintclouds, a poisonous layer of gas {{at the bottom of the}} sky. The atmosphere down there has become breathable over a thousand years, but this was not always the case. Due to this, the people who lived down there wore masks which could filter the air and make it possible to breathe. They also do not know when the air became safe to breathe. It is <b>down</b> <b>here</b> that the gang learn about the Sword of the Heavens, and that this area is Mizuti's homeland. Sadly, the Sword of the Heavens had been stolen by Krumly, who resented the role of guardians that the children of the Earth have inherited for generations. He therefore attempted a ritual to a pierce a hole in the Taintcoluds and beg Malpercio to release the children of the Earth from their duty. This turns out to be a mistake as Melodia and Malpercio rampage through Krumly's village. The village is saved by a last minute intervention from Kalas and the gang, but the Sword of the Heavens is broken.|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1840, Balzac had a {{discussion}} with his friend Léon Gozlan {{about the power of}} a person's name. In his comic essay Balzac en pantoufles, Gozlan recounted his associate's insistence: [...] ("We are named up there [...] before being named <b>down</b> <b>here.</b> It's a mystery to which it's not suitable to apply, for the sake of understanding, the little rules of our slight reasoning.") ...|$|E

500|$|Animosity {{between the}} British and the Boers {{intensified}} {{in the run-up}} to the Second Boer War fought from 1899 to 1902, and continued thereafter. One British volunteer soldier sent home a letter explicitly detailing the British soldiers' hatred of their Boer enemy: [...] "The Cape Dutch and Boers are a dirty treacherous lot and as soon as the Transvaal is subdued and the beggars (those that survive) trek farther out of our way the better. We do hate them <b>down</b> <b>here</b> like poison. The rascally dirty varmints, they must be exterminated; the country swarms with them and their dirty compatriots the German Jew." ...|$|E
500|$|In May, {{the detective}} William J. Burns {{traveled}} to Atlanta to offer further {{assistance in the}} case. However, his Burns Agency withdrew from the case later that month. C. W. Tobie, a detective from the Chicago affiliate who {{was assigned to the}} case, said that the agency [...] "came <b>down</b> <b>here</b> to investigate a murder case, not to engage in petty politic." [...] The agency quickly became disillusioned with the many societal implications of the case, most notably the notion that Frank was able to evade prosecution due to his being a rich Jew, buying off the police and paying for private detectives.|$|E
500|$|Myers {{obtained}} the coaching job at his alma mater, Centre College, and brought all the above-named players with him. McMillin and Weaver {{did not have}} sufficient high-school credits to enter college and enrolled at Somerset High School for the 1916-17 year, playing with Red Roberts. [...] "I've got a boy under my wing <b>down</b> <b>here</b> in Texas who's a football-playing fool and I {{want him to go}} to Centre.

500|$|The {{exterior}} freighter {{scenes were}} filmed on an actual freighter, while interior scenes were filmed both on sets {{and in the}} freighter. The production crew had intended for the engine room scene where Michael goes to detonate the bomb and sees Libby to be shot in the freighter's engine room; instead, they built a new engine room set based on that inside the freighter. It was [...] "so stifling hot" [...] at around [...] and the crew found that [...] "to get air conditioning <b>down</b> <b>here</b> … was an impossible task", according to the Kahanas real life chief engineer Bob Bower. Sculptor Jim Van Houten created twin twenty four foot (seven meter) marine engines for the set, primarily from urethane foam.|$|E
500|$|Kimball's {{first years}} as an apostle were {{dominated}} by World War II. Kimball often encouraged American church members to purchase war bonds to support the war effort, which they would {{then be able to}} cash out after the war and use the accumulated interest to send the returned soldiers on their LDS missions. Kimball lamented the global destruction of World War II and once wrote in his journal, [...] "How outraged the Lord must feel to see His children fighting <b>down</b> <b>here</b> like wild beasts." [...] As the keynote speaker at BYU's 1944 baccalaureate service, Kimball publicly criticized members of Allied nations for concentrating on [...] "the tyranny and shackles of [...] nations {{and at the same time}} [...] in bondage individually to sin." ...|$|E

We were sitting in position and just didn't do it. This thing only comes around once a year, so I'll think about it until we throw the checkered flag on next year's Daytona 500.
