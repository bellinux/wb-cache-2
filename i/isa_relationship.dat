40|$|Semi-structured {{data has}} become {{prevalent}} {{with the growth}} of the Internet. The data is usually stored in a traditional database system or in a specialized repository. While many information providers have presented their databases on the web as semi-structured data, other information providers are developing repositories for new application. One such application is e-commerce, which is emerging as a major web-supported application assisting business transactions between multiple parties via the network and involving large amounts of data. Designing a "good" semi-structured database is increasingly crucial to prevent data redundancy, inconsistency and updating anomalies. In this paper, we propose a conceptual approach to design semi-structured databases. A conceptual layer which is based on the popular Entity-Relationship (ER) model is employed to remove anomalies and redundancies at the semantic level. An algorithm to map an ER diagram involving composite attributes weak entity types, recursive, n-ary and <b>ISA</b> <b>relationship</b> sets, and aggregations to a semi-structured schema graph (S 3 -Graph) used to represent semi-structured data is given. Our study reveals similarities between the S 3 -Graph and the hierarchical model and nested relations in that all have limitations in modeling situations with nonhierarchical relationships given their tree-like structures...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOne of {{the central}} {{concepts}} supported by object-oriented databases is <b>isa</b> <b>relationship.</b> Its intuitive simplicity is deceptive. In reality, this term denotes several concepts, such as subtyping, subset relationships, and inheritance of structure and/or behavior. Each of these is non-trivial, and their interaction may be quite subtle. This paper deals with subtyping and its properties, {{in the context of}} a model that allows arbitrary data types and type constructors (but no function constructor). For simplicity a model based on the algebraic specification approach is used, which partially explains the inability to deal with the function constructor. Two intuitive ideas about subtyping are generalized and investigated: first, that the set of elements associated with a subtype is a subset of the set associated with supertype, and second, that each element of the subtype may be used in any place where an element of the supertype is expected. A generalized subtyping relation among abstract data types is defined, and its properties are investigated. In particular, it is shown that often there exist many possible subtyping relations among two types and that testing for some desirable properties, such as correctness, is in general undecidable. The notion of natural subtyping relation (that is related to parametric abstract data types) is introduced and shown to have a simple correctness proof. The paper concludes with a generalized type checking algorithm...|$|E

This poses problems for specifying more complete taxonomic relationships as well as for denotational semantics in sorted logic.

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} the computational complexity of reasoning over various {{fragments of the}} Extended Entity-Relationship (EER) language, which includes a number of constructs: ISA between entities and relationships, disjointness and covering of entities and relationships, cardinality constraints for entities in relationships and their refinements as well as multiplicity constraints for attributes. We extend the known EXPTIME-completeness result for UML class diagrams [5] and show that reasoning over EER diagrams with <b>ISA</b> between <b>relationships</b> is EXPTIME-complete even without relationship covering. Surprisingly, reasoning becomes NP-complete when we drop <b>ISA</b> between <b>relationships</b> (while still allowing all types of constraints on entities). If we further omit disjointness and covering over entities, reasoning becomes polynomial.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a conceptually simple {{structural}} object model focusing on object types, attributes and <b>ISA</b> <b>relationships</b> is introduced. The model is derived mainly from an extended Entity-Relationship approach, but concepts from other semantic and object-oriented models have influenced its features. It is shown how high-level conceptual data models can be mapped to this model, {{and to what}} extent the object model subsumes classical modeling paradigms. 1 Introduction In recent years numerous data models for the conceptual modeling of information systems have been proposed. Among them there are semantic data models like SDM [13], IFO [3] and (extended) ER models [8, 9, 10, 24, 31, 34], complex object models like [1, 18, 26], purely object-based models like FDM [28] as well as object-based models with complex values such as [22]. All the approaches have different motivation, terminology, and aims. Here we aim to show you how some of these models can be translated into a conceptually simpl [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Entity {{suggestion}} {{by example}} (ESbE) {{refers to a}} type of entity acquisition query in which a user provides a set of example entities as the query and obtains in return some entities that best complete the concept underlying the given query. Such entity acquisition queries {{can be useful in}} many applications such as related-entity recommendation and query expansion. A number of ESbE query processing solutions exist in the literature. However, they mostly build only on the idea of entity co-occurrences either in text or web lists, without taking advantage of the existence of many web-scale conceptual taxonomies that consist of hierarchical <b>isA</b> <b>relationships</b> between entity-concept pairs. This paper provides a query processing method based on the relevance models between entity sets and concepts. These relevance models can be used to obtain the fine-grained concepts implied by the query entity set, and the entities that belong to a given concept, thereby providing the entity suggestions. Extensive evaluations with real data sets show that the accuracy of the queries processed with this new method is significantly higher than that of existing solutions...|$|R
40|$|Most common {{database}} management systems represent {{information in a}} simple record-based format. Semantic modeling provides richer data structuring capabilities for database applications. In particular, {{research in this area}} has articulated a number of constructs that provide mechanisms for representing structurally complex interrelations among data typically arising in commercial applications. In general terms, semantic modeling complements work on knowledge representation (in artificial intelligence) and on the new generation of database models based on the object-oriented paradigm of programming languages. This paper presents an in-depth discussion of semantic data modeling. It reviews the philosophical motivations of semantic models, including the need for high-level modeling abstractions and the reduction of semantic overloading of data type constructors. It then provides a tutorial introduction to the primary components of semantic models, which are the explicit representation of objects, attributes of and relationships among objects, type constructors for building complex types, <b>ISA</b> <b>relationships,</b> and derived schema components. Next, a survey of the prominent semantic models in the literature is presented. Further, since a broad area of research has developed around semantic modeling, a number of related topics based on these models are discussed, including data languages, graphical interfaces, theoretical investigations, and physical implementation strategies...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the complexity of}} reasoning over various fragments of the Extended Entity-Relationship (EER) language, which include different combinations of the constructors for isa between concepts and relationships, disjointness, covering, cardinality constraints and their refinement.

Surprisingly, when we also drop isa between relations, reasoning becomes NP-complete. If we further remove the possibility to express covering between entities, reasoning becomes polynomial. Our lower bound results are established by direct reductions, while the upper bounds follow from correspondences with expressive variants of the description logic DL-Lite.

This study used USGS stream gaging data to validate the temporal variation of simulated discharge in two watersheds.
