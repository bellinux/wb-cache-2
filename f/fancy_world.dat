60|$|The {{currents}} of practical business in America, the rude, coarse, tussling facts of our lives, {{and all their}} daily experiences, need just the precipitation and tincture of this entirely different <b>fancy</b> <b>world</b> of lulling, contrasting, even feudalistic, anti-republican poetry and romance. On the enormous outgrowth of our unloos'd individualities, and the rank, self-assertion of humanity here, may well fall these grace-persuading, recherche influences. We first require that individuals and communities shall be free; then surely {{comes a time when}} it is requisite that they shall not be too free. Although to such results in the future I look mainly for a great poetry native to us, these importations till then will have to be accepted, such as they are, and thankful they are no worse. The inmost spiritual {{currents of}} the present time curiously revenge and check their own compell'd tendency to democracy, and absorption in it, by mark'd leanings to the past--by reminiscences in poems, plots, operas, novels, to a far-off, contrary, deceased world, as if they dreaded the great vulgar gulf-tides of to-day. Then what has been fifty centuries growing, working in, and accepted as crowns and apices for our kind, {{is not going to be}} pulled down and discarded in a hurry.|$|E
60|$|His {{eyes were}} dark and very fine, and his {{delightful}} voice accompanied their visible language like music. He {{appeared to be}} exceedingly appreciative of whatever was passing among those who surrounded him, and especially of the vicissitudes in {{the consciousness of the}} person to whom he happened to be addressing himself at the moment. I felt that no effect upon my mind of what he uttered, no emotion, however transitory, in myself, escaped his notice, though not from any positive vigilance on his part, but because his faculty of observation was so penetrative and delicate; and to say the truth, it a little confused me to discern always a ripple on his mobile face, responsive to any slightest breeze that passed over the inner reservoir of my sentiments, and seemed thence to extend to a similar reservoir within himself. On matters of feeling, and within a certain depth, you might spare yourself the trouble of utterance, because he already knew what you wanted to say, and perhaps a little more than you would have spoken. His figure was full of gentle movement, though, somehow, without disturbing its quietude; and as he talked, he kept folding his hands nervously, and betokened in many ways a fine and immediate sensibility, quick to feel pleasure or pain, though scarcely capable, I should imagine, of a passionate experience in either direction. There was not am English trait in him from head to foot, morally, intellectually, or physically. Beef, ale, or stout, brandy or port-wine, entered not at all into his composition. In his earlier life, he appears to have given evidences of courage and sturdy principle, and of a tendency to fling himself into the rough struggle of humanity on the liberal side. It would be taking too much upon myself to affirm that this was merely a projection of his <b>fancy</b> <b>world</b> into the actual, and that he never could have hit a downright blow, and was altogether an unsuitable person to receive one. I beheld him not in his armor, but in his peacefulest robes. Nevertheless, drawing my conclusion merely from what I saw, it would have occurred to me that his main deficiency was a lack of grit. Though anything but a timid man, the combative and defensive elements were not prominently developed in his character, and could have been made available only when he put an unnatural force upon his instincts. It was on this account, and also because of the fineness of his nature generally, that the English appreciated him no better, and left this sweet and delicate poet poor, and with scanty laurels in his declining age.|$|E

60|$|He drifted on {{swiftly to}} Beldover, half-unconscious {{of his own}} movement. He saw the town on {{the slope of the}} hill, not straggling, but as if walled-in with the straight, final streets of miners' dwellings, making a great square, and it looked like Jerusalem to his <b>fancy.</b> The <b>world</b> was all strange and transcendent.|$|R

60|$|This answer puzzled old Holmes a good deal. He {{passed a}} hand over his face, and turned to his companion, one Tubbs, also a tenant on my estate, as if to ask assistance. Tubbs was one of the new school; a school that makes more laws than it respects, and belongs to the movement.

5000|$|American Fancy was a {{decorative}} style {{popular in the}} United States between 1790-1840. Author Sumpter Priddy writes, American Fancy is a [...] "cultural phenomenon born out of new and enlightened ways of seeing, understanding, and responding to the surrounding <b>world.</b> <b>Fancy</b> expressed itself in just about everything that pleased the senses; generally colorful and boldly patterned, it elicited delight, awe, surprise, whim, and caprice." ...|$|R

50|$|The brachycephalic {{mutation}} in the Persian breed occurred during World War II in the US. This {{led to a}} concerted effort to breed Persians with rounder heads and smaller ears than their ancient ancestors after World War II.

60|$|We {{are apt to}} <b>fancy</b> {{that the}} <b>world</b> will always go on very much as it goes on now; {{that it will be}} guided, not by the will of God, but by the will of man; by man's craft; by man's ambition; by man's self-interest; by man's cravings after the luxuries, and even after the mere necessities of this life. In a word, we are apt to fancy that man, not God, is the master of this earth on which we live, and that men have no king over them in heaven.|$|R

30|$|The {{imaginary}} accumulated {{by science}} fiction {{through the years}} has always <b>fancied</b> future <b>worlds</b> full of intelligent autonomous machines that were able to perceive the reality around. This ability of sensing {{the environment in which}} they were immersed allowed robots to act consequently. Decades ago, back in the true world, automation systems designers started to follow the path that the literature had drafted realizing that intelligence and perception go hand in hand. For instance, very simple devices can only carry out tasks that do not require perceiving and interacting with the real world (say moving a certain piece 5 [*]cm ahead in a conveyor belt). Such an easy process may be seen like driving blind a car: in case the piece falls off the belt, the device will just fail to carry out its task being also unable to find a proper reason for its failure. All living beings have incorporated diverse sensing parts and strategies in their ascent of the evolution chain, and so do machines: perception is the turning point that allows automation systems to collect the information needed to control their actions and the consequences of them.|$|R
60|$|The next morning, between monition and triumph, Martha {{announced}} that the good-for-nothing chap was off with a valuable parcel of Mr. Calcott's, and the police were after him; with much more about his former idle habits,--frequenting of democratic oratory, public-houses, and fondness for bad company and strolling actors. Meek and easily cowed, Charlotte only opened her lips to say {{she knew that he}} had taken home Mr. Calcott's parcel. But this brought down a storm on her for being impertinent enough to defend him, and she sat trembling till it had subsided; and Martha retreating, left her to weep unrestrainedly over her wild <b>fancies,</b> and the <b>world's</b> cruelty and injustice towards one whom, as she was now ready to declare, she loved with her whole heart.|$|R
60|$|I am {{inclined}} to think that both the writers of books, and the readers of them, are generally not a little unreasonable in their expectations. The first seem to <b>fancy</b> that the <b>world</b> must approve whatever they produce, and the latter to imagine that authors are obliged to please them at any rate. Methinks, as on the one hand, no single man is born with a right of controlling the opinions of all the rest; so on the other, the world has no title to demand, that the whole care and time of any particular person should be sacrificed to its entertainment. Therefore I cannot but believe that writers and readers are under equal obligations for as much fame, or pleasure, as each affords the other.|$|R

60|$|Bingley the manager, who assumed all {{the chief}} tragic and comic parts {{except when he}} {{modestly}} retreated {{to make way for}} the London stars, who came down occasionally to Chatteris, was great in the character of the 'Stranger.' He was attired in the tight pantaloons and Hessian boots which the stage legend has given to that injured man, with a large cloak and beaver and a hearse feather in it drooping over his raddled old face, and only partially concealing his great buckled brown wig. He had the stage jewellery on too, of which he selected the largest and most shiny rings for himself, and allowed his little finger to quiver out of his cloak with a sham diamond ring covering the first joint of the finger and twiddling in the faces of the pit. Bingley made it a favour to the young men of his company to go on in light comedy parts with that ring. They flattered him by asking its history. The stage has its traditional jewels as the Crown and all great families have. This had belonged to George Frederick Cooke, who had had it from Mr. Quin, who may have bought it for a shilling. Bingley <b>fancied</b> the <b>world</b> was fascinated with its glitter.|$|R
60|$|I {{looked across}} {{a vast and}} voiceless valley {{straight}} at the moon, as if at a round mirror. It {{may have been the}} blue moon of the proverb; for on that freezing night the very moon seemed blue with cold. A deathly frost fastened every branch and blade to its place. The sinking and softening forests, powdered with a gray frost, fell away underneath me into an abyss which seemed unfathomable. One <b>fancied</b> the <b>world</b> was soundless only because it was bottomless: it seemed as if all songs and cries had been swallowed in some unresisting stillness under the roots of the hills. I could fancy that if I shouted there would be no echo; that if I hurled huge stones there would be no noise of reply. A dumb devil had bewitched the landscape: but that again does not express the best or worst of it. All those hoary and frosted forests expressed something so inhuman that it has no human name. A horror of unconsciousness lay on them; that is the nearest phrase I know. It was as if one were looking {{at the back of the}} world; and the world did not know it. I had taken the universe in the rear. I was behind the scenes. I was eavesdropping upon an unconscious creation.|$|R
