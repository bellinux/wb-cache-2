5|$|Oats are {{the most}} popular grain for horses. Oats have a lower <b>digestible</b> energy value and higher fiber content than most other grains. They form a loose mass in the stomach that is well suited to the equine {{digestive}} system. They are also more palatable and <b>digestible</b> than other grains.|$|E
5|$|Low-calorie sugars and {{artificial}} sweeteners are often made of maltodextrin with added sweeteners. Maltodextrin is an easily <b>digestible</b> synthetic polysaccharide consisting of short chains of glucose molecules and {{is made by}} the partial hydrolysis of starch. The added sweeteners are often aspartame, saccharin, stevia, or sucralose.|$|E
5|$|The human {{innovation}} {{of cooking}} {{may have been}} particularly helpful in overcoming many of the defensive chemicals of plants. Many enzyme inhibitors in cereal grains and pulses, such as trypsin inhibitors prevalent in pulse crops, are denatured by cooking, making them <b>digestible.</b>|$|E
5|$|Corn (USA), or maize (British English), is {{the second}} most {{palatable}} grain. It provides twice as much <b>digestible</b> energy as an equal volume of oats and is low in fiber. Because of these characteristics, it is easy to over-feed corn, causing obesity, so horses are seldom fed corn all by itself. Nutritionists caution horse owners that moldy corn is poisonous if fed to horses.|$|E
5|$|Labradors have a {{well-known}} reputation for appetite, and some individuals may be highly indiscriminate, eating <b>digestible</b> and non-food objects alike. They are persistent and persuasive in requesting food. For this reason, the Labrador owner must carefully control their dog's food intake to avoid obesity {{and its associated}} health problems (see below).|$|E
5|$|The sand whiting is {{a highly}} prized table fish often rated equal to the King George whiting, making it a common target for both {{commercial}} and recreational fisheries. The flesh is white, tender and has a moist, low oil content composition, making it easily <b>digestible.</b> Investigations into the aquaculture of the species began in the 1980s, and {{has led to the}} development of farmed sand whiting.|$|E
5|$|Cyathus stercoreus {{has been}} {{investigated}} {{for its ability to}} break down lignin and cellulose in agricultural byproducts, like wheat straw or grasses. It selectively breaks down lignin, leaving much of the cellulose intact, which increases the amount of <b>digestible</b> carbohydrate for ruminant mammals, and enhances both its value as a food source and its biodegradability. The enzymes responsible, laccase and manganese peroxidase, also have industrial applications for lignin degradation and removal in the pulp and paper industry. Liquid cultures of C.stercoreus have also been shown to biodegrade the explosive compound 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT).|$|E
5|$|Another {{similarity}} {{with the}} stegosaurs is the narrow head, which might indicate a selective diet consisting of high-quality fodder. However, Barrett {{pointed out that}} for an animal the size of Scelidosaurus, with a large gut allowing efficient fermentation, the intake of easily <b>digestible</b> food of high energetic value was less important than with smaller animals, that are often critically dependent on it. Norman concluded that Scelidosaurus fed on low scrubby vegetation, with a height up to one metre. Raising itself on its hindlimbs alone, could have vertically increased the feeding envelope and was perhaps anatomically possible, but Norman doubted it was a relevant part of its behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Prized as an {{ingredient}} in various foods, B.edulis is an edible mushroom held in high regard in many cuisines, and is commonly prepared and eaten in soups, pasta, or risotto. The mushroom {{is low in}} fat and <b>digestible</b> carbohydrates, and high in protein, vitamins, minerals and dietary fibre. Although it is sold commercially, {{it is very difficult}} to cultivate. Available fresh in autumn in Central, Southern and Northern Europe, it is most often dried, packaged and distributed worldwide. It keeps its flavour after drying, and it is then reconstituted and used in cooking. B.edulis is one of the few fungi sold pickled. The fungus also produces a variety of organic compounds with a diverse spectrum of biological activity, including the steroid derivative ergosterol, a sugar binding protein, antiviral compounds, antioxidants, and phytochelatins, which give the organism resistance to toxic heavy metals.|$|E
5|$|The {{brown bear}} and both species of black bears {{sometimes}} take large ungulates, such as deer and bovids, mostly {{the young and}} weak. These animals may be taken by a short rush and ambush, though hiding young may be stiffed out and pounced on. The polar bear mainly preys on seals, stalking them from the ice or breaking into their dens. They primarily eat the highly <b>digestible</b> blubber. Large mammalian prey is typically killed by a bite to the head or neck, or (in the case of young) simply pinned down and mauled. Predatory behaviour in bears is typically taught to the young by the mother.|$|E
5|$|The {{aim of the}} ducker was to {{get every}} {{duckling}} as fat as possible {{by the age of}} eight weeks (the first moult, the age at which they would be killed for meat), while avoiding any foods which would build up their bones or make their flesh greasy. In their first week after hatching, the ducklings would be fed on boiled eggs, toast soaked in water, boiled rice and beef liver. From the second week on, this diet would gradually be replaced by barley meal and boiled rice mixed with greaves. (Some larger-scale duckers would boil a horse or sheep and feed this to the ducklings in place of greaves.) This high-protein diet was supplemented with nettles, cabbage and lettuce to provide a source of vitamins. As with all poultry, ducks require grit in their diet to break up the food and make it <b>digestible.</b> Aylesbury ducklings' drinking water was laced with grit from Long Marston and Gubblecote; this grit also gave their bills their distinctive pinkish colour. Around 85% of ducklings would survive this eight-week rearing process to be sent to market.|$|E
5|$|When {{foraging}} for plants, bears {{choose to}} eat them at the stage when they are at their most nutritious and <b>digestible,</b> typically avoiding older grasses, sedges and leaves. Hence, in more northern temperate areas, browsing and grazing is more common early in spring and later becomes more restricted. Knowing when plants are ripe for eating is a learned behaviour. Berries may be foraged in bushes or at the tops of trees, and bears try to maximize the number of berries consumed versus foliage. In autumn, some bear species forage large amounts of naturally fermented fruits, which affects their behaviour. Smaller bears climb trees to obtain mast (edible reproductive parts, such as acorns). Such masts can be {{very important to the}} diets of these species, and mast failures may result in long-range movements by bears looking for alternative food sources. Brown bears, with their powerful digging abilities, commonly eat roots. The panda's diet is over 99% bamboo, of 30 different species. Its strong jaws are adapted for crushing the tough stems of these plants, though they prefer to eat the more nutritious leaves. Bromeliads can make up to 50% of the diet of the spectacled bear, which also has strong jaws to bite them open.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} members of the genus, these leaf blades are densely covered by peduncular (stalked) {{mucilaginous}} glands and sessile (flat) digestive glands. The peduncular glands consist of a few secretory cells on top of a single-celled stalk. These cells produce a mucilaginous secretion which forms visible droplets across the leaf surface. This wet appearance probably helps lure prey in search of water; a similar phenomenon is observed in the sundews. The droplets secrete only limited enzymes and serve mainly to entrap insects. On contact with an insect, the peduncular glands release additional mucilage from special reservoir cells located at the base of their stalks. The insect struggles, triggering more glands and encasing itself in mucilage. P. moranensis can bend its leaf edges slightly by thigmotropism, bringing additional glands into contact with the trapped insect. The sessile glands, which lie flat on the leaf surface, serve to digest the insect prey. Once the prey is entrapped by the peduncular glands and digestion begins, the initial flow of nitrogen triggers enzyme release by the sessile glands. These enzymes, which include amylase, esterase, phosphatase, protease, and ribonuclease break down the <b>digestible</b> components of the insect body. These fluids are then absorbed back into the leaf surface through cuticular holes, leaving only the chitin exoskeleton of the larger insects on the leaf surface.|$|E
25|$|Less desirably, {{hazardous}} molds {{have been}} found aboard space stations, molds that degrade rubber into a <b>digestible</b> form.|$|E
25|$|Cattle are ruminants, meaning their {{digestive}} system is highly specialized {{to allow the}} use of poorly <b>digestible</b> plants as food. Cattle have one stomach with four compartments, the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum, with the rumen being the largest compartment.|$|E
25|$|In {{ruminant}} nutrition, {{depending on}} the extent of lignification of the cell wall, pectin is up to 90% <b>digestible</b> by bacterial enzymes. Ruminant nutritionists recommend that the digestibility and energy concentration in forages can be improved by increasing pectin concentration in the forage.|$|E
25|$|In some cultures, congee is eaten {{primarily}} as a breakfast food or late supper; in others, it is eaten {{as a substitute for}} rice at other meals. It is often considered particularly suitable for the sick as a mild, easily <b>digestible</b> food.|$|E
25|$|Bertley's {{background}} in applied science and science education have {{led him to}} generate ways of distilling complex scientific principles into more easily <b>digestible</b> concepts for a wide and inclusive audience. He appears frequently on local and national networks including NBC, ABC, CBS, PBS, and FOX.|$|E
25|$|Rice protein, when {{made from}} the whole grain, is a protein source that is highly <b>digestible</b> and {{allergen}} free. Since rice protein is low in the amino acid lysine, it is often combined with pea protein powder to achieve a superior amino acid profile.|$|E
25|$|Carnivore and {{herbivore}} diets are contrasting, {{with basic}} nitrogen and carbon proportions vary for their particular foods. Many herbivores rely on bacterial fermentation to create <b>digestible</b> nutrients from indigestible plant cellulose, while obligate carnivores must eat animal meats to obtain certain vitamins or nutrients their bodies cannot otherwise synthesize.|$|E
25|$|Various myths {{hold that}} {{swallowed}} gum {{will remain in}} a human's stomach for up to 7 years, as it is not <b>digestible.</b> According to several medical opinions, {{there seems to be}} little truth behind the tale. In most cases, swallowed gum will pass through the system as quickly as any other food.|$|E
25|$|In its {{soundbite}} diffusion {{through the}} channels of marketeers and popular media, who eagerly and constantly reminded their audience that the metrosexual was straight, the metrosexual has congealed {{into something more}} <b>digestible</b> for consumers: a heterosexual male who is {{in touch with his}} feminine side—he color-coordinates, cares deeply about exfoliation, and has perhaps manscaped.|$|E
25|$|The {{length of}} time {{required}} for anaerobic digestion depends on the chemical complexity of the material. Material rich in easily <b>digestible</b> sugars breaks down quickly where as intact lignocellulosic material rich in cellulose and hemicellulose polymers can take much longer to break down. Anaerobic microorganisms are generally unable to break down lignin, the recalcitrant aromatic component of biomass.|$|E
25|$|Tsampa {{is used in}} {{a number}} of other ways. Mashes of tsampa and cumin are {{sometimes}} applied to toothaches or other sore spots. Tsampa is also known among Tibetan sportsmen for its ability to provide rapid energy boosts; the roasting of the flour breaks it down to an easily <b>digestible</b> state, allowing the calories therein to be quickly incorporated by the body.|$|E
25|$|In beans, {{endogenous}} gases seem {{to arise}} from complex oligosaccharides (carbohydrates) that are particularly resistant to digestion by mammals, but are readily <b>digestible</b> by gut flora – microorganisms (methane-producing archaea; Methanobrevibacter smithii) that inhabit the digestive tract. These oligosaccharides {{pass through the}} upper intestine largely unchanged, and when they reach the lower intestine, bacteria feed on them, producing copious amounts of flatus.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} initial issue {{when considering the}} application of anaerobic digestion systems is the feedstock to the process. Almost any organic material can be processed with anaerobic digestion; however, if biogas production is the aim, the level of putrescibility is the key factor in its successful application. The more putrescible (<b>digestible)</b> the material, the higher the gas yields possible from the system.|$|E
25|$|The {{body parts}} of the large lepidosaurian in the stomach had been made more <b>digestible</b> by biting them into pieces. According to Dal Sasso & Maganuco the {{hatchling}} would certainly have been incapable of achieving this and they considered it a strong indication of parental care as it was improbable the animal had by chance encountered a carcass neatly ripped apart into easily swallowed bits by predators or scavengers.|$|E
25|$|The corms, {{which have}} a light purple color due to {{phenolic}} pigments, are roasted, baked or boiled, and the natural sugars give a sweet nutty flavor. The starch is easily <b>digestible,</b> and since the grains are fine and small it is often used for baby food. Young taro leaves and stems can be eaten after boiling twice to remove the acrid flavor and the leaves are {{a good source of}} vitamins A and C and contain more protein than the corms.|$|E
25|$|Feces are a {{rich source}} of vitamin B12 and many species, including, dogs, and cats eat feces.|url=http://www.dsm.com/markets/anh/en_US/Compendium/companion_animals/vitamin_B12.html|publisher=DSM|accessdate=January 17, 2017}} Species within the Lagomorpha (rabbits, hares, and pikas) produce two types of fecal pellets: hard ones, and soft ones called cecotropes. Animals in these species re-ingest their own cecotropes, which consist of chewed plant {{material}} that was metabolized by bacteria in the cecum, a chamber between the small and large intestines. Cecotropes contain <b>digestible</b> carbohydrates and B vitamins synthesized by the resident bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Despite its staid reputation, The Lawrence Welk Show {{nonetheless}} kept up {{with the}} times and never limited itself strictly to music of the big-band era. During the 1960s and 1970s, for instance, the show incorporated material by such contemporary sources as the Beatles, Burt Bacharach and Hal David, the Everly Brothers and Paul Williams, all arranged in a format that was easily <b>digestible</b> to older viewers. Originally produced in black and white, in 1957 the show began being recorded on videotape, and it switched to color for the fall 1965 season.|$|E
25|$|The {{partially}} digested and pulverized gizzard contents {{are passed}} into the intestine, where pancreatic and intestinal enzymes complete the digestion of the <b>digestible</b> food. The digestion products are then absorbed through the intestinal mucosa into the blood. The intestine ends via the large intestine in the vent or cloaca which serves as the common exit for renal and intestinal excrements {{as well as for}} the laying of eggs. However, unlike mammals, many birds do not excrete the bulky portions (roughage) of their undigested food (e.g. feathers, fur, bone fragments, and seed husks) via the cloaca, but regurgitate them as food pellets.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} soluble carbohydrates {{of mature}} soybeans are the disaccharide sucrose (range 2.5–8.2%), the trisaccharide raffinose (0.1–1.0%) composed of one sucrose molecule connected to one molecule of galactose, and the tetrasaccharide stachyose (1.4 to 4.1%) composed of one sucrose connected to two molecules of galactose. While the oligosaccharides raffinose and stachyose protect {{the viability of}} the soybean seed from desiccation (see above section on physical characteristics) they are not <b>digestible</b> sugars, so contribute to flatulence and abdominal discomfort in humans and other monogastric animals, comparable to the disaccharide trehalose. Undigested oligosaccharides are broken down in the intestine by native microbes, producing gases such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and methane.|$|E
25|$|Long-term use of NSAIDs {{can lead}} to mucosal damage of the colon, {{secondary}} to decreased levels of homeostatic prostaglandins. Mucosal injury is usually limited to the right dorsal colon, but can be more generalized. Horses may display acute or chronic intermittent colic, peripheral edema secondary to protein losing enteropathy, decreased appetite, and diarrhea. Treatment involves decreasing the fiber levels of the horse's diet by reducing grass and hay, and placing the horse on an easily <b>digestible</b> pelleted feed until the colon can heal. Additionally, the horse may be given misoprostol, sucralfate, and psyllium to try to improve mucosal healing, as well as metronidazole to reduce inflammation of the colon.|$|E
25|$|The soy {{carbohydrates}} in tempeh {{become more}} <b>digestible</b> {{as a result}} of the fermentation process. In particular, the oligosaccharides associated with gas and indigestion are greatly reduced by the Rhizopus culture. In traditional tempeh-making shops, the starter culture often contains beneficial bacteria that produce vitamins such as B12 (though it is uncertain whether this B12 is always present and bioavailable). In western countries, it is more common to use a pure culture containing only Rhizopus oligosporus, which makes very little B12 and could be missing Citrobacter freundii and Klebsiella pneumoniae, which have been shown to produce significant levels of B12 analogs in tempeh when present. Whether these analogs are true, bioavailable B12, has not been thoroughly studied yet.|$|E
25|$|Its {{primary use}} is as feed for high-producing dairy cows, {{because of its}} high protein content and highly <b>digestible</b> fiber, and {{secondarily}} for beef cattle, horses, sheep, and goats. Alfalfa hay is a widely used protein and fiber source for meat rabbits. In poultry diets, dehydrated alfalfa and alfalfa leaf concentrates are used for pigmenting eggs and meat, because of their high content in carotenoids, which are efficient for colouring egg yolk and body lipids. Humans also eat alfalfa sprouts in salads and sandwiches. Dehydrated alfalfa leaf is commercially available as a dietary supplement in several forms, such as tablets, powders and tea. Fresh alfalfa can cause bloating in livestock, so {{care must be taken}} with livestock grazing on alfalfa because of this hazard.|$|E
25|$|Organisms {{typically}} cannot metabolize {{all types}} of carbohydrate to yield energy. Glucose is a nearly universal and accessible source of energy. Many organisms also {{have the ability to}} metabolize other monosaccharides and disaccharides but glucose is often metabolized first. In Escherichia coli, for example, the lac operon will express enzymes for the digestion of lactose when it is present, but if both lactose and glucose are present the lac operon is repressed, resulting in the glucose being used first (see: Diauxie). Polysaccharides are also common sources of energy. Many organisms can easily break down starches into glucose; most organisms, however, cannot metabolize cellulose or other polysaccharides like chitin and arabinoxylans. These carbohydrate types can be metabolized by some bacteria and protists. Ruminants and termites, for example, use microorganisms to process cellulose. Even though these complex carbohydrates are not very <b>digestible,</b> they represent an important dietary element for humans, called dietary fiber. Fiber enhances digestion, among other benefits.|$|E
