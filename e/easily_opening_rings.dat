40|$|Author's {{final draft}} after peer reviewSelective <b>ring</b> <b>opening</b> of cellulose-derived furanic {{molecules}} is a promising pathway {{for the production}} of industrially relevant linear oxygenates, such as 1, 6 -hexanediol. 2, 5 -dimethylfuran (DMF) is employed as a model compound in combined experimental and computational investigations to provide insights into metal-catalyzed <b>ring</b> <b>opening.</b> Ring opening to 2 -hexanol and 2 -hexanone and ring saturation to 2, 5 -dimethyltetrahydrofuran (DMTHF) are identified as two main parallel pathways. Density functional theory calculations and microkinetic modeling indicate DMF adsorbs on Ru in an open-ring configuration, which is potentially a common surface intermediate leading to both <b>ring</b> <b>opening</b> and <b>ring</b> saturation products. While the activation barriers for the two pathways are comparable, formation of DMTHF is more thermodynamically favorable. In addition, steric interactions with co-adsorbed 2 -propoxyl, derived from the solvent, and the oxophilic nature of Ru play key roles in determining the product distribution: the former favors less bulky, i. e., ring-closed, intermediates, and the latter retards O-H bond formation. Finally, we show that hydrodeoxygenation of oxygenated furanics, such as 5 -methylfurfural and (5 -methyl- 2 -furyl) methanol, on Ru preferentially occurs at oxygen-containing side groups to form DMF, followed by either <b>ring</b> <b>opening</b> or <b>ring</b> saturation.

40|$|A {{textbook}} {{example of}} a pericyclic reaction is the electrocyclic <b>ring</b> <b>opening</b> of cyclobutene. The stereochemical outcome of this reaction can typically be predicted using the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, {{which are based on}} conservation of orbital symmetry. According to these rules, the thermal <b>ring</b> <b>opening</b> reaction will proceed in conrotatory fashion, while the photochemical <b>ring</b> <b>opening</b> reaction will proceed in disrotatory fashion. Over the years, there have been very few exceptions to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules. However, two apparent exceptions to these rules occur when the <b>ring</b> <b>opening</b> of cyclobutene is initiated by exciting the molecule with light or by applying a mechanical force. In this work, we use first principles quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics to examine the photochemical and mechanochemical <b>ring</b> <b>opening</b> of cyclobutene.

40|$|Dihydrouridine {{is absent}} from the tRNA of almost all hyperthermophiles and most Archaea but is {{ubiquitous}} in the tRNA of Eubacteria and Eukaryotes. In order to investigate whether this {{could be due to}} instability, the rate of <b>ring</b> <b>opening</b> of dihydrouridine was measured between 25 and 120 C. The dihydrouridine ring is stable at 25 C, but the half-life at 100 C and pH 7 is 9. 1 h, which is comparable to the doubling time of hyperthermophiles. This suggests an explanation for the absence of dihydrouridine from the tRNA of hyperthermophiles. The rates of <b>ring</b> <b>opening</b> of dihydrouracil, dihydrothymine, and 1 -N-methyldihydrouracil were measured at 100 C and pH 6 - 9, as were the equilibrium constants for ring closure of the ureido acids to the dihydrouracils.
