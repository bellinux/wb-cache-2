40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} ways that black GIs defined their manhood through {{the rhetoric of the}} Black Power Movement, their participation in protest groups, and their experiences in combat with white and Latino men. The promise of equal treatment in the armed forces seemed genuine to black soldiers in the mid-sixties. Like their civilian peers in the Civil Rights Movement, black servicemen grew impatient with the pace of change and felt “feminized” by their subordinate status in the armed forces. African-American GIs, in other words, were frustrated by their lack of power. These young men found themselves fighting in large numbers {{on the front lines of}} an unpopular war. Many white superiors refused to grant well deserved promotions to black soldiers, but were quick to punish them for minor <b>infractions</b> <b>of</b> military <b>regulations.</b> In addition to their problems with the military hierarchy, black soldiers often felt alienated from their white peers. Black Power addressed these feelings of powerlessness and alienation. Searching for social and personal power, young African-American GIs engendered themselves as black men through their communitarian ties and their defiance of military authority. Yet the need for teamwork in combat and the seductive appeal of military notions of manliness meant that most black men found common ground with their white compatriots and never abandoned interracial male friendships altogether. This study elucidates the strategies that African-American men have devised to deal with their marginal status in American society. ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, {{bound by}} the new PROTECT Act of 2003, the DOJ made {{sweeping}} changes to the 2257 regulations {{to keep up with}} the proliferation of sexually explicit material found on the Internet. However, the [...] "secondary producer" [...] language not only remained in the regulations, but the DOJ created a much wider interpretation of who exactly was a [...] "producer" [...] of sexually explicit material and hence was required to comply with the new regulations. Anyone who touched explicit content in any way could arguably be considered a producer and be forced to maintain identification records of models along with a highly complex indexing system that many argue is impossible to implement. Under the current law, anyone who commercially operates a website or releases sexually explicit images of actual humans, regardless of the format (DVD, photos, books, etc.), is subject to penalties that include up to five years in federal prison per each <b>infraction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>regulations.</b> These regulations do not currently apply to explicit drawings (i.e., adult cartoons, hentai) as no actual humans are involved in such production. However, the exclusion for such sexually explicit drawings are being confronted with changes to these laws in the recently signed Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act addendum to the adult record-keeping requirements now codified at 18 U.S.C. § 2257A. [...] At this time, though signed into law, the portions of § 2257A which include simulated sex are not enforceable.|$|R
