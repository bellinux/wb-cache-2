500|$|Turtles {{attack on}} Eagle {{reflected}} both the desperation of American forces {{after the fall}} of New York and the tendency of the weaker belligerent to adopt and embrace new, sometimes radical, technologies. “What astonishment it will produce and what advantages may be made…if it succeeds, [...] more <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to conceive than for me to describe,” physician Benjamin Gale wrote to Silas Deane less than a year before Turtle’s mission.|$|E
500|$|... "Lucky Day" [...] is a pop song {{featuring}} {{an upbeat}} rhythm and synths. The song has gathered comparisons to the Katy Perry song [...] "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)" [...] (2010) and music by David Guetta for its dance themes. In the introduction Roberts sings [...] "Could it be my lucky day?"; the track continues with [...] "Just light the first spark, {{and watch the}} fireworks explode. Boom, Boom, Baby", {{in what has been}} described by Robert Copsey of Digital Spy as a [...] "60s-swing-meets-East-London vibe". Roberts' voice has been described by Katherine St Asaph of Pop Dust as a [...] "springy" [...] vibrato, with breathy background vocals featuring sounds effect including repeated kissing noises. Roberts sings about falling in love with someone, as she sings: [...] "Aah, say that you love me, say that you need me too... best you ever had. It could be so <b>easy,</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to please me, baby. So how come you tease me?". Roberts discussed the track on her blog, commenting that its lyrical content alludes to a boy that initially does not share the same feelings as his partner, [...] "but in the end you win him over and it's your lucky day. You can take it however you want though, maybe you won on the scratch cards and so you had a lucky day, that kind of thing". Roberts described it as a [...] "romantic reference" [...] with a [...] "down-beat track underneath", and in contrast called the top-line of the track [...] "quite cute and girly". A remix of the song was producer by band White Lies, and debuted on The Guardian. The 90s-themed concept incorporates house music, with [...] "chunky" [...] beats and [...] "twinkly" [...] synths to the original instrumental of the song.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the female}} protagonists {{challenge}} their male [...] "suitors" [...] {{to keep up}} instead of being full of empty promises; the women further feel that [...] "He's not fulfilling you like he says". Williams further explained {{the meaning of the}} song during an interview with MTV News, [...] "We've had experiences with men doing a lot of talking but they can’t back it up. You said you could do this, but you can't, whether that's on the dance floor or wherever else. He said what he could do for you, but..." [...] The lyrics are constructed in the chorus-verse pattern. The song opens with the lines [...] "Hit me" [...] and the first verses sung by Beyoncé follow: [...] "I put it right there made it <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to get to / Now you want to act like you don't know what to do". The chorus follows during which the group repeatedly sings the lines [...] "Can you keep up?". Rowland's second verses follow where she sings the lines [...] "Put it on me deep in the right direction". The chorus is repeated twice before the bridge by Williams. After the bridge, the group sings the lines [...] "Here's your papers, baby you are dismissed" [...] letting their man know that he is not good enough for them. Rowland sings a short ad lib, and then the trio ends with a repeated chorus. Nick Reynolds from BBC compared the song Missy Elliott's [...] "Pass That Dutch" [...] and to songs by The Supremes. He further found a name check of Public Enemy's [...] "Bring the Noise". Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine also compared [...] "Lose My Breath with [...] "Pass That Dutch".|$|E

500|$|Mattea's self-titled debut {{came out}} in 1984, with Hill and Rick Peoples as the album's producers. Mattea later noted that [...] "there were no budgets" [...] when she was {{recording}} the album, as {{she was unable to}} afford a $75 makeup session, and the front cover featured her wearing a jacket which she had purchased at Kmart. Even so, four of its singles made the Hot Country Songs charts, starting with [...] "Street Talk", which charted at No.25. Mattea had originally recorded a demo of the song with the intent of having Terri Gibbs record it, but Mattea kept it for herself when Gibbs declined the song. Followup [...] "Someone Is Falling in Love" [...] (written by Pebe Sebert) made it to No.26 on the same chart, while [...] "You've Got a Soft Place to Fall" [...] and [...] "That's <b>Easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>You</b> to Say" [...] fell short of the top 40. Other notable cuts on the album included [...] "God Ain't No Stained Glass Window", which was released as a 12" [...] promotional single for the Christmas season; a cover version of Barry Manilow's 1981 hit [...] "Somewhere Down the Road"; and [...] "(Back to the) Heartbreak Kid", which later became a Top 10 hit on the country charts for Restless Heart in late 1985 to early 1986. Allmusic reviewer William Ruhlmann wrote of the album that it was [...] "a fairly representative sampling of Nashville formula country writing", while praising the [...] "feisty" [...] nature of [...] "Street Talk" [...] and Mattea's vocals on [...] "Heartbreak Kid". People reviewer Ralph Novak compared Mattea's voice favorably to Anne Murray and said that [...] "Mattea may not have the most revolutionary sound around, but her material is especially good." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{because of}} Eiseley's intense and poetic writing style and {{his focus on}} nature and cosmology, he was not {{accepted}} or understood by most of his colleagues. [...] "You," [...] a friend told him, [...] "are a freak, you know. A God-damned freak, and life {{is never going to}} be <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> You like scholarship, but the scholars, some of them, anyhow, are not going to like you because you don’t stay in the hole where God supposedly put you. You keep sticking your head out and looking around. In a university that’s inadvisable." ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 10, 2006, in {{a meeting}} of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of which Coleman was a member, during {{testimony}} of former Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) director Michael D. Brown, Coleman attacked Brown for poor leadership during Hurricane Katrina disaster relief efforts, [...] "you didn't provide the leadership, even with structural infirmities." [...] Coleman went on, [...] "you're not prepared to kind of put a mirror in front of your face and recognize your own inadequacies" [...] and [...] "the record reflects that you didn't get it or you didn't in writing or in some way make commands that would move people to do {{what has to be done}} until way after it should have been done." [...] Brown responded combatively, [...] "well, Senator, that's very <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to say sitting behind that dais and not being there in the middle of that disaster, watching that human suffering and watching those people dying and trying to deal with those structural dysfunctionalities" [...] and implored Coleman to stick to questions. He later likened Coleman's charges to a [...] "drive-by shooting." [...] Brown had recently stated that he notified Department of Homeland Security and the White House of the tremendous scale of Katrina flooding earlier than had been previously reported.|$|E
