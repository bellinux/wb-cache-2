5|$|King John <b>I</b> <b>accepted</b> Ottoman {{suzerainty}} in 1529, {{but in the}} Treaty of Nagyvárad of 1538 {{he conceded}} {{the right of the}} Habsburgs to succeed him after his death. At that point his voivodes, Stephen Majláth and Emeric Balassa, decided to separate Transylvania from the kingdom in order to save the province from an Ottoman invasion. Although other leading Transylvanian noblemen soon joined them, King John I overcame their rebellion in some weeks.|$|E
5|$|Belgium gained its {{independence}} from the United Netherlands in 1830 and was established as a popular and constitutional monarchy under a bicameral parliamentary democracy. A liberal Constitution was written in 1831 which codified the responsibilities and restrictions imposed on the monarch. Although the King, as head of state, was prevented from acting without the approval of a government minister, he was allowed full control of military matters {{in his capacity as}} Commander-in-Chief. Which responsibility would take precedence if they became incompatible was left ambiguous and this uncertainty would {{lie at the heart of}} the Royal Question. The first king, Leopold <b>I,</b> <b>accepted</b> the terms of the Constitution but attempted to use its ambiguities to subtly increase his own powers. This was continued by his successors, although with little real success.|$|E
5|$|The Huguenot-Walloon New Netherland Commission was {{established}} in 1922 {{under the auspices of}} the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America in anticipation of the upcoming anniversary. President Warren G. Harding was the honorary president of the commission, and Belgium's King Albert <b>I</b> <b>accepted</b> an honorary chairmanship. The commission, led by its chairman, Rev. Dr. John Baer Stoudt, planned an observance for the 300th anniversary of the Nieuw Nederlandt voyage, and sought the issuance of commemorative stamps and coins. At the time, commemorative coins were not sold by the government—Congress, in authorizing legislation, designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase the coins at face value and vend them to the public at a premium.|$|E

5|$|Anne was the {{daughter}} of Thomas Boleyn, later Earl of Wiltshire and Earl of Ormond, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Howard, daughter of Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk. Thomas Boleyn was a well respected diplomat with a gift for languages; he was also a favourite of King Henry VII, who sent him on many diplomatic missions abroad. Anne and her siblings grew up at Hever Castle in Kent. However, the siblings were born in Norfolk at the Boleyn home at Blickling. A lack of parish records from the period has made it impossible to establish Anne's date of birth. Contemporary evidence is contradictory, with several dates having been put forward by various historians. An Italian, writing in 1600, suggested that she had been born in 1499, while Sir Thomas More's son-in-law, William Roper, indicated a much later date of 1512. Her birth was most likely sometime between 1501 and 1507. As with Anne herself, it is uncertain when her two siblings were born, but it seems clear that her sister Mary was older than Anne. Mary's children clearly believed their mother had been the elder sister. Most historians now agree that Mary was born in 1499. Mary's grandson claimed the Ormonde title in 1596 on the basis she was the elder daughter, which Elizabeth <b>I</b> <b>accepted.</b> Their brother George was born around 1504.|$|E
5|$|The Bajovići, {{having the}} slava (patron saint day) of St. Nicholas, {{with tens of}} houses in Bezuje, and one house in their {{original}} village of Rudinice (1971), have several versions of their origin: the first that they descend from a brother of Bajo Pivljanin; the second, from a villager called Čepur that took over Bajo Pivljanin's estate after the family left; the third, that the Bajovići who were really called Čepuri until 1887 descend from a branch of a family tree also including the Vračari and Taušani, {{closely related to the}} Gagovići, in line with their slava in common. Based on the presumed connection with Pivljanin, King Nikola <b>I</b> <b>accepted</b> member Đorđija Bajović into officer school. When S. Tomić did field research in Piva in 1912–13 and 1924, however, he recorded the Bajovići, called Čepuri in Gornje Rudinice with two houses, as hailing from Bajovo Polje and being direct descendants of Bajo Nikolić Pivljanin. Meanwhile, Tomić had recorded four or six houses of Bajovići in Bezuje that belonged to the Vračari brotherhood, itself descending from the Gagovići brotherhood.|$|E
5|$|Putnam has {{consistently}} {{adhered to the}} idea of semantic holism, in spite of the many changes in his other positions. The problems with this position have been described by Michael Dummett, Jerry Fodor, Ernest Lepore, and others. In the first place, they suggest that, if semantic holism is true, it is impossible to understand how a speaker of a language can learn the meaning of an expression, for any expression of the language. Given the limits of our cognitive abilities, we {{will never be able to}} master the whole of the English (or any other) language, even based on the (false) assumption that languages are static and immutable entities. Thus, if one must understand all of a natural language to understand a single word or expression, language learning is simply impossible. Semantic holism also fails to explain how two speakers can mean the same thing when using the same linguistic expression, and therefore how any communication at all is possible between them. Given a sentence P, since Fred and Mary have each mastered different parts of the English language and P is related in different ways to the sentences in each part, the result is that P means one thing for Fred and something else for Mary. Moreover, if a sentence P derives its meaning from its relations with all of the sentences of a language, as soon as the vocabulary of an individual changes by the addition or elimination of a sentence, the totality of relations changes, and therefore also the meaning of P. As this is a common phenomenon, the result is that P has two different meanings in two different moments in the life of the same person. Consequently, if I accept the truth of a sentence and then reject it later on, the meaning of that which I rejected and that which <b>I</b> <b>accepted</b> are completely different and therefore I cannot change my opinions with regard to the same sentences.|$|E

In 1000, Boleslaw the Brave, continuing the policy of his father Mieszko, held a Congress of Gniezno and created the metropolis of Gniezno and the dioceses of Kraków, Kołobrzeg, and Wrocław. However, the pagan unrest led to the transfer of the capital to Kraków in 1038 by Casimir I the Restorer.|$|E
25|$|In August 1342, Alfonso XI laid siege to the {{strategic}} port of Algeciras {{on the western}} side of the Bay of Gibraltar with a Castilian naval force blockading the city's access to the sea. The twenty-month siege was notable for its use of cannon by the Moors; {{it was one of the}} first occasions that guns were used effectively in European warfare. Although they succeeded in holding off the Castilians, neither side was able to gain the upper hand until the Castilian fleet managed to lay a boom across the entrance to the harbour of Algeciras, completing the blockade. With the garrison now completely cut off, Yusuf <b>I</b> <b>accepted</b> defeat in March 1344 and proposed a fifteen-year truce in exchange for the surrender of Algeciras, permitting the garrison to withdraw peacefully, and the resumption of tribute payments by Granada to Castile. Alfonso XI accepted the proposal but reduced the truce period to ten years.|$|E

[...] He proved to be skilled at arranging mergers of companies and within six years of joining the firm was made a partner, at the age of 29 years. [...] At Slaughter and May, Clark worked exclusively for the firm's merchant bank clients and was involved in the bitter takeover of Millspaugh by Hadfield. [...] In 1957 Clark became a director of Marchwiel Holdings, better known as Alfred McAlpine the civil engineering firm, and would remain on their board until 1996.|$|E
500|$|Hanna {{stated that}} he would accept no office in the McKinley administration, as he feared it {{would be seen as}} a reward for his {{political}} efforts. [...] He had long wished to be a senator, speaking of this desire as early as 1892. [...] Senator Sherman, now aged almost 74, faced a difficult re-election battle with the Democrats and the Foraker faction in 1898. [...] On January 4, 1897, McKinley offered Sherman the office of Secretary of State; he immediately accepted. [...] The poor record Sherman posted prior to his departure from office in 1898 led to attacks on Hanna, suggesting that a senile man had been placed in a key Cabinet position to accommodate him. Foraker, in his memoirs, strongly implied that Sherman was moved out of the way to allow Hanna to have his Senate seat. [...] An embittered Sherman stated in a letter after his departure as secretary, [...] "When [...] urged me to accept the position of Secretary of State, <b>I</b> <b>accepted</b> with some reluctance and largely to promote the wishes of Mark Hanna. [...] The result was that I lost the position both of Senator and Secretary... They deprived me of the high office of Senator by the temporary appointment as Secretary of State." ...|$|E

At their first meeting, Tony Holland informed Richard that they were planning a programme that would not [...] "duck social issues but would be a hard-hitting drama including teenage pregnancy, drugs, racial conflict, prostitution, rape, mental illness, homosexuality, alcoholism, and muggings among its subjects." [...] In order to carry such controversial storylines, Richard was told that [...] "powerful characters to whom things just naturally happened" [...] had been invented, and two families, the Fowlers and the Beales, were to form the core of the soap's narrative. In her autobiography, Richard states, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>accepted,</b> my character was to be Pauline Fowler. A middle-aged mother of two teenagers, with a late baby on the way, Pauline worked part-time at the launderette, voted Labour and supported Arsenal. She was married to Arthur, who was out of work and was really a bit of a failure, not much good at anything in life." [...] Richard thought it sounded like a challenging role.|$|E
