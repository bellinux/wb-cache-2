40|$|Behaviour {{falls into}} two categories: 1) appetitive and 2) consummatory {{behaviour}}. Appetitive behaviour is behaviour that leads up to need fulfillment. So {{if an individual}} is hungry it will start to move around and forage {{in order to obtain}} food. The actual food ingestion will satisfy the need to forage for food and is called a consummatory behaviour. In <b>ethological</b> <b>needs</b> the emphasis is on appetitive behaviour. In my thesis <b>ethological</b> <b>needs</b> are defined as: " The need to perform a behaviour that is rewarding in itself. The need for performance of this behaviour, even if appropriate substrate is absent, is so strong that thwarting it too long leads to stress and stereotypies. If a possibility is offered to perform the behaviour after extensive periods of deprivation a rebound effect occurs. " The fact that <b>ethological</b> <b>needs</b> for animals are partly included in the law system by promoting normal natural behaviour, stresses their importance. But it also raises the question if perhaps we humans also have <b>ethological</b> <b>needs.</b> In order to answer this research question, I looked into animal <b>ethological</b> <b>needs</b> as well. Ofcourse it is impossible to include all needs of all animal species therefore in this thesis I have focused mainly on well researched farm and/or pet species, such as horses and pigs and for a small part on a few non-human primate species. In animals I have found needs that can be categorized as: nesting needs, social behaviour and foraging and exploration needs. There are many more behaviours that individuals feel they should express but I have chosen these needs as a basis. Some have parallels with behaviours that humans express. For instance humans have a strong desire to be social, to feel autonomous and competent. Evidence for a need to explore and being occupied is a little thin spread for humans, but does exist. The <b>ethological</b> <b>needs</b> that I have found can be traced back (in part) to behavioural patterns seen in primitive man. In modern man the behaviours seem to be harder to pinpoint due to uncontrollability of the environment but also due to cultural differences across populations...|$|E

With a look at a wildcat species of similar size that shares common ancestry with our domestic pet, we can perhaps better understand the origin and bases of many of these needs.

5000|$|Dependency need is an {{important}} psychological concept, encompassing the fields of psychological, evolutionary, and <b>ethological</b> theory. <b>Need,</b> in general, is a concept greatly studied in varying psychological fields, by psychologists with varying specialties. Need is particularly important {{to the area of}} personality psychology. The concept of need can be defined as a [...] "state of tension within a person", and as the need is satisfied, the state of tension is reduced. (Larsen & Buss, 2008) It is thought that all individuals have needs, and that needs organize perceptions, guiding individuals to see what they want (or need) to see (Larsen & Buss). A physical or psychological need is capable of organizing action by compelling an individual to do what is necessary in order to fulfill such a need. (Larsen & Buss, 2008) After action has been taken to fulfill the need, the need subsides until it is again desired and recurs.|$|R

The other aims are as follows: basic information about parameters of goat production, processing and market of bio-products, economy of goat breeding and subsidies in goat breeding. The goat breeding was monitoring at the Slunečná organic farm in the Šumava Mountains. The results were interpreted {{on the basis of the}} study of special literature and legislation about organic farming and ethology of goats.

The physiological and <b>ethological</b> <b>needs</b> of animals are satisfactory. It is due to modern technologies for stabling, milking, slaughtering and another handling with animals.

40|$|In feral and free-ranging environments, equids {{typically}} form stable {{social groups}} with cohesive long living social bonds {{between members of}} the group. Disruption of these bonds is uncommon except during juvenile dispersal or conflict between stallions, both processes being associated with social stress and disruption of group structure. Foals are precocial developers and first associate only with their dams. Later, they also associate with peers and develop pair bonds between preferred individuals. Mutual grooming is common; it maintains pair bonding and can {{be a source of}} reassurance following social conflict. Cultural differences in human-horse relationship have been evident from ancient history to the present. Two general approaches can be identified: 1) a co-operative approach based upon understanding the behaviour of the horse and 2) an alternative approach based on human dominance and equine submission. Management and training involving social interactions between humans and horses reflect these differences in approach. These can cause different types of conflict between the evolutionary and adaptive social needs of horses and the husbandry and training practices in both approaches. Current management and veterinary practices for horses are driven by human demands and economic limitations, but often ignore basic equine social needs. As a result - especially in the western world - intensive management of horses is frequently associated with social isolation, confinement. Concomitant alterations of feeding and foraging practices also violate the horse's physiological and <b>ethological</b> <b>needs.</b> Therefore, horses have to rely on human action in order to fulfil these needs, thus rendering the horse unable to exert control over its environment. In this environment, short term human-horse interactions have to substitute for natural and continuous horse to horse social bonding and interaction patterns. These common management practices have behavioural and physical consequences for the health and welfare of horses and also for human-horse interactions, husbandry practices and training. In this paper, behavioural, physical and stress parameters of both natural and equine husbandry systems, are reviewed and used to define social requirements and physiological and <b>ethological</b> <b>needs</b> for all phases of a horse’s life. In addition, implications for husbandry practices are critically reviewed. Preventive and curative interventions re proposed that offer welfare solutions, as well as practical and financial advantages. These include modification of traditional stable design, group housing and/or changes in daily management practices...|$|E

The animals were monitored during grasing season by force of metod ethology monitoring. Sheep and goats were monitored and it was done four times for always 24 hours during a grazing period. The method of the direct monitoring was used and the base categories of the behaviour (food intaking, lying, standing and moving) were written down by an interval method - the interval took 10 minutes. The comfortable, mother's, social and sexual behaviour were writen down as well. Gained data from single sighting was expressed absolute and percentage share form total tables and graphs. The results were interpreted {{on the basis of}} the study of special literature and legislation about organic farming and animal ethology.

40|$|Captive {{penguins}} {{are prone}} to pododermatitis (bumblefoot) lesions due to sedentary habits, changes in normal activity patterns, prolonged time on hard and abrasive surfaces, and less time swimming in the water. Environmental enrichment allows the use of creative and ingenious techniques that aim to keep the captive animals occupied by increasing the range and the diversity of behavioral opportunities always respecting the <b>ethological</b> <b>needs</b> of the species. The main goal of this work was to use environmental enrichment techniques to reduce pododermatitis {{in a group of}} captive penguins. Five captive Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) that were showing bumblefoot lesions were followed during this project. To monitor the lesions, all animals were physically restraint 3 times a week over a period of 12 weeks. Environmental enrichment was introduced daily in the water with the goal of enhancing their time in the water for one extra hour daily. The results demonstrate that in a twelve weeks period, four animals showed significant reduction of the lesions in both feet and in two animals the lesions were completely healed. With these results we can conclude that aquatic environmental enrichment allowed this group of penguins to spend more time in the water, favoring the reduction of the bumblefoot lesions...|$|E

The study focused on 201 school children, aged 9 - 11 years, who had no impairment. The project consisted of four 40 -minute meetings conducted by the authors in the classroom. Lessons discussed dogs, cats, and rabbits; the teaching modules focused on behavior, communication, and <b>ethological</b> <b>needs</b> of these species. Data were collected using 2 questionnaires, one preceding and the other following the project, formed by 31 items (20 identical and 11 different). Questionnaires were divided into areas comprising personal details of the children, their knowledge on animals, their perception of nonhuman animals, their responsibility toward pet species, their actual relationship with nonhuman animals. Data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon test (P, 0. 05) and a 2 -factor, repeated-measurement of analysis of variance (P, 0. 05). Comparisons before and after the lessons included the whole questionnaire and the identical questions, only. Analyses showed that attending the lessons led to the following positive results: a reduction of children’s fear of pets, an increase in knowledge and education of the animal world, an improvement of the children’s perception of animals, a possible improvement of the relationship with pets, a higher sense of responsibility toward animals, especially owned ones. Children who did not have a pet showed a proportionally higher improvement. Therefore, the prospect of integrating such teaching in to school syllabi is desirable...|$|E
40|$|In Italy, Law no. 189 / 2004 (enforced by law n. 201 / 2010) on {{safeguarding}} {{animal welfare}} establishes penalties for anyone keeping animals in {{conditions that are}} incompatible with their phy siological or <b>ethological</b> <b>needs.</b> Thus, in order to recognize the condition of poor welfare or mistreatment, the training of a veterinarian needs to adopt {{a new approach to}} animal well being —that is somewhat different from the health ideas that have been prevalent so far. In this research we carry out an evaluation of the competence of veterinary students after a theoric 20 -hour course in ethology and after three weeks of practical horses handling class. For two years 24 students were selected to took part in a program of horse management, in order to reach a high level of practical competence, from the ability to recognize non-verbal signals from horses, to cleaning and grooming, and to a more specific and refined ability—the establishment of a relationship with horse. While the skill level at the beginning was generally low, being the students’ backgrounds mainly urban, {{at the end of the}} practical course nearly 90 % of them succeeded in the area of horse-human relationship, reaching evaluations in a range of good-excellent scores (p < 0. 01). By combining over the years the applied ethology knowledge with the more profession-oriented health-related subjects, veterinary education will give students the resources that can better assist them in facing the challenges they will meet in their working lives.

40|$|In {{their native}} habitat of Central and South America, {{capuchin}} monkeys (Cebus) spend 45 % to 55 % {{of their day}} foraging and a further 20 % travelling. Once these monkeys are introduced into captive environments their diets are selective, seasonal and presented to them by their keepers. The captive environment often leads to various behavioural abnormalities and compensatory behaviours or stereotypies. To address this issue, environmental enrichment can be employed to reduce, cure or prevent such an occurrence. Enrichment can reduce stress, while increasing animal well-being and health in captivity. Despite previous work {{a better understanding of}} enrichment, for most neo-tropical primate species, is necessary, in order to improve their captive lifestyles. Feeding of captive primates is more complex than providing a balanced nutritional diet as it must also meet their <b>ethological</b> <b>needs.</b> The manipulation of the presentation of the diet has been shown to significantly decrease the incidence of resting, while significantly increasing the incidence of playing, grooming, foraging and manual manipulation of dietary items. Eleven capuchin monkeys were presented with four different feeding treatments (i. e. cut food presented in bowls, cut food presented around the enclosure, uncut food presented around the enclosure and novel feeding devices presented around the enclosure) from December 2007 until May 2008. At the start of every month one of three feeding treatments was introduced with the cut food in bowls feeding treatment interleaved between the treatments. The different feeding treatments required the monkeys to search for their food, break-up their food into manageable sizes, and obtain food in touch-, tool- and manipulative-dependent methods in order to allow the monkeys an opportunity to display increased activity more in line with their wild conspecifics. The capuchins displayed a period of intense foraging directly following feeding. This period significantly increased (from 44 to 121 min.), along with foraging events and the proportion of time spent foraging, which was more in line with their wild conspecifics. In addition, the frequency of occurrence and the proportion of time spent on locomotion and resting was shown to decrease. Also, abnormal behaviours ceased to occur during the study. Environmental enrichment is a useful tool for providing stimulation, redistributing activity levels more in line with wild conspecifics and to combat abnormal and compensatory behaviours...|$|E
40|$|The {{domestic}} rabbit is {{deprived of the}} protection of burrows and of a social hierarchy and live in a limited space which is {{a fraction of a}} metre of a hard sanitized space, removed from odours, markers and social interaction. Hot climate was the main cause for abnormal maternal and sexual behaviour. Exposure to high ambient temperature induces rabbits to try to balance their excessive heat load by using different means. The doe that was capable to produce 10 litters a year may give only 4 to 5 litters in hot climate Noise in rabitries causes adverse effects including nervous and behavioural abnormalities and can cause a startled response and traumatic injuries to limbs and back. Particularly, most concern about noise effects has traditionally focused on impairment of reproductive and maternal behaviours, although few controlled studies have been done to support the observations of animal caretakers that noise inhibits production. Moon phases are one of the main causes of abnormal sexual behaviour in females. Crowdness causes that rabbits become aggressive and bite one another during {{the first few days of}} nest sharing, while successive litters live together. Keeping rabbits singly in cages is not compatible with the demand of housing with respect to animal welfare, since the singly caged rabbit is exposed to natural external stimulus, has no social contact and has no conditions for suitable locomotion. This may be the reason in that caged rabbits show nervous behaviour and altered forms of movement and low relaxed resting-behaviour, that may be due to the narrowness of the cage and the wire floor. Social deprivation in rabbits interferes with the development of normal adult behaviours. However, among group-housed rabbits, survival at weaning was estimated to be 39 % instead of 87 % in individual cages. The behaviour and welfare of caged rabbit can be positively affected with repeated handling by familiar people. Minimal handling reduces timidity, particularly when performed during the first week of post-natal life. Higher growth rate and higher activity levels were recorded in rabbits handled daily for 10 minutes from 10 days to 10 weeks of age. Abuse and pushing the animals hard because of the method of production are cases in which the animals do not get optimal facilities necessary to fulfill their behavioural (<b>ethological)</b> <b>needs...</b>|$|E
40|$|Problem Statement: For the {{evaluation}} of cattle production sustainability researchers should not fail to carefully appraise the animal welfare and health concepts. Conditions, these latter, which in turn are directly linked to the functionality and appropriateness of areas dedicated to the cattle breeding. The planning of a beef barn with criteria that reduce the risk {{for the development of}} diseases stress correlated can contribute to the decrease of drug treatment and to the environmental sustainability of livestock production. Aim of the present work is to identify a model of barn that could optimize the animal welfare and health condition increasing the environment sustainability of beef farming. Methods: In order to plan a farm building model for beef sheltering, architectural aspects that mainly affect animal welfare, health and sustainability parameters were taken into account. Spaces were planned to assure freedom of movement of animals, according to their physiological and <b>ethological</b> <b>needs</b> as recommended by Dir. 98 / 58 /CE. The number and size of boxes and paddocks were prorated to the number of beef and functional groups reared. Spaces were designed in order to allow interaction and establishment of herd hierarchies. Given the influence of direct solar radiation on brightness and temperature, the mobility and insulation of walls was redefined. To fulfill the physiological needs (light/dark time period) and reduce behavioural atypias (aggressiveness), natural lighting was preferred. The natural ventilation system was planned to maintain an appropriate and constant microclimate into the shelters thanks to the control of air circulation, temperature, humidity and the abatement of toxic gases concentration generated from bedding. The selection of paving and bedding was based on their important role in decreasing foot injuries and respiratory diseases. The management of bedding has indeed a strong influence on a proper maturation of manure and gets to affect directly the cattle production sustainability. Results: The result of the project is a physical model of a beef barn (figure 1). Principle of functional planning of spaces, bioclimate and sustainability architecture, oriented to improve animal welfare and health, were applied to the stall design. The model has a longitudinal development on the east west axis, the south facing side can be completely opened, otherwise the north facing wall is closed and insulated with the stored straw. The building envelope is provided with a control system for solar radiation and ventilation (fixed and mobile protections) that can maximize the incoming solar radiation during the winter and can shade from the sun during the summer guaranteeing proper air circulation. The model is provided with mobile outwards opening and solar chimney for the ventilation. The building composition allows a good integration in the landscape. Conclusion: Thanks to a multidisciplinary approach, the research group has arrived to define a stall model that support a sustainable cattle production. Researchers with different expertise, veterinarians, architects and agronomist, worked together in order the propose a barn model that combine the economic requirements with the environmental sustainability and animal healt...|$|E
40|$|Feral {{horses are}} social animals, which {{have to rely}} on {{survival}} strategies centered on the formation of cohesive social bonds within their bands. Many problems in the husbandry of social animals such as horses, are {{due to the fact that}} the limits of their adaptive abilities are exceeded. Evidence suggests that the fundamental social characteristics of domestic horses have remained relatively unchanged. The social structure, social strategies and social interactions were investigated (3 non-consecutive years, 24 hr per day for several weeks) in long term established groups of domestic horses (mares and geldings of all ages) and a few small introduced groups, kept in (semi) natural environments. The general aim was to investigate the social needs of domestic horses. The social life of domestic horses was characterised by long lasting bonds with preferred partners which were established and maintained by allogrooming, play, proximity and dominance behaviours. Bonding partners were mainly found within the same sex-age group, but adult geldings also bonded with sub-adult mares and geldings. Adult mares were clustered in a group, while the other animals formed a second group. Among the adult mares, subgroups according to reproductive state were formed. Individuals regulated their social network by interfering with interactions between other members of the herd, which in itself is complex. An intervention is a behavioural action of one animal that actively interferes with an ongoing interaction between a dyad with the apparent aim of altering that interaction. This was verified by post-hoc analyses of disturbed and undisturbed interactions. Interventions in allogrooming or play were performed significantly more often when at least one member of the initial dyad was a preferred partner of, or familiar to (within the small introduced bands) the intervener. The stronger the preferred association in allogrooming between the intervener and member(s) of the initial dyad, the higher the probability the intervener would displace one initial member and continue allogrooming with the other. Just five behaviours were extracted which reliably reflected the dominance relations among horses. Aggression with the hind quarters was used both offensively and defensively and therefore not suitable as a reliable parameter. Individual dominance relationships were related to social experience. The implications of these findings for horse husbandry were assessed. It is argued that the execution of affiliative behaviours may be rewarding in itself, and therefore always will be a highly motivated behaviour. It is shown that social positive physical interactions (allogrooming, play) with other horses is an ethological need and therefore indispensable in modern husbandry systems. <b>Ethological</b> <b>needs</b> are so important for the animal that husbandry systems that lack the possibilities to execute such behaviours will cause chronic stress. It is concluded that all horses need physical social contact, and that horses, which lack appropriate social learning experiences during ontogeny, may be hampered in their social functioning later in life. Solutions for problems, including dominance problems, in individual social housing and group housing are presented...|$|E
40|$|How an animal’s {{behavioural}} (<b>ethological)</b> <b>needs</b> {{can be met}} is {{a pivotal}} issue {{in the assessment of}} welfare for captive animals. The value of swimming water for farmed mink is an example how scientific and societal questions relating to animal welfare can be answered. A number of studies have addressed the issue of the indispensability of swimming water for mink; however, so far with inconclusive evidence. In this paper, the results of these studies and related literature are reviewed. First, the biological definition of need is discussed. Subsequently, attention is paid to the effects of the presence, absence and the removal of swimming water on behavioural and physiological correlates of well-being including stereotypic and anticipatory behaviour and urinary cortisol. Thereafter we discuss individual differences in the use of swimming water, the price animals pay for access to a water bath, and the effect of access to swimming water on juvenile play. 	The main conclusions of the literature review are that 1) the use of a water bath for mink is most likely related to foraging behaviour (foraging areas: land and water); 2) absence of swimming water, without prior experience, does not lead to consistent changes in level of stereotypic behaviour, or anticipatory responses; 3) removal of a previously experienced water bath may induce short-term stress as indicated by behavioural parameters and elevated cortisol responses; 4) mink work hard for access to a swimming bath and running wheel in consumer demand studies. Other cage modifications such as tunnels and biting objects, may also provide environmental enrichment, if they are added to otherwise impoverished conditions; 5) There are individual differences in the use of swimming water: these are related in part to variation in prior experience of aquatic resources.; 6) As prior experience is important both with respect to individual use of swimming water and the response to deprivation, swimming water can not be described as biological need {{in the sense of a}} fixed requirement for survival. As swimming water appears to act as an incentive that induces its own motivation a more accurate term may be an “incentive induced or environmentally facilitated need”. Given the available evidence, it is not possible to conclude whether mink that have never experienced swimming water, suffer as a consequence of its absence. However, it is possible to predict that mink with access to water have improved quality of life, due to increased behavioural opportunities, in comparison to farmed mink without access to swimming water. In practical terms, it is still open to debate whether mink should be provided with swimming water, or if alternative, less valued, but easier to install and maintain forms of environmental enrichment, should be provided in mink housing. To clarify these issues a number of future studies would be valuable. These include; 1) whether specific environmental cues affect motivation to swim, such as the form of drinking water delivery systems; 2) whether prior experience of swimming water affects its incentive value; in other words “can you miss what you never experienced?”; 3) do behavioural parameters such as stereotypic behaviour; rebound effects and vacuum activity have any general utility in assessing the value of absent resources; 4) what are preferences for and the value of alternative resources which may act as substitutes for swimming water. In addition we would recommend further work investigating: relationship between access to swimming water and positive indicators of welfare such as play and/or anticipatory behaviour; the effects of preventing the performance of rewarding behaviours and deprivation of a previous experienced resource; and health and hygeine issues related to provision of a water bath. In future work, it would be desirable to present be the actual percentages of animals using a water bath during the experiment and the use of power analyses, to aid their interpretation...|$|E
