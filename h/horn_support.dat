5000|$|This track uses several {{tactics to}} evoke its images of slavery. Alisa White {{describes}} how the 5/4 time signature of the track adds an intense percussive hit, played either by a tambourine or as a rimshot, on the first beat of each measure. The track does not deviate from this pattern, which White writes, [...] "conjures up images of forced labor," [...] specifically a cracked whip. Additionally, the track is played in a blues form that is only six bars long, however this is found in pairs, so that each chorus is actually twelve bars long. Abbey Lincoln {{is the first to}} enter the tune, singing the melody a cappella and accompanying herself with tambourine. Coleman Hawkins then enters with the tenor saxophone melody, along with the three <b>horns</b> <b>supporting</b> him. After a chorus of instrumental melody, Hawkins takes a 4 chorus solo.

40|$|Our {{objective}} was to produce avascular, myofibroblast-rich tissue capsules for use as autologous grafts for hollow, smooth muscle-walled visceral organs-bladder, uterus and vas deferens. To produce tissue for grafting, templates of the appropriate shape were implanted in the peritoneal cavities of rats or rabbits. After 2 - 3 weeks, the templates were removed, the encapsulating myofibroblast-rich tissue harvested and grafted to replace resected segments of bladder, vas deferens or uterus of the same animals in which the tissue was grown. Bladder grafts showed 100 % patency after 14 months and had developed a morphology similar to normal bladder. Tubes of myofibroblast tissue grafted unilaterally into resected rabbit vasa deferentia developed a morphology resembling native tissue, with sperm in the ejaculate indicative of normal function. At 12 weeks after grafting, uterine graft tissue had increased in thickness and developed the morphology of normal uterus, with endometrium overlying several layers of smooth muscle cells (myometrium-like) which were interspersed with collagen fibrils; grafted uterine <b>horns</b> <b>supported</b> embryos to the late stages of gestation. This study shows that myofibroblast tissue produced in the peritoneal cavity is sufficiently plastic to permit differentiation of cells into bladder, vas deferens or uterine smooth muscle. As a method for producing autologous graft material for repair/replacement of these organs, this approach has many benefits over conventional and current tissue-engineering strategies.

40|$|We {{discuss and}} present new data {{regarding}} the physiological and molecular mechanisms of nuclear receptor activation in pain control, {{with a particular}} emphasis on non-genomic effects of ligands at peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), GPR 30, and classical estrogen receptors. PPARα agonists rapidly reduce both acute and chronic pain {{in a number of}} pain assays. These effects precede transcriptional anti-inflammatory actions, and are mediated in part by IK ca and BK ca channels on DRG neurons. In contrast to the peripheral site of action of PPARα ligands, the dorsal <b>horn</b> <b>supports</b> the expression of PPARγ. Intrathecal administration of PPARγ ligands rapidly (≤ 5  min) attenuated mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity associated with nerve injury in a dose-dependent manner that could be blocked with PPARγ antagonists. By contrast, a PPARγ antagonist itself rapidly increased the mechanical allodynia associated with nerve injury. These data suggest that ligand-dependent, non-genomic activation of spinal PPARγ decreases behavioral signs of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. We also report that the GPR 30 is expressed on cultured sensory neurons, that activation of the receptor elicits signaling to increase calcium accumulation. This signaling may contribute to increased neuronal sensitivity as treatment with the GPR 30 agonist induces hyperalgesia. Finally, application of the membrane-impermeable 17 β-E 2 -BSA rapidly (within 15  min) enhanced BK-stimulated inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation and PGE 2 -mediated cAMP accumulation in trigeminal ganglion cultures. We conclude that nuclear receptor ligands may operate through rapid, non-genomic mechanisms to modulate inflammatory and neuropathic pain. © 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Persistent pain {{produces}} complex {{alterations in}} sensory pathways {{of the central}} nervous system (CNS) through activation of various nociceptive mechanisms. However, the effects of pain on higher brain centers, particularly the influence of the stressful component of pain on the limbic system, are poorly understood. Neurokinin- 1 (NK- 1) receptors and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), known neuromediators of hyperalgesia and spinal central sensitization, have also been implicated in the plasticity and neurodegeneration occurring in the hippocampal formation during exposures to various stressors. Results of this study showed that injections of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into the hind paw increased NK- 1 receptor and BDNF mRNA levels in the ipsilateral dorsal <b>horn,</b> <b>supporting</b> an important role for these nociceptive mediators in the amplification of ascending pain signaling. An opposite effect was observed in the hippocampus, where CFA down-regulated NK- 1 receptor and BDNF gene expression, phenomena previously observed in immobilization models of stress and depression. Western blot analyses demonstrated that in the spinal cord, CFA also increased levels of phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), while in the hippocampus the activation of this transcription factor was significantly reduced, further suggesting that tissue specific transcription of either NK- 1 or BDNF genes may be partially regulated by common intracellular transduction mechanisms mediated through activation of CREB. These findings suggest that persistent nociception induces differential regional regulation of NK- 1 receptor and BDNF gene expression and CREB activation in the CNS, potentially reflecting varied roles of these neuromodulators in the spinal cord during persistent sensory activation vs. modulation of the higher brain structures such as the hippocampus...|$|R
