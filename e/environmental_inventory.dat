40|$|Objectives: To {{examine the}} psychometric {{properties}} of the Nottwil <b>Environmental</b> Factors <b>Inventory</b> Short Form using Rasch analysis; to determine its construct validity and internal consistency; and to develop a metric for scoring. Design: Cross-sectional psychometric study. Construct validity of the Nottwil <b>Environmental</b> Factors <b>Inventory</b> Short Form, including model fit, person and item fit, local item dependence, dimensionality, and differential item functioning (DIF), was investigated with Rasch analysis. Internal consistency was assessed with Cronbach alpha and item-total correlations. Setting: Community. Participants: Swiss residents aged > 16 years and living with traumatic or nontraumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) (NZ 1549). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measure: The Nottwil <b>Environmental</b> Factors <b>Inventory</b> Short Form, a 14 -item questionnaire developed to assess perceived impact of environmental barriers on participation. Results: Local dependencies between items addressing a similar content could be solved by creating a testlet. With 1 testlet there was strong evidence for unidimensionality of the Nottwil <b>Environmental</b> Factors <b>Inventory</b> Short Form. Although person-item targeting revealed a floor effect, indicating few perceived environmental barriers to participation in the Swiss SCI population, the item fit was good. Only a few items presented DIF. The Nottwil <b>Environmental</b> Factors <b>Inventory</b> Short Form showed good internal consistency (aZ. 82).

40|$|Unmanned aerial {{vehicles}} {{are increasingly being}} used in close range photogrammetry. Real-time observation of the Earth’s surface and the photogrammetric images obtained are used as material for surveying and <b>environmental</b> <b>inventory.</b> The following study was conducted on a small area (approximately 1 ha). In such cases, the classical method of topographic mapping is not accurate enough. The geodetic method of topographic surveying, on the other hand, is an overly precise measurement technique {{for the purpose of}} inventorying the natural environment components. The author of the following study has proposed using the unmanned aerial vehicle technology and tying in the obtained images to the control point network established with the aid of GNSS technology. Georeferencing the acquired images and using them to create a photogrammetric model of the studied area enabled the researcher to perform calculations, which yielded a total root mean square error below 9 cm. The performed comparison of the real lengths of the vectors connecting the control points and their lengths calculated {{on the basis of the}} photogrammetric model made it possible to fully confirm the RMSE calculated and prove the usefulness of the UAV technology in observing terrain components for the purpose of <b>environmental</b> <b>inventory.</b> Such environmental components include, among others, elements of road infrastructure, green areas, but also changes in the location of moving pedestrians and vehicles, as well as other changes in the natural environment that are not registered on classical base maps or topographic maps...|$|E

40|$|Energy use and {{emission}} {{factors for}} passenger transportation modes typically ignore the total <b>environmental</b> <b>inventory</b> which includes vehicle non-operational components (e. g., vehicle manufacturing and maintenance), infrastructure components, and fuel production components from design through end-of-life processes. A life-cycle inventory {{for each mode}} is necessary to appropriately address and attribute the transportation sector’s energy and emissions impacts to reduction goals instead of allowing tailpipe emissions to act as indicators of total system performance. The contributions of U. S. passenger transportation modes to national energy and emissions inventories account for roughly 20 % of U. S. totals, mostly attributed to gasoline consumption. Furthermore, world consumption of primary energy amounted to 490 EJ in 2005 with the U. S. responsible for 110 EJ, or 21 % of the total. This means that passenger transportation in the U. S. accounts for roughly 5 % of global primary energy consumption annually. With a predominant fossil fuel energy base, the impacts of U. S. passenger transportation have strong implications for global energy consumption, U. S. energy security, and climate change. Furthermore, criteria air pollutant emissions from transportation (passenger and freight) are also significant, accounting for 78 % of national CO...|$|E
40|$|Five rapid visual stream {{assessment}} {{methods were}} applied to 65 restored streams in North Carolina, {{and the results were}} correlated with measured macroinvertebrate community metrics to evaluate predictive ability. The USEPA Rapid Bioassessment Protocol (RBP), USDA Stream Visual Assessment Protocol (SVAP), Peterson’s Riparian Channel and <b>Environmental</b> <b>Inventory</b> (RCE), NCSU Eco-Geomorphological Assessment (EGA), and NCSU Stream Performance Assessment (SPA) were applied by teams with expertise in hydrology, fluvial geomorphology, and aquatic ecology. Predictions of most macroinvertebrate metrics were improved by re-weighting assessment variables using principal component analysis (PCA) and including watershed factors (e. g., size, slope, land use). The correlations of EGA, RCE, SPA and SVAP assessment results to macroinvertebrate metrics were most improved by variable re-weighting using PCA, while the correlations of RBP were most improved by adding watershed parameters. Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) indicates that PCA re-weighting including watershed parameters improves the predictor model for the total number of dominant EPT taxa more than using the sum total raw points for all five assessment methods. To demonstrate the application of the study results, a single-value index was generated for the RBP method using principal component regression (PCR) based on the EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera) taxa metric...|$|E
40|$|A WHO and UNICEF {{joint report}} states that in 2008, 884 million people lacked access to potable {{drinking}} water. A life-cycle approach to develop potable water systems may improve the sustainability for such systems, however, {{a review of}} the literature shows that such an approach has primarily been used for urban systems located in resourced countries. Although urbanization is increasing globally, over 40 percent of the world’s population is currently rural with many considered poor. In this paper, we present a first step towards using life-cycle assessment to develop sustainable rural water systems in resource-limited countries while pointing out the needs. For example, while there are few differences in costs and environmental impacts for many improved rural water system options, a system that uses groundwater with community standpipes is substantially lower in cost that other alternatives with a somewhat lower <b>environmental</b> <b>inventory.</b> However, a LCA approach shows that from institutional as well as community and managerial perspectives, sustainability includes many other factors besides cost and environment that are a function of the interdependent decision process used across the life cycle of a water system by aid organizations, water user committees, and household users. These factors often present the biggest challenge to designing sustainable rural water systems for resource-limited countries...|$|E
40|$|Recently more {{emphasis}} {{has been placed}} on the importance of variables that mediate person-environment relations. This paper describes the <b>Environmental</b> Appraisal <b>Inventory</b> (EAI), which is designed to measure three dimensions of environmental appraisal: (a) threat to self; (b) threat to the environment posed by environmental hazards, and (c) perceived control over environmental hazards. Hazards ranging from proximate indoor threats (e. g., office fumes) to large-scale outdoor threats (e. g., earthquakes) are included. Internal consistency of the EAI is more than adequate. Convergent and discriminant validity is explored using McKechnie's (1974) <b>Environmental</b> Response <b>Inventory</b> and Rotter's (1966) Internal-External Locus of Control scale. Perceived control over the physical environment as measured by the EAI appears to be distinct from Rotter's measure.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test the effect of {{agricultural}} and forestry land use on the structure of mayfly assemblages in low-order streams. Twenty-nine headwater streams were investigated in the state of S&# 227;o Paulo. We analyzed 15 streams in pristine areas (mixed tropical rainforest, semideciduous forest and dense tropical rainforest), and 14 streams covered with sugarcane, eucalyptus and pasture. Mayfly richness obtained by rarefaction curves was higher in pristine areas (21 genera), especially in mixed and semideciduous forest when compared to land use (9 genera), where values were particularly low in sugarcane plantation (3 genera). The non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination showed clear difference in mayfly assemblages between land uses and pristine areas, supported by analysis of similarity (R= 0. 67, p= 0. 001). In partial redundancy analysis (pRDA), the environmental descriptors that best explained differences in assemblage structure were Riparian, Channel and <b>Environmental</b> <b>Inventory</b> (RCE) index score, percentage of fine sediment stream substrate, water pH and land elevation. Our results show that agricultural and forestry land use has a strong negative effect on the structure of mayfly assemblages.

The help-seeking and peer learning behaviors of 197 students were measured through pre- and post-surveys using modified peer learning and help-seeking subscales from the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ). These students also answered an online collaboration survey identifying those they collaborated with during the sustainability module. Their academic performance was examined with two measures, scores on the Environmental Knowledge (Life Cycle Assessment survey) and a game prototype/presentation (n= 96). Nine students from the study sample participated in qualitative interviews and completed a name interpreter survey that provided them with an opportunity to share additional information about their perceptions regarding the relationships between the individuals named in their networks. The networks of the interviewed students were analyzed using the NetDraw and UCINET software packages. ^ Pearson correlations were calculated in order to examine the relationships between students 2 ̆ 7 reported peer-learning and help-seeking behaviors scores and the game prototype/presentation scores, the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Inventory</b> (LCA knowledge) scores, {{and the size of the}}ir collaborative networks. There was a small positive correlation between seeking help from teammates and students 2 ̆ 7 performance on the more open-ended task of creating the LCA game prototype/presentation [...] No relationship was found between reported peer-learning and help-seeking behaviors and students 2 ̆ 7 performance on the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Inventory</b> (LCA knowledge) scores. These results suggest students tended not to seek help from others when learning basic content related to sustainability as measured by the LCA exam, because they perceived the content to be easy. However, more help-seeking was positively associated with better performance on the more open-ended and applied task of developing a game prototype related to LCA content. There was a small positive relationship found between reported peer-learning and help-seeking behaviors with teammates and the size of the student collaborative network. This relationship implies that students who demonstrated more peer learning and help-seeking behaviors with teammates tended to have somewhat larger networks. ^ This research also examined the relationship between the structure of the student 2 ̆ 7 s ego network and their academic performance. The structure of the student 2 ̆ 7 s ego network had no clear relationship to his or her academic performance. However, the student 2 ̆ 7 s ability to access social capital embedded in their relations with others—i. e. information, encouragement, and help from others when needed—greatly influenced the extent to which he or she was able to complete the LCA assignments. Social capital encompasses facilitative actions such as the development of reciprocity, individual problem solving capacity, and is a moderator of group productivity and creativity. ...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePurpose: Environmental {{data for}} steel {{products}} are generally proposed at a continental or a global scale. The question we are tackling here is: does {{the fact that}} steel as a global market necessarily reduces the need for national data? Methods: In this study, {{the environmental impact of}} reinforcing steel sold in France is evaluated. To do so, a specific <b>environmental</b> <b>inventory</b> is adapted from Ecoinvent database. CML method is used for impact calculation and both methods "recycled content" as well as "end of life recycling approach" are tested. Results and discussion: This study shows that there is a specificity of reinforcing steel products sold in France compared to European value. It {{is due to the fact}} that reinforcing steel is mainly made with recycled steel as the market growth for construction product in France is limited allowing a very high recycled content. This result is not sensitive neither to the allocation method used for recycling (cut-off approach or system expansion) nor to transport distance and electricity country mix used. Conclusions: The result of this study can be used with confidence in every construction site work located on the French territory. Furthermore, the present study advocates for an adaptation of global database to local context defined by a specific industrial sector and a geographic region even for product such as steel that may be considered as a first approximation as a global product. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - This paper aims {{to analyse}} the factors {{influencing}} refurbishment site managers' waste management efforts. Design/methodology/approach - Twenty-seven semi-structured interviews were held with managers from two large contractors involved in housing and office refurbishment projects in Sweden. Also, a web and postal questionnaire survey {{was sent to}} 232 refurbishment site managers and received a 34 per cent response rate. Findings - Site managers devise waste management strategies based on <b>environmental</b> <b>inventories</b> and project size. In smaller projects, waste contractors are employed only for physical activities rather than providing advice. Site managers' waste management efforts are influenced by project-related factors, organizational and personal factors, technical factors, industry culture and legislation. The level of contract detail, specific client demands related to waste management and project size are important factors. Practical implications - Policies and guidelines for projects of different sizes should be developed at least for large contractors; scale influences site managers' waste strategies. Waste management efforts in refurbishment projects can be improved by addressing simple technical problems including providing clear labelling of containers and ensuring shelter fromrain and snow. Originality/value - This is a pioneer survey of refurbishment site manager opinions and practices. Inefficient waste management in building refurbishment projects can be costly and harmful to the environment. There are many opportunities to improve waste management efforts...|$|R
