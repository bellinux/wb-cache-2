40|$|Our aim is {{to propose}} a multi-dimensional {{operator}} framework that provides a bridge between approximation theory (in particular, the construction of polyharmonic splines and wavelets) and the investigation of self-similar stochastic processes. Our investigation starts with {{the identification of the}} linear differential operators that are translation-, scale- and rotation-invariant; these are the fractional Laplacians (−∆) γ 2 with γ ∈ R+, which are best specified as Fourier-domain multipliers (Duchon, 1977). The corresponding family is endowed with a semi-group property. To make this state-ment precise, we must characterize the action of the fractional operators (boundedness, decay properties) on appropriate function spaces and also unambiguously specify the in-verse operators. The mathematical difficulty is that: (1) the null space of the fractional Laplacians is non-empty (but finite-dimensional), and, (2) the inversion involves singular integral operators that need to be regularized. Having mastered the underlying operator algebra, we define our signals of interest s as the solutions of a fractional differential equation with an appropriate <b>excitation</b> <b>r...</b>|$|E

For the {{condensate}} side it is shown that in this limit the four-quark condensate factorizes also for the finite density case. At the hadronic side the medium dependence is expressed in terms of the current-nucleon forward scattering amplitude. Generalizing vector meson dominance we allow for a direct coupling of the current to the nucleon as well as a coupling via the rho meson. We discuss the N_c dependence of (a) modifications of the pion cloud of the rho meson, (b) mixing with other mesons (in particular a_ 1 and omega) and (c) resonance-hole <b>excitations</b> <b>R</b> N^{- 1 }. We show that only the last effect survives in the large-N_c limit. Saturating the sum rules with a simple hadronic ansatz which allows for the excitation of the D_{ 13 }(1520) we determine the coupling of the latter to the rho-nucleon and the photon-nucleon system.

Theoretical predictions concerning the chaotic threshold in parameter space are deduced from the application of Melnikov's method that fully determine the chaos-control scenario. Also, the structure of diverse regularization regions in parameter space is explained theoretically with the aid of an energy analysis. It was found that the phase difference between the two periodic excitations involved plays a crucial role in the chaos-control scenario, with the particular feature that its optimal value depends upon the ratio between the damping coefficient and the excitation frequency. This constitutes a genuine feature of the chaos-control scenario associated with nonsteady potentials which is in contrast to the case of steady potentials. Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness of the chaos-control scenario against the presence of low-intensity Gaussian noise and reshaping of chaos-suppressing <b>excitations.</b> <b>R.</b> C. and J.

Furthermore, unmixing, which is usually performed on emission image sequences, is performed on these excitation image sequences. We use factor analysis of medical image sequences (FAMIS), which produces factor images, to unmix spectral image sequences of stained structures in tissue sections to provide images of characterized stained cellular structures. This new approach is applied to histological tissue sections of mouse aorta containing labeled iron nanoparticles stained with Texas Red and counterstained with SYTO 13, to obtain visual information about the accumulation of these nanoparticles in the arterial wall.

This proceeds in four parts; physical modeling, linear system identification, nonlinear analysis, and validation test design. It is shown how the nonlinear tools of describing functions, bifurcation methods and manifold analysis assist in developing a simple nonlinear model capable of describing the data and consistent with physical understanding. The system being modeled is a lean gas turbine combustor which exhibits a sustained mid-range (100 – 1000 Hz) limit cycle instability. The closed-loop experimental data does not contain a sufficiently rich spectrum for confident modeling in the first linear system identification phase. Despite the paucity of information available, a grey-box nonlinear model is created and parametrized which provides an explanation both of the limit-cycle fundamental oscillation and of a high frequency nonharmonic signal also present. The model structure is explored and various operating conditions simulated to understand the model better. The validation and=or refinement of this model is then considered.

Abstract- The behaviour {{of nuclear}} matter penetrated by a nucleon is {{considered in the}} hydrodynamic approximation. 1. For the nuclear processes with the large energy and momentum transfer while the great number degrees of freedom is excited the statistical aspects are dominant. At the same time different collective variables are observed and measured.

At low energy <b>excitations</b> (— <b>r</b> — ~ 10 MeV) time dependent mean field approxima-tion seems to be well applicable and two body collisions between quasiparticles can be assumed negligible [2].

Using a very broadband continuum probe, the generation of the R 3 B neutral radical is observed (430 nm) as well as the ground state bleach (550 nm), an excited state absorption (445 nm), and stimulated emission (620 nm).

The index theorem provides more refined data than the APS index for an instanton on R 4 and reproduces it in decompactification limit. In the R 3 limit, it reduces to the Callias index theorem. The index is expressed in terms of topological charge and the η-invariant associated with the boundary Dirac operator. Neither topological charge nor η-invariant is typically an integer, however, the non-integer parts cancel to give an integer-valued index. Our derivation is based on axial current non-conservation—an exact operator identity valid on any four-manifold— and on the existence of a center symmetric, or approximately center symmetric, boundary holonomy (Wilson line). We expect the index theorem to usefully apply to many physical systems of interest, such as low temperature (large S 1, confined) phases of gauge theories, center stabilized Yang-Mills theories with vector-like or chiral matter (at S 1 of any size), and supersymmetric gauge theories with supersymmetry-preserving boundary conditions (also at any S 1). In QCD-like and chiral gauge theories, the index theorem should shed light into the nature of topological excitations responsible for chiral symmetry breaking and the generation of mass gap in the gauge sector. We also show that imposing chirally-twisted boundary condition in gauge theories with fermions induces a Chern-Simon...|$|R
40|$|According to Keldysh and Silin (l), electron-hole {{droplets}} (2, 3) (EHD) in {{a magnetic}} field have a field dependent oscillating equilibrium density, due to OS-cillating contributions to the free energy (4). This oscillating density causes in-tensity oscillations of the EHD luminescence in Ge (5, 6). In this paper, we {{for the first time}} present time dependent measurements of the intensity oscillations of the TA-phonon assisted line at 729 meV. They show characteristic differences com-pared to the LA-assisted line (709 meV) which was investigated in a previous paper (7). As we can show, these differences are {{due to the fact that}} the TA-as-sisted radiative transition is a forbidden one at the band extrema (8). The experi-ments were carried out on Ge samples with an impurity concentration of about 1 0 l 2 ~ m- ~. The samples were immersed in liquid helium which was pumped to about 1. 5 K. For ca r r i e <b>r</b> <b>excitation</b> a pulsed GaAs laser was used with a peak power of about 5 W, pulse length of 2 ps, and duty factor of 0. 2 %.

SERS spectra were obtained, exciting samples in picogram quantities on specific substrates, starting from standard commercial solutions. The main vibrational features of each substance were clearly identified also in low quantities. The amount of the sampled substance was determined through the analysis of scanning electron microscope images, while the spectral resolution and the detector sensitivity were sufficiently high to clearly distinguish spectra belonging to different samples with an exposure time of 10 s. A principal component analysis procedure was applied to the experimental data to understand which are the main factors affecting spectra variation across different samples. The score plots for the first three principal components show that the examined explosive materials can be clearly classified {{on the basis of their}} SERS spectra...|$|R
40|$|Fluorescence {{diagnosis}} {{may be used}} {{to improve}} the safety and reliability of stereotactic brain tumor biopsies using biopsy needles with integrated fiber optics. Based on 5 -aminolevulinic-acid-induced protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) fluorescence, vital tumor tissue can be localized in vivo during the excision procedure {{to reduce the number of}} necessary samples for a reliable diagnosis. In this study, the practical suitability of two different PpIX excitation wavelengths (405  nm, 633  nm) was investigated on optical phantoms. Violet excitation at 405  nm provides a 50 -fold higher sensitivity for the bulk tumor; this factor increases up to 100 with decreasing fluorescent volume as shown by ray tracing simulations. <b>Red</b> <b>excitation</b> at 633  nm, however, is noticeably superior with regard to blood layers obscuring the fluorescence. Experimental results on the signal attenuation through blood layers of well-defined thicknesses could be confirmed by ray tracing simulations. Typical interstitial fiber probe measurements were mimicked on agarose-gel phantoms. Even in direct contact, blood layers of 20 - 40  µm between probe and tissue must be expected, obscuring 405 -nm-excited PpIX fluorescence almost completely, but reducing the 633 -nm-excited signal only by 25. 5 %. Thus, 633  nm seems to be the wavelength of choice for PpIX-assisted detection of high-grade gliomas in stereotactic biopsy.

30|$|In addition, the power-dependent {{behavior}} of R (or Γ) could imply the potential hole trapping PC mechanism. The unintentionally doped V 2 O 5 semiconductor {{has been confirmed}} to exhibit n-type conducting[6, 22, 39]. Under low power density, the photoexcited holes are totally captured by certain defects which function as a hole trap. The hole trapping effect leaves unpaired electrons which exhibit a long lifetime (τ). As photocurrent is linearly dependent on carrier lifetime, i.e., ip ∝ τ, the long-lifetime electron will substantially enhance and dominate the photocurrent generation. As the τ of electron which is decided by the hole trapping time is now a constant, R (or Γ) will be independent of the <b>excitation</b> power, i.e., <b>R</b> (or Γ) = const. Once the power exceeds a critical value (trap filling intensity), the photogenerated hole density {{is much higher than}} the trap density and the traps will be fully occupied. Under this condition, the trapping effect can be ignored and photocarriers will follow the bimolecular recombination mechanism[40 – 42]. The recombination after trap filling results in the decrease of τ with the increase of I, making an intensity-dependent R (or Γ) following an inverse power law, i.e., R (or Γ) ∝ I-k, where the theoretical k = 1 / 2 [42]. The aforementioned model agrees with the two-stage power-dependent R (or Γ) result in Figure  2 c and ip in Figure  2 b. The trap filling intensity is roughly at 5 W m- 2, and the fitted k value is 0.62 ± 0.04 for the V 2 O 5 NWs.|$|R
40|$|We {{present results}} of near [...] IR long-slit {{spectroscopy}} in the J and K bands of the Seyfert 2 galaxies NGC 2110 and Circinus, investigating the gaseous distribution, excitation, reddening and kinematics. In NGC 2110, the emission line ratio [FeII]/Pa beta increases towards the nucleus (to ~ 7). The nuclear [Fe II] 1. 257 (microns) and Pa beta lines are broader (FWHM ~ 500 km/s) than the H 2 (2. 121) line (FWHM ~ 300 km/s). Both {{these results suggest}} that shocks, driven by the radio jet, are an important source of excitation of [Fe II]. The H 2 excitation appears to be dominated by X-rays from the nucleus. In Circinus, both [FeII]/Pa beta and H 2 /Br gamma decrease from ~ 2 at 4 arcsec from the nucleus to nuclear values of ~ 0. 6 and ~ 1, respectively, suggesting that the starburst dominates the nuclear excitation, while the AGN dominates the <b>excitation</b> further out (<b>r</b> > 2 arcsec). For both galaxies, the gaseous kinematics are consistent with circular rotation in the plane of the disk. Our rotation curves suggest that the nucleus (identified with the peak of the IR continuum) is displaced from the kinematic centre of the galaxies. This effect has been observed previously in NGC 2110 based on the kinematics of optical emission lines, but the displacement is smaller in the infrared, suggesting the effect is related to obscuration. The continuum J-K colours of the nuclear region indicate a red stellar population in NGC 2110 and a reddened young stellar population in Circinus. Right at the nucleus of both galaxies, the colours are redder, apparently a result of hot dust emission from the inner edge of a circumnuclear torus.

40|$|ATP is {{released}} during hypoxia from the ventrolateral medulla (VLM) and activates purinergic P 2 receptors (P 2 Rs) at unknown loci {{to offset the}} secondary hypoxic depression of breathing. In this study, we used rhythmically active medullary slices from neonatal rat to map,inrelationtoanatomicalandmolecularmarkersofthepre-Bötzingercomplex(preBötC) (aproposedsiteofrhythmgeneration),the effects of ATP on respiratory rhythm and identify the P 2 R subtypes responsible for these actions. Unilateral microinjections of ATP in a three-dimensional grid within the VLM revealed a “hotspot ” where ATP (0. 1 mM) evoked a rapid 2. 2 � 0. 1 -fold increase in inspiratory frequency followed by a brief reduction to 0. 83 � 0. 02 of baseline. The hotspot was identified as the preBötC based on histology, overlap of injection sites with NK 1 R immunolabeling, and potentiation or inhibition of respiratory frequency by SP ([Sar 9 -Met(O 2) 11]-substance P) or DAMGO ([D-Ala 2,N-MePhe 4,Gly-ol 5]-enkephalin), respectively. The relative potency of P 2 R agonists [2 MeSADP (2 methylthioadenosine 5 �-diphosphate) � 2 MeSATP (2 -methylthioadenosine 5 �-triphosphate) � ATP�s (adenosine 5 �-[�thio]triphosphate tetralithium salt) � ATP � � UTP � ��meATP (�,�-methylene-adenosine 5 �-triphosphate) ] and attenuation of the ATP response by MRS 2179 (2 �-deoxy-N 6 -methyladenosine- 3 �, 5 �-bisphosphate) (P 2 Y 1 antagonist) indicate that the excitation is mediated by P 2 Y 1 Rs. The post-ATP inhibition, which was never observed in response to ATP�s, is dependent on ATP hydrolysis. These data establish in neonatal rats that respiratory rhythm generating networks in the preBötC are exquisitely sensitive to P 2 Y 1 R activation, and suggest a role for P 2 Y 1 Rs in respiratory motor control, particularly in the P 2 <b>R</b> <b>excitation</b> of rhythm that occurs during hypoxia...|$|R
