2500|$|This Thielvar {{had a son}} called Hafthi. And Hafthi's {{wife was}} called Whitestar. Those two {{were the first to}} settle on Gotland. The first night they slept {{together}} she dreamt that three snakes were coiled in her lap. And <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> they slid out of her lap. She told this dream to her husband Hafthi. He interpreted it thus: ...|$|E
60|$|Still he stood, and <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> her father's gaze pierced to {{her secret}} soul.|$|E
60|$|Margaret {{looked across}} the table curiously. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> her friend had turned a little paler.|$|E
60|$|To {{reasoning}} of such {{tone and}} consequence Jeanie had nothing <b>to</b> reply, although <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> contain fully as much self-importance as truth.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{beyond the}} desert {{of a woman}} {{that she should be}} privileged to participate....|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as if {{this first}} vision of death must alter the {{daylight}} for her for evermore.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} her {{steadily}} and <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> his eyes were on fire with evil things.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked into}} her eyes almost fearfully, but <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> his own held a first glimmer of hope.|$|E
60|$|As {{he did so}} she {{had started}} to her feet, listening. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> there was someone near them.|$|E
60|$|Miriam {{could not}} help {{touching}} the eggs, and his hand which, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> cradled them so well.|$|R
60|$|This figure took <b>her</b> imagination; <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> very beautiful; and his praise humbled {{her more}} and more.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as if ages {{had passed}} in this way, when one evening two letters were brought in.|$|R
60|$|She {{gave him}} a glance. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{whatever}} it was, his presence would help her to bear it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ralph Denham said that?" [...] said Katharine, with {{considerable}} indignation. In {{order to have}} produced such suffering in Mary, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> he must have behaved with extreme callousness. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> he had discarded the friendship, when it suited his convenience to do so, with some falsely philosophical theory which made his conduct all the worse. She was going on to express herself thus, had not Mary at once interrupted her.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> his frame {{had become}} tenser, his tone harder. The grip {{of his fingers}} was still upon her wrist.|$|E
60|$|And as {{she looked}} out on the sea from <b>her</b> narrow window, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> dismally gray, moaning, restless, and dreary.|$|R
60|$|She {{very much}} {{wanted to look at}} him, but she would not. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> quite a time before he replied.|$|R
6000|$|Almost <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as if {{father and}} brother were {{standing}} by her side, as she knelt and prayed.--Oh! how she prayed! ...|$|R
60|$|So {{she took}} the gourd and drank to the last drop, for <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> she had never tasted {{anything}} so delicious.|$|E
60|$|Ruth got up quickly. She {{was glad}} to get away, for <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> in another minute she would break down altogether.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{nothing of}} this was real, but all some horrid dream. A clap of thunder made her cover her ears.|$|E
60|$|Elspeth {{discovered}} that guns cost fourpence, and dominoes threepence halfpenny; <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> therefore, that Tommy was defrauding {{her of a}} halfpenny.|$|R
6000|$|... "I forgot {{you were}} driving to-day," [...] she replied, {{and looked away}} from him. There was a moment's pause--long, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{natural that}} he should be {{thinking}} only of himself, but with the subtlest defensive instinct, she put forward her own tragedy: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{it was she}} {{that they}} were {{laughing}} at, pointing her out to one another, jeering at her, reviling her, threatening her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Where is Mr. Nicholas?" [...] she asked. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> Fillmore was {{the only}} {{possible}} source of information. [...] "Did you say he was out?" ...|$|E
60|$|He moved {{a little}} uneasily. All {{the time she}} was {{watching}} him. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> she could read the thoughts which were stirring in his brain.|$|E
60|$|Ann tried <b>to</b> laugh. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> an age {{before she}} {{produced}} any sound at all, {{and when it}} came it was quite unlike a laugh.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> a great {{piece of}} luck {{that he had}} found that out. It made {{everything}} easy at once, and her words came out pell-mell.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Harsh discipline, I fear, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> poor child,' said Honor; 'but {{she is so}} excitable that I {{must try}} <b>to</b> keep <b>her</b> as quiet as possible.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> she {{was very}} much alone now. She was marooned on a desert island of froth and laughter. Everything that mattered she had lost.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because," [...] replied Jane. And {{she found}} it strangely {{embarrassing}} to meet the child's gaze. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> Fay's violet eyes looked through her with piercing wisdom.|$|E
60|$|He {{raised his}} eyes and looked at her. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> there was {{something}} almost satanic in the smile which alone disturbed the serenity of his face.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{husband that}} {{a ton of}} chains fell from his limbs. He did not say a word; he was happy beyond the power of speech.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never," [...] she said, with a shudder. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{then that}} {{marriage}} was so fearful {{a thing that}} certainly she could never venture upon it again.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as she {{recalled}} their talk {{that there was}} something lovable about Richard, good in their attempted friendship, and strangely piteous in the way they had parted.|$|R
