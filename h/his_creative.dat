5|$|Lutosławski's {{formidable}} technical developments {{grew out}} of <b>his</b> <b>creative</b> imperative; that he left a lasting body of major compositions {{is a testament to}} his resolution of purpose {{in the face of the}} anti-formalist authorities under which he formulated his methods.|$|E

5|$|Universal was {{initially}} reluctant on giving a potentially lucrative action film to a filmmaker {{who had never}} made an English-language film, but Platt convinced the studio that he could “create an environment that would allow Timur to be himself as a filmmaker and exercise <b>his</b> <b>creative</b> muscles”.|$|E
5|$|Cartier {{continued}} to direct television dramas during the 1960s, although after Barry {{stepped down as}} Head of Drama in 1961, he lost much of <b>his</b> <b>creative</b> independence. Barry's successor, Sydney Newman, abolished the BBC's traditional producer-director role and split the responsibilities into separate posts, leaving directors such as Cartier with less control over their productions. Cartier also found himself assigned to direct episodes of regular drama series, as such as Maigret and Z-Cars.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of Amir's writings were published in Poedjangga Baroe, although some earlier ones were published in Timboel and Pandji Poestaka. None of <b>his</b> <b>creative</b> works are dated, {{and there is no}} consensus regarding when individual poems were written. However, there is a consensus that the works included in Nyanyi Sunyi were written after those included in Buah Rindu, despite the latter being published last. Johns writes that the poems in the collections appear to be arranged in chronological order; he points to the various degrees of maturity Amir showed as his writing developed.|$|E

50|$|Among the Berger architects, Robert Boughey {{maintained}} a consistency in architectural vocabulary, technical excellence and aesthetics in <b>his</b> <b>creatives,</b> concrete frame structures and its honest expression through ribbon window, non-load-bearing partition walls and cantilevered veranda as {{are some examples}} that characterized Boughey’s design. An inter-marriage of spatial and structural innovation culminated in his outstanding designs of the Kamalapur railway station, which is remarkable for the open petal shaped canopy unifying a number of otherwise disjointed buildings an innovative expression through architectural forms.|$|R
5|$|Through his {{critical}} writings, published {{under his}} own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards {{the end of his}} life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of <b>his</b> <b>creative</b> inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand.|$|E
5|$|According to Geisel's biographers Judith and Neil Morgan, Horton Hatches the Egg {{was born}} in 1940, the day after New Year's, {{when he took a}} break from drawing in his Park Avenue {{apartment}} and went for a walk. When he returned, he noticed that he had left a window open in his studio and that the wind had blown one sketch on transparent paper on top of another, making it look like an elephant was sitting in a tree. This account was based on interviews with Geisel, who had told similar stories about the book's creation to reporters asking about <b>his</b> <b>creative</b> process since as early as 1957. The story had changed with each telling but always involved the fortuitous juxtaposition of drawings of an elephant and a tree.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s Notosusanto wrote extensively, {{focusing}} on essays but also writing poems and, later, short stories; {{the last of}} <b>his</b> <b>creative</b> works were written around 1956. He published four short story anthologies between 1958 and 1963. The first, Hudjan Kepagian (Morning Rain), consisted of six short stories. It dealt with the struggle against the Dutch colonists during the revolution. His second anthology, Tiga Kota (Three Cities), was published the following year and followed events in three cities: Rembang, Yogyakarta, and Jakarta. The others, and his numerous stories which were published outside of anthologies, mostly dealt with {{the war and the}} positive effects of revolution.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, Petersen Rock Garden {{was named}} one of Oregon's Most Endangered Places by the Historic Preservation League of Oregon (now known as Restore Oregon). In 2012, {{accidental}} damage {{to one of the}} stone bridges by a contractor catalyzed an effort to document the garden using laser scanning and other technologies. The garden was closed temporarily in 2013 to undergo repair and review for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Petersen has been praised for <b>his</b> <b>creative</b> work, and the garden has received a positive reception for its uniqueness and local significance. Listing on the National Register was achieved on October 30, 2013.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1860s, {{a more liberal}} {{political}} climate in Bohemia encouraged Smetana to return permanently to Prague. He threw himself into the musical life of the city, primarily {{as a champion of}} the new genre of Czech opera. In 1866 his first two operas, The Brandenburgers in Bohemia and The Bartered Bride, were premiered at Prague's new Provisional Theatre, the latter achieving great popularity. In that same year, Smetana became the theatre's principal conductor, but the years of his conductorship were marked by controversy. Factions within the city's musical establishment considered his identification with the progressive ideas of Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner inimical {{to the development of a}} distinctively Czech opera style. This opposition interfered with <b>his</b> <b>creative</b> work, and might have hastened a decline in health that precipitated his resignation from the theatre in 1874.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s Tolkien was {{pursuing}} an academic career at Oxford as Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon, with a fellowship at Pembroke College. Several of his poems {{had been published}} in magazines and small collections, including Goblin Feet and , a reworking of the nursery rhyme Hey Diddle Diddle. <b>His</b> <b>creative</b> endeavours at this time also included letters from Father Christmas to his children—illustrated manuscripts that featured warring gnomes and goblins, and a helpful polar bear—alongside the creation of elven languages and an attendant mythology, {{which he had been}} creating since 1917. These works all saw posthumous publication.|$|E

5|$|Like {{all of the}} hospital's doctors, House is {{required}} to treat patients in the facility's walk-in clinic. His grudging fulfillment of this duty, or <b>his</b> <b>creative</b> methods of avoiding it, constitute a recurring subplot, which often serves as the series' comic relief. During clinic duty, House confounds patients with unwelcome observations into their personal lives, eccentric prescriptions, and unorthodox treatments. However, after seeming to be inattentive to their complaints, he regularly impresses them with rapid and accurate diagnoses. Analogies {{with some of the}} simple cases in the clinic occasionally inspire insights that help solve the team's case.|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn wrote symphonies, concerti, oratorios, piano {{music and}} chamber music. His best-known works include his Overture and {{incidental}} music for A Midsummer Night's Dream, the Italian Symphony, the Scottish Symphony, the overture The Hebrides, his mature Violin Concerto, and his String Octet. His Songs Without Words are {{his most famous}} solo piano compositions. After {{a long period of}} relative denigration due to changing musical tastes and antisemitism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, <b>his</b> <b>creative</b> originality has now been recognised and re-evaluated. He is now among the most popular composers of the Romantic era.|$|E
5|$|Raised in Cabra, Dublin, {{he began}} his career at Home Farm, before {{spending}} two years with Glentoran from 1965 to 1967.
