30|$|A {{practical}} {{concern is}} that the protection configuration itself (the decision variables S) impacts its possible failure modes, and therefore the possible elements of Q. Deciding S {{on the basis of a}} given set of failure pathways Q reverses this causality: it effectively makes the optimizer clairvoyant, letting it avoid those protection elements that fail in some scenario q ∈Q. For example, in the context of a <b>generation</b> <b>rejection</b> scheme (an SPS that disconnects generation in abnormal system conditions), each outcome o is characterized by a collection of generators that successfully disconnect. Without further restrictions the partial security constraints h_Q would simply result in the use of generators that will not be impacted by the failures. To rectify this issue, we introduce the constraint S∈(Q) that ensures that the valid choices of protection configuration are those that are actually affected by the scenarios in Q.|$|E

Very fast automatic rejection algorithms were developed recently which allow to generate random variates from large classes of unimodal distributions. They require the choice of several design points which decompose the domain of the distribution into small sub-intervals. The optimal choice of these points is an important but unsolved problem. So we present an approach that allows to characterize optimal design points in the asymptotic case (when their number tends to infinity) under mild regularity conditions. We describe a short algorithm to calculate these asymptotically optimal points in practice.

The system operator configures the SPS by pre-selecting generators from Buses 18, 21, 22 and 23 to trip in response to the detection of one of the three triggering contingencies. It is assumed that SPS-connected generators are must-run units and do not provide reserve services. To simplify the problem representation and focus on relevant details, we do not distinguish between frequency response services and operating reserves, instead referring to both as reserves.|$|E

For each study, 1000 cases were generated for which the transient stability limits were cal-culated using a modified shell of B. C. Hydro’s on-line transient stability program. The shell which was developed for this project uses PTI’s PSSE simulation program and the Second Kick method. The results obtained showed that BC Hydro’s existing determin-istic criteria are very conservative with a probability of instability of smaller than 0. 2 %.

The basic approach is due to Minh [13] who suggested a special sampling method for the gamma distribution.

This is carried out via uniform hat functions combined with minorizing rectangles for immediate acceptance of one transformed uniform deviate.

30|$|The {{utilization}} {{levels of}} the transmission network can be enhanced {{by the use of}} automated protection schemes that rapidly respond to disturbances. However, such corrective systems may suffer from malfunctions that have the potential to exacerbate the impact of the disturbance. This paper addresses the challenge of jointly optimizing the dispatch of generators and protection settings in this context. This requires a holistic assessment of the cyber (protection logic) and physical (network) systems, considering the failures in each part and their interplay. Special protection schemes are used as a prototypical example of such a system. An iterative optimization method is proposed that relies on power system response simulations in order to perform detailed impact assessments and compare candidate solutions. The candidate solutions are generated {{on the basis of a}} security-constrained dispatch that also secures the system against a set of cyber failure modes. A case study is developed for a <b>generation</b> <b>rejection</b> scheme on the IEEE reliability test system (RTS): candidate solutions are produced based on a mixed integer linear programming optimisation model, and loss-of-load costs are computed using a basic cascading outage algorithm. It is shown that the partial security approach is able to identify solutions that provide a good balance of operational costs and loss-of-load risks, both in a fixed dispatch and variable dispatch context.|$|E
40|$|Power {{systems have}} {{undergone}} major changes {{the past few}} decades, leading {{to an increase in}} the frequency of occurrence and severity of blackouts. Intentional controlled islanding constitutes the final resort to rescue the system from a blackout by separating the network into islands in a controlled manner. Various post-separation control action such as <b>generation</b> <b>rejection</b> and load shedding have to be considered in order to restore the active power balance in the created islands. The transient stability of the constructed islands can be enhanced by identifying and grouping together the coherent generators of the power system. This can be achieved by representing the electrical network as an undirected graph and performing constrained graph partitioning with respect to the generator nodes. If the demand is higher than the active power produced, the frequency of the formed island starts declining. To deal with this problem and keep the frequency within acceptable limits, it often becomes necessary to curtail a proportion of the load. An advanced underfrequency load shedding scheme can dynamically adjust the shedding steps based on accurate power deficiency estimation and thus minimize the total load shed. In this thesis, the coherent generator groups are identified for several power systems. Then constrained graph partitioning is used to split these networks into islands, while forcing the coherent generators to remain in the same island. For this step, three different algorithms performing constrained clustering are implemented in Matlab and compared for two different study cases. Moreover, an advanced underfrequency load shedding scheme is applied on various constructed islands by utilizing PowerFactory and Python. Its objective is to minimize the load shedding amount, while keeping the frequency within the predefined limits. The amount of load that needs to be curtailed is estimated based on the frequency gradient of the generators in the island with an excess in power demand. Intelligent Electrical Power Grid...|$|E

40|$|The {{reliability}} of protection systems {{has emerged as}} an important topic because protection failures have critical influence on the {{reliability of}} power systems. The goal {{of this research is}} to develop novel approaches for modeling and analysis of the impact of protection system failures on power system reliability. It is shown that repairable and non-repairable assumptions make a remarkable difference in reliability modeling. A typical all-digital protection system architecture is modeled and numerically analyzed. If an all-digital protection system is indeed repairable but is modeled in a non-repairable manner for analysis, the calculated values of reliability indices could be grossly pessimistic. The smart grid is emerging with the penetration of information-age technologies and the development of the Special Protection System (SPS) will be greatly influenced. A conceptual all-digital SPS architecture is proposed for the future smart grid. Calculation of important reliability indices by the network reduction method and the Markov modeling method is illustrated in detail. Two different Markov models are proposed for reliability evaluation of the 2 -out-of- 3 voting gates structure in a <b>generation</b> <b>rejection</b> scheme. If the model with consideration of both detectable and undetectable logic gate failures is used as a benchmark, the simple model which only considers detectable failures will significantly overestimate the reliability of the 2 -out-of- 3 voting gates structure. The two types of protection failures, undesired-tripping mode and fail-to-operate mode are discussed. A complete Markov model for current-carrying components is established and its simplified form is then derived. The simplified model can appropriately describe the overall reliability situation of individual components under the circumstances of complex interactions between components due to protection failures. New concepts of the self-down state and the induced-down state are introduced and utilized to build up the composite unit model. Finally, a two-layer Markov model for power systems with protection failures is proposed. It can quantify the impact of protection failures on power system reliability. Using the developed methodology, we can see that the assumption of perfectly reliable protection can introduce errors in reliability evaluation of power systems...|$|E

40|$|While {{monoclonal}} antibodies show {{promise for}} use in the treatment of a variety of disease states, including cancer, autoimmune disease, and allograft <b>rejection,</b> <b>generation</b> of anti-antibody responses still remains a problem. For example, 50 % of the patients who receive OKT 3 produce blocking antibodies that interfere with its binding to T cells, thus decreasing the therapeutic effect (51). HAMA responses have also interfered with tumor imaging (39, 40) and radioimmunotherapy (56). The generation of an anti-antibody response is dependent on many factors. These include the dose of antibody, the number of injections of antibody, the immunogenicity of the antibody, the form of the antibody, and the immunocompetence of the recipient. Predictably, both the number of injections of antibody and the dosage are influential in the generation of an anti-antibody response. It is apparent that human antibodies, chimeric antibodies, and mouse Fab fragments are much less likely to induce anti-antibody responses than intact mouse monoclonal antibodies or mouse F(ab') 2 fragments when one injection is administered. Injections of human or chimeric antibodies appears to reduce immunogenicity, but the probability that anti-antibody responses can still be induced on multiple injections must be considered and appropriately evaluated. Several areas demand extensive investigation to enhance the clinical utility of monoclonal antibodies. First, results of thorough clinical trials with human or chimeric antibodies need to be evaluated for the induction of anti-antibodies after multiple injections of antibodies. Second, less immunogenic forms of antibodies (Fab, Fv) need to be studied for their clinical efficacies and for their abilities to induce anti-antibody responses...|$|R
