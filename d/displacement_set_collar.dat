40|$|This paper describe-s a teehnique {{to locate}} and {{characterize}} loose joints in a truss structure which are modeled as gaps in the members. The procedure involves prestressing the structure to first eliminate the gaps and then unloading the structure and monitoring a <b>set</b> of <b>displacements.</b> By comparing the calculated <b>displacements</b> to the <b>set</b> of known <b>displacements,</b> the gap lo&tion is identified, The loading and unloading is accomplished using a set of actuators whose locations are arbitrary. The sizes of the gaps are determined by monitoring the gap member length changes using the appropriate linear forcedisplacement relationship for the load level.

The time evolution of the damping torque contributions, due to shear at comb fingers and to drag over the surfaces of the micromirror plate, are computed.

In this essay, we examine the history of serial {{forced displacement}} in American cities due to federal, state, and local government policies.

50|$|<b>Set</b> screw <b>collars</b> {{are best}} used when the {{material}} of the shaft is softer than the set screw.

We show that h has a canonical pair of fixed {{points on the}} boundary and that it acts trivially on the boundary {{if and only if}} it is virtually central. The key tool that we use to study the action of h on ∂ X is the notion of a K-displacement set of h, which generalises the classical minimal <b>displacement</b> <b>set</b> of h.

40|$|This work {{deals in}} {{particular}} with variable displacement swashplate axial piston pumps which play a relevant role in feeding adjustable power for hydraulic mobile systems. In these machines the displacement changes with the inclination of the swashplate and to ensure a stable <b>displacement</b> <b>setting</b> is necessary to analyze the moments acting on the swashplate: the relevant contributions to this moment are due to the forces exerted by the pistons on the swashplate through the slipper bearings, which mainly depend on operating conditions, valve plate geometry, pistons angular positions, piston-slipper assembly inertia, viscous friction and on {{the force of the}} variable displacement actuator. The resistant moment is never equal to zero when speaking of actual machine and rises with delivery pressure up to consistent values which compromise the operation of the variable displacement mechanism. In the case of the machine studied the variable displacement mechanism is manually operated by the user, who has found significant difficulties in the <b>displacement</b> <b>setting</b> in some operating conditions. A lumped parameter model of the machine has been created which allows to determine the pressure transients within the pistons, taking into account the actual geometry of the valve plate and allowing to compute instantaneous and average moments acting on the swashplate. Comparison between the numerical average moment acting on the swashplate and experimental measurements on the machine has been done. At this point the influence of operating and design parameters has been analyzed and in particular {{it was found that the}} valve plate design together with the timing of the high and low pressure flow passages strongly influence the resistant moment arising on the swashplate. In particular, few modifications on the flow areas can lead to significant reduction of the resistant moment without compromising the machine operation...|$|R

40|$|Based on the Lie-group-algebraic {{properties}} of the <b>displacement</b> <b>set,</b> the 3 -dof generators of planar gliding motion (G) are introduced. Two serial generators of 3 -dof planar gliding produce a 5 -dof motion including 3 translations and 2 rotations (3 T- 2 R) as it is established using the composition product of two Lie subgroups of G-motion. All possible 3 T- 2 R 5 -dof limbs generating double-planar (G-G) kinematic bonds are comprehensively enumerated. There are a total of 21 mechanical generators of G-G motion with distinct architectures. The parallel setting of three 5 -dof G-G limb make up a translational parallel manipulator (TPM), which produces a motion subset of spatial translations. Moreover, related families of TPMs are also deducted using the commutation of factors in any products of spatial translations and rotations around an axis. By that way, some novel examples of 3 -dof TPM including doubly planar kinematic chains are synthesized systematically...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we present}} a {{graph-based}} concurrent brain tumor segmentation and atlas to diseased patient registration framework. Both segmentation and registration problems are modeled using a unified pairwise discrete Markov Random Field model on a sparse grid superimposed to the image domain. Segmentation is addressed based on pattern classification techniques, while registration is performed by maximizing the similarity between volumes and is modular {{with respect to the}} matching criterion. The two problems are coupled by relaxing the registration term in the tumor area, corresponding to areas of high classification score and high dissimilarity between volumes. In order to overcome the main shortcomings of discrete approaches regarding appropriate sampling of the solution space as well as important memory requirements, content driven samplings of the discrete <b>displacement</b> <b>set</b> and the sparse grid are considered, based on the local segmentation and registration uncertainties recovered by the min marginal energies. State of the art results on a substantial low-grade glioma database demonstrate the potential of our method, while our proposed approach shows maintained performance and strongly reduced complexity of the model...|$|R
40|$|Combining planar and spherical 4 R chains generates {{three kinds}} of new discontinuously movable (DM) seven-link mechanisms. The {{mobility}} analysis is based on algebraic concepts of set theory. These mechanisms are called hybrid planar-spherical 7 R, hybrid spherical-spherical 7 R, and hybrid planar-planar 6 R 1 P DM mechanisms. Their discontinuous mobility is explained employing the Lie group algebraic properties of the <b>displacement</b> <b>set.</b> Moreover, the same given spatial arrangement of joints can be linked in two ways constituting two distinct chains, which have a quite different mobility. One chain has two global degrees of freedom (d. o. f.), which disobey the general Grubler-Kutzbach mobility criterion. The other chain exhibits a singular pose, which is a bifurcation towards two distinct working modes of mobility with one d. o. f. Then the set of relative motions between any two specific links is not manifold but consists of the union of displacement one-dimensional manifolds. In general, when two or more subgroups {{are involved in a}} closed-loop chain, the discontinuous mobility can happen by changing the order of the kinematic pair linking...|$|R

40|$|We {{determine}} the large scale {{geometry of the}} minimal <b>displacement</b> <b>set</b> of a hyperbolic isometry of a systolic complex. As a consequence, we describe the centraliser of such an isometry in a systolic group. Using these results, we construct a low-dimensional classifying space for the family of virtually cyclic subgroups of a group acting properly on a systolic complex. Its dimension coincides with the topological dimension of the complex if the latter is at least four. We show that graphical small cancellation complexes are classifying spaces for proper actions and that the groups acting on them properly admit three-dimensional classifying spaces with virtually cyclic stabilisers. This is achieved by constructing a systolic complex equivariantly homotopy equivalent to a graphical small cancellation complex. On the way we develop a systematic approach to graphical small cancellation complexes. Finally, we construct low-dimensional models for the family of virtually abelian subgroups for systolic, graphical small cancellation, and some CAT(0) groups.

40|$|Specific {{regions of}} the cell {{envelope}} associated with the flagellar basal complex of the gram-negative bacterium Aquaspirillum (Spirillum) serpens were identified by studying each of the envelope layers: outer membrane, mucopeptide, and plasma membrane. The outer membrane around the flagella insertion site was differentiated by concentric membrane rings and central perforations surrounded by a closely <b>set</b> <b>collar.</b> The perforations in both the outer membrane and the isolated mucopeptide layer were of a size accomodating the central rod of the basal complex but smaller than either the L or the P disks. The P disk of the complex may lie between the mucopeptide and the outer membrane. Electron microscopy of intact, spheroplasted, or autolyzed preparations did not adequately resolve {{the location of the}} inner pair of disks of the basal complex. Freeze-etching, however, revealed differentiation within the plasma membrane that appeared {{to be related to the}} basal complex. The convex fracture face showed depressions which are interpreted as impressions of a disk surrounded by a set of evenly spaced macromolecular studs and containing a central "plug" interpreted as the central rod. In thin sections, blebs, which appear to be associated with the flagellar apparatus, were seen on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane. Superimposing the dimensions of the flagellar basal complex and the spacings of the cell envelope layers and using the position of the L disk within the outer membrane for reference, showed that the S disk might be within and the M disk beneath the plasma membrane. A tentative model was developed for comparison with that based on the structure of the Escherichia coli basal complex...|$|R
