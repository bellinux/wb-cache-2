40|$|Charity, like governments, serves public purposes. Charities {{have enjoyed}} the favour {{of the law}} since the Middle Ages because they are {{as much a part}} of the social fabric as any public institution. The law of charity has always had a public benefit test. • Unlike governments, {{charities}} do not raise funds by taxation but through donations and their own investment or trading income. • But just as governments cannot be, and are not, taxed (which would be self-contradictory), so charities, as public-serving bodies, should not be either. Unlike commercial companies, charities do not exist to pay dividends to private owners but to serve the public benefit. Their donations, income and funds are reserved for public benefit. Any comparison for a “level playing field ” in tax terms has to be with government itself. • Since charities do not tax, and must rely on voluntary donations, the tax system should free these funds from taxation by allowing deductibility and exemption to charities on a consistent basis. This is largely done in the USA, NZ, Denmark and the UK. • The Federal Government has commendably broadened deductibility for philanthropic gifts of property and has encouraged employers to offer payroll deduction for <b>deductible</b> <b>gifts...</b>|$|R

40|$|Employees' {{benefits}} from the income taxes point of view Employee benefit {{can be defined as}} a certain advantage given to the employee by his employer on top of his salary.

Benefits can be provided either in monetary or non-monetary form. The form of the benefit is usually crucial for the determination of its tax treatment on both employer's and employee's side. On the employee's side it has to be determined whether the benefit is taxable or tax exempt. On the employer's side it has to be determined whether the relating costs are tax deductible or not. The Income Taxes Act states explicitly that certain non-monetary benefits are tax non- <b>deductible</b> (e. g. <b>gifts,</b> expenses in the form of possibility to use cultural, leisure, medical, educational or sports facilities). In other cases the tax deductibility may be limited (e. g. contributions to alimentation provided by third parties including meal vouchers).
