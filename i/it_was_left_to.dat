5|$|Although {{credited}} {{with the development of}} the modern breed, Honeywood concentrated on producing dogs for hunting and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> Thomas Johnson to refine the breeding to produce dogs that were both attractive and capable hunters. Two strains were developed: the rough- and smooth-coated varieties. The rough-coated beagle survived until the beginning of the 20th century, and there were even records of one making an appearance at a dog show as late as 1969, but this variety is now extinct, having probably been absorbed into the standard beagle bloodline.|$|E

5|$|The French and British ambassadors had set {{themselves}} up at Poros and invited Constantinople {{to send a}} diplomat there so as to pursue negotiations over the status of Greece. The Porte persisted in refusing to participate in conferences. Hence, the French suggested continuing military operations and extending them into Attica and Euboea. The British opposed this plan. Thus <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> the Greeks to drive out the Ottomans from these territories, {{with the understanding that}} the French army would only intervene if the Greeks found themselves in trouble.|$|E
5|$|Following several stages won by sprinters and {{breakaway}}s, {{the next}} {{test for the}} riders was the legendary Alto de El Angliru in Stage 13. The morning breakaway was afforded over eleven minutes, but it was dropped to nothing on the ascent {{of what has been}} called the most difficult climb in all of professional cycling. Astana and Caisse d'Epargne both had many support riders in the leading group going up the climb, and they alternately tried to set paces to protect either Contador or Alejandro Valverde while isolating the competition. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> Leipheimer to pace Contador to the conclusion as the climb reached its hardest part, 7 kilometers from the finish. Contador indeed {{went on to win the}} stage, and took the race lead as well. Contador added another stage win the next day when only he and Leipheimer could respond to the repeated attacks of Ezequiel Mosquera, and Contador won the sprint.|$|E
5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of war in 1939 Coastal Command had forces of ten Avro Anson, including four auxiliaries, two Vickers Vildebeest, two Short Sunderland, three Saro London and one Supermarine Stranraer squadrons. The Vildebeest and London were all obsolescent. The Ansons made up half of this force, but with insufficient range to undertake deep ocean reconnaissance <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> the flying-boat squadrons, of which four out of six had obsolescent machines. This left three squadrons with suitable aircraft, the Lockheed Hudson and Sunderland that could operate effectively. Anson engines were in limited supply in 1939. Moreover, the Sunderland and Hudson airframes were also limited, the later being delivered {{at a rate of}} just two per month. To fill the gap in production capacity, the Air Ministry dispatched several missions to the United States to buy more Hudson airframes.|$|E

5|$|Shepard pursues Saren {{through the}} Conduit, {{arriving}} at the Citadel as it comes under attack by Sovereign and geth forces. Confronting Saren, Shepard can kill him or convince him to rebel, which results in Saren committing suicide. As a human Systems Alliance fleet masses to counterattack, Shepard must either save the Council and risk heavy casualties or abandon them to pursue Sovereign. Sovereign then reanimates Saren's corpse to attack Shepard, while simultaneously fighting off the Alliance. Eventually, humanity prevails, and Saren's corpse is destroyed while Sovereign is dispatched by the Normandy. Humanity will then join the Council, either as a member if it was saved or as its new leader if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> perish. Regardless, Shepard nominates either Anderson or Udina to this new leadership position before {{turning away from the}} proceedings, vowing to end the Reaper threat.|$|E
5|$|The Brioni Agreement {{isolated}} Marković {{who tried}} to preserve the federation, but was ignored by van den Broek who appeared not to comprehend issues presented before him, and the EC delegation tacitly encouraged the dissolution of Yugoslavia. The agreement diminished the authority of part of the JNA's leadership who fought {{for the preservation of}} the Yugoslav federation. The agreement was also unfavourable for Croatia because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> defend against the JNA and Serb forces. By effectively removing Slovenia from influence of the federal authorities, especially the JNA, the agreement fulfilled one of the Serbian nationalists' goals, allowing the redrawing of international borders. Sabrina Ramet noted that Kučan and Milošević reached an agreement in January 1991 in which Milošević gave his assurances that Slovenia's independence bid would not be opposed by Serbia. In return, Kučan expressed his understanding for Milošević's interest to create a Greater Serbia.|$|E
5|$|The tour opener was {{followed}} by a game against Leicestershire; Miller was promoted to No. 3. At the fall of the first wicket, the crowd surged towards the players' gate, expecting Bradman to enter in his customary batting position. Miller emerged instead, and scored an unbeaten 202 in five and a half hours, although he was dropped three times. He featured in a 111-run second wicket partnership with Sid Barnes, before putting on 159 with Bradman for the third wicket. After a late-order collapse, in which no other batsman passed 12, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> last man Bill Johnston to partner Miller from 180 onwards. The pair put on 37 for the tenth wicket before Johnston was out for 12, allowing Miller to complete a double century. One of his sixes concussed a spectator. After his long innings, Miller did not bowl in the first innings, but was used late in the second innings and took 2/10. Australia completed another innings triumph.|$|E

5|$|De l'Orme's {{original}} {{plans have}} not survived. Jacques Androuet du Cerceau, however, has left us {{a set of}} plans for the Tuileries. One engraving shows a grandiose palace, with three courts and two oval halls. This design is atypical of de l'Orme's style and so {{is likely to have}} been du Cerceau's own proposal or his son Baptiste's. It recalls the houses with tall pavilions and multiple courtyards that du Cerceau often drew in the 1560s and 1570s. Architectural historian David Thomson suggests that the oval halls within du Cerceau's courtyards were Catherine de' Medici's idea. She may have planned to use them for her famously lavish balls and entertainments. Du Cerceau's drawings reveal that, before he published them in 1576, Catherine decided to join the Louvre to the Tuileries by a gallery running west along the north bank of the Seine. Only the ground floor of the first section, the Petite Galerie, was completed in her lifetime. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> Henry IV, who ruled from 1589 to 1610, to add the second floor and the Grande Galerie that finally linked the two palaces.|$|E
5|$|In England's reply, captain Alastair Cook {{played in}} a fashion {{reminiscent}} of the man he had replaced for the tour, Strauss, as he played an accumulatory innings to score 64. Kieswetter, who had been brought into the team to provide firepower {{at the start of}} the innings was outscored by Cook 4 to 1, and was nearly dismissed twice in his first over, offering an edge to wicket-keeper Mushfiqur Rahim, and two balls later he was caught in front, but umpire Rod Tucker ruled that he was not out. Kieswetter was dismissed in the 13th over for 19, completely missing a drive; presenting Mushfiqur with an easy stumping. An over later, Kevin Pietersen fell for just one run, leaving England on 74/2. Cook and new man Collingwood put on 22 runs before the opener was adjudged leg before wicket (LBW) though replays indicated that the ball was missing the stumps on the leg side. Collingwood then anchored the chase with Eoin Morgan, the pair adding 88 runs to the score. After the dismissal of Morgan on 33, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> Prior to join Collingwood to add the required runs, and England won with four overs to spare.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{this left}} open the {{question}} of where to locate the capital. Initially the Bombala district in the far south of NSW was proposed, to which southern Monaro, (which incorporated Bombala), Orange and Yass were soon added. The NSW Premier, John See, offered to provide any of the three recommended sites as a future capital territory. Edmund Barton, the first Prime Minister of the new Federal Government, added another four sites to this list: Albury, Tamworth, Armidale and Tumut, and members of the new government toured the various sites in 1902. The tour proved inconclusive, and upon their return the members decided to refer the problem to a Royal Commission, with the Minister for Home Affairs, William Lyne, pushing for Tumut or Albury as he preferred a site in his electorate. Subsequently, the Commission presented its report to Parliament in 1903, recommending the sites of Albury, Tumut and Orange, in that order. However, there continued to be problems, as the House of Representatives backed the Tumut option, while the Senate preferred the town of Bombala. As a result of this disagreement the bill lapsed, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> the second Parliament to choose a location for the capital.|$|E

5|$|While Keats had {{remained}} with his prize Saumarez {{had led the}} remainder of the squadron forward, although Audacious had been left far behind the rest of the British force. The French and Spanish ships had scattered as Superb attacked the rearguard and during the night each made their way separately to the rendezvous off Cadiz harbour. As dawn broke at 04:00 on 13 July, lookouts on the leading British ship of the line Venerable under Captain Samuel Hood spotted the French ship Formidable, under the command of Captain Amable Troude in the absence of Linois, to the north. Formidable was trailing the rest of the squadron, close to the shore in Conil Bay to the south of Cadiz and north of Cape Trafalgar. The wind was light and coming from the land and so Caesar and Spencer, the latter being a long way behind the others, were unable to approach the French ship and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> Venerable and Thames, both inshore and therefore better able {{to make use of the}} wind, to lead the attack. Formidable had only jury topmasts following the battle on 6 July, and so Hood was able to rapidly approach the French ship, coming under fire from Troude's stern guns at 05:15, Hood holding off from replying until 05:20 so as to not delay his progress. The light breeze was at that point in Hood's favour, and Venerable was able to come close alongside Formidable and open fire with a full broadside. Off Cadiz, the remnants of Moreno's squadron formed up with the intention of sailing to Formidables aid, but were struck by a calm and could only watch the battle to the south.|$|E
