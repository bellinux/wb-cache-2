5|$|Humpback whales were hunted {{as early}} as the 18th century. By the 19th century, many nations (the United States in particular), were hunting the animal heavily in the Atlantic Ocean and to a lesser <b>extent</b> <b>in</b> the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The late-19th-century {{introduction}} of the explosive harpoon allowed whalers to accelerate their take. This, along with hunting in the Antarctic Ocean beginning in 1904, sharply reduced whale populations. During the 20th century, over 200,000 humpbacks were taken, reducing the global population by over 90%. North Atlantic populations dropped to as low as 700 individuals.|$|E

5|$|Since 1900, {{agriculture}} in the developed nations, {{and to a lesser}} <b>extent</b> <b>in</b> the developing world, has seen large rises in productivity as human labour has been replaced by mechanization, and assisted by synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and selective breeding. The Haber-Bosch process allowed the synthesis of ammonium nitrate fertilizer on an industrial scale, greatly increasing crop yields. Modern agriculture has raised social, political, and environmental issues including water pollution, biofuels, genetically modified organisms, tariffs and farm subsidies. In response, organic farming developed in the twentieth century {{as an alternative to the}} use of synthetic pesticides.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{kauri gum}} {{was found to}} mix more easily with linseed oil, at lower temperatures, than other resins, by the 1890s, 70 percent of all oil {{varnishes}} made in England used kauri gum. It was used to a limited <b>extent</b> <b>in</b> paints during the late 19th century, and from 1910 was used extensively {{in the manufacture of}} linoleum. From the 1930s, the market for gum dropped as synthetic alternatives were found, but there remained niche uses for the gum in jewellery and specialist high-grade varnish for violins.|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} are reported concerning {{the perception of}} ground extent to discover whether prior reports of anisotropy between frontal <b>extents</b> and <b>extents</b> <b>in</b> depth were consistent across different measures (visual matching and pantomime walking) and test environments (outdoor environments and virtual environments). In Experiment 1 {{it was found that}} depth extents of up to 7 m are indeed perceptually compressed relative to frontal <b>extents</b> <b>in</b> an outdoor environment, and that perceptual matching provided more precise estimates than did pantomime walking. In Experiment 2, similar anisotropies were found using similar tasks in a similar (but virtual) environment. In both experiments pantomime walking measures seemed to additionally compress the range of responses. Experiment 3 supported the hypothesis that range compression in walking measures of perceived distance might be due to proactive interference (memory contamination). It is concluded that walking measures are calibrated for perceived egocentric distance, but that pantomime walking measures may suffer range compression. Depth extents along the ground are perceptually compressed relative to frontal ground <b>extents</b> <b>in</b> a manner consistent with the angular scale expansion hypothesis.

40|$|A vibration-based damage {{identification}} method, based {{on changes in}} modal strain energies before and after occurrence of damage, is presented for a composite sandwich beam.
