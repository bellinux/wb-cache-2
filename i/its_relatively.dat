5|$|Also {{aiding the}} B-1's {{survivability}} is <b>its</b> <b>relatively</b> low radar cross-section (RCS). Although not technically a stealth aircraft {{in a comprehensive}} sense, thanks to the aircraft's structure, serpentine intake paths and use of radar-absorbent material its RCS is about 1/50th of the similar sized B-52's RCS; this is about 26ft² or 2.4m², roughly equivalent to the RCS of a small fighter aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Ammonia was {{tentatively}} detected on Mars by the Mars Express satellite, {{but with}} <b>its</b> <b>relatively</b> short lifetime, {{it is not}} clear what produced it. Ammonia is not stable in the Martian atmosphere and breaks down after a few hours. One possible source is volcanic activity.|$|E
5|$|Darkwatch was {{met with}} a {{generally}} positive critical reception, acclaimed in particular for <b>its</b> <b>relatively</b> unique Weird West setting and artistic merits.

5|$|The creek whaler {{is a minor}} bycatch of inshore gillnet {{fisheries}} {{operating in}} northern Australia; the meat is sold for human consumption. Given <b>its</b> <b>relatively</b> high reproductive rate, its population appears capable of withstanding present levels of fishing.

5|$|To {{have reached}} its {{enormous}} size within <b>its</b> <b>relatively</b> short (geologically speaking) 600,000 to 1,000,000 years of life, Mauna Loa would logically {{have had to}} have grown extremely rapidly through its developmental history, and extensive charcoal-based radiocarbon dating (perhaps the most extensive such prehistorical eruptive dating on Earth) has amassed a record of almost two hundred reliably dated extant flows confirming this hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{chemical}} similarity, lithium typically {{does not}} occur together with sodium or potassium due to its smaller size. Due to <b>its</b> <b>relatively</b> low reactivity, {{it can be found}} in seawater in large amounts; it is estimated that seawater is approximately 0.14 to 0.25 parts per million (ppm) or 25 micromolar. Its diagonal relationship with magnesium often allows it to replace magnesium in ferromagnesium minerals, where its crustal concentration is about 18ppm, comparable to that of gallium and niobium. Commercially, the most important lithium mineral is spodumene, which occurs in large deposits worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{relative}} brightness (it {{is about a}} fifth as bright as Pluto), Makemake was not discovered until after many much fainter Kuiper belt objects. Most searches for minor planets are conducted relatively close to the ecliptic (the region of the sky that the Sun, Moon and planets appear to lie in, as seen from Earth), due to the greater likelihood of finding objects there. It probably escaped detection during the earlier surveys due to <b>its</b> <b>relatively</b> high orbital inclination, {{and the fact that}} it was at its farthest distance from the ecliptic at the time of its discovery, in the northern constellation of Coma Berenices.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{more than}} three centuries of {{occasional}} human impact on Caroline, it {{is considered to be}} one of very few remaining near-pristine tropical islands, and has been rated {{as one of the most}} unspoiled Pacific atolls. <b>Its</b> <b>relatively</b> undisturbed state has led to Caroline being considered for designation as a World Heritage Site and as a Biosphere Reserve. Ecological surveys documenting the island's flora and fauna have been made intermittently through the later 20th century: Caroline was visited in 1965 by the Pacific Ocean Biological Survey Program, in 1974 by the Line Island Expedition, and in 1988 and 1991 by the United Nations Environment Programme Wildlife Conservation Unit.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{exterior}} devastation {{caused by the}} bow's descent and collision with the ocean floor, {{there are parts of}} the interior in reasonably good condition. The bow's slow flooding and <b>its</b> <b>relatively</b> smooth descent to the sea floor mitigated interior damage. The stairwell of the First-Class Grand Staircase between the Boat Deck and E Deck is an empty chasm within the wreck, providing a convenient point of access for ROVs. Dense rusticles hanging from the steel decking combined with the deep layers of silt that have accumulated in the interior make navigating the wreck disorienting.|$|E
5|$|Francium's {{ability to}} be synthesized, trapped, and cooled, along with <b>its</b> <b>relatively</b> simple atomic structure, has made it the subject of {{specialized}} spectroscopy experiments. These experiments have led to more specific information regarding energy levels and the coupling constants between subatomic particles. Studies on the light emitted by laser-trapped francium-210 ions have provided accurate data on transitions between atomic energy levels which are fairly similar to those predicted by quantum theory.|$|E

In addition, plans to place the headquarters of Galileo in Prague met with opposition over security concerns that the city would not be safe enough for such a sensitive agency.|$|E
5|$|Hull Creek is a second-order stream {{with some}} {{wetlands}} in its watershed. <b>Its</b> <b>relatively</b> narrow watershed occupies parts of Scott Township, Blakely, Archbald, and Dickson City.

In 2013, it received a habitat assessment score of 159 {{on a scale of}} 0 to 200. Macroinvertebrate taxa such as mayflies (Ephemeroptera), stoneflies (Plecoptera), and caddis flies (Trichoptera) inhabit the creek as well.|$|E
5|$|Interceptor {{aircraft}} with ever-improving performance {{remained the}} only effective anti-bomber weapons {{by the early}} 1950s, and even these were having problems {{keeping up with the}} latest designs; Soviet interceptors during the late 1950s could not intercept the high-altitude U-2 reconnaissance aircraft, in spite of <b>its</b> <b>relatively</b> low speeds. It was later discovered that flying faster also made radar detection much more difficult due to an effect known as the blip-to-scan ratio, and any reduction in tracking efficiency would further interfere with the operation and guidance of fighters.|$|E

To put this in perspective, this would make it larger than all but four of the asteroids, after 1 Ceres, 2 Pallas, 4 Vesta, and 10 Hygiea. In spite of <b>its</b> <b>relatively</b> large size, however, lightcurve studies suggest that Hi'iaka is not a gravitationally collapsed spheroid; they further suggest that Hi'iaka is not tidally locked and has a rotation period of about 9.8 hours.|$|E
5|$|Lead's per-particle {{abundance}} in the Solar System is 0.121 ppb (parts per billion). This figure is {{two and a}} half times higher than that of platinum, eight times more than mercury, and seventeen times more than gold. The amount of lead in the universe is slowly increasing as most heavier atoms (all of which are unstable) gradually decay to lead. The abundance of lead in the Solar System since its formation 4.5 billion years ago has increased by about 0.75%. The solar system abundances table shows that lead, despite <b>its</b> <b>relatively</b> high atomic number, is more prevalent than most other elements with atomic numbers greater than 40.|$|E

Mercury's very tenuous atmosphere consists of atoms blasted off its surface by the solar wind. <b>Its</b> <b>relatively</b> large iron core and thin mantle {{have not yet been}} adequately explained.
