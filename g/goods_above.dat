50|$|In many countries, customs {{procedures}} for arriving passengers at many international airports and some road crossings are separated into {{red and green}} channels. Passengers with goods to declare (carrying <b>goods</b> <b>above</b> the permitted customs limits and/or carrying prohibited items) go through the red channel. Passengers with nothing to declare (carrying goods within the permitted customs limits and not carrying prohibited items) go through the green channel. However, entry into a particular channel constitutes a legal declaration, if a passenger going through the green channel {{is found to be}} carrying <b>goods</b> <b>above</b> the customs limits or prohibited items, he or she may be prosecuted for making a false declaration to customs, by virtue of having gone through the green channel.

40|$|When {{government}} needs more revenue than {{is available from}} a pollution tax rate equal to marginal environmental damage, our intuition tells us to raise the tax on the clean <b>good</b> <b>above</b> zero and to raise the tax on the dirty <b>good</b> <b>above</b> that first-best Pigouvian rate. Yet new {{results suggest that the}} second-best pollution tax is below the Pigouvian rate. This note reconciles these views by pointing out that these new results use a labor tax to acquire additional revenue, and that the labor tax is equivalent to a uniform tax on both clean and dirty goods. Thus, depending on the normalization, the total tax on the dirty <b>good</b> can be <b>above</b> the Pigouvian rate. These recent results are meant to show that the difference between the tax on the dirty good and the tax on the clean good is less than the Pigouvian rate. Any one tax rate can be set to zero as a conceptual matter, but implementation of some taxes might be easier than others as a practical matter. ...|$|R

50|$|These {{possible}} {{changes in}} valuation {{enable us to}} understand already that what any particular product will trade for is delimited by what other products will trade for, quite independently of how much the buyer would like to pay, or how much the seller {{would like to get}} in return. Value {{should not be confused with}} price here, however, because products can be traded at prices above or below what they are worth (implying value-price deviations; this complicates the picture and is elaborated only in the third volume of Das Kapital). There are value-structures and price-structures. For simplicity's sake, Marx assumes initially that the money-price of a commodity will be equal to its value (ordinarily, price-value deviations would not be very great); but in Capital, Volume III it becomes clear that the sale of <b>goods</b> <b>above</b> or below their value has a crucial effect on profits.|$|E
30|$|However, {{when the}} {{consumer}} is skeptical or relationship-based, the zone of certification falls {{in the area where}} the certification standard is less than the producer’s ideal (below the diagonal). In this case, a producer in the zone of certification is not likely to increase the quality of the <b>good</b> <b>above</b> the quality that would have been chosen without certification. Therefore, the consumer’s skepticism about the certification standards leads to the self-fulfilling result of the certification regime doing little or nothing to increase the quality of the good produced.|$|R

50|$|HMRC {{have the}} legal right to stop and search any vehicle. As their main duty is to detect 'smuggled' goods (and other far more {{sinister}} imports), they can (and usually do) use their own common sense regarding unconcealed (i.e. openly-carried) <b>goods</b> <b>above</b> their 'limits', if they are happy that the goods are genuinely for personal consumption. Generally, suspicion will only be aroused if the goods start to look less like a 'personal' hoard, and more like a commercial operation. For example: importing more different brands of tobacco products than there are adult travellers in the vehicle arouses particular suspicion, as most smokers tend to remain loyal to one particular brand. However, there have been reported cases of more extreme treatment (especially where people have unnecessarily concealed extra goods in vehicle cavities, spare wheel wells etc.), with family cars and contents being confiscated on the spot and the travelers left stranded at Dover in the dead of night. This has led to legal challenges to the powers of HMRC, citing the heavy-handedness and inconsistency of some actions, and their dubious legality under European law.|$|E
50|$|The Mobile {{waterfront}} {{was subjected}} to a storm surge of 11.6 ft, which still stands as the second-highest in the state's history, {{just short of the}} record set in Gulf Shores by the 1906 Mississippi hurricane, and the highest ever recorded at Mobile. The tides severely flooded Mobile's business district up to four blocks inland, and it took until the late afternoon of July 6 for floodwaters to recede. Some streets were submerged to a depth of up to 10 ft, and many residents fled to the Battle House Hotel on relatively higher ground. Ultimately, waters still reached the hotel, flooding its lobby to a depth of just over 1 ft. In advance of the storm, most wholesale merchants stacked their <b>goods</b> <b>above</b> the high water mark of the 1906 hurricane, but this proved inadequate; tides locally ran nearly 2 ft higher than in 1906, ruining merchandise closest to the ground at a cost of around $500,000. Many miles of railroads were covered by floodwaters and debris, and the tidal action ravaged wharves. At a Mobile and Ohio Railroad cargo storage shed, approximately 11,000 bales of cotton were washed away.|$|E
50|$|The tourist {{destination}} is having positive impacts, if {{there have been}} improvements to the natural environment such as protection, national parks, or man-made infrastructure;waste-treatment plants.Tourism provides the economic stimulus to allow for diversification of employment and income potential, and develop resources within the community. Improvements in infrastructure and services can benefit both the locals and the tourists. Whereas, heritage tourism focus on the local history or historical event {{that occurred in the}} area, and tends to promote education. Positive impacts begin when there is an increase in job opportunities for locals as the tourism industry becomes more developed. There is also an increase in average income that spreads throughout the community when tourism is capitalized on. In addition, the local economy is stimulated and diversified, goods are manufactured more locally, and new markets open for local business owners to expand to. Unfortunately, these benefits are not universal or invulnerable. While more employment may be available, tourism-related jobs are often seasonal and low-paying for entrants into the job market. Prices are known to fluctuate throughout the year; they rise in the high tourism season to take advantage of more tourist dollars, but have the side effect of pricing <b>goods</b> <b>above</b> the economic reach of local residents, effectively starving them out of a place that was once their home.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a simple two-period model of public good provision within a federation. A national public good is provided to both {{states by the}} federal government, while a local public good is supplied by each state government. The federal government levies a proportional income tax, and in each period the state governments receive {{a share of the}} revenues collected equal to the amount needed to finance the first best provision of the local public good. In the first period the local governments can also use borrowing to finance the provision of the public good, but any debt contracted must be repaid in the second period. We show that when the states face a hard budget constraint, they do not find it optimal to increase the provision of the local public <b>good</b> <b>above</b> the first best level guaranteed by the federal grant. However, if the federal government cannot credibly commit not to bail-out the states, then the local governments may find it optimal to borrow in order to increase the provision of the public <b>good</b> <b>above</b> the first best in the first period. Furthermore, we show that the commitment problem is more likely to arise vis-á-vis states whose default results in a negative externality on the federation. Hence, those states are more likely to carry on budget deficits and benefit fro...|$|R
