5|$|No other metal is {{verified}} {{to be more}} naturally diamagnetic than bismuth. (Superdiamagnetism is {{a different}} physical phenomenon.) Of any metal, it {{has one of the}} lowest values of thermal conductivity (after manganese, and maybe neptunium and plutonium) and the highest Hall coefficient.

40|$|Effect of {{compositional}} wavelength (modulation) on residual stress, <b>electrical</b> <b>resistivities</b> {{and mechanical}} properties of Cu/Nb thin-film multilayers sputtered onto single-crystal Si substrates, was evaluated. <b>Electrical</b> <b>resistivities</b> were measured down to 4 K using a standard 4 -point probe. Differential specimen curvature {{was used to}} determine residual stress, and a microprobe was used to obtain hardness and elastic modulus. Profilometry, ion-beam analysis and TEM were used. Hardness of the Cu-Nb multilayers increased with decreasing compositional wavelength so that the layered structures had hardness values in excess of either constituent and the hardness predicted by the rule of mixtures. A peak in net residual compressive stress of the multilayers was observed at a compositional wavelength of 100 nm. No resistivity plateau was observed within the composition wavelength range studied...|$|R
5|$|Metals make {{relatively}} good conductors of heat, primarily because the delocalized electrons {{are free to}} transport thermal energy between atoms. However, unlike electrical conductivity, the thermal conductivity of a metal is nearly independent of temperature. This is expressed mathematically by the Wiedemann–Franz law, which states that the ratio of thermal conductivity to the electrical conductivity {{is proportional to the}} temperature. The thermal disorder in the metallic lattice increases the <b>electrical</b> <b>resistivity</b> of the material, producing a temperature dependence for electric current.|$|E
5|$|The {{melting point}} of lead—at 327.5°C (621.5°F)—is very low {{compared}} to most metals. Its boiling point of 1749°C (3180°F) is the lowest among the carbon group elements. The <b>electrical</b> <b>resistivity</b> of lead at 20°C is 192 nanoohm-meters, almost {{an order of magnitude}} higher than those of other industrial metals (copper at 15.43nΩ·m; gold 20.51nΩ·m; and aluminium at 24.15nΩ·m). Lead is a superconductor at temperatures lower than 7.19K; this is the highest critical temperature of all type-I superconductors and the third highest of the elemental superconductors.|$|E
5|$|About fifty {{grades of}} {{titanium}} and titanium alloys are designed and currently used, although {{only a couple}} of dozen are readily available commercially. The ASTM International recognizes 31 grades of titanium metal and alloys, of which Grades 1 through 4 are commercially pure (unalloyed). Those four vary in tensile strength as a function of oxygen content, with Grade 1 being the most ductile (lowest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0.18%), and Grade 4 the least ductile (highest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0.40%). The remaining grades are alloys, each designed for specific properties of ductility, strength, hardness, <b>electrical</b> <b>resistivity,</b> creep resistance, specific corrosion resistance, and combinations thereof.|$|E

40|$|Two reports discuss {{methods for}} {{evaluating}} the magnitude of electrostatic charging that occurs in spacecraft dielectric materials (in particular, polyimides) during prolonged exposure to radiation in outer space. The reports describe experiments on the <b>electrical</b> <b>resistivities</b> and charge-storage properties of polyimide specimens in a dark, evacuated environment, {{both before and after}} 5 -megarad exposures to rays from cobalt- 60. The experiments were designed to measure these properties not under standard conditions prescribed for testing dielectrics in air but, rather, under conditions approximating those in the intended spacecraft applications. The results of the experiments showed that the <b>electrical</b> <b>resistivities</b> of the insulations as determined under these conditions are greater, by a factor of roughly a thousand, than those determined under the standard conditions and that the gamma irradiation reduced resistivities marginally...|$|R

5|$|Because of its {{excellent}} thermal {{and chemical}} stability, boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used {{as parts of}} high-temperature equipment. h-BN can be included in ceramics, alloys, resins, plastics, rubbers, and other materials, giving them self-lubricating properties. Such materials are suitable for construction of e.g. bearings and in steelmaking. Plastics filled with BN have less thermal expansion as well as higher thermal conductivity and <b>electrical</b> <b>resistivity.</b> Due to its excellent dielectric and thermal properties, BN is used in electronics e.g. as a substrate for semiconductors, microwave-transparent windows and as a structural material for seals. It {{can also be used}} as dielectric in resistive random access memories.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with magnetic data, <b>electrical</b> <b>resistivity</b> of curium increases with temperature – about twice between 4 and 60 K – and then remains nearly constant up to room temperature. There {{is a significant}} increase in resistivity over time (about 10 µΩ·cm/h) due to self-damage of the crystal lattice by alpha radiation. This makes uncertain the absolute resistivity value for curium (about 125 µΩ·cm). The resistivity of curium {{is similar to that of}} gadolinium and of the actinides plutonium and neptunium, but is significantly higher than that of americium, uranium, polonium and thorium.|$|E
5|$|Actinides {{are typical}} metals. All {{of them are}} soft and have a silvery color (but tarnish in air), {{relatively}} high density and plasticity. Some {{of them can be}} cut with a knife. Their <b>electrical</b> <b>resistivity</b> varies between 15 and 150 µOhm·cm. The hardness of thorium {{is similar to that of}} soft steel, so heated pure thorium can be rolled in sheets and pulled into wire. Thorium is nearly half as dense as uranium and plutonium, but is harder than either of them. All actinides are radioactive, paramagnetic, and, with the exception of actinium, have several crystalline phases: plutonium has seven, and uranium, neptunium and californium three. The crystal structures of protactinium, uranium, neptunium and plutonium do not have clear analogs among the lanthanides and are more similar to those of the 3d-transition metals.|$|E

5|$|Tungsten {{exists in}} two major {{crystalline}} forms: α and β. The former has a {{body-centered cubic structure}} and is the more stable form. The structure of the β phase is called A15 cubic; it is metastable, but can coexist with the α phase at ambient conditions owing to non-equilibrium synthesis or stabilization by impurities. Contrary to the α phase which crystallizes in isometric grains, the β form exhibits a columnar habit. The α phase has {{one third of the}} <b>electrical</b> <b>resistivity</b> and a much lower superconducting transition temperature TC relative to the β phase: ca. 0.015 K vs. 1–4 K; mixing the two phases allows obtaining intermediate TC values. The TC value can also be raised by alloying tungsten with another metal (e.g. 7.9 K for W-Tc). Such tungsten alloys are sometimes used in low-temperature superconducting circuits.|$|E
5|$|Ytterbium {{has three}} allotropes labeled by the Greek letters alpha, beta and gamma; their {{transformation}} temperatures are −13°C and 795°C, although the exact transformation temperature {{depends on the}} pressure and stress. The beta allotrope (6.966 g/cm3) exists at room temperature, {{and it has a}} face-centered cubic crystal structure. The high-temperature gamma allotrope (6.57 g/cm3) has a body-centered cubic crystalline structure. The alpha allotrope (6.903 g/cm3) has a hexagonal crystalline structure and is stable at low temperatures. The beta allotrope has a metallic electrical conductivity at normal atmospheric pressure, but it becomes a semiconductor when exposed to a pressure of about 16,000 atmospheres (1.6GPa). Its <b>electrical</b> <b>resistivity</b> increases ten times upon compression to 39,000 atmospheres (3.9GPa), but then drops to about 10% of its room-temperature resistivity at about 40,000atm (4.0GPa).|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} other actinides, self-damage of the crystal lattice due to alpha-particle {{irradiation}} is intrinsic to americium. It is especially noticeable at low temperatures, where the mobility of the produced lattice defects is relatively low, by broadening of X-ray diffraction peaks. This effect makes somewhat uncertain the temperature of americium {{and some of its}} properties, such as <b>electrical</b> <b>resistivity.</b> So for americium-241, the resistivity at 4.2 K increases with time from about 2µOhm·cm to 10µOhm·cm after 40 hours, and saturates at about 16µOhm·cm after 140 hours. This effect is less pronounced at room temperature, due to annihilation of radiation defects; also heating to room temperature the sample which was kept for hours at low temperatures restores its resistivity. In fresh samples, the resistivity gradually increases with temperature from about 2 µOhm·cm at liquid helium to 69µOhm·cm at room temperature; this behavior {{is similar to that of}} neptunium, uranium, thorium and protactinium, but is different from plutonium and curium which show a rapid rise up to 60K followed by saturation. The room temperature value for americium is lower than that of neptunium, plutonium and curium, but higher than for uranium, thorium and protactinium.|$|E

The phase and stoichiometries {{of the resulting}} materials were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction and energy dispersive spectroscopy, while their high-temperature transport properties were investigated from 300 to 800 K. The Seebeck coefficients and <b>electrical</b> <b>resistivities</b> increased linearly with increasing temperature for the double-filled specimens. The Seebeck coefficients and <b>electrical</b> <b>resistivities</b> did not change {{very much for the}} As-substituted specimens. The thermal conductivity for all specimens decreased with increasing temperature up to 700 K, corresponding to the plateau in the Seebeck coefficient, and then increased again due to bipolar diffusion.

5|$|The first {{ionisation}} {{energy of}} hydrogen (1312.0 kJ/mol) {{is much higher}} than that of the alkali metals. As only one additional electron is required to fill in the outermost shell of the hydrogen atom, hydrogen often behaves like a halogen, forming the negative hydride ion, and is very occasionally considered to be a halogen on that basis. (The alkali metals can also form negative ions, known as alkalides, but these are little more than laboratory curiosities, being unstable.) An argument against this placement is that formation of hydride from hydrogen is endothermic, unlike the exothermic formation of halides from halogens. The radius of the H− anion also does not fit the trend of increasing size going down the halogens: indeed, H− is very diffuse because its single proton cannot easily control both electrons. It was expected for some time that liquid hydrogen would show metallic properties; while this has been shown to not be the case, under extremely high pressures, such as those found at the cores of Jupiter and Saturn, hydrogen does become metallic and behaves like an alkali metal; in this phase, it is known as metallic hydrogen. The <b>electrical</b> <b>resistivity</b> of liquid metallic hydrogen at 3000 K is approximately equal to that of liquid rubidium and caesium at 2000 K at the respective pressures when they undergo a nonmetal-to-metal transition.|$|E
25|$|Selection of a TIM {{is based}} on three parameters: the {{interface}} gap which the TIM must fill, the contact pressure, and the <b>electrical</b> <b>resistivity</b> of the TIM.

Archaeological features whose <b>electrical</b> <b>resistivity</b> contrasts with that of surrounding soils can be detected and mapped.
