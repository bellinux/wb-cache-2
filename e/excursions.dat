5|$|Motor buses {{appeared}} in the district from 1924, and passenger numbers dropped. Cheap fares and a steam railcar did not halt the decline, although {{in the last days}} of operation, five trains were run on Saturdays, three on Wednesdays and two on other weekdays. The last trains ran on 15 July 1933, with all passenger services suspended from Monday 17 July. In addition to timetabled services, <b>excursions</b> were run, with Epworth, the birthplace of John Wesley, the founder of Methodism being popular. The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway published a booklet entitled Epworth: What to see and how to get there to entice people to travel there from Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire. <b>Excursions</b> from the Isle of Axholme to Blackpool were popular, with over 600 passengers on such a trip in 1913, and 750 visiting the Great Yorkshire Show at Hull in 1922. <b>Excursions</b> to Blackpool continued to be run even after timetabled passenger services were withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|The {{line was}} used for {{occasional}} <b>excursions</b> by railway enthusiasts {{for a short period}} after official closure, using the electric locomotive and a brake van borrowed from British Railways. The exact date of the last run is not recorded; the last recorded use of the line was an excursion organised by the Norbury Transport and Model Railway Club on 4April 1959, but it is known that later <b>excursions</b> ran. In the early 1960s a railway society in Yorkshire proposed to buy the track as a preserved railway. However, as the psychiatric hospital was still open the request was not considered practical, and the track was lifted in the early 1960s. The fittings and locomotive were disposed of by H.Ripley and Sons of Hailsham.|$|E

The reliability of ultrasound measurement of longitudinal radial nerve <b>excursion</b> was moderate to high (intraclass correlation coefficient range =  0. 63 – 0. 86, standard {{error of measurement}} 0. 19 – 0. 48).
