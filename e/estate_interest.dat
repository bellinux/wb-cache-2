However, the implication of the Bruton case [...] "controversially confirms the existence in English Law of {{the phenomenon of the}} contractual or non-proprietary lease". It has been suggested by some commentators however, that Bruton was driven by policy as established in Street v Mountford, that individuals enjoying exclusive possession should be protected.

50|$|Archives of more {{exclusively}} <b>estate</b> <b>interest</b> are the Duke of Norfolk's Sheffield, Worksop, and Derbyshire estate archives (Arundel Castle manuscripts). The Dukes of Norfolk {{and their}} predecessors the Earls of Shrewsbury were lords of the manor of Sheffield (as the present Duke still is), of Worksop, and of Glossop and Glossopdale in Derbyshire. The manuscripts include detailed accounts and rentals (including the Shropshire estates) {{for the late}} Elizabethan period. The Sheffield archives are extensive, their main interest lying in the urban development of Sheffield in {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} centuries, including collieries and markets. There is a series of the Sheffield agents' letters and diaries in the nineteenth century. The Worksop records cover in particular the eighteenth century when Worksop was a residence of the dukes. The Glossop records also refer mainly to the nineteenth century when the town became a prosperous manufacturing district and there are records of several turnpike trusts of the Glossop area.|$|E

A full length oil portrait of Verney, {{in the style of}} the Spanish school, is also displayed at the <b>estate.</b> <b>Interest</b> in Verney carried over into the 20th century as part of the era's popular culture. He was referenced in Dashiell Hammett's 1930 detective novel The Maltese Falcon as one of the people who possessed the jeweled bird. The title character of the 1940 swashbuckler film The Sea Hawk, played by Errol Flynn, was inspired by the lives of both Verney and Sir Henry Mainwaring.

50|$|The {{shift in}} content of drive-ins was {{less of a}} problem than {{competition}} from home entertainment, from color television to VCRs and video rentals. This, along with the 1970s energy crisis led to a sharp decline of attendance as well to the widespread adoption of daylight saving time (which made the shows start an hour later), making it harder for drive-ins to operate successfully. Also, the 1980s real <b>estate</b> <b>interest</b> rate hikes made the large property areas increasingly expensive, and thus far too valuable for businesses such as drive-ins, which in many cases were summer-only. Drive-ins were also subject to the whim of nature as inclement weather often caused poor attendance or cancellations. Less than two hundred drive-ins were in operation in the U.S. and Canada by the late 1980s. Since the 1990s they have lapsed into a quasi-novelty status with the remaining handful catering to a generally nostalgic audience, with many drive-ins continuing to successfully operate in some areas, mostly on the West Coast. Newer theaters opened during this time, as well as a handful of them reopened. By 2013, drive-ins comprised only 1.5 percent of movie screens in the United States, with 389 theaters in operation. At the industry's height, about 25 percent of the nation's movie screens had been in a drive-in.|$|E
5000|$|A {{land owner}} of an estate cannot give a [...] "greater interest" [...] in the estate than he or she owns. That is, a life estate owner cannot give {{complete}} and indefinite ownership (fee simple) to another person because the life tenant's ownership in the property ends when {{the person who is}} the measuring life dies. For instance, if Ashley conveyed to Bob for the life of Bob, and Bob conveys a life estate to another person, Charlie, for Charlie's life embedded life estate, then Charlie's life <b>estate</b> <b>interest</b> would last only until Charlie or Bob dies. Charlie's life interest or pur autre vie interest (interest for the life of another, whichever has applied) and most often the remaining rights of ownership in the property (the 'reversionary interest') devolve to the persons {{under the terms of the}} will/rules of intestacy/declaration of trust/trust deed (UK) or will/rules of intestacy/'grant or deed of life interest' (or similar) (U.S.) in remainder or revert to the original grantee, depending on terms of Ashley. Such a life estate in the U.S. can also be conveyed for the life of the grantor, such as [...] "A conveys X to B until A dies" [...] and in the UK by trust transferring upon trust or assigning rather than conveying X.|$|E

5000|$|In the United States, a {{life estate}} is {{typically}} {{used as a}} tool of an estate planning. A life estate can avoid probate and ensure that an intended heir will receive title to real property. For example, Al owns a home and desires that Bill inherit it after Al's death. Al can effectuate that desire by transferring title to the home to Bill and retaining a life estate in the home. Al keeps a life estate and Bill receives a vested fee simple remainder. As soon as Al dies, the life <b>estate</b> <b>interest</b> merges with Bill's remainder, and Bill has a fee simple title. Such a transfer risks the small risk of a fraud on the part of beneficiary Bill if he could easily show in a particular jurisdiction an unfettered fee simple, selling the estate prematurely to an innocent purchaser such as when Al is on vacation but makes the use of a will unnecessary and eliminates the need to probate the asset. A second disadvantage to the grantor is that provision for any remainderman (or men) (party C) is irrevocable without the remainderman's consent. [...] "Beneficiary deeds" [...] have been statutorily created in some states to address this issue.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – Many {{associations}} in the Farm Credit System, which are financial cooperatives, pay their member-borrowers a cash patronage payment {{based on the}} amount of loan volume with the association. In today's competitive lending environment, some Farm Credit associations have offered lower interest rates on new loans but these new member-borrowers have to forgo their cash patronage payment to receive this new, lower-interest rate loan. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to identify Farm Credit member-borrowers' preferences for patronage refunds received as a cash payment versus lower fixed real <b>estate</b> <b>interest</b> rates. Design/methodology/approach – Preferences for patronage refunds or lower fixed interest rates are elicited from Farm Credit Services of East Central Oklahoma member-borrowers via conjoint analysis. Findings – Results show that member-borrowers strongly prefer patronage refunds compared to lower fixed interest rates. Originality/value – This paper fulfills a need to better understand patronage refund programs within the Farm Credit System.
