40|$|The study {{examines}} the {{theoretical and practical}} developments in societal planning in Finland, and the link between this and important events in Finnish history and social development. Certain aspects of developments outside Finland are also examined, with the United Kingdom forming the main point of comparison. The study focuses on the period from mercantilism {{to the end of}} the twentieth century. The study concentrates on social policy planning in Finland up {{to the end of the}} 1980 s, at which time the ideology of planning came to a close. The recent planning in Finland is examined in two case studies which deal with the drafting of the 1990 s reform in central government grant for local authorities. The study also includes an annex containing a review of planning theories and methods. The results of the study reveal a number of distinct periods in the development of societal planning in Finland. The differences between these periods are connected with changes in Finnish society. Planning has received impetus from wars and from the need to preserve social harmony, and in periods of economic upturn. The same development trend is also found in other countries. The economic recession of the early 1970 s put an end to the planning boom in Finland. The improvement in economic circumstances at the end of the decade did not, however, lead to a planning revival, but instead the impact of market forces in social development grew stronger on a wave of neoliberal ideology. Although planning was on the decline, there began one of Finland's most significant planning reforms of the entire century: the reform in central government grant for local authorities. There were actually two reforms, one beginning in 1989 and the other in 1995. The study critically examines the drafting of the reforms and concludes that in many respects this did not meet the requirements generally set for planning. The material of the study comprised mainly literature of societal planning, committee reports and <b>documents</b> <b>of</b> <b>parliament.</b> Endast sammandrag.

Given a new document to be recommended, the system will decide what Members of the Par-liament could find interesting such a document, in order to deliver it to them.

40|$|The {{first part}} [of the present paper] seeks {{to put the}} {{openness}} debate in context, by examining the different facets of openness and transparency, the important roles <b>of</b> European <b>Parliament,</b> the Ombudsman, the European Court of Justice and citizens groups in helping to promote greater openness, {{as well as the}} differing approaches to openness and transparency within Member States. The second part of the paper outlines the progressive extension of openness and transparency within EU in recent years, including the development of a formal Treaty base and the evolving situation within the various EU institutions and bodies, notably the establishment of new codes of conduct on public access to their documents. The final section of the paper reviews the present state of openness and transparency within EU, and the areas where insufficient progress has been made. In particular, it reviews the recent debate on the implementing rules on public access to the <b>documents</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Parliament,</b> Commission and Council, and the various issues that have arisen {{in the course of this}} debate...|$|R

The Privy Council instructed that Philip and Mary should be joint signatories <b>of</b> royal <b>documents,</b> and this was enacted by an Act <b>of</b> <b>Parliament,</b> which gave him the title of king and stated that he [...] "shall aid her Highness ... in the happy administration of her Grace’s realms and dominions."

Formally, King Philip was to co-reign with his wife according to the Act, which nevertheless ensured that the new king would not become too powerful by prohibiting him from appointing foreigners to any offices, taking his wife or any child that might be born to them outside her realm and claiming the crown for himself should he outlive his wife [...]|$|R
40|$|This article {{evaluates the}} level of {{integration}} of Members <b>of</b> the European <b>Parliament</b> from Central and Eastern Europe in the European Parliament after the EU enlargements of 2004 and 2007. The main objective is to address the puzzle of how the European Parliament’s political groups could maintain or even increase their voting cohesion after the influx of a significantly large number of new MEPs coming from countries with different historical experience, socio-economic characteristics, and political and party systems. Three indicators of MEP integration are defined: integration into parliamentary leadership, integration into parliamentary work, and integration into voting patterns. The article uses data from the VoteWatch. eu website on MEPs’ activities and voting between the years 2004 - 2011, as well as data from official <b>documents</b> <b>of</b> the European <b>Parliament</b> and its political groups. Analysis of the data reveals that the new member states’ MEPs were significantly under-represented in parliamentary leadership and key legislative activities, {{despite the fact that}} their voting loyalty to their political groups was greater than that of their colleagues from older member states...|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the Dutch and Flemish policies towards immigrants in the 1970 s and 1980 s and the role attributed to language in them. It examines the arguments and concepts by which both the policies were motivated and legitimated and evaluates critically their usual periodization. It points out {{the risk of a}} wrong reading of the Dutch "tweesporenbeleid" of the 1970 s as based on multiculturalism instead of expectation of return of the immigrants into their home country. It concentrates on the Minderhedennota of 1981 / 83 as the main turning point leading to the interpretation of the allochton-issue as socio-economic problem and examines the public debate on the basis <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> <b>of</b> the Dutch <b>parliament.</b> The acquisition <b>of</b> Dutch as second language, it states, always {{played a crucial role in}} the policies. Since the 1980 s, more attention was paid to evaluation of school curricula in terms of non-discrimination of non-native speakers. In the Flemish case, less systematical approaches were stated. The policies were less centralized and crucially influenced by the fact of bilinguism and the competition between Dutch and French in Belgium. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|R
