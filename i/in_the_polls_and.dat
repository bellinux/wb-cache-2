While initially trailing Coakley in polling by a large margin, Brown saw a sudden late surge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> <b>and</b> posted a surprise win to become the first Republican elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts since Edward Brooke in 1972. Brown ran for a full Senate term in 2012, but lost to Democratic challenger Elizabeth Warren.

25|$|Cooper's {{thirteen}} years as Buckeye head coach are largely remembered in {{the litany of}} negative statistics associated with him: a notorious 2–10–1 record against Michigan, a 3–8 record in bowl games, a 5-year losing streak to Illinois to start his term and a 6-7 record overall, and blowing a 15-point 3rd quarter lead in a 28–24 loss to unranked Michigan State when the Buckeyes were the top-ranked team {{in the nation and}} en route to a national championship. However his record also has many positives: back-to-back victories over Notre Dame, two finishes second-ranked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls,</b> <b>and</b> three Big Ten championships (albeit shared).

However, the Alliance increased their overall vote totals by over one million and reduced the Progressive Conservatives to 12 seats in the House of Commons. The Liberals' attacks on Day ended up decimating the NDP and Progressive Conservatives, as many voters who would otherwise have supported those parties voted strategically for the Liberals to prevent an Alliance victory.|$|E
