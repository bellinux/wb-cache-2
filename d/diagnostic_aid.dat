Endogenous plasma epinephrine concentrations in resting adults are normally less than 10ng/L, but may increase by 10-fold during exercise and by 50-fold or more during times of stress. Pheochromocytoma patients often have plasma adrenaline levels of 1000â€“10,000ng/L. Parenteral administration of epinephrine to acute-care cardiac patients can produce plasma concentrations of 10,000 to 100,000ng/L.|$|E
40|$|Summary Background Diagnostic {{errors are}} well {{documented}} in the literature and emphasise the need to teach diagnostic skills {{at an early stage}} in medical school to create effective and safe clinicians. Hence, there may be a place for <b>diagnostic</b> <b>aids</b> (such as the Surgical Sieve) that provide a framework for generating ideas about diagnoses. With repeated use of the Surgical Sieve in teaching sessions with students, and prompted by the traditional handheld wheels used in antenatal clinics, we developed the Compass Medicine, a handheld diagnostic wheel comprising three concentric discs attached at the centre. We report a preliminary study comparing the Surgical Sieve and the Compass Medicine in generating differential diagnoses. Methods A total of 48 third-year medical students from Cardiff University participated in a study aimed at measuring the efficacy of <b>diagnostic</b> <b>aids</b> (Surgical Sieve and Compass Medicine) in generating diagnoses. We quantified the effect each aid had on the number of diagnoses generated, and compared the size of the effect between the two <b>diagnostic</b> <b>aids.</b> There may be a place for <b>diagnostic</b> <b>aids</b> that provide a framework for generating ideas about diagnoses Results The study suggests that both <b>diagnostic</b> <b>aids</b> prompted users to generate a greater number of diagnoses, but {{there was no significant difference}} in the size of effect between the two <b>diagnostic</b> <b>aids.</b> Discussion We hope that our study with <b>diagnostic</b> <b>aids</b> will encourage the use of robust tools to teach medical students an easily visualised framework for diagnostic thinking...|$|R

25|$|Leukoedema lesions {{disappear}} {{when the}} mucosa is stretched, which helps to differentiate it from other white lesions in the mouth. The differential diagnosis is with leukoplakia, oral candidiasis, oral lichen planus, white sponge nevus, morsicatio buccarum, hereditary benign intraepithelial dyskeratosis and dyskeratosis congenita. Tissue biopsy is not indicated, but when taken, the histologic appearance {{is one of}} increased epithelial thickness, broadening and eleongation of the rete ridges, parakeratosis and intracellular edema of the spinous layer. The cells of the spinous later are vacuolated, large and possess pyknotic nuclei. The superficial squamous cells have a clear, seemingly empty cytoplasm {{but it has not}} been shown that there is an increase in intracellular water, possibly making the term edema misleading. The histologic appearance is thought to be caused by water within the cells of the spinous layer causing the light to reflect back as whitish.

40|$|Healthcare {{workers are}} now being {{targeted}} for marketing of diagnostic tools for mastitis that were developed for the dairy industry and which aim to provide information regarding choice of antibiotic treatment. Meanwhile, scientists are striving {{to understand how the}} human microbiome affects health and wellbeing and the importance of maintenance of bacterial balance in the human body. Breast milk supplies a multitude of bacteria to populate the baby's intestinal tract and kick-start the immune system. Researchers propose a paradigm shift in the understanding of bacterial content in breast milk and an alternative paradigm for the understanding of lactational mastitis: there is the beginning of evidence that many cases of lactational mastitis will resolve spontaneously. An international group of researchers is attempting to answer how dietary habits, birth mode, genetics and environmental factors may impact the bacterial content of breast milk. Until we have more comprehensive knowledge about the human milk microbiome, <b>diagnostic</b> <b>aids</b> for identification of women in need of antibiotic therapy for mastitis remain unreliable. <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>aids</b> could lead to the injudicious use of antibiotic therapy, which in turn may rob the infant of bacteria valuable for development of its immune system.
