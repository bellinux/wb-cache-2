Aim To identify, quantify and assess the risk associated to the management of hospital residues. Material and methods: A cross sectional assessment <b>of</b> the <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> hazardous <b>waste</b> from a hospital, between June and August 2005, was performed. The environmental risk associated to the management <b>of</b> non-radioactive hospital <b>waste</b> was assessed and the main problems related to solid waste were identified. Results: The rate <b>of</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> hazardous non-radioactive <b>waste</b> was 1. 35 tons per months or 0. 7 kg/bed/day. Twenty five percent <b>of</b> hazardous liquid <b>waste</b> were drained directly to the sewage system.

50|$|Many {{traditional}} chemical conversions used {{in various}} industries suffer from inherent drawbacks from both {{an economic and}} environmental viewpoint. Non-specific reactions can afford low product yields, copious amounts of waste and impure products. The need for elevated temperatures and pressures leads to high energy consumption and high capital investment costs. Disposal of unwanted by-products may be difficult and/or expensive and hazardous solvents may be required. In stark contrast, enzymatic reactions are performed under mild conditions of temperature and pressure, in water as solvent, and exhibit very high rates and are often highly specific. Moreover, they are produced from renewable raw materials and are biodegradable. In addition, the mild operating conditions of enzymatic processes mean {{that they can be}} performed in relatively simple equipment and are easy to control. In short, they reduce the environmental footprint of manufacturing by reducing the consumption of energy and chemicals and concomitant <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste.</b>|$|E
