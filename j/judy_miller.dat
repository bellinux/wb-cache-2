Believing that more people would turn out for the march on a Sunday, and so as to mark the date of the start of the Stonewall uprising, the CSLDUC scheduled the date for the first march for Sunday, June 28, 1970. With Dick Leitsch's replacement as president of Mattachine NY by Michael Kotis in April 1970, opposition to the march by Mattachine ended.|$|E

25|$|Retirement didn't last long. Astaire {{returned}} {{to the big screen}} to replace the injured Kelly in Easter Parade (1948) opposite <b>Judy</b> Garland, Ann <b>Miller,</b> and Peter Lawford and for a final reunion with Rogers (replacing Judy Garland) in The Barkleys of Broadway (1949). Both of these films revived Astaire's popularity and in 1950 he starred in two musicals - one for M-G-M - Three Little Words with Vera-Ellen and Red Skelton and one on loan-out to Paramount - Let's Dance with Betty Hutton. While Three Little Words did quite well at the box office, Let's Dance was a financial disappointment. Royal Wedding (1951) with Jane Powell and Peter Lawford proved to be very successful, but The Belle of New York (1952) with Vera-Ellen was a critical and box-office disaster. The Band Wagon (1953), which is considered {{to be one of the}} finest musicals ever made, received rave reviews from critics and drew huge crowds. But because of its excessive cost, it failed to make a profit on its first release. Soon after, Astaire, along with all the other remaining stars at M-G-M, was let go from his contract because of the advent of television and the downsizing of film production. In 1954, Astaire was about to start work on a new musical, Daddy Long Legs (1955) with Leslie Caron at 20th Century Fox, when his wife Phyllis became ill and suddenly died of lung cancer. Astaire was so bereaved that he wanted to shut down the picture and offered to pay the production costs out of his own pocket. However, Johnny Mercer (the film's composer) and Fox studio executives convinced him that work would be the best thing for him at that time. When Daddy Long Legs was released in 1955, it did only moderately well at the box office. His next film for Paramount, Funny Face (1957), teamed him with Audrey Hepburn and Kay Thompson and despite the sumptuousness of the production and the strong reviews from critics, it failed to make back its cost. Similarly, Astaire's next project - his final musical at M-G-M, Silk Stockings (1957), in which he co-starred with Cyd Charisse, also lost money at the box office. As a result, Astaire withdrew from motion pictures for two years.|$|R

50|$|Meetings to {{organize}} the march began in early January at Rodwell's apartment in 350 Bleecker Street. At first there was difficulty getting {{some of the major}} New York City organizations like Gay Activists Alliance (GAA) to send representatives.

5000|$|<b>Judy</b> <b>Miller,</b> {{a gifted}} Jewish college senior, {{presents}} a short play to her Greek Theater professor, Henry Harper. Judy submits an updated, anti-nuclear version of Antigone {{in place of}} the formal paper that Harper has assigned to her. Harper is adamant in his refusal to accept her paper and threatens to fail her (and hence keep her from graduating) if she doesn't provide a more traditional paper. A battle of wills ensues, as both of them refuse to budge from their convictions. She produces her play on campus, as tensions continue to mount. Judy also lodges a complaint with the university grievance committee, which elicits a visit from the dean not only to plead with Harper to soften his stand, but also to warn him that accusations of anti-Semitism (however unfounded) have arisen. The play ends with the Professor, like Creon of Sophocles' Antigone, cast out from his home and left to wander, while Judy's fate is unknown, except that her life's dreams and goals have been so challenged that its anyones guess if the [...] "old" [...] Judy even exists anymore.|$|E

5000|$|Two {{explanations}} of which event in Carroll's life {{gave rise to}} The Hunting of the Snark have been offered. Biographer Morton N. Cohen connects the creation of The Hunting of the Snark with the illness of Carroll's cousin and godson, the twenty-two-year-old Charlie Wilcox. On 17 July 1874, Carroll travelled to Guildford, Surrey, to care for him for six weeks, while the young man struggled with tuberculosis. The next day, while taking {{a walk in the}} morning after only a few hours of sleep, Carroll thought of the poem's final line: [...] "For the Snark was a Boojum, you see." [...] Fuller Torrey and <b>Judy</b> <b>Miller</b> suggest that the event that inspired the poem was the sudden death of Carroll's beloved uncle, Robert Wilfred Skeffington Lutwidge, caused by a violent mentally-ill patient in 1873, during Lutwidge's time as an inspector of lunatic asylums. They support their analysis with parts of the poem, such as the Baker's uncle's advice to seek the Snark with thimbles, forks, and soap, which, according to Torrey and Miller, were all items the lunatic asylum inspectors checked during their visits.|$|E

Originally titled Gilda Radner: Live From New York (renamed Gilda Live for the film debut), it had a steady success as a play but the movie itself and the record as well, both released in March 1980, were complete flops with critics and the public. The Gilda Live movie was shot in Boston {{a few weeks before}} the start of Saturday Night Lives 5th season (late summer/early autumn of 1979). (It was decided not to film it in New York because of union problems.) More footage for the film was shot at The Brooklyn Academy of Music in December 1979. The film itself was basically a rehash of Radners most popular Saturday Night Live characters and sketches. It included Roseanne Roseannadanna, Emily Litella, Candy Slice, <b>Judy</b> <b>Miller,</b> Lisa Loopner, Nadia Comăneci, and Rhonda Weiss, and many other skits and performances such as [...] "Lets Talk Dirty To The Animals" [...] (which was a little more risque than the original TV version, as this version was the only scene that got the film an R rating), [...] "I Love To Be Unhappy", [...] "Goodbye Saccharine" [...] and [...] "Honey (Touch Me With My Clothes On)". Skits were also performed by Don Novello as Father Guido Sarducci. The tagline to the film was: [...] "Things like this only happen in the movies." ...|$|E
