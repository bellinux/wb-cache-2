25|$|All {{amplifiers}} generate {{heat through}} electrical losses. The amplifier must dissipate this heat via convection or forced air cooling.

25|$|An <b>electronic</b> <b>component</b> that is {{intended}} to add inductance to a circuit is called an inductor. Inductors are typically manufactured from coils of wire.

25|$|A {{varistor}} is an <b>electronic</b> <b>component</b> with {{an electrical}} resistance that {{varies with the}} applied voltage. Also known as a voltage-dependent resistor (VDR), it has a nonlinear, non-ohmic current–voltage characteristic {{that is similar to}} that of a diode. In contrast to a diode however, it has the same characteristic for both directions of traversing current. At low voltage it has a high electrical resistance which decreases as the voltage is raised.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} popular types of {{open-source}} hardware is electronics. There are numerous companies that provide large varieties of open-source electronics such as Sparkfun, Adafruit and Seeed. In addition, there are NPOs and companies that provide a specific open-source <b>electronic</b> <b>component</b> such as the Arduino electronics prototyping platform. There are numerous examples of speciality open-source electronics such as low-cost voltage and current GMAW open-source 3-D printer monitor and a robotics-assisted mass spectrometry assay platform. Open-source electronics finds various uses, including automation of chemical procedures.|$|E
25|$|Microelectronics {{engineering}} {{deals with}} the design and microfabrication of very small electronic circuit components for use in an integrated circuit or sometimes for use on their own as a general <b>electronic</b> <b>component.</b> The most common microelectronic components are semiconductor transistors, although all main electronic components (resistors, capacitors etc.) can be created at a microscopic level. Nanoelectronics is the further scaling of devices down to nanometer levels.

25|$|Later, {{the area}} became Radio Row. New York City's Radio Row, which existed from 1921 to 1966, was a {{warehouse}} district on the Lower West Side in the Financial District. Harry Schneck opened City Radio on Cortlandt Street in 1921, {{and eventually the}} area held several blocks of electronics stores, with Cortlandt Street as its central axis. The used radios, war surplus electronics (e.g., ARC-5 radios), junk, and parts often piled so high they would spill out onto the street, attracting collectors and scroungers. According to a business writer, it also was {{the origin of the}} <b>electronic</b> <b>component</b> distribution business.|$|E
25|$|A diode is a two-terminal <b>electronic</b> <b>component</b> that conducts current {{primarily}} {{in one direction}} (asymmetric conductance); it has low (ideally zero) resistance in one direction, and high (ideally infinite) resistance in the other. A semiconductor diode, {{the most common type}} today, is a crystalline piece of semiconductor material with a p–n junction connected to two electrical terminals. A vacuum tube diode has two electrodes, a plate (anode) and a heated cathode. Semiconductor diodes were the first semiconductor electronic devices. The discovery of crystals' rectifying abilities was made by German physicist Ferdinand Braun in 1874. The first semiconductor diodes, called cat's whisker diodes, developed around 1906, were made of mineral crystals such as galena. Today, most diodes are made of silicon, but other materials such as selenium and germanium are sometimes used.|$|E
25|$|Originally, every <b>electronic</b> <b>component</b> had wire leads, and the PCB had holes drilled {{for each}} wire of each component. The components' leads were then {{passed through the}} holes and {{soldered}} to the PCB trace. This method of assembly is called through-hole construction. In 1949, Moe Abramson and Stanislaus F. Danko of the United States Army Signal Corps developed the Auto-Sembly process in which component leads were inserted into a copper foil interconnection pattern and dip soldered. The patent they obtained in 1956 {{was assigned to the}} U.S. Army. With the development of board lamination and etching techniques, this concept evolved into the standard printed circuit board fabrication process in use today. Soldering could be done automatically by passing the board over a ripple, or wave, of molten solder in a wave-soldering machine. However, the wires and holes are wasteful since drilling holes is expensive and the protruding wires are merely cut off.|$|E

500|$|The {{behaviour}} of many {{electronic components}} {{can be described}} using matrices. Let A be a 2-dimensional vector with the component's input voltage v1 and input current i1 as its elements, and let B be a 2-dimensional vector with the component's output voltage v2 and output current i2 as its elements. Then the behaviour of the <b>electronic</b> <b>component</b> can be described by [...] B = H · A, where H is a 2 x 2 matrix containing one impedance element (h12), one admittance element (h21) and two dimensionless elements (h11 and h22).
