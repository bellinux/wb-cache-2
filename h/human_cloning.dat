5|$|FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) {{has made}} a name for himself working on X-Files—unexplained cases which may be paranormal in origin. He is {{appointed}} a partner in these investigations—Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson)—with his superiors hoping that she will be able to debunk and discredit his work. Their first case together is the investigation of possible abductions in Oregon, which falters when their evidence is destroyed in a fire. A later case, involving the disappearance of a United States Air Force test pilot, sees the introduction of secretive informant Deep Throat (Jerry Hardin), who continues to provide the agents sensitive information. This help is supplemented by conspiracy theorist group The Lone Gunmen, who are contacted for help in a further abduction case. Deep Throat is soon killed, however, when he helps the agents uncover details of a government <b>human</b> <b>cloning</b> program, and the X-Files unit is closed shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Much of Raël's {{advocacy}} concerning futuristic {{technology is}} described in his 2001 book, Yes to <b>Human</b> <b>Cloning.</b> He supported human genetic engineering {{in order to avoid}} genetically inherited diseases and to reduce the economic burden on society. He said that no distinctive emphasis needed to be allocated to a particular race or religion. Elsewhere in the book, he stated that nanotechnology will make it possible to have micro-distributive power generation (essentially a power plant in each house), fur-like furnishings that are self-cleaning with hair-like fibers that move on their own, and biological robots. Nanostructures control biology, so Raël expected that meat and salads will someday be grown in a machine via molecular construction.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} indicates {{a lack of}} clear international guidelines on the permissibility of {{embryonic stem cell research}} and <b>human</b> reproductive <b>cloning.</b> These studies suggest that this is the result of severe criticism from uninformed publics, whose arguments are based on misconceptions influenced by popular literature and science fiction films. However, the current research argues that public cloning attitudes that are based on real social and ethical concerns should be deployed to direct social and legal policy-making on <b>human</b> reproductive <b>cloning.</b> Addressing public concerns about <b>human</b> reproductive <b>cloning</b> is essential in exploring sound avenues for sensible biotechnology and policy-making. The research, on which this article reported, intended to give a critical evaluation of some major arguments for and against <b>human</b> reproductive <b>cloning</b> in order to establish whether or not these arguments hold up well under rational interrogation. Notwithstanding the author’s critical attitude to uninformed opinions, false assumptions and unsound conclusions about the complex issue of <b>human</b> reproductive <b>cloning,</b> the author argued from the perspective that every life phenomenon is inextricably intertwined with everything else, and part of larger complex webs of interactions. Such a perspective recognised that the well-being of other human beings, including future <b>human</b> <b>clones,</b> is not only an existential, social and moral imperative but also epistemological. Against the backdrop of this perspective, critical questions arose that justified the creation of <b>human</b> <b>clones</b> in the face of possible defects and abnormalities in cloned children, as well as the possible harm to societies...|$|R

Costa Rica proposed the adoption of {{an international}} convention to ban all forms of <b>human</b> <b>cloning.</b> Unable to reach a consensus on a binding convention, in March 2005 a non-binding United Nations Declaration on <b>Human</b> <b>Cloning,</b> calling for the ban {{of all forms of}} <b>human</b> <b>cloning</b> contrary to human dignity, was adopted.|$|E
