5|$|The game's {{score system}} {{is based on}} a {{multiplier}} bar and a hit gauge counter. As the player destroys enemy cores, the hit counter increases. Points awarded for destroyed cores are multiplied by the value of the hit counter. The counter decreases when the player stops destroying cores. However, if the multiplier reaches a certain amount <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>begin</b> to flash, awarding large point bonuses for any cores destroyed during this short period of time.|$|E

25|$|Dating {{back two}} hundred years, {{there have been}} {{disputes}} over the management and usage of the San Juan River forming the border between Nicaragua and Costa Rica. The San Juan River has long been viewed, for both countries, as offering the promise for a canal route across Central America. This was the case when the Panama Canal site was chosen rather than the San Juan River as the ultimate ship navigation route across the Americas. The conflict between Nicaragua and Costa Rica continues.

25|$|The solidus {{temperatures}} of most rocks (the temperatures below {{which they are}} completely solid) increase with increasing pressure {{in the absence of}} water. Peridotite at depth in the Earth's mantle may be hotter than its solidus temperature at some shallower level. If such rock rises during the convection of solid mantle, it will cool slightly as it expands in an adiabatic process, but the cooling is only about 0.3°C per kilometer. Experimental studies of appropriate peridotite samples document that the solidus temperatures increase by 3°C to 4°C per kilometer. If the rock rises far enough, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>begin</b> to melt. Melt droplets can coalesce into larger volumes and be intruded upwards. This process of melting from the upward movement of solid mantle is critical {{in the evolution of the}} Earth.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 2000s, No.33 Squadron had been {{transferred}} to the recently re-established No.84 Wing, and AMTDU to No.85 Wing, while the Base Support Wing had been superseded by Combat Support Unit Richmond. No.36 Squadron, having transferred its C-130Hs to No.37 Squadron and re-equipped with the C-17 Globemaster, relocated to RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, in November 2006. The RAAF's DHC-4 Caribous, which had been operated for some years by No.38 Squadron out of RAAF Base Townsville, were retired {{at the end of}} 2009, to be replaced by Super King Airs built by Hawker Pacific.

25|$|Externally, {{the most}} obvious feeding {{structure}} of the mosquito is the proboscis. More specifically, the visible part of the proboscis is the labium, which forms the sheath enclosing {{the rest of the}} mouthparts. When the mosquito first lands on a potential host, its mouthparts will be enclosed entirely in this sheath, and it will touch the tip of the labium to the skin in various places. Sometimes, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>begin</b> to bite almost straight away, while other times, it will prod around, apparently looking for a suitable place. Occasionally, it will wander for a considerable time, and eventually fly away without biting. Presumably, this probing is a search for a place with easily accessible blood vessels, but the exact mechanism is not known. It is known that there are two taste receptors {{at the tip of the}} labium which may well play a role.|$|E
