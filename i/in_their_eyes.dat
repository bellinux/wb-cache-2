5|$|Some Western {{academics}} cautiously {{view the}} hadith collections as accurate historical sources.

Muslim scholars on the other hand typically place a greater emphasis on the hadith literature instead of the biographical literature, since hadiths maintain a verifiable chain of transmission (isnad); the lack of such a chain for the biographical literature makes it less verifiable <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
