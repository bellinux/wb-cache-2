5|$|As {{the fare}} {{system has been}} {{integrated}} by TransitLink, commuters need to pay only one fare and pass through two fare gates (once on entry, once on exit) for an entire journey for most interchange stations, even when transferring between lines operated by different companies. Commuters can choose to extend a trip mid-journey, and pay the difference when they exit their <b>destination</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E
5|$|Any rider {{may take}} {{unlimited}} trips {{of up to}} 30 minutes, measured from when the bike is withdrawn from a dock to when it is returned. (If a <b>destination</b> <b>station</b> is full, riders can use the kiosk to get 15 more free minutes to return the bike to another location.) Longer trips incur fees for each additional half-hour {{on a scale that}} rises from $1.50 to $8.00. These prices are designed to encourage short trips from place to place instead of longer leisure rides.|$|E
25|$|The Nol Card {{are used}} by the {{passengers}} to check-in and check-out at the gates in their <b>destination</b> <b>station.</b> The fare will be automatically deducted {{based on the number}} of zones traveled. Passengers will be allowed to check-in when their card has more than minimum credit required.|$|E

25|$|In 1611, the European {{merchant}} William Finch {{had described}} Delhi {{as the city}} of seven castles (forts) and 52 gates. More gates were built after that period during the Mughal rule and during the British rule. Currently, only 13 gates exist in good condition, while all others are in ruins or have been demolished. Like all gates denote, {{the direction of the}} <b>destination</b> <b>station</b> is the starting name of the gate.|$|E
25|$|Yellow tactile tiles {{are used}} at all {{stations}} {{to guide the}} visually impaired. The tiles start at the ramp and lead to the staircases and lifts. Disabled and elderly passengers can avail a wheelchair at all metro stations. The wheelchair {{can be used by}} the passenger to board a train and then dropped off at the <b>destination</b> <b>station.</b> In February 2017, the BBMP and the BMRC began a project to upgrade all footpaths along the Phase 1 route. The project is estimated to cost 40 crore and is scheduled to be completed in 18 months.|$|E
25|$|When a {{subscriber}} {{dialed the}} number of a manual station, an operator at the destination office answered the call after seeing the number on an indicator, and connected the call by plugging a cord into the outgoing circuit and ringing the <b>destination</b> <b>station.</b> For example, if a dial customer calling from TAylor 4725 dialed a number served by a manual exchange, e.g., ADams 1383-W, the call was completed, from the subscriber’s perspective, exactly as a call to LEnnox 5813, in an automated exchange. The party line letters W, R, J, and M were only used in manual exchanges with jack-per-line party lines.|$|E

25|$|The {{ticketing}} system uses RFID contactless technology with round tokens issued for single trips and a contactless stored value card, the MRT Plus card, for frequent travellers. It is planned that a joint {{ticketing system}} will be set up so that passengers can use a single ticket on the MRT {{as well as on}} the Skytrain. Multi-storey park & ride facilities are provided at Lat Phrao and Thailand Cultural Centre. Motorists who park their cars at these premises will be issued with additional contactless smartcards and they need to have them electronically stamped at their <b>destination</b> <b>station.</b> The turnstiles accept cards or tokens, both available from a manned booth or automated ticket machines.|$|E
25|$|BMRCL {{began selling}} tokens through {{automatic}} ticket vending machines (ATVMs) on 4 December 2012 at the MG Road, Indiranagar and Baiyyappanahalli stations. The service {{will eventually be}} expanded to all metro stations. The touchscreen enabled ATVMs are available in 3 languages – English, Kannada and Hindi. Commuters can purchase a single journey token by selecting the <b>destination</b> <b>station</b> or the amount in the ATVM. They can also add value or add trips to the contactless smart card. Commuters can purchase up to 8 tickets {{at a time and}} can get the receipt print for card recharge. ATVMs accept coins of 5 and 10 denominations and 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 denominations of currency notes. However, the ATVM cannot differentiate between 1 and 2 coins.|$|E
25|$|Magnetic strip plastic {{tickets were}} used, in various forms. Stored-value tickets were called farecards {{and came in}} three types: the blue farecard was issued to adults, the magenta farecard to senior citizens, and the red farecard to children. Single-trip forms of these tickets were {{retained}} at the faregates on exiting the paid area of a <b>destination</b> <b>station.</b> Monthly discounted tickets were available in four values: beige, pink, and purple tickets for primary and tertiary students, and full-time national servicemen came with a value of S$13, S$30 and S$36, respectively; the peach ticket was for secondary, pre-university and VITB students, costing S$17 each. These discounted tickets were valid for a month from the date of purchase, allowed up to four trips a day, and were non-transferable.|$|E
5000|$|In telecommunications, {{destination}} routing is a sequential pathway that messages {{must pass}} through {{to reach a}} target destination. In electronic switching systems for circuit based telephone calls, the <b>destination</b> <b>stations</b> are identified by a station address or more commonly, a destination telephone number.|$|R
50|$|There are {{regular train}} {{services}} {{from other parts}} of the UK to the south west, principal <b>destination</b> <b>stations</b> being Barnstaple, Exeter, Newquay, Penzance and Plymouth. From these places local trains or buses connect to many points of the path. Airports at Exeter and Newquay are served from a range of national and international destinations.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the {{equilibrium}} distribution of a queueing network with batch routing is of product-form if a batch which cannot enter the <b>destination</b> <b>stations,</b> for example {{as a consequence of}} capacity constraints, jumps over these stations and selects a new set of <b>destination</b> <b>stations</b> according to the routing probabilities, that is if also customers in the batch who arrive at a non-saturated station jump over that station. Keywords: jump-over blocking, product-form, batch routing, queueing network. 1 Introduction Jackson observed in [3] that the equilibrium distribution of a Jackson network in which the service-speed at a saturated station is set to infinity if a customer arrives at that station still possesses the product-form equilibrium distribution found for Jackson networks without capacity constraints. However, a rigorous proof of this phenomenon is not given in [3]. In [6] this notion of blocking is again discussed. In this reference the service-rate is not set to infin [...] ...|$|R
500|$|Tickets {{are used}} both {{to enter and}} exit the paid area of the system. [...] A ticket {{inserted}} into a fare gate at the station of origin is processed and then ejected allowing a passenger through the turnstile. [...] The ejected ticket is then retrieved while passing through {{so that it can}} be used at the exit turnstile at the <b>destination</b> <b>station</b> to leave the premises. [...] Tickets are captured by the exit turnstiles to be reused by the system if they no longer have any value. [...] If it is a stored value ticket with some value remaining, however, it is once again ejected by the fare gate to be taken by the passenger for future use.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} years of the Stadtbahn, many trains {{previously}} terminating at the old terminuses Lehrter Bahnhof, Görlitzer Bahnhof or Potsdamer Bahnhof operated via the Stadtbahn to reduce the load on the terminus stations. By the end of the 19th century, however, most of these train runs had to terminate at their old <b>destination</b> <b>stations</b> again due to the increasing local traffic on the Stadtbahn.|$|R

5|$|Because {{the rail}} {{operators}} are government-assisted, profit-based corporations, fares on the MRT system are pitched {{to at least}} break-even level. The operators collect these fares by selling electronic data-storing tickets, the prices of which are calculated based on {{the distance between the}} start and <b>destination</b> <b>stations.</b> These prices increase in fixed stages for standard non-discounted travel. Fares are calculated in increments based on approximate distances between stations, in contrast to the use of fare zones in other subway systems, such as the London Underground.|$|R

2500|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{overcome}} losses from theft, the next innovation adopted by bike sharing programmes {{was the use of}} so-called 'smart technology'. One of the first 'smart bike' programmes was the Grippa™ bike storage rack system used in Portsmouth's Bikeabout scheme. The Bikeabout scheme was launched in October 1995 by the University of Portsmouth, UK as part of its Green Transport Plan in an effort to cut car travel by staff and students between campus sites. Funded in part by the EU's ENTRANCE programme, the Bikeabout scheme was a [...] "smart card" [...] fully automated system. For a small fee, users were issued 'smart cards' with magnetic stripes to be swiped through an electronic card reader at a covered 'bike store' kiosk, unlocking the bike from its storage rack. CCTV camera surveillance was installed at all bike stations in an effort to limit vandalism. Upon arriving at the <b>destination</b> <b>station,</b> the smart card was used to open a cycle rack and record the bike's safe return. A charge was automatically registered on the user's card if the bike was returned with damage or if the time exceeded the three-hour maximum. Implemented with an original budget of approximately £200,000, the Portsmouth Bikeabout scheme was never very successful in terms of rider usage, in part due to the limited number of bike kiosks and hours of operation. Seasonal weather restrictions and concerns over unjustified charges for bike damage also imposed barriers to usage. The Bikeabout program was discontinued by the University in 1998 in favour of expanded minibus service; the total costs of the Bikeabout programme were never disclosed.|$|E
50|$|Stations on the MRT {{system are}} divided into two areas, paid and unpaid areas, which allows the rail {{operators}} to collect needed fares by restricting entry only through the fare gates, also known as access control gates. These gates, connected to a computer network, are {{able to read the}} electronic tickets, and can store information such as the amount of time taken per trip, and the start and <b>destination</b> <b>stations</b> of each trip. This allows the rail operators to collect fares based on this information.|$|R

50|$|Because {{the rail}} {{operators}} are government-assisted profit-based corporations, fares and ticketing on Singapore's Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system are currently aimed {{at least in}} breaking even to at least compensate for their costs of running the system. The rail operators collect fares by selling electronic tickets capable of storing data, the price of which {{is calculated based on}} the distance between the start and <b>destination</b> <b>stations.</b> These prices increase in fixed stages for standard non-concessionary travel. From the information that was earlier written in these tickets, it is possible to increase the fare according to increments based on approximate distances between stations.|$|R
50|$|Stations {{have two}} classifications of areas, paid and unpaid areas, which allow the rail {{operators}} to collect fares by restricting entry between the areas {{only through the}} fare gates, also known as access control gates. Commuters enter the paid area in order to board a train; and must enter the unpaid area in order to access the street, and must pass through the gates. These gates, connected to a computer network, are capable of reading and updating electronic tickets capable of storing data, and can store information such as the initial and <b>destination</b> <b>stations</b> and the duration for each trip.
