5|$|A One Day International, or an ODI, is an {{international}} cricket match between two representative teams, each having ODI status, {{as determined by the}} International Cricket Council.

5|$|Praseodymium <b>has</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> {{stable and}} {{naturally}} occurring isotope, 141Pr. It {{is thus a}} mononuclidic element, and its standard atomic weight can be determined with high precision. This isotope has 82 neutrons, a magic number that confers additional stability. This isotope is produced in stars through the s- and r-processes (slow and rapid neutron capture, respectively).|$|E

5|$|A monohedral tiling is a {{tessellation}} {{in which}} all tiles are congruent; it <b>has</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> prototile. A particularly interesting type of monohedral tessellation is the spiral monohedral tiling. The first spiral monohedral tiling was discovered by Heinz Voderberg in 1936; the Voderberg tiling has a unit tile that is a nonconvex enneagon. The Hirschhorn tiling, published by Michael D. Hirschhorn and D. C. Hunt in 1985, is a pentagon tiling using irregular pentagons: regular pentagons cannot tile the Euclidean plane as the internal angle of a regular pentagon, , is not a divisor of 2.|$|E

Two days prior, the Central Government had named the airport after former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who had undergone pilot training in Hyderabad. The naming resulted in opposition from the Telugu Desam Party (TDP). At Begumpet Airport, the international terminal was named after Rajiv Gandhi while the domestic terminal was named after TDP founder N. T. Rama Rao; the TDP wanted to continue this naming convention at the new airport. However, the new airport <b>has</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> terminal.|$|E

5|$|Gene {{nomenclature}} {{has been}} established by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) for each known human gene {{in the form of}} an approved gene name and symbol (short-form abbreviation), which can be accessed through a database maintained by HGNC. Symbols are chosen to be unique, and each gene <b>has</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> symbol (although approved symbols sometimes change). Symbols are preferably kept consistent with other members of a gene family and with homologs in other species, particularly the mouse due to its role as a common model organism.|$|E
5|$|Greene {{retired as}} a player {{following}} the 1981 season. He finished his career having played in 181 {{out of a possible}} 190 games, and recorded 78.5 sacks (unofficially, as sacks were not an official statistic until 1982) and 16 fumble recoveries. His spot in the lineup was technically not replaced; the Steelers switched to a 3–4 defensive alignment for the 1982 season, which <b>has</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> nose tackle as opposed to two defensive tackles. The team has used the 3–4 as its base alignment continuously in the years since Greene's retirement, and more recently have used alignments that deploy only two true linemen.|$|E
5|$|Let {{it not be}} concluded, that I wish {{to invert}} the order of things; I have already granted, that, from the {{constitution}} of their bodies, men seem to be designed by Providence to attain {{a greater degree of}} virtue.

In fact, how can they, if virtue <b>has</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason consequentially, as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there is a God.|$|E

5|$|Rhodium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Rh and atomic number 45. It is a rare, silvery-white, hard, corrosion resistant and chemically inert transition metal. It is a noble metal {{and a member}} of the platinum group. It <b>has</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> naturally occurring isotope, 103Rh. Naturally occurring rhodium is usually found as the free metal, alloyed with similar metals, and rarely as {{a chemical}} compound in minerals such as bowieite and rhodplumsite.

5|$|Taxonomists S. A. Forbes and R. E.

Its closest relatives are the shovelnose sturgeon (Scaphirhyncus platorhynchus), which is still relatively common, and the critically endangered Alabama sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi), which may soon become extinct. These three species belong to the subfamily Scaphirhynchinae, which <b>has</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> other genus, Pseudoscaphirhynchus, represented by three species found in west-central Asia.|$|E
