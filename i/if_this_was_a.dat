5|$|All {{medical records}} and documents, {{including}} Poe's death certificate, have been lost, {{if they ever}} existed. The precise cause of Poe's death is disputed, but many theories exist. Many biographers have addressed the issue and reached different conclusions, ranging from Jeffrey Meyers' assertion that it was hypoglycemia to John Evangelist Walsh's conspiratorial murder plot theory. It has also been suggested that Poe's death might have resulted from suicide related to depression. In 1848, he nearly died from an overdose of laudanum, readily available as a tranquilizer and pain killer. Though it is unclear <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> true suicide attempt or just a miscalculation on Poe's part, it {{did not lead to}} Poe's death a year later.|$|E
5|$|Some of the Kentish crowds now dispersed, {{but others}} continued. From this point, {{they appear to}} have been led by Wat Tyler, whom the Anonimalle Chronicle {{suggests}} was elected their leader at a large gathering at Maidstone on 7 June. Relatively little is known about Tyler's former life; chroniclers suggest that he was from Essex, had served in France as an archer and was a charismatic and capable leader. Several chroniclers believe that he was responsible for shaping the political aims of the revolt. Some also mention a Jack Straw as a leader among the Kentish rebels during this phase in the revolt, but it is uncertain <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> real person, or a pseudonym for Wat Tyler or John Wrawe.|$|E

25|$|According to the New York Times and the Saturday Evening Post, {{the first}} bank robbery in the United States {{occurred}} in March 1831 (the 19th {{according to the}} Times, the 20th according to the Post). Two men, James Honeyman and William J. Murray, entered the City Bank of New York using forged keys. This allowed them to empty the vault of more than $245,000 in bank money. According to the Times, it cannot be confirmed <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> robbery or a burglary. The Post later corrected this claim upon learning of a previous 1798 robbery of $162,821 from the Bank of Pennsylvania at Carpenters' Hall.

It took another eight months for France to convince Universal and the producers to let him try to write a script for a third time. France claimed [...] "Someone within the Universal hierarchy wasn't sure <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> science fiction adventure, or a comedy, and I kept getting directions to write both.

500|$|A vexing {{question}} {{at the time was}} how a production reactor should be cooled. Taking a conservative view that every possible neutron must be preserved, the majority opinion initially favored cooling with helium, which would absorb very few neutrons. Szilard argued that <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> concern, then liquid bismuth would be a better choice. He supervised experiments with it, but the practical difficulties turned out to be too great. In the end, Wigner's plan to use ordinary water as a coolant won out. When the coolant issue became too heated, Compton {{and the director of the}} Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., moved to dismiss Szilard, who was still a German citizen, but the Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, refused to do so. [...] Szilard was therefore present on December 2, 1942, when the first man-made self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction was achieved in the first nuclear reactor under viewing stands of Stagg Field, and shook Fermi's hand.|$|E

500|$|During the 1930s, Brundage's {{rate for}} a cover {{painting}} was $90. [...] Finlay received $100 {{for his first}} cover, which appeared in 1937, over a year after his first interior illustrations were used; Weinberg suggests that the higher fee was partly to cover postage, since Brundage lived in Chicago and delivered her artwork in person, {{but it was also}} because Brundage's popularity was beginning to decline. [...] When Delaney acquired the magazine in late 1938, the fee for a cover painting was cut to $50, and in Weinberg's opinion the quality of the artwork declined immediately. [...] Nudes no longer appeared, though it is not known <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> deliberate policy on Delaney's part. [...] In 1939 a campaign by Fiorello LaGuardia, the mayor of New York, to eliminate sex from the pulps led to milder covers, and this may also have had an effect.In 1936, Howard committed suicide, and the following year Lovecraft died. [...] There was so much unpublished work by Lovecraft [...] that Wright was able to use that he printed more material under Lovecraft's byline after his death than before. [...] In Howard's case, there was no such trove of stories available, but other writers such as Henry Kuttner provided similar material. [...] By the end of Wright's tenure as editor, many of the writers who had become strongly associated with the magazine were gone; Kuttner, and others such as Price and Moore, were still writing, but Weird Tales rates were too low to attract submissions from them. [...] Clark Ashton Smith had stopped writing, and two other writers who were well-liked, G.G. Pendarves and Henry Whitehead, had died.|$|E
500|$|Amlaíb, {{who died}} some four decades later in 980 or 981 whilst in [...] "religious retirement" [...] on Iona, was succeeded by Maccus mac Arailt, who was {{probably}} his nephew. Maccus's brother Gofraid mac Arailt then succeeded him. During their lifetimes these two [...] "sons of Harald" [...] {{are known to}} have launched at least two major expeditions against Ireland, and the latter is recorded as having won [...] "the battle of Man" [...] in 987. Iona was sacked twice, in 986 and 987, Amlaíb Cuarán's later piety notwithstanding. This battle of Man, recorded by the Annals of Ulster, {{is said to have been}} won by Gofraid and [...] "the Danes"– possibly forces directly from Scandinavia under the command of Olaf Tryggvason. The Annals of Ulster record Gofraid's death in Dalriada in 989, describing him as [...] "king of Innse Gall" [...] although it is not clear <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> completely new term or had originally been used earlier, perhaps to refer to Amlaíb Cuarán's island kingdom. The complex geography of western Scotland and the lack of written records makes certainty about the extent and nature of these kingdoms hard to fathom. For example, the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba indicates that almost all these kings who reigned from the mid-10th to the late 11th century were buried on Iona. This may mean that Iona and Mull lay either within or close to the emerging Kingdom of Scotland. Furthermore, two records in the Annals of Innisfallen hint that the Western Isles may not have been [...] "organised into a kingdom or earldom" [...] at this time but rather that they were [...] "ruled by assemblies of freeholders who regularly elected lawmen to preside over their public affairs".|$|E
