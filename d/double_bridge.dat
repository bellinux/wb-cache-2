40|$|A {{new class}} of cyclic <b>double</b> <b>bridged</b> {{diphosphine}} ligands was developed and the coordination properties are described. The reaction of 4, 5 -dilithioxanthene with dichlorophenylphosphine gave a cyclic <b>double</b> <b>bridged</b> diphosphine ligand based on two xanthene backbones (4) as a single stereoisomer. X-ray crystal structure determination revealed that the groups bridging the two phosphorus atoms are arranged in a syn-disposition. This new cyclic bisxantphos structure was modified with bulky residues at the third substituent of the phosphorus atoms, thus forming cavity-shaped ligands...|$|R

50|$|Built in 1845, the Museum Covered Bridge {{originally}} {{spanned the}} Lamoille River in Cambridge, Vermont. The trusses for the <b>double</b> <b>bridge</b> were assembled {{in a field}} next to the chosen site. Measuring 168 feet in length, with two vehicle lanes and a footpath (attached after its original construction), it is an impressive example of the engineering principles and bridge-builder’s craft practiced during the 19th century. The bridge was lighted by kerosene lamps.|$|E
50|$|The {{first serious}} {{obstacle}} that the engineers found was the Riachuelo, a stream {{that defines the}} southern boundary of the Buenos Aires federal district. It was necessary to build a <b>double</b> <b>bridge</b> (because of the double track that ran between Constitución to Barracas) to cross the stream. For that purpose, three iron cylinders were placed in {{both sides of the}} stream, filling them with concrete. The bridges were placed on those cylinders.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Damping in <b>double</b> Cables {{suspension}} <b>bridge</b> {{composed of}} steel reinforcement beams and reinforced concrete tower is non-classical, {{which leads to}} coupled equations of motion in main coordinate system. Based on the complex damping theory, the viscous damping ratio is solved, {{which can be used}} to describe energy dissipation characteristics of non-classical damping system approximately. Seismic response of <b>double</b> chains suspension <b>bridge</b> is analyzed through an example of <b>double</b> chains suspension <b>bridge,</b> considering the geometric nonlinearity and non-classical damping. And numerical calculation is presented for seismic response subjected to independent effect or combination effect of three orthogonal components of seismic wave. Single cable suspension bridge can be taken as a special case of <b>double</b> cable suspension <b>bridge,</b> after the main cable shape coefficient is introduced. The dynamic responses of <b>double</b> cable suspension <b>bridge</b> and single cable suspension bridge are compared to reveal the characteristics of Seismic Response of <b>double</b> cable suspension <b>bridge.</b> The study of the dynamic responses characteristics of <b>double</b> cable suspension <b>bridge</b> has a positive significance on structural form selection of such type bridge during designing, dynamic performance evaluation and reinforcement design has positive significance...|$|R
40|$|Fluorozirconate glasses, such as ZBLAN (ZrF 4 -BaF 2 -LaF 3 - AlF 3 -NaF), {{have a high}} {{infrared}} {{transparency and}} large rare-earth solubility, which makes them an attractive platform for highly efficient and compact mid-IR waveguide lasers. We investigate the structural changes within the glass network induced by high repetition rate femtosecond laser pulses and reveal {{the origin of the}} observed decrease in refractive index by using Raman microscopy. The high repetition rate pulse train causes local melting followed by rapid quenching of the glass network. This results in breaking of bridging bonds between neighboring zirconium fluoride polyhedra and as the glass resolidifies, a larger fraction of single bridging fluorine bonds relative to <b>double</b> <b>bridging</b> links are formed in comparison to the pristine glass. The distance between adjacent zirconium cations is larger for single <b>bridging</b> than <b>double</b> <b>bridging</b> links and consequently an expansion of the glass network occurs. The rarified glass network can be related to the experimentally observed decrease in refractive index via the Lorentz-Lorenz equation. 10 page(s...|$|R

50|$|With the {{introduction}} of diesel-electric motive power, concerns were voiced about the possible danger of having double headed trains using the bridge from 1970. A speed restriction was placed on diesel-electric locomotives using the bridge (20 km/h) {{similar to that used}} for larger steam locomotives. Restrictions were made to cover all trains using the bridge, ensuring that one train only was allowed occupancy of the bridge when passing. The restrictions were not removed until 1975 when the removal of the eastern set of rails was undertaken, thereby singling the <b>double</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Wells Fargo {{strongbox}} {{was often}} the target of stagecoach robbers in Middletown. After the mid-19th century, the payroll money was brought in on the stagecoach with an armed guard beside the driver. Not all of the hold-ups in the area were the doing of Buck and his gang, although he was a scourge to the local vicinity {{for a number of}} years. Buck worked the road near Mountain Hill House, south of Middletown, or near the <b>double</b> <b>bridge</b> north of Middletown near Lower Lake. For 20 years, Buck roamed the countryside, making little effort to hide his identity or his disreputable enterprise.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>double</b> <b>bridge</b> {{with its}} {{two rows of}} arches, {{one on top of}} the other, was {{probably}} built around 1330. It lies at the foot of the southwestern valley side below Rothenburg ob der Tauber and was part of a trade route from Augsburg to Würzburg. In terms of building activity, it is known that it was renovated in 1791, after the four upper arches had collapsed the year before. In 1925 the eastern approach to the bridge was widened and, twenty years later, the structure was blown up by German troops. Rebuilding took a good year and it was reopened on 10 November 1956.|$|E

40|$|The B {{chromosome}} {{of maize}} {{has been used}} in a study of dicentric chromosomes. TB- 9 Sb is a translocation between the B and chromosome 9. The B- 9 of TB- 9 Sb carries 60 % of the short arm of 9. For construction of dicentrics, a modified B- 9 chromosome was used, B- 9 -Dp 9. It consists of the B- 9 chromosome plus a duplicated 9 S region attached to the distal end. In meiosis, fold-back pairing and crossing over in the duplicated region gives a chromatid-type dicentric B- 9 that subsequently initiates a chromatid-type breakage-fusion-bridge cycle. In the male, it forms a single bridge in anaphase II of meiosis and at the first pollen mitosis. However, the cycle is interrupted by nondisjunction of the B centromere at the second pollen mitosis, which sends the B- 9 dicentric to one pole and converts it from a chromatid dicentric to a chromosome dicentric. As expected, the new dicentric undergoes the chromosome-type breakage-fusion-bridge cycle and produces <b>double</b> <b>bridges.</b> A large number of plants with chromosome dicentrics were produced in this way. The presence of <b>double</b> <b>bridges</b> in the root cells of plants with a chromosome dicentric was studied during the first 10 wk of development. It was found that the number of plants and cells showing <b>double</b> <b>bridges</b> declined steadily over the 10 -wk period. Several lines of evidence indicate that there was no specific developmental time for dicentric loss. "Healing" of broken chromosomes produced by dicentric breakage accounted for much of the dicentric loss. Healing produced a wide range of derived B- 9 chromosomes, some large and some small. A group of minichromosomes found in these experiments probably represents the small end of the scale for B- 9 derivatives...|$|R

50|$|The {{river is}} best known for {{establishing}} the borderline at its lower tract. This stretch is crossed not only by aircraft at low height but by important European communication axes, namely AP8 E5 E80 - E70 A63 (motorway, connection at the Biriatu toll), main roads N1 - N10 (connection at the roundabout of Saizar by the river) and major French and Spanish railway networks, - RENFE and SNCF. Besides these major lines, other regional ones cross it too, e.g. regional railway EuskoTren (terminus in Hendaye) and another <b>double</b> <b>bridge</b> (pedestrians/vehicles) joining the towns on the border, i.e. the historical Santiago Bridge (Way of St. James).

50|$|The front {{comprised}} to the west, {{the town}} of Gennes on the south bank, with double suspension bridges connecting the north via an island. The north bank comprised a Levee, which extended east {{for the whole of}} the 40 km front, behind which is a lower old flood plain. Small villages built into the southern bank cliffs, overlooking the river and a number of islands in the river, filled the 20 km until Saumur which had another <b>double</b> <b>bridge</b> of stone via the Offard island which is 1.5 km by 0.5 km and was covered in buildings, overlooked by the ancient Château de Saumur. A rail line over a bridge just to the east of Saumur entered a tunnel into the cliffs on the south bank. Another 20 km further east, along which {{there were a number of}} small villages, also built into the cliffs overlooking the river and more small islands is {{the town of}} Montsoreau with a truss road bridge across the river.Preparations were made to destroy the four bridges, over which refugees were streaming south. Sappers from 6th Engineers based at Angers arrived with lorries loaded with explosives. Barricades were set up and fighting pits dug. The students and troops were allocated into groups of around 20 students called a Brigade. Four or five brigades made a Troop. Each Brigade had a task, some being static and others in reserve were given transport so they could rush to threatened areas. Each bridge was given one Brigade, a section of tirailleurs, a 25mm cannon, two mortars and a heavy machine gun. Between each bridge were two Troops. Communications were established using the civilian telephone system and some old radios. Sadly for the defenders, the river level had recently fallen revealing multiple sand banks and small islands.|$|E
