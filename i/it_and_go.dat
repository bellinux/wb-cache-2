Faust {{had not expected}} men without children to watch it, but said, [...] "The fact that they did {{and that they were}} open-minded and cool enough and secure in their masculinity enough to embrace it and love <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> online and talk about how much they love it—I'm kind of proud." [...] Of her surprise to the unexpected fandom, Faust said, [...] "From the messages I've received, these episodes have lifted spirits, brought parents and kids together, changed perspectives and inspired the most unlikely of people in the most unlikely of places. Who would have thought it from a show about candy colored ponies?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Iconic" [...] {{was chosen}} to be the opening song from the Rebel Heart Tour (2015–16). It begins with a video {{featuring}} Madonna in a glamorous dress cavorting with bare-bodied males juxtaposed with Mike Tyson talking inside of a cage. Tyson commented about the shooting, saying: [...] "Riveting is not [...] It's just intense... I'm in a cage. I'm a hostage. I'm chained. I'm naked. I look like a savage. When I [...] it, it didn't seem that intense. But then you watch <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>go,</b> 'Whoa'. It was like [...] National Geographic. I need to be tamed, man." [...] Madonna performed wearing an [...] "ornate kimono-like robe with wide sequin-lined sleeves" [...] inside a medieval-looking cage surrounded by religious iconography that she later breaks out of as she sings the first lines, while guards dressed {{similar to the ones}} who guarded the Wicked Witch of the West's castle marched onstage. During the performance, she also hung upside down on a cross.|$|E
500|$|Madonna herself {{would later}} say: [...] "I wouldn't say I regret it. I've made {{mistakes}} and learned from them. Most {{people want to}} hear me say that I regret publishing my Sex book. I don't. What was the problem was releasing my Erotica album at the same time. I love that album and it got overlooked." [...] However, author Andy Koopmans in his book Madonna (2002) would comment that the singer regretted both publishing Sex and recording Erotica and that the book [...] "had affected everything she did later". It was not until 2003 that Madonna would once again declare that she regretted nothing; [...] "I'm not apologizing in any shape or form [...] I was interested in pushing buttons and being rebellious and being mischievous and trying to bend the rules. There was a lot of irony in the Sex book and I am poking fun at a lot of things and I am being kind of silly and adolescent and I am being very f you, if a man can do it, I can do it." [...] A year earlier on 2002, Naomi Campbell confessed to [...] "have {{a lot of respect for}} Madonna being bold enough to come out and do a book on sex. I've never reneged on that". However, in 2009, rapper Vanilla Ice, who was Madonna's boyfriend at the time of the book's creation, confessed to not being happy with the book once he saw it. [...] "My friends were like, 'Dude, that's cool man', but I was like, 'I'm dating her, it's not cool to see your girlfriend with all these other people' [...] It kinda ruined the whole thing. I wonder what her kids think of that book? Here she is writing kids' books now but they're going to see <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>go,</b> 'Mommy, what were you thinking?'" [...] Another of the book's models, actress Isabella Rossellini, told Out magazine that she regretted her participation on the book; [...] "I don't think the book worked, even though the photos were extraordinary, and some of them quite memorable. I think there was a little bit of a moralistic sort of 'I'll teach you how to be free!' – and that bothered the hell out of me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shinoda {{spoke to}} Co.Create about the album's art, {{saying that it}} will [...] "blow [...] away...the average person {{is not going to}} be able to look at <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>go,</b> I {{understand}} that that's completely new, like not just the image but the way they made the image is totally new. So there's going to be that." [...] The band underwent 360 degree body scans for numerous lyric videos and artwork for the album. On April 9, 2012, the band released a teaser video for the album on Tumblr. The album's art was released on April 16, 2012, along with the album's first single, [...] "Burn It Down".|$|E
2500|$|Lead actor Andy Whitfield was {{initially}} hesitant to audition {{because he and}} his wife had just had a baby, and because he would have to accept deferred payment. His agent compelled him to consider the role as it was a lead in a feature film: [...] "What you‘ve always wanted to do." [...] Whitfield auditioned without any expectations of getting the role, which meant [...] "he didn't really care as much" [...] and he was free to [...] "go for <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> nuts" [...] without any pressure. After getting the role, it was his wife who encouraged him to accept it by telling him it would be an inspiring thing to tell his son.|$|E

2500|$|Thorne and Taylor {{later become}} {{involved}} again in 2011, when they team {{up against the}} Forresters for mistreating them. Tylo said: [...] " [...] probably equally feels that Thorne deserves to {{have a shot at}} Forrester in the driver’s seat. Taylor does not like the way Brooke has been running everything through Ridge." [...] However, Tylo saw that there was a [...] "sticky point" [...] between them because of Darla, and noted that Taylor [...] "would do anything to make up for that". The actress said, [...] "I think it’s very cool that there is so much history behind the two characters. First of all, it does not seem like a sexually based relationship. So I think the audience can appreciate <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>go,</b> 'Wow. [...] I can understand these two emotionally bonding,' and then let it grow into something that doesn’t look forced." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the success}} of Interview with the Vampire (1976), Anne Rice wrote two {{extensively}} researched historical novels, The Feast of All Saints (1979) and Cry to Heaven (1982). Neither of them gave her the critical acclaim or the commercial success of her first novel; the main complaints about The Feast of All Saints were {{that it was too}} heavy and dense to read easily, and most of the reviews for Cry to Heaven were so savagely negative that Rice felt devastated. She had been thinking about a story set during the time of Oscar Wilde for the next novel, but decided to abandon <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> back to the erotic writing she had explored in the 1960s. Her idea was [...] "to create a book where you didn't have to mark the hot pages" [...] and [...] "to take away everything extraneous, as much as could be done in a narrative". To gain a creative freedom for the new work, Rice adopted the nom de plume A.N. Roquelaure from the French word Roquelaure, referring to a cloak worn by men in the 18th-century Europe. Rice came out as the author of the trilogy only sometime during the 1990s.|$|E
2500|$|Brian Statham and Roy Tattersall {{had just}} arrived from snowbound Lancashire and were thrown into this minor game to get their first cricket since September. They each took a wicket, but the honours belonged to the {{previously}} underperforming Bob Berry who returned figures of 6/36 as the South Australian team were shot out for 84. The real shock occurred when a blonde fast bowler called Lou Curtis – ironically from Berri, South Australia – took 5 wickets before stumps after David Sheppard (37) and Reg Simpson (30) added 60 for the first wicket. He continued {{the next day and}} took 9/60 despite Denis Compton making 40 and Freddie Brown a punchy 77 to take the MCC to 234 and a lead of 150. This proved to be enough as the Country XI were out for 124, the wickets shared around the team. Tim Wall the South Australian state selector invited Curtis to the Adelaide Oval for a state trial, but he refused as he had to return to his wheat farm. [...] "The cricket season", he explained [...] "is the busiest time on the farm, especially with the harvesting. I don't intend to leave my brothers to <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> and play cricket".|$|E
