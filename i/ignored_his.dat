Peter of Angoulême and the papal legate were reconciled and the patriarch excommunicated Bohemond, Symeon and the commune {{with the approval of}} the Holy See.

5|$|After the {{cancellation}} of Alpha Flight Northstar appeared in his own miniseries, which mostly <b>ignored</b> <b>his</b> sexuality, and eventually {{became a member of}} the X-Men. During his time in this team he became a mentor to gay teenage mutant Anole, who later became a Young X-Men member along with another gay teen, Graymalkin. Notable also in Northstar's tenure in the X-Men was his death in three separate continuities in the same month. Other LGBT members of Marvel's mutant teams were X-Statixs Phat, Vivisector, and Bloke (until their deaths) and the villain Mystique, the latter having been in a relationship with the character Destiny, although this was not explicitly revealed until years after the relationship had ended with Destiny's murder.|$|E
5|$|As a scout for the Houston Astros, Hal Newhouser {{evaluated}} Jeter extensively {{before the}} 1992 MLB draft. The Astros held the first overall {{pick in the}} draft, and Newhouser, convinced that Jeter would anchor a winning team, lobbied team management to select him. The Astros feared that Jeter would insist on a salary bonus of at least $1million to forgo his college scholarship for a professional contract, so they passed on him, instead choosing Cal State Fullerton outfielder Phil Nevin, who signed with Houston for $700,000. Newhouser felt so strongly about Jeter's potential that he quit his job with the Astros in protest after they <b>ignored</b> <b>his</b> drafting advice.|$|E

5|$|On May 25, 1948, {{during the}} battle for the Old City, {{commander}} of the Jordanian Arab Legion, Major Abdullah el-Tell, wrote to Otto Lehner of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement to warn that unless the Haganah abandoned its positions in the synagogue and its adjoining courtyard, he would be forced to attack it. Moshe Russnak, commander of the Haganah in the Old City, <b>ignored</b> <b>his</b> request, knowing that if the Hurva fell, {{the battle for the}} Jewish Quarter would soon be lost. On May 26, 1948, the Jordanian Arab Legion delivered an ultimatum to the Jews to surrender within 12 hours; otherwise the Hurva would be bombarded.|$|E

5|$|Alpha Flights Northstar, {{a member}} of the {{original}} Alpha Flight superhero team, was the first major gay character created by Marvel Comics. Creator John Byrne said that Northstar was planned to be gay from his inception in 1979. The character was finally revealed to be gay in 1992's Alpha Flight issue 106, the only comic book issue to have been inducted into the Gaylactic Hall of Fame. Storylines involving Northstar in Alpha Flight and his limited series have generally <b>ignored</b> <b>his</b> sexuality: Criticism has been levelled at the fact that in 30 years Northstar has never been shown kissing another man, though he finally kissed his boyfriend Kyle in the first issue of the 2011 relaunch of the series. Northstar eventually became {{a member of}} the X-Men. During his time in this team he became a mentor to gay teenage mutant Anole, who later became a Young X-Men member along with another gay teen, Graymalkin.|$|E
5|$|Connor {{appears in}} the Family Reunion arc of Angel & Faith.

Angel & Faith agree to this in order to gain the piece of Giles's soul in the scythe, but will only help reopen the tear and go to Quor'toth if Connor agrees to it. Connor is living a normal life as a college student studying social work with a girlfriend.

5|$|Fischer {{lived for}} a time in Japan. On July 13, 2004, acting in {{response}} to a letter from U.S. officials, Japanese immigration authorities arrested him at Narita International Airport near Tokyo for allegedly using a revoked U.S. passport while trying to board a Japan Airlines flight to Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila, Philippines. Fischer resisted arrest, and claimed to have sustained bruises, cuts and a broken tooth in the process. At the time, Fischer had a passport (originally issued in 1997 and updated in 2003 to add more pages) that, according to U.S. officials, had been revoked in November 2003 due to his outstanding arrest-warrant for the Yugoslavia sanctions violation. Despite the outstanding arrest-warrant in the U.S., Fischer said that he believed the passport was still valid. The authorities held Fischer at a custody center for 16 days before transferring him to another facility. Fischer claimed that his cell was windowless and he had not seen the light of day during that period, and that the staff had <b>ignored</b> <b>his</b> complaints about constant tobacco smoke in his cell.|$|E

5|$|In {{a bid to}} stem Haidar's rise, the British {{formed an}} {{alliance}} with the Marathas and the Nizam of Golconda, culminating in the First Anglo-Mysore War in 1767. Despite numerical superiority Haider Ali suffered defeats at the battles of Chengham and Tiruvannamalai. The British <b>ignored</b> <b>his</b> overtures for peace until Haider Ali had strategically moved his armies to within five miles of Madras (modern Chennai) {{and was able to}} successfully sue for peace. In 1770, when the Maratha armies of Madhavrao Peshwa invaded Mysore (three wars were fought between 1764 and 1772 by Madhavrao against Haider, in which Haider lost), Haider expected British support as per the 1769 treaty but they betrayed him by staying out of the conflict. The British betrayal and Haider's subsequent defeat reinforced Haider's deep distrust of the British—a sentiment that would be shared by his son and one which would inform Anglo-Mysore rivalries of the next three decades. In 1777, Haider Ali recovered the previously lost territories of Coorg and Malabar from the Marathas. Haider Ali's army advanced towards the Marathas and fought them at the Battle of Saunshi and came out victorious during the same year.|$|E
5|$|The {{collapse}} of South Vietnamese {{forces in the}} Central Highlands came about {{as a result of}} three major factors. Firstly, during much of the war, President Nguyen Van Thieu’s confidence in the ARVN’s intelligence could not be shaken. However, following the capitulation of Ban Me Thuot, Thieu lost all faith in his own military intelligence agencies, when it became evidently clear that the strength of North Vietnamese forces was far greater than what South Vietnamese intelligence agencies had gathered. Consequently, Thieu completely <b>ignored</b> <b>his</b> own military intelligence and the CIA, and made all military decisions by himself without consulting the Joint General Staff. Thus, when Major-General Pham Van Phu requested that Thieu send reinforcements to bolster the strength of South Vietnamese forces in the Central Highlands, Thieu gave him two options: either carry out the President’s orders, or be replaced by somebody who was willing to do so. General Phu chose to implement Thieu’s orders and evacuated his units from II Corps.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the end of}} {{the bombings}} on August 15, 1973, a legal {{challenge}} to the bombings had mounted in United States Federal Court in the case of Schlesinger v. Holtzman. Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman voted against the Case-Church amendment, as she wanted an immediate end to the bombings, and subsequently filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York seeking an order to require such. On July 25, 1973, U.S. District Judge Orrin Grimmell Judd granted summary judgment to Holtzman and issued an injunction ordering the military to refrain from participating in military activities in Cambodia. His order would have become effective on July 27, however, on that day, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit unanimously stayed his order. Holtzman then attempted to get the Circuit Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court overseeing the Second Circuit, Justice Thurgood Marshall, to vacate the stay. Justice Marshall refused to vacate the stay, issuing an in-chambers opinion. Holtzman then turned to Justice William O. Douglas who granted Holtzman's motion to vacate the stay on August 4, 1973, and he ordered the U.S. Military to cease all bombing in Cambodia. The military <b>ignored</b> <b>his</b> order, and six hours later, the other eight Justices of the Supreme Court voted unanimously to reverse Douglas's order.|$|E
