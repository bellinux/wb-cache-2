40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{asks how}} global <b>humanitarian</b> <b>spaces</b> {{are being made}} through the socio-material practices associated with the Cluster Approach for the coordination of humanitarian action. Drawing on in-depth interviews with humanitarian professionals from the UN, the Red Cross/Red Crescent Movement and various humanitarian NGOs, participant observation in cluster training courses, and an extensive documentary review, this dissertation traces the various practices, material arrangements, and knowledge practices through which the Cluster Approach is enacting global <b>humanitarian</b> <b>spaces</b> and achieving a global scale of humanitarian action. Starting with {{an exploration of the}} places and territorializations of global spaces, this dissertation moves into an account of the ways crises are made knowable and sites are connected through the circulation of information within the clusters. The dissertation also looks at the temporal orientations of humanitarian action are implicated in the designation of <b>spaces</b> as specifically <b>humanitarian</b> by different cluster actors, before finally considering how the deployment of different material response items enact different spatial relations and timelines of crisis. Rather than finding that practices are unified or that they enact global <b>humanitarian</b> <b>spaces</b> in a singular way, the dissertation finds that socio-material practices associated with the Cluster Approach are multiple, making different global <b>humanitarian</b> <b>spaces...</b>|$|R

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Taylor & Francis via [URL] article explores the practice and political significance of politicians? journeys to conflict zones. It focuses on the German example, looking at field trips to theatres of international intervention {{as a way of}} first-hand knowledge in policymaking. Paying tribute to Lisa Smirl and her work on <b>humanitarian</b> <b>spaces,</b> objects and imaginaries and on liminality in aid worker biographies, two connected arguments are developed. First, through the exploration of the routinized practices of politicians? field trips the article shows how these journeys not only remain confined to the ?auxiliary space? of aid/intervention, but that it is furthermore a staged reality of this auxiliary space that most politicians experience on their journeys. The question is then asked, second, what politicians actually experience on their journeys and how their experiences relate to their policy knowledge about conflict and intervention. It is shown that political field trips enable sensory/affectual, liminoid and liminal experiences, which have functions such as authority accumulation, agenda setting, community building, and civilizing domestic politics, {{while at the same time}} reinforcing, in most cases, pre-existing conflict and intervention imaginaries. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} whether Customs-related challenges in the Relief Chain, emanating out of Pakistan, are different from the current international consensus on what these challenges entail. Customs is one of the most crucial links in the Relief Chain, having a direct impact on the pace of the humanitarian response in a disaster affected area. It thus becomes critical to study Customs-related challenges in Humanitarian Logistics, which by its very definition aims to provide humanitarian relief in an efficient, cost-effective and hence rapid fashion. This is especially relevant for Pakistan, which is a country with a long history of disasters, both natural and man-made. After establishing a warrant for this research based on an academic literature review, this paper goes on to formulate an international consensus on what the most important Customs-related challenges are in the eyes of experts, policy makers and academics in the field. This is done via a qualitative analysis of U. N. instruments and initiatives, academic journal articles, reports by international humanitarian organizations and regional seminars on the topic. Common themes are identified and congregated in a comparative table, establishing a baseline for further analysis. After this, a keyword search on Relief Web is conducted in order to gain an idea of the on-the-ground Customs-related issues faced by personnel working in this field worldwide. Furthermore, an interview protocol is used to determine what the biggest Customs-related challenges facing Pakistan in this context are. Lastly, all Customs-related challenges in the Relief Chain, identified throughout this report, are aggregated together in the form of one comprehensive comparative table in the last part of this paper. The results lead to the conclusion that on-the-ground Customs-related challenges in Pakistan, as well as in different <b>humanitarian</b> <b>spaces</b> around the world, are much bigger in their scope than the current international consensus on this topic would have us believe. Especially in the case of the U. N. Model Agreement on Customs Facilitation, it is discovered that the document only covers eleven out of the twenty-nine Customs-related challenges identified via this research paper...|$|R
40|$|Humanitarian space' {{denotes the}} {{physical}} or symbolic space which humanitarian agents need to deliver their services {{according to the}} principles they uphold.

This chapter examines how the definition of humanitarianism, as humanitarian assistance in response to conflict-related insecurity, has been broadened from the alleviation of insecurity to the actual provision of security through concepts such as military humanitarian intervention and the Responsibility to Protect, prompting claims that it risks becoming a driver of insecurity in its own right. The chapter also explores the contested notion of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>space,</b> arguing that debates about the extent and protection of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>space</b> have become the foci for key discussions about the security of professional humanitarians and those they aspire to serve.

40|$|This article {{suggests}} that the spaces of British settler colonialism and metropolitan science were interconnected, under-examined, grounds upon which both ethnography and colonial governance developed. Focusing on the governmental and ethnographic activities of Sir George Grey, governor of South Australia, New Zealand and the Cape Colony during the mid-nineteenth century it argues that the origins of ethnography and the specifically <b>humanitarian</b> governance of <b>spaces</b> invaded by settlers were co-constituted. Although anthropologists have long recognised the complicity of ethnography in modern colonialism, the relationship thus runs far deeper and extends far more broadly, than has been appreciated {{in even the most}} incisive critiques. That relationship was also located in violent settler colonial spaces that have been relatively neglected in the anthropological historiography. The article concludes that Grey’s governmental practices, and his representations of them, established the terms upon which cultural genocide could be posited as an humane alternative to racial extermination. On behalf of the British Empire as a whole, he thus reconciled settler colonialism and humanitarian governance...|$|R

40|$|The offset of {{the thesis}} {{is the current}} {{perception}} among {{a broad range of}} Western humanitarian aid organisations that present day humanitarianism is threatened and faces a crisis. The crisis is manifested in the ‘shrinking’ or ‘contraction’ of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>space</b> since humanitarian key principles such as neutrality, impartiality, and independence are being compromised by political-military parties. In order to understand how <b>humanitarian</b> <b>space</b> – as a metaphor for a space where humanitarian thinking and practice is possible – has been shaped over time and how we can understand the current perception of the humanitarian idea facing a crisis, the thesis applies a historical perspective to unfold specific moments in modern time where the idea has been shaped in relation to armed conflicts. Michel Foucault’s genealogy has been used to examine how the <b>humanitarian</b> <b>space</b> has been shaped through discursive battles, ruptures, changes, and continuities in relation to specific historical points in time where some discourses were more dominating and thereby had the power to shape the <b>humanitarian</b> <b>space</b> by opposing themselves to other discourses: The 1860 s’ “philanthropic” discourse; Second World War Holocaust’s “legal” discourse; the “borderless” discourse taking shape after the Nigeria-Biafra war, and the “security” discourse dominating the way humanitarian thinking and practice was being shaped. The thesis examines how these discourses have come to hold important positions over time whereby truths about the humanitarian ide have been constructed. By examining historical sources as representations for the discursive battles, it became clear that historical perceptions of players in the <b>humanitarian</b> <b>space,</b> subject positions –who is the natural receiver and who is the natural contributor of humanitarian assistance – means, purposes and knowledge-power relations significantly shapes the way we understand the humanitarian idea and whether it is in crisis or not. The meanings are constructed in a ‘discursive battlefield’ where humanitarian, political and military players seem to be a continuous part of the formation...|$|E

In order to promptly and adequately respond to the overwhelming needs of the vulnerable people, both the local {{and the international community}} has formed several humanitarian organizations, charged with the responsibility of providing aid and assistance to people affected by crisis, irrespective of their geographical location. Humanitarian organizations require safe passage to carry out their operations; the concept of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>space</b> was developed to ensure this. While preserving <b>humanitarian</b> <b>space</b> in conflict zone is proving challenging to humanitarian organizations because of various factors, it is however clear that the security of aid workers is a major concerns for aid organizations working in areas experiencing social change or armed conflicts. The rates of kidnapping, injuries and deaths of aid workers seems be on the increase, requiring aid agencies to be more security conscious and adopt measures to save guard the lives of their employees. Some measures taken recently by humanitarian organizations include suspending aid when and where the security of their employees is under threat and in some cases withdrawing completely from such environment. Thus, affecting the ability of aid organizations to carry out their mandate and as a result, those who are in dire need of relief and assistance suffer. For there to be an improvement in aid delivery, warring parties should respect the sanctity of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>space</b> and the ethics governing humanitarianism.

40|$|This study {{looks at}} the <b>humanitarian</b> <b>space</b> in Myanmar which {{includes}} not just the humanitarian operations in the country, the access to volatile zones by the humanitarian organisations, the humanitarian principles, but also a space which permits a complementary arrangement of diverse actors holding different positions and skill sets and deliver to those in need. The study {{is based on the}} practical experiences and reflections of these different actors on field and their operations in different regions in order to gauge a more informed approach to the <b>humanitarian</b> <b>space</b> in the country. Following the lifting of international economic sanctions on the country as well as the general elections in November 2015, Myanmar is in transition.

Design/methodology/approach This conceptual paper integrates knowledge management and humanitarian/military logistics literature to offer a research agenda that would help deliver a CHLP. Findings The paper identifies a series of the key challenges that will need to be overcome as part of the development of the concept of CHLP, and it offers some preliminary suggestions for the approaches that might be adopted in order to overcome these. Research limitations/implications Given that the paper has been developed from a theoretical standpoint, the key element of the next stage of the research process is that of corroborating these initial findings with key informants from practitioner organisations drawn from countries across the globe. Practical implications Whilst significant progress has been made in developing the practice of humanitarian logistics, further improvements in both the efficiency and effectiveness have the potential to save lives and reduce suffering.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} humanitarian aid provided {{to people in}} emergencies. It concerns a short-term material and logistical assistance provided from humanitarian sources. The basic objective of the assistance is saving human lives, providing basic human needs such as food, shelter and sanitary conditions. There are several forms of providing humanitarian assistance. The usual form of such is of a material nature. Among the best known providers are Administration of State Material Reserves, central storehouses of Firefighters Corps, assistance from regions and municipalities, non-governmental, non-profit organizations and assistance from business people and individuals. In order to receive a material aid, {{we have to be}} adequately prepared for it. Another from of assistance is of a financial nature which is the most attractive; affected communities buy material they really need. The goal of this thesis was to devise a system and procedures during receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid in communities affected by an emergency situation. Questionnaires sent out to municipalities with extended powers in South Bohemia region served as a methodology for processing. The aim of the questionnaire was to find out the conditions for securing the acceptance, distribution and storing humanitarian aid in relevant municipalities, securing alternative or emergency accommodation for inhabitants from municipalities affected by an emergency situation. A concrete proposal was suggested in the municipality of Veselí nad Lužnicí where I devised a safe location for storerooms and a base for <b>humanitarian</b> aid. <b>Space</b> serving as a storage place is designed in a way to meet all conditions needed for both personnel in charge of receipt and evidence of humanitarian aid, and for proper storage of material and handling equipment.

40|$|Why is humanitarianism {{unable to}} deliver {{value to the}} people {{receiving}} its aid? During the 2008 Russo-Georgian war, approximately 26, 000 people were displaced from South Ossetia into Georgia. In the wake of this disaster, the Georgian government began constructing new settlements for internally displaced people (IDPs) {{with the help of}} Western aid agencies. Although these housing projects were intended to create a new sense of community among IDPs, it was soon clear that the residents there felt trapped by their surroundings. As a result, IDPs viewed the settlements as temporary shelters rather than permanent residents. Therefore, what was originally promoted as a new home for IDPs was more accurately regarded as camp. I argue that this breakdown occurred through the mistranslation of value. On humanitarian terms, value is conceived of in a narrow framework where houses equate basic survival and land a source of economic livelihood. The production of this <b>humanitarian</b> subject and <b>space,</b> however, did not accommodate the broader social impact of displacement. Because the 2008 war disrupted social networks, collective histories, and a longstanding dependence on the land, IDPs are not only economically but also spiritually impoverished. In that humanitarianism is unable to consider these losses, the process by which it tries to reproduce community are hollow. Ultimately, the humanitarian camp and the housing units within it only stand as empty placeholders for a broader sense of value among IDPs living there...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMilitary {{organizations}} are {{well suited to}} contend with the uncertainty of the operating environment and collection and analysis of large amounts of information after a natural disaster. However, due to their finely tuned decision-making processes, militaries tend to be isolated from other relevant actors in the <b>humanitarian</b> <b>space,</b> not always aware of the technologies developed to overcome the gap of information that humanitarian actors confront in face of natural catastrophes and complex emergencies. Analysis of the natural disasters that occurred in Thailand in 2004; Pakistan, 2005; Haiti, 2010; and Chile, 2010 and 2014 provide examples of best practices and lesson learned that can help improve future disaster relief operations.

40|$|Analyses of {{refugee camps}} have criticised Agamben's {{conceptualisation}} of exception, {{understood as the}} juridical production of ‘bare life’ by the sovereign. They have emphasised the multiplicity of actors and exclusionary dynamics involved {{in the production of}} exception, as well as the politicisation of space. This scholarship has however stayed framed around an ‘exclusionary paradigm’. This article proposes a complementary way to move beyond Agamben's analysis of the camp by reconsidering the idea of a ‘zone of indistinction’ between exclusion and inclusion. It refers to Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan, where many dwellers have a dual status of ‘refugee-citizen’. It analyses how the subject and citizenship are ambiguously constructed as simultaneously excluded and included – and not solely included through an exclusion. To explore these complex spatial dynamics of exclusion and inclusion, the analysis addresses the exercise of three forms of power – sovereignty, discipline and government – by focusing on the materiality of the camp and the practices of authorities managing space. These powers are ambiguously contributing to the inclusion of the camp and its dwellers in the territory of the Jordanian state, {{as well as in the}} neoliberal city of Amman, while maintaining the character of the camp as an excluded <b>humanitarian</b> and temporary <b>space.</b> Through this process, camp dwellers are recast not only as assisted subjects and beneficiaries, but also as autonomous and productive subjects, as well as entrepreneurs and consumers. This article therefore argues that the camp needs to be re-considered as a space of multiple ambiguities and subjectivities aimed at creating a differentiation in the city...|$|R
40|$|Mitigation {{of human}} {{suffering}} in Afghanistan has been a mammoth task and remains a cause of concern. The currently ongoing phase which started in 2001 has been characterized with disregard of IHL, grave human suffering, given {{the increased use of}} more injurious means and methods of warfare by warring parties. In response, the ICRC has been engaging its humanitarian diplomacy to ensure development of IHL and parties compliance it, all for the alleviation and prevention {{of human suffering}}. Based on the hypothesis that, the ICRC humanitarian diplomacy in the armed conflict in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2014 has made positive impact in respect to mitigation of human suffering. The main objective {{of this study was to}} examine the impact of the ICRC humanitarian diplomacy in ensuring the alleviation of human suffering in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2014. In that context following were the specific objectives of the study were; to discuss the humanitarian diplomacy of the ICRC as a key concept in the mitigating human suffering in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2014 as in other armed conflict situations; to discuss asymmetric warfare as a concept and itâ€Ÿs bearing on the mitigation of human suffering in light of the armed conflict in Afghanistan form 2001 to 2014 and to suggest recommendations for the improvement of the effectiveness of the ICRC humanitarian diplomacy in mitigating human suffering in Afghanistan. The study used qualitative research methodology. Data was collected using documentary and key informant, in-depth interviews. In this respect, content and thematic analyses were used in the presentation and analysis of findings. The findings of the study have established that; the humanitarian diplomacy of the ICRC in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2014, has been delivering concrete results in ensuring the alleviation and prevention of human suffering. It resulted to more consideration by warring parties and other relevant stakeholders of the need to mitigate human suffering in Afghanistan, reduction of civilian deaths and casualties, securing of <b>humanitarian</b> access and <b>space</b> by the ICRC to mention but a few. However, the ICRC humanitarian diplomacy in Afghanistan continue to face challenges due to, the realistic nature of warring parties who pursue their self-interests at the expense of mitigation of human suffering, the overemphasis of confidential dialogue by the ICRC where public discussions will be feasible and above all, the discrepancy between the existing body of IHL and the asymmetric internationalized-NIAC in Afghanistan. Against this bedrock, the study surmised that though the ICRC humanitarian diplomacy in Afghanistan may not have been effective in all situations and continues to face challenges, it has made great impact and remains necessary rather than optional. To this end, the study recommended that; for continued relevance of IHL, relevant actors (state and non-state) need to acknowledge the limitations of existing body of IHL and to address them rather than avoiding them, warring parties in Afghanistan should desist from pursuing self-interest in disregard of the human suffering that result from their actions and that, the ICRC should be avoid overemphasising confidential dialogue were public discussions will be feasible...|$|R

Peacekeepers are now deployed in on-going conflicts were there are no peace to keep. This shift includes a robust turn, where the peacekeepers are mandated to use force for a longer-term involvement. In addition, UN´s role as an impartial actor has moved towards the political goal of stabilization. That the UN now {{is seen as an}} impartial actor has highlighted the conflicting interface between the peacekeepers and humanitarian actors, and also raised challenging questions about the preservation of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>space</b> in the new context of UN peacekeeping. The on-going peacekeeping mission in Mali, known by its French acronym MINUSMA, serves {{as an example of the}} new category of UN {{peacekeeping operations}}. Often referred to as the deadliest peacekeeping mission today, MINUSMA has been faced with several challenges since its deployment in 2013, including the threat from jihadist groups. In this thesis, I have studied to what extent a clear division between humanitarian actors and MINUSMA is a precondition for the preservation of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>space</b> in the context of northern Mali. This has been done through so-called analytical eclecticism, where different theoretical approaches on civil-military interaction have been deployed to answer the research question. Based on interviews conducted during a fieldwork in Bamako, I find that that the civil-military interaction in Mali today is limited and challenging. The humanitarians perceive the UN peacekeeping force as an obstacle to their activities, as well as a threat to their security. This must be seen in relation to the volatile nature of the conflict, and the peacekeepers political involvement. The analysis also illustrates that it was easier to conduct humanitarian activities in northern Mali before the deployment of MINUSMA. Accordingly, a clear division between humanitarian actors and MINUSMA is to a large extent seen as a precondition to preserve <b>humanitarian</b> <b>space...</b>|$|E

In order to do so, the paper is organized in three steps: (i) in its first step the paper intends to discuss how IR theory deals with the concept of “the political”; (ii) the second movement argues that despite the IR theory disagreement on what constitutes “the political ” in the international relations, it is possible, as Nicholas Onuf has already,done, to identify genealogically a “republican legacy ” in the shaping of “the international ” as well as the international thought; (iii) the third and final step examines the emergency of the <b>humanitarian</b> <b>space</b> as an arena in which the state of exception is legalized, acquiring a permanent status.

Comments are welcome. 2 Meta‐Theoretical Conversations Levels are not just taxonomic convenience for sholars, or a methodological expedient. They are a potent metaphor, an ancient convention, for marking, and thus making, wholes. (Nicholas Onuf, The Republican Legacy o...|$|E
30|$|The next {{question}} is ‘what is new’? While {{there might be}} disagreement as to the historical trajectory and geographical scope of ‘safeguarding’, it also appears that something is new in the landscape surrounding safeguarding and that this newness will inevitably impact its content. Central to this are the rapidly evolving and sometimes overlapping global political and legal initiatives addressing sexual exploitation, harassment and prostitution. A useful way to scope ‘newness’, therefore, is to map out the changing policy contexts of the sexual exploitation of beneficiaries, the sexual harassment of subordinates and co-workers, the acquisition of commercial sexual services and, finally, the general technologization of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims to {{find the}} most intellectually responsible way to address the idea of humanitarianism in/through art education. I argue for creating a reverential condition in which to study atrocious images. I suggest that art education can have a unique role to address spectatorship of suffering in order to open <b>humanitarian</b> <b>space</b> in an educational setting. The key implications are: 1) art education can be an important site for social justice, civic engagement, and world peace and 2) art educators can take the initiative to coalesce around pressing global issues through an integrated curriculum. In this report, I highlight the research objectives, rationale, and significance of this study...|$|E
30|$|Research on the {{efficacy}} of humanitarian supply chains has, in recent years, intensified due partly to the increasing human and monetary cost of natural disasters and conflict. Considerable attention has focused on challenges impacting relief chain structures, including maintaining <b>humanitarian</b> <b>space,</b> mobilizing suppliers, meeting donor interests, coordinating transportation resources, and organizing local distribution activity (e.g., Kleinfeld 2007; Kovacs and Spens 2007; de Silva 2009; Balcik et al. 2010; Hilhorst and Jansen 2010; da Costa et al. 2014). Others have examined factors impacting humanitarian service delivery, including coordination difficulties, issues arising with disconnection between humanitarian needs and donor demands, {{and the relationship between}} the public and private sector (Simo and Bies 2007; Balcik et al. 2010).|$|E
