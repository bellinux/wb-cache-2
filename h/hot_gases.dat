The scope and time frame of information gathering is generally responsive to the boundaries set by the National Research council (NRC), but includes a broad range of interests and programs which cover <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> cleanup through the year 2010.

5|$|The HPOTP turbine and HPOTP {{pumps are}} {{mounted on a}} common shaft. Mixing of the fuel-rich <b>hot</b> <b>gases</b> in the turbine section and the liquid oxygen in the main pump can create a hazard and, to prevent this, the two {{sections}} are separated by a cavity that is continuously purged by the engine's helium supply during engine operation.

5|$|The Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk was {{the first}} {{operational}} aircraft designed to use stealth technology to minimize its radar cross-section; it began operations in secrecy in 1983. Its low detectability was traded-off against performance in other areas, including reduced thrust and only subsonic speed. The aircraft's faceted shape reduced the reflection of radar back to the receiver, {{at the expense of}} making the aircraft aerodynamically unstable, requiring a fly-by-wire flight system to maintain controlled flight. The infrared signatures of stealth aircraft can be reduced by designing exhaust nozzles to mix the <b>hot</b> <b>gases</b> with cool ambient air, by placing the nozzles above the wing to conceal them from ground-based observers, and by avoiding the use of afterburners, as with the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit bomber.|$|E
5|$|The thermal {{diffusion}} process was based on Sydney Chapman and David Enskog's theory, which explained that when a mixed gas passes through a temperature gradient, the heavier one tends to concentrate at the cold end and the lighter one at the warm end.

Dickel in Germany in 1938. It was developed by US Navy scientists, but was not one of the enrichment technologies initially selected for use in the Manhattan Project. This was primarily due to doubts about its technical feasibility, but the inter-service rivalry between the Army and Navy also played a part.|$|E

40|$|We use Chandra and XMM-Newton {{to study}} the <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> content {{in a sample of}} field early-type galaxies. We find that the L_X-L_K {{relationship}} is steeper for field galaxies than for comparable galaxies in groups and clusters. The low <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> content of field galaxies with L_K < L_star suggests that internal processes such as supernovae driven winds or AGN feedback expel <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> from low mass galaxies. Such mechanisms may be less effective in groups and clusters where the presence of an intragroup or intracluster medium can confine outflowing material. In addition, galaxies in groups and clusters may be able to accrete gas from the ambient medium. While there is a population of L_K < L_star galaxies in groups and clusters that retain <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> halos, some galaxies in these rich environments, including brighter galaxies, are largely devoid of <b>hot</b> <b>gas.</b> In these cases, the <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> halos have likely been removed via ram pressure stripping. This suggests a very complex interplay between the intragroup/intracluster medium and <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> halos of galaxies in rich environments with the ambient medium helping to confine or even enhance the halos in some cases and acting to remove gas in others. In contrast, the <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> content of more isolated galaxies is largely a function of the mass of the galaxy, with more massive galaxies able to maintain their halos, while in lower mass systems the <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> escapes in outflowing winds.

5|$|Hot springs {{are closely}} {{associated}} with fumaroles, which are vents in an active volcanic area releasing steam and <b>hot</b> <b>gases,</b> such as sulfur dioxide. In general, the water is rotating groundwater that comes into contact with rocks heated by magma and finds openings to the surface. The formation of the springs depends both on the rocks the water has passed through and the profusion of volcanic discharges mixed with the groundwater. Iron oxide, iron sulfides and other substances usually colour pools of boiling mud brilliant yellow, red, brown or green. Hot springs comprising significantly softened silica may deposit it to form siliceous sinter, whereas those comprising softened calcium carbonate deposit spongy-looking calcareous rock called tufa. Overflow of the springs can build masses, spires or stepped terraces of calcareous sinter or tufa.|$|E
5|$|The offset boiler {{and coal}} bunker caused the locomotive's {{centre of gravity}} to be shifted to one side. Experiments had to be {{undertaken}} to balance the locomotive by filling the linking corridor with large quantities of scrap metal, replaced in a re-design by a raised floor, covering the weighted material. These modifications resulted in the engine exceeding the total weight limit of 150 tons (151 tonnes), severely limiting the design's route availability during testing. A related problem was that despite being a tall locomotive, at , the cab ceilings were relatively low. The cab at the smokebox end of the locomotive suffered from the same excessive heat as did the fireman's cab. To circumvent this problem the locomotive was used in reverse, as the rear cab was next to the water tank and coal chute and therefore away from the <b>hot</b> <b>gases</b> circulating inside the smokebox.|$|E
5|$|The {{oxidizer}} {{and fuel}} preburners are welded to the hot-gas manifold. The fuel and oxidizer enter the preburners and are mixed so that efficient combustion can occur. The augmented spark igniter {{is a small}} combination chamber located {{in the center of}} the injector of each preburner. The two dual-redundant spark igniters, which are activated by the engine controller, are used during the engine start sequence to initiate combustion in each preburner. They are turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is then self-sustaining. The preburners produce the fuel-rich <b>hot</b> <b>gases</b> that pass through the turbines to generate the power needed to operate the high-pressure turbopumps. The oxidizer preburner's outflow drives a turbine that is connected to the HPOTP and to the oxidizer preburner pump. The fuel preburner's outflow drives a turbine that is connected to the HPFTP.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{experimental}} {{study on the}} operating performance for a novel reverse-cycle <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> defrosting method for air source heat pumps (ASHPs). Firstly, a description of both an experimental prototype ASHP unit where the novel reverse-cycle <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> defrosting method may be realized, and its operating modes are presented. This is followed by reporting an experimental set up for testing the defrosting performance of the prototype ASHP unit using the novel thermal energy storage (TES) based reverse-cycle <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> defrosting method. Finally, experimental results are presented and discussed. The experimental results suggested {{that the use of}} the novel reverse-cycle <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> defrosting method for the experimental ASHP unit was able to help shorten the defrosting time by ∼ 3 min or 38 %, and minimize the risk of shutting down the ASHP unit due to low suction pressure through increasing the compressor's suction pressure by about 200 kPa, when compared {{to the use of the}} traditional standard reverse-cycle <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> defrosting method. In addition, when the TES based reverse-cycle <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> defrosting method was used, the mean indoor coil surface temperature during defrosting was about 25 K higher than that when the traditional standard reverse-cycle <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> defrosting method was used. These results suggested that as compared to the use of the traditional standard reverse-cycle <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> defrosting method, the use of the novel TES based defrosting method would enable a quicker space heating resumption, impacting less on indoor thermal environment due to defrosting. Hence, the novel TES based defrosting method was proven to be effective in reducing the current problems in ASHPs using standard reverse-cycle <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> defrosting method, such as a longer defrosting time and a poor system reliability.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the potential of}} exploiting the Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect (SZE) to study the properties of <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> in galaxy groups.

We use various models for the <b>hot</b> halo <b>gas</b> to study how the expected SZE signals are affected by gas fraction, equation of state, halo concentration and cosmology. Comparing the model predictions with the sensitivities expected from the South Pole Telescope (SPT), Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and Planck surveys shows that a SPT-like survey can provide stringent constraints on the <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> properties for haloes with masses M 1013 h− 1 M.

40|$|The {{measured}} emission-weighted metal {{abundance of}} the <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> in early-type galaxies {{has been known}} to be lower than theoretical expectations for 20 years. In addition, both X-ray luminosity and metal abundance vary significantly among galaxies of similar optical luminosities. This suggests some missing factors in the galaxy evolution process, especially the metal enrichment process. With Chandra and XMM-Newton, we studied 32 early-type galaxies (kT ≲ 1 keV) covering a span of two orders of L_X, gas/L_K to investigate these missing factors. Contrary to previous studies that X-ray faint galaxies show extremely low Fe abundance (∼ 0. 1 Z_), nearly all galaxies in our sample show an Fe abundance at least 0. 3 Z_, although the measured Fe abundance difference between X-ray faint and X-ray bright galaxies remains remarkable. We investigated whether this dichotomy of <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> Fe abundances can be related to the dilution of <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> by mixing with cold gas. With a subset of 24 galaxies in this sample, we find that there is virtually no correlation between <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> Fe abundances and their atomic gas content, which disproves the scenario that the low metal abundance of X-ray faint galaxies might be a result of the dilution of the remaining <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> by pristine atomic gas. In contrast, we demonstrate a negative correlation between the measured <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> Fe abundance and the ratio of molecular <b>gas</b> mass to <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> mass, although it is unclear what is responsible for this apparent anti-correlation.
