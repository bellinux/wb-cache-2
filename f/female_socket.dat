Both are female, 16-pin (2x8), D-shaped connectors, {{and both have}} a groove between the two rows of pins. But type B has the groove interrupted in the middle, so you can't plug a type A male connector into a type B socket. You can, however, mate a type B male plug in a type A <b>female</b> <b>socket.</b>|$|E
50|$|For {{high voltage}} use, a special {{sheathed}} {{version of the}} banana plug and socket is used. This version has an insulating sheath around both {{the male and female}} connectors to avoid accidental contact. The sheathed male plug will not work with an unsheathed <b>female</b> <b>socket,</b> but an unsheathed male plug will fit a sheathed <b>female</b> <b>socket.</b>|$|E

50|$|These {{may also}} be {{referred}} to as a caddy - a sheath, typically plastic or metallic, within which a hard disk drive can be placed and connected with the same type of adapters as a conventional motherboard and power supply would use. The exterior of the caddy typically has two <b>female</b> <b>sockets,</b> used for data transfer and power.|$|R
50|$|Connectors usually {{consist of}} (i) a mating pair (plug and receptacle) each {{equipped}} with male (pin) or <b>female</b> (<b>socket)</b> contacts; note {{that at least}} one of the connector halves, or its contacts, should be floating to minimize mechanical stresses.|$|E
50|$|While one {{usage of}} the word pin is to refer to {{electrical}} contacts of, specifically, the male gender, its usage in pinout does not imply gender: the contact-to-function cross-reference for a connector that has only <b>female</b> <b>socket</b> contacts is still called a pinout.|$|E
5000|$|A {{machine taper}} {{is a system}} for {{securing}} cutting tools or toolholders in the spindle of a machine tool or power tool. A male member of conical form (that is, with a [...] ) fits into the <b>female</b> <b>socket,</b> which has a matching taper of equal angle.|$|E
50|$|The usual wiring has the {{positive}} (red) wire {{running to the}} terminal with a square profile, and the negative (black) wire running to the half-circle, half-square terminal. This is true for both genders of connector. The <b>female</b> <b>sockets</b> are in a male housing and the male pins are in a female housing. The male pins (female housing) connector is usually on the battery side.|$|R

50|$|All {{stage pin}} {{connectors}} have longitudinal slits {{in the male}} pins that allow for compression when inserted into the <b>female</b> <b>sockets</b> to increase friction and therefore the mechanical security of the connection. A special tool appropriately called a pin splitter {{may be used to}} expand this slit and spread the two halves of the pin to compensate for wear. A knife may be used to the same effect, but this technique risks both personal injury, damage to the connector, or ruining of the knife blade. For these reasons, a flat-head screwdriver is often used as an impromptu pin splitter.|$|R
5000|$|Some cords contain {{multiple}} female connectors {{in close}} proximity of one another; others have female connectors spaced {{along the length of}} the cord. Cords generally contain either grounded or ungrounded connectors. While a grounded male connector can be forced into an ungrounded <b>female</b> <b>socket,</b> this is unsafe.|$|E

When mated, the spring-loaded cover on the socket hooks over the lug visible on top of the plug to lock the two together.|$|E
50|$|A line-operated AC string with a {{male plug}} on one end and a <b>female</b> <b>socket</b> {{on the other end}} can be {{conveniently}} connected end-to-end with other similar strings. The gauge of wire used, current rating of the fuse (if present) and the power consumption of each string will determine how many strings can be safely daisy-chained this way, or whether the end string will have diminished voltage and brightness.|$|E
5000|$|Four-way X {{connectors}} or six-way star connectors, {{also known}} as spider connectors, with multiple plug sizes and types are common on generic power supplies. Other replacement power supplies have arrangements for changing the power connector, with four to nine different alternatives available when purchased in a set. RadioShack sells universal AC adapters of various capacities, branded as [...] "Enercell Adaptaplug", and fitted with two-pin <b>female</b> <b>sockets</b> compatible with their Adaptaplug connector lineup. This allows many different configurations of AC adapters to be put together, without requiring soldering. Philmore and other competing brands offer similar AC adapters with interchangeable connectors.|$|R
5000|$|Special [...] "octal" [...] {{connectors}} {{with either}} 8 or 11 pins, {{almost identical to}} octal relay sockets or tube sockets, were used to connect power supplies to some tube audio amplifiers, transmitters and tranceivers (especially in amateur radio models). <b>Female</b> <b>sockets</b> were installed on the power supply and male sockets (with exposed pins) on the radio equipment. Cable assemblies with mating connectors were also readily available. These connections transferred anode positive voltage (typically 600 VDC for Heathkit, 800 VDC for Collins), grid negative bias (-130 VDC), 6.3 and 12.6 VAC for heaters (filaments), and control functions (remote mains switching).|$|R

5000|$|The {{most common}} {{arrangement}} remains {{to have the}} male plug on the cable and the <b>female</b> <b>socket</b> mounted {{in a piece of}} equipment: the original intention of the design. A considerable variety of line plugs and panel sockets is available, including plugs suiting various cable sizes, right-angle plugs, and both plugs and sockets in a variety of price ranges and with current capacities up to 15 amperes for certain heavy duty [...] in versions intended for loudspeaker connections.|$|E
50|$|Almost all {{machine tool}} spindles, and many power tool spindles, have a taper {{as their primary}} method of {{attachment}} for tools. Even on many drill presses, handheld drills, and lathes, which have chucks (such as a drill chuck or collet chuck), the chuck is attached by a taper. On drills, drill presses, and milling machines, the male member is the tool shank or toolholder shank, and the <b>female</b> <b>socket</b> is integral with the spindle. On lathes, the male may belong to the tool or to the spindle; spindle noses may have male tapers, female tapers, or both.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{closely related}} type is the {{stackable}} connector for electronics, which typically has male pins on one surface, and complementary <b>female</b> <b>sockets</b> {{on the opposite}} surface, allowing multiple units to be stacked up like plastic milk crates. Examples of this include stackable banana plugs, and interconnect cables specified for the IEEE-488 instrumentation bus. Stackable mezzanine bus connectors are used on some modular microcomputer accessory boards for systems such as the Arduino add-on daughterboards called [...] "shields". The older PC/104 embedded PC modules use a similar stackable format for interconnection. Stackable connectors are not classified as hermaphroditic in the strictest sense, but are often described as such in looser usage.|$|R
50|$|Despite its {{widespread}} adoption, the connector {{does have}} problems. It {{is difficult to}} remove because it is {{held in place by}} friction instead of a latch, and some poorly constructed connectors may have one or more pins detach from the connector during mating or demating. There is also a tendency for the loosely inserted pins on the male connector to skew out of alignment. The <b>female</b> <b>sockets</b> can spread, making the connection imperfect and subject to arcing. Standard practice is to check for any sign of blackening or browning on the white plastic shell, which would indicate the need to replace the arcing connector. In extreme cases the whole connector can melt due to the heat from arcing.|$|R

5000|$|A Motorola {{connector}} {{also known}} as a motorola antenna plug is a common coaxial cable RF connector used primarily in the automotive industry for connecting the coaxial feedline from the antenna to the radio receiver. It is also sometimes used for connecting scanner antennas to scanners. The male plug somewhat resembles an RCA connector in size and shape, but instead of being concentric to the pin, the sleeve is [...] "folded" [...] back over the coax. The pin is soldered to the center conductor of the coaxial cable coming from the antenna, and the grounded side forms a 1.5 inch (38 mm) long sleeve around the coax. The sleeve usually contains one or more longitudinal spring surfaces, which provide reliable electrical contact by wiping against the mating <b>female</b> <b>socket.</b>|$|E
50|$|The cams {{at the end}} of each lever on {{the female}} end align with a {{circumferential}} groove on the male end. When the levers are rotated to the locked position, they pull the male end into the <b>female</b> <b>socket,</b> creating a tight seal up against a gasket. The arms lock into position using an over-center arrangement, preventing accidental decoupling. Because the groove is cut all the way around the male end, there is no specific alignment necessary to couple as there would be with threaded connectors, and there is no opportunity for cross-threading. This results in an error-resistant, faster coupling operation. Because the compression between the two fittings is limited by the size of the cams on the end of the levers and the rotation of the levers themselves, there is also no possibility of over- or under-tightening the fitting; the pressure against the sealing gasket is effectively constant from one coupling operation to the next, reducing possibility of leaks.|$|E

This poses unacceptable risks {{for the security}} of sensitive information. In order to reduce such threat Counter-TEMPEST filters are introduced between the power network and the electronic device power socket. The loss insertions of these protections are directly related to the input impedance of connected devices and the impedance of the power network <b>female</b> <b>socket.</b> In this paper, the performances of a filter are analysed in practical configurations...|$|E
50|$|An elbow is {{installed}} between two lengths of pipe (or tubing) {{to allow a}} change of direction, usually a 90° or 45° angle; 22.5° elbows are also available.

5000|$|In {{some studies}} the eye shape {{has been shown}} to be the key {{differentiating}} feature between males and females. [...] <b>Female</b> eye <b>sockets</b> tend to be smaller, located higher on the face, to have more sharply angled outer edges, and to be closer together at their inner edges (the intercanthal distance). [...] Some FFS alter the orbit shape; data on outcomes is limited.|$|R
50|$|A tee, {{the most}} common pipe fitting, is used to combine (or divide) fluid flow. It is {{available}} with <b>female</b> thread <b>sockets,</b> solvent-weld sockets or opposed solvent-weld sockets and a female-threaded side outlet. Tees can connect pipes of different diameters or change {{the direction of a}} pipe run, or both. Available in a variety of materials, sizes and finishes, they may also be used to transport two-fluid mixtures. Tees may be equal or unequal in size of their three connections, with equal tees {{the most common}}.|$|R
40|$|A {{coupling}} {{for use in}} {{an apparatus}} for connecting a prosthesis to the bone of a stump of an amputated limb is described which permits a bio-compatible carbon sleeve forming {{a part of the}} prosthesis connector to float so as to prevent disturbing the skin seal around the carbon sleeve. The coupling includes a flexible member interposed between a socket that is inserted within an intermedullary cavity of the bone and the sleeve. A lock pin is carried by the prosthesis and has a stem portion which is adapted to be coaxially disposed and slideably within the tubular <b>female</b> <b>socket</b> for securing the prosthesis to the stump. The skin around the percutaneous carbon sleeve is able to move {{as a result of the}} flexing coupling so as to reduce stresses caused by changes in the stump shape and/or movement between the bone and the flesh portion of the stump...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Finite element {{analysis}} has been universally employed for {{the stress and}} strain analysis in lower extremity prosthetics. The socket adapter was the principal subject of interest due to its importance in deciding the knee motion range. OBJECTIVES: This article focused on the static and dynamic stress analysis of the designed hybrid adapter developed by the authors. A standard mechanical design validation approach using von Mises was followed. Four materials were considered for the analysis, namely, carbon fiber, oil-filled nylon, Al- 6061, and mild steel. STUDY DESIGN: The paper analyses the static and dynamic stress on designed hybrid adapter which incorporates features of conventional male and <b>female</b> <b>socket</b> adapters. The finite element analysis was carried out for possible different angles of knee flexion simulating static and dynamic gait situation. METHODS: Research was carried out on available design of socket adapter. Mechanical design of hybrid adapter was conceptualized and a CAD model was generated using Inventor modelling software. Static and dynamic stress analysis was carried out on different materials for optimization. RESULTS: The finite element analysis was carried out on the software Autodesk Inventor Professional Ver. 2011. The peak value of von Mises stress occurred in the neck region of the adapter and in the lower face region at rod eye-adapter junction in static and dynamic analyses, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Oil-filled nylon {{was found to be}} the best material among the four with respect to strength, weight, and cost. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Research investigations on newer materials for development of improved prosthesis will immensely benefit the amputees. The study analyze the static and dynamic stress on the knee joint adapter to provide better material used for hybrid design of adapter...|$|E

Shown is a 9-pin male (DE-9M) connector (plug), and a 25-pin <b>female</b> (DB-25F) connector (<b>socket).</b> The hexagonal pillars (4-40 bolt) at {{both ends}} of each connector have a threaded stud fastening the connectors to the metal panel. They also have threaded sockets to receive jackscrews on the cable shell, holding the plug and socket together.|$|R
5000|$|It {{should be}} mentioned, however, that a special {{condition}} exists: if a male three-conductor plug is partially inserted into a <b>female</b> two-conductor <b>socket</b> {{such that the}} female ring contact bridges the gap of the male plug tip and first ring, then an identical signal will be connected to both these conductors, thus simulating a [...] "Y" [...] connection. Note this is definitely NOT a reliable connection and is only useful in a test or emergency situation. Further note that analog low and line level audio circuits usually tolerate this well if the volume (current) is not excessive, though other cases may not {{be due to the}} typical surge current that occurs at the moment all three conductors engage. Common example of condition: a typical 3.5 mm earphone socket of a mono radio or micro amp has a stereo headphone plug partly inserted. Mono audio should be delivered to both speakers if the plug depth is carefully adjusted in the socket.|$|R
50|$|Plug and socket {{connectors}} {{are usually}} {{made up of}} a male plug (typically pin contacts) and a <b>female</b> receptacle (typically <b>socket</b> contacts), although hermaphroditic connectors exist, such as the original IBM token ring LAN connector. Plugs generally have one or more pins or prongs that are inserted into openings in the mating socket. The connection between the mating metal parts must be sufficiently tight to make a good electrical connection and complete the circuit. When working with multi-pin connectors, it is helpful to have a pinout diagram to identify the wire or circuit node connected to each pin.|$|R
50|$|In {{the most}} normal use, cables have a {{standard}} plug on each end, {{consisting of a}} central male connector, surrounded by a ring. The ring is often segmented to provide spring gripping pressure when mated. Devices mount the <b>socket</b> (<b>female</b> jack), consisting of a central hole with a ring of metal around it. The ring is slightly larger in diameter and longer than the ring on the plug, allowing the plug's ring to fit tightly over it. The jack has a small area between the outer and inner rings which is filled with an insulator, typically plastic (very early versions, or those made for use as RF connectors, used ceramic).|$|R
