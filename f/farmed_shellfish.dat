5|$|As well as {{the wild}} stock, about 79 million metric tons (87 million tons) of food and non-food {{products}} were produced by sea farming in 2010, an all-time high. About six hundred species {{of plants and animals}} were cultured, some for use in seeding wild populations. The animals raised included finfish, aquatic reptiles, crustaceans, molluscs, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, sea squirts, and jellyfish. Integrated mariculture has the advantage that there is a readily-available supply of planktonic food and waste is removed naturally; in cases where the waste would otherwise be harmful, multi-species techniques can used to, e.g., feed <b>farmed</b> <b>shellfish</b> from the waste being produced by farmed salmon. Various methods are employed. Mesh enclosures for finfish can be suspended in the open seas, cages can be used in more sheltered waters, or ponds can be refreshed with water at each high tide. Shrimps can be reared in shallow ponds connected to the open sea. Ropes can be hung in water to grow algae, oysters, and mussels. Oysters can be reared on trays or in mesh tubes. Sea cucumbers can be ranched on the seabed. Captive breeding programmes have raised lobster larvae for release of juveniles into the wild resulting in an increased lobster harvest in Maine. At least 145 species of seaweed—red, green, and brown algae—are eaten worldwide, some long farmed in Japan and other Asian countries; there is great potential for additional algaculture. Few maritime flowering plants are widely used for food but one example is marsh samphire, which is eaten both raw and cooked. A major difficulty for aquaculture is the tendency towards monoculture and the associated risk of widespread disease. In the 1990s, disease wiped out China's farmed Farrer's scallop and white shrimp and required their replacement by other species. Shrimp farming has also caused the destruction of important mangrove forests throughout southeast Asia.|$|E

40|$|Community {{concerns}} about the detrimental effects of <b>shellfish</b> <b>farming</b> on the environment have been increasing {{over the last decade}} in many shellfish producing countries, including in Tasmania, Australia. Environmental effects of <b>shellfish</b> <b>farming</b> can be assessed and managed using risk management processes, which have been developed {{for a wide range of}} human activities. In this study the risk of <b>shellfish</b> <b>farming</b> activities having detrimental impacts on the ecology of the Tasmanian marine environment was assessed using standard risk assessment methodology. This was based on local environmental information and on the level of production, stocking densities, and known husbandry practices in Tasmania compared to farm operations and levels of impact observed in other countries. The risk management process used in this study appears to be applicable to a variety of aquaculture activities. The qualitative risk assessment of detrimental impacts of <b>shellfish</b> <b>farming</b> rated the risk of spread of introduced pests and/or pathogens as high. However, this high risk rating would also apply to many other activities in the marine environment, such as commercial and recreational fishing and sea transport.

Risks of organic enrichment of the seabed and reduced food resources for other filter feeders were both rated as low...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{sets out}} an {{evaluation}} of profitability differentials within <b>shellfish</b> <b>farming</b> activities of the Mont-Saint-Michel Bay. The objective is to examine whether profitability differentials have consequences {{in terms of economic}} dynamics and of management arrangements. The paper divides into four parts. The first part presents a retrospective analysis of <b>shellfish</b> <b>farming</b> activities in the Bay, which are nowadays dominated by Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and Blue mussel (Mytilus edulis). The second part consists in measuring the economic performances of enterprises. The indicators are based on the data provided by two surveys conducted in 2002 (mussel-farming) and 2004 (oyster-farming); methodological difficulties due in particular to the status of <b>shellfish</b> <b>farming</b> land are addressed here. The third part examines the determinants of the profitability for each sector, the profitability being the result of a combination of factors such as natural productivity, technical practices, production costs and products pricing. The last part discusses the implications of profitability differentials. Profitability differentials seem to be correctly reflected in land prices, but not necessarily in the annual ground fees perceived by the Administration. However, <b>shellfish</b> <b>farming</b> profitability should be included in redistributive mechanisms, as its relation to primary resources exploitation and management is not neutral. Thus, empirical evidence suggests that profitability differentials create bargaining powers which influence the results of negotiation between actors regarding the management of the Mont-Saint-Michel Bay...|$|R
5000|$|Spearfishing with barbed {{harpoons}} {{along the}} sea coast was widespread by the Palaeolithic. Fish ponds surrounded Sumerian temples by 2&thinsp;500 BC and a Chinese classical text credited to the 5th-century BC businessman Fan Li is {{the earliest known}} work on fish farming. A surviving fragment of Isidore of Charax's 1st-century Parthian itinerary describes locals freediving for pearls in the Persian Gulf, and Oppian's 2nd-century Halieutics relates the four main Greek and Roman fishing methods as hook-and-line, netting, passive traps, and trident. Traditional fishing boats operate in near-shore waters but, during the late Middle Ages and early Modern period, fishing on the open sea—particularly cod—became important to the economic and naval development of Northern Europe, New England, and Canada. Overfishing along the coasts of the North Sea spurred the development of deep-sea fishers such as the Brixham and otter trawlers, which might serve as motherships for longlining dories; in the 19th century, advances such as rail transport, canning, and refrigeration allowed fishing to become a full-fledged industry. Improvements in sonar during the world wars were adapted as fishfinders and, during the 1950s, great factory ships caught and processed as many fish in an hour as earlier trawlers had in a season. By the 1960s, the North Atlantic and North Pacific fisheries were close to maximal exploitation. After the catch from wild marine fisheries grew from 18 million metric tons (20 million tons) in 1950 to around 85 million metric tons ( [...] million tons) by the late 1980s, it has remained essentially constant since. Chinese economic reform led to massive growth of its fishing production, from 7% of the world total in 1961 to 35% by 2010. Scientific studies of population dynamics and nationalization of formerly shared waters are both helping to cope with overexploitation but the success of modern commercial fishing has required major corrective actions: {{the collapse of the}} Grand Banks cod fishery to less than 1% of its historic levels required a complete moratorium by Canada in 1992 and China has enforced a zero-growth policy in its wild catch since 2000, redirecting its industry towards aquaculture; its annual months-long bans on fishing in disputed areas of the South China Sea is enforced over the protest of neighboring states.As of 2006, there were an estimated 43.5 million people involved in capturing or raising seafood, 85.5% of whom lived in Asia. About [...] were fishers and the remainder fish farmers. In 2012, total global production of fish, crustaceans, molluscs, and other aquatic animals was a record 158 million metric tons (174 million tons), of which 91.3 million metric tons (100 million tons) were caught in the wild. This is also a record if ignoring the Peruvian anchovy, whose population can vary dramatically with the El Niño cycle. The overall trend remains increasing, but due to expanding aquaculture in inland waters and mariculture in the sea rather than higher catches in the wild. The exclusive economic zones around coastal countries under the UNCLOS regime have permitted states to institute quota and other management systems over the most productive regions of the sea, accounting for around 87% of the annual harvest. The results are sometimes dramatic—the lull in fishing {{over the course of the}} First World War saw the North Sea's 1919 catch double 1913's—and sometimes much less so: two decades on, the levels of cod in the Grand Banks remain only 10% of their peak. At present, the species most frequently landed are herring, cod, anchovy, tuna, flounder, mullet, squid, and salmon. A number of these, as well as large predatory fish, remain well below historical levels.Over 3 million vessels are employed in sea fishing. Modern fishing vessels include fishing trawlers with a small crew, stern trawlers, purse seiners, long-line factory vessels, and large factory ships which are designed to stay at sea for weeks, processing and freezing great quantities of fish. The equipment used to capture the fish may be purse seines, other seines, trawls, dredges, gillnets, and long-lines. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is encouraging the development of local fisheries to provide food security to coastal communities and help alleviate poverty.As well as the wild stock, about 79 million metric tons (87 million tons) of food and non-food products were produced by sea farming in 2010, an all-time high. About six hundred species of plants and animals were cultured, some for use in seeding wild populations. The animals raised included finfish, aquatic reptiles, crustaceans, molluscs, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, sea squirts, and jellyfish. Integrated mariculture has the advantage that there is a readily-available supply of planktonic food and waste is removed naturally; in cases where the waste would otherwise be harmful, multi-species techniques can used to, e.g., feed <b>farmed</b> <b>shellfish</b> from the waste being produced by farmed salmon. Various methods are employed. Mesh enclosures for finfish can be suspended in the open seas, cages can be used in more sheltered waters, or ponds can be refreshed with water at each high tide. Shrimps can be reared in shallow ponds connected to the open sea. Ropes can be hung in water to grow algae, oysters, and mussels. Oysters can be reared on trays or in mesh tubes. Sea cucumbers can be ranched on the seabed. Captive breeding programmes have raised lobster larvae for release of juveniles into the wild resulting in an increased lobster harvest in Maine. At least 145 species of seaweed—red, green, and brown algae—are eaten worldwide, some long farmed in Japan and other Asian countries; there is great potential for additional algaculture. Few maritime flowering plants are widely used for food but one example is marsh samphire, which is eaten both raw and cooked. A major difficulty for aquaculture is the tendency towards monoculture and the associated risk of widespread disease. In the 1990s, disease wiped out China's farmed Farrer's scallop and white shrimp and required their replacement by other species. Shrimp farming has also caused the destruction of important mangrove forests throughout southeast Asia.|$|E

40|$|Abstract only. System {{approach}} is increasingly recommended as a logical framework for expert advising {{in support of}} integrated coastal zone management (ICZM). The System Approach Framework proposed by the SPICOSA project (Science and policy integration for coastal system assessment) aims at building integrated models, which seek to represent the ecological, economic and social dimensions of coastal system dynamics. Simulation models are used to explore different scenarios regarding one operational policy issue, and it is therefore required that the issue selected and {{the scope of the}} model were defined collectively by a participant group. This paper presents the environmental modelling approaches developed in two French study sites, which include the <b>shellfish</b> <b>farming</b> sector as one component.
