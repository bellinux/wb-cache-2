He was insecure and Cynthia was there to pump him up, to buttress, sort of, his weak side." ...|$|E
500|$|At the 2006 San Diego Comic-Con International, Wright {{said he was}} {{intrigued}} by the story's high concept and character. Wright also stressed that the film {{would not be a}} spoof but an action-adventure with some comedic elements and would incorporate both the Hank Pym and Scott Lang incarnations of the character. Wright said that he was looking to [...] "do a prologue where you see Pym as Ant-Man in action in the 60s, <b>in</b> <b>sort</b> of Tales to Astonish mode basically, and then the contemporary, sort of flash-forward, is Scott Lang's story, and how he comes to acquire the suit, how he crosses paths with Hank Pym, and then, in an interesting sort of Machiavellian way, teams up with him." [...] The next February, Wright said that the project was in [...] "a holding pattern" [...] while the script was being revised, and that he had been doing research for the film by studying nanotechnology. In March 2008, Wright said that the first draft of the script had been completed and he was working on the second.|$|E

Jennifer, now possessed by a demon and subsequently altered into a succubus, sets out on a bloody rampage in which she devours boys, and {{it is up to}} Needy to stop her. <b>In</b> <b>sort</b> of a reversal aspect of how puberty changes a girl's life, Jennifer must consume the blood of others once a month or she becomes weak and plain-looking. [...] "It's a meek shall inherit the Earth sort of thing. I think it's always really satisfying and cathartic to see a character that was previously bullied become super human", said Cody. Cody said the script is not a reflection of any part of her own life, but that she is more like character Needy. [...] "I would say I was more of a Needy than a Jennifer. I was never an Alpha female, and I've never gotten off with bullying other people", she said. [...] "If I had to choose, I was definitely the one being shoved, not the one shoving." ...|$|E

500|$|Brothers Glenn and Todd Kessler {{decided to}} work with Daniel Zelman because [...] "we have a third brother, but Daniel {{is kind of like}} our fourth brother that we've known for over 20 years." [...] When the Kesslers and Zelman devised the series, they did not {{specifically}} intend for Patty and Ellen to be lawyers. They wanted to explore the power structures in two strong women—feeling that the male power dynamics had been seen before—and considered a number of professions, including entertainment and pharmaceuticals, before deciding on law. Zelman said that the writers' main motivation to write about the law [...] "was our interest in power dynamics, the dynamics of power in society. We're very much interested in the ambiguity of it. We're just interested in seeing how far we can push these characters." [...] According to Kessler, [...] "One thing that's crucial is that Patty Hewes is {{on one end of the}} spectrum and Ellen Parsons is on the other." [...] The relationship the writers were most interested in showing was that between a mentor and a mentee, which is represented by Patty and her protégée Ellen. Todd Kessler called the real life Enron case [...] "a big part" [...] of the inspiration for Patty's main case involving Arthur Frobisher, though Zelman claims that Enron was not used as a basis in particular: [...] "It was more just the culture of all those corporate scandals at the time. There seemed to be one after the other of them, and we became very interested <b>in</b> <b>sort</b> of the characters who were a part of those scandals." ...|$|E

[...] "You don't want {{the game to}} hinge on that play, but you never know," [...] Blackwood said. [...] "I could have taken the ball up the sideline. That's a 14-point swing." [...] However, other Dolphins were not convinced. [...] "We were dominated {{to the point where}} one play didn't make much of a difference," [...] said Dolphins coach Don Shula. [...] "Our major objective was to contain Montana, and we did a terrible, terrible job of it," [...] added defensive coach Chuck Studley. Even Reggie Roby, who averaged only 39.3 yards per punt and didn't place any of his 6 punts inside the 20, took some responsibility for the loss. [...] "I was trying to kill the ball, and I kicked it bad," [...] he said. [...] "I didn't hit one well. I was scared – scared to make a mistake. It was the worst game of my life, counting high school, college, counting everything." [...] Meanwhile, in the 49ers' locker room, Joe Montana had his own explanation for the win. [...] "As far as my own game, well, I'd have to admit it was pretty close to the best I've ever played. I didn't throw anything I didn't have confidence in. We got <b>in</b> <b>sort</b> of a groove.

60|$|A similar remark {{might be}} {{sufficient}} for the bold and blank assertion (No. 7) with which the extract concludes; but that I feel some curiosity to discover what meaning the author attaches to the term analogy. Analogy implies a difference <b>in</b> <b>sort,</b> and not merely in degree; {{and it is the}} sameness of the end, with the difference of the means, which constitutes analogy. No one would say the lungs of a man were analogous to the lungs of a monkey, but any one might say that the gills of fish and the spiracula of insects are analogous to lungs. Now if there be any philosophers who have asserted that electricity as electricity is the same as Life, for that reason they cannot be analogous to each other; and as no man in his senses, philosopher or not, is capable of imagining that the lightning which destroys a sheep, was a means to the same end with the principle of its organization; for this reason, too, the two powers cannot be represented as analogous. Indeed I know of no system in which the word, as thus applied, would admit of an endurable meaning, but that which teaches us, that a mass of marrow in the skull is analogous to the rational soul, which Plato and Bacon, equally with the “poor Indian,” believe themselves to have received from the Supreme Reason.|$|E
60|$|If {{the half-hour}} between Leghorn and Pisa had been spent in any less lovely transit, I {{should still be}} grieving {{for the loss of}} the thirty minutes which might so much better have been given to either place.

We had the company, great part of the way, of more stone-pines than we had seen even between Naples and Rome, here gathering into thick woods, with the light beautiful beneath the spread of their horizontal boughs, there grouped in classic groves, and yonder straying off in twos and threes. We had the canal that of old time made Pisa a port of the Mediterranean, with Leghorn for her servant on the shore (or, if it was not this canal, it was another as straight and long), with a peasant walking beside it, under a light-green umbrella, in the showers which threatened our start but spared our arrival. We had then the city, with its domes and towers, grown full height out of the plain through which the Arno curves in the stateliest crescent of all its course.|$|E

She is your fortunate rival's magnificent widowed sister, and has come here I presume to endeavour to set matters right. Whether she will succeed may be doubtful. She is the exact ditto of her brother, who of all human beings gives himself the finest airs. But Cecilia since her separation has given herself airs too, and now leads her lonely life with her nose high among the stars. Poor dear Cecilia! her misfortunes do not become her, and I think they have hardly been deserved. They are all the result of your bitter vengeance, and though I must say that she <b>in</b> <b>sort</b> deserves it, I think that you might have spared her. After all she has done you no harm. Consider where you would be with Cecilia Holt for your wife and guardian. Hard though you are, I do not think you would have been hard enough to treat her as he has done. Indeed there is an audacity about his conduct to which I know no parallel. Fancy a man marrying a wife and then instantly bidding her go home to her mother because he finds that she once liked another man better than himself! I wonder whether the law couldn't touch him! But you have escaped from all that, and I really can't understand why you should be so awfully cruel to the poor girl." [...] Then she signed herself [...] "Yours always, F. A."

Each diligently bends [...] Towards common thoughts and things for very fear; [...] Striving their ghastly malady to cheer, [...] By thinking it {{a thing of}} yes and no, [...] That housewives talk of. But the spirit-blow [...] Was struck, and all were dreamers. At the last [...] Endymion said: [...] "Are not our fates all cast? [...] 910 [...] Why stand we here? Adieu, ye tender pair!

Pained and hot [...] His eyes went after them, until they got [...] Near to a cypress grove, whose deadly maw, [...] In one swift moment, would what then he saw [...] Engulph for ever. [...] "Stay!"

Then up he rose, [...] And, slowly as that very river flows, [...] Walk'd towards the temple grove with this lament: [...] "Why such a golden eve? The breeze is sent [...] Careful and soft, that not a leaf may fall [...] Before the serene father of them all [...] Bows down his summer head below the west. [...] Now am I of breath, speech, and speed possest, [...] 940 [...] But at the setting I must bid adieu [...] To her for the last time. Night will strew [...] On the damp grass myriads of lingering leaves, [...] And with them shall I die; nor much it grieves [...] To die, when summer dies on the cold sward. [...] Why, I have been a butterfly, a lord [...] Of flowers, garlands, love-knots, silly posies, [...] Groves, meadows, melodies, and arbour roses; [...] My kingdom's at its death, and just it is [...] That I should die with it: so in all this [...] 950 [...] We miscal grief, bale, sorrow, heartbreak, woe, [...] What is there to plain of?

[...] He saw not the two maidens, nor their smiles, [...] Wan as primroses gather'd at midnight [...] By chilly finger'd spring. [...] "Unhappy wight! [...] 980 [...] Endymion!" [...] said Peona, [...] "we are here! [...] What wouldst thou ere we all are laid on bier?" [...] Then he embrac'd her, and his lady's hand [...] Press'd, saying: [...] "Sister, I would have command, [...] If it were heaven's will, on our sad fate." [...] At which that dark-eyed stranger stood elate [...] And said, in a new voice, but sweet as love, [...] To Endymion's amaze: [...] "By Cupid's dove, [...] And so thou shalt! and by the lily truth [...] Of my own breast thou shalt, beloved youth!" [...] 990 [...] And as she spake, into her face there came [...] Light, as reflected from a silver flame: [...] Her long black hair swell'd ampler, in display [...] Full golden; in her eyes a brighter day [...] Dawn'd blue and full of love.
