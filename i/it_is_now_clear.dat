5|$|Despite {{reports that}} a {{prototype}} began taxiing tests on 30 June 1948, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> that no prototype was actually built and that only manufacturing of the tailplane may have begun.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> {{that the}} common {{ancestor}} of the bony fishes (Osteichthyes) had a primitive air-breathing lung—later evolved into a swim bladder in most actinopterygians (ray-finned fishes). This suggests that crossopterygians evolved in warm shallow waters, using their simple lung when the oxygen level in the water became too low.|$|E
5|$|The {{two main}} {{parts of the}} wreck of Titanic present a {{striking}} contrast. Although fourteen survivors testified that the ship had broken apart as she sank, this testimony was discounted by the official inquiries, and it was supposed that the ship had sunk intact. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> that the stresses on Titanic caused the ship to split apart between {{the second and third}} funnels at or just below the surface.|$|E
60|$|At length {{we reached}} the suburbs of Chicago, and rolled {{down one of the}} broad avenues. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> and bright, and the clean broad street with its {{handsome}} houses pleased me very much.|$|R
50|$|So, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> that pituri <b>is</b> not one {{substance}} and the term {{relates to the}} chewing of the leaves of various plants including Duboisia hopwoodii {{and more than one}} species of the native tobacco genus Nicotiana.|$|R
50|$|On 27 November 1987, Tomba scored {{his first}} World Cup victory, in a slalom at Sestriere, Italy. Two {{days later he}} won the giant slalom, beating his idol, Ingemar Stenmark. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> that Tomba <b>was</b> {{a force to be}} {{reckoned}} with within the alpine skiing world.|$|R
5|$|Genetic {{analysis}} performed since the 1990s has extended {{the understanding of}} the relationship between different organisms. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> the brachiopods do not belong to the Deuterostomata (such as echinoderms and chordates) as was hypothesized earlier, but {{should be included in the}} Protostomia (with mollusks and annelid worms), in a subgroup now called Lophotrochozoa. Although their adult morphology seems rather different, the nucleotid sequence of the 18S rRNA indicates that the horseshoe worms are the closest relatives of the inarticulate brachiopods rather than articulate brachiopods. For now, the weight of evidence is inconclusive as to the exact relations within the inarticulates. Consequently, it has been suggested to included horseshoe worms in the Brachiopoda as a class named Phoronata B.L.Cohen in addition to the Craniata and Lingulata, within the subphylum Linguliformea. The other subphylum Rhynchonelliformea only contains one class, which is subdivided in the orders Rhynchonellida, Terebratulida and Thecideida.|$|E
25|$|The {{history and}} {{identity}} of Tell Arbid have been {{emerging as the}} result of recent excavations. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> that the most prosperous period for the ancient Arbid was the IIIrd millennium B.C.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> {{that the}} term prostate-{{specific}} antigen is a misnomer: it is an antigen but is not specific to the prostate. Although present in large amounts in prostatic tissue and semen, it has been detected in other body fluids and tissues.|$|E
5000|$|On 11 July 1944, Roger Mais published, [...] "Now we Know", a {{stinging}} denunciation of British colonialism in Public Opinion, {{in which he}} explained that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> that World War 2 was not a fight for freedom but a war to preserve imperial privilege and exploitation: ...|$|R
60|$|Douglas, without replying, {{called a}} cab. Marmaduke's loud {{conversation}} was irksome in the street, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> that he <b>was</b> unusually excited. At the museum they alighted, and {{passed through the}} courts into the grill-room, where they sat down together at a vacant table, and ordered luncheon.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> sunrise. Soon {{the crew}} {{came on board}} in twos and threes; the riggers bestirred themselves; the mates were {{actively}} engaged; {{and several of the}} shore people were busy in bringing various last things on board. Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained invisibly enshrined within his cabin.|$|R
25|$|In Capitalism and Slavery, Eric Williams {{argued that}} the declining economies of the British West Indies led to the {{abolition}} of the slave trade and of slavery. More recent research has rejected this conclusion; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> that the colonies of the British Caribbean profited considerably during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.|$|E
25|$|Bilateral {{oophorectomy}} {{has been}} traditionally {{done in the}} belief that the benefit of preventing ovarian cancer would outweigh the risks associated with removal of ovaries. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> that prophylactic oophorectomy without a reasonable medical indication decreases long-term survival rates substantially and has deleterious long-term effects on health and well-being even in post-menopausal women.|$|E
25|$|Cook did {{not lose}} a single man to scurvy, and his report came down in favour of malt and wort, {{although}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> {{that the reason for}} the health of his crews on this and other voyages was Cook's regime of shipboard cleanliness, enforced by strict discipline, as well as frequent replenishment of fresh food and green stuffs. Another rule implemented by Cook was his prohibition of the consumption of salt fat skimmed from the ship's copper boiling pans, then a common practice in the Navy. In contact with air the copper formed compounds that prevented the absorption of vitamins by the intestines.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> {{revealed}} that Cogliostro was born as Cain, the first murderer, {{and since the}} beginning he wanted to rule Hell rather than serve <b>it.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> {{that the only reason}} Cogliostro helped Spawn was to enable him to gain the throne of Hell, making him the new ruler.|$|R
50|$|Richardson {{was born}} at Capenhurst Hall in Cheshire. He was educated in England and France. His father, Richard, {{died when he was}} six. Despite an early {{sporting}} talent for cricket, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> that he would need to make his own living and so, encouraged by his mother, he followed his other talent for engineering.|$|R
25|$|At Orgreave {{the union}} failed {{to stop the}} {{movement}} of lorries. Furthermore, the violence <b>was</b> costing <b>it</b> public support. A Gallup poll showed 79% disapproval of NUM methods. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> {{that the government had}} the equipment, the forces, the organization, and the will to prevail against pickets. The number of miners at work grew to 53,000 by late June.|$|R
25|$|Since their {{discovery}} in 1873 {{there has been}} considerable debate about their origin. Three theories were dominant: from 1949 to 1970 the connective tissue origin was popular, which stated that osteoclasts and osteoblasts are of the same lineage, and osteoblasts fuse together to form osteoclasts. After years of controversy <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> that these cells develop from the self fusion of macrophages. It was {{in the beginning of}} 1980 that the monocyte phagocytic system was recognized as precursor of osteoclasts. Osteoclast formation requires the presence of RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor κβ ligand) and M-CSF (Macrophage colony-stimulating factor). These membrane-bound proteins are produced by neighbouring stromal cells and osteoblasts, thus requiring direct contact between these cells and osteoclast precursors.|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt and Henry Morgenthau {{insisted that}} the Big Four (United States, United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China) {{participate}} in the Bretton Woods conference in 1944, but their goal was frustrated when the Soviet Union would not join the IMF. In the past, {{the reasons why the}} Soviet Union chose not to subscribe to the articles by December 1945 {{have been the subject of}} speculation. But since the release of relevant Soviet archives, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> that the Soviet calculation was based on the behavior of the parties that had actually expressed their assent to the Bretton Woods Agreements. The extended debates about ratification that had taken place both in the UK and the U.S. were read in Moscow as evidence of the quick disintegration of the wartime alliance.|$|E
500|$|Before {{recognition}} of E. cinnabarina as a species, E. lewisii was interpreted {{to be the}} sister of E. cardinalis. [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> that E. cinnabarina and E. cardinalis are sister species and that E. lewisii and E. erubescens are sister species. [...] In the hypothesized phylogeny, the 'cinnabarina/cardinalis' pair is sister to the 'lewisii/erubescens' pair.|$|E
40|$|The {{acquired}} {{doses of}} Antarctic meteorites for dating of terrestrial ages were {{measured by the}} thermoluminescence (TL) intensity of fusion crust. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clearer</b> that there <b>is</b> a significant correlation between the acquired dose and terrestrial age, which was previously measured by cosmogenic radionuclide abundance. Also, the ^ Cl method by accelerator mass spectrometry seems to provide a large terrestrial age occasionally...|$|R
50|$|The {{director}} of the French branch of Tobis, Dr Henckel, had given Clair complete freedom to make the film, but after the Paris opening he told Clair that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> what others thought of his methods, and that in future {{he would have to}} resign himself to giving the audience what they wanted - talking pictures that really talked.|$|R
50|$|Under Schoonees’s {{guidance}} {{the first}} part of the dictionary (A—C) was published in 1951, the second part (D—F) in 1955 and the third part (G) in 1957. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> that dictionary could progress, but at the same <b>it</b> <b>was</b> equally clear that in spite of a sizeable expansion of the editorial team it would prove impossible to complete such a comprehensive work within a couple of years.|$|R
500|$|In 1998, {{following}} large-scale frog {{deaths in}} Australia and Central America, research teams in both areas {{came up with}} identical results: a previously undescribed species of pathogenic fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> that many recent extinctions of amphibians in Australia and the Americas are linked to this fungus. [...] This fungus belongs to a family of saprobes known as chytrids that are not generally pathogenic.|$|E
500|$|Brand himself came {{to believe}} that the {{proposal}} had been designed to drive a wedge between the Allies. Two months before his death in 1964, at the trial in Germany of Eichmann's deputies [...] and , he said he had [...] "made a terrible mistake in passing this on to the British. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> to me that Himmler sought to sow suspicion among the Allies as a preparation for his much desired Nazi-Western coalition against Moscow." ...|$|E
2500|$|The two-component vector ξ is {{acted upon}} by SL(2,C) {{in a manner}} {{compatible}} with (...) [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> that the kernel of the representation of SL(2,C) on hermitian matrices is {±I}.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> that Tāufaʻāhau <b>was</b> very {{ambitious and}} {{wanted more than}} only Haʻapai. To stop him, in 1827, the chiefs of Tongatapu made Laufilitonga the Tuʻi Tonga, and made Tāufa's uncle Aleamotuʻa a Tuʻi Kanokupolu, {{preventing}} an island invasion, as fighting against family members {{was seen as a}} Tongan disgrace. In spite of this, at his baptism in 1831, Tāufa declared himself King George of Tonga.|$|R
5000|$|On November 30, the State Board of Elections {{ordered a}} recount of the Durham County votes. [...] The recount {{was to be}} {{completed}} by 7 p.m. on December 5. However, by that morning, early results showed no change in the tally. Bowing to the inevitable, McCrory announced on his campaign's YouTube channel that he was conceding the race to Cooper, saying that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> that [...] "the majority of our citizens had spoken." ...|$|R
60|$|Unless some means {{could be}} found to stop him <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> to Stella that Mr. Layard meant to propose to her, and as she had not the {{slightest}} intention of accepting him this was an honour which she did not seek. But she could find no sufficient means; hints, and even snubs, only seemed to add fuel to the fire, and of a perpetual game of hide and seek she grew weary.|$|R
2500|$|Long {{after the}} war, Brand commented: [...] "I {{made a terrible}} mistake in passing this on to the British. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> to me that Himmler sought to sow {{suspicion}} among the Allies as a preparation for his much desired Nazi-Western coalition against Moscow." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 1957 – Tigran Shmaonov {{reports that}} [...] "the {{absolute}} effective {{temperature of the}} radioemission background ... is 4±3K". It is noted that the [...] "measurements showed that radiation intensity was independent of either time or direction of observation ... <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> that Shmaonov did observe {{the cosmic microwave background}} at a wavelength of 3.2cm" ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 18th century [...] [...] [...] {{given the}} then-prevailing {{dramatic}} {{differences between the}} property rights of the husband and the far lesser rights of the wife, only {{the consent of the}} husband would matter. Whether [...] "the master of the house" [...] consented or objected, his decision would control. Thus, if [...] "original understanding" [...] were to govern the outcome of this case, the search was clearly invalid because the husband did not consent. History, however, is not dispositive, because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear,</b> as a matter of constitutional law, that the male and the female are equal partners.|$|E
50|$|As freight volumes {{continued}} {{to decrease the}} viability of the branch came into question, particularly as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> the connection with the Bay of Plenty would never be made. In 1952 a Royal Commission was appointed to look into the profitability of branch lines, including the Moutohora branch. The Commission sanctioned the retention of the branch for the time being, but made it clear to the local citizens that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a case of 'use it or lose it'.|$|R
2500|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> to Abu Zakariya {{that the}} Portuguese had no {{intention}} to yield Ceuta, that nothing remained to do with Ferdinand but to extract the largest cash ransom that he could get. But nothing came of this. [...] After fifteen months of captivity in the worst conditions yet, Ferdinand died on June 5, 1443, aged 41. [...] Several of the remaining members of Ferdinand's entourage, including the secretary Frei João Álvares, were eventually ransomed back to Portugal in subsequent years.|$|R
2500|$|The Goschen-Bethmann Hollweg meeting {{did much}} to {{galvanize}} the British government into deciding to ally with France and Russia. Sir Eyre Crowe commented that Germany had [...] "made up her mind" [...] to go to war. Germany's policy was to reveal to Britain her war aims in hope that a statement might be reached that would ensure British neutrality. Instead, Bethmann Hollweg's move had the opposite effect, since <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> to London that Germany {{had no interest in}} peace.|$|R
