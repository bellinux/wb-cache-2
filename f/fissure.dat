40|$|Surface mining-induced <b>fissures</b> {{formed in}} shallow coal seam mining have serious impact on safety mining and water {{resources}} protection. This paper proposes {{a novel approach}} to study the formation mechanism and dynamic development of surface mining-induced <b>fissures</b> in shallow coal seam mining. This approach combines field tests, theoretical analysis, and numerical simulations based on the geological condition of shallow coal seam mining in Chuancao Gedan Coal Mine. Two typical surface mining-induced <b>fissures,</b> step-type <b>fissures</b> and collapse-type <b>fissures,</b> are generated in shallow coal seam mining. The <b>fissures</b> with large vertical throw or horizontal opening severely impact water resource protection and surface ecological environment. Surface mining-induced <b>fissures</b> are generated periodically and changed dynamically with the advancing of working face. The vertical throw and horizontal opening of surface <b>fissures</b> are changed dynamically with the movement of loading key strata. The movement forms of loading key strata determine the morphological development of surface <b>fissures.</b> Downward sliding movement of broken rocks causes step-type <b>fissures,</b> while downward rotation movement leads to collapse-type <b>fissures.</b> The degree of the downward sliding and rotation of broken rocks determines the vertical throw and horizontal opening of surface <b>fissures.</b> This paper proposes mining technologies to reduce damaging ground <b>fissures</b> in shallow coal seam mining and analyzes their control effects...|$|R
30|$|According to the {{prediction}} results of ground <b>fissures</b> and water-conducted <b>fissures,</b> in those regions on the ground where: (1) the wide ground <b>fissures</b> and (2) the high water-conducted <b>fissures</b> may develop, should be filled in time when observed (for example, by Bulldozer rolling) to avoid air leakage and water inrush.|$|R
30|$|However, in {{both the}} west and the east sides of the panel, as well as partial area of the middle part, the water-conducted <b>fissures</b> are {{strongly}} developed with great height. This also means the water-conducted <b>fissures</b> completely go through the Neogene aquifuge, and connect to the Quaternary aquifer. Therefore, in this case, the ground water can infiltrate into the mine via the water-conducted <b>fissures.</b> In addition, part of these water-conducted <b>fissures</b> connects to the ground <b>fissures.</b> The air pressure along the water-conducted <b>fissures</b> will probably cause the air leakage, and bring potential damage to the mining safety.|$|R
5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} {{the crew of the}} Federation {{starship}} Enterprise. In this episode, Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn) returns from a bat'leth tournament and slowly discovers that he is being moved across parallel universes. The crew of an alternative Enterprise realise what is happening and seek to return him to his own reality, but, after an attack by a Bajoran ship, a space-time <b>fissure</b> explodes, causing hundreds of thousands of alternative versions of the Enterprise to enter the same universe. After Worf reverses the course through the <b>fissure,</b> he and all the versions of the Enterprise are returned to their respective universes.|$|E
5|$|The right lung {{has both}} more lobes and {{segments}} than the left. It {{is divided into}} three lobes, an upper, middle, and a lower, by two fissures, one oblique and one horizontal. The upper, horizontal <b>fissure,</b> separates the upper from the middle lobe. It begins in the lower oblique <b>fissure</b> near the posterior border of the lung, and, running horizontally forward, cuts the anterior border on a level with the sternal end of the fourth costal cartilage; on the mediastinal surface it may be traced backward to the hilum.|$|E
5|$|Upon investigation, {{the crew}} find that Worf's RNA has an unusual quantum {{signature}} and confirm {{that he is}} from a different universe. The crew theorizes that Worf, on his original return from the bat'leth tournament, passed through a time-space <b>fissure,</b> with the shuttlecraft's engines causing Worf to quantum flux between several parallel universes. Data determines that Worf's proximity to La Forge's VISOR caused Worf to shift between universes, and that each universe covers a different possibility. In effect, anything that could possibly happen has done so in a parallel universe, hence the believable changes in the reality that Worf is experiencing. The Enterprise returns {{to the location of}} the <b>fissure,</b> attempting to return Worf to his original universe. The Enterprise is then attacked by a Bajoran ship, which causes the <b>fissure</b> to destabilize and the various realities to merge, resulting in over 285,000 versions of the Enterprise appearing in the same area of space.|$|E
30|$|The major {{differences}} between the open and the open–closed <b>fissures</b> are: (1) the position of fissures’ distribution, (2) the form of <b>fissures,</b> and (3) whether the <b>fissures</b> will be closed after their production.|$|R

5|$|At 07:15 UTC on 14 November 1963, {{the cook}} of Ísleifur II, a trawler sailing these same waters spotted a rising column of dark smoke {{southwest}} of the boat. The captain thought {{it might have been}} a boat on fire, and ordered the vessel to investigate. Instead, they encountered explosive eruptions giving off black columns of ash, indicating that a volcanic eruption had begun to penetrate the surface of the sea. By 11:00 the same day, the eruption column had reached several kilometres in height. At first the eruptions took place at three separate vents along a northeast by southwest trending <b>fissure,</b> but by the afternoon the separate eruption columns had merged into one along the erupting <b>fissure.</b> Over the next week, explosions were continuous, and after just a few days the new island, formed mainly of scoria, measured over 500metres (1640ft) in length and had reached a height of 45metres (147ft).|$|E

40|$|Introduction. <b>Fissured</b> {{tongue is}} a {{commonly}} encountered tongue disorder in dental practice. But {{there is a}} lack of data on different pattern, severity, and association of <b>fissuring</b> with various systemic disorders and other tongue anomalies. This study attempts to establish a classification system for <b>fissured</b> tongue and to know the correlation with the systemic health and other disorders of the tongue. Materials and Methods. A total of 1000 subjects between the age groups of 10 and 80 years were included in the study. Pattern of <b>fissuring,</b> allied systemic diseases, and related tongue anomalies were tabulated. Results. Out of 1000 subjects, 387 subjects presented with <b>fissured</b> tongue. Out of 387 subjects, hypertension was present in 57 cases, 18 subjects had diabetes, and 3 subjects had both hypertension and diabetes. Central longitudinal type was found to be the most common type of tongue <b>fissuring.</b> Conclusion. <b>Fissured</b> tongue has been found to be associated with certain systemic disease and further researches are required to know positive correlation. If a correlation exists, such disorders could be diagnosed earlier by identifying <b>fissured</b> tongue at an earlier age...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:Previous studies {{demonstrated}} that carotid plaques analyzed by CTA can show contrast plaque enhancement. The {{purpose of this}} preliminary work was to evaluate the possible association between the <b>fissured</b> fibrous cap and contrast plaque enhancement. MATERIALS AND METHODS:Forty-seven consecutive (men = 25; average age = 66. 8 ± 9 years) symptomatic patients studied by use of a multidetector row CT scanner were prospectively analyzed. CTA was performed before and after contrast and radiation doses were recorded; analysis of contrast plaque enhancement was performed. Patients underwent carotid endarterectomy en bloc; histologic sections were prepared and evaluated for <b>fissured</b> fibrous cap and microvessel attenuation. The Mann-Whitney test was performed to evaluate {{the differences between the}} 2 groups. A multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the effect of <b>fissured</b> fibrous cap and microvessel attenuation on contrast plaque enhancement. Receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the curve were also calculated. RESULTS:Twelve patients had <b>fissured</b> fibrous cap. In 92 % (11 / 12) of <b>fissured</b> fibrous cap-positive plaques, we found contrast plaque enhancement, whereas in 69 % (24 / 35) of the plaques without <b>fissured</b> fibrous cap contrast plaque enhancement was found. The Mann-Whitney test showed a statistically significant difference between the contrast enhancement in plaques with <b>fissured</b> fibrous cap (Hounsfield units = 22. 6) and without <b>fissured</b> fibrous cap (Hounsfield units = 12. 9) (P =. 011). On the regression analysis, both <b>fissured</b> fibrous cap and neovascularization were associated with contrast plaque enhancement (P =. 0366 and P =. 0001). The receiver operating characteristic curve confirmed an association between <b>fissured</b> fibrous cap and contrast plaque enhancement with an area under the curve of 0. 749 (P =. 005). CONCLUSIONS:The presence of <b>fissured</b> fibrous cap is associated with contrast plaque enhancement. Histologic analysis showed that the presence of <b>fissured</b> fibrous cap is associated with a larger contrast plaque enhancement compared with the contrast plaque enhancement of plaques without <b>fissured</b> fibrous cap...|$|R
30|$|The other {{category}} is the open–closed <b>fissures,</b> which curvedly distribute directly above {{and in front}} of the working face. This type of ground <b>fissures</b> extends in the direction that is approximately perpendicular to the direction of the advancing working face.

Lagrivea was a large tree squirrel with flat lower incisors and a large, triangular fourth lower premolar (p4). Each of the four cheekteeth (p4 and three molars, m1 through m3) bears a deep basin {{in the middle of}} the crown. The m3 is about rectangular in shape, but rounded at the back.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{automatic}} segmentation of pulmonary lobes from computed tomography (CT) scans is presented that is robust against incomplete <b>fissures.</b> The method {{is based on}} a multiatlas approach in which existing lobar segmentations are deformed to test scans in which the <b>fissures,</b> the lungs, and the bronchial tree have been automatically segmented. The key element of our method is a cost function that exploits information from <b>fissures,</b> lung borders, and bronchial tree in an effective way, such that less reliable information (lungs, airways) is only used when the most reliable information (<b>fissures)</b> is missing. To cope with the anatomical variation in lobe shape, an atlas selection mechanism is introduced. The method is evaluated on two test sets of 120 scans in total. The results show that the lobe segmentation closely follows the <b>fissures</b> when they are present. In a simulated experiment in which parts of complete <b>fissures</b> are removed, the robustness of the method against different levels of incomplete <b>fissures</b> is shown. When the <b>fissures</b> are incomplete, an observer study shows agreement of the automatically determined lobe borders with a radiologist for 81 % of the lobe borders on average. © 2006 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|Fiber surface morphologies and {{associated}} internal structures {{are closely related}} to its properties. Unlike other fibers including cotton, bast fibers possess transverse nodes and <b>fissures</b> in cross-sectional and longitudinal directions. Their morphologies {{and associated}} internal structures were anatomically examined under the scanning electron microscope. The results showed that the morphologies of the nodes and the <b>fissures</b> of bast fibers varied depending on the construction of the inner fibril cellular layers. The transverse nodes and <b>fissures</b> were formed by the folding and spiralling of the cellular layers during plant growth. The dimensions of nodes and <b>fissures</b> were determined by the dislocations of the cellular layers. There were also many longitudinal <b>fissures</b> in bast fibers. Some deep longitudinal <b>fissures</b> even opened the fiber lumen for a short way along the fiber. In addition, the lumen channel of the bast fibers could be disturbed or disrupted by the nodes and the spirals of the internal cellular layers. The existence of the transverse nodes and <b>fissures</b> in the bast fibers could degrade the fiber mechanical properties, whereas the longitudinal <b>fissures</b> may contribute to the very rapid moisture absorption and desorption. <br /...|$|R
30|$|If the water-conducted <b>fissures</b> {{completely}} {{go through}} the overlying aquifuge, then the water contained in the aquifer will most likely flow into the mined-out area. Furthermore, this will increase the inflow, and even lead the roof water inrush.

5|$|As the eruptions continued, {{they became}} {{concentrated}} at one vent along the <b>fissure</b> {{and began to}} build the island into a more circular shape. By 24 November, the island measured about 900metres by 650metres (2950 by 2130ft). The violent explosions caused by the meeting of lava and sea water meant that the island consisted of a loose pile of volcanic rock (scoria), which was eroded rapidly by North Atlantic storms during the winter. However, eruptions more than kept pace with wave erosion, and by February 1964, the island had a maximum diameter of over 1300metres (4265ft).|$|E

30|$|According to the {{distribution}} of the ground <b>fissures,</b> we found that: (1) {{in the beginning of the}} mining process, the impact of underground mining on the deformation of ground surface is quite little, and cannot lead to the forming of ground fissures; (2) the ground <b>fissures</b> begin to occur when mining to the position of 120  m; and in the subsequent steps of mining, the ground <b>fissures</b> periodically expand along both the two directions that are parallel to and perpendicular to the direction of mining; (3) finally the open <b>fissures</b> are oval-shaped distributed around the boundary of the mining area, while the open–closed <b>fissures</b> are mainly distributed above the mined-out area.|$|R
