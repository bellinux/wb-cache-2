5|$|The site {{is at the}} top of a Carboniferous Limestone ridge on the {{northern}} edge of the Mendip Hills. It forms part of the Black Down Pericline where the limestone <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> because of erosion of the overlying Triassic Dolomitic Conglomerate. The soil depth varies considerably, owing to the slope within the site and the effects of its exposure to the wind.|$|E
5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum largely reproduces asexually by {{branching}} {{rather than}} sexually through spores. While wind-blown spores {{can result in}} sexual reproduction for the species, most spores probably fall within a relatively short radius of the plant. In addition, reproduction through spore dispersal requires the spore to land in suitable conditions for generating a gametophyte, typically in bright sunlight on thin serpentine soils. These requirements allow A.viridimontanum to colonize recently disturbed sites on ultramafic outcrops, where bedrock <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> and competing plants have been removed. The populations appear stable, with the long life of individuals compensating for low recruitment rates.|$|E

The synthetic isotope lutetium-177 bound to octreotate (a somatostatin analogue), is used experimentally in targeted radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumors. Indeed, lutetium-177 is seeing increasing use as a radionuclide, in neuroendrocine tumor therapy and bone pain palliation.|$|E

5|$|Exposure may not {{be evident}} for eight hours for 50% HF, rising to 24 hours for lower concentrations, and a burn may {{initially}} be painless as hydrogen fluoride affects nerve function. If skin <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> to HF, damage can be reduced by rinsing it under a jet of water for 10–15 minutes and removing contaminated clothing. Calcium gluconate is often applied next, providing calcium ions to bind with fluoride; skin burns can be treated with 2.5% calcium gluconate gel or special rinsing solutions. Hydrofluoric acid absorption requires further medical treatment; calcium gluconate may be injected or administered intravenously. Using calcium chloride – a common laboratory reagent – in lieu of calcium gluconate is contraindicated, and may lead to severe complications. Excision or amputation of affected parts may be required.|$|E
5|$|The rock of Siletzia <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> {{in various}} places by tectonic uplift (as around the {{periphery}} of the Olympic Mountains), anticlinal folding (such as the Black Hills and Willapa Hills in southwestern Washington), and overthrusting onto other formations (along various faults in central and southern Oregon).

(See map. The Grays River Volcanics of Washington and Tillamook Volcanics of Oregon are now considered post-Siletz.) Elsewhere Siletzia is covered by younger volcanic and sedimentary deposits.|$|E

40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{planned for the}} purpose of {{determining}} the effect of exposure to violence during pregnancy on self-esteem. Material and Methods: A comparative and descriptive study which is conducted on 164 pregnant women with 26 women exposed to violence during pregnancy and 138 women without exposure. Data were collected with the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory. Chi square, Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests were used in the analysis of the data. Results: Women’s mean age in the study was 26. 35 ± 5. 10. Of the women 16 % reported that they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> to any type of violence during pregnancy, of these women 69 % <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> violence by their husband. It was determined that there was no statistically significant difference regarding age, occupation and educational level among two groups of women. It was determined that women who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> violence during pregnancy had more incidence of abortions. The mean of self-esteem scale was 36. 91 ± 2. 65 for women who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> to violence, 38. 71 ± 3. 59 for women who <b>had</b> not <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> to violence (p= 0. 003).
