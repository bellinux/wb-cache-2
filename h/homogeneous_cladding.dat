50|$|In {{an optical}} fiber, the {{normalized}} frequency, V (also called the V number), is given bywhere a {{is the core}} radius, &lambda; is the wavelength in vacuum, n1 is the maximum refractive index of the core, n2 is the refractive index of the <b>homogeneous</b> <b>cladding,</b> and applying the usual definition of the numerical aperture NA.|$|E
5000|$|Refractive index contrast, in {{an optical}} fiber, {{is a measure}} of the {{relative}} difference in refractive index of the core and cladding. The refractive index contrast of an optical fibre, Δ, is typically given by Δ = (n12- n22)/(2n12), where n1 is the maximum refractive index in the core and n2 is the refractive index of the <b>homogeneous</b> <b>cladding.</b> Normal optical fibers have very low refractive index contrast(Δ<<1)hence are weakly guided medium. The weak guiding will cause more of the Electrical field to [...] "leak" [...] and travel through the cladding(as evanescent waves) as compared to the strongly guided waveguides.|$|E
40|$|The {{propagation}} of optical fields in a cylindrical fiber of smectic B liquid crystal with banana-shaped molecules is studied. We consider a cylinder of banana-smectic liquid crystal whose tilt angle {{is assumed to}} be uniform, surrounded by an infinite <b>homogeneous</b> isotropic <b>cladding.</b> We perform an analytic description of the optical field propagation within the guide for Transverse Magnetic modes (TM) for a low intensity optical beam. We take into account the coupling between the optical field and the orientational configuration of the smectic. Eikonal equations are derived and ray trajectories are analyzed in their corresponding Hamiltonian representation, in the optical limit. Finally, by solving Maxwell’s equations analytically, we obtain the electromagnetic modes and the spatial electromagnetic energy distribution within the guide...|$|R
40|$|Recently, it {{was shown}} that an {{infinite}} perfectly conducting (PEC) cylinder can be nearly perfectly cloaked from normally incident electromagnetic waves using a single-layer <b>homogeneous</b> dielectric <b>cladding.</b> Here we study the electromagnetic response of such structures with the goal to understand the main mechanisms underpinning this cloaking phenomenon. We introduce a simple model of the cloaked PEC cylinder, replacing it by an omnidirectional electric-line scatterer and a bipolar magnetic one; accordingly, the far field is determined in a compact closed form. The analysis of the results shows that the optimal cloaking regime corresponds to the frequency point where the total electric moment is drastically mitigated and thus the radiation pattern of the device resembles that of a magnetic-dipole line. In {{the vicinity of the}} optimal cloaking frequency we observe the response close to that of Huygens' pairs of electric and magnetic line scatterers. Comment: 17 Pages, 18 Figures, Journa...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of the reported research project on <b>homogeneous</b> lead <b>cladding</b> by thermal plasma methods were to extend the possibilities of design and manufacture of components for chemical plant and apparatus construction and to {{enhance the quality of}} homogeneous lead claddings under automated manufacturing conditions in industry. For this purpose, comprehensive investigations were conducted with a computer-controlled plasma facility for controlling the heat transfer of the high-energy plasma. Detailed investigations of plasma fusion lead claddings on untinned steel sheet indicated that wetting can be sufficiently improved for metallurgical bonding between the surfacing material and substrate, even with the use of fine copper lead alloy with a tin content of only 2 per cent, as indicated by metallographical analysis. For this purpose, the welding parameters, such as the plasma current and welding velocity, must be optimized in combination with magnetic deflection and mechanical oscillation, as well as the necessary quantity of inert gas.
