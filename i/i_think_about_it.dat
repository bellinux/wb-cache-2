25|$|They don't respect {{our culture}} because we didn't give {{permission}} {{for someone to}} carve the sacred Black Hills where our burial grounds are. They were there for us to enjoy and they were there for us to pray. But it wasn't meant to be carved into images, which is very wrong for all of us. The more <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> the more it's a desecration of our Indian culture. Not just Crazy Horse, but all of us.|$|E

By the thirties it had certainly become degenerate... It was a hat which had lost all aspiration: it had become a mingy hat...".|$|E

500|$|Armstrong has {{discussed}} the group's status {{of being a}} punk band on a major record label, saying [...] "Sometimes I think we've become totally redundant because we're this big band now; we've {{made a lot of}} money â€“ we're not punk rock any more. But then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and just say, 'You can take us out of a punk rock environment, but you can't take the punk rock out of us.'" ...|$|E

I can always sense where he's going with things just by the mood he's in or the attitude or how the song is going. Once in a while, he throws me for a loop, but I can usually keep him where I want him." ...|$|E
500|$|Cobain {{said the}} song was {{inspired}} by documentaries about children with cancer. He told biographer Michael Azerrad, [...] "Anytime <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> it makes me sadder than anything I can think of." [...] Azerrad asserted in his biography [...] that despite Cobain's explanation, the song actually appeared to be about Courtney Love. Charles Cross wrote in his Kurt Cobain biography Heavier Than Heaven that with the lyric [...] "I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black", the frontman [...] "sang in {{what has to be}} the most convoluted route any songwriter undertook in pop history to say 'I love you'". After a performance of the song by singer Lana Del Rey in 2012, Courtney Love asserted on Twitter that the song is about her vagina. The tweets were deleted shortly after. Cobain said that the song's chorus of [...] "Hey/Wait/I've got a new complaint" [...] was him giving an example of how he was perceived by the media.|$|E

500|$|The British POWs {{provided}} the Americans with necessary advice regarding the camp life and shared rations and clothing {{sent by the}} British Red Cross. The British, {{who were in the}} process of digging an escape tunnel, requested help from the Americans. Juskalian would later describe the operation: [...] "I volunteered, although I have had claustrophobia ever since a boyhood friend shut me up in a wood bin for a prank. When I look back at it, I wonder how I did it. Some nights when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> I break out in a cold sweat. Somehow, I was able to summon up the will to do it. The tunnel was already some 80 to 100feet long. It extended underground beyond the barbed wire fence, but those in charge wanted to lengthen it so that the opening would come out below ground level on the steep side near the bank of the Fulda River. In that way when the tunnel was broken open, the escapees could not be seen by the guards in the towers." ...|$|E
500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{was also}} {{pleased with the}} episode, noting that Hermes' and Bender's team-up worked well and that the ending was cathartic. [...] He found the episode to be his {{favorite}} of the new season, giving it a 9/10 and stating, [...] "after an okay start, [...] {{turned out to be}} my favorite episode of this comeback season so far. The more <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> the more pleasure I find in it. It was an episode full of laughs, action and the kind of emotional tug the series has been missing of late." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste gave the episode a rating of 8.7/10 and wrote: [...] "Judging from this episode and the last it seems like Futurama is intentionally straying away from its old groupings and trying new things. The sixth season is moving off from the repetition of its first two episodes and is all the better for it." [...] Though he felt the episode was weaker with its jokes, he noted that this [...] "is frequently the case in with episodes that deal more with the characters and less about making jokes in a wacky world. But this isn't something I think will bother real fans, as that's part of what's given Futurama its cult audience in the first place: that the show gives a damn about its characters." ...|$|E

2500|$|Anthony Kiedis {{was asked}} in a December 2016 {{interview}} if he ever plans to retire {{and he said that}} he expects to be writing music until the day he dies. [...] "We might always be writing music, writing songs...I can't imagine that going away. I want to write a song today, tomorrow. That's quite a satisfying thing to do. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> all the time, there's so many things that I want to sing, melodies, and lyrics. So, if you have people you want to work with for a lifetime, there's no reason you can't write songs until the day you die." ...|$|E
2500|$|British {{photographer}} Mark Seager {{attempted to}} photograph the event but the mob physically assaulted him and destroyed his camera. After the event, he stated, [...] "It [...] was the most horrible thing that I have ever seen and I have reported from Congo, Kosovo, many bad places.... I know they [...] are not all like this and I'm a very forgiving person but I'll never forget this. It was murder of the most barbaric kind.

2500|$|... "It was a {{tough thing}} for me. I kicked two calls {{in the fourth quarter}} and I {{impacted}} the game and as an official you never want to do that.

I know that I did my best at that time, but it wasn't good enough. When we make mistakes, you got to step up and own them.

2500|$|Within the Government doubts quickly {{began to}} be voiced about the justice of his treatment. [...] Even his Secretary of State and the Prime Minister in 1936, Baldwin, wrote letters admitting that their {{decision}} had been wrong. As former Prime Minister, Sir Stanley Baldwin later wrote [...] "I feel it only right to say that, if I had had the full evidence before me which has now been made available, I should not have taken the decision I reluctantly did". Writing in November 1937, Lord Hankey stated [...] "the more <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> the more I feel that the punishment did not fit the crime". In December 1938, the Marquess of Londonderry â€“ the Secretary of State for Air {{at the time of}} the dismissal â€“ wrote privately to Baldwin [...] "... was most unjustly treated and was the victim of the inveterate hatred of a civil servant Sir Warren Fisher who should never have been allowed to encompass his downfall, as he undoubtedly did." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sony Pictures {{spokesman}} Steve Elzer said {{a weekend}} take of about $30 {{million in the}} United States and Canada would be a solid number for a movie {{that is not a}} branded sequel. Sony distribution chief Rory Bruer said [...] "Certainly we {{would have liked to have}} done more, but this was always going to be a worldwide play." [...] The Hollywood Reporter reported Sony insiders estimate a potential loss at about $20 million if the film does not gross high overseas, though estimates of top executives at several rival studios are much higher. On Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Will Smith admitted he was also disappointed with the box office performance and joked [...] "Here's how <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> Jimmy, let's be honest.

2500|$|The choice {{received}} generally {{positive reactions}} from Republicans and conservatives. Victor Davis Hanson stated [...] "the timing and choice were inspired", and Mark Steyn stated he was [...] "happy" [...] over the choice. Connecticut Governor M. Jodi Rell said of Palin, [...] "She is strong. She is capable. She is articulate," [...] and suggested opponents should not underestimate her. Independent-Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman stated that McCain made a [...] "bold choice" [...] in picking a [...] "maverick {{who has done}} {{exactly the same thing}} at the state level that he's done at the federal level." [...] However, some Republicans did not receive the choice favorably. Charles Krauthammer of the Washington Post wrote, [...] "The Palin selection completely undercuts the argument about Obama's inexperience and readiness to lead.... To gratuitously undercut the remarkably successful 'Is he ready to lead' line of attack seems near suicidal." [...] David Frum of National Review wrote: [...] "The longer <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> the less well this selection sits with me.... If it were your decision, and you were putting your country first, would you put an untested small-town mayor [...] a heartbeat away from the presidency?". Following an NBC interview, Peggy Noonan commented, [...] "It's over... the most qualified? No." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jimmy Hollis was a 25-year-old {{insurance}} agent {{at the time}} of the attack. He was born September 25, 1920. He lived at 3502 N. State Line Avenue; a house which no longer exists. On the night of his attack, he was at the movies on a double date with his brother, Bob, who was also an {{insurance agent}}. After the movie, he dropped his brother and his date off. While he was taking his girlfriend home, they stopped on a lateral road off of Richmond where the attack occurred. Hollis suffered three fractures in his skull and was hospitalized for several days at Texarkana Hospital (also known as Pine Street Hospital) which stood at W. 5th and Pine street and no longer exists. He was in critical condition. After four days, he showed slight improvement but was still not fully conscious. He was released from the hospital on Saturday, March 9. His doctor told him it would be [...] "some time" [...] before he was completely well again and that he was not to work for six months. By the middle of May, he was still recovering from his injuries. Three months after the attack, he stated [...] "I still get nervous when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> At night, on the street, even downtown." [...] Hollis was questioned several times by officers after the other killings. Starting at the end of April, he spent a week with Larey in Frederick, Oklahoma before residing in Shreveport, Louisiana. Hollis eventually married and had seven children. He had a Bachelor of Arts in history and a Master of Science in Public Administration. He worked for the US government. He loved to dress in western clothing, including a cowboy hat, a holster and a pistol. He appeared in the 1971 television film They've Killed President Lincoln as Vice President Andrew Johnson. He eventually moved to Houston where he began working for NASA. Hollis died in his sleep at the age of 54. His family remembered him for his jokes and sense of humor, as well as his love for the outdoors, including camping and hunting.|$|E
