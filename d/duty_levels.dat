40|$|Smoking is {{the single}} largest cause of avoidable death in the European Union {{accounting}} for over half a million deaths each year. One in ten of all 11 -year olds have been drunk twice or more times, possibly causing lasting physical and mental harm. Electronic gaming machines are the crack cocaine of gambling. Consumer sovereignty, on the other hand, indicates {{that people should be}} allowed to smoke {{as long as they do}} not harm others. There is sound medical evidence, furthermore, that a drink each day keeps the doctor away, while recreational gambling can be an enjoyable form of entertainment for many people. These and other salient facts about the harmful and positive effects of smoking, drinking and gambling provide the background for a dispassionate economic analysis of the taxation and regulation of these activities. The main message the studies convey is that it would be unrealistic to rely solely on <b>duty</b> <b>levels</b> and differentiation to curb abusive use. <b>Duty</b> <b>levels</b> do have a clear impact in restraining consumption by children and young adults - an important priority for policy. But complementary policies - including direct regulation and provision of information - also have a meaningful role to play in each of the markets for tobacco, alcohol and gambling. ...|$|E
40|$|A brake {{which is}} {{designed}} to provide a limited proportion of the total braking force at normal decelerations may be able to brake the car at high decelerations but may suffer damage when used for emergency braking. A conventional braking system uses 100 % of friction braking to retard a moving car while with regenerative braking the friction brakes will supply less than 100 %. This paper starts to establish the working limitations of lightweight brakes for regenerative braking in extreme deceleration. Thermo-mechanical analysis can be used to predict the temperature profile on disc surfaces and analytical and experimental methods can be used to predict the thermal braking performance to calculate temperature rises under emergency braking conditions and brake cooling.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{contribute}} theoretically to the lit-erature on the effects of antidumping policy on trade diversion. Trade diversion refers to a shift in trade flows away from firms whose imports are under scrutiny for dumping (named firms) to firms that import the same product but are not faced by any investigations (non-named firms). Previous empirical studies show that import diversion in Eu-rope- compared to the United States- is limited, suggesting that EU’s antidumping policy is more effective in keeping imports out. The explanations formulated to account for the heterogeneity in trade di-version are the lower <b>duty</b> <b>levels</b> and the greater extent of uncertainty surrounding the EU antidumping policy.

Also the trends in alcohol prices and alcohol consumption will be discussed. Material. Material concerning alcohol taxes and consumption comes from available statistics and published literature. Results. This paper shows that despite many attempts the EU has not been able to harmonise alcohol excise duty rates in its member states. The importance of alcohol taxes as an alcohol control measure has decreased as the real value of alcohol excise duty rates has decreased in most EU countries during the last decades. Discussion. In most European countries the share of alcohol taxes of the price of alcoholic beverages is quite low. Therefore, increasing alcohol excise duty rates would in most countries lead to increased alcohol tax revenues to the public sector. Consequently, increasing alcohol excise duty rates would serve both the fiscal and the health and social policy interests of the state...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{benefits}} of electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid vehicles (HVs) is their potential to recuperate braking energy. Regenerative braking (RB) will minimize <b>duty</b> <b>levels</b> on the brakes, giving advantages including extended brake rotor and friction material life and, more significantly, reduced brake mass and minimised brake pad wear. In this thesis, a mathematical analysis (MATLAB) has been used to analyse the accessibility of regenerative braking energy during a single-stop braking event. The results have indicated that a friction brake could be downsized while maintaining the same functional requirements of the vehicle braking in the standard brakes, including thermomechanical performance (heat transfer coefficient estimation, temperature distribution, cooling and stress deformation). This would allow lighter brakes to be designed and fitted with confidence in a normal passenger car alongside a hybrid electric drive. An approach has been established and a lightweight brake disc design analysed FEA and experimentally verified is presented in this research. Thermal performance was a key factor which was studied using the 3 D model in FEA simulations. Ultimately, a design approach for lightweight brake discs suitable for use in any car-sized hybrid vehicle has been developed and tested. The results from experiments on a prototype lightweight brake disc were shown to illustrate the effects of RBS/friction combination in terms of weight reduction. The design requirement, including reducing the thickness, would affect the temperature distribution and increase stress at the critical area. Based on the relationship obtained between rotor weight, thickness and each performance requirement, criteria have been established for designing lightweight brake discs in a vehicle with regenerative braking.

40|$|One of {{the stated}} {{advantages}} of electric vehicles (EVs), and hybrid vehicles (HVs) is {{their ability to}} recuperate braking energy. Regenerative braking (RB) would extend the working range of an EV or HV provided that any extra energy consumption e. g. from increased vehicle mass and system losses did not outweigh the saving from energy recuperation, also reduce <b>duty</b> <b>levels</b> on the brakes themselves, giving advantages including extended brake rotor and friction material life, but more importantly reduced brake mass, minimise brake pad wear. The objective {{of this paper is}} to define how much braking energy could be absorbed by a regenerative braking system (RBS) on a passenger car, hence defining the duty envelope of the friction brake. This will enable lighter brakes to be designed and fitted with confidence in a normal passenger car alongside a hybrid electric drive. In this paper, a mathematical analysis (MATLAB) is used to analyse the availability of regenerative braking energy during a single stop braking event. Secondly a computer simulation model based on Advanced Vehicle Simulator (ADVISOR) is used to simulate both single stop and drive cycle braking. Based on both sets of results it is shown how much of the total braking energy could be absorbed by the RBS of an example hybrid car in single stop braking and drive cycle braking. Thermal performance is a key factor which is studied using FEA simulations. Ultimately a design method for lightweight brakes suitable for use on any car-sized hybrid vehicle will be developed.

40|$|The {{automotive}} industry has {{for many years}} identified weight reduction {{as a way of}} improving product competitiveness and thus the ability to make profits. One area that has been examined for weight reduction is vehicle with regenerative braking system (RBS). The greatest advantages of electric vehicles (EVs), and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) is their ability to recover significant amounts of braking energy using a RBS. Regenerative braking is an effective method to extend brake disc life, minimise disc rotor weight, minimise brake pad wear and to extend the working range of an EV or HEV. Regenerative braking would extend the working range of an EV or HEV provided that any extra energy consumption e. g. from increased vehicle mass and system losses did not outweigh the saving from energy recuperation, also reduce <b>duty</b> <b>levels</b> on the brakes themselves, giving advantages including extended brake rotor and friction material life, but more importantly reduced brake mass, minimise brake pad wear. The objective of this research is to define thermal performance on lightweight disc brake models.

Ultimately a design method for lightweight brakes suitable for use on any car-sized hybrid vehicle was used from previous analysis. The design requirement, including reducing the thickness, would affect the temperature distribution and increase stress at the critical area. Based on the relationship obtained between rotor weight, thickness, undercut effect and offset between hat and friction ring, criteria have been established for designing lightweight brake discs in a vehicle with regenerative braking...|$|E
