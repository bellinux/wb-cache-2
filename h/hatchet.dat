5|$|Asylum {{digitally}} created {{weapons for}} various scenes. In {{the scene in}} which Nolan is killed suddenly by {{a shot in the}} head from Jason's arrow, Asylum created the arrow in post-production. Another scene involved Jason hurling a <b>hatchet</b> at Lawrence as he runs away, striking him in the back. The shot of a <b>hatchet</b> flying through the airin one instance appearing in the same frame as the actorwould be too difficult to achieve practically. Asylum rendered a complete 3D model of the <b>hatchet</b> then inserted the model into the frames leading up to the frame in which it hits the character in the back. One of the final images added by Asylum was for Trent's death scene. Here, Asylum digitally created a metal spike that bursts through Trent's chest as Jason slams him onto the back of a tow truck.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} edge-ground <b>hatchets</b> were {{identified}} from various locations in central Queensland during recent investigations conducted {{as part of}} the Gooreng Gooreng Cultural Heritage Project. Macroscopic examination suggested that some <b>hatchets</b> were manufactured on a distinctive form of rhyolitic tuff which is restricted in occurrence to the Town of Seventeen Seventy - Agnes Water area on the southern Curtis Coast. The <b>hatchets</b> are distributed over an area of some 6000 km 2, centred on the town of Lowmead within the ethnohistorically documented linguistic borders of Gooreng Gooreng country. Laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) was employed in an attempt to provenance the <b>hatchets</b> to particular outcrops of rhyolitic tuff on the basis of trace element geochemistry. Preliminary results confirm that all <b>hatchets</b> identified as rhyolitic tuff exhibit a similar geochemical signature. Moreover, this geochemistry can be correlated with the background samples from the Ironbark Site Complex, the only major rhyolite quarry known in the region. The study enhances our understanding of past Aboriginal lifeways in the region by situating strategies of stone procurement and use in the landscape...|$|R

5|$|A new {{paper on}} the cranio-dental {{morphology}} of Allosaurus and how it worked has deemed the <b>hatchet</b> jaw attack unlikely, reinterpreting the unusually wide gape as an adaptation to allow Allosaurus to deliver a muscle-driven bite to large prey, with the weaker jaw muscles being a trade-off {{to allow for the}} widened gape.|$|E
5|$|The Governors {{have won}} the Saint Paul City Conference title for {{football}} 13 times, their last conference title coming in 2006. Johnson's chief rival is Harding Senior High School, and the two football squads play each other annually for the <b>Hatchet</b> trophy. The rivalry is the oldest continuous one in the Saint Paul City Conference with the teams meeting each year since 1932.|$|E
5|$|As {{the most}} {{abundant}} large predator in the Morrison Formation, Allosaurus {{was at the top}} of the food chain, probably preying on contemporaneous large herbivorous dinosaurs, and perhaps even other predators. Potential prey included ornithopods, stegosaurids, and sauropods. Some paleontologists interpret Allosaurus as having had cooperative social behavior, and hunting in packs, while others believe individuals may have been aggressive toward each other, and that congregations of this genus are the result of lone individuals feeding on the same carcasses. It may have attacked large prey by ambush, using its upper jaw like a <b>hatchet.</b>|$|E

5|$|Forming {{the sides}} {{of the back of the}} skull is the exoccipital, which {{surrounds}} most of the foramen magnum. The Eustachian tube extends downwards across the basoccipital and basisphenoid; these bones are thickened on either side of the tube in K. langenbergensis. K. guimarotae has a small rounded foramen beside the tube on the basoccipital, and a tuberosity bearing a ridge above. On the front of the basoccipital in both species, there are two rounded depressions near the bottom. The basisphenoid resembles a triangular <b>hatchet</b> in shape when viewed from the side.|$|E
5|$|From Campobello, Eddy sailed up the Saint John River to Maugerville, where 27 {{men were}} recruited, {{and then up}} to the Maliseet {{settlement}} at Aukpaque (just upriver from present-day Fredericton). There he learned the bad news that Pierre Tomah, the main Maliseet chief, {{was not interested in}} taking up the <b>hatchet.</b> Eddy was able to convince Ambroise St. Aubin, one of Tomah's competitors, and 15 men to join the expedition in exchange for an agreement with the Maugerville community to support the families of those men. In another disappointment, none of the local Acadians joined, contrary to assertions St. Aubin had made to Eddy during a previous visit to the area.|$|E
5|$|Lt. Blue and Parrish {{returned}} to Sugar Hollow where Parsons was awaiting them, and Parsons set about locating pine {{from which to}} make torches to light {{their way out of}} the hollow. Parsons carried with him a small <b>hatchet,</b> and began splitting pine in the darkness to fashion a torch. He accidentally struck himself in the knee with his <b>hatchet,</b> and Blue applied a handkerchief to his wound to stop its bleeding. The three men traveled through the dark and rain to the nearby home of Frank Carter, where they ate and dried their clothes by the fire. The following morning, they mounted their horses and traveled to Rev. Harris' home, where Parsons and Blue parted with Parrish. Parsons and Blue continued east over Town Hill and reached George Thompson's residence on the Little Cacapon River, which had risen due to the previous night's rainfall. They remained with Thompson for two days until the river subsided, then traveled to Blue's Gap, where they set up camp. There, Lt. Blue received orders from Col. Angus William McDonald to carry out an expedition for General Stonewall Jackson to ascertain the number of Union Army infantry, cavalry, and artillery present in and around Romney; he was accompanied on this expedition by Col. Parsons' son, Isaac Parsons, Jr., and by W. V. Parsons.|$|E

Webb had taken Jackalow aboard his ship to Newark; Jackalow had applied for lodging in a cellar in Newark; Jackalow had given two different names for himself in Egg Harbor when relating {{the fate of the}} Leetes; he had bought supplies in New York City and Brooklyn. At the close of evidence, the government had examined 17 witnesses, half the number for which it had issued subpoenas.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Inca dominance, {{specialized}} {{long distance}} merchants provided the highlanders with goods such as gold nuggets, copper hatchets, cocoa, salt etc. for redistribution among the locals, and were {{key players in}} the politics of the region. <b>Hatchet</b> shaped copper currency was produced by the Peruvian people, in order to obtain valuables from pre Columbian Ecuador. A maritime exchange system stretched from the west coast of Mexico to southernmost Peru, trading mostly in Spondylus, which represented rain and fertility and was considered the principal food of the gods by the people of the Inca empire. Spondylus was used in elite rituals, and the effective redistribution of it had political effect in the Andes during the pre-Hispanic times.|$|E
5|$|On the December 27 {{episode of}} Raw, The Nexus, minus Barrett, {{announced}} {{they were under}} new management and offered to bury the <b>hatchet</b> with Cena, to which he refused. The Nexus attacked Cena, leaving a Nexus armband in the ring during the process. As the group retreated, CM Punk, who had attacked Cena with a steel chair twice the week before, came to the ring to apparently attack Cena, but instead put on the armband left behind to symbolically announce his allegiance with The Nexus, becoming leader the following week by manipulating Barrett's banishment from the group. On the January 17 episode of Raw, Cena returned and faced Punk in a match, which ended in a no contest after Cena was attacked by the debuting Mason Ryan, who later joined The Nexus. Cena competed in the 2011 Royal Rumble match at the pay-per-view, which saw Cena eliminate most of the Nexus members, ending his feud with the stable.|$|E

Siegmund Lubin had attempted {{to capitalize on the}} success of Kansas Saloon Smashers by making a film where Nation herself appeared; when he was unable to contact her, an actress was hired to play her. Lubin arranged with a Camden bar owner to film a staged destruction scene; however, the actress proved so convincing that bystanders began to destroy the bar for real and Lubin was forced to pay up to seven hundred dollars damage.|$|E
5|$|While Marguerite Louise's {{behaviour}} was tolerated by {{the previous}} Abbess of Montmartre, the new Abbess, Madame d'Harcourt, frequently complained about her to the Grand Duke and the King. In retaliation, Marguerite Louise threatened to kill the Abbess with a <b>hatchet</b> and a pistol, and formed a clique against her. It was {{in this context that}} Cosimo III consented, in line with her wishes, to Marguerite Louise's departure for a new convent, at Saint-Mandé on the Eastern outskirts of Paris, on the condition she go out only with the King Louis XIV's explicit permission and be attended by a chamberlain of his choice. Since she would not agree, her pension was suspended, only to be resumed when Louis XIV compelled her to yield.|$|E

5|$|After {{spending}} {{about a decade}} living as a recluse on Mercer Island near Seattle, Russell rose to prominence again {{at the turn of}} the millennium. Russell's Rules was published in 2001, and in January 2006, he convinced Miami Heat superstar center Shaquille O'Neal to bury the <b>hatchet</b> with fellow NBA superstar and former Los Angeles Lakers teammate Kobe Bryant, with whom O'Neal had a bitter public feud. Later that year, on November 17, 2006, the two-time NCAA winner Russell was recognized for his impact on college basketball as a member of the founding class of the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame. He was one of five, along with John Wooden, Oscar Robertson, Dean Smith and Dr. James Naismith, selected to represent the inaugural class. On May 20, 2007, Russell was awarded an honorary doctorate by Suffolk University, where he served as its commencement speaker, and Russell received an honorary degree from Harvard University on June 7, 2007. On June 18, 2007, Russell was inducted as a member of the founding class of the FIBA Hall of Fame. Russell was also honored during the 2009 NBA All-Star Weekend in Phoenix.|$|E
5|$|Carlton {{then turned}} his {{attention}} to the other six residents, pouring gasoline underneath the door of the far end of the residence and setting it on fire. Draftsman Herbert Fritz managed to break open a window and escape, though he broke his arm in the process. Carlton then entered the other dining room and killed Brodelle. He then hid, waiting for the other residents to try to escape. As foreman William Weston and his 13-year-old son Ernest ran through the door, Carlton attacked with the <b>hatchet.</b> The Westons escaped, but Ernest died from his wounds hours later. Carlton sought out the final two residents, laborer Thomas Brunker and gardener David Lindblom. Brunker and Lindblom managed to fight off Carlton and escape, but died days later from their burns and injuries. With the house empty, Carlton ran to the basement and into a fireproof furnace chamber. He brought a small vial of hydrochloric acid with him as a fallback plan in case the heat became too much for him to handle. Carlton did attempt suicide by swallowing the acid, but it failed to kill him.|$|E
5|$|During the English Civil War, the Royal Fort was {{considered}} the strongest part of Bristol's defences, and {{it was to the}} fort that the Royalists retreated when they found themselves under siege from the Parliamentarians. It fell to the parliamentary forces in 1645 and was subsequently demolished. St Nicholas's Almshouses were built in 1652 to provide care for the poor. Several public houses were also built in this period, including the Llandoger Trow on King Street and the <b>Hatchet</b> Inn. More churches were built, including St Michael on the Mount Without. It served the St Michaels hill area, one of the first areas outside the city walls to be colonised by the wealthy merchants who were by then trying to escape the overcrowded and unhealthy conditions in the city centre. The city was by this time beginning to expand rapidly beyond its traditional city walls, and the surrounding villages were starting to become suburbs, such as the villages of Horfield and Brislington. Both had their own churches, the Church of the Holy Trinity with St Edmund and St Lukes respectively.|$|E
