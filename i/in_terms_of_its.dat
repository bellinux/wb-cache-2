Reflecting the region's status as an epicenter of folk, funk, and alternative rock music, the city served as the launching pad for several of the 20th century's most influential musicians, including Bob Dylan and Prince.|$|E
5|$|Indium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolIn and atomic number 49. It is a post-transition metal {{that makes up}} 0.21parts per million of the Earth's crust. Very soft and malleable, indium has a melting point higher than sodium and gallium, but lower than lithium and tin. Chemically, indium is similar to gallium and thallium, and it is largely intermediate between the two <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> properties. Indium was discovered in 1863 by Ferdinand Reich and Hieronymous Theodor Richter by spectroscopic methods. They named it for the indigo blue line in its spectrum. Indium was isolated the next year.|$|E

Wagner had publicly analysed the Oedipus myth before Freud was born <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> psychological significance, insisting that incestuous desires are natural and normal, and perceptively exhibiting {{the relationship between}} sexuality and anxiety. Georg Groddeck considered the Ring as the first manual of psychoanalysis.|$|E

5|$|The {{book was}} {{noted for its}} heft, <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> actual page numbers, {{exhaustive}} research, and dense academic language. The writing does occasionally include illustrative anecdotes and some plain language. Rifkin synthesizes research and material from fields such as literature and the arts, theology, philosophy, anthropology, sociology, political science, psychology, and communication theory. The book was described as sociobiology. The Empathic Civilization was contrasted to the book Crisis Economics by Nouriel Roubini and Stephen Mihm, as reaching different conclusions but being complementary by offering valid alternative futures different from contemporary belief in social progress.|$|E
5|$|Alternative rock {{is a broad}} {{umbrella}} term {{consisting of}} music that differs greatly <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> sound, its social context, and its regional roots. By {{the end of the}} 1980s magazines and zines, college radio airplay, and word of mouth had increased the prominence and highlighted the diversity of alternative rock, helping to define a number of distinct styles (and music scenes) such as noise pop, indie rock, grunge, and alternative hip hop. Most of these subgenres had achieved minor mainstream notice and a few bands representing them, such as Hüsker Dü and R.E.M., had even signed to major labels. But most alternative bands' commercial success was limited in comparison to other genres of rock and pop music at the time, and most acts remained signed to independent labels and received relatively little attention from mainstream radio, television, or newspapers. With the breakthrough of Nirvana and the popularity of the grunge and Britpop movements in the 1990s, alternative rock entered the musical mainstream and many alternative bands became successful.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} restructuring, 3G {{also moved}} to change many aspects of {{corporate}} operations throughout 2011-2012. One of the first moves was to terminate Burger King's relationship with ad agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky, replacing it with McGarryBowen. 3G also began a menu restructuring, with the first product being a revamped version of BK's Chicken Tenders product. Other new or reformulated products would follow. <b>In</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> franchise operations, Burger King initiated a move to become more like competitors Subway and KFC and began to sell off the majority of corporately owned restaurants {{in order to become}} an exclusive franchised operation. 3G also moved to mend relations with its American franchises, which had become rather rancorous during TPG's tenure.

40|$|Abstract. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to compare the mechanical properties of fly ash artificial geopolymer aggregates with natural aggregate (rock) <b>in</b> <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> impact strength, specific gravity and water absorption. The raw materials used were fly ash, sodium hydroxide, sodium silicate and natural aggregate. After the artificial geopolymer aggregate has been produced, its water absorption, specific gravity and aggregate impact test has been done. All results obtained were compared to natural aggregate. The result shows that the fly ash geopolymer aggregate are lighter than natural aggregate <b>in</b> <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> specific gravity. The impact value for fly ash artificial geopolymer aggregate slightly high compared to natural aggregate while it has high water absorption value compared to natural aggregate. As conclusion, the fly ash artificial geopolymer aggregate can be used as one of the construction materials in concrete as an alternative for coarse aggregate besides natural aggregate with more lightweight properties...|$|R

5|$|Mon thong is {{the most}} commercially sought after for its thick, {{full-bodied}} creamy and mild sweet tasting flesh with relatively moderate smell emitted and smaller seeds, while Chanee is the best <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> resistance to infection by Phytophthora palmivora. Kan Yao is somewhat less common, but prized for its longer window of time when it is both sweet and odorless at the same time. Among all the cultivars in Thailand, five are currently in large-scale commercial cultivation: Chanee, Mon Thong, Kan Yao, Ruang, and Kradum. There are more than 100 registered cultivars since the 1920s in Malaysia and up to 193 cultivars by 1992, and many superior cultivars have been identified through competitions held at the annual Malaysian Agriculture, Horticulture, and Agrotourism Show. In Vietnam, the same process has been achieved through competitions held by the Southern Fruit Research Institute. A recently popular variety is, Cat Mountain King or Musang King.|$|E

5|$|Narcissi are now {{popular as}} {{ornamental}} plants for gardens, parks and as cut flowers, providing colour {{from the end}} of winter to the beginning of summer in temperate regions. They {{are one of the most}} popular spring flowers and one of the major ornamental spring flowering bulb crops, being produced both for their bulbs and cut flowers, though cultivation of private and public spaces is greater than the area of commercial production. Over a century of breeding has resulted in thousands of varieties and cultivars being available from both general and specialist suppliers. They are normally sold as dry bulbs to be planted in late summer and autumn. They are one of the most economically important ornamental plants. Plant breeders have developed some daffodils with double, triple, or ambiguously multiple rows and layers of segments. Many of the breeding programs have concentrated on the corona (trumpet or cup), <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> length, shape, and colour, and the surrounding perianth or even as in varieties derived from N. poeticus a very reduced form.|$|E

5|$|The {{venue for}} Il ritorno's première {{was at one}} time {{thought to be the}} Teatro Cassiano, but {{scholarly}} consensus considers it most likely that both the 1639–40 and 1640–41 performances were at the Teatro SS Giovanni e Paolo. This view is supported by a study of the performance schedules for other Venice operas, and by the knowledge that the Manelli company had severed its connection with the Teatro Cassiano before the 1639–40 season. The Teatro SS Giovanni e Paolo, owned by the Grimani family, would also be the venue for the premières of Monteverdi's Le nozze d'Enea and Poppea. <b>In</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> staging Il ritorno is, says Carter, fairly undemanding, requiring three basic sets—a palace, a seascape and a woodland scene—which were more or less standard for early Venetian opera. It did, however, demand some spectacular special effects: the Phaecian ship turns to stone, an airborne chariot transports Minerva, a bolt of fire transforms Ulisse.|$|E
