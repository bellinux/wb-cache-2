5|$|The {{following}} season, {{when the}} club's new manager, Ciro Ferrara, {{was forced into}} a tactical switch due to injuries to first choice midfielders, Mauro Camoranesi and Claudio Marchisio, Giovinco was variously inserted into the starting line-up; he helped Juventus to a 5–1 defeat of Sampdoria in only his fourth start of the season. Under the following manager, Alberto Zaccheroni, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> featured. In April, he sustained a training ground injury and was ruled out {{for the rest of}} the season after undergoing tests.|$|E
25|$|He {{has played}} {{domestic}} cricket for 11 years now, making his first-class debut for Tamil Nadu cricket team against Sinhalese Sports Club, at Colombo, in 2000, {{and he also}} made his List A debut for the same team against the same team in the same year. Despite that, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> known out of the Indian domestic circuit.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> {{more than}} five feet four inches but carried himself with great dignity. His head was exactly {{the shape of an}} egg, and he always perched it a little on one side. His {{moustache}} was very stiff and military. Even if everything on his face was covered, the tips of moustache and the pink-tipped nose would be visible.|$|E

6000|$|... "I know he used," [...] said Lady de Courcy, {{looking very}} wise, and rather suspicious. She {{certainly}} had sufficient domestic reasons for disliking the propensity; [...] "I know he used; {{and when a}} man begins, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> ever cured." ...|$|R
25|$|He was an {{important}} part of England's Twenty20 team that won the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 tournament in the West Indies. He top-scored in England's group games against the West Indies and his native Ireland, as well as the Super Eights game against New Zealand. Due to effective team bowling and half-centuries from Kevin Pietersen and Craig Kieswetter, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> needed in the semi-final against Sri Lanka and final against Australia, finishing not-out in both matches.|$|E
25|$|During the 1830s, Sunderland {{became the}} most {{important}} shipbuilding centre in the country, and by 1840 there were 65 shipyards on the river. It was at this time, that Pile walked {{the banks of the}} River Wear, visiting the shipyards and never growing tired of seeing ships in the various stages of construction. As he grew older he could tell the name of every ship belonging to Sunderland, and who built them. It was said of him after his death, that being born in a shipyard <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> ever out of one.|$|E
25|$|Spitz went to {{work for}} ABC Sports in 1976 and worked on many sports presentations, {{including}} coverage of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. In 1985 he appeared as a TV announcer in Challenge of a Lifetime. He continued as a broadcaster for some time, but within a few years, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> seen as a public figure except perhaps as a commentator for swimming events like the 2004 Summer Olympics. Instead Spitz focused on his real estate company in Beverly Hills and hobbies such as sailing.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, Bertolt Brecht wrote a verse {{commentary}} Über Schillers Gedicht [...] "Die Bürgschaft", a sonnet ironically praising the Golden Age in which contract had such moral force that the tyrant realizes that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> needed. This {{has been set}} to music by Hanns Eisler.|$|R
25|$|Before {{the start}} of auction Chargers decided not to retain any players and have put all the players in auction. The much awaited Auction on 8 and 9 January 2011 {{lived up to the}} expectation; in fact it {{exceeded}} in many ways. Daniel Christian was termed as million dollar baby as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> known to the world cricket at that point of time. Chargers did pick very good players in Cameron White, JP Duminy, Ishant Sharma, Dale Steyn and skipper Kumar Sangakkara. But at the same time Chargers lost many of Indian players such RP Singh and Rohit Sharma as well as Australians Andrew Symonds and Adam Gilchrist.|$|E
25|$|Abilgaard {{was also}} known as a {{religious}} freethinker and an advocate of political reform. In spite of his service to (and in his artwork the glorification of) the government, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> a great supporter of the monarchy or of the state church. He supported the emancipation of the farmers and participated in the collection of monies for the Freedom Monument (Frihedsstøtten) in 1792. He contributed a design for the monument, as well as for two of the reliefs at its base. He got caught into controversies {{at the end of the}} 18th century because of his controversial statements and satirical drawings. He was inspired by the French Revolution, and in 1789–1790 he tried to incorporate these revolutionary ideals into the Knights' Room at Christiansborg Palace. However, the King rejected his designs.|$|E
25|$|In {{his final}} term at Oxford Fry {{suffered}} his first (but not last) bout of mental illness, suffering a mental breakdown. There {{were a number}} of contributing factors to this. During his time at Oxford Fry had accumulated disturbingly large debts. In an attempt to alleviate his financial difficulties, Fry capitalised on his reputation to make some much-needed money. As well as writing articles (including one for Wisden), he did some private tutoring but although such activities reduced his debts they did not clear them and, further increased the intense pressure on his time. Fry's continuing indebtedness provides the most obvious explanation for his acceptance of an offer to do some nude modelling. These financial problems combined with his mother being seriously ill, placed an unbearable strain on him. Although he was able to sit his final exams, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> in any fit state to do so, having hardly read a line for weeks. The result was Fry scraping a Fourth, bringing one of Oxford's most spectacular and successful careers to an inglorious end. So in the summer of 1895, only months after being the toast of Oxford, Fry found himself saddled with mounting debts and no way with which to repay them. In the short term, cricket came to his rescue. He was offered, and accepted, the chance to tour South Africa as a member of Lord Hawke's 1895–96 England touring party.|$|E
50|$|In Medieval hagiography <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> noted. Yet, Falco is {{the first}} bishop of Maastricht, after Servatius, who <b>is</b> securly documented. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> {{mentioned}} in an undated letter sent by Saint Remigius, in which Remigius complains about Falco usurping certain rights in Mouzon. He allegedly attended the Council of Auvergne (535) and the Fifth Council of Orléans.|$|R
50|$|Lóðurr {{is a god}} in Norse mythology. In the Poetic Edda poem Völuspá <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{assigned}} a role in animating the first humans, but apart from that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> ever mentioned, and remains obscure. Scholars have variously identified him with Loki, Vé, Vili and Freyr, but consensus has not been reached on any one theory.|$|R

500|$|As [...] "a male {{favourite}} to {{a virgin}} queen", Robert Dudley {{found himself in}} an unprecedented situation. His apartments at court were next to hers, and—perceived as knowing [...] "the Queen and her nature best of any man"—his influence was matched by few. Another side of such privileges was Elizabeth's possessiveness and jealousy. His company was essential for her well-being and for many years <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> allowed to leave. Sir Christopher Hatton reported a growing emergency when the Earl was away {{for a few weeks}} in 1578: [...] "This court wanteth your presence. Her majesty is unaccompanied and, I assure you, the chambers are almost empty." ...|$|E
500|$|Cardus {{had been}} known to Australian readers since the 1920s, when The Argus in Melbourne {{reported}} his view that Australians made cricket [...] "a war game... with an intensity of purpose too deadly for a mere game." [...] His books on cricket were widely reviewed in the Australian press in the 1920s and 30s; one critic commented in 1929, [...] "Mr. Cardus mingles fancy with fact. The latter is preferable." [...] Another Australian writer, quoting him extensively in 1932, observed, [...] "Mr. Cardus is a gifted writer and a most impartial critic." [...] By 1936 {{he was known to}} a considerable section of the Australian public as a cricket writer, although <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> known there in his musical capacity.|$|E
500|$|Elena Pignatti, who had {{employed}} Morisi {{after she}} left the Mortaras in 1857—her words about Morisi's misconduct had formed part of the Mortaras' appeal to the Pope—testified that [...] "seven or eight years ago... a son of the Mortaras, whose name I don't know, became sick, and {{it was said that}} he was going to die. Around then, one morning... I ran into Morisi. Among the other things we talked about, she—without mentioning the child's illness—asked me, 'I've heard that if you baptise a Jewish child who's about to die he goes to Heaven and gets indulgence; isn't that right?' I don't remember what I told her, but when the Mortara boy was kidnapped by order of the Dominican Father, I was sure that he must have been the one who was sick". Pignatti said that she had herself seen Edgardo during his illness, and Marianna sitting by the crib—"Since his mother was crying, and despaired for his life, I thought he was dying, also because of his appearance: his eyes were closed, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> moving." [...] She added that during the three months when Morisi worked for her in late 1857, the servant had been summoned to San Domenico four or five times, and had said that the inquisitor had promised her a dowry.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of Don Quixote commentators and scholars have sided with Cervantes in mocking Silva’s works, {{though many of}} them had neglected to read them. Though <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> remembered today, de Silva enjoyed considerable success during the sixteenth century. His works are currently being re-evaluated and examined for their contribution to Spanish literature in the Siglo de Oro.|$|R
5000|$|... • Artotrogus (parasitus ‘suck-up’ 'sponge'): the soldier’s slave, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{around to}} boost his master’s ego. Present {{in the opening}} scene, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> around in the remainder. His {{compliments}} earn him food for his ever-hungry belly and serve as ironical and humorous quips to the audience who rightly hears them as insults. So daft <b>is</b> Pyrgopolynices that <b>he</b> genuinely believes Artotrogus is loyal.|$|R
50|$|Although <b>he</b> <b>is</b> painted as an anti-hero in Interview {{with the}} Vampire, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> quick {{to defend his}} own behavior. In The Vampire Lestat, he spends much of the book telling people <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> the monster {{previous}} narrators have made him out to be. In much of the book, (and its follow up, Queen of the Damned), <b>he</b> <b>is</b> instead painted as a fun-loving hero who even leads the charge against Akasha, the vampire queen.|$|R
2500|$|Historian Fred Anderson {{says that}} Washington's Providence was, [...] "a {{generally}} benevolent, {{as well as}} an omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient being, but <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> the kind of warm and loving God embraced by the evangelical Protestants." ...|$|E

Esposito stated that for the third season, he incorporated his yoga training in his performance. Gus is the coolest cucumber that ever walked the Earth. I think about Eddie Olmos way back in Miami Vice. He was like dead– <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> breathing. I thought, how is this guy just standing in this fire and doing nothing? Gus has totally allowed me that level of flexibility and relaxation– not because he has ultimate power and he knows he can take someone's life. He's just confident.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his early}} 50s, Elliott's {{work on the}} west coast {{declined}} after 9/11, and he was thinking of returning to the Boston area. He was in Boston working on a movie and visited his old friend Livingston Taylor, who was then on the faculty at Boston's Berklee College of Music. Elliott then learned of a [...] job opening there in the Contemporary Writing and Production Department. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> an academic, yet Elliott had the real-world experience that suited the job perfectly, [...] and he accepted the offer and began teaching at Berklee in 2004. As for his teaching methods, Elliott stated, [...] "I teach them what works with players, how players like to work together, and how instruments work together." [...] After returning to Boston, he soon began working with the Boston Pops Orchestra. Over the years, has written more than 50 pieces for them including the orchestra's holiday shows and their Gershwin celebration tour.|$|E
2500|$|Parker {{gradually}} introduced Transcendentalist {{ideas into}} his sermons. He tempered his radicalism with diplomacy and discretion, however. “I preach abundant heresies,” {{he wrote to}} a friend, “and they all go down—for the listeners {{do not know how}} heretical they are.” For years he had wrestled with the factuality of the Hebrew Scriptures, and by 1837 he was wishing “some wise man would now write a book…and show up the absurdity of…the Old Testament miracles, prophecies, dreams, miraculous births, etc.’” <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> alone. “‘What shall we do with the Old Testament?’ asked James Walker in 1838. ‘That question is of such frequent recurrence among laymen as well as clergymen, that any well-considered attempt to answer it, or supply the means of answering it, is almost sure of hearty welcome." [...] Questions regarding biblical realism and meaning, and the answers clergy increasingly found through the German-based higher criticism, formed the basis of liberal Christianity as it emerged and developed throughout the nineteenth century.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1987 and 1989, Fulci made a {{deal with}} {{producers}} Antonio Lucidi and Luigi Nannerini to lend his name to the credits of some low-budget horror films that he had not directed, simply to make the films more marketable to distributors outside of Italy. Although he did supervise the special gore effects in both The Curse and The Murder Secret (and directed some additional footage to lengthen the running time of Hansel and Gretel), <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> at all involved with some of the other projects which bore the [...] "Lucio Fulci Presents" [...] label on their video display boxes. Fulci tried unsuccessfully to have his name removed from the credits of one film in particular, Gianni Martucci's The Red Monks, since he swore he had no involvement with its production (although the film's producer Pino Buricchi begged him to let them use his name in the credits). The following year, in reciprocation for the use of his name, Fulci was permitted to use gore footage culled from these various films to make his infamous A Cat in the Brain.|$|E
