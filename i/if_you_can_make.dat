500|$|The Guardian {{columnist}} Zoe Williams criticised {{the actual}} waterboarding in the torture scene, saying [...] "it's really unpleasant, [...] concurred. 'I only lasted five to 10 seconds, {{and the sound}} of my voice crying out to stop isn't me acting.' Pal, that's nice that you're not showing off but this is all wrong and despicable: it's like locking yourself and 10 friends into a loo on a commuter train, to see {{what it would be like}} on the train to Auschwitz. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> it stop whenever you like, you're learning nothing and kicking people in the face while you're at it." ...|$|E
500|$|Major Naspany {{was then}} asked {{what to do}} with the fighters and he responded by saying, [...] "Send 'em to New York City still. Continue! Go! This is what I got.

At 9:03am, United Airlines Flight 175 hit the South Tower as the fighters were progressing to their holding position. The Northeast Air Defense Sector was not advised of this hijacked aircraft until 9:03.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the end of}} {{the eighth}} series, Last Broadcast held a poll for the top five most {{shocking}} death scenes in Spooks. Two of them were deaths from the seventh series. Adam Carter's death was voted the fourth most shocking, while Ben Kaplan's death was voted third. Connie's death however, was not listed. The featuring of an actual waterboarding scene drew criticism from Guardian columnist Zoe Williams, who wrote [...] "it's really unpleasant, [...] concurred.

60|$|We {{have had}} the most {{marvelous}} weather thus far, and have seen Paris better than ever I've seen it yet,--and to-day at the Louvre we saw the Casette of St. Louis, the Coffre of Anne of Austria, the porphyry vase, made into an eagle, of an old Abbé Segur, or some such name.

2500|$|In a Variety {{magazine}} interview, Julie Hanan Carruthers, {{executive producer}} of the show, spoke of Bianca's character development. She gave insight into the [...] "heart" [...] of the story. [...] "It was so successful," [...] she said. [...] "We did not tell a story about a lesbian. We told a story about a young girl coming out and her life around it. That was a big lesson to all of us here. It's really all about the story. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> people care on a human level, it's not sexual preference. It's about the human experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reed said that, of his roles, he {{probably}} loved Ko-Ko the most, noting, [...] "t's such {{fun to do}} ... you make people laugh, and the children and everybody enjoy him. And I suppose that's what our job is here anyway. To entertain people." [...] He also commented, [...] "Ko-Ko is almost me. There's a lot of me in the character. It lets me bring out my sense of humour. ... the character parts ... you must get your own personality through." [...] On the other hand, he said, [...] "Something takes over from me when I go on. I become something different. I'm basically shy, and I go and hide behind my characters." [...] Reed also loved to play Jack Point in Yeomen, a tragicomic character. [...] "Jack Point is me in another age – just a strolling player. I really believe I could die of a broken heart". Reed said that every comedian savours {{the chance to play}} a role like Point in which [...] "you like to see <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> 'em cry a little". He also noted that, generally, [...] "I like anything where the dancing comes in". His least favourite role was Major-General Stanley in Pirates, a role that he relinquished in 1969. He also found two drawbacks to playing King Gama: [...] "the heavy make-up ... hid every feature of his face except his eyes, and made it impossible for him to wear his glasses so that he could do his newspaper crossword while waiting to go on". Of the [...] "younger" [...] roles he played even in his later years with the company, Reed said, [...] "I feel I'm so fundamentally a young person. ... I'm older than the part I'm playing, for instance, but I feel young." [...] He loved performing for children and delighted in the gala [...] "last nights" [...] of each London season with the D'Oyly Carte, where he would perform for glittering audiences of [...] "Prime Ministers, Lord Chancellors and First Lords of the Admiralty." ...|$|E
