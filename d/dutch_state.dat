25|$|In May, Russell told William {{that the}} English {{opposition}} to James would not {{wait any longer}} for help and they would rise against James in any event. William feared {{that if he did}} not now head the conspiracy the English would set up a republic, even more inimical to the <b>Dutch</b> <b>state.</b> In June, William sent Count Zuylestein to England, ostensibly to congratulate James on the birth of the Prince of Wales but in reality to communicate with William's associates.|$|E
25|$|The {{exemptions}} lead {{to internal}} {{problems in the}} case of acquisition of Japanese or South Korean citizenship since neither Japan nor South Korea allows its nationals to hold foreign citizenships in their adult years. (See Japanese and South Korean nationality laws.) Of course, they are strictly Japanese/South Korean internal affairs and have to be solved by Japanese/South Korean citizens themselves, according to the laws of their own country. They are not problems of the <b>Dutch</b> <b>state,</b> and all that the Dutch laws say in this respect is that such Dutch subjects with dual nationality are allowed to renounce to their Dutch nationality.|$|E

25|$|In June 2014, the European Commission anti-trust {{regulator}} {{launched an}} investigation of the company's tax practices in the Netherlands, as part of a wider probe of multi-national companies' tax arrangements in various European countries. The investigation ended in October 2015, with the EC ordering Starbucks to pay up to €30 million in overdue taxes, which the EC regards as illegal state support for corporations. A pair of economists from the KU Leuven noted that the Commission did not forbid Starbucks' tax construction as such, pretending that Starbucks is a Dutch company and effectively rewarding the <b>Dutch</b> <b>state</b> for its lenient tax policy.|$|E
25|$|Appel {{made many}} other {{important}} contributions during the difficult {{years of the}} counter-revolution, up until World War II, against {{the positions of the}} degenerating Communist Parties, rapidly becoming bourgeois. The GIC worked in contact with other small revolutionary organisations in different countries (like the Ligue des Communistes Internationalistes in Belgium, the group around Bilan, Union Communiste in France, the group around Paul Mattick in the USA etc.), {{and was one of the}} most important currents of this period in keeping internationalism alive. From 1933 on Appel kept in the background, since the <b>Dutch</b> <b>state,</b> on good terms with Hitlerite Germany, would have expelled him. Until 1948, Appel remained in clandestinity under the name of Jan Vos.|$|E

In an interview in early 2007, Hirsi Ali noted that the <b>Dutch</b> <b>state</b> had spent about €3.5 million on her protection; threats against her produced fear, but she believed it important to speak her mind. While regretting van Gogh's death, she said she was proud of their work together.|$|E

25|$|Wars with Great Britain and France {{at the end}} of the 18th century, and {{attendant}} political upheavals, {{caused a}} financial and economic crisis from which the economy was unable to recover. After the successors of the Republic (the Batavian Republic and the Kingdom of Holland) were forced to engage in policies of economic warfare against the French Empire, which proved disastrous for Dutch trade and industry; most of the gains of the previous two centuries were rapidly lost. The newly independent Kingdom of the Netherlands was faced in 1815 with an economy that was largely deindustrialized and deurbanized, but still saddled with a crippling public debt, which it was forced to repudiate (the first time that the <b>Dutch</b> <b>state</b> defaulted since the dark pre-independence days of the Revolt).|$|E
25|$|On 28 June 1823, {{after only}} a few months in the Dutch East Indies, Siebold was posted as {{resident}} physician and scientist to Dejima, a small artificial island and trading post at Nagasaki, and arrived there on 11 August 1823. During an eventful voyage to Japan he only just escaped drowning during a typhoon in the East China Sea. As only {{a very small number of}} Dutch personnel were allowed to live on this island, the posts of physician and scientist had to be combined. Dejima had been in the possession of the Dutch East India Company (known as the VOC) since the 17th century, but the Company had gone bankrupt in 1798, after which a trading post was operated there by the <b>Dutch</b> <b>state</b> for political considerations, with notable benefits to the Japanese.|$|E

25|$|The {{news that}} Louis XIV had {{accepted}} Charles II's will {{and that the}} Second Partition Treaty was dead was a personal blow to William III, who had concluded that Philip V would {{be nothing more than}} a French puppet. However, in England many argued that the acceptance of Charles II's will was preferable to a treaty that would have extended French territory, including the addition of Naples and Sicily, which under French control would pose a threat to England's Levantine trade. After the exertions of the Nine Years' War the Tory-dominated House of Commons was keen to prevent further conflict and restore normal commercial activity. Yet to William III, France's growing strength made war inevitable, and together with Anthonie Heinsius, Grand Pensionary of Holland and de facto executive head of the <b>Dutch</b> <b>state</b> once William had been crowned King of England in 1689, he made preparations to gain support. To this end, William III was aided by Louis XIV's own actions, which fatally compromised the position of advantage the French king held.|$|E
500|$|The Centre Democrats opposed any {{limitation}} of {{the sovereignty of the}} <b>Dutch</b> <b>state</b> and was thus skeptical of the European Union and European integration, seeing the Maastricht Treaty as one of many international defeats inflicted on the Dutch government. While it generally described international organizations such as the United Nations as superfluous and inefficient bureaucracies, it supported NATO as a means of keeping the West safe from Communism. In its 1998 program, the Centre Democrats included a call for the [...] "reunification with Flanders and other Dutch-speaking territories", thereby promoting the idea of a Greater Netherlands.|$|E
500|$|The new {{constitution}} addressed {{many of the}} reformist concerns of the Patriots since 1785 (no hereditary offices; no sinecures; accountability of officials). It also came {{down on the side}} of economic liberalism (as opposed to mercantilism) in the economic debate then raging in republican circles (and therefore promised to do away with guilds and internal impediments to trade). The old provincial-repartition system of public finance was to be replaced by a system of national taxation. There was to be a five-man Uitvoerend Bewind as a collective Executive, with eight national Agenten (government ministers) doing the actual Administration work (Foreign Affairs, Police and Interior, Justice, Finance, War, Navy, National Education, and National Economy). Most importantly, as the British historian Simon Schama states: [...] "ts central aim was to change the nature of the <b>Dutch</b> <b>state</b> and to bind its new institutions into the framework of an electoral democracy." [...] As such it had an importance that outlasted the Batavian Republic and set up an ideal to emulate for its successor states.|$|E

5|$|Stanley and York's acts {{not only}} negated the gains of the 1586 campaign, but also {{undermined}} Leicester's reputation and the <b>Dutch</b> <b>States</b> {{confidence in the}} English troops. The <b>Dutch</b> <b>States</b> decided to appoint Count Maurice of Nassau as Governor-General of the Netherlands and Philip of Hohenlohe as his lieutenant. With the loss of Deventer and Zutphen's sconce, the Spanish were able to levy war contributions in the provinces of Utrecht, Overijssel and Gelderland. Zutphen and Deventer remained in Spanish control until their capture in 1591 by Maurice of Nassau.|$|R

500|$|Schimmelpenninck {{saw himself}} in the same light. He had long had a woolly vision of a [...] "national conciliation" [...] in the Netherlands, that made him {{amenable}} to a rapprochement with conservative and Orangist circles. These were to become his power base. Though Schimmelpenninck was a convinced federalist, he was a pliable character also. When Napoleon indicated that he preferred a centralized organization of the <b>Dutch</b> <b>state</b> (as the re-federalized model of the Staatsbewind had clearly not worked out), he {{did not hesitate to}} implement this in his project of a new constitution, that he constructed in the Summer of 1804 in consultation with the Staatsbewind. As a matter of fact, a delegation of the Staatsbewind, consisting of Schimmelpenninck, and members of the Regency Van der Goes (the former Agent) and Van Haersolte (a former Director), presented the case for this draft to Napoleon in November 1804. When the clash about the French customs men therefore took place later in the month, Napoleon came to a speedy decision and soon thereafter the Batavian Republic had a new constitution and government.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, the <b>Dutch</b> <b>state</b> {{earned a}} fortune with {{the sale of}} opium to the natives, this opium-trade was started centuries before during the VOC-times. At that time opium was the only known {{effective}} pain killer, and a considerable part of the natives was hooked on it, being kept poor in this way. This was called the [...] "opium-regime". To distinguish between smuggled and legal opium, a simple reagent was added. After discovery the smuggler could count on a severe punishment.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rejection}} of the dynastic claims of the House of Orange therefore {{was not just a}} matter of defending the political patronage of one particular political faction, against the aspirations to lucrative political office of another faction. It was a matter of principle to the States Party: they were against the notion of any [...] "eminent head" [...] of the <b>Dutch</b> <b>state,</b> not just the Prince of Orange. The absence of such an [...] "eminent head" [...] was to them a mark of superiority of the Dutch political system over other forms of government. The fact that compromise was a constant feature of the Dutch political landscape, and that often the pace of decision-making was glacial, was also viewed in a not necessarily negative light. (Besides, as was abundantly proved during the reign of William III, when he had obtained the stadtholdership after 1672, an [...] "eminent head" [...] did not necessarily eliminate the need for compromise, or speed up decision-making). Like his contemporaries as statesmen, such as Mazarin, De Witt was a raison d'état statesman, but his raison d'état had a different content. Unlike the princely version, his disdained territorial aggrandizement, military capability for its own sake, and concentration of power in the central state. Instead, he strove to ensure security of the <b>Dutch</b> <b>state,</b> its independence from outside interference, and advancement of its trade and industry, all elements being intended to benefit the society of which the regent class were the proper representatives. The Republic, in De Witt's view, sought to attain goals which were commensurate with the interests of its citizens, not in conflict with them, as the goals of absolutist rulers often were.|$|E

50|$|Overkirk {{was one of}} the Duke of Marlborough's {{most trusted}} generals, and led the left wing of Marlborough's army at both Ramillies and Oudenarde. He was made Field Marshal of the <b>Dutch</b> <b>States</b> Army in 1704.|$|R

2500|$|Though the Republic {{was only}} a small country, with a small {{population}} (about two million inhabitants when England had five million, and France already 20 million), these strategic drawbacks were more than compensated for by the economic and [...] financial might of the Republic. Uniquely in Europe in this age, the <b>Dutch</b> <b>state</b> was able to tap the already sophisticated Dutch capital market, {{without having to go}} through banking intermediaries, to finance emergency military spending by borrowing. At the same time the taxing capacity was sufficient to service the still-manageable public debt this engendered. In case of need, the Republic could therefore rapidly expand its standing army by hiring mercenaries in [...] "congenial" [...] markets, like Scotland, the Protestant Swiss Cantons, and sundry Protestant German principalities, foremost Prussia. This was most spectacularly demonstrated {{in the months leading up}} to the Dutch invasion of England in 1688, when the standing army was simply doubled in size by hiring Prussian troops. But it also applied during most of the period under consideration (though it failed miserably in 1672, as we will see).|$|E
2500|$|The Governor {{during this}} time {{was the head of}} {{government}} and was empowered to legislate, collect taxes, wage war and declare peace on behalf of the VOC and, by extension, the <b>Dutch</b> <b>state.</b> [...] Because the VOC was given diplomatic, administrative, judicial, and other functions of sovereignty, the Dutch legally exercised control over Taiwan. [...] During their rule, the Dutch made serious efforts in the development of Taiwan. They established laws concerning aspects of life such as the levying of import and export tariffs, the sale of lands, the construction of houses, the organization of markets, the production of alcohol and sugar, gambling, and the granting of permission to enter and live in aboriginal settlements. [...] The Dutch claimed they governed the whole island and created an administration and infrastructure that facilitated mostly commerce. [...] They introduced land management and cultivation schemes as well as zoning and required a 10 percent tax on all production within their zones. [...] They issued hunting licenses and taxed the subsequent catch. [...] They also required a tax for certain staples.|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea of the}} Luxembourg Summit {{was further}} {{elaborated}} at the European Council in Maastricht on 9–10 December 1991, a meeting to draft the Maastricht Treaty. The European Council agreed to create [...] "a European police office (Europol) the initial function {{of which would be}} to organize exchange of information on narcotic drugs". The Council likewise instructed TREVI ministers to take measures in setting up the office. On 7 February 1992, Europol was enshrined with more substance in Article K.1, section 9, as the Maastricht Treaty was signed: Member States shall regard the following areas as matters of common interest: [...] police cooperation for the purposes of preventing and combatting terrorism, unlawful drug trafficking and other serious forms of international crime, including if necessary certain aspects of customs cooperation, in connection with the organization of a Union-wide system for exchanging information within a European Police Office (Europol).Europol was first de facto organised provisionally in 1993 as the Europol Drugs Unit (EDU) in Strasbourg at the same site as the Schengen Information System was hosted. The small initial group started operations there in January 1994 under the leadership of Jürgen Storbeck and with a mandate to assist national police forces in criminal investigations. The competition for the permanent site of Europol during the period was between The Hague, Rome and Strasbourg—the European Council decided on 29 October 1993 that Europol should be established in The Hague. A former Catholic boys school built in 1910 at Raamweg 47 was chosen as the precise location. The house was used in World War II by police and intelligence agencies and after the War manned by the <b>Dutch</b> <b>State</b> Intelligence Service until Europol relocated there later in 1994.|$|E
