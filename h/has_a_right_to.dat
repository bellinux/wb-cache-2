5|$|Depending on the {{authorized}} {{and actual}} sentence, upon demand, a criminal defendant <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> trial by jury. The defendant {{does not have}} a right, conversely, to a bench trial without the consent of the prosecution. If the defendant is charged with crimes for which the authorized sentence exceeds six months, whether in state or federal court, the defendant <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> a jury. Further, the defendant <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> a trial by jury if the actual sentence exceeds six months and the charged crime has no maximum authorized sentence (e.g. contempt of court).|$|E

50|$|Broadly speaking, the United States has two {{parallel}} justice systems, with laws, statutes, precedents, rules of evidence, and paths for appeal. Under these justice systems prisoners have certain <b>rights.</b> They <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> know {{the evidence against}} them; they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> protect themselves against self-incrimination; they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> legal counsel; they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the witnesses against them cross-examined.|$|R

People of the Objectivist Party pursue [...] "rational egoism" [...] rather than altruism and believe {{that in order to}} act morally, one must pursue what makes them happy. The Objectivist Party also votes for a laissez-faire capitalism.|$|R

5|$|Multiple {{efforts to}} {{reschedule}} cannabis under the Act have failed, and the United States Supreme Court has ruled in United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative and Gonzales v.

5|$|Whether {{counsel is}} {{retained}} or appointed, the defendant <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> counsel without {{a conflict of}} interest. If an actual conflict of interest is present, and that conflict results in any adverse effect on the representation, the result is automatic reversal. The general rule is that conflicts can be knowingly and intelligently waived, but some conflicts are un-waiveable.|$|E

5|$|According to Christophe Jaffrelot, while Gandhi {{considered}} untouchability to {{be wrong}} and evil, he believed that caste or class are based neither on inequality nor on inferiority. Gandhi believed that individuals should freely intermarry whoever they want to, but no one should expect everyone to befriend them. Every individual regardless {{of his or her}} background, stated Gandhi, <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> choose who they welcome into their home, who they befriend and who they spend time with.|$|E
5|$|Voting is {{regarded}} as key to representative democracy, which requires that the leaders of a country are elected by the people. The basis of this concept is that everyone should be treated equally and everyone has equal rights. Every person, therefore, <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> one vote, and no more, {{in the choice of}} representatives. The right to vote is a primary right, a right of fundamental importance by which other rights are protected. It is one of the important bulwarks of a representative democracy and in this regard, the ballot box is the people's ultimate mechanism to control the shaping of government policies. However, it must be recognized that voting is not an infallible litmus test for democracy; rather, it functions as a procedural device that is normally regarded as the best instrument for securing the ideal of self-governance.|$|E
5|$|Whether counsel are {{appointed}} or retained, the Clause protects {{the role of}} counsel and certain attributes of the attorney-client relationship. For example, the Clause requires that the defendant be given time to consult with counsel and that counsel be given time to investigate the case pre-trial. And, the Clause also prohibits a state from barring a defendant from being cross-examined by counsel, or restricting {{the order in which}} the defendant may be called as a witness. Further, the court may not prevent a defendant from consulting with her counsel during an overnight recess, even if the recess bisects direct- and cross-examination of the defendant. Similarly, the defendant <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> have her counsel make a closing argument, even if a bench trial.|$|E

5|$|Negative {{perceptions}} of the Hinomaru exist in former colonies of Japan as well as within Japan itself, such as in Okinawa. In one notable example of this, on October 26, 1987, an Okinawan supermarket owner burned the Hinomaru {{before the start of}} the National Sports Festival of Japan. The flag burner, Shōichi Chibana, burned the Hinomaru not only to show opposition to atrocities committed by the Japanese army and the continued presence of U.S. forces, but also to prevent it from being displayed in public. Other incidents in Okinawa included the flag being torn down during school ceremonies and students refusing to honor the flag as it was being raised to the sounds of Kimigayo. In the capital city of Naha, Okinawa, the Hinomaru was raised for the first time since the return of Okinawa to Japan to celebrate the city's 80th anniversary in 2001. In the People's Republic of China and South Korea, both of which had been occupied by the Empire of Japan, the 1999 formal adoption of the Hinomaru was met with reactions of Japan moving towards the right and also a step towards re-militarization. The passage of the 1999 law also coincided with the debates about the status of the Yasukuni Shrine, US-Japan military cooperation and the creation of a missile defense program. In other nations that Japan occupied, the 1999 law was met with mixed reactions or glossed over. In Singapore, the older generation still harbors ill feelings toward the flag while the younger generation does not hold similar views. The Philippines government not only believed that Japan was not going to revert to militarism, but the goal of the 1999 law was to formally establish two symbols (the flag and anthem) in law and every state <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> create national symbols. Japan has no law criminalizing the burning of the Hinomaru, but foreign flags cannot be burned in Japan. Some people have humorously drawn an analogy between the Japanese flag and the appearance of a menstruation stain on a white bedsheet.|$|E

5000|$|The {{problem with}} telling someone that you <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> express {{yourself}} as angrily {{as you want}} to without them raising an objection is that you’re also inherently telling them that they don’t <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> be angry about the way you’re addressing them.
