25|$|Aerodynamic {{problems}} {{can also be}} classified according to whether the <b>flow</b> <b>speed</b> is below, near or above the speed of sound. A problem is called subsonic if all the speeds in the problem are less {{than the speed of}} sound, transonic if speeds both below and above the speed of sound are present (normally when the characteristic speed is approximately the speed of sound), supersonic when the characteristic <b>flow</b> <b>speed</b> is greater than the speed of sound, and hypersonic when the <b>flow</b> <b>speed</b> is much greater than the speed of sound. Aerodynamicists disagree over the precise definition of hypersonic flow; a rough definition considers flows with Mach numbers above 5 to be hypersonic.|$|E
25|$|Early {{studies have}} used the term stage to {{describe}} the possible states of feedback as shown schematically in the figure on the right. As the <b>flow</b> <b>speed</b> increases (Reynolds number, Re) the frequency slowly climbs (nearly constant Strouhal number, St) but then the frequency jumps up abruptly to a higher stage. As the <b>flow</b> <b>speed</b> is later decreased the frequency slowly decreases but then jumps down abruptly to a lower stage. This pattern is called a hysteresis loop.|$|E
25|$|The <b>flow</b> <b>speed</b> of a fluid can be {{measured}} using a device such as a Venturi meter or an orifice plate, which can be placed into a pipeline to reduce {{the diameter of the}} flow. For a horizontal device, the continuity equation shows that for an incompressible fluid, the reduction in diameter will cause an increase in the fluid <b>flow</b> <b>speed.</b> Subsequently, Bernoulli's principle then shows that there must be a decrease in the pressure in the reduced diameter region. This phenomenon is known as the Venturi effect.|$|E

25|$|The above {{equations}} suggest {{there is}} a <b>flow</b> <b>speed</b> at which pressure is zero, and at even higher speeds the pressure is negative. Most often, gases and liquids are not capable of negative absolute pressure, or even zero pressure, so clearly Bernoulli's equation ceases to be valid before zero pressure is reached. In liquids – when the pressure becomes too low – cavitation occurs. The above equations use a linear relationship between <b>flow</b> <b>speed</b> squared and pressure. At higher flow speeds in gases, or for sound waves in liquid, the changes in mass density become significant so that the assumption of constant density is invalid.|$|E
25|$|One {{important}} source of instability in a fluid {{is the presence of}} a velocity gradient or shear layer with an inflection point.

25|$|At any {{particular}} <b>flow</b> <b>speed</b> {{it is possible}} for one of several loops to be dominant, depending on how that speed was achieved.

25|$|That {{this change}} in the {{pressures}} (and hydraulic heads), just {{before and after the}} pipe expansion, corresponds with an energy loss becomes clear when comparing with the results of Bernoulli's principle.

40|$|The rate {{at which}} a passive {{suspension}} feeder captures food particles depends on the {{rate at which}} ambient currents bring particles into contact with its feeding apparatus. This flux of particles is controlled in part by the turbulence and velocity of water as it moves over a surface of a given topography, and is thus strongly influenced by {{the size and shape of}} an organism, and by the size and spatial distribution of neighboring individuals. The effects of (1) colony size and (2) the presence of conspecific neighbors on particle capture rates were quantified in laboratory experiments conducted with colonies of an undescribed species of alcyonacean soft coral. Soft coral colonies were observed feeding in a recirculating flow tank at freestream <b>flow</b> <b>speeds</b> ranging from 0. 04 - 0. 51 m/s. At all experimental <b>flow</b> <b>speeds,</b> per polyp particle capture rates decreased as colony size increased. At low <b>flow</b> <b>speeds,</b> colonies had lower particle capture rates when surrounded by neighboring colonies than when neighbors were absent; however, at high <b>flow</b> <b>speeds,</b> particle capture rates were enhanced slightly in the presence of neighboring colonies. These alcyonacean colonies, as well as other colonial organisms in diverse taxa, undergo continual asexual fission as they grow, thereby forming aggregations of small, physiologically discrete daughter colonies. The results obtained here suggest that this growth strategy may be an effective means of maximizing nutrient intake (hence growth rate and sexual reproductive potential) per unit biomass of the genotype. The experimental results can be used to predict the size at which a colony should undergo fission in a given flow environment in the absence of other selective forces acting on colony size...|$|R

25|$|The first {{number is}} {{the ratio of}} {{unsteady}} inertial forces to steady inertial forces. The number was {{named in honor of}} Vincenz Strouhal who first deduced the relationship between the vortex shedding frequency around a cylinder and the <b>flow</b> <b>speed.</b> The characteristic variables were the cylinder diameter L1, and the speed of the flow over it U. He found the number to be reasonably constant over given a Reynolds number range.|$|E
25|$|As a flow in {{a channel}} becomes supersonic, one {{significant}} change takes place. The conservation of {{mass flow rate}} leads one to expect that contracting the flow channel would increase the <b>flow</b> <b>speed</b> (i.e. making the channel narrower results in faster air flow) and at subsonic speeds this holds true. However, once the flow becomes supersonic, the relationship of flow area and speed is reversed: expanding the channel actually increases the speed.|$|E
25|$|Aerodynamic {{problems}} are classified by the flow environment or {{properties of the}} flow, including <b>flow</b> <b>speed,</b> compressibility, and viscosity. External aerodynamics {{is the study of}} flow around solid objects of various shapes. Evaluating the lift and drag on an airplane or the shock waves that form in front of the nose of a rocket are examples of external aerodynamics. Internal aerodynamics is the study of flow through passages in solid objects. For instance, internal aerodynamics encompasses the study of the airflow through a jet engine or through an air conditioning pipe.|$|E
40|$|Daugaard Jensen Gletscher, Greenland, {{is a large}} tidewater glacier {{terminating}} in {{the northwest}} corner of the Scoresby Sund fjords. We present a time series of surface <b>flow</b> <b>speeds</b> spanning 1985 - 2010 based on feature tracking of satellite images. The time series confirms that <b>flow</b> <b>speeds</b> remained stable and reveals a persistent summer acceleration of up to 10 % over the lower 10 km of the glacier. The front of the 6 km floating tongue fluctuates by little more than the average size of calved icebergs, 1 km. While we are unable to detect any imbalance between ice discharge and surface mass balance within our error estimates, observations suggest that the region is losing mass and experiencing decreases in surface elevation. We conclude that as <b>flow</b> <b>speeds</b> and surface mass balance have remained steady since 1985, the shift from balance to imbalance, leading to elevation decrease, must have occurred prior to this date. As for other stable Greenland tidewater glaciers, the seasonal melt cycle is the dominant influence on flow velocity variation but, if the apparent current thinning rates continue, there is potential for the grounding line to retreat, for calving rates to increase and for the glacier to accelerate...|$|R

40|$|Investigations on {{the special}} {{flushing}} conditions with an electrical discharge drilling machine were done to analyze single discharges.

Under a dielectric flushing the removed material on the tool electrode is less than on the workpiece. If the volume flow is high enough, the whole plasma channel is pushed {{in the direction of the}} flow.

25|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{is dependent upon}} the initial fluid speed. If the initial speed of the fluid is below the critical speed, then no jump is possible. For initial flow speeds which are not significantly above the critical speed, the transition appears as an undulating wave. As the initial <b>flow</b> <b>speed</b> increases further, the transition becomes more abrupt, until at high enough speeds, the transition front will break and curl back upon itself. When this happens, the jump can be accompanied by violent turbulence, eddying, air entrainment, and surface undulations, or waves.|$|E

The value of D in the figure represents the ratio of the lateral disturbance displacement to the nozzle width; the disturbances were minute.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe capture {{efficiency}} and feeding behaviour of the cold-water coral (CWC) Lophelia pertusa (Linnaeus, 1758) were investigated considering: (1) different food types, (2) different food sizes and (3) different current speeds and temperatures. This study used two different multifactorial experimental approaches: (1) Corals {{were subjected to}} three different <b>flow</b> <b>speeds</b> (2, 5 and 10 cms− 1) in 5 l volume tanks, and three different food types (alive zooplankton, alive algae, and dry particulate organic carbon) were offered to the corals under each current regime, analysing the capture rates of the corals under these different flow velocities. (2) In a flume, the feeding behaviour of the coral polyps was studied under different current speed regimes (1, 7, 15 and 27 cms− 1) and a temperature change over a range of 8 – 12 °C. The obtained results confirm that low <b>flow</b> <b>speeds</b> (below 7 cms− 1) appear optimal for a successful prey capture, and temperature {{did not have an}} effect on polyp expansion behaviour for L. pertusa. In conclusion, <b>flow</b> <b>speeds</b> clearly impact food {{capture efficiency}} in L. pertusa, with zooplankton predominantly captured prey at low flow velocities (2 cms− 1) and phytoplankton captured at higher flow velocities of 5 cms− 1. This split in capture efficiency may allow corals to exploit different food sources under different tidal and flow conditions...|$|R

25|$|Hydrodynamic {{feedback}} (Class I) {{influences the}} formation of new vortices and exerts a fluctuating force on the cylinder. The flow field {{is shown in the}} upper figure on the right (created by Gary Koopman). Theodor von Karman identified and analyzed the flow behind objects like a cylinder and since then this special flow has been called the Karman vortex street. Vincenz Strouhal was the first to scientifically investigate the sound emitted by flow around a rigid cylinder. At low Reynolds numbers the tone was pure and the frequency was proportional to the steady <b>flow</b> <b>speed</b> U and inversely proportional to the cylinder diameter d.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the theory}} of aerodynamics, a flow is {{considered}} to be compressible if the density changes along a streamline. This means that – unlike incompressible flow – changes in density are considered. In general, this is the case where the Mach number in part or all of the flow exceeds 0.3. The Mach 0.3 value is rather arbitrary, but it is used because gas flows with a Mach number below that value demonstrate changes in density of less than 5%. Furthermore, that maximum 5% density change occurs at the stagnation point (the point on the object where <b>flow</b> <b>speed</b> is zero), while the density changes around the rest of the object will be significantly lower. Transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic flows are all compressible flows.|$|E
25|$|The axis of {{rotation}} itself precesses around the pipe axis resulting in a rotating force at the pipe exit and results in a rotating dipole sound field. Studies of this whistle have shown that dynamic similarity based on the pipe diameter d as the characteristic length scale, and inlet mean <b>flow</b> <b>speed</b> U as the characteristic speed was not achieved, {{as shown in the}} lower figure on the right. A more correct speed would be that characteristic of the swirl fd, where f is the precession (and sound) frequency, based on the Rossby number. To test the relevance of this new characteristic speed, the flow rate was increased and the frequency and level of the sound was measured. Using the dipole model, the calculated force was found to be nearly proportional to (fd)2, confirming the correctness of the new characteristic speed.|$|E

40|$|Industrial {{design and}} {{optimization}} processes rely increasingly on powerful and well-engineered CFD tools. Compressible solution methods, which perform {{very well at}} transonic and supersonic <b>flow</b> <b>speeds,</b> display a dramatic degradation of convergence {{as well as of}} solution quality as the incompressibility limit is approached (very low <b>flow</b> <b>speeds).</b> In many technical applications, especially in turbomachinery, the flow conditions vary strongly within the computational domain and with time. When the incompressibility limit is approached, a large disparity arises between the smallest and largest eigenvalues of the systems characteristic matrix. In order to overcome these problems low-Mach preconditioning methods have been devised to rescale the eigenvalues of the characteristic matrix of the system of governing equations and, hence, reduce the large inequality in the acoustic and convective <b>flow</b> <b>speeds.</b> Frequently, low <b>flow</b> <b>speeds</b> are observed in low Reynolds environments. As noted by several authors, often instability issues in these regions, such as cavities and boundary layers, arise by preconditioning. Often, this problem is due to an overestimation of the maximum allowable timestep size. In fact, in a low Reynolds regime, the influence of viscous effects on time marching schemes predominates. An important role in the determination of viscous time steps plays the von Neumann number (VNN), whereas the Courant Friedrichs Lewy criteria (CFL) influences the inviscid time step behaviour. The objective of this work is the presentation of the theoretical background and results of a consistent Low-Mach preconditioning scheme based on a preconditioner proposed by Turkel, which has been extended {{to a wide range of}} Reynolds numbers. Furthermore, the interaction of low-Mach preconditioning, the von Neumann and Courant Friedrichs Lewy numbers on the convergence history and quality of results will be discussed. Its implementation is illustrated using DLR’s in-house CFD code TRACE. To prove the robustness and correctness of the algorithm, we discuss a set of test cases like the lid-driven cavity at different Reynolds numbers influenced by CFL and VNN...|$|R
