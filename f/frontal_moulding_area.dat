40|$|The {{emission}} of microbial {{volatile organic compounds}} (MVOC) underlies many different influences. Aim {{of this study was}} to analyze the reproducibility of MVOC production by a mould strain by retesting. We also searched for differences between wild strains and strains from certified collections. 3 wild strains and 2 certified strains of each Penicillium brevicompactum, Aspergillus versicolor, Eurotium amstelodami and Chaetomium globosum were analyzed. The mould species were cultivated on ingrain wallpaper. Samples were taken on Tenax TA® and analyzed by GC/MS. Unsteadiness in the MVOC production of a mould strain during retesting could be demonstrated and also certain variability between the strains of one genus. In addition, a clear variability of the MVOC production between different mould genera could be observed. No differences between wild- and certified strains have been found. Overall very low emission rates could be detected. For example, by a <b>mould</b> <b>area</b> of 0, 25 m² and a room volume of 50 m³, only in very small cases the technical detection limit would have been reached.

40|$|Tribological {{parameters}} are dependent upon inter alia, inner component properties which may {{vary with the}} temperature-time behaviour of the polymer melt used. This temperature-time behaviour can be influenced by dynamic mould temperature control. The present paper presents a new dynamic tempering concept, which enables a targeted temperature-time control via shifting a mould cavity within two different tempered <b>mould</b> <b>areas</b> at a defined point in time.

To show the influence of inner component properties on tribological parameters, pin-on-disc wear tests are performed. Furthermore, tribological tests with different surface topographies are performed to show the influence of topographical properties on tribological parameters. Results indicate that the tribological properties of microparts are mainly influenced {{by the nature of the}} skin near layers, which can be influenced by the application of different mould temperatures.

40|$|We have {{performed}} dissections of two diamondiferous eclogites (UX- 1 and U 33 / 1) from the Udachnaya kimberlite, Yakutia {{in order to}} understand the nature of diamond formation and the relationship between the diamonds, their mineral inclusions, and host eclogite minerals. Diamonds were carefully recovered from each xenolith, based upon high-resolution X-ray tomography images and three-dimensional models. The nature and physical properties of minerals, in direct contact with diamonds, were investigated at the time of diamond extraction. Polished sections of the eclogites were made, containing the <b>mould</b> <b>areas</b> of the diamonds, to further investigate the chemical compositions of the host minerals and the phases that were in contact with diamonds. Major- and minor-element compositions of silicate and sulfide mineral inclusions in diamonds show variations among each other, and from those in the host eclogites. Oxygen isotope compositions of one garnet and five clinopyroxene inclusions in diamonds from another Udachnaya eclogite (U 51) span the entire range recorded for eclogite xenoliths from Udachnaya. In addition, the reported compositions of almost all clinopyroxene inclusions in U 51 diamonds exhibit positive Eu anomaly. This feature, together with the oxygen isotopic characteristics, is consistent with the well-established hypothesis of subduction origin for Udachnaya eclogite xenoliths. It is intuitive to expect that all eclogite xenoliths in a particular kimberlite should have common heritage, at least with respect to their included diamonds. However, the variation in the composition of multiple inclusions within diamonds, and among diamonds, from the same eclogite indicates the involvement of complex processes in diamond genesis, at least in the eclogite xenoliths from Yakutia that we have studied...|$|R

40|$|In a {{foundry casting}} line, {{contaminants}} are {{released from a}} large area. Casting fumes include both volatile and particulate compounds. The volatile fraction contains hydrocarbons, whereas the particulate fraction mostly comprises a mixture of vaporized metal fumes. Casting fumes lower the air quality in foundries. The design of local ventilation for the casting area is a challenging task, {{because of the large}} casting area and convection plumes from warm moulds. A local ventilation solution for the <b>mould</b> casting <b>area</b> was designed and dimensioned with the aid of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) calculations. According to the calculations, the most efficient solution was a push–pull ventilation system. The prototype of the push–pull systemwas built and tested in actual operation at the foundry. The push flow was generated by a free plane jet that blew across the 10 m wide casting area towards an exhaust hood {{on the opposite side of}} the casting lines. The capture efficiency of the prototype was determined by the tracer gas method. The measured capture efficiencies with push jet varied between 40 and 80 %, depend-ing on the distance between the source and the exhaust. With the aid of the push flow, the average capture efficiency was increased from 40 (without jet) to 60 %...|$|R
40|$|Participation of {{superoxide}} anion and hydroxyl radical {{as well as}} lipoxygenase (LOX) activity and chemiluminescence {{in the development of}} grey mould on poinsettia leaves of the cvs. : Coco White - moderately resistant and Malibu Red - susceptible to Botryotinia fuckeliana (B. cinerea) were investigated. In both poinsettia cultivars, the level of {{superoxide anion}} radical increased with the disease development. On later dates following inoculation, the content of O 2. - in the diseased leaf areas of the susceptible cultivar was 2 - fold larger than in grey <b>mould</b> symptom <b>areas</b> of the moderately resistant cultivar. The postinfection generation of a strongly reactive hydroxyl radical was found in the cultivar susceptible to the pathogen. The level of. - OH in the last hours afier inoculation was 10 fold higher in grey mould spots than in healthy senescing leaves of that cultivar. Tlie activity of LOX exhibited opposite tendencies of changes in the both genotypes examined after the infection. In the first hours after inoculation, the enzyme activity was Low, whereas after 3 rt day it significantly increased in diseased leaf areas and in their surroundings. However, in the moderately resistant cultivar the activity of lipoxygenase thoughout the first 3 days of the disease activity was relatively high and then decreased. Poinsettia leaves infected with B. cinerea emitted chemiluminescence. Kinetics and the intensity of ultraweak chemiluminescence depended on the cultivars of poinsettia and on the degree of the disease development. The postinfection increase of chemiluminescence was particularly visible in the zone surrounding diseased areas in the susceptible cultivar...|$|R
40|$|A well {{designed}} runner and feeding system should produce castings with minimal defects and low pour weight. This thesis investigates how the filling regime and solidification of the mould influences defects in the castings produced from that mould. Design guidelines to reduce such defects are proposed and tested. An existing shrinkage fault in a Grey Iron disc brake casting is simulated using a commercial finite-difference computer program. Three criteria {{are used to}} predict the defect {{and the effect of}} changes to the feeder geometry. Critical Fraction Solidification analysis is used to determine whether the feeder remains in liquid contact with the casting during solidification and this approach is shown to correctly predict {{the presence or absence of}} porosity* The feeder block is extended below the ingate of the casting to improve liquid contact between the casting and feeder without significantly increasing the feeder mass. Plant trials confirm the change to the feeder eliminates the porosity defect. The runner system and mould venting for a thin walled Ductile Iron casting are investigated. Trials show that by setting the total <b>mould</b> vent <b>area</b> to be greater than the net ingate area of the castings, the cold-shut frequency is halved. A method for runner system design based on peak linear flow velocity in the runner during mould filling is proposed. A new pressurised runner system produces castings with significantly fewer defects and reduced pour weight when runner areas are designed to maintain peak velocity below 1 m/s. Peak velocity and magnesium levels are demonstrated to be critical factors in the elimination of cold-shut defects. A pressurised runner system is also shown to isolate inclusion defects from castings more effectively than an unpressurised system. From this work, a technique is proposed which allows the yield of an existing runner and feeder system for iron castings to be improved with confidence in the results...|$|R
5|$|Injection {{moulding}} machines {{consist of}} a material hopper, an injection ram or screw-type plunger, and a heating unit. Also known as platens, they hold the moulds in which the components are shaped. Presses are rated by tonnage, which expresses the amount of clamping force that the machine can exert. This force keeps the mould closed during the injection process. Tonnage can vary from less than 5 tons to over 9,000 tons, with the higher figures used in comparatively few manufacturing operations. The total clamp force needed {{is determined by the}} projected area of the part being <b>moulded.</b> This projected <b>area</b> is multiplied by a clamp force of from 1.8 to 7.2 tons for each square centimetre of the projected areas. As a rule of thumb, 4 or 5 tons/in2 can be used for most products. If the plastic material is very stiff, it will require more injection pressure to fill the mould, and thus more clamp tonnage to hold the mould closed. The required force can also be determined by the material used {{and the size of the}} part. Larger parts require higher clamping force.|$|R
40|$|Continuous caster moulds are {{the last}} and most {{important}} stage in the steelmaking process, where inclusions can either be generated or removed. With increasing casting speed using conventional immersion nozzles critical problems, such as unstable bulk mould flow have been noticed. Mould flux entrapment due to vortex and shearing action from the oscillating surface waves have become of particular concern. It is therefore necessary to have a calm inlet flow {{at the entrance of}} the mould. Recently, it has been acknowledged that a swirl blade placed at the upstream of the immersion nozzle effectively resolves the problems arising from unstable bulk mould flow. Therefore, to increase the knowledge of effect of swirling flow on the flow pattern in the mould, fundamental mathematical models of a billet mould equipped with a swirl blade in the nozzle have been developed. The model was used to study the effect of divergent angle of the immersion nozzle and mould aspect ratio on the flow field and temperature distribution inside billets moulds. Data from water model experiments were used to verify the mathematical model predictions. A fairly good agreement was found between physical modeling data and predictions, which ensured that the numerical model is reliable. Thereafter, the differences between square and round billet moulds were studied. Next, the effect of changing aspect ratio of the rectangular mould on the fluid flow and heat transfer, while keeping <b>mould</b> surface <b>area</b> constant, was studied. Two types of immersion nozzles, bottomless and conventional, were also analyzed during the research. The model moulds were changed gradually from a square billet with an aspect ratio of 1 x 1 to a rectangular billet with an aspect ratio of 3 x 1. First, the temperature and velocity distributions were calculated. Later, unsteady calculations were done to determine velocity fluctuations on the meniscus level for two types of nozzles and several moulds geometries. QC 20101110 </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Mould</b> {{in stock}} <b>areas</b> is a severe problem for both {{libraries}} and archives. Micro organisms not only affect the material but also endanger the employees' and users' health. This paper presents {{an overview of}} the living conditions of micro organisms and of the state-of-the-art of conservation and restoration methods of mouldy library material. A short description of illnesses caused by mould and advice for health care is given as well. A review of the literature revealed the vital climatic conditions to prevent stored library material from micro organisms. These conditions are described in interaction with different materials (paper, parchment and photographs) and the nutritional requirements of mould. The empirical part of this paper was planned to be based on interviews with librarians and restaurateurs to give an insight of how libraries and archives in Vienna deal with the mould problem. It had to be libraries and archives that had the restoration facilities of their own. Interviews were conducted with Dr. Erna Pilch-Karrer (head of the restoration department of the Austrian State Archive) and Mag. Christa Hofmann (head of the restoration department of the Austrian National Library). The main outcome of the interviews is that conservation methods to prevent mould are more economical than the restoration of mouldy materials. The interviews also revealed that from over 200. 000 species of micro organisms, only between 30 and 40 usually occur in libraries and archives. By describing precautions and treatments for stored library material, librarians and archivists concerned with this topic find an introduction to relevant literature and a starting point for choosing a method for their own use...|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} Continuous Casting (CC) {{products}} are highly {{connected to the}} flow of the liquid metal and injected argon inside the mould. Therefore, both physical and numerical modelling has been performed to investigate the metal flow inside the CC mould. A physical model has been used for investigating the flow inside the mould. Therefore, it uses a re-circulating technique along with a Bi-Sn alloy for representing the liquid steel. Moreover, velocity measurements using a Vives electromagnetic probe have been carried out where typical CC flow structures such as jet, upper and lower rolls were found. Overall, good contact between the metal and the Vives probe was achieved. The experiments showed that argon bubbles were possible to both count and classify using a high-speed camera with a framing rate of 500 frames per second. Almost 45 % of the bubbles were discovered in the middle region of the mould (20 % of the <b>mould</b> top surface <b>area,</b> central plane parallel to the wide faces). It was also found that the nozzle was misaligned. Levels of both alloy and the covering silicone oil were measured simultaneously using a Light beam sensor, which measured both levels at high accuracy. The usage of argon made the oil dirty, which in time made impossible to measure the level using the Light beam sensor. Argon bubbles along with a thin silicone oil layer were numerical modelled using a Discrete Phase Model combined with a Volume Of Fluid in a three dimensional model. This was solved using ANSYS Fluent 14. 5. 7. The fluid flow fields give streamlines that allows for further investigating of the flow patterns inside the model. In addition to these, more quantities can be post-processed for investigating different features of the flow. Also, bubbles were counted and it was shown that almost 50 % of the bubbles were released within the middle region of the mould. Validerat; 20140613 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
