5|$|Afternoon winds usually <b>die</b> <b>down</b> in the evening, {{prompting}} behavioral {{modifications in}} the herd. The deer avoid the dry wind by being more active {{at night when}} the wind is not blowing. In 1991 there was a three-year average of 420 mule deer.|$|E
5|$|No {{news about}} the game was made {{available}} for 18 months after it was initially announced. Davis thought the game was announced too early, causing excitement for it to <b>die</b> <b>down</b> {{too far from the}} release date. The developers carried out focus tests during this period, and the gameplay was found to be too slow-paced compared to competitors such as Call of Duty. As a result, the team spent time to speed up the game's action so that it would more closely match the narrative.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{underwater}} flow is pillow lava, a circular lava flow named after its unusual shape. Less common are glassy, marginal sheet flows, indicative of larger-scale flows. Volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks {{are common in}} shallow-water environments. As plate movement starts to carry the volcanoes away from their eruptive source, eruption rates start to <b>die</b> <b>down,</b> and water erosion grinds the volcano down. The final stages of eruption caps the seamount in alkalic flows. There are about 100,000 deepwater volcanoes in the world, although most are beyond the active stage of their life. Some exemplary seamounts are Loihi Seamount, Bowie Seamount, Davidson Seamount, and Axial Seamount.|$|E
60|$|Strangely enough, incredulity <b>died</b> <b>down,</b> and <b>died</b> <b>down</b> very quickly. A subtle wave {{filled the}} murky {{atmosphere}} compelling every mind to belief, {{long before the}} man's assertions were proved to be correct. The most indifferent became conscious of an overwhelming conviction that the witness was speaking the truth.|$|R

5|$|The {{effects of}} wind shear finally took their toll late on January 4, and Zeta's {{convection}} began to <b>die</b> <b>down.</b> This led to Tropical Storm Zeta weakening to a minimal tropical storm. The NHC continued to overestimate how quickly Zeta would dissipate and early on January 5 they operationally downgraded Zeta to a depression, which was later confirmed {{to have been}} an error. Zeta continued to move west-northwestward, barely holding on to tropical storm status before becoming disorganized again. Zeta weakened into a tropical depression on January 6 and dissipated into a remnant later that day. With this transition, the very active 2005 hurricane season finally came to a close. The remnant low retained its identity for a further day before it dissipated 660miles (1060km) southeast of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|Tim Folger {{speculates that}} news of radio {{contact with an}} {{extraterrestrial}} civilization would prove impossible to suppress and would travel rapidly, though Cold War scientific literature on the subject contradicts this. Media coverage of the discovery would probably <b>die</b> <b>down</b> quickly, though, as scientists began to decipher the message and learn its true impact. Different branches of government (for example legislative, executive, and judiciary) may pursue their own policies, potentially giving rise to power struggles. Even {{in the event of}} a single contact with no follow-up, radio contact may prompt fierce disagreements as to which bodies have the authority to represent humanity as a whole. Michaud hypothesizes that the fear arising from direct contact may cause nation-states to put aside their conflicts and work together for the common defense of humanity.|$|E
5|$|Buckingham Palace finally {{became the}} {{principal}} royal residence in 1837, on the accession of Queen Victoria, {{who was the}} first monarch to reside there; her predecessor WilliamIV had died before its completion. While the state rooms were a riot of gilt and colour, the necessities of the new palace were somewhat less luxurious. For one thing, it was reported the chimneys smoked so much that the fires had to be allowed to <b>die</b> <b>down,</b> and consequently the court shivered in icy magnificence. Ventilation was so bad that the interior smelled, and when it was decided to install gas lamps, there was a serious worry about the build-up of gas on the lower floors. It was also said that staff were lax and lazy and the palace was dirty. Following the Queen's marriage in 1840, her husband, Prince Albert, concerned himself with a reorganisation of the household offices and staff, and with the design faults of the palace. The problems were all rectified by the close of 1840. However, the builders were to return within the decade.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the series}} of battles around Baykand, the Turgesh retired north to Samarkand, where they {{assaulted}} the fortress of Kamarja, while Ashras with his troops besieged Bukhara and wintered in its oasis. Warfare did not <b>die</b> <b>down,</b> however, and the Arabs' situation remained precarious: when, in early 730, Ashras' newly appointed successor Junayd ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Murri tried to reach the army, which was still encamped in the Bukhara oasis, {{he had to be}} escorted from Amul by 7,000 cavalry who were attacked on the way by the Turgesh and almost destroyed. Although Bukhara was recovered by the Arabs at this time, either under Ashras or under Junayd, in the very next year the latter led the Khurasani army to disaster in the Battle of the Defile, an event which shattered the tenuous Arab control over what remained of their possessions in Transoxiana. The Arabs were not able to recover their position until the governorship of Nasr ibn Sayyar, who in 739–741 managed to re-establish the Caliphate's authority up to Samarkand.|$|E

25|$|The {{controversy}} was {{a momentous}} incident in Jewish {{history of the}} period—involving both Yechezkel Landau and the Vilna Gaon—and may be credited with having crushed the lingering belief in Sabbatai current even in some Orthodox circles. Rabbi Dr. Sid Z. Leiman claims that the mentioned great Rabbis exonerated Eybeschutz from Sabbatianism only in order that the controversy should <b>die</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although {{this new}} site allowed the {{controversy}} to <b>die</b> <b>down,</b> the statue was not well-sheltered. Soon after its relocation, it was ripped off its pedestal by a devastating tropical cyclone {{known locally as}} the cyclone of 1948. Thrown to the ground a second time, it lay abandoned, face-down, for twenty years until the place was refurbished: in 1968, communal workers rediscovered it intact under grasses and construction debris.|$|E

25|$|In 2004 he {{announced}} his retirement from international cricket. This was due largely to the dispute between the rebels and the Zimbabwean Cricket Union. He {{signed a contract with}} Essex as a Kolpak player where he would play alongside his brother Andy. There was some grumbling amongst Essex supporters at his signing, but this appeared to <b>die</b> <b>down</b> after his first season, when he topped the Essex 2005 List-A batting averages and was third in the number of wickets taken.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the ensuing}} decades there was {{considerable}} political tension between the eastern and the western halves of the Cape Colony. The Eastern Cape, from its major port and urban centre Port Elizabeth, resented being ruled from Cape Town in the Western Cape and frequently agitated to become a separate colony. These separatist tensions did not completely <b>die</b> <b>down</b> until the 1870s when Prime Minister John Molteno restructured the Cape administration to meet the major eastern concerns and, in the Constitutional Amendment Bill of 1873, abolished the last formal distinctions.|$|E
25|$|However, the Patagonian giant frenzy was to <b>die</b> <b>down</b> {{substantially}} only a {{few years}} later, when some more sober and analytical accounts were published. In 1773 John Hawkesworth published on behalf of the Admiralty a compendium of noted English southern-hemisphere explorers' journals, including that of James Cook and John Byron. In this publication, drawn from their official logs, {{it became clear that the}} people Byron's expedition had encountered were no taller than , very tall but by no means giants. Interest soon subsided, although awareness of and belief in the myth persisted in some quarters even up into the 20th century.|$|E

25|$|Newspapers {{were nearly}} silent while the Court {{conducted}} its proceedings. While bickering with Johnson, the Court first published its judgment of guilt of Denmark Vesey and five black slaves, and announced sentencing them to death. The six men were executed by hanging on July 2; {{none of the}} six had confessed and each proclaimed his innocence to the end. Their deaths quieted {{some of the city}} residents' fears, and the tumult in Charleston about the planned revolt began to <b>die</b> <b>down.</b> Officials made no arrests in the next three days, as if wrapping up their business.|$|E
25|$|Scientists discredited the {{eugenics}} movement after {{witnessing the}} events of World War II and the acts committed by the Nazis {{in the name of}} genetic cleansing. Forced sterilization was declared a crime against humanity in the Nuremberg Trials. While sterilization programs began to <b>die</b> <b>down</b> in the United States and Great Britain, they continued in Canada's western provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan. Notably, it was only in Alberta that a sterilization law had been vigorously implemented. By order of the Alberta Eugenics Board, Muir and 2,831 children and adults were sterilized between the passing of the Sexual Sterilization Act in 1928 and its repeal in 1972.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} the {{fighting}} on 19 September, 75th Division and the rest of XXI Corps were left on salvage work and road repair until the Armistice with the Turks was signed on 31 October. Demobilisation began early in 1919, but 75th Division was selected for the Army of Occupation of Palestine. In March 1919 it returned to garrison duty in Egypt, becoming responsible for the Eastern Delta, which was renamed 75th Division Area. Many other units were attached for this work. After July 1919 the disturbances in Egypt began to <b>die</b> <b>down,</b> and units began to disperse to their home countries. On 1 April 1920 the Division Area and remaining troops were handed over to 10th (Irish) Division and 75th Division ceased to exist.|$|E
