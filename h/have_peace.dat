The Fourth Macedonian War, 150 to 148 BC, was fought against a Macedonian pretender to the throne who was again destabilizing Greece by trying to re-establish the old kingdom. The Romans swiftly defeated the Macedonians at the Second battle of Pydna.|$|E

Bradley Stern from MuuMuse stated that the clip was [...] "absolutely gorgeous" [...] despite its simplistic concept; he enjoyed the appearance of a Newton's cradle {{in the beginning of the}} video, and felt that it represented the lyrics [...] "you can't <b>have</b> <b>peace</b> without a war" [...] by exemplifying that the concept that [...] "for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction".

[...] Though he was a childhood friend of Hashirama amidst the conflicts of their respective clan, their friendship ends {{as a result of the}} war. As the leader of the Uchiha clan, Madara's overuse of Mangekyo Sharingan blinds him, forcing him to take the eyes of his late younger brother Izuna. This allows Madara to use his newly awakened Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan to continue the ongoing war between the Uchiha and the Senju. In later years, Hashirama comes forth with a peace offering between the two clans. Though he agrees to <b>have</b> <b>peace</b> with his former rival, Madara feels he would never be accepted by the Senju and loses hope in Hashirama. While working towards this goal, Madara captures Kurama the Nine-Tails and uses him in a scheme to destroy Konoha. Madara is believed to have been killed by Hashirama's hand, but he survives and goes into hiding while taking a blood sample of Hashirama with him to awake his Rinnegan. During this time, Madara takes Obito Uchiha as his agent and transplants his Rinnegan into Nagato to be preserved for his eventual revival years later.|$|E

500|$|In 1948, MacArthur made {{a bid to}} win the Republican {{nomination}} to be the GOP candidate for president, which was the most serious of several efforts he made over the years. MacArthur's status as one of America's most popular war heroes together with his reputation as the statesman who had [...] "transformed" [...] Japan gave him a strong basis for running for president, but MacArthur's lack of connections within the GOP were a major handicap. MacArthur's strongest supporters came from the quasi-isolationist, Midwestern wing of the Republicans and embraced men such as Brigadier General Hanford MacNider, Philip La Follette, and Brigadier General Robert E. Wood, a diverse collection of [...] "Old Right" [...] and Progressive Republicans only united by {{a belief that the}} U.S. was too much involved in Europe for its own good. MacArthur declined to campaign for the presidency himself, but he privately encouraged his supporters to put his name on the ballot. MacArthur had always stated he would retire when a peace treaty was signed with Japan, and his push in the fall of 1947 to have the U.S sign a peace treaty with Japan was intended to allow him to retire on a high note, and thus campaign for the presidency. For the same reasons, Truman subverted MacArthur's efforts to <b>have</b> <b>peace</b> treaty signed in 1947, saying that more time was needed before the U.S could formally make peace with Japan.|$|E

Fans from outside the former Yugoslavia described Sarajevo as [...] "an oasis of light" [...] in the midst of destroyed and fire-damaged buildings, and deserted villages. Despite the subpar performance, the Associated Press said, [...] "For two magical hours, the rock band U2 achieved what warriors, politicians and diplomats could not: They united Bosnia." [...] Andrew Mueller of The Independent wrote, [...] "For {{the first time since the}} start of the war in 1992, people more accustomed to seeing each other through the sights of a rifle were converging on the capital to listen to music together. It was a reminder of prewar Sarajevo, home to some of old Yugoslavia's best rock bands." [...] Sacirbey stated that he was satisfied that the concert [...] "was held to promote a sense of normalcy, peace and reconciliation in Sarajevo and not to raise money."

Meanwhile, dozens of members of Ugandan diaspora in United States protested outside the Invisible Children offices in San Diego, also criticizing the video but saying Kony represents [...] "only three percent of all the problems" [...] in their home country and lambasting the Ugandan government for its inadequate response to Kony's terror and other issues.|$|E
