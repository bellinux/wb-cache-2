40|$|Objective To {{identify}} {{patterns of}} <b>distress</b> among mothers {{of children with}} cancer over the initial 6 months of treatment and to examine these patterns as predictors of child somatic and emotional <b>distress.</b> Method Data were gathered regarding maternal perceived stress and affective <b>distress</b> from mothers of children (N = 65, mean age = 8. 3 years) with cancer at 2 to 5 weeks postdiagnosis, then at 12 to 14 weeks and 22 to 24 weeks. Mothers and nurses provided indexes of child somatic and emotional <b>distress</b> at these assessments. Results Hierarchical and k-means cluster analyses revealed four distinct patterns of maternal distress: high, moderate, declining, and low. The high maternal <b>distress</b> group reported higher child emotional <b>distress</b> at all three points but higher child somatic <b>distress</b> only at the final assessment. Maternal <b>distress</b> group was unrelated to nurse-reported child <b>distress.</b> Conclusions The identification of four empirically derived patterns of maternal <b>distress</b> may {{explain some of the}} variance in the literature regarding parental <b>distress</b> vis-Ã -vis pediatric cancer treatment and may have relevance to intervention efforts. Differences in the relations between maternal <b>distress</b> groups and mother- and nurse-reported child <b>distress</b> underscore the importance of collecting child <b>distress</b> data from multiple sources...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Heightened {{psychological}} <b>distress</b> after {{cancer is}} common but likely highly heterogeneous. This raises potential challenges in {{how and when}} to target services; however, data describing longitudinal patterns of <b>distress</b> are limited. This study describes the long term psychological outcomes for colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors and trajectories of adjustment over time. Methods: A prospective survey of a population-based sample of 1966 CRC survivors assessed sociodemographic ariables, perceived social support and psychological <b>distress,</b> including <b>distress</b> subtypes of anxiety, depression and somatization, at six time points from 5 months to 5 years postdiagnosis. Results: Over the 5 -year trajectory, the prevalence of high overall <b>distress</b> ranged between 44 % and 32 % but was greater for men compared with women (p < 0. 001). Four <b>distress</b> trajectory styles within clusters were identified for overall <b>distress</b> and for each <b>distress</b> subtype with a constant low <b>distress</b> group provi ing the basis for comparison. Higher <b>distress</b> trajectories varied for overall <b>distress</b> and <b>distress</b> subtypes but were generally differentiated by gender, younger age, lower education, poor socioeconomic advantage, late disease stage and poor social support. Conclusions: For global <b>distress,</b> by comparison with women, men with CRC are vulnerable to <b>distress,</b> with men who are younger and with low education and poor social support being a priority for targeted intervention. While <b>distress</b> screening early in t e cancer experience will identify those with a constant high <b>distress</b> trajectory, others with late emerging <b>distress</b> or caseness may be missed. On this basis, <b>distress</b> screening through the illness trajectory into long term survivorship seems warranted...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to provide empirical tests of some of the mechanisms thought to operate in mindfulness-based treatments. Specifically, I tested the hypothesis that appraising <b>distress</b> judgmentally (as a needless and useless indication of personal weakness) would be associated with experiencing meta-distress (e. g., feeling ashamed about being <b>distressed),</b> which would, in turn, be associated with increased experiential avoidance (i. e., suppression or distraction from the <b>distress)</b> and shorter <b>distress</b> tolerance. In addition, I examined the hypothesis that compassionately appraising <b>distress</b> (as normal, understandable, and potentially a source of growth) would be associated with spending more time curiously exploring that <b>distress</b> and thereby be associated with being able to tolerate <b>distress</b> for longer periods of time. Finally, I examined the prediction that compassionately appraising <b>distress</b> would be associated with even greater curious exploration and <b>distress</b> tolerance than viewing <b>distress</b> from a distanced perspective (as a passing mental event), which is often taught along side or as a prerequisite for compassionate appraisal. One-hundred-sixty-seven psychologically healthy college students and members of the academic community at a large Mid Southern University underwent a series of <b>distress</b> inductions and were told to either simply monitor their level of <b>distress</b> (Awareness), judgmentally appraise <b>distress</b> (Judgment), maintain a distanced perspective from <b>distress</b> (Distancing), or compassionately appraise <b>distress</b> while also maintaining a distanced perspective (Compassion). As expected, some support was found for the hypothesis that compassionately appraising <b>distress</b> was associated with greater curious investigation of <b>distress,</b> if not longer <b>distress</b> tolerance. Moreover, compassionately appraising <b>distress</b> was associated with greater curious investigation than simply viewing <b>distress</b> from a distanced perspective, but only for the idiographic sadness induction. Hypotheses regarding the impact of judgmental appraisal could not be fairly evaluated in the present study, as it appeared that the judgment manipulation failed to sufficiently alter behavior...|$|R

Disorganized attachment has been considered a major risk factor for child psychopathology, as it appears to interfere with regulation or tolerance of negative emotions and may thus foster aggressive behavior. Disorganized patterns of attachment have the strongest links to concurrent and subsequent psychopathology, and considerable research has demonstrated both within-the-child and environmental correlates of disorganized attachment.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To examine {{predictors}} of short- and medium-term psychological morbidity (<b>Distress)</b> among Chinese women following breast cancer surgery. Method: Three hundred and three Chinese women were interviewed at 1 week (baseline), 1, 4 and 8 months following surgery. Participants were assessed for baseline <b>Distress</b> (Chinese Health Questionnaire- 12) and completed a retrospective assessment of treatment decision making (TDM) difficulties, treatment outcome expectations {{and satisfaction with}} TDM involvement. Perceived treatment outcome, <b>Distress,</b> optimism, perceived self-efficacy (SE), and physical symptom <b>distress</b> (PSD) were assessed at each follow-up. Stepwise multivariate regression examined impact of TDM-related and other factors on <b>Distress</b> over time after adjustment for clinical and treatment differences. Results: At baseline, 38 % of women had mild, and 40 % moderate/severe <b>Distress.</b> Outcome expectation, TDM difficulties and SE predicted baseline CHQ 12 scores (adjusted R 2 =. 312). <b>Distress</b> declined significantly over follow-up assessments (p<. 001). At one-month post-surgery (adjusted R 2 = 0. 59) <b>Distress</b> was predicted by PSD (p<. 001), baseline <b>Distress</b> (p<. 001), Expectancy-Outcome incongruence (p<. 001), and over-involvement in TDM (p=. 003). Three-months post-surgery <b>Distress</b> (adjusted R 2 = 0. 52) was predicted by one-month post-surgery <b>Distress</b> (p<. 001), PSD (p<. 001), Expectancy-Outcome Incongruence (p=. 001), and low SE (p<. 001). <b>Distress</b> at eight-months post-surgery (adjusted R 2 = 0. 52) was predicted by one-month post-surgery <b>Distress</b> (p<. 001), PSD (p<. 001), and low optimism (p<. 001).

Methods: The participants were 1079 women {{with breast cancer}} who were recruited between April 2013 and May 2014 from 11 breast surgery departments in Denmark. <b>Distress</b> was evaluated using the <b>Distress</b> Thermometer (DT) and predictors of <b>distress</b> were assessed with a self-administered questionnaire {{at the time of}} diagnosis (T 1), at discharge (T 2), and by the start of adjuvant treatment or follow-up (T 3). Repeated measures ANOVA, simple and multiple linear regression, and mixed effects regression models were used to identify predictors and estimate changes in <b>distress.</b> Results: At T 1, 249 (24. 3 %) women reported no or minimal <b>distress,</b> 298 (29. 1 %) moderate <b>distress,</b> and 407 (39. 8 %) severe <b>distress.</b> The mean <b>distress</b> was 5. 5 points on the DT, which decreased by 0. 70 (95 % confidence interval (CI) â 0. 80, â 0. 54) points from T 1 to T 3.

We examined whether the risk of self-reported psychological <b>distress</b> becomes progressively higher the longer the history of <b>distress</b> and whether prolonged history of <b>distress</b> modifies associations between risk markers and future <b>distress.</b> Participants were British civil servants from the prospective Whitehall II cohort study (n= 7934; 31. 5 % women, mean age 44. 5 years at baseline) followed from 1985 to 2006 with repeat data collected in 7 study phases. Psychological <b>distress</b> was assessed with the 30 -item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ).

40|$|This paper studies thirty-one highly {{leveraged}} transactions (HLTs) of the 1980 s that subsequently became financially <b>distressed.</b> At {{the time of}} <b>distress,</b> all sample firms have operating margins that are positive and {{in the majority of}} cases greater than the median for the industry. Therefore, we consider these firms financially <b>distressed,</b> not economically <b>distressed.</b> The net effect of the HLT and financial <b>distress</b> is a slight increase in value [...] from pre-transaction to <b>distress</b> resolution, the sample firms experience a marginally positive change in (market- or industry-adjusted) value. This finding strongly suggests that, overall, the HLTs of the late 1980 s succeeded in creating value. We also present quantitative and qualitative estimates of the (direct and indirect) costs of financial <b>distress</b> and their determinants. Our preferred estimates of the costs of financial <b>distress</b> are 10 % of firm value. Our most conservative estimates do not exceed 23 % of firm value.

5|$|Attachment {{disorder}} {{is a broad}} term intended to describe disorders of mood, behavior, and social relationships arising from a failure to form normal attachments to primary care giving figures in early childhood. Such a failure would result from unusual early experiences of neglect, abuse, abrupt separation from caregivers between 6 months and three years of age, frequent change or excessive numbers of caregivers, or lack of caregiver responsiveness to child communicative efforts resulting in a lack of basic trust. A problematic history of social relationships occurring after about age three may be <b>distressing</b> to a child, but does not result in attachment disorder.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This study {{aimed to}} assess the impact on physicians' {{detection}} of patients' and relatives' <b>distress</b> of six 3 -h consolidation workshops (CW) following a 2. 5 -day communication skills basic training (BT) program and to investigate factors associated with detection of <b>distress.</b> Methods: Physicians, after BT, were randomized to CW or to a waiting list. Physicians' detection of patients' and relatives' <b>distress</b> was measured through differences between physicians' ratings of patients' and relatives' <b>distress</b> (VAS) and patients' and relatives' self-reported <b>distress</b> (HADS). Communication skills were analysed according to the CRCWEM. Results: Mixed-effects modelling of physicians' detection of patients' <b>distress</b> showed a positive group by time effect in favour of physicians in the CW group. Detection of patients' <b>distress</b> was associated negatively with patients' <b>distress,</b> positively with physicians' concurrent use of psychological assessment and supportive skills, and negatively with general assessment skills. Mixed-effects modelling of physicians' detection of relatives' <b>distress</b> showed no significant group by time effect.

5|$|A {{site for}} the London {{terminus}} near Waterloo had been suggested by Richard Broun. Its proximity to the Thames meant that bodies could be cheaply transported to the terminus by water from much of London, while being situated near three major Thames bridges the area was easily accessed from both {{north and south of}} the river. The arches of the huge brick viaduct carrying the LSWR into Waterloo Bridge station (now London Waterloo station) were easily converted into mortuaries.

40|$|Context: Anxiety and <b>distress</b> {{regarding}} {{dental treatment}} {{is a major}} issue for dental patients and can be exaggerated in pediatric dental patients. Aims: The aim was to investigate how different methods of induction for general anesthesia affect childrenâ²s <b>distress</b> for dental procedures such as extraction of teeth. Subjects and Methods: This was an observational clinical study conducted at Manchester University Dental Hospital. The induction of anesthesia in children was achieved with either intravenous (I.

Statistical Analysis Used: There were {{statistically significant differences between}} the mean <b>distress</b> scores for the I. V. and inhalation groups (P values from independent t-test: P < 0. 001) was applied. Results: In gaseous induction group, the number of children who scored severe and very severe <b>distress</b> was greater than those who were in I. V. group. Gaseous induction was used for 23 children. Preoperatively, 56. 5 % children were in very severe <b>distress,</b> 17. 4 % in severe <b>distress,</b> 13 % in moderate <b>distress,</b> 8. 7 % in mild <b>distress</b> and only one (4. 3 %) showed no <b>distress.</b> For I.

There {{was no significant difference between}} both induction methods in terms of <b>distress</b> levels at the time of recovery and 15 min postoperatively...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} to address the {{estimation}} of financial <b>distress</b> costs including the deterioration in asset value. A sample of 104 TAIEX-listed financially <b>distressed</b> companies was collected covering the period from 1998 to 2004. As expected, {{it is found that}} the TAIEX-listed financially <b>distressed</b> companies have registered a huge reduction in stock price. Moreover, as expected, it is found that the financial <b>distress</b> costs of the "delisting" group are largest, the financial <b>distress</b> costs of the "maintaining normal trading" group are lowest, and the financial <b>distress</b> costs of the "cash transaction only/suspended trading" group fall somewhere in between. Based on the empirical findings, the present study concludes that the magnitude of financial <b>distress</b> costs is substantially underreported in the literature as a result of ignoring deterioration in asset value.

40|$|Objective: Several {{practice}} guidelines recommend routine {{screening for}} psychological <b>distress</b> in cancer care. The {{objective was to}} evaluate the effect of screening cancer patients for psychological <b>distress</b> by assessing the (1) effectiveness of interventions to reduce <b>distress</b> among patients identified as distressed; and (2) effects of screening for <b>distress</b> on <b>distress</b> outcomes. Methods: CINAHL, Cochrane, EMBASE, ISI, MEDLINE;PsycINFO, and SCOPUS databases were searched through April 6, 2011 with manual searches of 45 relevant journals, reference list review, citation tracking of included articles, and trial registry reviews through June 30, 2012. Articles in any language on cancer patients were included if they (1) compared treatment for patients with psychological <b>distress</b> to placebo or usual care in a randomized controlled trial (RCT); or (2) assessed the effect of screening on psychological <b>distress</b> in a RCT. Results: There were 14 eligible RCTs for treatment of <b>distress,</b> and 1 RCT {{on the effects of}} screening on patient <b>distress.</b> Pharmacological, psychotherapy and collaborative care interventions generally reduced <b>distress</b> with small to moderate effects. One study investigated effects of screening for <b>distress</b> On psychological outcomes, and it found no improvement Conclusion: Treatment studies reported modest improvement in <b>distress</b> symptoms, but only a single eligible study was found on the effects of screening cancer patients for <b>distress,</b> and <b>distress</b> did not improve in screened patients versus those receiving usual care. Because of the lack of evidence of beneficial effects of screening cancer patients for <b>distress,</b> it is premature to recommend or mandate implementation of routine screening.
