5|$|After Crisis Cores release, Kitase {{expressed}} {{surprised at}} {{the quality of the}} cutscenes, to the point where <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> could almost be a PlayStation 2 game. He also enjoyed the game's ending, surprised by how moving Zack's story became.|$|E
5|$|As {{a popular}} physician, Sonnabend was renowned for {{protecting}} and promoting patients' rights. He did not {{shy away from}} criticising the scientific establishment when <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was failing to put patients' interests first. He often disagreed with mainstream opinion on AIDS.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1962 season, Shaughnessy {{tendered}} {{his resignation}} with a year remaining on his contract. He expressed regret in his departure and admiration for Halas, but said that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was time for a change.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> nodded. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>it</b> {{was useless}} to combat her resolution.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>felt</b> for <b>it</b> in the {{darkness}} and gave a thundering rat-tat-tat at the door.|$|R
50|$|While {{writing for}} IGN in Italy, Di Claudio Chianese {{described}} Sons of Abraham as {{building on the}} solid foundation formed by the original game. But <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> like <b>it</b> didn't go far enough in {{the expansion of the}} religions, and missed out on the chance to play as the Pope. But <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>it</b> would be well received by experienced gamers of Crusader Kings II.|$|R
5|$|Maben {{subsequently}} {{did some}} of the editing of the final cut at home, due to financial constraints. He regretted doing this, as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was important to separate his work and home life, but, at the time, he had no choice.|$|E
5|$|The {{dialogue}} between Sharon and Randy that would provoke significant attention was not scripted until Tuesday morning, less than 48 hours prior to broadcast, {{and was one}} of the last completed parts of the show. Parker likened the scene to an afterthought, as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was not necessarily central to the episode's story.|$|E
5|$|The early 20th {{century was}} {{the era of the}} Great Migration of blacks from the Southern United States to the Northeast, Midwest and West. Du Bois wrote an {{editorial}} supporting the Great Migration, because <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> would help blacks escape Southern racism, find economic opportunities, and assimilate into American society.|$|E
60|$|He stopped, for <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>it</b> was unmanly, {{as well as}} idle, {{to boast}} in the circumstances.|$|R
60|$|At this Ham Spink's eyes brightened. He was {{not above}} telling an untruth when <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> like <b>it.</b>|$|R
60|$|Kiki hesitated, but saw {{no reason}} to deny <b>it.</b> <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>it</b> would make him appear more important.|$|R
5|$|The {{title of}} the album was drawn from the book Brooklyn Follies by Paul Auster, which Fanning had read during the recording. He stated {{the concept of the}} title related to escapism, and that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> an {{appropriate}} sentiment to attach to the music of the album.|$|E
5|$|Brooker {{had other}} ideas that {{were removed from}} the {{original}} script because they would be complicated to do. He said he could use these ideas in a sequel story which would involve the main character finding messages that she had left for herself on previous days as the process of erasing her mind starts to not function. However, as the location for the episode no longer exists, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> would be more practical to create a graphic novel instead of recreating the scenario.|$|E
5|$|Despite its toxicity, T.floccosus {{is one of}} the ten wild {{mushrooms}} most widely consumed by ethnic tribes in Meghalaya, northeast India, and is highly regarded by the Sherpa people in the vicinity of Sagarmatha National Park in Nepal. What is not known is whether the Indian populations of T.floccosus are nontoxic, or whether the local people have developed an immunity to it. It is also enjoyed in Mexico. American mycologist David Arora reported that some enjoyed it while <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> had a strong sour taste.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Hardy {{acknowledged}} {{to himself that}} the Solicitor-General pleaded his own case very well; but yet <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>it</b> wasn't law.|$|R
60|$|Dane {{understood}} what lay behind this, and <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>it</b> {{was the last}} thing under the circumstances he would think of doing.|$|R
5|$|Donald Fagen of Steely Dan has {{favored the}} sound of the Rhodes over the Wurlitzer Electric Piano, because <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was a {{technically}} superior instrument. Steely Dan has featured the Rhodes in almost all of their albums after 1975, and Fagen has also used the Rhodes in all of his solo albums and continues to play it at every one of his touring performances since 1994.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Puerto Rican-American {{recording}} artist La India covered the song on her album, Dicen Que Soy which {{was produced by}} Sergio George and released as the album's first single. It was picked by George for India to cover as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was something women could relate to. India's version was included on the soundtrack for The 24 Hour Woman.|$|E
5|$|At first, Schwarzkopf was {{ambivalent}} {{during the}} run-up to the Iraq War in 2003. He initially endorsed an invasion after Colin Powell's presentation to the United Nations on February 6, 2003. When weapons of mass destruction were not located in the country after the invasion, he changed his stance. He was critical of the lack of a reconstruction plan after the fall of Baghdad, feeling the initial offensive operations plans did {{not take into account the}} cultural complexities of Iraq. In 2004, he was critical of Donald Rumsfeld and his handling of Operation Iraqi Freedom. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was a mistake to send U.S. Army Reserve troops into the country without adequate training.|$|E
60|$|Marston made {{a sign of}} agreement. His head ached and <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> languid. <b>It</b> was {{possible}} he had a mild dose of fever.|$|R
60|$|She sighed. Her {{eyes seemed}} to have wandered away. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>it</b> was a trick to avoid looking at him for the moment.|$|R
60|$|Hawtrey let the jibe pass. For one thing, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>it</b> was warranted, {{and just}} then his anxiety was {{too strong for}} anger.|$|R
5|$|In August 1968, in an {{interview}} to Rolling Stone, Townsend talked about a new rock opera, which had the working title of Deaf, Dumb and Blind Boy, and described the entire plot in great detail, which ran to 11 pages. Who biographer Dave Marsh subsequently said the interview described the narrative better than the finished album. Townshend later regretted publishing so much detail, as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> forced him to write the album according to that blueprint. The rest of the Who, however, were enthusiastic about the idea, and let him have artistic control over the project.|$|E
5|$|Madsen's {{idea was}} to bring {{attention}} {{to the story of}} Flammen and Citron as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> had been neglected or misrepresented. The most expensive Danish film produced to that date, it was co-produced by German companies because initially there was no interest in producing the film in Denmark. Portraying the protagonists as morally ambiguous characters, the director tried to depict war as a complicated experience that goes beyond a good versus evil dichotomy. With visual and narrative references borrowed from film noir and the French film Army of Shadows, Flame & Citron also explores themes of love, betrayal, and the emotional aspects of relationships.|$|E
5|$|Shadrick {{enrolled}} in Pineville High School in 1947 and received top marks in his classes. During {{his sophomore year}} in 1948, he developed an interest in football and made the school's team, though he was small for his age. The team could not afford uniforms, and Shadrick's father gave him five dollars to buy one, but it was stolen from his locker in October 1948. The incident upset Shadrick so much {{he dropped out of}} school, reportedly refusing to return from that day forward. One month later, he and a friend enlisted in the U.S. Army. Shadrick's father would later refer to the stolen school uniform as the reason Shadrick enlisted in the military, and said <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> indirectly caused his son's death.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>it</b> {{would be}} useless cruelty to resist that appeal. There was no merciful {{alternative}} but to answer it on the spot.|$|R
60|$|The page had no pretence for {{avoiding}} the conference which the chaplain thus offered, though <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>it</b> might prove an embarrassing one.|$|R
50|$|Later, Merckx {{said that}} his {{decision}} {{to stay in the}} Tour after he broke his cheekbone was stupid. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>it</b> cut his career short.|$|R
5|$|Ste told Amy's father Mike to {{look after}} Lucas and Leah in the {{aftermath}} of the baby plot because he didn't think he was a good father. Richardson reported that he enjoyed working with Jude and Jessica Croft-Lane, the young actors who played Lucas and Leah. He reported that Jude was camera shy and liked to play with camera equipment during filming and that he told Croft-Lane that his name was actually Ste. Richardson concluded the storyline was different and <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> gave him a chance to showcase his acting abilities.|$|E
5|$|Tome of the Unknown is a {{short film}} {{directed}} by Patrick McHale, who also wrote and storyboarded it. Not long after he graduated college, McHale pitched {{the idea for the}} film, among other concepts, to Cartoon Network. At the time, the network was considering the creation of a department for feature films, though this never came to fruition. McHale was asked if it was possible to adapt the idea for Tome of the Unknown to feature length. This proved unsuccessful as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> needed to be episodic, laying out plans for a full television series consisting of three seasons.|$|E
5|$|After {{being unable}} to win the {{previous}} running of the 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps, Dumas said that Porsche had to be focused, remain calm, and ensure that the team did not make any mistakes. Brendon Hartley, driving the No. 1 Porsche vehicle, said he {{was looking forward to}} racing the circuit because it is one of his favourite tracks and <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> would be a good race for him and his team-mates. He also felt that his defence of the World Drivers' Championship would be revived at the track following his disqualification from the Silverstone event. Toyota No. 5 car driver Anthony Davidson said that the race would give them an indication of the segments that needed focus on before heading to Le Mans and was looking forward to competing at Spa-Francorchamps. Having missed the previous year's running of the event due to injury, Kazuki Nakajima was pleased to return to the circuit and felt that the race would be better than Silverstone.|$|E
50|$|Shibli Nomani and Allama Iqbal {{influenced}} Siraji. Like them, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>it</b> {{was necessary}} to harmonise religious and secular thought to awaken the Indian Muslim community.|$|R
60|$|The {{kneeling}} policeman was proffering {{the bottle}} once more. Mr. Buffin snatched at <b>it.</b> <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>it</b> {{was just what}} at that moment he needed most.|$|R
60|$|Oswald was silent. From {{the tales}} {{he had heard}} of the ferocity of these dreaded marauders, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>it</b> was more than {{probable}} that his uncle was right.|$|R
