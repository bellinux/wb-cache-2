5|$|Referring to this period, John Martyn (who in 1973 {{wrote the}} title song of his album Solid Air for and about Drake) {{described}} him as the most withdrawn person he <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met.</b> He would borrow his mother's car and drive for hours without purpose on occasion, until {{he ran out of}} petrol and had to ring his parents to ask to be collected. Friends have recalled the extent to which his appearance had changed. During particularly bleak periods of his illness, he refused to wash his hair or cut his nails. Early in 1972, Drake had a nervous breakdown, and was hospitalized for five weeks.|$|E
25|$|Christopher Hitchens {{referred}} to Francis Collins as a 'Great American' {{and stated that}} Collins {{was one of the}} most devout believers he <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met.</b> He further stated that Collins was sequencing the genome of the cancer that would ultimately claim Hitchens's life, and that their friendship despite their differing opinion on religion was an example of the greatest armed truce in modern times.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the book, Graystripe, feeling {{torn between}} loyalties, heavy-heartedly decides to join RiverClan in order to raise Silverstream's kits. Fireheart {{attempts}} to have him reconsider, but this later proves to be unsuccessful. Fireheart is left heartbroken with the thought of losing his friend with whom he shared many adventures, and was the first Clan cat he <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> since his days as a kittypet. He believes he will be lonely without his best friend.|$|E

25|$|Zubeidi's father, Muhammad, {{had been}} an English teacher, but was {{prevented}} from teaching by the Israelis after {{he was convicted of}} Fatah membership in the late 1960s. He worked instead as a labourer in an Israeli iron foundry, did some private teaching on the side, and became a peace activist. The first Israeli Zubeidi <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> was the soldier who came to take away his father for alleged membership of Fatah. His father died of cancer, leaving Zubeidi's mother Samira to raise their eight children alone.|$|E
25|$|Both {{countries}} {{had a successful}} World Cup in 1966, and met in the final played at Wembley on Saturday, 30 July 1966. This {{was and still is}} regarded by many as the most important match ever played between the two teams, and it was also the first time they <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> in a competitive game, as opposed to the friendly matches they had played before. It was also a highly eventful and in some respects controversial game, which created the modern rivalry between the teams.|$|E
25|$|Nadia {{left the}} House on Day 95, {{after she was}} given framed photos of her time in the House. She was given the {{opportunity}} to record a goodbye message, similar to what housemates up for eviction do every week. She started the message by saying she hated all the housemates and that they were the worst people she <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met,</b> then left the screen. After a short while, she returned on screen and said that was a practical joke, and that she loved everybody really.|$|E

25|$|In 1962, Arye Oded, an Israeli {{studying}} at Makerere University, visited the Abayudaya and met Samson Mugombe. This {{was the first}} time the Abayudaya <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> an Israeli and the first Jew they had met since Yosef. Oded had many long interviews with Mugombe and other leaders and explained to them how Jews in Israel practised Judaism. Oded then wrote a book ("Religion and Politics in Uganda,") and numerous articles on the community and their customs which introduced them to world Jewry. The community underwent a revival in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772–1834) was a poet, philosopher, {{literary}} critic, and theologian {{who was a}} {{major force}} behind the Romantic movement in England. No single person had meant more to Hazlitt's development as a writer than Coleridge, who {{changed the course of}} Hazlitt's life on their meeting in 1798. Afterwards at odds over politics, they became estranged, but Hazlitt continued to follow the intellectual development of one who answered more closely to his idea of a man of genius than anyone he <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met,</b> as he continued to chastise Coleridge and other former friends for their abandonment of the radical ideals they had once shared.|$|E
25|$|RUC Special Patrol Group officer John Weir named Hanna, {{along with}} senior UVF member Robin Jackson and Davy Payne (UDA Belfast), as having led {{one of the}} two teams that bombed Dublin on 17 May 1974. Weir {{additionally}} alleged that Hanna had been the main organiser of the attacks. Weir did not join the Glenanne gang until after Hanna's death; so it was highly unlikely that they <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met.</b> Weir maintained he had received the information of Hanna's central role in the Dublin bombings from James Mitchell. His allegations were published in 2003 in the Barron Report, which was the findings of the official investigation into the bombings by Irish Supreme Court Justice Henry Barron.|$|E

25|$|In 1906, Machen {{joined the}} Princeton Seminary as an {{instructor}} in the New Testament, after receiving an assurance {{that he would}} not have to sign a statement of faith. Among his Princeton influences were Francis Landey Patton, who had been the prosecutor in a nineteenth-century heresy trial, and B. B. Warfield, whom he described as the greatest man he <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met.</b> Warfield maintained that correct doctrine was the primary means by which Christians influenced the surrounding culture. He emphasised a high view of scripture and the defence of supernaturalism. It appears that under their influence Machen resolved his crisis of faith. In 1914, he was ordained and the next year he became an Assistant Professor of New Testament studies.|$|E
25|$|William Maloney, who was {{a medical}} doctor, wrote in his 1936 book The Forged Casement Diaries of the {{whispering}} campaign in 1916 performed as a contagious disease infecting people with doubt and confusion and this is recognized by Casement's biographers. This being the case, Casement's prosecutor, Lord Chancellor (Smith), showed the diaries to Michael Collins in 1922 with the same purpose and knowing from personal experience that, once infected, Collins would inevitably transmit the infection to his government colleagues in Dublin, only one of whom allegedly <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> Casement. Collins' uncertainty {{would have been enough}} to dissuade others from pursuing such a distasteful matter. But this would explain why senior officials of the Irish State have always remained ambivalent with regard to the enduring controversy over the authenticity of these highly incriminating documents.|$|E
25|$|Higgins had a poor 2011/2012 season, {{reaching}} {{only two}} quarter finals of major ranking events. His season-best performance was reaching the semi-finals of the Masters, where he lost 4–6 to Shaun Murphy. Before {{the start of}} his World Championship title defence, he admitted that his performance levels had not been good enough and that he had not been trying hard enough, managing just one or two days of practice a week. In {{the first round of the}} tournament, he came from 6–8 down to defeat Liang Wenbo 10–9. He then played Stephen Hendry in the second round, the first time the two players <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> in a World Championship, but Hendry thrashed the defending champion 13–4, with Higgins calling it the worst he had ever played at the Crucible. He finished the season ranked world number five.|$|E

25|$|Martínez Salinas, on {{the other}} hand, stated that {{he was forced to}} confess because he was a {{neighbor}} at Santa Elena and driver of the Hernández family. He said he had been beaten and taken to the ranch where he was told to pose with the exhumed bodies. When asked if he <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> Constanzo, he stated that he had seen him in person at the ranch with the Hernándezes but never talked to him. Martínez Salinas said he was arrested one afternoon at Elio's in-law's house when {{he was looking for a}} car piece for his vehicle. He said he had known Aldrete years before, since he had dated one of her sisters when he was young. He said that he had never heard Aldrete talk about the cult. He said she had talked about her school and marriage. He also said that Elio and Ovidio never invited him to the cult or talked to him about it.|$|E
25|$|Uhura recognizes Curate Prime as Gary Mitchell, {{a friend}} of James T. Kirk, who had been granted {{formidable}} mental power after passing through the galactic barrier forty years earlier. Insanely believing himself a living god, Mitchell was defeated by Kirk in the real timeline; in the altered timeline, with Kirk not there to stop him, Mitchell was able to kill {{the captain of the}} Enterprise – in this case, Christopher Pike – and take control of the United Federation of Planets, refounding it as the Galactic Order. As they escape into the ship, a fleet of Kittrick's allies, led by Captain Galt (Herbert Jefferson, Jr.) of the free ship Liberty, engages the Conqueror, with Curate Prime leading a fleet of his own to destroy Kittrick and his rebellion. While Chekov and Harriman take control of the Conqueror, Uhura transports to the surface. Mitchell follows her, believing her to be Chekov/Kittrick, and tortures her, demanding his location. Charlie Evans steps in to protect her, using his Thasian-granted powers to battle the godlike Mitchell. Beaten, Mitchell transports Janice Rand (Grace Lee Whitney) – the first woman Evans <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met,</b> when he was taken aboard the Enterprise – to distract him, letting off one last burst of energy before escaping to his flagship. Angered and weakened, Mitchell orders the firing of his ship's Omega device, which will destroy both the captured Conqueror and the planet.|$|E

500|$|Having {{left the}} government, Hugill also left the Social Credit caucus, and served {{the rest of}} his term as an independent. [...] He joined the People's League, a {{collection}} of all mainstream elements opposed to Aberhart which ran nominally independent candidates in the 1940 and 1944 elections, and denounced Aberhart's government as a [...] "tyrannical dictatorship" [...] and the premier as the most sadistic man he <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met.</b>|$|E
500|$|Latter Days {{was written}} and {{directed}} by C.

Cox based both characters– Christian and Aaron– on himself. He was raised as a Mormon and served a mission before coming out as gay, and had wondered what the two halves of himself would have said to each other if they <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met.</b>|$|E
