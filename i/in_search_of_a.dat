Success depended on finding a strait or passage through the South American land masses, or finding {{the southern tip of}} the continent and sailing around it. The South American coast was sighted on 6 December 1519, and Magellan moved cautiously southward, following the coast to reach latitude 49°S on 31 March 1520. Little if anything was known of the coast south of this point, so Magellan decided to wait out the southern winter here, and established the settlement of Puerto San Julian.|$|E

5|$|Edwards {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the film after seeing fishermen attempt to bring a creature in with a net, and imagining a monster inside.

Edwards cast McNairy and Able in the lead roles. Principal photography lasted three weeks and had a production crew of six people. Filming took place in five countries, and many locations were used without permission. Most of the extras were people who were at these locations during filming and were persuaded to act in it; all of their dialogue was improvised, and Edwards provided outlines of the primary plot points.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth David Ltd {{was never}} more than {{modestly}} profitable, but David would not lower her standards <b>in</b> <b>search</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> commercial return. A new manager {{was brought in to}} run the shop and David fought against many of his changes, but she was always in the minority against her fellow directors.

Gradually her business partners found her commercial approach unsustainable, and in 1973 she left the company. To her annoyance, the shop continued to trade under her name, although she tried periodically to persuade her former colleagues to change it.|$|E
