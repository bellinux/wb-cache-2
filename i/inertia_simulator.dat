40|$|In {{order to}} {{simulate}} ultra-large {{moment of inertia}} required by space station manipulator without mechanism interfere, a load equivalent rotational inertia simulation method based on parallel mechanism configuration and planet-gear increaser is proposed. According {{to the principle of}} equivalent dynamics theory, mathematic model of equivalent moment of inertia of shoulder joint and wrist joint is established. This method proves effective by mechanism and numerical simulation under different operating conditions, and relative simulation errors of <b>inertia</b> <b>simulator</b> meet allowable precision requirements with smaller mass and volume.

40|$|In {{the study}} on the braking system, the <b>inertia</b> <b>simulator</b> is necessary, which is {{generally}} realized by inertia plate. Its advantage is simple and accurate, whereas the disadvantage is the larger volume and difficult to be adjusted. This paper presents a novel scheme, which is realized by hydrostatic secondary control circuit. The inertia can be increased and decreased by electro-hydraulic servo control through momentum feedback, in which a dual variable servo pump is adopted, with the velocity and torque feedback loops applied. In the beginning, it is set as speed control mode until it reaches the braking speed. Meanwhile, it turns to the sate of <b>inertia</b> <b>simulator,</b> which is the torque control mode, so as to keep the inertia as set value. The function of inertia simulation system based on hydrostatic secondary control is to simulate the momentum, which is realized by momentum feedback control, {{and it can be}} calculated through accelerator and desired inertia. The variable pump is driven by constant pressure network, and the variable swashplate is controlled through servo valve. The torque feedback and speed feedback guarantee the control performance requirements. Since there are some problems of nonlinearity, instability, strength friction, etc. a hybrid fuzzy control method are adopted to get higher dynamic control precise and steady characteristics. It is concluded that the scheme and control method is available and validity...|$|E
40|$|Measuring pilot {{force on}} pilot control loaders used in flight {{simulators}} is difficult due to force errors introduced by pilot control loader <b>inertia,</b> <b>simulator</b> cab motion, and gravity. Attempts {{to correct this}} problem by using strain gauges near the grip handle or in gloves have proven impractical because the devices are sensitive to grip position. This paper describes a technique for measuring the pilot control loader pilot force with compensation for all inertial effects by incorporating an accelerometer located at a specific location for each particular pilot control loader axis. There are no additional requirements on the pilot, who is only required to operate the pilot control loader in a normal manner. The pitch axis on a McFadden wheel and column pilot control loader, used at the NASA Ames Research Center, was used to demonstrate the pilot-force measurement technique with compensation for inertial effects and gravity.

40|$|Design of Satellite Attitude Control System (ACS) that {{involves}} plant uncertainties and large angle manoeuvres following a stringent pointing control, may require new non-linear control techniques {{in order to}} have adequate stability, good performance and robustness. In that context, experimental validation of new non-linear control techniques through prototypes is the way to increase confidence in the controller designed. The Space Mechanics and Control Division (DMC) of INPE is constructing a 3 -D simulator to supply the conditions for implementing and testing satellite ACS hardware and software. The 3 -D simulator can accommodate various satellites components; like sensors, actuators, computers and its respective interface and electronic. Depending on the manoeuvre the 3 -D simulator plant can be highly non-linear and if the <b>simulator</b> <b>inertia</b> parameters are not well determined the plant also can present some kind of uncertainty. As a result, controller designed by linear control technique can have its performance and robustness degraded, therefore controllers designed by new non-linear approach must be considered. This paper presents the application of the State-Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE) method in conjunction with Kalman filter technique to design a controller for the DMC 3 -D satellite simulator. The SDRE can be considered as the non-linear counterpart of Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) control technique. Initially, a simple comparison between the LQR and SDRE controller is performed. After that, practical applications are presented to address problems like presence of noise in process and measurements and incomplete state information. Kalman filter is considered as state observer to address these issues. The effects of the plant non-linearities and noises (uncertainties) are considered in the performance and robustness of the controller designed by the SDRE and Kalman filter. The 3 -D simulator simulink-based model has been developed to perform the simulations examples to investigate the SDRE controller performance using the states estimated by the Kalman filter. Simulations have demonstrated the validity of the proposed approach, once the SDRE controller has presented good stability margin, great performance and robustness. Pages: 22 - 2...|$|R
