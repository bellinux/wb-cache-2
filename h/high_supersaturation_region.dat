40|$|We {{study the}} {{spontaneous}} nucleation {{and growth of}} sodium chloride crystals induced by controlled evaporation in confined geometries (microcapillaries) spanning several orders of magnitude in volume. In all experiments, the nucleation happens reproducibly at a very <b>high</b> <b>supersaturation</b> S ∼ 1. 6 and is independent of the size, shape, and surface properties of the microcapillary. We show from classical nucleation theory that this is expected: S ∼ 1. 6 corresponds {{to the point where}} nucleation first becomes observable on experimental time scales.

40|$|Titan, Saturn's largest satellite, has a thick nitrogen/methane atmosphere. In Titan's lower atmosphere, methane is {{saturated}} or supersaturated {{with respect}} to nucleation and may form clouds. To better characterize the properties of Titan's methane clouds we have measured the saturation ratio required to obtain butane nucleation, S (sub crit), on Titan tholin material and organic films. We find a critical saturation ratio for butane on tholin particles of S (sub crit) = 1. 40, suggesting <b>high</b> <b>supersaturations</b> are required for nucleation.

Δμ 0 denotes the same difference at a plane interface (d→∞), Ω denotes the atomic volume of O.

In a word, the larger the diameter of nanowire is, the larger the diameter of Zn droplet is, and the <b>higher</b> <b>supersaturation</b> of the liquid–solid interface is. As the supersaturation increase (diameter: 200 – 500 nm for ZnO), the epitaxial growth will manifest itself by masking the periodic structure; hence the periodic structure will disappear.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to better {{understand}} the use of carbon dioxide (CO 2) supercritical fluid based separation or fabrication techniques to produce high-quality, high-value added materials, particularly from a solubility perspective. Supercritical fluid is environmentally friendly as compared with organic solvents and possesses properties such as liquid-like densities and high diffusivities that are favorable to various processing operations. In such an operation, the raw materials are processed to yield special properties and improved product attributes to benefit the eventual application. However, due to the different roles that a supercritical fluid takes in different processes, a thorough understanding of the physicochemical phenomena to utilize it properly in each process is essential to obtain a successful product. Indeed, the successful development and design of each technique requires detailed phase behavioral information of the components involved and understanding of the process mechanisms. In this research, we highlight the potentials of supercritical fluid technologies for the production of high-value added materials by developing methods involving chromatography, crystallization, extraction and reaction. Four different processes were investigated to address the issues involved in developing the separation and fabrication processes that can lead to the output of targeted quality products. The first project demonstrates the course of developing a separation process by supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) that can simultaneously separate high purity single enantiomers of (-) Tröger’s Base 99. 19 % and (+) Tröger’s Base 98. 82 % from a racemic mixture. Supercritical CO 2 is used as the mobile phase and slight changes in the fluid dynamics would alter separation quality. Solubility parameter calculations and the ternary phase diagram of the system, assist in developing a base case scenario that can be used as a starting point for the separation. An iterative parameter optimization approach then follows to guide decision making to achieve separation performance target. This procedure relies on two causal tables, a constructed compilation of own experiments and those obtained from the literature, that summarizes the qualitative relationship between chromatographic characteristics and separation performance and those between chromatographic characteristics and operating parameters. The second process focuses on obtaining nanoparticles with narrow particle size distributions for the development of a more effective pharmaceutical formulation. The particle formation process by precipitation through compressed anti-solvent (PCA) technique was carried out on salicylic acid as the model drug, ethanol and acetone as the cosolvent, and supercritical CO 2 as the anti-solvent. Solubility determination by experiments, and visualization of phase diagrams facilitated the identification of the regions for operation and to effectively precipitate small and uniform particles. It was discovered that particles in the nano-range could be produced in the <b>higher</b> <b>supersaturation</b> <b>region</b> without changing the nozzle size of the PCA system. Uniformed particles as small as 63. 35 nm were obtained and the dissolution results revealed a substantially better performance of the PCA processed nanoparticles compared to that of the unprocessed. The third is a polymer encapsulation process by supercritical fluid extraction of emulsion (SFEE) for the development of a drug polymer composite particle. The practicality of this process was illustrated with ibuprofen as the drug to be encapsulated by biodegradable polymer, polylactic-glycolic acid while supercritical CO 2 acted as the solvent to remove the oil phase from the emulsion. A standard emulsion was formulated and used throughout the study to investigate how the conditions for the supercritical CO 2 extraction affected the final encapsulated product. The operating conditions of the second step in the SFEE process were shown to have direct relation with the drug release characteristics, namely drug content, encapsulation efficiency and drug release profile. It was found that the drug content of the composite particle was affected by the solubility of the drug compound in CO 2. The rate of release was affected by the surface area and the Tg of that composite polymer particle. Round particles of 100 – 300 nm were generally obtained for this study. In the fourth project, we designed and built an apparatus for the synthesis of metallic nanostructures by the templating method using supercritical CO 2 as the reaction medium in chemical fluid deposition (CFD) process. Ordered platinum nanowire bundles were molded out from mesoporous silica template, SBA- 15, with a pore channel diameter of 7 nm. Solubility study of the platinum precursor, platinum (II) dimethylcyclooctadiene, in supercritical CO 2 was carried out to obtain a phase diagram in order to optimize the operating parameters required for the metal deposition process. High purity and uniform nanowires with high aspect ratios (1 : 200) were obtained at moderate temperature and pressure conditions...|$|R

40|$|Using {{simulations}} {{we identify}} three dynamic regimes in supersaturated isotropic fluid states of short hard rods: (i) for moderate supersaturations we observe nucleation of multi-layered crystalline clusters; (ii) at <b>higher</b> <b>supersaturation,</b> we find nucleation of small crystallites which arrange into long-lived locally favored structures that get kinetically arrested, while (iii) at even <b>higher</b> <b>supersaturation</b> the dynamic arrest {{is due to}} the conventional cage-trapping glass transition. For longer rods we find that the formation of the (stable) smectic phase out of a supersaturated isotropic state is strongly suppressed by an isotropic-nematic spinodal instability that causes huge spinodal-like orientation fluctuations with nematic clusters diverging in size. Our results show that glassy dynamics and spinodal instabilities set kinetic limits to nucleation in a highly supersaturated hard-rod fluids. Comment: Accepted by Physical Review Letter...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} mixing on nucleation of protein crystals. The mixing of protein and precipitant was controlled by changing the flow rate in a plug-based microfluidic system. The nucleation rate inversely depended on the flow rate, and flow rate {{could be used to}} control nucleation. For example, at <b>higher</b> <b>supersaturations,</b> precipitation happened at low flow rates while large crystals grew at high flow rates. Mixing at low flow velocities in a winding channel induces nucleation more effectively than mixing in straight channels. A qualitative scaling argument that relies on a number of assumptions is presented to understand the experimental results. In addition to helping fundamental understanding, this result may be used to control nucleation, using rapid chaotic mixing to eliminate formation of precipitates at <b>high</b> <b>supersaturation</b> and using slow chaotic mixing to induce nucleation at lower supersaturation...|$|R

At the lowest supersaturation, the growth behavior was mainly the advancement of the initial step edges and filling in of the etch pits formed in the water before the BaSO 4 solution was injected. For solutions with <b>higher</b> <b>supersaturation,</b> the growth behavior was characterized by the advance of the and [010] half-layer steps with two different advance rates {{and the formation of}} growth spirals with a rhombic to bow-shaped form and sector-shaped two-dimensional (2 D) nuclei. The advance rates of the initial steps and the two steps of 2 D nuclei were proportional to the SI. In contrast, the advance rates of the parallel steps with extremely short step spacing on growth spirals were proportional to SI 2, indicating that the lateral growth rates of growth spirals were directly proportional to the step separations. This dependence of the advance rate of every step on the growth spirals on the step separations predicts that the growth rates along the [001] direction of the growth spirals were proportional to SI 2 for lower supersaturations and to SI for <b>higher</b> <b>supersaturations.</b> The nucleation and growth rates of the 2 D nuclei increased sharply for <b>higher</b> <b>supersaturations</b> using exponential functions.

At present, crystals are mostly grown using trial-and-error procedures, and protocols that rapidly screen for the crystal nucleation step are rare. Presented here is an approach to minimize the consumption of precious protein material while searching for the nucleation conditions. Acoustically levitated drops of known protein concentration (0. 25 - 1. 5 -L volumes) are injected with crystallizing agents using piezoelectric flow-through dispensers (ejecting 50 - 100 -pL droplets at 1 - 9000 droplets/s). A restricted number of crystallizing agents representing three classes are used: poly(ethylene glycol), salts, and the viscous alcohol 2 -methyl 2, 4 -pentanediol. From a digitized picture of the levitated drop volume, calculations are performed giving the concentrations of all components in the drop {{at any time during}} a "precipitation experiment". Supersaturation is the prerequisite for crystal nucleation, and protein precipitation indicates <b>high</b> <b>supersaturation.</b> A light source illuminates the levitated drop, and protein precipitation is monitored using right-angle light scattering. On the basis of these intensity measurements and the volume determination, precipitation diagrams for each crystallizing agent are constructed that give the protein/crystallizing agent concentration boundaries between the minimum and the maximum detectable protein precipitation. Guided by the concentration values obtained from such plots, when approaching the <b>supersaturation</b> <b>region,</b> separate crystallization drops are mixed and allowed to equilibrate under paraffin oil. At conditions in which microcrystals can be observed, the nucleation tendency of the macromolecule is confirmed. Optimization of crystallization conditions can then follow.

Details are given for the screening procedure of D-serine dehydratase, an enzyme earlier found to be difficult to crystallize reproducibly.

In {{order to reduce}} the impact of this, effective treatment methods are required. The use of crystallization inhibitors to mitigate salt damage has been proposed in the past; however, to date their effectiveness on cultural heritage objects has not been proven. Therefore a detailed experimental study to see the effect of crystallization inhibitors on the drying behavior of salinated porous materials has been undertaken. Two types of drying experiments were performed to observe the crystallization behavior of salt solutions with and without the presence of inhibitors: (1) in droplets of salt solution; (2) in porous supports (brick) contaminated with salt solution. From the droplet drying experiments it is shown that the presence of inhibitor results in <b>higher</b> <b>supersaturation</b> and changes the crystal morphology from cubic to dendritic crystals. In the brick drying experiments, due to the dendritic crystal morphology in the presence of inhibitor, advection becomes the governing phenomenon for ion transport.
