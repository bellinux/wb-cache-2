The identification is constructive with closed-form formulas for the elasticity with respect to each input for each firm. We propose that the flexible <b>input</b> <b>cost</b> ratio {{plays the role of}} a control function under "non-collinear heterogeneity" between elasticities with respect to two flexible inputs. The ex ante flexible <b>input</b> <b>cost</b> share can be used to identify the elasticities with respect to flexible inputs for each firm. The elasticities with respect to labor and capital can be subsequently identified for each firm under the timing assumption admitting the functional independence...|$|R

We build, for the first time, a non-linear threshold panel vector-error-correction model (PVECM) and propose efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Bayesian techniques. Our findings indicate that states with high margin experience a slower adjustment and a more asymmetric response to <b>input</b> price <b>cost</b> shocks. Our results are robust to potential structural breaks in the threshold parameter, which is important as market conditions change over time and are very sensitive to production/consumption constraints. Lastly, we attribute fluctuations in the gasoline prices to <b>input</b> <b>cost</b> shocks, arguing that the peak responses occurring one month after the shock are short-lived...|$|R

Optimization problems run through modern economics, many with explicit economic or technical constraints.

During the 2008 federal election Dion's key policy plank was his Green Shift plan, a revenue neutral carbon tax which {{would put a}} price on greenhouse gas emissions while reducing income taxes. The Green Shift had been heavily criticized by the Conservatives and it was believed to have been a significant factor in the party's poor showing in the election. Following the election Ignatieff announced he would not campaign on Dion's Green Shift. In a speech to the Edmonton Chamber of Commerce in February 2009, he said; [...] "You can't win elections if you're adding to the <b>input</b> <b>costs</b> of a farmer putting diesel into his tractor, or you're adding to the <b>input</b> <b>costs</b> of a fisherman putting diesel into his fishing boat, or a trucker transporting goods".

Next, we establish some mild sufficient condition for the key lemma linking the identification capacity with the resolvability to hold for the continuous input alphabet case with <b>input</b> <b>cost</b> constraint. Under this mild condition, it is shown that we can reach the continuous-input fundamental theorem of the same form as that for the fundamental theorem with finite input alphabet.

Delay in completion of a project not only affects the financing costs and the rental revenue but also it may, on a more strategic note, determine {{the success or failure of}} a project. A time to build option model consisting of a stochastic rate of completion and a stochastic net project payoff is applied to the sequential construction process of a large scale construction project. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that the optimal payoff value, that triggers the exercise of the option to invest at a maximum rate, increases positively with the increases in cash flow volatility, <b>input</b> <b>cost</b> uncertainty, excess asset return per unit risk and maximum rate of investment. However, it has a negative relationship with the rental yield. In a case study involving a commercial project, the premium for hedging the payoff risks by pre-leasing a project was estimated at 11. 29 %, whereas the additional cost incurred for shielding a project against <b>input</b> <b>cost</b> risks in a design and build contract was estimated at 7. 80 %, where each is given as a percentage of the total construction costs.

40|$|We {{show that}} the Lagrange dual {{problems}} of the channel capacity problem with <b>input</b> <b>cost</b> and the rate distortion problem are simple geometric programs. Upper bounds on channel capacity and lower bounds on rate distortion can be efficiently generated from their duals. For channel capacity, the geometric programming dual characterization is shown to be equivalent to the minmax Kullback–Leibler (KL) characterization in [10], [14]. For rate distortion, the geometric programming dual is extended to rate distortion with two-sided state information. A “duality by mapping ” is then given between the Lagrange dual problems of channel capacity with <b>input</b> <b>cost</b> and rate distortion, which resolves several apparent asymmetries between their primal problems in the familiar form of mutual information optimization problems. Both the primal and dual problems can be interpreted in a common framework of free energy optimization from statistical physics...|$|R

With different combinations of repair and maintenance materials, two of the three objectives can be achieved at any one time, when labor <b>inputs,</b> <b>costs,</b> and carbon emissions are set as separate constraints.

40|$|This study {{compared}} farm production, crop yield, <b>input</b> <b>cost,</b> {{and income}} in organic and conventional farming systems {{in three states}} of India: Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu. The results showed that organic farming reduced the <b>input</b> <b>cost</b> without affecting the net margin in all three states.

While yield of rice and wheat generally was lower under the organic systems, yield from intercropping food crops was generally higher. The number of agro-ecological methods and percentage of farms practicing different agro-ecological methods were higher under organic systems than conventional systems. These results suggest that organic farming has the potential to improve food security of small farmers by reducing indebtedness due to the lower cost of production without affecting total farm production and farm income. ...|$|R
