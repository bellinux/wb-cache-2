This includes humans experiencing the awareness of being aware of ourselves, an intrinsic ability to humans. It's the ability to look in a mirror and {{know that you are}} looking at yourself, and not just another human being. Being awake allows the distinction between tasks and default brain states, and also distinguishes between background and <b>foreground</b> <b>processing.</b> Being awake allows the person to not only be aware of themselves and the world, but also to have conscious motor coordination and understand the difference between need and want that comes from secondary consciousness.|$|E
40|$|Even a {{fully loaded}} {{computer}} system, where the bottleneck resource is constantly busy, often has some idle capacities available on other resources. This proposal argues for using these idle capacities speculatively, increasing system performance for correct predictions. In such a system, all resources will ideally be constantly loaded with either regular foreground tasks, or speculative idle-time tasks. The key contribution of this proposal {{is a model}} for non-interfering use of idle resource capacity, based on three principles: resource prioritization between regular foreground and idle-time use, preemptability of idle-time processing, and isolation of speculative side effects. Current operating systems fail to provide all three capabilities. Without new mechanisms, processing of speculative tasks can delay or even starve <b>foreground</b> <b>processing,</b> and result in a decreased foreground performance, instead of increasing it. Under the proposed model, speculative tasks only execute using otherwise idle resource capacities; the model also shields <b>foreground</b> <b>processing</b> from {{the side effects of}} their presence in the system. Thus, speculation can no longer delay or interfere with <b>foreground</b> <b>processing.</b> Based o...|$|E

Accordingly, choosing the smallest signed disparities across the band means choosing the disparities that belong mostly to foreground objects. Since large disparities are typically associated with <b>foreground</b> objects, this <b>processing</b> step is consistent with our goals and is helpful in resolving some of the ambiguities. The s-wide band around each edge pixel is processed according to the following rule (Figure 8): [...]...|$|R
40|$|Values are {{critical}} for intelligent behavior, since values determine interests, and interests determine relevance. Therefore we address relevance {{and its role in}} intelligent behavior in animals and machines. Animals avoid exhaustive enumeration of possibilities by focusing on relevant aspects of the environment, which emerge into the (cognitive) foreground, while suppressing irrelevant aspects, which submerge into the background. Nevertheless, the background is not invisible, and aspects of it can pop into the foreground if background processing deems them potentially relevant. Essential to these ideas are questions of how contexts are switched, which defines cognitive/behavioral episodes, and how new contexts are created, which allows the efficiency of foreground/background processing to be extended to new behaviors and cognitive domains. Next we consider mathematical characterizations of the foreground/background distinction, which we treat as a dynamic separation of the concrete space into (approximately) orthogonal subspaces, which are processed differently. Background processing is characterized by large receptive fields which project into a space of relatively low dimension to accomplish rough categorization of a novel stimulus and its approximate location. Such background processing is partly innate and partly learned, and we discuss possible correlational (Hebbian) learning mechanisms. <b>Foreground</b> <b>processing</b> is characterized by small receptive fields which project into a space of comparatively high dimension to accomplish precise categorization and localization of the stimuli relevant to the context. We also consider mathematical models of valences and affordances, which are an aspect of the foreground. Cells processing foregound information have no fixed meaning (i. e., their meaning is contextual), so it is necessary to explain how the processing accomplished by foreground neurons can be made relative to the context. Thus we consider the properties of several simple mathematical models of how the contextual representation controls <b>foreground</b> <b>processing.</b> We show how simple correlational processes accomplish the contextual separation of foreground from background on the basis of differential reinforcement. That is, these processes account for the contextual separation of the concrete space into disjoint subspaces corresponding to the foreground and background. Since an episode may comprise the activation of several contexts (at varying levels of activity) we consider models, suggested by quantum mechanics, of <b>foreground</b> <b>processing</b> in superposition. That is, the contextual state may be a weighted superposition of several pure contexts, with a corresponding superposition of the foreground representations and the processes operating on them. This leads us to a consideration of the nature and origin of contexts. Although some contexts are innate, many are learned. We discuss a mathematical model of contexts which allows a context to split into several contexts, agglutinate from several contexts, or to constellate out of relatively acontextual processing. Finally, we consider the acontextual processing which occurs when the current context is no longer relevant, and may trigger the switch to another context or the formation of a new context. We relate this to the situation known as "breakdown" in phenomenology...|$|E
40|$|Attentive user {{interfaces}} are {{user interfaces}} that aim {{to support the}} user’s attentional capacities. By sensing the users’ attention for objects and people in their everyday environment, and by treating user attention as a limited resource, these interfaces avoid today’s ubiquitous patterns of interruption. Focusing upon attention as a central interaction channel allows development of more sociable methods of communication and repair with ubiquitous devices. Our methods are analogous to human turn taking in group communication. Turn taking improves the user’s ability to conduct <b>foreground</b> <b>processing</b> of conversations. Attentive user interfaces {{bridge the gap between}} the foreground and periphery of user activity in a similar fashion, allowing users to move smoothly in between. We present a framework for augmenting user attention through attentive user interfaces. We propose five key properties of attentive systems: (i) to sense attention; (ii) to reason about attention; (iii) to regulate interactions; (iv) to communicate attention and (v) to augment attention...|$|E
40|$|Style is an {{important}} aspect of literature, and stylistic deviations are sometimes labeled foregrounded, since their manner of expression deviates from the stylistic default. Russian Formalists have claimed that <b>foregrounding</b> increases <b>processing</b> demands and therefore causes slower reading – an effect called retardation. We tested this claim experimentally by having participants read short literary stories while measuring their eye movements. Our results confirm that readers indeed read slower and make more regressions towards foregrounded passages as compared to passages that are not foregrounded. A closer look, however, reveals significant individual differences in sensitivity to foregrounding. Some readers in fact do not slow down at all when reading foregrounded passages. The slowing down effect for literariness was related to a slowing down effect for high perplexity (unexpected) words: those readers who slowed down more during literary passages also slowed down more during high perplexity words, even though no correlation between literariness and perplexity existed in the stories. We conclude that individual differences {{play a major role in}} processing of literary texts and argue for accounts of literary reading that focus on the interplay between reader and tex...|$|R

40|$|Digital image matting is {{a process}} of extracting a {{foreground}} object from an arbitrary natural image. Unlike the image segmentation task it is required to process fuzzy objects (like hair, feathers, etc.) and produce correct opacity channel for them. The result can then be composited onto a new background or edited by <b>processing</b> <b>foreground</b> and background layers separately. Digital image matting has become a compulsory step in many photo-editing and video-compositing tasks. Currently professional digital artists have to accurately trace objects contours and paint the details to achieve maximum quality. Our aim is to create a convenient workflow for automating this process and make it possible to effectively handle high-resolution images. In this paper we show how a smoothness constraint can be incorporated into Bayesian matting algorithm framework as additional regularization to improve the result quality without affecting the computation speed. We also demonstrate the hierarchical approach that significantly increases processing speed without noticeable loss of quality. This allows us to create convenient digital image matting system...|$|R

Traditionally artificial intelligence has started with simple, primitive features, and attempted to construct from them a representation of the environment. If too few features are used, then the processing is imprecise and crude. However, if sufficient features are used to permit precise processing in all contexts, then the system is defeated by the combinatorial explosion of features. In natural intelligence, in contrast, we begin with a nervous system that can process in real-time the “concrete space ” represented by the interface between the animal’s nervous system and its environment. The separation of foreground from background then serves to increase the efficiency of this process. Instead of trying to construct the concrete world from abstract predicates, the brain projects the very highdimensional concrete world into lower dimensional subspaces; this projection is context-sensitive and rapidly adaptable. Therefore it is not vulnerable to the combinatorial explosion. We consider the connection between these ideas and the concepts of intentionality, as discussed by Brentano and Husserl, and information, as quantified by Shannon and Weaver. In particular, the Shannon-Weaver measure ignores relevance, which is essential to biologica...|$|R
