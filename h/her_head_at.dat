25|$|The use of veil in Renaissance paintings, {{from the}} Meditations on the Life of Christ, symbolizes {{the manner in}} which the Madonna wrapped the Child in the veil from <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> the Nativity and, prophetically, again at the Crucifixion.|$|E
25|$|This {{species of}} wasp is not {{particularly}} aggressive. When a young nest is disturbed the foundress will first place <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> the entrance in an alert position. Then she flies quickly around the nest and may fall suddenly to the ground. This falling to the ground has only been observed in Dolichovespula species and its purpose is unclear. When small insects such as ants or spiders crawl on the nest the wasp responds by grabbing them in her mandibles and dropping to the ground. It is usually not necessary for her {{to try to keep}} these insects out of the nest as they are rarely seen to try and enter. Once there are some workers in a young nest the queen and workers cooperate to defend it.|$|E

500|$|Besides {{developing}} Vulcan {{ears and}} alien masks, Phillips {{and his assistant}} Charles Schram applied more routine makeup to the principal actors. Khambatta's head had to be freshly shaved each day, then given an application of makeup to reduce glare from the hot set lights. Khambatta had no qualms about shaving <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> first, but began worrying if her hair would grow back properly. Roddenberry proposed insuring Khambatta's hair after the actress voiced her concerns, believing the price of such insurance to be negligible. Roddenberry also saw other benefits to taking out a policy: ...|$|E
500|$|In Cambodia, the Ab (...) , {{similar to}} the Penanggalan is either a young or an old woman which detaches <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> night through windows of houses looking for lungs, hearts and blood of dead or alive animals and returns to her body in the day. Married Abs go to bed quickly and starts {{detaching}} their heads. Most {{of them do not}} allow anyone to go into the room and their husbands are afraid of them, some might even run away from the house. In movies, women turn into abs through a special holy water but according to local legends it is passed through heredity. Abs are considered to be afraid of humans but will run after them if they are afraid of her. She might get her intestines stuck into thorns. The Abs like a river go along a certain path and remembers it very carefully.|$|E

2500|$|Forensic study {{indicated}} that Dando had been shot by a bullet from a 9mm calibre semi-automatic pistol, with the gun pressed against <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> {{the moment of the}} shot. Richard Hughes, her next door neighbour, heard a surprised cry from Dando [...] "like someone greeting a friend" [...] but heard no gunshot. Hughes looked out of his front window and, while not realising what had happened, made the only certain sighting of the killer—a six-foot-tall (183 cm) white man aged around 40, walking away from Dando's house.|$|E
2500|$|Blanchett has {{described}} herself as being [...] "part extrovert, part wallflower" [...] during childhood. She had {{a penchant for}} dressing in traditionally masculine clothing, and went through goth and punk phases during her teenage years, and shaved <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> one point. She attended primary school in Melbourne at Ivanhoe East Primary School; for her secondary education, she attended Ivanhoe Girls' Grammar School and then Methodist Ladies' College, where she explored her passion for the performing arts. In her late teens and early twenties, she worked at a nursing home in Victoria. She studied economics and fine arts at the University of Melbourne but dropped out after one year to travel overseas. While in Egypt, Blanchett was asked to play an American cheerleader, as an extra in the Egyptian boxing movie, Kaboria; in need of money, she accepted. Upon her return to Australia, she moved to Sydney and enrolled in the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) to pursue an acting career. She graduated from NIDA in 1992 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the last}} day of her life, Kupcinet had dinner with future Lost in Space cast member Mark Goddard and his wife, Marcia Rogers Goddard, at their house on Coldwater Canyon Drive in Beverly Hills (near Mulholland Drive). She was due there at 6:30 pm, but arrived an hour late by taxicab. The couple said Kupcinet only toyed with her food during the meal. Marcia Goddard told two {{officers}} from the L.A. County Sheriff's Office that during dinner with Kupcinet [...] "... her lips seemed numb. Her voice was funny. She moved <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> odd angles." [...] The Goddards also noticed that her pupils were constricted. Mark Goddard told authorities that he confronted Kupcinet about her altered state during the meal, and she began to cry, putting her arm around him. At one point during the meal, Kupcinet told her friends an unsubstantiated story about a baby that had been abandoned on her doorstep earlier that day. At 8:30 pm, a taxicab arrived to take her home, and she promised to telephone the Goddards soon.|$|E

2500|$|Critical {{reception}} of the song, {{as well as the}} album, was positive. Rolling Stone described the song as [...] "fairly peppy for a PJ Harvey song about murder" [...] and rated it three stars out of five. In Pitchfork Media's review of Let England Shake, Scott Plagenhoef stated that [...] "Harvey blackly and comically shakes <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> those post-WWI diplomatic hopes" [...] and described it as [...] "a hilariously depressing coda; her song's character has experienced the unimaginable and is looking to an international peacekeeping body for help." [...] Plagenhoef also cited it as the album's key song, alongside [...] "Written on the Forehead." [...] The Guardian described the song as [...] "a masterstroke" [...] and stated [...] "Harvey clearly understands that the horror doesn't really need embellishing: her way sounds infinitely more shocking and affecting than all the machine-gun sound effects in the world." [...] Patti Smith, to whom Harvey has been compared in the past by critics, hailed the single. Speaking to The Guardian in January 2011, Smith said: [...] "It just makes me happy to exist. Whenever anyone does something of worth, including myself, it just makes me happy to be alive. So I listened to that song all morning, totally happy." ...|$|E
