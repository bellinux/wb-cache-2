Movements in Japan's current account balance have generally mirrored those of the merchandise trade balance considered earlier, although deficits in services and {{net transfers}} have offset the surpluses somewhat. Japan began to register surpluses in the current account in 1965, which later continued to rise, although they were punctuated by short-term deficits following the two oil price hikes in 1973 and 1979 (cf. 1973 oil crisis and 1979 energy crisis).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between the relocation of international production and <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> from the United States using a number of different panel data estimators for six different categories of services.

Our results reveal considerable heterogeneity in {{the relationship between}} trade and production relocation across different categories of services and across the sector in which production relocation takes place. We find a significant positive relationship between exports and international production relocation in the majority of non-service sectors, but a significant negative relationship with relocation in service sectors. Intra-firm exports of affiliate services is the only category of trade raised by additional outward investment in all sectors.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the marginal effects of traditional determinants of {{exports and imports}} {{with a focus on}} the role of price competitiveness in restoring external balances. It is a first attempt to compare marginal effects of various harmonised competitiveness indicators (HCIs) on both exports and imports of both goods and services across individual euro area countries. We find evidence that HCIs based on broader cost and price measures have a larger marginal effect (with some exceptions) on exports of goods. <b>Exports</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> are sensitive to HCIs in big euro area countries and Slovakia, where <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> are also found more sensitive to competitiveness indicators based on broader price measures. Imports of goods and imports of services are quite insensitive to changes in relative prices. Finally, in some cases measures of fit indicate that a large unexplained residual part is present, implying that other non-price related factors might {{play an important role in}} driving foreign trade...|$|E
40|$|Explanations of the {{persistent}} deficit in U. S. net {{exports of goods}} rest on macroeconomic developments and an asymmetry in elasticities: the income elasticity for imports being larger than the income elasticity for exports. Such macroeconomic developments are not applicable to the equally persistent surplus in U. S. net <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> unless the income elasticities for services exhibit the reversed asymmetry. There have been surprisingly few attempts to demonstrate {{the existence of this}} reversed asymmetry, a task that I undertake here. Specifically, I estimate income and price elasticities for U. S. trade in services and evaluate the importance of simultaneity and aggregation biases. The analysis reveals two findings. First, the income elasticity for U.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the determinants of}} <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> <b>services,</b> distinguishing between modern and traditional services. We consider both the growth of export volumes and so-called export surges – periods of rapid sustained export growth. We ask whether the determinants of export growth rates and surges differ between merchandise, traditional services and modern services and whether developing countries are different. Our findings confirm {{the importance of the}} real exchange rate for export growth. We find that the effect of the real exchange rate is even stronger for <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> than exports of goods; it is especially strong for exports of modern services. While the evidence of differential effects between advanced and developing countries is weaker, our results nonetheless suggest that as developing countries shift from exporting primarily commodities and merchandise to exporting traditional and modern services {{in the course of their}} development, appropriate policies toward the real exchange rate become even more important. ...|$|E
