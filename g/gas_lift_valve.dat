These forms of lift were used as far back as 1797 in mines to lift water from mine shafts.

Gas lift was used as early as 1864 in Pennsylvania to lift oil wells, also using {{compressed air}}, via an air pipe bringing the air to the bottom of the well. Air was used in Texas for large-scale artificial lift. In 1920 natural gas replaced air, lowering the risk of explosion. From 1929 until 1945 about 25000 patents were issued on different types of <b>gas</b> <b>lift</b> <b>valves</b> that could be used for unloading in stages.

40|$|Gas lift {{optimization}} {{is becoming}} more important now a day in petroleum industry. A proper lift optimization can reduce the operating cost, increase the net present value (NPV) and maximize the recovery from the asset. A widely accepted definition of gas lift optimization is to obtain the maximum output under specified operating conditions. In addition, gas lift, a costly and indispensable means to recover oil from high depth reservoir entails solving the gas lift optimization problems. Gas lift optimization is a continuous process; there are two levels of production optimization. The total field optimization involves optimizing the surface facilities and the injection rate {{that can be achieved}} by standard tools softwares. Well level optimization can be achieved by optimizing the well parameters such as point of injection, injection rate, and injection pressure. All these aspects have been investigated and presented in this study by using experimental data and PROSPER simulation program. The results show that the well head pressure has a large influence on the gas lift performance and also proved that smart <b>gas</b> <b>lift</b> <b>valve</b> can be used to improve gas lift performance by controlling gas injection from down hole. Obtaining the optimum gas injection rate is important because excessive gas injection reduces production rate and consequently increases the operation cost.

40|$|Abstract. Gas lift is an {{artificial}} lift method which {{is commonly used}} in offshore operation with sufficient gas sources as it consumes minimum space on the platform. Gas lift operates by injecting a high pressure gas down through the tubing casing annulus of a well and the injected gas enters the tubing through a <b>gas</b> <b>lift</b> <b>valve</b> installed on the tubing. Gas lift increases production by two means, density reduction of oil column inside the tubing so that the flowing bottom-hole pressure which {{is affected by the}} hydrostatic pressure of the fluid column is reduced and by providing external energy to the oil as the gas expends. Reducing the bottom-hole pressure will improve the drawdown of the well. A production well is modelled by using a production modelling program, Integrated Production Modeling (IPM) Prosper to analyze the production performance at various conditions. A base case model is developed from the production data of an actual oil field to simulate the performance of the actual well without gas lift system. Later, the gas lift is added to the model and the performance was compared with the base case model. The gas parameter was also studied to determine the optimum injection gas condition for maximum oil production. The gas injected at 1490 m can be achieved by injecting the gas with 1200 psi, l 300 psi or 1400 psi. However, the optimum gas injection pressure was determined to be at 1400 psi as the design shows that the required unloading stage is the least. The optimum gas injection rate was determined at 5 MMscf/d with the estimated net revenue is the highest. For injection gas gravity, the lighter gas was determined to be the optimum selection since it gives significant reduction of FBHP (Flowing Bottom Hole Pressure) with less hydrostatic pressure inside the tubing column...|$|E

The use of pressure pulse technology for production testing, giving production rate of gas-liquid mixtures, has been demonstrated on several offshore platforms, and is available on commercial basis. The use of pressure pulse technology for flow condition analysis in production and injection wells is under development. Flow condition analysis can be used to detect and monitor changes in flow channel geometry (for example, formation of deposits) and to locate and quantify fluid entry/exit points downhole. Pressure pulse technology can be used on either the tubing-side or the casing-side of <b>gas</b> <b>lift</b> wells. A quick-acting valve is activated for 20 - 40 seconds and the pressure change measured at the wellhead, immediately up-stream for a tubing-side test and immediately down-stream for casing-side test.

30|$|For {{multiple}} industries, it is {{a common}} practice to flow liquid and gas mixtures through restriction-style chokes (Ajienka et al. 1994; Alimonti et al. 2010; Almeida 2013; Campos et al. 2014; Elgibaly and Nashawi 1998; Grose 1985; Kojasoy et al. 1997; Perkins 1993; Schüller et al. 2003; Zhang and Cai 1999). Specifically, within the oil and gas industry, restriction-style FCDs are heavily used as wellhead chokes to control production from wells, as a critical part of single or multiphase flow measurement <b>valves,</b> and within <b>gas</b> <b>lift</b> <b>valves</b> (Ajienka et al. 1994; Al-Attar 2013; Almeida 2013; Surbey et al. 2013). In SAGD operations, restriction-style FCDs have been used in injection wells as a “steam splitter,” a tool to both mechanically divert steam down the wellbore, add additional points of steam injection, and control the rate of injection into particular reservoir zones to equalize steam delivery along the lateral length (Ghesmat and Zhao 2015; Medina 2015).|$|R
40|$|Gas-lifted {{oil wells}} are {{susceptible}} to failure through mal-function of <b>gas</b> <b>lift</b> <b>valves</b> (GLV). One failure mode occurs when the GLV check valve fails and product passes into the well an-nulus, potentially reaching the wellhead. This is a growing con-cern as offshore wells are drilled thousands of meters below the ocean floor in extreme temperature and pressure conditions and repair and monitoring become difficult. The authors have pre-viously developed a thermally-actuated safety valve to prevent product backflow into the annulus {{in the event of}} check valve failure. The safety valve uses shape memory alloy (SMA) wires to translate a temperature change into a displacement and, based on commercially available SMA wire material properties, re-quires a 6 ◦C temperature change to fully actuate. In some wells, however, check valve failure may result in less than 6 ◦C tem-perature change. In this paper a new concept is developed to sharpen the austenitic phase change in SMA actuators. The concept has broad practical implications because it will allow thermally-activated devices, such as fluid control valves, to be-come much more precise, i. e., translating a small temperature change into a large displacement. The new concept uses the fact that SMA transition temperatures are stress dependent. By specifically controlling stress in the wire, the temperature differ-ence required for austenitic transition can be decreased. This is achieved with a negative-differential spring- a spring that ex-erts a decreasing amount of force as it is displaced. The concept is tested experimentally by conductively and electrically heating SMA wires connected to a negative-differential spring. Results show a 2. 9 ◦C- 5 ◦C reductions, respectively, in the temperature difference required for austenitic transition...|$|R

40|$|Downhole {{monitoring}} {{is valuable}} {{to the oil}} and gas industry due to the advantages knowledge brings when it comes to well optimisation. The more information available about an individual well strengthens the understanding of the total field dynamics, making it possible to maximise a field's productivity. An evaluation of applying one of two types of temperature monitoring systems, Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) and Wellwatcher Flux to the Valhall field has beenconducted. The two systems have been evaluated on the basis of the following criteria:Instillation complexity, operational reliability after instillation, cost of instillation including rig time, contingency plan, experience and the different features the system provides. DTS consists of either a prefabricated ber optic cable or a hollow steel cable that is clamped to the outside of the liner, where an optical ber is pumped in place after the completion string is installed. Due to the well design on Valhall, only the pumpable system is applicable for implementing to the Valhall eld. The fiber itself serves as the temperature sensors, enabling a continuous thermal prole of the well to be measured. The upper and lower completions are mated by a control line wet mate (CLWM), which allows for the fiber to be pumped from the upper to the lower completions. With the pumpable DTS system, it is currently not possible to incorporate pressure sensors. BP has relatively good experience with DTS in Azerbaijan, where improvements have been made to the system. It has continuous sensors, is more cost effective and is also able to monitor the effect of <b>gas</b> <b>lift</b> <b>valves.</b> However, the system has a slightly higher risk of failure during installation due to the CLWM. Once installed however, DTS has abetter contingency plan in the case of failure. Well watcher Flux is an electric cable that has up to 50 temperature point sensors attached. Pressure sensors are most likely available in 2014 and can be spliced directlyon to the cable. The upper and lower completions are connected through an inductive coupler, which allows communication between the two completions. Wellwatcher Flux is relatively new on the market. The system has only had 6 trialruns in India. The Wellwatcher Flux system has a maximum amount of sensors, is more expensive than DTS, and appears to be slightly less complicated to install due to the simplicity and reliability of the inductive coupler connecting the upper and lower completions. Based on the evaluation of the set criteria for the two systems, Wellwatcher Flux is determined to be a better candidate for implementing permanent temperature monitoring on Valhall. </p...|$|R

Today's industry standard, a pressure-actuated valve, is susceptible to various modes of failure, including corrosion and jamming. Safety mechanisms are needed to seal the valve in case of a backflow event, in which oil flows backward through the production tubing. Since human monitoring is difficult to implement at deep level underground, these safety mechanisms have to be highly sensitive and autonomous. This thesis documents the design of an electronically-actuated <b>gas</b> <b>lift</b> safety system that builds on a prior invention based on shape-memory alloy, but, among other features, can handle the slowly changing temperature conditions downhole.

System functionality is proved through model-scale prototype testing within a controlled environment.
