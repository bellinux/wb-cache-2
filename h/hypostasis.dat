25|$|The First Council of Ephesus {{recognised}} {{this doctrine}} and affirmed its importance, {{stating that the}} humanity and divinity of Christ are made one according to nature and <b>hypostasis</b> in the Logos.|$|E
25|$|They {{perceive}} the West as teaching {{through more than}} one type of theological Filioque a different origin and cause of the Holy Spirit; that through the dogmatic Roman Catholic Filioque the Holy Spirit is subordinate to the Father and the Son and not a free, independent and equal to the Father <b>hypostasis</b> that receives his uncreatedness from the origin of all things, the Father <b>hypostasis.</b> Trinity expresses the idea of message, messenger and revealer, or mind, word and meaning. Eastern Orthodox Christians believe in one God the Father, whose person is uncaused and unoriginate, who, because He is love and communion, always exists with His Word and Spirit.|$|E
25|$|Ahn Sahng-hong {{should be}} {{regarded}} as Jesus Christ who had already come, should be titled Christ Ahn Sahng-hong, and pursuant to a traditional trinitarian view of Christian <b>hypostasis</b> Ahn was consequently also The Holy Spirit, God the Father, and thus God.|$|E
25|$|Christians {{in general}} believe that Jesus' miracles were actual {{historical}} events {{and that his}} miraculous works were {{an important part of}} his life, attesting to his divinity and the Hypostatic union, i.e., the dual natures of Christ's humanity and divinity in one <b>hypostasis.</b> Christians believe that while Jesus' experiences of hunger, weariness, and death were evidences of his humanity, the miracles were evidences of his deity.|$|E
25|$|Ceremonial anniversary {{celebrations}} {{are held}} at the Atash Behram {{on the day of}} its founding. The ceremonies in Udvada are held on the ninth day of the ninth month in the Shahenshahi (imperial) version of the Zoroastrian calendar (which, in 2006, was on 25 April). Pilgrims {{from all over the world}} visit the temple on that day. Special ceremonies are also held on the 20th day of each month. In the Zoroastrian calendar, that day is dedicated to the divinity Verethragna (Avestan, Middle Persian Waharam, hence Behram), <b>hypostasis</b> of victory.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} ecumenical councils were convened in the 4th and 5th centuries {{to deal with}} these issues. The Council of Ehesus debated <b>hypostasis</b> (co-existing natures) versus Monophysitism (only one nature) versus Miaphysitism (two natures united as one) versus Nestorianism (disunion of two natures). The 451 Council of Chalcedon was highly {{influential}} and marked a key turning point in the Christological debates that broke apart the church of the Eastern Roman Empire in the 5th century. In Chalcedon the hypostatic union was decreed, namely that Jesus is both fully divine and fully human, making this part of the creed of Orthodox Christianity.|$|E
25|$|In Eastern Orthodox Christianity {{theology}} {{starts with}} the Father <b>hypostasis,</b> not the essence of God, since the Father is the God of the Old Testament. The Father is the origin of all things {{and this is the}} basis and starting point of the Orthodox trinitarian teaching of one God in Father, one God, of the essence of the Father (as the uncreated comes from the Father as this is what the Father is). In Eastern Orthodox theology, God's uncreatedness or being or essence in Greek is called ousia. Jesus Christ is the Son (God Man) of the uncreated Father (God). The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of the uncreated Father (God).|$|E
25|$|In Gnosticism, Eve {{is often}} seen as the {{embodiment}} of the supreme feminine principle, called Barbelo (from Arb-Eloh), barbeloth, or barthenos. She is equated with the light-maiden of Sophia, creator of the word (Logos) of God, the thygater tou photos or simply the Virgin Maiden, Parthenos. In other texts she is equated with Zoe (Life). In other Gnostic texts, such as The <b>Hypostasis</b> of the Archons (The Reality of the Rulers), the Pistis Sophia is equated with Eve's daughter, Norea, the wife of Seth. Especially among the Marcionites, women in Gnosticism were considered equal to men, being revered as prophets, teachers, traveling evangelists, faith healers, priests and even bishops.|$|E
25|$|The Father is the eternal, {{infinite}} and uncreated reality, {{that the}} Christ and the Holy Spirit are also eternal, infinite and uncreated, in that their origin {{is not in}} the ousia of God, but that their origin is in the <b>hypostasis</b> of God called the Father. The double procession of the Holy Spirit bears some resemblance to the teachings of Macedonius I of Constantinople and his sect called the Pneumatomachians in that the Holy Spirit is created by the Son and a servant of the Father and the Son. It was Macedonius' position that caused the specific wording of the section on the Holy Spirit by St Gregory of Nyssa in the finalized Nicene creed.|$|E
25|$|Eastern Orthodox theologians (e.g. Pomazansky) {{say that}} the Nicene Creed as a Symbol of Faith, as dogma, is to address and define church {{theology}} specifically the Orthodox Trinitarian understanding of God. In the hypostases of God as correctly expressed against the teachings considered outside the church. The Father <b>hypostasis</b> of the Nicene Creed is the origin of all. Eastern Orthodox theologians have stated that New Testament passages (often quoted by the Latins) speak of the economy rather than the ontology of the Holy Spirit, and {{that in order to}} resolve this conflict Western theologians made further doctrinal changes, including declaring all persons of the Trinity to originate in the essence of God (the heresy of Sabellianism). Eastern Orthodox theologians see this as teaching of philosophical speculation rather than from actual experience of God via theoria.|$|E
25|$|Several doctrinal {{disputes}} {{from the}} 4th century onwards {{led to the}} calling of ecumenical councils which from a traditional perspective, are the culmination and also a continuation of previous church synods. These Pre Ecumenical councils include the Council of Jerusalem c. 50, Council of Rome 155 AD, Second Council of Rome 193 AD, Council of Ephesus 193 AD, Council of Carthage (251), Council of Iconium 258 AD, Council of Antioch, 264 AD, Councils of Arabia- 246-247 AD, Council of Elvira 306 AD, Council of Carthage (311), Synod of Neo-Caesarea c.314 AD Council of Ancyra 314 AD, Council of Arles 314 AD. The first ecumenical council in part was a continuation of Trinitarian doctrinal issues addressed in pre-legalization of Christianity councils or synods (for examples see Synods of Antioch between 264-269AD and Synod of Elvira). These ecumenical councils with their doctrinal formulations are pivotal {{in the history of}} Christianity in general and to the history of the Orthodox Church in particular. Specifically, these assemblies were responsible for the formulation of Christian doctrine. As such, they constitute a permanent standard for an Orthodox understanding of the Trinity, the person or <b>hypostasis</b> of Christ, the incarnation.|$|E
500|$|The {{setting of}} Arkham Asylum plays {{a large role}} in how the inmates {{perceive}} their own insanity. As said by the Mad Hatter, [...] "ometimes I think the asylum is the head. We're inside a huge head that dreams us all into being." [...] He also described the asylum as being a [...] "looking glass" [...] that shows the subject their own twisted psyche. Morrison used <b>hypostasis</b> to push the story forward, saying that the psychoanalytic theory and Jungian archetypes was an influence.|$|E
500|$|Henry Adams Bellows {{proposes a}} {{relationship}} between Eir and the place name Lyfjaberg, which he translates as [...] "hill of healing". Bellows notes that manuscripts vary about the spelling of the place name, and that he, like others, has followed 19th-century scholar Sophus Bugge's choice. Bellows states that the stanza mentioning Lyfjaberg [...] "implies that Mengloth is a goddess of healing, and hence, perhaps an <b>hypostasis</b> of Frigg, as already intimated by her name [...] In stanza 54, Eir appears as one of Mengloth's handmaidens, and Eir, according to Snorri (Gylfaginning, 35) is herself the Norse Hygeia. Compare this stanza to stanza 32." ...|$|E
2500|$|Apollinaris of Laodicea was {{the first}} to use the term <b>hypostasis</b> in trying to {{understand}} the Incarnation. [...] Apollinaris described the union of the divine and human in Christ as being of a single nature and having a single essence– a single <b>hypostasis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|God has existences (hypostases) of being; {{this concept}} is {{translated}} {{as the word}} [...] "person" [...] in the West. Each <b>hypostasis</b> of God is a specific and unique existence of God. Each has the same essence (coming from the origin, without origin, Father (God) they are uncreated). Each specific quality that constitutes an <b>hypostasis</b> of God, is non-reductionist and not shared. The issue of ontology or being of the Holy Spirit is also complicated by the Filioque in that the Christology and uniqueness of the <b>hypostasis</b> of Jesus Christ would factor into the manifestation of the Holy Spirit. In that Jesus is both God and Man, which fundamentally changes the <b>hypostasis</b> or being of the Holy Spirit, as Christ would be giving to the Holy Spirit an origin or being that was both God the Father (Uncreated) and Man (createdness).|$|E
2500|$|... <b>hypostasis</b> – {{literally}} [...] "that {{which stands}} beneath" [...] the inner reality, emanation (appearance) of God, known to psychics ...|$|E
2500|$|Angra Mainyu (also: Aŋra Mainiiu) is the Avestan-language name of Zoroastrianism's <b>hypostasis</b> of the [...] "destructive spirit". The Middle Persian {{equivalent}} is Ahriman (Anglicised pronunciation: [...] ). Angra Mainyu is omnimalevolent. Angra Mainyu is Ahura Mazda's evil twin.|$|E
2500|$|As (the <b>hypostasis</b> of) {{regularity}} and [...] "right working", aša/arta- {{is present}} when Ahura Mazda fixed {{the course of}} the sun, the moon and the stars (Yasna 44.3), and it is through aša that plants grow (Yasna 48.6).|$|E
2500|$|Drvaspa (druuāspā, drvāspā, drwāspā) is the Avestan {{language}} {{name of an}} [...] "enigmatic" [...] and [...] "strangely discreet" [...] Zoroastrian divinity, {{whose name}} literally means [...] "with solid horses" [...] and which she is then nominally the <b>hypostasis</b> of.|$|E
2500|$|Sraosha is also {{frequently}} {{referred to as}} the [...] "Voice of Conscience", which overlaps with both [...] "Obedience" [...] and as his role as the [...] "Teacher of Daena", Daena being the <b>hypostasis</b> of both [...] "Conscience" [...] and [...] "Religion".|$|E
2500|$|In Yasht 19.46, Akem Manah, {{the demon}} of [...] "evil purpose" [...] {{attempts}} (but fails) to seize khvarenah. The Iranian khvarenah and Dahman, [...] the <b>hypostasis</b> of prayer, render Bushyasta - the demoness of [...] "sloth" [...] – powerless (Yasht l0.97, 13.4).|$|E
2500|$|Ashi (aši) is the Avestan {{language}} {{word for}} the Zoroastrian concept of [...] "that which is attained." [...] As the <b>hypostasis</b> of [...] "reward," [...] "recompense," [...] or [...] "capricious luck," [...] Ashi is also a divinity in the Zoroastrian hierarchy of yazatas.|$|E
2500|$|Verethragna (...) is an Avestan {{language}} neuter noun literally meaning [...] "smiting of resistance" [...] Representing {{this concept}} is the divinity Verethragna, {{who is the}} <b>hypostasis</b> of [...] "victory", and [...] "as a giver of victory Verethragna plainly enjoyed the greatest popularity of old" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Chalcedonian Creed {{agreed with}} Theodore {{that there were}} two natures in the Incarnation. [...] However, the Council of Chalcedon also insisted that <b>hypostasis</b> be used {{as it was in the}} Trinitarian definition: to {{indicate}} the person and not the nature as with Apollinarius.|$|E
2500|$|Based on {{the works}} of {{prominent}} members of theological schools of Antioch and Nisibis, and shaped by liturgical and linguistic traditions of the East-Syriac rite, christology of the Church of the East was very early faced with particular terminological challenges. Exceptional complexity of Greek theological terminology led to frequent debates and controversies {{over the use of}} various terms, both in the Latin West and in Syriac East. Among such terms were: ousia ( [...] , [...] "essence"), physis ( [...] , [...] "nature"), <b>hypostasis</b> ( [...] , [...] "substance"), and prosopon ( [...] , [...] "person"). In Syriac language, term physis was translated as kyānâ (ܟܝܢܐ) and <b>hypostasis</b> was translated as qnômâ (ܩܢܘܡܐ). In the Church of the East, the term qnoma (or qnuma) was used to emphasize the dyophysite position in its radical form, by designating a particular <b>hypostasis</b> to each of the two natures of Christ. Official adoption of such theological positions, that were in odds with the Chalcedonian definition, was gradual (starting from the Synod of Beth Lapat in 484). After several oscillations during the 6th century, the process was completed {{by the beginning of the}} 7th century, and thus a final christological distinction was created between the Church of the East and the [...] "western" [...] Chalcedonian Churches.|$|E
2500|$|Arshtat (...) is the Avestan {{language}} {{name of a}} Zoroastrian {{principle and}} signifies either [...] "justice" [...] or [...] "honesty." [...] As a substantive, arshtat designates the divinity Arshtat, the <b>hypostasis</b> of [...] "Rectitude" [...] and [...] "Justice". Her standing epithet is [...] "world-furthering" [...] or [...] "world-promoting." ...|$|E
2500|$|In scripture {{as well as}} {{in later}} tradition, Bushyasta (Middle Persian Bushasp) is the <b>hypostasis</b> of laziness and idleness. She is the cause of {{procrastination}} as she strives to keep the righteous (ashavan) from performing productive tasks. She lulls the world back to sleep and [...] "makes the faithful forget in slumber the hour of prayer." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{hierarchy}} of yazatas, the Moon is the assistant (or 'cooperator', hamkar) of Vohu Manah (MP: Bahman), the Amesha Spenta of animal welfare, in particular of cattle. The identification with Vohu Manah - the <b>hypostasis</b> of [...] "Good Purpose" [...] or [...] "Good Mind" [...] - is reflected in other texts where the moon is associated with mental harmony and inner peace.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{theme of}} the Rig Veda, [...] "the truth and the gods", is not evident in the Gathas. Thematic {{parallels}} between aša/arta and ŗtá-, however, exist such aa in Yasht 10, the Avestan hymn to Mithra. There, Mithra, who is the <b>hypostasis</b> and the preserver of covenant, is the protector of aša/arta. RigVedic Mitra is likewise preserver of ŗtá-.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{hierarchy}} of Zoroastrian demons (daevas) that mirrors a similar hierarchy of divinities, Aeshma is opposed to Asha Vahishta, the Amesha Spenta that is the <b>hypostasis</b> of [...] "Truth." [...] This opposition also reflects Aeshma's position as messenger of Angra Mainyu (Yasht 19.46), for in {{the hierarchy}} of divinities, Asha is the messenger of Spenta Mainyu, the instrument through which Ahura Mazda's realized ("created by His thought") creation.|$|E
2500|$|Hypostatic union (from the Greek for substance) is a {{technical}} term in Christian theology employed in mainstream Christology {{to describe the}} union of two natures, humanity and divinity, in Jesus Christ. [...] A brief definition {{of the doctrine of}} two natures can be given as: [...] "Jesus Christ, who is identical with the Son, is one person and one <b>hypostasis</b> in two natures: a human and a divine." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dahman Afrin in {{its true}} sense {{literally}} translates to 'devout blessing(s)', and the divinity Dahman is the active principle and <b>hypostasis</b> of the Gathic Avestan Dahma Afriti invocation (Yasna 60.2-7). Yasna 61 also {{refers to the}} prayer as Dahma Vangui Afriti and considers {{it to be the}} fourth most potent incantation. The prayer is invoked as a blessing upon the house of the ashavan, which may be translated as 'just' or 'true' man.|$|E
2500|$|These oppositions {{differ from}} those found in scripture, where the moral {{principles}} (that each Amesha Spenta represents) are opposed by immoral principles. This is not however a complete breach, for while in the Gathas asha–the principle–is the diametric opposite of the abstract druj, in Zoroastrian tradition, it is Ardawahisht, the Amesha Spenta that is the <b>hypostasis</b> of asha, that is opposed to by Indar, who freezes the minds of creatures from practicing [...] "righteousness" [...] (asha).|$|E
2500|$|Zam (Zām) is the Avestan {{language}} {{term for}} the Zoroastrian concept of [...] "earth", in both the sense of land and soil and {{in the sense of}} the world. The earth is prototyped as a primordial element in Zoroastrian tradition, and represented by a minor divinity Zam who is the <b>hypostasis</b> of the [...] "earth". The word itself is cognate to the Baltic 'Zemes' and Slavic 'Zem', both meaning the planet earth as well as soil.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the priesthood}} sought to explain it, if the Malevolent Spirit (lit: Angra Mainyu) and the Benevolent Spirit (Spenta Mainyu, {{identified}} with Ahura Mazda) were twins, then {{they must have}} had a parent, who must have existed before them. The priesthood settled on Zurvan [...] the <b>hypostasis</b> of (Infinite) Time [...] as being “the only possible ‘Absolute’ from whom the twins could proceed” and which was the source of good in the one and the source of evil in the other (Zaehner, 1961).|$|E
2500|$|Airyaman {{is closely}} {{associated}} with Asha Vahishta, the Amesha Spenta of [...] "Best Truth" [...] (or [...] "Best Righteousness"). In Vendidad 20.11 and in Yasht 2 (dedicated to the seven Amesha Spentas), he is described as [...] "following" [...] asha, which is what Asha Vahishta is the <b>hypostasis</b> of. The third Yasht, which is nominally a hymn to Asha Vahishta is for the greater part a praise of the airyaman ishyo, which in Zoroastrian tradition {{is considered to be}} an invocation of the divinity Airyaman.|$|E
