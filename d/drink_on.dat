Alexandria, the second-largest city, imported wine from Laodicea in Syria and the Aegean.

25|$|In 1905, it was {{reported}} that Jean Lanfray, a Swiss farmer, murdered his family and attempted to take his own life after drinking absinthe. The fact that Lanfray was an alcoholic who had consumed considerable quantities of wine and brandy prior to drinking two glasses of absinthe was overlooked or ignored, therefore placing the blame for the murders solely on absinthe. The Lanfray murders were the tipping point in this hotly debated topic, and a subsequent petition to ban absinthe in Switzerland collected more than 82,000 signatures. A referendum was subsequently held on banning the <b>drink</b> <b>on</b> 5 July 1908. After it was approved by voters, the prohibition of absinthe was then written into the Swiss constitution.|$|E
500|$|... "Paranoid Android", {{split into}} four sections, {{is among the}} band's longest {{recorded}} studio tracks at 6:23. The unconventional structure {{was inspired by the}} Beatles' [...] "Happiness Is a Warm Gun" [...] and Queen's [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody", which also eschew a traditional verse-chorus-verse structure. Its musical style was also inspired by the music of the Pixies. The song was written by Yorke after an unpleasant night at a Los Angeles bar, where he saw a woman react violently after someone spilled a <b>drink</b> <b>on</b> her. Its title and lyrics are a reference to Marvin the Paranoid Android from Douglas Adams's The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series.|$|E

Another story recounts that, following a black mass, a footman spilled a <b>drink</b> <b>on</b> [...] "Burn-Chapel" [...] Whaley's coat.

[...] "It didn't taste like Gatorade," [...] Cade said in a 1988 interview with Florida Trend magazine. In fact, according to Cade, when Gators lineman Larry Gagner first tried it, he spat it out and strongly suggested that the original experimental formula tasted more like bodily waste. Dana Shires remembered that [...] "it sort of tasted like toilet bowl cleaner." [...] To make it more palatable, at the suggestion of Cade's wife, the researchers added lemon juice and cyclamate to the original formula of water, salt, sodium citrate, fructose and monopotassium phosphate.|$|E
500|$|... "Paranoid Android" [...] is {{categorised}} {{by three}} distinct moods written in what Yorke {{referred to as}} three different states of mind. The song's lyrics tie in {{with a number of}} themes common in OK Computer, including insanity, violence, slogans, and political objection to capitalism. Yorke's lyrics were based on an unpleasant experience at a Los Angeles bar during which he was surrounded by strangers high on cocaine. In particular, Yorke was frightened by a woman who became violent after someone spilled a <b>drink</b> <b>on</b> her. Yorke characterised the woman as [...] "inhuman", and said [...] "There was a look in this woman's eyes that I'd never seen before anywhere.... Couldn't sleep that night because of it."

500|$|Wenger's {{arrival at}} Arsenal {{was greeted with}} perplexity {{by some of the}} club's players, {{supporters}} and the local media. Although he was touted as a future technical director of The Football Association (FA), he was relatively unknown in English football. Glenn Moore's report in The Independent, dated 24 September 1996, highlighted the mood: [...] "It {{is a measure of the}} insularity of the English game that when ArsÃ¨ne Wenger's name emerged as Arsenal's favoured candidate for their vacant manager's job many supporters were asking: 'ArsÃ¨ne who?'" [...] Unlike his predecessors, Wenger was given control over transfers, contracts and training sessions, and the Arsenal board chose not to meddle in team affairs. One of his first acts as manager was to assure the experienced players they had a future at the club, but he noted the squad was [...] "a bit tight," [...] and needed competition for places. Wenger adopted a hands-on approach to training sessions which energised the squad and made steps to change the drinking culture that afflicted Arsenal. Although he initially allowed players to have a pint of beer, they were forbidden to <b>drink</b> <b>on</b> days off and in the players' lounge. He later banned his players from casually drinking together. Wenger also promoted pasta as the pre-match dish, encouraged boiled chicken instead of red meat and discouraged junk food. Players received optional vitamin injections and Creatine, which reduced fatigue and improved their stamina.|$|E
