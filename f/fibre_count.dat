40|$|Periventricular {{white matter}} injury (PWI) {{is a major}} form of brain injury {{observed}} in congenital hemiparesis. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the usefulness of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fibre tracking in delineating the primary and secondary degenerative changes in cerebral white matter and deep grey matter in patients with spastic cerebral palsy due to PWI and to look for any possible reorganization of the axonal architecture. Five hemiparetic cerebral palsy patients (median age 14 years) with known PWI were prospectively studied with DTI of the brain at 1. 5 T and quantitatively compared with five age and sex matched controls. Fibre tracts for various corticofugal, thalamocortical and association tracts were generated and analysed for the DTI <b>fibre</b> <b>count</b> and for diffusion parameters. A region of interest based analysis was performed for the directionally averaged mean diffusivity (D(av)) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values in various white matter locations in the brain and the brainstem and in the deep grey matter nuclei. Group statistics were performed for these parameters using Mann-Whitney U-test comparing the affected sides in patients with either side in controls and the unaffected side in hemiparetics. There was significant reduction in DTI <b>fibre</b> <b>count</b> on the lesional side involving corticospinal tract (CST), corticobulbar tract (CBT) and superior thalamic radiation in the patient group compared with controls. Also there was an increase in DTI <b>fibre</b> <b>count</b> in the unaffected side of the hemiparetic patients in CST and CBT, which reached statistical significance only in CBT. The corpus callosum, cingulum, superior longitudinal fasciculus and middle cerebellar peduncle failed to show any significant change. ROI measurements on the primary site of white matter lesion and the thalamus revealed a significant increase in D(av) and decrease in FA, suggesting primary degeneration. The CST in the brainstem, the body of corpus callosum and the head of caudate and lentiform nuclei showed features of secondary degeneration on the affected side. The CST on the unaffected side of hemiparetics was found to have a significant decrease in D(av) and an increase in FA. Thus the degeneration of various motor and sensory pathways, as well as deep grey matter structures, appears to be important in determining the pathophysiological mechanisms in patients with congenital PWI. Also evidence suggesting the reorganization of sensorimotor tracts in the unaffected side of spastic hemiparetic patients was noted. status: publishe...|$|E

The subjects had been exposed mainly to crocidolite asbestos {{for an average of}} 2. 8 (range 0. 2 - 13) years in 1950 - 75. The mean (median) total <b>fibre</b> <b>count</b> (of asbestos bodies and uncoated fibres) per ml of BAL fluid was 5500 (2800) by TEM and 2900 (1000) by SEM. The mean (median) count of asbestos bodies per ml with LM was 810 (500) with cytocentrifugation and 750 (480) with Millipore filtration, 840 (320) by TEM, and 1750 (420) by SEM. The mean proportion of coated fibres was 35 % by TEM and 45 % by SEM. The mean length of the coated fibres was 22 (range 4 - 65) microns by TEM and 34 (range 4. 5 - 170) microns by SEM. The total <b>fibre</b> <b>count</b> exceeded 1000 fibres per ml in 70 % of the cases by TEM. Asbestos body counts exceeded 1 per ml in 95 % of the cases by LM.

40|$|A {{round robin}} test {{programme}} was executed amongst several laboratories on the beam test {{recommended by the}} RILEM TC 162 -TDF [1]. In the proposed test method, the mid-span deflection is to be measured {{on both sides of}} the beam (referred to as delta(1) and delta(2)). A systematic fibre counting exercise was carried out on several beam specimens to investigate whether there is a correlation between differences between delta(1) and delta(2) and the fibre distribution. The findings of the investigation suggest that differences between delta(1) and delta(2) are not strongly linked with the fibre distribution regardless of concrete strength. It is likely that this phenomenon arises because the supports and loading points have enough degrees of freedom to accommodate any unevenness on the specimen surface. This reflects well on the robustness of the proposed test method as it means that the proposed boundary conditions are able to adapt and tolerate (to a certain degree) surface non-uniformity. However, it is also suggested that significant differences between delta(1) and delta(2) may be brought about by experimental errors.

40|$|The Small eye (Sey) gene, {{which has}} been mapped to {{chromosome}} 2 in the mouse, is known to cause variable malformations of the eye and nose. The effect of the gene in the heterozygous state is mainly on the eye. A combined electron microscopy and morphometric analysis of the optic nerve in adult littermates with a normal (+/+) and heterozygous mutant (Sey/+) genotype was carried out. The optic nerve could be dissected from the posterior pole of the eyeball to the optic chiasma in all the mice examined. The results of morphometric analyses carried out in this study show that the Sey gene indirectly affects the normal morphogenesis of the optic nerve in the heterozygous mutant Sey male mouse to a significant degree compared with its male normal littermate. The heterozygous mutant Sey female mouse is also affected, but not significantly so when compared with its normal female littermate.

40|$|Background: Mineralogical {{analysis}} of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) by electron microscopy {{could be the}} most suitable method for assessing asbestos exposure. However, it has been claimed {{that there is not a}} standardized or systematic approach to the subject of mineralogical analysis. Objectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate mineralogical {{analysis of}} BALF by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as biomarker of asbestos fibre load. Methods: BALF was examined in 193 exposed workers (189 men and 4 women) and in 84 patients (65 men and 19 women) who underwent diagnostic fibreoptic bronchoscopy for various clinical purposes. Asbestos bodies (AB) in BALF were counted with a phase contrast microscope, while <b>fibres</b> were <b>counted</b> and analysed by TEM. Results: <b>Fibre</b> <b>counting</b> by TEM showed a significant difference in the two populations (two tailed Mann-Whitney U test, p= 0. 0044), since it was positive in all exposed subjects. Only 75. 1 % of the exposed population was positive for asbestos bodies (AB). Subjects who had been exposed over a long time period had higher concentrations of fibres than subjects who had been exposed more recently probably because of higher exposure in the past. Conclusions: The study confirms the results of a previous study on a limited number of subjects. Fibre concentrations in BALF can be considered as a reliable biomarker of past asbestos exposure even after many years after cessation of exposure...|$|R
40|$|The {{difference}} between the melting temperatures of poly(propylene) (PP) fibre and random poly(propylene-co-ethylene) (PPE) was exploited {{in order to establish}} processing conditions for an all PP composite. Under these conditions the matrix must be a liquid in order to ensure good wetting and impregnatin at the fibres, though the temperature must not be too high to avoid metling the fibres. The high chemical compatibility of the two components allowed creation of strong physico-chemical interactions, which favour strong interfacial adhesion. The static and dynamic mechanical properties and morphology of poly(propylene) woven fabric reinforced random PPE composites have been investigated with reference to the woven geometry that influenced the properties of the woven composites. Among the various cloth architectures that were used in the PP-PPE composites, the satin weave imparted overall excellent mechanical properties due to the weave parameters, such as high float length and <b>fibre</b> <b>count,</b> low interlace point and crimp angle,etc. Morphology of the composite has been investigated by macro photography and scanning electron microscopy.

Morphometric parameters examined were mean nerve cross-sectional area (csa), mean myelinated nerve <b>fibre</b> <b>count,</b> mean myelinated nerve fibre density and myelinated nerve fibre size distribution. The findings revealed that the optic nerve continues to develop well into adult life. Growth in calibre was very rapid during the early stage of postnatal life, but progressively slowed with age thereafter. No myelinated nerve fibres were observed before the 5 th day of postnatal life. Similarly, once myelination was initiated, it progressed very rapidly during the early stage of postnatal development and, as for the csa, it slowed thereafter. Peak level of myelination within the optic nerve, which corresponded with the age when {{the maximum number of}} myelinated nerve fibres, i. e. 94213 +/- 1799 (S. E.

Necropsy material from 55 patients who had died from asbestos related diseases was analysed independently by phase contrast microscopy and electron microscopy. As expected the number of fibres identified using electron microscopy was higher than that identified by light microscopy. By adjusting the electron allow for the limited resolving power of the light microscope, however, a significant correlation of the number of fibres identified using the two methods was obtained. The best correlation was found with specimens containing crocidolite (correlation coefficient 0. 79) and amosite (correlation coefficient 0. 74), while chrysotile gave a much lower correlation (correlation coefficient 0. 15). The cumulated fibre diameter distribution obtained using the electron microscope suggests that the light microscope is able to visualise only 5 % of crocidolite, 26. 5 % of amosite, and 0. 14 % of chrysotile present in lung tissue.

40|$|Using a {{computer-assisted}} image analyser, an immunohistochemical quantification {{method of}} substance P-like immunoreactivity (SPLI) in laminae I + II of spinal dorsal horn was established {{and applied to}} 13 patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA) with no disturbance of pain sensation, including olivo-ponto-cerebellar atrophy and striatonigral degeneration, and 13 neurologically normal controls. To investigate whether alteration of SPLI is related to an autonomic disorder, myelinated <b>fibre</b> <b>counts</b> of the fourth thoracic ventral roots were performed. Eleven of 13 MSA patients showed {{a significant decrease in}} small and large myelinated fibres, and were diagnosed with definite Shy- Drager syndrome (SDS), with the exception of two who had no apparent history of autonomic dysfunction. SPLIs in laminae I + II in 10 of these 11 patients, when adjusted for age, were significantly decreased at both levels of the fourth thoracic and third lumbar spinal segments. The results suggest the disorder of SP-containing synapses of primary afferent neurons and/or those of interneurons in SDS...|$|R
40|$|The lungs from 13 {{cases of}} diffuse pleural {{fibrosis}} {{associated with a}} history of exposure to asbestos were examined. Samples were taken from the visceral pleura and central and subpleural zones of the lungs for histopathological and mineralogical studies. The fibre type, size, and number were estimated for each of these regions by transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive x ray analysis. Amphibole <b>fibre</b> <b>counts</b> were raised when compared with a non-occupationally exposed group and matched those seen in cases of pleural plaques, mild asbestosis, and mesothelioma. A wide case to case variation of distribution was seen. No significant difference was apparent between central and subpleural zones, whereas low asbestos counts were found in the pleura; these were mainly short chrysotile fibres. Within the lungs more (45 %) of the longer (greater than 4 microns) and thinner (less than 0. 25 micron) amphibole fibres were retained in keeping with other studies implicating such fibre profiles in the pathogenesis of asbestos related disease...|$|R
