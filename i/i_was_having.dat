[...] A press conference was held during the Marché International du Disque et de l'Edition Musicale (MIDEM) in Cannes, France, on January 19, 2002, where Spears also premiered the film.|$|E

500|$|Betrayal {{received}} mixed-to-positive reception, including {{praise for}} its {{fidelity to the}} series in terms of gameplay, art style, and graphics. Levi Buchanan of IGN called it [...] "the real deal third game in the killer franchise". Similarly, Matt Paprocki of Blogcritics wrote, [...] "Betrayal is a full-fledged extension of the God of War franchise, and it earns its title". He said it is [...] "one of the best mobile games you’ll ever play, and has truly made the format a relevant part of the current video game scene." [...] In regards to violence, Chris Antista of GamesRadar stated that it is [...] "quite possibly the goriest thing your mobile's ever seen". Although not a [...] "revolutionary experience", Pocket Gamers Will Freeman said [...] "it is a thoroughly impressive, utterly solid release that mobile platform fans will relish."

500|$|In early 2001, Spears and {{her team}} {{developed}} a script for a movie where the singer could be the main role.

[...] "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman", written by Dido, Max Martin and Rami, was originally intended to be included on the movie's soundtrack, but after JIVE Records decided not to release a soundtrack, Spears later decided to use it on her third studio album, Britney (2001).|$|E
500|$|Baseball people revere Hoffman for how {{he treats}} people. [...] Ausmus says Hoffman {{goes out of}} his way to engage fans. [...] Beyond shaking hands or signing autographs, he has {{extended}} conversations with fans who want to talk baseball. When Hoffman passed on the Indians in free agency to stay with the Padres, he still sent an autographed jersey as a baby gift to then-Indians manager Eric Wedge. After Hoffman saved the game to clinch the NL West on the last day of the 1996 season, he called Randy Smith, who traded for Hoffman as Padre GM before moving on to the Detroit Tigers. [...] "Randy, I wish you were here", Hoffman said. [...] "You're a part of this." [...] While celebrating his record setting 479th save against the Pirates, Hoffman tipped his cap to the Pittsburgh dugout, particularly Pirates manager Jim Tracy, who managed Hoffman in Cincinnati's Double-A Chattanooga farm team in 1991 after he was converted to a pitcher. Despite losing his role as a closer in his final season, Hoffman took pleasure in supporting his teammates and [...] "not being a cancer just because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> trouble." ...|$|E

500|$|The track's lyrics, {{structured}} in verse–chorus form and written in second person narrative, predominantly feature a sarcastic tone. They {{were inspired by}} Williams' decision to move from Nashville to Los Angeles. She considered this idea after feeling overwhelmed by the repercussion, in Nashville, of Josh and Zac Farro's departure from Paramore. Williams said, [...] "I took off for L.A. {{as if it was}} going to be some kind of paradise or saving grace. I got there and realized that my problems were following me. Okay, so <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> a bad six months? Get over it. [...] " [...] The song was penned as a message regarding her behavior, in order for her to cope with her decision. She stated, [...] "No one else was saying that to me, so I had to say it to myself." [...] musicOMH's Thomas Ingham interpreted its lyrics as focusing on a [...] "serious 'all alone in the world'" [...] theme, while Corvallis Gazette-Timess journalist called them [...] "blunt" [...] and wrote that they discuss [...] "growing up". The writer also believed that its theme would make the song a prominent track at graduation ceremonies. Atilano viewed a contrast between the song's melody and lyrical content. However, he noted that its [...] "sunny" [...] sonority made it [...] "pleasant" [...] to hear.|$|E
500|$|Tim Cain, Fallout and Fallout 2 game director, {{praised the}} art {{direction}} {{and the attention}} to details in the game, but didn't {{like the way the}} endings were not enough constructed around player's actions and decisions. He was also critical of how the game recycled plot elements from the first two games such as Super Mutants and Enclave, saying that if his company, Troika Games, had acquired the license, he would {{have come up with a}} completely original story for the East coast. Chris Avellone, Fallout 2 main writer, described the game to have [...] "enough options and tools at my disposal to insure <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> fun no matter what the challenges", praising the immersion in the Fallout's world, the successful to take the legacy of the previous two chapters, and fulfilling open-world component; while he criticized the writing of some characters and some of gameplay's choices in balancing the skills of player character. Will Tuttle of GameSpy commended the game for its [...] "engaging storyline, impeccable presentation, and hundreds of hours of addictive gameplay". Although Edge awarded the game 7 out of 10, in a later anniversary issue it placed the game 37th in a [...] "100 best games to play today" [...] list, saying [...] "Fallout 3 empowers, engages and rewards to extents that few games have ever achieved".|$|E
500|$|In the quarter-finals Lee {{defeated}} O'Sullivan 5–4 in a {{match that}} lasted 3 hours and 32 minutes. O'Sullivan came from 2–3 down to lead 4–3 before Lee leveled the match. In the final frame O'Sullivan led 36–0, before Lee made a 46 break and fluked a snooker that {{enabled him to}} claim victory. O'Sullivan said his performance was very poor, while Lee said he was quietly confident. White defeated Robertson 5–3 to reach his third semi-final of the season. White led 4–1 and was 56 points ahead in the sixth but missed a straightforward green, allowing Robertson to win on the black with a 67 break. Robertson took the next frame before a risky long pot in the eighth allowed White to win the match. White—who last won a ranking title 12 years ago prior at this event—said, [...] "Everyone knows I've been in front {{so many times in}} the past and tossed it away so <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> nightmares out there". Drago quickly won the first four frames of his match against Hann, conceding the fifth, before completing a 5–1 victory, after which he said the crowd support helped him. Maguire caused an upset when he beat Higgins 5–3, a match that saw Maguire lose the first two frames before winning the next four. After the match Maguire he said he had [...] "starting to think about winning it now".|$|E

500|$|Jeremy Renner, {{who played}} the film's adult Hansel, has stated that his initial {{attraction}} came from a one sheet he was given even before seeing the script, showing Hansel and Gretel walking away and a witch burning at {{a stake in the}} background, which he found [...] "incredibly interesting" [...] (this scene was included in the finished film). He added, [...] "When I read the script, my first thought was, 'I can’t believe this hasn’t been done yet.' It’s such a great idea with so much potential. That dynamic was definitely a big thing, I loved that what Tommy [...] wrote left so much room for character." [...] Wirkola said he wanted Renner in the role after seeing him in The Hurt Locker. Wirkola, who described Hansel as the [...] "loose cannon" [...] of the duo, gave him an additional character flaw of diabetes, in addition to the psychological scars that Hansel shares with his sister (in the original idea for the short film, Gretel was also suffering from eating disorder). Renner said it was a great escape for him [...] "as this was a fairytale with no stress like the other action movies I'd done recently. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> so much fun hanging on a wire like Peter Pan, hanging onto a broom and doing other crazy stuff." [...] He stated, [...] "That {{was one of the most}} fun jobs I’ve ever had because there’s something magical about that old world, fantasy thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Even by the {{standards}} of the British Army, the Regiment (and the 1st Battalion in particular) seems to have gained a reputation during the First World War for profane language. When the 1st Battalion was relieved in the front line following its defence of Delville Wood in September 1916, one of the advanced posts was missed out by mistake. The Lance-Corporal in command, suspecting something was amiss, sent a man back to the front-line trench to investigate. The soldier realised he was at some risk of being shot by his own side, and so [...] "when he had crawled within shouting distance he enquired politely but firmly what —— bastards were holding that —— trench. The 9th East Surreys, who were the troops thus addressed, recognised the North Stafford idiom and let him in unhurt". Bernard Martin, who served as a 2nd Lieutenant with the 1st Battalion, records another incident which probably took place in 1917, when (very unusually) the battalion was addressed at a church parade by a general, who railed against [...] "the disgusting word many of you utter every time you speak. ... I tell you again this indecent word is not to be used any longer. It is so common amongst you that it has become the shameful nickname by which your battalion is known throughout my Division". As the parade ended, one soldier was heard to ask, [...] "What was that bugger gassing about?"; to which another replied, [...] "Buggered if I know, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> a kip.

However, when Seagal rang O'Connell the relationship and understanding between the two was quite difficult and left O'Connell feeling disappointed. Seagal did not understand O'Connell's ironic personality and sense of humour and much of the recorded interview had to be removed from the radio broadcast. The Observer described the interview as, [...] "a spectacularly terrible interview in which O'Connell's questions dropped into a seemingly bottomless well of apathy." [...] O'Connell described the interview remarking; [...] "It was the single worst thing I've ever done on radio.
