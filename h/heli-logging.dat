50|$|Research by Roberts, Ward and Rollerson done in 2004 {{shows that}} post-logging {{landslides}} {{are more common}} after conventional cable-based logging than <b>heli-logging.</b> Landslide rates following conventional logging are {{one and a half}} times more common than landslide rates following <b>heli-logging.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Heli-logging</b> is efficient: {{a single}} S-64 Skycrane can extract 20 000 m3 (about 15,000 tonnes) of clean, {{undamaged}} timber per month. Conventional logging allows the stems to fall. On rocky terrains this {{often results in}} damage to the stems that makes them unusable. On steep terrains falling trees can slide downhill and become irretrievable. <b>Heli-logging</b> allows logging {{to take place in}} more remote places. It also allows certain trees to be logged that previously could not be due to their proximity to a structure or pipeline. These issues make conventional logging less efficient than <b>heli-logging.</b> Logging using helicopters is safer than conventional logging. Falling trees are dangerous for the loggers as well as for surrounding structures or utilities. <b>Heli-logging</b> also extends the logging season. This is {{due to the lack of}} snow load on a standing stem.|$|E
50|$|In general, <b>Heli-logging</b> {{operations}} rarely use the light-weight, single-engine Kaman, {{and most}} operators will select {{one of three}} tested heavier twin-engine helicopter types: the 9000hp Sikorsky S-64F, the 3900hp MIL 8, and the 4400hp KAMOV Ka-32. These three types are most suited to <b>Heli-logging</b> because of structural and systems designs, for example, their twin-engine layout, and dual hydraulic systems. Although the S-64 is an excellent and powerful machine, relatively few have been made, certainly less than 50 total. On the other hand, hundreds of Ka-32s have been built, and the MIL-8s number in the thousands. The Kamov Ka-32A11BC is used for <b>Heli-logging</b> in mountainous areas of western Canada because of its availability {{and the fact that}} it is certified in Canada and Europe for commercial operations.|$|E

50|$|Although {{there is}} no direct cost from road {{construction}} or expansion, <b>heli-logging</b> incurs high costs. Operation of a helicopter as well as the selection processes and methods increase the cost. The use of a helicopter to transport the stems limits the size and weight of the selected trees more than equipment would using conventional logging.|$|E
50|$|<b>Heli-Logging,</b> or Helicopter Logging, is {{a method}} of logging that uses {{helicopters}} to remove cut trees from forests by lifting them on cables attached to a helicopter. Helicopter logging is often used in inaccessible areas of forests. Because the use of helicopters reduces the level of infrastructure required to log in a specific location, the method also helps to reduce {{the environmental impact of}} logging. It also can increase the productivity in these remote areas.|$|E

50|$|<b>Heli-Logging</b> is {{also known}} as {{standing}} stem harvesting which is based on individual tree selection (ITS). The selection process is done by engineers and surveyors. The trees are selected based on demand for specific types and grades. Before the selection process is complete the selected trees are bored to check their reliability. The selected trees are then marked and their diameters are recorded. The diameter of the tree is measured at 1.3 meters above the ground. The sizes of the trees that are selected are controlled by two things. The minimum size is controlled by the economy while the maximum size is controlled by the capacity of the helicopter. Once the trees are selected they are climbed, the limbs are removed and the trees are topped. The length of the tree and the diameter at its top are then recorded. All the recorded data is then entered into a database which calculates volumes, weights, etc. The selected trees are then partially cut at the stem and supported by wooden wedges. The stem is then grappled by the helicopter and pulled until the wood breaks at the partial cut. The logged trees are then brought by helicopter to a predetermined roadside location or dropped into open water where they are collected.|$|E
50|$|Standing Stem Harvesting, a {{selective}} harvesting method within <b>Heli-Logging,</b> {{was invented by}} Philip Jarman of Port Alberni, British Columbia between May and October 1997. The initial harvesting equipment used wire rope or chokers to rig the stem and a modified external hook to engage the choker and lift the stem clear of the stump. In this way, the process of harvesting, which includes climbing, measuring, cutting, rigging, and lifting was pioneered by a single pilot flying a light utility helicopter. In 1998, the inventor supervised the building of an experimental grapple {{which was to be}} operated by a K-Max Lift Truck helicopter. However, because the K-Max had no hydraulics, it was necessary to design and install an externally mounted, jettisonable sled carrying a hydraulic power pack, to operate the grapple.Initial flight trials were carried out using the external hook and wire rope configuration on the 25th of April 1998. In late October 1998, a successful full-scale harvesting trial using a grapple designed by the inventor and funded by the timber licensee was carried out at Lunchtime Lake on Vancouver Island. Press releases and logging industry recognition followed. Patent applications in the United States and Canada were submitted and granted in 2001 and 2002 respectively.|$|E
5000|$|Felled logs {{are then}} {{generally}} transported to a sawmill {{to be cut}} into lumber, to a paper mill for paper pulp, or for other uses, for example, as fence posts. Many methods {{have been used to}} move logs from where they were cut to a rail line or directly to a sawmill or paper mill. The cheapest and historically most common method is making use of a river's current to float floating tree trunks downstream, by either log driving or timber rafting. (Some logs sink because of high resin content; these are called deadheads.) To help herd the logs to the mill, in 1960 the Alaskan Lumber and Pulp Mill had a specially designed boat that was constructed of [...] inch (1.5 in) steel. In the late 1800s and {{the first half of the}} 1900s, the most common method was the high-wheel loader, which was a set of wheels over ten feet tall that the log or logs were strapped beneath. Oxen were at first used with the high-wheel loaders, but in the 1930s tractors replaced the oxen. In 1960 the largest high wheel loader was built for service in California. Called the Bunyan Buggie, the unit was self-propelled and had wheels 24 ft high and a front dozer blade that was 30 ft across and 6 ft high. Log transportation can be challenging and costly since trees are often far from roads or watercourses. Road building and maintenance may be restricted in National Forests or other wilderness areas since it can cause erosion in riparian zones. When felled logs sit adjacent to a road, heavy machinery may simply lift logs onto trucks. Most often, special heavy equipment is used to gather the logs from the site and move them close to the road to be lifted on trucks. Many methods exist to transport felled logs lying away from roads. Cable logging involves a yarder, which pulls one or several logs along the ground to a platform where a truck is waiting. When the terrain is too uneven to pull logs on the ground, a skyline can lift logs off the ground vertically, similar to a ski lift. <b>Heli-logging,</b> which uses heavy-lift helicopters to remove cut trees from forests by lifting them on cables attached to a helicopter, may be used when cable logging is not allowed for environmental reasons or when roads are lacking. It reduces the level of infrastructure required to log in a specific location, reducing the environmental impact of logging. Less mainstream or now for the most part superseded forms of log transport include horses, oxen, or balloon logging.|$|E
