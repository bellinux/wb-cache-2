500|$|The New Directions' {{rendition}} of [...] "Born This Way" [...] was strongly approved by Lady Gaga. On her Twitter account, she wrote, [...] "I really loved Glee Born This Way episode. <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> <b>the</b> show for being brave+fighting for such modern social messaging. Never back down." [...] Gonzalez gave the performance a [...] "B+", and commented that it wasn't her favorite group number, mostly {{because she felt}} the song [...] "wasn't [...] best effort". Berk was less kind about the song, and called it a [...] "crappy but thematically admirable Gaga tune", though he gave it three stars out of five. Slezak gave it an [...] "A−" [...] and approved of the rendition: [...] "it was nice {{to see and hear}} Tina, Mercedes and Kurt on lead vocals—instead of, say, Blaine, Rachel, and Mr. Schue." ...|$|E
500|$|Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris criticized the {{polarization}} of religion {{viewed in the}} episode, noting that [...] "although 'Signs and Wonder's purports to be an examination of different modes of faith, it offers a pessimistic—and distorted view of religion." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a mixed review, writing [...] "I {{have always been the}} type of person who admires the creative attempt, even if the attempt isn't a complete success. [...] This is precisely the mindset I'm feeling after watching 'Signs and Wonders'. <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> <b>the</b> attempt to spook me, to offer up conflicting views of religion and righteousness, even if I'm not completely sure what the point of it all was." [...] Nevertheless, Kessenich praised the snake attack scenes and the episode's occasional quips of humor. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "C+". Despite writing that the snake attack scenes were [...] "surprisingly horrifying" [...] and that the episode contained [...] "plenty [...] to recommend", he was critical about the lack of explanation behind Mackey. Although he had a positive opinion of the first 30 minutes, he wrote that the [...] "last 10 minutes just sink everything good the episode has going, and in a way that hurts everything that came before." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mixed Martial Arts Champion Andrei Arlovski: [...] "The {{pit bull}} {{has a long}} history in America. In the early 1900s the U.S. proudly used pit bulls on WWI posters to symbolize qualities that make up America - friendly, courageous, hard working and worthy of respect. I chose my name because <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> <b>the</b> breed for the same reasons. When I hear about pit bulls being used in dog {{fighting}}, it makes me angry. I have a choice to step into the cage to fight, but these dogs have no choice. Dog fighting is morally wrong and inhumane. In my opinion it's torture. Please join me in Knocking Out Dog Fighting." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rousseau also {{mentioned}} the watchmaker theory. He wrote the following in his 1762 book, Emile: [...] I am {{like a man}} who sees the works of a watch for the first time; he is never weary of admiring the mechanism, though he does not know the use of the instrument and has never seen its face. I do not know what this is for, says he, but I see that each part of it is fitted to the rest, <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> <b>the</b> workman in the details of his work, and I am quite certain that all these wheels only work together in this fashion for some common end which I cannot perceive. Let us compare the special ends, the means, the ordered relations of every kind, then let us listen to the inner voice of feeling; what healthy mind can reject its evidence? Unless the eyes are blinded by prejudices, can they fail to see that the visible order of the universe proclaims a supreme intelligence? What sophisms must be brought together before we fail to understand the harmony of existence and the wonderful co-operation of every part for the maintenance of the rest? ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Stravinsky was not outspoken {{about his}} faith, {{he was a}} deeply {{religious}} man throughout some periods of his life. As a child, he was brought up by his parents in the Russian Orthodox Church. Baptized at birth, he later rebelled against the Church and abandoned it {{by the time he}} was fourteen or fifteen years old. Throughout the rise of his career he was estranged from Christianity and it was not until he reached his early forties that he experienced a spiritual crisis. After befriending a Russian Orthodox priest, Father Nicholas, after his move to Nice in 1924, he reconnected with his faith. He rejoined the Russian Orthodox Church and afterwards remained a committed Christian. Robert Craft noted that Stravinsky prayed daily, before and after composing, and also prayed when facing difficulty. Towards the end of his life, he was no longer able to attend church services. In his late seventies, Stravinsky said:I cannot now evaluate the events that, at the end of those thirty years, made me discover the necessity of religious belief. I was not reasoned into my disposition. Though <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> <b>the</b> structured thought of theology (Anselm's proof in the Fides Quaerens Intellectum, for instance) it is to religion no more than counterpoint exercises are to music. I do not believe in bridges of reason or, indeed, in any form of extrapolation in religious matters. ... I can say, however, that for some years before my actual [...] "conversion", a mood of acceptance had been cultivated in me by a reading of the Gospels and by other religious literature.|$|E

[...] Miyazaki told The Guardian, [...] "I <b>admired</b> those men, <b>I</b> <b>admired</b> <b>the</b> way they battled to save their way of life, just as the coal miners in Japan did.
