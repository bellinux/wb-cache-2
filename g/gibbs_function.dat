The apparatus has been tested by reproducing the vapour pressures and excess <b>Gibbs</b> <b>functions</b> for mixtures of hexafluorobenzene + cyclohexane. Excess <b>Gibbs</b> <b>functions</b> have been determined for hexafluorobenzene +N,N-dimethlaniline, and isopropylcyclohexane. An equilibrium constant for complex formation Kx, has been calculated from these quantities and compares favourably with the spectroscopically determined Kx. Excess <b>Gibbs</b> <b>functions</b> have also been determined for mixtures of pentafluorocyanobenzene + cyclohexane at two temperatures. The solid-liquid phase diagram has been determined for hexafluoro-benzene +N,N-dimethyl p-toluidine and shows {{the existence of a}} 1 : 1 complex in the solid. The liquid-liquid phase diagram for pentafluorocyanobenzene + isopropylcyclohexane has also been determined, and the system shows an upper critical solution temperature. Excess volumes of mixing have been obtained for hexafluorobenzene +N,N-dimethylaniline, N,N-dimethyl p-toluidine and isopropylcyclohexane and pentafluorocyanobenzene +N,N-dimethylaniline, N,N-dimethyl p-toluidine, benzene, toluene and p-xylene. Excess enthalpies of mixing have been measured at two temperatures for pentafluorocyanobenzene + cyclohexane, benzene, toluene and p-xylene. The experimental evidence suggests that strong complexing occurs in solution between aromatic fluorocarbons + aromatic hydrocarbons, and also aromatic amines. In the former case the interaction appears to be mainly of an electrostatic nature, whereas in the latter case the major contribution to the interaction arises from charge transfer forces, the amine acting as an electron donor...|$|R

5000|$|The Massieu {{function}} {{was introduced in}} the 1869 paper “On the Various Functions Characteristic of Fluids” by French engineer Francois Massieu (1832-1896) and is sometimes called Massieu - <b>Gibbs</b> <b>function,</b> Massieu potential, or <b>Gibbs</b> <b>function,</b> or “characteristic function” in its original terminology. The name [...] "Gibbs function" [...] is the eponym of American physicist Willard Gibbs (1839-1903), who cited Massieu in his 1876 On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances. Massieu, as discussed in the first footnote to the abstract of Gibbs' Equilibrium, “appears to have been the first {{to solve the problem of}} representing all the properties of a body of invariable composition which are concerned in reversible processes by means of a single function.” Massieu's 1869 paper seems to be the source for the generalized mathematical conception of the energy of a system being equal to summations of the products of pairs of conjugate variables.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The <b>Gibbs</b> <b>function,</b> which {{depends on}} the {{intensive}} variables T and P, is easier to obtain experimentally than any other thermodynamical potential. However, textbooks usually first introduce the internal energy, {{as a function of}} the extensive variables V and S, and then proceed, by Legendre transformations, to obtain the <b>Gibbs</b> <b>function.</b> Here, taking liquid water as an example, we show how to obtain the internal energy from the <b>Gibbs</b> <b>function.</b> The two fundamental equations (<b>Gibbs</b> <b>function</b> and internal energy) are examined and their output compared. In both cases complete thermodynamical information is obtained and shown to be practically the same, emphasizing the equivalence of the two equations. The formalism of the <b>Gibbs</b> <b>function</b> is entirely analytical, while that based on the internal energy is, in this case, numerical. Although it is well known that all thermodynamic potentials contain the same information, usually only the ideal gas is given as an example. The study of real systems, such as liquid water, using numerical methods, may help students to obtain a deeper insight into thermodynamics. 1...|$|E
