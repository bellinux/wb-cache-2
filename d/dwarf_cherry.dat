Lincoln University {{has been involved with}} this leaders programme since 1979 when it was launched with a grant from the Kellogg Foundation, USA. The project was to establish whether cherries are a viable diversification on a sheep, beef and deer farm in the Teviot valley, Roxburgh, Central Otago. This report analyses the cost structures and returns from traditional cherry growing methods compared with methods for the newer dwarf or “Bonsai” types. The report was also produced to assist others who may be thinking of establishing a cherry orchard and require a reference or starting point to their investigations, giving them an overview of the present status of the industry. While researching this report it seemed obvious that growing <b>dwarf</b> <b>cherries</b> {{would seem to be a}} very viable alternative to the traditional cherry orchard given the possibilities of intensification with smaller trees and ease of management these trees allow. This is wholly dependant of course on good risk management of the orchard, high marketable yields and sound future financial returns. Cherries, as with most horticulture, are certainly not without some risk. A key one looming, especially in Central Otago, is the chronic labour shortage during the summerfruit harvest window. Another issue is how <b>cherry</b> producers, <b>dwarf</b> and traditional together, will deal with the increasing production of cherries that will result from the increase in recent plantings. If you are able to sleep easy with these risk factors, along with weather issues, then I would suggest that cherries could be a very good diversification option alongside traditional forms of pastoral farming. This report sets out the production parameters, cost and revenue projections, and comparisons to other summerfruit, and talks about the principles of root restriction and <b>dwarfing</b> <b>cherries.</b> This should give the reader an overview of where the cherry industry is at present and help them on their way to deciding if cherries are an option for them. This report was not intended to be the definitive guide to growing cherries but instead as a broad overview of all the different facets involved in the industry...|$|R

5000|$|Until the 1970s, {{cherries}} {{were grown}} on the vigorous Malling F12/1, Mazzard (Prunus avium), or Maheleb (P. maheleb) rootstocks, which required much {{space and time}} before cropping began, thus the growing of cherries was not a realistic option on a garden scale.

40|$|In many areas, {{over half}} of all {{diverted}} water is used for irrigation. Tree fruit crops {{use a lot of}} water, but water productivity can be increased using properly-timed precision water stress. In addition to water conservation, increases in water productivity arise from better fruit quality, increased storage life and reductions in pruning and maintenance. One major hurdle to applying precision water stress in orchards is the lack of a reliable, automated method of determining tree water status. However, the influence of physiological characteristics such as rootstock vigor on water productivity are also important. Selecting the most appropriate rootstocks and accurately determining the water status of orchard trees can increase water productivity. Research has shown that some rootstocks can more effectively extract water from soil. In this research, the response to water stress of three different Gisela tart <b>cherry</b> <b>dwarfing</b> rootstocks was compared using a weighing lysimeter system. Gisela 12 and Gisela 3 rootstocks recovered from drought stress more quickly and had higher trunk diameter growth rates than drought-stressed Gisela 5 rootstocks. Two potential methods of determining tree water status were also evaluated. Trunk hydration was measured using electromagnetic sensors and canopy temperature changes were detected using infrared radiometry. Electromagnetic techniques, including time domain reflectometry, can be used to determine the water content of wood. Until recently, the cost of this technology has inhibited its widespread use, but new affordable commercial electromagnetic soil moisture sensors have created renewed interest in this technique. In this research five different types of electromagnetic soil moisture sensors were inserted into the trunks of fruit trees and were monitored over two growing seasons. Maximizing exposure of waveguides to the sapwood increased the response of these sensors to changes in stem water potential. Infrared measurements of canopy temperature have successfully been used with field crops. However, the heterogeneity of orchard canopies makes this technique more difficult in orchards. Here, the efficacy of aiming radiometers at single trees versus at entire orchards was compared over multiple growing seasons. Neither single tree measurements nor whole orchard techniques produced a sufficiently robust signal to recommend them for general use...|$|R
40|$|The genus Rhagoletis Loew {{includes}} about 65 known species {{distributed throughout}} Europe, Asia and America. Most species are oligophagous, attacking {{only a few}} closely related host plants. The European cherry fruit fly R. cerasi is the economically most important pest species in Europe. R. batava and R. alternata can also cause economic damage in Europe. In addition to these species, the American cherry fruit fly species R. cingulata, R. indifferens and R. fausta, {{as well as the}} apple maggot R. pomonella, the blueberry maggot R. mendax, and the walnut infesting species R. completa and R. suavis are pest insects of high economic importance. R. cingulata and R. completa were recently introduced to Europe and are currently spreading in Central Europe. A lot of research was conducted on integrated control of the European cherry fruit fly R. cerasi during the past hundred years. For the monitoring of flight period of R. cerasi yellow sticky traps are used. This method was shown to give reliable results for the timing of application. However, an economic threshold cannot be determined with yellow sticky traps, because fruit infestation is also influenced by crop load and weather conditions during oviposition period of flies. Chemical control (Insecticides) of R. cerasi is currently impeded by the withdrawal of “old” organophoshporus compounds (Dimethoate) and the debate on side-effects of neonicotinoids. Attract-and-kill strategies are available or under development: food baits (based on yeast hydrolysate and sugar) are mixed with the organic insecticides Spinosad or Neem. The baits attract the flies, stimulate feeding and thus increase uptake of the insecticide. However, the efficacy of attract-and-kill strategies strongly depends on the attractiveness of the bait which is influenced by climate conditions. Mass trapping by yellow sticky traps combined with baits is used for cherry fruit fly control in home-gardens. However, due to the high number of traps needed to achieve good control, this strategy is too expensive for commercial production. The use of kaolin as mechanical barrier on the fruit surface to prevent oviposition was shown to be effective against R. indifferens and R. mendax. Because kaolin treatments leave white residues on fruit, this method is not used against cherry fruit fly. Recently, it was shown that oil products can also prevent oviposition by creating a slippery layer on the fruit surface. A biocontrol method using the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana has been developed and is currently registered in serveral European countries (product Naturalis-L). This strategy is mainly used in organic production. Another biocontrol strategy could be the use of parasitoids. However, the use of larval parasitoids is hampered by the steadily increasing fruit size of cherries for fresh consumption: parasitoids are no longer able to reach the larvae {{in the center of the}} cherry fruit. The use of crop netting to protect trees is the currently most widely used method of cherry fruit fly control. With the increasing number of <b>dwarf</b> tree <b>cherry</b> orchards covered against rain to avoid fruit splitting, it has become a viable, cost-effective method of cherry fruit fly control. However, for high standard trees this method is not suitable. In this situation, the use of nets for soil covering (to avoid hatching of flies from overwintering pupae in the soil) can be used...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{investigations}} {{showed that}} the sweet cherry trees on most promising dwarfing, precocious and highly productive rootstocks show water deficiency during the hot and dry summer months, which influence the crop and fruit quality in the subsequent year. No doubt that under extremely dry conditions the maximum productivity and efficiency of water usage in woody heterografts can be achieved at harmonized interaction of factors determining the water relations. Those cherry trees are especially concerned, which are grafted on growth reducing rootstocks, as it became actual practice in intensive sweet cherry orchards. The rootstock research and breeding produced a wide series of dwarfing rootstocks for sweet cherry, but the trees grafted on to most promising of them show water deficiency symptoms under hot and dry summer climate. This is typical to the largest cherry growing countries of the world, like Turkey and Iran, but the conditions are similar in certain sites of Hungary too. Knowledge of hydraulic conductivity, hydraulic architecture and water-usage in case of different woody and herbaceous plant is an increasingly important issue. Because of recently occurred climate changes growing numbers of researchers work on the topic. For easy and fast analysis of plant water regime, water potential of plant parts and hydraulic conductivity of soil-plantatmosphere, a special, tool (Hydraulic Pressure Flow Meter) was developed. The usage of HPFM is based on pressure-variance in tracheas. During our researches in high-density cherry orchards we found the otherwise promising dwarfing rootstocks (such as Gisela® 5) far the worst drought-tolerant, contrary to trees on Mahaleb. There is no sufficient information about drought-tolerance mechanism and hydraulic architecture of different rootstocks, thus our research purpose is to compare the above mentioned parameters in case of Prunus avium, P. mahaleb, P. cerasus and their hybrids. Our test trees are all multi-component grafts, which complicate the question even more. Not only rootstocks and scions, but graft unit itself influence transport capacity of stem. Anatomical researches have proved that trachea surface by stem cross section in case of strong vigor rootstocks is double, which suppose smaller resistance to sap flow, comparing to dwarfing rootstocks. Anatomical results itself are not enough to fully understand drought-resistance mechanism of plants, therefore our HPFM researches can approve to achieve wider knowledge of this mechanism and hereby to find appropriate <b>dwarfing</b> and semi-dwarfing <b>cherry</b> rootstocks for the Hungarian site conditions...|$|R

Next it follows up mainly genetic and morphometric methods that haven't {{been used in}} the hybridization studies yet. Crab apple (Malus sylvestris) is the only one wild species in Malus genus in Europe. However in the last few decades these populations are endangered by orchard apple (Malus ×domestica), that originates from central Asia. It often outspreads into the free nature and thereby closer to wild apple plants, that leads to easier hybridization of these two woods. This process leads up to decreasing number of genetically pure crab apple individuals and also to slow hybrid plants expansion. This trend, which was called anthropohybridization, can be observed also in the Prunus genus, where there hybridizes wild species European <b>dwarf</b> <b>cherry</b> Prunus fruticosa with tart cherry Prunus cerasus.
