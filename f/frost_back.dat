5000|$|Cyclops sits in {{a darkened}} room, {{discussing}} his doubts about his current relationship with Jean Grey. It is revealed that his confidante is teammate (and telepath) Emma <b>Frost.</b> <b>Back</b> at the X-Corp offices, Jean and Xavier use their abilities to stall the armed task force, while Fantomex calls on his [...] "partner:" [...] E.V.A., a biological craft resembling a flying saucer, and apparently Fantomex's external nervous system. Sneaking away to an undisclosed hideout, Fantomex reveals the true incident emerging in the tunnel. Weapon XII is the latest experiment in the Weapon Plus program, a human-sentinel hybrid developed in [...] "the World," [...] a time-accelerated laboratory manufacturing new {{ways to deal with}} the [...] "mutant threat."

Helicarrier, Wolverine, Captain America, and Black Widow do a roll-call on the captive supervillains Doctor Octopus, Venom, Abomination, Mandarin, Red Skull, and Wizard. Loki then commands the supervillains to arise {{as they all}} end up overloaded again while being ordered to hop. The constant hopping causes the Helicarrier to fall onto Tony Stark's rebuilt mansion. The supervillains then go on a rampage as Iron Man, Nick Fury, Black Widow, Captain America, Wolverine, and Hulk fight them. Thor arrives with Spider-Man upon finding him whining outside Avengers Tower. Spider-Man claims that he was angsting. Upon taking down Doctor Octopus, Thor traces the Norn <b>Frost</b> <b>back</b> to Loki. Thor brings Iron Man and Spider-Man to Asgard to confront Loki while the others fight the supervillains.|$|E
5000|$|The {{two were}} keen {{competitors}} inside the arena, but few people knew that Frost and Red Rock had an acquaintance {{outside of the}} arena and were quite fond of each other. Frost would visit the bull and Red Rock was said to enjoy <b>Frost's</b> <b>back</b> scratches.|$|R
50|$|The {{track is}} notably sung {{primarily}} by Paul Mullen, with Rob Hawkins and James <b>Frost</b> providing <b>backing</b> vocals, <b>Frost</b> also provides synthesizer parts, {{as well as}} guitar.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{has got to}} be {{done right}} now before the <b>frost</b> comes <b>back,</b> but we're not going to hurt you, Harry," [...] he said. [...] "You'll walk down to the river and fill that kettle up, Charley." ...|$|R
6000|$|I most heartily {{hope that}} your doleful apprehensions will prove unfounded. These changes from muggy weather to slight sharp <b>frost,</b> and <b>back</b> again, touch weak places, as I find {{by my own}} foot; but the touch goes by. May it prove so with you! ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Cannot Be Saved" [...] was penned by Rob Hawkins and {{is about}} paranoia, {{described}} by Rob as [...] "You know, like in the summer when everyone {{seems to be on}} edge and it feels like it could just kick off for no reason". The track predominately features lead vocals from Robin Hawkins, with Paul Mullen and James <b>Frost</b> providing <b>backing</b> vocals.|$|R
50|$|David Frost hosted similar comedy {{shows with}} similar casts. These {{included}} Frost on Sunday in 1968 {{with the two}} Ronnies, Josephine Tewson, and Sam Costa. Frost on Saturday in 1968. There was a reunion show The <b>Frost</b> Report is <b>Back</b> in 2008.|$|R
2500|$|Looking <b>back,</b> <b>Frost</b> has {{admitted}} that he wished he and Lynch had [...] "worked out a smoother transition" [...] between storylines and that the Laura Palmer story was a [...] "tough act to follow". Regarding the second season, Frost felt that [...] "perhaps the storytelling wasn't quite as taut or as fraught with emotion".|$|R
5000|$|Before {{his death}} in August 2013, <b>Frost</b> gave his <b>backing</b> to ITV's remake saying [...] "I am delighted that the Keyhole format is now {{entering}} its fourth decade on TV. I know the pilot show went down very well with the studio audience and I wish Keith and his team {{the very best of}} luck for the series." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1984 <b>Frost</b> went <b>back</b> to Rio de Janeiro and {{by chance}} began playing again, now with Philippe Hemadou {{who played the}} Moog synthesizer, and then with Adriana Dolabella whom Frost taught to play the Bass. Together they formed the band Kazbah {{which was part of}} the {{underground}} scene that started taking off in Rio de Janeiro in the mid-1980s. The band recorded in a secluded farm {{on the outskirts of the}} jungle, using a 4 channel tape with Frost also programming a Dr. Rhythm drum machine. They produced several instrumental tracks several and songs, one of which became a hit and was often played on the mythic Radio Fluminense.|$|R
50|$|Not Accepted Anywhere {{combined}} {{elements of}} dance-punk, indie rock and hard rock. Much of the heavier distorted guitars originally recorded for the album were either removed or made less {{prominent in the}} first release of Not Accepted Anywhere. The band used 3 different synthesisers during the recording of the album - an Alesis Micron, Roland Juno-106 and an Alesis Andromeda. Vocal parts were split between Rob Hawkins who sings the lead vocal on each track, whilst James <b>Frost</b> provides <b>backing</b> vocals and Alex Pennie provides both screams and flat vocals. Many albums tracks have three distinctly separate vocal parts, using call and response style layering.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike its predecessors, the Xperia Z5's body design {{consists}} of an aluminum frame with a <b>frosted</b> glass <b>backing</b> to reduce fingerprints appearing {{on the back of}} the phone. The device carries an IP rating of IP65 and IP68, making it dust and water resistant. The device features a 5.15 in (marketed as 5.2-in) 1080p display with a density of 424 ppi, featuring Sony's [...] "Triluminos" [...] technology.

6000|$|When {{the frost}} grows lusty at sixty below, men cannot long remain without fire or {{excessive}} exercise, and live. So Harrington and Savoy now {{fell to the}} ancient custom of [...] "ride and run." [...] Leaping from their sleds, tow- thongs in hand, they ran behind till the blood resumed its wonted channels and expelled the <b>frost,</b> then <b>back</b> to the sleds till the heat again ebbed away. Thus, riding and running, they covered {{the second and third}} relays. Several times, on smooth ice, Savoy spurted his dogs, and as often failed to gain past. Strung along for five miles in the rear, the remainder of the race strove to overtake them, but vainly, for to Louis Savoy alone was the glory given of keeping Jack Harrington's killing pace.|$|R
60|$|Bill Yohe, {{by way of}} a joke, {{put some}} <b>frosting</b> down the <b>back</b> of Cy Hurd, and, by way of {{delicate}} attention to Ella, alternately shoved her out of the seat and pulled her back again, while Joe hurled a chicken-leg at Cad Hines as she stood in the entry-way. Will Kinney told Sary Hines for the fourth time how his team had run away, interrupted by his fear that some kind of pie would get away untasted.|$|R
25|$|When {{the time}} {{traveling}} mutant Trevor Fitzroy unleashes the mutant-hunting robots called the Sentinels on Frost and her Hellions, Frost places {{herself in a}} psychic coma {{in order to survive}} the ordeal. Her students however, are not as lucky and are killed in action. Frost later awakens in the Xavier Academy. Disoriented, she switches minds with Iceman and escapes but is overcome with grief when she discovers the deaths of her students. Professor Xavier is able to coax <b>Frost</b> to switch <b>back.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The series {{received}} a negative review from Salt Lake Tribune's Scott Pierce, who saw an advance showing and isn't {{a fan of}} the family-based reality genre because of how it exploits children for ratings: [...] "We know these are bad parents on 'Nanny on Tour' because THEY PUT THEIR KIDS ON REALITY TV." [...] (Yes, I was so upset about this I USED ALL CAP on Twitter.) <b>Frost</b> tweeted <b>back</b> at me: [...] "Watch the show. You will see what a positive difference we are making for American families." [...] If this is all about teaching parents to be better parents, use actors. Use re-creations. Don't exploit kids. That will never happen, of course. Because this isn't about helping families, it's about attracting viewers/making money by using those families. I've watched Frost's shows. If I were she, I'd have trouble sleeping at night." ...|$|R
5000|$|The reclusive silver-haired bat {{resembles the}} hoary bat, {{but has a}} [...] "deep {{chocolate}} brown color with a white <b>frosting</b> on its <b>back</b> and abdomen". Its habitat is primarily forested areas in the southern parts of Canada, where it is common and roosts alone in logs or under bark, {{but it is also}} found in grassland. Groups congregate for southward migration in the autumn and winter, though some individuals may undergo torpor and hibernate instead. Its preferred food is small, flying insects, especially moths, for which they forage after sunset in forest canopies or over streams and stagnant waters.|$|R
50|$|General Cooper {{was ordered}} to retire southward upon his depots of supplies, the nearest of which was Johnson’s Station, on the Canadian, about 90 mi from Fort Smith. Shaver’s brigade was put under arms, and moved forward to the river {{opposite}} Van Buren. <b>Frost</b> was ordered <b>back</b> to Shaver’s position, detaching enough artillery and infantry to hold the crossing at Strain’s, 6 mi below Van Buren; and orders were given to remove by boat and wagon, as rapidly as possible, the public property at Van Buren and Fort Smith. At the same time General Hindman telegraphed General Marmaduke, at Lewisburg, to move northward and strike the enemy in flank and rear.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Frost</b> goes <b>back</b> to {{the piano}} and finds sheet music for [...] "Over There." [...] As he begins to play, he appears in the Shamrock Club in 1917. He talks to an army doughboy, who buys him a beer, and grabs a box of matches. Frost accidentally stops playing {{when he goes to}} wipe his mouth, and returns to the present, dismayed. A short while later, Frost goes to the doctor to get his {{stitches}} out and tells the doctor about the piano. The doctor does not appear to believe the story, and Frost himself has momentary doubts. However, he pulls out the matchbox and realizes he is not imagining things. He goes back {{to the piano}}, but is intercepted by the same convict who has been harassing him. The convict threatens Frost, but the guard comes and they run. O'Hara shows up, and Frost tells him about the piano. He tells O'Hara to touch the piano while he is playing, so they can go back together and get even with Shaughnessy in the past. O'Hara does not believe the story either, but watches as Frost disappears while playing [...] "Someone to Watch Over Me". Frost finds himself at Shaughnessy's house in 1928, and Shaughnessy himself comes over, upset over the absence of his regular piano player and the music Frost is playing. Frost says [...] "the union" [...] sent him over to fill in for the regular player, and Shaughnessy decides to invest in a grand piano and send the old one over to the prison for his [...] "friend" [...] O'Hara. Shaughnessy demands Frost play [...] "S'Wonderful", but Frost does not know the song. Shaughnessy begins playing it himself, while Frost is still playing. Frost stops playing and stands up, but doesn't disappear, while Shaughnessy's girl invites him to dance. When Shaughnessy quits playing, he disappears and travels to the prison in the present. Shaughnessy demands to know where he is, and O'Hara tells him he is right where he belongs. O'Hara punches him and knocks him into the piano, which crashes to the ground and shatters into pieces—trapping Shaughnessy in the present to serve out <b>Frost's</b> sentence. <b>Back</b> in 1928, <b>Frost,</b> realizing what's happened, smiles as he stares at the piano which per Shaughnessy's instructions will be sent to the prison.|$|R
50|$|Celeste Noble: Rusty's ex-wife, a publicity-hungry diva who {{possesses}} stellar energy-based powers. Undergoing extensive {{cosmetic surgery}} and receiving her powers from {{a think tank}} known as the Winterbourne Institute, Celeste attracted Rusty's attention by staging fights with supervillains she herself hired. Celeste seems to have married into the family more for the status than for love. She even dallied with <b>Frost</b> behind Rusty's <b>back.</b> It's been revealed that Celeste, much to her own surprise, has genuinely {{fallen in love with}} Dawn Blackthorne, with whom she's been pursuing a clandestine lesbian relationship. Her relationship with Dawn ends after Celeste kills Kitty, Dawn's mother, out of pity, believing her condition could not be cured.|$|R
500|$|References to Shaun of the Dead {{are also}} present in the film. In one scene, Nicholas wants to chase a {{shoplifter}} by jumping over garden fences; however, Danny is reluctant. Nicholas says, [...] "What's the matter, Danny? You never taken a shortcut before?" [...] He smiles assuredly before jumping over {{three in a row}} (according to the DVD commentary, Pegg vaulted over three fences, and a stunt man did a back flip over the fourth). When Danny attempts it, he trips and falls through the fence. This is almost identical to a scene in Shaun of the Dead, including the fall-through-fence gag, albeit with the pratfalling role reverse: in Shaun of the Dead it happens to Pegg's character rather than Frost's, and he falls over the fence rather than through it. The DVD commentary says that <b>Frost</b> purposely looked <b>back</b> at the camera after crashing through the fence, to show that he had done the stunt rather than someone else.|$|R
5000|$|Seitz cited Carl Sagan, {{adding an}} emphasis: [...] "In almost any {{realistic}} case involving nuclear exchanges between the superpowers, global environmental changes sufficient to cause an extinction event {{equal to or}} more severe {{than that of the}} close of the Cretaceous when the dinosaurs and many other species died out are likely.” Seitz comments: “The ominous rhetoric italicized in this passage puts even the 100 megaton original 100 city firestorm scenario … {{on a par with the}} 100 million megaton blast of an asteroid striking the Earth. This is astronomical mega-hype …” Seitz concludes: As the science progressed and more authentic sophistication was achieved in newer and more elegant models, the postulated effects headed downhill. By 1986, these worst-case effects had melted down from a year of arctic darkness to warmer temperatures than the cool months in Palm Beach! A new paradigm of broken clouds and cool spots had emerged. The once global hard <b>frost</b> had retreated <b>back</b> to the northern tundra. Mr. Sagan's elaborate conjecture had fallen prey to Murphy's lesser-known Second Law: If everything MUST go wrong, don't bet on it.|$|R
50|$|During the Forever Evil storyline, Doctor Light's {{body had}} {{unleashed}} energy {{that caused the}} destruction of Washington DC's A.R.G.U.S. headquarters and exposed the A.R.G.U.S. Agents to it. Etta Candy is approached by an energy manifestation of Dr. Light. Doctor Light appears in Los Angeles and is found by people known as the Crimson Men. The Crimson Men take Dr. Light to their secret location, and promise to make him human again in exchange for information on Steve Trevor. Dr. Light heads to Steve Trevor's location and states he must kill him in order for him to live. Killer Frost faces off against Doctor Light. Angrily, Doctor Light warns that if she stands beside Steve Trevor, she stands against him. This is problematic enough, as Caitlin is weak from going without feeding on the warmth of others for so long, and Light's energy is beyond her capacity to process. Doctor Light hurls her into Steve's ice-block, freeing him. While Killer <b>Frost</b> holds Light <b>back,</b> Steve crawls over to an unconscious Cheetah and checks {{to see if she}} has any useful weapons. As Doctor Light attacks Killer Frost, Steve sneaks up behind him and wraps the Lasso of Truth around him. Compelled by its power, Doctor Light explains that he died and then woke up confused. He was told what to do and where Steve would be. The Crimson Men had told him the truth that Arthur Light is dead. Horrified by his own self-realization, Doctor Light disappears in a blast of light energy, leaving Steve, Killer Frost, and the Lasso {{at the edge of a}} crater.|$|R
40|$|Leeching {{has enjoyed}} a good {{reputation}} in the past {{where it had been}} used in various ailments from fevers to flatulence. The present day scientists have limited its role and the leeching nowadays is being used only in microsurgeries to relieve the venous congestion. This study was designed to explore the possibility of revival of the leech therapy (leeching) which is still being used traditionally as therapeutic agent in various ailments. Leeching is not the outcome of the medieval period but has been in use during the times when there was no concept of the disease and medicament. The earliest clearly documented record of leeches being used for remedial purpose appears in a painting in an Egyptian Tomb of around 1500 BC. The journey of the leech therapy reached its zenith in 17 th and 18 th century AD in Europe while as during the Arab era the leeches were used medicinally but only for the bloodletting. During the 17 th and 18 th century AD there was shortage of leeches in certain European countries due to its rigorous use. During early 20 th century AD when germ theory was put forward and medical fraternity believed that every disease has its origin from germs and the era of antibacterial therapy gained a pace, the leech therapy was considered the myth of the past. It was in 1970 `s that the leech therapy was revived by only limited to the microsurgeries to relieve venous congestions. During the 21 st century there were certain studies when the leeches were tried in certain ailments like arthritis etc. and the Food and Drug Authority of USA (FDA) gave permission for sale and use of leeches in USA but limited its use in microsurgeries and plastic surgeries only. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore different diseases where the role of leech therapy can be seen and clinical trials can be started in this direction. Although the researchers in Regional Research Institute of Unani Medicine, Srinagar, Kashmir, India working under the aegis of Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine started the clinical trials for leech therapy in <b>frost</b> bite way <b>back</b> in 1999, but there are certain unexplored areas where leech therapy can prove beneficial and need is to take up the studies on other disease on larger sample size...|$|R
