5|$|Typhoon Saomai, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Osang, was a long-tracked and intense {{tropical}} cyclone that brought flooding rainfall in Japan and the <b>Korean</b> <b>peninsula</b> in September2000. The torrential precipitation in Japan was considered {{some of the worst}} in the past century.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{invasion}} of the South Korea by North Korea, and the subsequent outbreak of the Korean War on June 25, 1950, the United Nations decided to enter the conflict on behalf of South Korea. The United States, a member of the U.N., subsequently committed ground forces to the <b>Korean</b> <b>Peninsula</b> with the goal of fighting back the North Korean invasion and to prevent South Korea from collapsing.|$|E
5|$|The 2003 Pacific typhoon {{season was}} a {{slightly}} below average yearlong period of tropical cyclogenesis exhibiting {{the development of}} 45 tropical depressions, of which 21 became named storms; of those, 14 became typhoons. Though every month {{with the exception of}} February and March featured tropical activity, most storms developed from May through October. During the season, tropical cyclones affected the Philippines, Japan, China, the <b>Korean</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> Indochina, and various islands in the western Pacific.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian Economic Union must {{negotiate}} {{as a whole}} to sign {{free trade}} agreements with other countries. Key players for the Eurasian Economic Union are the European Union, Turkey, Iran, China and the <b>Korean</b> <b>peninsula.</b> The EEU has sought to increase its trade with partners in the Middle East and East Asia in order {{to profit from the}} growing trade between Europe and Asia.|$|E
5|$|The {{group was}} {{reactivated}} again {{just prior to}} the Korean War, on 29 October 1948 at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. It was dispatched to the <b>Korean</b> <b>peninsula</b> where it remained during three campaigns of the war, receiving three campaign streamers. However, as the war became a long, drawn out stalemate and with no need for the military government group, it was deactivated in Korea on 28 October 1951 {{in the middle of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Activated in 1949, the {{regiment}} trained {{for more than}} a year before the outbreak of the war on June 25, 1950. On that day, half of {{the regiment}} led North Korean forces against South Korean troops by land and sea, pushing them back after several days of fighting. Over the next six weeks the regiment advanced slowly down the <b>Korean</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> acting as a forward unit of the North Korean army. Suffering from a lack of supplies and mounting casualties, the regiment was committed to the Battle of Pusan Perimeter as part of a push to force United Nations (UN) troops out of Korea.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 100 {{species of}} mammal {{are known to}} inhabit, or to have {{recently}} inhabited, the <b>Korean</b> <b>Peninsula</b> and its surrounding waters. This includes a few species that were introduced in the 20th century; the coypu was introduced for farming in the 1990s, and the muskrat {{was introduced in the}} early 20th century into the Russian Far East and was subsequently first recorded in Korea in the Tumen River basin in 1965. The Siberian tiger and Japanese sea lion have probably been extirpated from Korea, but are still included in standard lists of Korean mammals.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of the Korean War, Leyte was ordered to the <b>Korean</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> {{arriving}} in October 1950. Brown, an ensign, flew 20 combat missions before his F4U Corsair aircraft came under fire and crashed on a remote mountaintop on 4 December 1950 while supporting ground troops at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir. Brown died of his wounds despite the efforts of wingman Thomas J. Hudner, Jr., who intentionally crashed his own aircraft in a rescue attempt, for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1950 {{after the}} {{successful}} landing at Inchon by the US X Corps {{and the subsequent}} destruction of the Korean People's Army, the Korean War appeared to be all but over. United Nations (UN) forces advanced rapidly into North Korea {{with the intention of}} reuniting North and South Korea before the end of 1950. North Korea is divided through the center by the impassable Taebaek Mountains, which separated the UN forces into two groups. The US Eighth Army advanced north through the western coast of the <b>Korean</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> while the Republic of Korea (ROK) I Corps and the US X Corps advanced north on the eastern coast.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1951 the Korean War {{had entered}} {{a period of}} {{relative}} stalemate. With the resignation of Dwight D. Eisenhower as the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in June 1952, General Matthew Ridgway of the United Nations Command was transferred from Korea to Europe as Eisenhower's replacement. The United States Army appointed General Mark Wayne Clark, commander of the US Fifth Army during World War II, to overall command on the <b>Korean</b> <b>Peninsula</b> {{as a replacement for}} Ridgway.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the battle ended, the United States had moved enough forces onto the <b>Korean</b> <b>Peninsula</b> to roughly equal the number of attacking North Korean forces. For its delaying actions in and around Taejon, the 24th Infantry Division was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation and the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation. The {{division}} went into reserve status while it rested and rebuilt, and the first unit of the division back into action, the 19th Infantry Regiment, moved {{to the front lines}} of the Pusan Perimeter on 1 August.|$|E
5|$|During her career, Philippine Sea served {{first in}} the Atlantic Ocean and saw several {{deployments}} to the Mediterranean Sea {{as well as a}} trip to Antarctica as a part of Operation Highjump. Sent to the <b>Korean</b> <b>Peninsula</b> at the outbreak of the Korean War, she sent aircraft in support of United Nations ground troops, first during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter and then during the Inchon Landings and the Second Battle of Seoul. She subsequently supported UN troops during the surprise Chinese attack and the Chosin Reservoir Campaign. Philippine Sea saw three tours to Korea during the war, receiving nine battle stars for her service.|$|E
5|$|Gyeongju {{emerged as}} a {{railroad}} junction in the later years of the Japanese Occupation, as the Donghae Nambu Line and Jungang Line were established {{in preparation for the}} Second Sino-Japanese War and to exploit the rich resources of {{the eastern part of the}} <b>Korean</b> <b>peninsula.</b> Following liberation in 1945, Korea was plunged into turmoil, and Gyeongju was no exception. Returnees from abroad were numerous; a village for them was constructed in present-day Dongcheon-dong. In a period marked by widespread conflict and unrest, the Gyeongju area became particularly notorious for the level of guerrilla activity in the mountains.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, the Korean War broke out, {{prompting}} the United States {{to intervene in}} the name of the United Nations. President Truman was caught off guard when the invasion struck, but quickly ordered U.S. forces stationed in Japan into South Korea. Truman also sent U.S.-based troops, tanks, fighter and bomber aircraft, and a strong naval force to Korea to support the Republic of Korea. As part of the naval mobilization Missouri was called up from the Atlantic Fleet and dispatched from Norfolk on 19 August to support UN forces on the <b>Korean</b> <b>peninsula.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the Indian Ocean, hawksbills are {{a common}} sight along {{the east coast of}} Africa, {{including}} the seas surrounding Madagascar and nearby island groups, and all along the southern Asian coast, including the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, and the coasts of the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia. They are present across the Malay Archipelago and northern Australia. Their Pacific range is limited to the ocean's tropical and subtropical regions. In the west, it extends from the southwestern tips of the <b>Korean</b> <b>Peninsula</b> and the Japanese Archipelago south to northern New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|On 25 November, the Chinese {{entered the}} war in defense of North Korea. The People's Liberation Army force, which totaled 260,000 troops, flooded into North Korea and caught the Eighth Army by surprise. Chinese forces crushed the UN and South Korean forces with {{overwhelming}} numbers, surrounding and destroying elements of the US 2nd Infantry Division, 7th Infantry Division, and South Korean forces. The 24th Infantry Division, {{on the west coast}} of the <b>Korean</b> <b>peninsula,</b> was hit by soldiers from the 50th and 66th Chinese field armies. Amid heavy casualties, the Eighth Army retreated to the Imjin River, south of the 38th parallel, having been devastated by the overwhelming Chinese force.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Korean</b> <b>Peninsula</b> {{had been}} divided between {{occupation}} {{forces of the}} United States and the Soviet Union {{since the end of}} World War II along the 38th Parallel. Each government sought to prop up a government on its side of the occupation border, and as the Cold War began, tensions rose between the two Koreas. These culminated in open warfare with the North's invasion of the South on June 25. During this time, the United Nations backed South Korea and considered it the only lawful government.|$|E
5|$|They are {{relatively}} abundant from the poles to the equator and {{are found in}} all the oceans. They inhabit the Mediterranean Sea, but not the Black Sea, while {{their presence in the}} Red Sea is uncertain. The shallow entrances to both the Black Sea and the Red Sea may account for their absence. The Black Sea's lower layers are also anoxic and contain high concentrations of sulphur compounds such as hydrogen sulphide. First ever sighting in Pakistan was made in 2017. First ever record on west coast of <b>Korean</b> <b>Peninsula</b> (Yellow Sea) was made in 2005. followed by one on Ganghwa Island in 2009.|$|E
5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War on 25 June 1950, the 24th Infantry Division was the closest unit to the <b>Korean</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> and in July, Red Cloud's company was among the first units into the country. The division was heavily engaged throughout July by North Korean troops as it attempted to stem their invasion of South Korea, and the 19th Infantry saw action in the Battle of Taejon, fighting at the Kum River before being forced out of Taejon.|$|E
5|$|Wukong {{produced}} torrential rains over Japan, peaking at 516mm (20.3in) in Hinokage, Miyazaki Prefecture. Flooding in Kyūshū and the Yamaguchi Prefecture {{caused the}} evacuation of about 300 households. At least 200 residences were left without power in Kyūshū. Two people were killed by rough seas produced by Wukong, and three others were injured in storm-related accidents. A total of seven landslides occurred, one of which damaged several homes. As the storm brushed the <b>Korean</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> it produced heavy rains, but caused no known damage.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the early}} Jurchens had no written records, {{the story of}} Hanpu was first {{transmitted}} orally. According to the History of Jin (compiled in the 1340s), Hanpu arrived from Goryeo {{at the age of}} sixty and settled among the Jurchen Wanyan clan. Other sources claim that Hanpu was from Silla, the state that had ruled the <b>Korean</b> <b>peninsula</b> but was annexed by Goryeo in 935. The same story recounts that when Hanpu left Goryeo, his two brothers remained behind, one in Goryeo and one in the Balhae area. Because the Jurchens considered Hanpu to be the sixth-generation ancestor of Wanyan Wugunai (1021–1074), historians postulate that Hanpu lived in the early tenth century, when the Jurchens still consisted of independent tribes, or sometime between the founding of Goryeo in 918 and its destruction of Silla in 935.|$|E
5|$|Chinese {{historians have}} long debated whether Hanpu was of Silla, Goryeo, or Jurchen ethnicity. Since the 1980s, they have chiefly {{argued that he}} was a Jurchen who had lived in Silla, the state that had {{dominated}} the <b>Korean</b> <b>peninsula</b> until it was destroyed by Goryeo in 935. Western scholars usually treat Hanpu's story as a legend, but agree that it hints to contacts between some Jurchen clans and the states of Goryeo and Balhae (a state located between Jurchen lands and Silla until it was destroyed in 926) in the early tenth century. In Korea, a recent KBS history special treated Hanpu as a native Silla man who moved north and settled in Jurchen lands during the demise of Silla.|$|E
5|$|Following the 25 June 1950 {{invasion}} of the Republic of Korea (South Korea) by its northern neighbor, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea), the United Nations decided to commit troops to the conflict on behalf of South Korea.

However, US forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing since the end of World War II, five years earlier, and at the time the closest forces were the 24th Infantry Division, headquartered in Japan. The division was understrength, and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending. Regardless, the 24th Division was ordered to South Korea.|$|E
