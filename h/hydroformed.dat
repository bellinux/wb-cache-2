40|$|An {{investigation}} of the tube <b>hydroforming</b> process is conducted {{in order to understand}} the effect of pre-bending operation on formability in tube <b>hydroforming</b> and assess the application of the newly developed Extended Stress-Based Forming Limit Curve (XSFLC) method to the prediction of failure in tube <b>hydroforming.</b> Two sets of experiments on straight tube <b>hydroforming</b> and pre-bent tube <b>hydroforming</b> were conducted on tubes manufactured from three steel grades, namely DDQ, HSLA 350 and DP 600, which represent mild steel, high strength steel and advanced high strength steel, respectively. All tubes had the same outer diameter of 76. 2 mm and the same nominal wall thickness of 1. 8 mm, which enabled direct assessment of the effect of material strength on formability in tube <b>hydroforming.</b> For pre-bent tube <b>hydroforming</b> the tubes were bent to 90 degrees before <b>hydroforming.</b> The effect of the increased axial compressive load, termed the end-feed load, on tube formability in <b>hydroforming</b> was investigated. All experiments were simulated using the explicit dynamic finite element code LS-DYNA in order to investigate the accuracy of numerical predictions in the tube <b>hydroforming</b> process. The numerical simulations, validated using the experimental data, were then utilized to investigate the prediction of necking in straight and pre-bent tube <b>hydroforming</b> using the XSFLC method. The formability, burst pressure and corner-fill expansion in <b>hydroforming</b> of the pre-bent tubes was considerably less than that exhibited in <b>hydroforming</b> of the straight tubes. In both straight and pre-bent tube <b>hydroforming,</b> the application of the end-feed load postponed failure and significantly increased internal pressure and corner-fill expansion at burst. The finite element models accurately predicted the results of the tube bending and tube <b>hydroforming</b> experiments. The straight tube <b>hydroforming</b> simulations, validated using the experimental results, enabled accurate prediction of the failure location and tube internal pressure at the onset of necking using the XSFLC method. In order to obtain the XSFLC for each alloy, strain-based FLCs were calibrated using the results of tube free expansion tests. The results of the tube free expansion tests and corresponding numerical simulations also served to validate the tube material properties for the FE models. Straight tube <b>hydroforming</b> simulations were utilized to investigate the effect of friction between the tube and the die on the <b>hydroforming</b> process parameters and necking predictions using the XSFLC method. The validated pre-bent tube <b>hydroforming</b> simulations captured the trends in the increase of tube internal pressure at the onset of necking with the increase of end-feed load using the XSFLC method...|$|R

40|$|The tube <b>hydroforming</b> {{process has}} gained {{increasing}} attention in recent years. Coordination of the internal pressurization and axial feeding curves is critical in the tube <b>hydroforming</b> process to generate successful parts without fracture or wrinkling failure. The stress state {{at a given time}} and location varies with the process history and the design and control of the load paths. A new process parameter, counter-pressure, is introduced to achieve a favorable tri-axial stress state during the deformation process. The new process is referred to as dual <b>hydroforming.</b> The benefits offered by dual <b>hydroforming</b> will be characterized based upon the amount of wall thinning, plastic instability limit and final bulged configuration. An analytical model is developed to analyze the stress and strain state in the part (tube) during the dual <b>hydroforming</b> process. The stress-strain condition analyzed will be used to evaluate and compare thinning for tube <b>hydroforming</b> and dual <b>hydroforming.</b> The effect of applying counter-pressure on the plastic instability of thin-walled tubes with only internal pressure and combination of internal pressure and independent axial loading is considered. Finite element analysis is used to quantify the merits of dual <b>hydroforming</b> in terms of final bulged configuration. A parametric study has been conducted to investigate the effectiveness of dual <b>hydroforming</b> based on the various material properties and process conditions. Dual <b>hydroforming</b> results in different stress and strain states compared to tube <b>hydroforming.</b> The counter-pressure enabled favorable tri-axial stress state during deformation that resulted in different thickness and percentage thinning.

However, <b>hydroformed</b> bellows have lower performance characteristics due to relatively thick walls and high stiffness.

50|$|While {{springback}} {{has long}} been a topic of discussion for sheet metal forming operations it has been far less of a topic of research for tube hydroforming. This may in part be a result of the relatively low levels of springback naturally occurring when deforming the tubes into their closed section geometries. Tube <b>Hydroformed</b> sections by the nature of their closed sections are very rigid and do not display high degrees of elastic deformation under load. For this reason it is likely that negative residual stress induced during tube hydroforming might be insufficient to deform the part elastically after the completion of forming. However, as more and more tubular parts are being manufactured using high strength steel and advanced high strength steel parts, springback must be accounted for in the design and manufacture of closed section tube <b>hydroformed</b> parts.|$|E

40|$|<b>Hydroforming</b> is a {{manufacturing}} process {{that uses a}} fluid medium to form a component by using high internal pressure. Tube and sheet <b>hydroforming</b> has gained increasing interest in the automotive and aerospace industries because of its many advantages such as part consolidation, good quality of the formed parts etc. The main advantage is that the uniform pressure can be transferred to every where at the same time. Forming limit is the limit of the component up to that extent it can be formed safely. While analyzing <b>hydroforming</b> process, it is often assumed that the limit strains are identical as that of stamped sheet metal of equivalent material properties. It is not clear if such an assumption is valid. In this paper the forming limit strains during <b>hydroforming</b> is predicted. A series of tube bulge tests for tube <b>hydroforming</b> and limiting dome height test for sheet <b>hydroforming</b> and sheet stamping processes are simulated by a commercial finite element solver to predict the limit strains.

40|$|The tube <b>hydroforming</b> {{process is}} a {{relatively}} complex manufacturing process; the performance of this process depends on various factors and requires proper combination of part design, material selection and boundary conditions, In manufacturing of automotive parts, such as engine cradles, frames rails, sub-frames, cross members, and other parts from circular tubes, pre-bending and per-forming operations are often required prior to the subsequent tubular <b>hydroforming</b> process to fit the tubular blank in the complex die shape. Due to these pre-hydroforming operations, some of the strains are already developed {{before going to the}} actual <b>hydroforming</b> process. Such developed strains before <b>hydroforming</b> process in the part is called as prestrain. In this paper the study of effect of prestrain on formability and forming limit strains during tube <b>hydroforming</b> is done by simulation by taking the material prestrain value. The forming limit strains of pre-strained tube during <b>hydroforming</b> are predicted.
