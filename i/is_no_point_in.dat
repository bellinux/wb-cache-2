5|$|Back in Arendelle, Anna (who has {{woken up}} from the spell) tried to track down a device known as a wishing star, which will {{have the power to}} bring her and Kristoff to {{wherever}} Elsa is. It was apparently the necklace Elsa had given Anna long ago, Elsa using it to bring Anna and Kristoff to Storybrooke. However, the Spell of Shattered Sight had already begun, and the only ones immune to it were Elsa, Emma, and Anna (Anna because it was already used on her a while ago). Tracking down a note written by Elsa and Anna's mother right before her death, the three bring it to Ingrid. It reads that Gerda forgave Ingrid for all that had transpired and still loved her, Ingrid realizing this was what the prophecy meant by regaining her sister's love. Realizing there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> killing the town now, the Snow Queen kills herself using the mirror, which deactivates the curse, though a bit of it remained in Storybrooke, reinstating the town line, making it impossible to return to town if you are to leave it.|$|E

25|$|Similar {{but more}} complex {{translations}} {{to and from}} algebraic logics are possible for natural deduction systems as described above and for the sequent calculus. The entailments of the latter {{can be interpreted as}} two-valued, but a more insightful interpretation is as a set, the elements of which can be understood as abstract proofs organized as the morphisms of a category. In this interpretation the cut rule of the sequent calculus corresponds to composition in the category. Boolean and Heyting algebras enter this picture as special categories having at most one morphism per homset, i.e., one proof per entailment, corresponding to the idea that existence of proofs is all that matters: any proof will do and there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> distinguishing them.|$|E
25|$|Driving {{through the}} mist, David finds his house {{destroyed}} {{and his wife}} dead. Devastated, he drives the group south, passing destroyed vehicles and seeing a gigantic six-legged, tentacled beast. When they run out of gas, the group decides there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> going on. David shoots the others (with their consent, except for his son who is not old enough to understand) rather than have them endure horrifying deaths. When David is done killing all of them, he is left with no bullet to use on himself. He leaves the car and waits to be killed, but the mist suddenly recedes, revealing that the U.S. Army has arrived, managed to close the portal, and {{are in the process}} of exterminating the creatures. David also witnesses rescued survivors, and restoring order. Among the survivors is the woman who left the store at the phenomenon's onset, completely unscathed and having rescued her two children. David realizes that his group was only moments away from being rescued, aware now that their deaths were premature and in vain, and drops to his knees screaming.|$|E
25|$|In pre-modern times, {{environmental}} issues were not widely discussed, though Ashoka banned {{the burning of}} forests and promoted the planting of trees in his edicts. Bhikkhu Bodhi, an American Theravada monk, has been outspoken {{about the issue of}} environmental crisis. Bodhi holds that the root of the current ecological crisis is the belief that increased production and consumption to satisfy our material and sensual desires leads to well being. The subjugation of nature is directly opposed to the Buddhist view of non-harming and dwelling in nature. Buddhist activists such as Ajahn Pongsak in Thailand and the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement have worked for reforestation and environmental protection. The Dalai Lama also professes the close relationship of human beings and nature, saying that since humans come from nature, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> going against it. He advocates that a clean environment should be considered a basic human right and that it is our responsibility as humans to ensure that we do all we can to pass on a healthy world to those who come after us.|$|E

500|$|The {{mainstream}} {{scientific community}} dismissed Reich's orgone theory as pseudoscience. James Strick, an historian {{of science at}} Franklin and Marshall College, wrote in 2015 that the dominant narrative since Reich's death has been that [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> looking more closely at Reich's science {{because there was no}} legitimate science from Reich." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 2008, Behan {{was cleared}} {{of the crime}} and allowed full use of his home after a chef named Aldo Staiani was {{identified}} as the murderer from DNA retrieved from under Mrs. Abate's fingernails.

500|$|Due to falling crime rates, {{fewer people}} {{felt the need}} to carry a firearm for {{protection}} after 2000. This trend however changed in 2015 following the European migrant crisis and November 2015 Paris attacks. Gun advocacy groups argue that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> banning guns because criminals will get guns no matter how tight the law is. At the same time, however, the rules are deemed to be restrictive enough to prevent criminals from easily obtaining firearms, while allowing upstanding citizens to own them for personal protection. For example, in 2010, a Norwegian terrorist, incited by reports of British newspapers describing Prague as [...] "being the most important transit site point for illicit weapons in Europe", found himself unable to obtain any in the country when preparing for the 2011 Norway attacks. Similarly, a Polish terrorist obtained guns illegally in 1200km distant Belgium, despite living mere 70km from the Czech border. Also, the fact that Czech Republic has a strong tradition in firearms manufacturing and competition shooting contributes to generally moderate attitude to gun control.|$|E

[...] They proceed across the disc, encountering a variety of mythical creatures, most of which lead to near-death experiences for Rincewind. [...] Fortunately for Rincewind, the Octavo spell in his head precludes him from actually dying, resulting in several comic encounters with Death. Meanwhile, a significant power struggle is occurring within the Unseen University. [...] Narrator Brian Cox explains that [...] "in the competitive world of wizardry, {{the way to the top}} is via dead men's pointy shoes... even if you have to empty them yourself". [...] The power-hungry wizard Ymper Trymon (Tim Curry) plans to become Archchancellor. Trymon assassinates several faculty members but is thwarted by the incumbent Archchancellor, Galder Weatherwax, and his superior magical knowledge of the Octavo. Trymon knows there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> deposing the Archchancellor until he learns how to control the Octavo, which is growing increasingly restless as Rincewind (and the spell in his head) moves further away from Ankh-Morpork and into greater danger.|$|E

2500|$|Rosenfeld criticized Richard Cohen {{for writing}} in a Washington Post column that [...] "The {{greatest}} mistake Israel could make {{at the moment is}} to forget that Israel itself is a mistake....

After asking Tobias for a drink, she announces that ‚Äúthere <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> pressing‚Äù the issue of Harry and Edna.

2500|$|A housing {{cooperative}} is normally de facto non-profit, since usually {{most of its}} income comes from the rents paid by its residents (if in a formal corporation, then shareholders), who are invariably its members. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> creating a deliberate surplus‚Äîexcept for operational requirements such as setting aside funds for replacement of assets‚Äîsince that simply means that the rents paid by members are set higher than the expenses. (Note, however, that it's quite possible for a housing co-op to own other revenue-generating assets, such as a subsidiary business which could produce surplus income to offset {{the cost of the}} housing, but in those cases the housing rents are usually reduced to compensate for the additional revenue.) ...|$|E

2500|$|The RAF {{credited}} Brown with {{shooting down}} the Red Baron, {{but it is}} now generally agreed that the bullet which hit Richthofen was fired from the ground. Richthofen died following an extremely serious and inevitably fatal chest wound from a single bullet, penetrating from the right armpit and resurfacing next to the left nipple. Brown's attack was from behind and above, and from Richthofen's left. Even more conclusively, Richthofen could not have continued his pursuit of May {{for as long as}} he did (up to two minutes) had this wound come from Brown's guns. Brown himself never spoke much about what happened that day, claiming, [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> me commenting, as the evidence is already out there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hayek {{disapproved of}} the notion of 'social justice'. [...] He {{compared}} the market to a game in which 'there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> calling the outcome just or unjust' and argued that 'social justice is an empty phrase with no determinable content'; likewise [...] "the results of the individual's efforts are necessarily unpredictable, and the question as to whether the resulting distribution of incomes is just has no meaning". He generally regarded government redistribution of income or capital as an unacceptable intrusion upon individual freedom: [...] "the principle of distributive justice, once introduced, would not be fulfilled until the whole of society was organized in accordance with it. This would produce a kind of society which in all essential respects would be the opposite of a free society." ...|$|E
2500|$|Branson {{started his}} record {{business}} {{from the church}} where he ran Student magazine. He interviewed several prominent personalities of the late 1960s for the magazine including Mick Jagger and R. D. Laing. Branson advertised popular records in Student, {{and it was an}} overnight success. Trading under the name [...] "Virgin", he sold records for considerably less than the [...] "High Street" [...] outlets, especially the chain W. H. Smith. Branson once said, [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> starting your own business unless you do it {{out of a sense of}} frustration." [...] The name [...] "Virgin" [...] was suggested by one of Branson's early employees because they were all new at business. At the time, many products were sold under restrictive marketing agreements that limited discounting, despite efforts in the 1950s and 1960s to limit so-called resale price maintenance.|$|E
