40|$|Anticellulite topical gel {{preparation}} with caffeine as active ingredient needs a penetration enhancer to reach subcutaneous layer. Sodium hyaluronate (NaHA), the {{sodium salt of}} hyaluronic acid, is a hydrophilic polysaccharide derivative polymer. It has ability to enhance percutaneous penetration by loosening the dense of the compact substance stratum corneum. The aim {{of this research was}} to observe the effects of NaHA on caffeine penetration as anticellulite active agent in three types of gel preparation: hydrogel, <b>hydroalcoholic</b> <b>gel,</b> and gel emulsion. Each gel type contained caffeine 1, 5 % and was varied into three formulas. Formula 1 contained HPMC 2 % as gel basis; formula 2 contained HPMC 2 % and NaHA 0, 5 %; formula 3 contained NaHA 2 % as gel basis. Caffeine penetration properties were analyzed by Franz diffusion cell in vitro test using rat skin as membrane. Percent caffeine penetration of hydrogel formula 1, 2, 3 were 9, 41 ± 0, 01 %; 11, 74 ± 0, 13 %; 16, 32 ± 0, 03 %, respectively. Percent caffeine penetration of <b>hydroalcoholic</b> <b>gel</b> formula 1, 2, 3 were 19, 54 ± 0, 02 %; 22, 99 ± 0, 23 %; 7, 42 ± 0, 08 %, respectively. Percent caffeine penetration of gel emulsion formula 1, 2, 3 were 10, 47 ± 0, 19 %; 13, 41 ± 0, 12 %; 18, 42 ± 0, 06 %, respectively. The result showed that NaHA enhanced the caffeine percutaneous penetration properties in various gel preparations, except hidroalkoholic gel formula 3...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the effect of concentration and delivery system on skin permeation of (x-tocopherol ((x-T). Also, the addition of sunscreens and oleic acid on (x-T permeation was studied using an in vitro micro-Yucatan pig skin model. Various delivery systems of (x-T (1 %) were formulated, which included simple solution, gels, emulsions, and microemulsions. The experimental design chosen for this study was a statistical randomized complete block design. (x-T delivery was proportional to its concentration. The <b>hydroalcoholic</b> <b>gel</b> delivered significantly higher amounts of (x-T into the receptor than the other gels used. A microemulsion containing isopropyl myristate emerged as the best delivery system for (x-T among all the systems studied. Pig skin is a suitable in vitro model for studying the permeation of (x-T and possibly other antioxidants, though in vivo experiments in humans are required to further corroborate the data...|$|E
40|$|Background Many women {{experience}} symptoms of cyclical mastalgia, such as breast pain, tenderness, and nodularity. Tamoxifen {{and other drugs}} {{have been used to}} alleviate cyclical mastalgia symptoms; however, their use is associated with potentially serious side effects. The current study compared the safety and efficacy of two doses of a topical gel containing 4 -hydroxytamoxifen (Afimoxifene, formerly known as 4 -OHT) with placebo gel for the treatment of moderate to severe cyclical mastalgia. Methods Premenopausal women aged at least 18 years experiencing moderate to severe symptoms were randomized to receive placebo, 2 mg, or 4 mg of Afimoxifene daily delivered as a transdermal <b>hydroalcoholic</b> <b>gel</b> for 4 menstrual cycles. The primary efficacy parameter was change in mean pain intensity as measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for the seven worst pain score days within a cycle from baseline to the fourth cycle. Results After 4 cycles of treatment, statistically significant improvements relative to placebo were measured in mean VAS score in the 4 -mg Afimoxifene group (− 12. 71 mm [95...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was the {{evaluation}} of lipid nanoparticles (solid lipid nanoparticles, SLN, and nanostructured lipid carriers, NLC) as potential carriers for octyl-methoxycinnamate (OMC). The release pattern of OMC from SLN and NLC was evaluated in vitro, determining its percutaneous absorption through excised human skin. Additional in vitro studies were performed in order to evaluate, after UVA radiation treatment, the spectral stability of OMC-loaded lipid nanoparticles. From the obtained results, ultrasonication method yielded both SLN and NLC in the nanometer range with a high active loading and a particle shape close to spherical. Differential scanning calorimetry data pointed out the key role of the inner oil phase of NLC in stabilizing the particle architecture and in increasing the solubility of OMC as compared with SLN. In vitro results showed that OMC, when incorporated in viscosized NLC dispersions (OMC-NLC), exhibited a lower flux with respect to viscosized SLN dispersions (OMC-SLN) and two reference formulations: a microemulsion (OMC-ME) and a <b>hydroalcoholic</b> <b>gel</b> (OMC-GEL). Photostability studies revealed that viscosized NLC dispersions were the most efficient at preserving OMC from ultraviolet-mediated photodegradation...|$|E
40|$|Several dermocosmetic bases {{even without}} active substances, can {{increase}} the cutaneous hydration, resulting in a beneficial effect to the skin. The evidence and interpretation of possible hydration effect of formulations in the skin can be carried through by means of histopathological and histomorphometrical evaluation, a time that allows {{the analysis of the}} epithelial tissue, of dermis and also of the cellular characteristics. The objective of this research was to evaluate the skin hydration after exposition to the aqueous and hydroalcoholic bases and silicone emulsion. Swines had areas submitted to treatments during 15 days with three different formulations (F 1 - aqueous gel, F 2 - <b>hydroalcoholic</b> <b>gel</b> and F 3 - silicone emulsion). By means of histometric and histopathological techniques were gotten the thickness of the epidermis and stratum corneum. Comparison of means was done using ANOVA followed by the Tukey test. The F 1 provoked significant increase in the thickness of the epidermis. The formulaton F 2 provoked significant reduction in the thickness of the epidermis and stratum corneum. F 3 not presented significant difference in this structures. According to the study, the type of base chosen intervenes with the skin hydration...|$|E
40|$|A {{suitable}} emulgel {{formulation of}} piroxicam was prepared and its percutaneous permeation was investigated using Wistar rat skin and diffusion cell technique. The concentrations {{of the drug}} in receptor phase of diffusion cells were measured using HPLC method. The effect of three types of penetration enhancers (Myrj 52, cineol and Transcutol P) with different concentrations on transdermal permeation of the drug was also evaluated. Flux, Kp and enhancement ratios (ERs) of piroxicam {{in the presence of}} enhancers was measured and compared with emulgel base alone and simple commercial gel. The results showed a significant enhancement in the flux from emulgel base compared to <b>hydroalcoholic</b> <b>gel</b> formulation (9. 91 folds over simple gel). The highest enhancement ratio (ER= 3. 11) was observed for Myrj 52 at the concentration of 0. 25 %. Higher concentrations of Myrj 52 did not show any enhancement in the drug flux due to micelle formation and solubilization of the drug by micelles. The increase in solubility, in turn, increases the saturated concentration and reduces the thermodynamic activity of the drug. Transcutol® P with concentrations higher than 0. 25 % w/w showed burst transportation of the drug through the skin. All concentrations of cineol and Transcutol did not show any enhancing effects over emulgel base alone (ER < 1) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to evaluate the polymer-surfactant and polymer-neutralizer interactions in topical aqueous, anhydrous, and <b>hydroalcoholic</b> <b>gel</b> formulations using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The gels were prepared by dispersing Carbomer (Carbopol 980) in water and ethanol for aqueous and anhydrous systems, respectively. Glycerol and propylene glycol were also added to ensure that the compositions of gels closely resembled those used in typical topical gel formulations. Comparisons of the spectra of Carbopol dispersions in aqueous, anhydrous, and hydroalcoholic systems, performed for the first time, show Carbopol-neutralizer and Carbopol-surfactant interactions vary depending {{on the nature of the}} solvents used for gel formation. Analysis of the spectra of aqueous gel formulations indicates significant presence of ionized carboxyl groups only at higher pH (∼ 8. 0). Drying of the aqueous gels causes a shift in the carbonyl stretch band toward higher energy, suggesting changes in polymer-neutralizer interaction. Anhydrous gels exhibit 2 different carbonyl stretch bands: the one at ∼ 1653 cm− 1 is related to the carboxyl group that is hydrogen bonded and is akin to hydrous gels; the second one at ∼ 1717 cm− 1 is indicative of free carbonyl groups. The carbonyl bands of dried gels appear at different energy levels than the solvated gels. This shift resulting from solvent evaporation, reported for the first time, indicates changes in hydrogen bond characteristics. The results show that FTIR can be a good technique compared with other more time-consuming means of analysis for topical formulations...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} the short-term effects of percutaneous 17 ß-estradiol on blood pressure, metabolic profile and hormonal levels in postmenopausal women with systemic arterial hypertension. After a wash-out period of 15 days, 10 hypertensive patients {{were treated with}} guanabenz acetate to control blood pressure, followed by 17 ß-estradiol {{in the form of}} <b>hydroalcoholic</b> <b>gel</b> administered for 21 of 28 days of each cycle, for 3 cycles. Patients were evaluated before, during and 2 months after estrogen administration. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure or heart rate did not present any significant change in any patient when compared to those periods with the antihypertensive drug only (pretreatment period and 60 days after estrogen therapy was discontinued). Plasma biological markers of hepatic estrogenic action (plasma renin activity, antithrombin III, triglycerides, total cholesterol and lipoproteins) also remained unchanged during the study. Hormone treatment was effective, as indicated by the relief of menopausal symptoms, a decrease in FSH levels (73. 48 ± 27. 21 to 35. 09 ± 20. 44 IU/l, P< 0. 05), and an increase in estradiol levels (15. 06 ± 8. 76 to 78. 7 ± 44. 6 pg/ml, P< 0. 05). There was no effect on LH (18. 0 ± 9. 5 to 14. 05 ± 8. 28 IU/l). Hormone levels returned to previous values after estrogen treatment was discontinued. The data indicate that short-term percutaneous 17 ß-estradiol replacement therapy, at the dose used, seems to be a safe hormone therapy for hypertensive menopausal women. Nevertheless, a controlled, prospective, randomized clinical assay with a larger number of subjects is needed to definitely establish both the beneficial and harmful effects of hormone replacement therapy in hypertensive wome...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{delivery}} {{system on the}} permeation and metabolism of o•-tocopheryl acetate (o•-TAc) was studied in micro-Yucatan pig skin, which closely resembles human skin. Various o•-tocopheryl acetate formulations, including a simple isopropyl myristate (IPM) solution, an o/w emulsion, microemulsions, which diffbred in their oily phase content, and alcoholic and hydroalcoholic gels were made. A suitable HPLC method was developed and validated to separate and quantify o•-TAc and o•-tocopherol (o•-T). Dulbecco's modified phosphate-buffered saline with 3 % bovine serum albumin (DMPBS-BSA 3 %) served as the receptor media to ensure tissue viability and to maintain skin conditions. Finite doses (5 pl) of the formulations were applied to viable pig skin using a statistically approved randomized complete block design. Data were analyzed using Tukey's studentized range test, and interday variability was estimated using an F-test. About 70 % of the active was recovered from the wash, representing the amount adhering {{to the surface of}} the skin. o•-TAc underwent metabolism in pig skin to the active antioxidant, o•-T. The identity of the HPLC peaks were confirmed by spiking studies using known standards. The extent of metabolism was found to be formulation-dependent. No o•-T was, however, detected in the stratum corneum. A higher extent of metabolism was obtained for the IPM solution, a microemulsion containing IPM as the oily phase, and the <b>hydroalcoholic</b> <b>gel,</b> when calculated based on the percent of total o•-TAc permeated in the viable skin. Metabolism occurred in pig skin to the extent of 15 - 20 % in terms of the total amount of o•-TAc permeated in the viable skin and stratum corneum. Thus the topical delivery and metabolism ofo•-TAc were found to be dependent on formulation...|$|E
