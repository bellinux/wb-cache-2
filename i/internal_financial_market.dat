40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} {{problems of}} harmonisation and {{regulation of the}} European <b>Internal</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>Market.</b> The argument is that the current division of powers between the EU and Member States is not achieving sufficient harmonisation to develop an internal market. The obstacles to the <b>Internal</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>Market</b> presented by national regulatory and supervisory regimes remain too high, and the EU minimum standards and mutual recognition regime has failed to lower these barriers sufficiently. There {{is a need for}} broader based regulatory and supervisory institutions, undertaking at a European level what cannot effectively be done at a national level, including providing a system for preventing and dealing with systemic crises and risks of such crises. The European Central Bank may develop a response to the latter, but the establishment of an EU financial market regulator is the better solution. The chapter also addresses some of the agency problems of the decision making process, and the crisis driven nature of regulatory refor...|$|E
40|$|Japan {{followed}} the British {{example of the}} "Big Bang" in April 1998. This move towards "Big Bang" is a unilateral action without requiring any conditions for the policy measures of other countries. This move has many economic grounds. The Japanese financial system has had incentive problems. Financial agents were looking at, or watching, the signals of policy makers and supervising administrative authorities rather than watching the signals of the markets. This created prolonged financial difficulties during the 1990 s. The "Big Bang" {{is an attempt to}} liberalize the Japanese market towards the external world and, thereby, deregulate the <b>internal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>market.</b> Needless to say, political resistance against the process exists by various interest groups. If the "Big Bang" question overcomes the resistance, however, it may work as an effective means of modernizing and revitalizing the Japanese financial system by restoring proper incentive mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Increasing use of {{securities}} and collaterals in transactions brings the legal ambiguity in today’s financial markets which {{are trying to}} globalise. It should have been noted that without legal certainty an achievement can not be obtained in a complete manner. To solve this legal ambiguity in financial markets, reform movements have been started through out the world from different groups, institutions and communities involving both jurists and practitioners., The Directive on settlement finality in payment and securities settlement systems and the Directive on financial collateral arrangements were adopted. These two directives are both supplementary legislations for the Directive of the Parliament and of the Council on the reorganisation and winding up of credit institutions dated 4 April 2001. All of these directives are the circles of a chain that aim the proper functioning of the <b>internal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> in European Union. In this study, mainly the Collateral Directive will be taken into account. Firstly, {{the necessity of a}} harmonised collateral law and the aims of the Collateral Directive will be handled. Following, the main provisions of the directive will be analysed in details. While analysing in details, the different implementations of the directive in member states will be mentioned. Finally, the conflict of laws clause and the consequences of the directive will be explained...|$|E

They invest up to. 39 ¬ more per extra euro of collateral, and they finance this additional investment by issuing more debt. This result is obtained by looking at the specific case of the Ile de France real estate bubble of the 90 s, which we use as a natural experiment providing exogenous variations in land value. Consistent with the view of efficient internal capital markets, we find that the effect collateral on corporate investment is limited to stand-alone firms. <b>Internal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>markets,</b> real estate bubble...|$|R
40|$|How does {{financial}} integration impact capital accumulation when countries {{differ in the}} efficacy of <b>internal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>markets?</b> We examine this question within a two-country incompletemarkets model featuring a specific financial friction: agents face uninsurable idiosyncratic risk in their investment, or entrepreneurial, opportunities. Under financial autarchy, the South (the country with the least developed risk-sharing possibilities) features a higher precautionary motive for saving and a lower risk-free rate, but also a lower capital stock and lower output. Upon {{financial integration}},capital flies out of the poor, capital-scarce South, causing a prolonged deep in domestic activity. At the same time, the rich, capital-abundant North runs large currentaccount deficits and enjoys a prolong boom. However, these effects are more than reversed in the long run: as time passes, capital starts flowing back into the South, eventually leading to higher domestic activity than under autarchy. Taken together, these results help explain the emergence of global imbalances while also providing a distinct policy lesson regarding the intertemporal {{costs and benefits of}} financial integration. ...|$|R

40|$|Even though Ottoman Empire {{received}} foreign {{loans in}} the late period, it paid by suffering from these loans and went bankrupt. The difficult thing to the empire was inability to balance incomes and expenditures in the long term. Until the mid- 19 thcentury Ottoman State tried {{to work out the}} financial difficulties by using its own sources, but there had been no stability. The fact that inability to pay or relieve financial burdens emerging especially in war times made debasement a current issue. Debasement and inflations prevent the <b>financial</b> <b>markets</b> which were based on trust and could give credits from rallying. As a matter of fact, in the period of internal debt, especially between 1770 - 1876, <b>internal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>markets</b> could not overcome the results of debasement and inflation. In this troubled period, on account of inability to restore the fiscal balance in long term, internal debt as an alternative solution was unworkable and the process of external debt in the Ottoman Empire started with the Crimean War. Nevertheless, Ottoman could not restore the fiscal balance after 1850 s and the process of external loan culminated in stopping payments between 1875 and 1876 and the establishment of the Ottoman Public Debt Administration (Düyun-u Umumiye) in 1881. The external loans were used as a tool to transfer the resources of country to foreigners and also these loans were not spent on reproduction. The externals debts spent on the current expenditures of government not only grew cumulatively but also resulted the fact that foreigners distrained the remarkable portion of public incomes...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{crisis has}} shown that the {{inconsistent}} design of the Euro area had previously produced financial convergence, not integration. The crisis increased fragmentation thus further exposing the limits of the single monetary policy. The absence of a common fiscal authority impedes the birth of a single European <b>financial</b> <b>market,</b> which being at the centre of the European project would require financial operators to refer to a single risk-free yield curve. The recent reforms and the proposals contained in the report of the five presidents do not mark significant progresses towards making the overall design consistent with the production of the <b>internal</b> single <b>financial</b> <b>market.</b> We propose that by issuing debt certificates encompassing the entire maturity spectrum the European Central Bank might provide for a single risk-free yield curve.

We show in this paper, using a dynamic setting, that partially implementing the apparatus of inflation targeting by the PBC to improve the performance of monetary policy encounters various difficulties from out-of-equilibrium dynamics to macro-economic and financial instability. In this context, some macro-economic measures can be helpful for reducing disequilibrium.

40|$|The {{narrative}} {{within this}} chapter {{is built around}} the twin agencies of the FSA and the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) and their role in AML, recognising that both agencies now exist in a different form. Thus we consider the ‘matrimonial’ relationship between the regulators and the regulated entity that is <b>internal</b> to the <b>financial</b> <b>markets.</b> We further consider how both relate to the police enforcement agency, an agency that is external to the <b>financial</b> <b>markets</b> and in our metaphor is the silent jealous lover. It is the external enforcement agency that we suggest {{to be the ultimate}} beneficiary of the outcome of their joint compliance effort. This is played out through the regulatory ‘rituals’ that define the terms of engagement for the different sides, where each knows the rules, how they should be adhered to and both benefit from their continued existence; tending towards a mutual support for the status quo. Indeed, their relationship can be viewed as that of a married couple where the initial ardour has long since departed but they stay together in mutual tolerance because their history is jointly constructed and co-dependent such that one could no longer envisage life without the other. It considers evidence from a range of material taken from public sources and uses for illustration, previously unpublished data that has been collected from three semi structured interviews that were conducted in June and July 2009 with Money Laundering Reporting Officers (MLROs) based respectively, in a financial institution, a firm of accountants and from within the gaming industry.

This paper uses in-depth interviews with executives at ethnic-Chinese foreign-bank offices in Los Angeles to consider the comovement of people and money. We find that understanding the causes and consequences of this comovement requires adding both ethnic and macrostructural layers to discussions of financial globalization. The forces that have led to the rise of a Chinese-American banking sector and to the opening of twenty-one Chinese foreign-bank offices in Los Angeles are intertwined: immigration from the Chinese diaspora to the USA, the growth trajectory and financial transformation of East Asia, and the financial and economic evolution of Los Angeles. Ethnic-Chinese foreign-bank offices in Los Angeles have dual roles: they function both as global outposts managing their headquarters' cross-border financial flows, and as localized institutions that are gradually becoming incorporated into Southern California's <b>internal</b> banking and <b>financial</b> <b>markets.</b> Foreign and domestic ethnic-Chinese banks play complementary roles in facilitating ethnic-Chinese economic development in Southern California.
