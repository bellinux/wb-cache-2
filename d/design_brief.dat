25|$|From the 1920s, London was {{surrounded}} by a number of large freight Marshalling yards, where long distance freight was brought and re-organised into new trains for onward transmission to its destination. Three of these yards, at Feltham, Norwood and Hither Green were operated by the Southern Railway. The requirement for a fast freight transfer locomotive between these yards, and across London to other railway yards provided a challenge for Richard Maunsell. The electrified suburban lines were busy with commuter traffic that took priority over freight workings, and the London network abounded in junctions and signal stops. The <b>design</b> <b>brief</b> called for a powerful locomotive with good acceleration and adhesion. One that was able to climb the steep gradients over the flying junctions that were to be found all over the Southern Railway's London network. The ability to operate over tight curves and be able to move from a standstill on the aforementioned gradients were also key considerations that needed to be incorporated into the design. A tank locomotive design was also preferable since the journeys were relatively short, and the work would involve frequent changes in direction.|$|E

500|$|The {{basis of}} the Leader {{originated}} from a 1944 review of the Southern Railway's steam locomotive fleet, resulting in a Southern Railway <b>design</b> <b>brief</b> which called for a high-powered locomotive requiring little maintenance to replace the ageing fleet of M7 class tank engines. The brief also stipulated that the locomotive would be used on both passenger and freight trains, requiring high route availability. Bulleid proposed an initial design [...] based on his SR Q1 class locomotive, which had proved easy to maintain in service. As the proposal progressed, Bulleid saw that certain tasks required with conventional steam locomotives could be eliminated by adopting some {{of the features of}} the contemporary Southern electric locomotives. However, one of the subsequent designs of a 0-4-4-0 wheel arrangement had an unacceptably high axle-loading of , which increased the risk of damaging the Southern Railway's track. By developing the proposal further, Bulleid settled for a 0-6-0+0-6-0 design of bogied tank locomotive, which spread the weight more evenly over the rails and reduced the axle-loading.|$|E

The sector employs over 3 million people in a multitude of roles representing 8 % of UK employment and a significant proportion of construction employees. The construction industry operates in stages and one of which is the pre-design stage. The pre-design stage is an important phase of the construction process because this is where the client brief is written up and major decisions are made. An effective client briefing process is important to the attainment of client objectives with respect to time, cost and quality for construction projects. Through a critical review of literature. Research shows that despite several research conducted in the area of knowledge management, it has unfortunately, not been matched by parallel empirical research on the processes, challenges and benefits of knowledge capture (KC) in the <b>design</b> <b>briefing</b> process within the construction industry.

2500|$|Development of the V10 series Camry and Vista {{began in}} August 1977 {{following}} the 1973 oil crisis and would later cover the 1979 crisis.

The industry also began wide-scale switching from the rear-wheel-drive layout to the lighter and more compact front-wheel-drive {{in the interest of}} increased fuel economy. With a development focus on exports, particularly to the US, Toyota designed Camry to replace the Corona T130 in many overseas markets. It needed to compete with the compact, front-drive Honda Accord sedan from Japan. Via one-upmanship, Camry exceeded the Accord's wheelbase by [...] and offered larger engines. The <b>design</b> <b>brief</b> also established the compact front-wheel-drive X platform vehicles by General Motors in the US as competitors.

Furthermore, by situating the fuel tank underneath the back seat, luggage space is increased. The styling of the V10 followed the box-shaped trends characteristic of the early 1980s. Wind tunnel testing led to the fitment of drag-reducing flush pillars, a flat roofline to reduce wind buffeting, and one-piece front bumper with air dam to direct air flow. Drag coefficient is quoted at [...] for the sedan and [...] for the liftback.|$|E
2500|$|Finnish architects, {{primarily}} Alvar Aalto, {{have had}} a significant influence outside Finland. Distinguished Portuguese architect Álvaro Siza Vieira, British architect Colin St John Wilson and American architects Richard Meier, Robert Venturi and Steven Holl have each expressed the influence of Aalto on their work. Indeed, Holl has had the opportunity on two occasions to build next to Aalto buildings, with his competition-winning entry for the Helsinki Museum of Contemporary Art, named after his entry titled Kiasma (1993–98), built close to Aalto's Finlandia Hall, and Simmons Hall at MIT (2002) in Cambridge, USA, built opposite Aalto's Baker House (1947–49). But before Aalto, the first significant event in direct influence was Eliel Saarinen emigrating to the USA in 1923 - after having received second prize in the Chicago Tribune Tower competition of 1922 - where {{he was responsible for}} the design of the campus for the Cranbrook Academy of Art, Michigan. Often dubbed as the [...] "Architect of the American Century", Eero Saarinen (1910–61), although born in Finland, the son of Eliel Saarinen, was raised and educated mostly in the United States, and created significant pieces of architecture throughout the United States, from the TWA Flight Center at New York's Kennedy Airport to the Gateway Arch over St. Louis - the style of each building varying considerably depending on the context and <b>design</b> <b>brief.</b> With his popularity, Saarinen was able to influence the choice of architecture in line with his own, as he did in the selection of Jorn Utzon's entry for the competition for the Sydney Opera House, Australia, {{as well as in the}} selection of Finnish architect Viljo Revell's entry for the competition for Toronto City Hall, Canada (1958–65). Another Finnish architect to find creative success after emigrating was Cyril Mardall (born Cyril Sjöström, son of notable architect Einar Sjöström); he emigrated to England and in 1944 went into partnership with F. R. S. Yorke and Czech emigre Eugene Rosenberg to form the architectural firm Yorke Rosenberg Mardall, better known as YRM. A specialist in prefabricated timber houses, learnt from Finland, among Mardall's notable works are housing for Stevenage and Harlow new towns, as well as the Finnish Lutheran Missionary Church in London (1958).|$|E
40|$|Empathising {{with future}} users is {{considered}} crucial in design but also challenging. Often designers have no {{direct access to}} the perspectives of those they are designing for. To involve future users’ diverse perspectives in the design process, different design disciplines have developed a gamut of techniques, which are largely unknown in architectural design. It is hypothesised that certain techniques have value for architecture as well, but need tailoring to architectural practice. The aim {{of this paper is to}} outline opportunities for introducing future users’ perspectives in architectural design. Preliminary results of an empirical study of architectural practice in Flanders (Belgium) indicate that architectural design is a specialist-oriented discipline, characterised by a particular subject, client relationship, firm size and project scale.
