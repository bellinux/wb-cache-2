5|$|The first Australian <b>fighting</b> <b>patrol</b> into Kalimantan {{began on}} 24 May with two platoons, 5 and 11 Platoons, from B Company and a forward {{observation}} party, departing the company base at Bukit Knuckle {{under the command}} of Major William Broderick. The patrol—designated Operation Article—involved an ambush patrol along the bank of the Sungei Koemba river. After several days of careful and laborious movement through the thick jungle Broderick established a patrol base on the high ground overlooking the river on 26 May and sent forward a small reconnaissance party of three men with Lieutenant Patrick Beale. The forward element subsequently detected a party of Indonesians in a re-entrant below, talking loudly and firing random shots, seemingly unaware of the proximity of the Australians and unconcerned with basic notions of security.|$|E
5|$|By dawn it {{was clear}} that they had succeeded in {{penetrating}} the perimeter through a gap between the Australian platoons, and they began to engage them with machine-guns from a defilade position covered from fire by a steep dip in the ridgeline, and concealed by thick scrub. In the growing light, 1 and 3 Platoon were soon pinned down and suffered a number of casualties as they attempted to gain better fire positions with which to engage their attackers. At 06:00 a <b>fighting</b> <b>patrol</b> was dispatched to make contact with Company Headquarters, and as the section passed over a false crest on their way down the spur line they encountered the Chinese positions by chance. Attacking immediately, six Chinese were killed for the loss of one Australian, and the threat to A Company was eliminated. O'Dowd then launched a counter-attack with 3 Platoon assaulting the Chinese occupying the original 1 Platoon position. By 07:00 they had regained the feature and the Chinese were forced to withdraw under heavy fire from the Australians on the high ground, who again exacted a heavy toll. The night's fighting had cost A Company dearly however, and among the dead were the two New Zealand forward observers. In total they suffered more than 50 casualties—half their original strength. Meanwhile, on the right flank, D Company—under Captain Norm Gravener—held the summit of Hill 504 and was not heavily engaged during the night, while C Company—commanded by Captain Reg Saunders—was attacked only once.|$|E
25|$|On 10 November 1944, Rifleman Thaman Gurung {{was acting}} as a scout to a <b>fighting</b> <b>patrol.</b> It was {{undoubtedly}} due to his superb gallantry that his platoon was able to withdraw from an extremely difficult position without many more casualties than were in fact incurred and that some very valuable information was obtained {{which resulted in the}} capture of the feature three days later. The rifleman's bravery cost him his life.|$|E
50|$|The {{operations}} {{varied in}} size from 4 man special forces reconnaissance <b>patrols</b> to infantry <b>fighting</b> <b>patrols</b> in company strength, sometimes coordinated in a battalion operation. They included at least one 'permanent' Claret task, an artillery position (gun and observation post) astride the border ridge with authority to fire at any identifiable Indonesian forces inside Indonesia. Infantry tasks included <b>fighting</b> <b>patrols</b> inside Indonesia looking for opportunity 'contacts', attacks on Indonesian positions and ambushing tracks and rivers.|$|R

25|$|The London Irish quickly reached {{high ground}} {{on the far side}} of the Salso, and at night ‘E’ and ‘F’ Companies got to the Simeto. As dusk approached, two platoons of ‘G’ Company moved across the river with reserve ammunition, mortars, and machine-guns for the {{immediate}} support of the two other companies. By darkness the bridgehead was secure and the Germans withdrew during the night so that in the morning a <b>fighting</b> <b>patrol</b> from the London Irish located the Germans half-way up the hills on top of which was the next objective, the much-bombed town of Aderno. That, however, was not an Irish Brigade task, for the two other brigades (11th and 36th) of the 78th Division went through. From the afternoon of August 1 to nightfall on August 5 the Irish Brigade had advanced twenty-five miles fighting battles at Centuripe, Salso, and the Simeto.|$|E
25|$|On {{the front}} of Reserve Jäger Battalion 9 (RJB 9) the 1st and 4th {{companies}} advanced to encounter determined resistance from the British infantry in the front trench, which was quickly overcome. The fight for the British reserve trench was much harder, particularly in sections where the German bombardment has been least effective. Some British troops erected barricades {{in parts of the}} trench and then fought until all were killed. Liaison between German units was difficult and later a <b>fighting</b> <b>patrol</b> was sent to gain touch with Footguard Regiment 5 (FR 5). On the right flank, RIR 86 had advanced so far that the 4th Company RJB 9 had to attack again to come into line and bogged down in the British reserve positions. Small British counter-attacks were repulsed during the night but the main effort went into consolidating the new positions and linking them to the old front line.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, the 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment, {{was sent}} to Singapore for jungle {{training}} {{in response to the}} threat of invasion from Indonesian President Sukarno. By March, the battalion was established along the Malaysia-Indonesia border in Borneo and conducting 10-day patrols in the jungle. On 27 April, 'B' Company's base on the hilltop village of Plamam Mapu, consisting of company headquarters, a mortar section, and one weak platoon of young soldiers, was attacked by 150 Indonesians supported by rocket launchers, mortars, rifle grenades, and machine guns from the surrounding hills. The accurate fire caused several casualties amongst the defenders. The Company Sergeant Major (CSM), John Williams, was in command of the defence. He kept moving around the base, attending to the wounded, reorganising the defenders to counter each attack, and firing illumination rounds from a 2-inch mortar. The Indonesians penetrated the wire, taking out a mortar position. CSM Williams crossed the open ground under fire to man a machine gun, which he used to engage the Indonesians inside the perimeter. Covered by the machine gun, the Paras counter-attacked and forced the Indonesians back. The Indonesians had located CSM Williams' machine gun, and in a second attack, it was subjected to heavy fire at point-blank range. Wounded and blinded in one eye, CSM Williams returned fire, defeating the second attack. He then led a <b>fighting</b> <b>patrol</b> to attack two groups of Indonesians seen approaching the base.|$|E
5000|$|Three <b>fighting</b> <b>patrols,</b> each of 18 men in six jeeps, and one Tactical HQ patrol of four jeeps {{were formed}} and given great autonomy. Each jeep was armed with [...]50in and [...]30in machine guns, giving the patrols immense {{firepower}} for their size. The men trained hard for amphibious, mountain and parachute operations, demolition and counter-demolition, reconnaissance and intelligence gathering.|$|R
50|$|The {{battalion}} {{formed a}} number of strong points in their half of the village, carried out <b>fighting</b> <b>patrols</b> and fought off four German counterattacks. One attack on 'A' Company, was only defeated when they called down artillery fire on their own positions. In {{the closeness of the}} fighting, the paratroopers used their fighting knives to avoid giving away their locations and casualties could not be evacuated or supplies brought forward.|$|R
2500|$|... {{the thick}} jungle, {{employing}} <b>fighting</b> <b>patrols,</b> long and short-term ambush operations, following tracks when located, and gaining limited kills in fleeting contacts. It {{was the type}} of warfare that did not yield many kills for any of the units operating in Malaya but the intensive patrolling maintained constant pressure on the enemy and, together with the granting of Malayan Independence in August 1957, led to many CT surrenders and the eventual end of the ‘Emergency’.|$|R
500|$|The {{battalion}} {{was next}} involved in serious fighting during the Battle of Messines. Although in {{a supporting role}} for the brigade's initial advance on 7 June, its companies were soon committed to reinforce the leading battalions. They continued to fight the Germans until 10 June when they were withdrawn so that the battalion could be re-organised as a whole. Later {{the same day the}} battalion was recommitted to the front line. The following morning, with characteristic aggression, Leane pushed a strong <b>fighting</b> <b>patrol</b> forward at dawn, working on his assumption that the trenches and strong points opposite the battalion were only being held at night, with the German garrison being withdrawn during the day. He proved to be right, and the German positions were captured without a fight, along with two field guns and a large quantity of ammunition. This action secured the brigade objective and linked up the 12th Brigade with the 13th Brigade on its left. Up until the battalion was withdrawn from the battle on 12 June, it had lost 4 officers and 62 men. Leane was recommended for a bar to his DSO after Messines for [...] "clever handling" [...] of his battalion, but he did not receive that award. The battalion rotated through rest, reserve positions and the front line until the Battle of Polygon Wood in September. During this battle it was in a support role, engaged mainly in salvage in rear areas, but nevertheless suffered 27 casualties from heavy shell fire. Soon after, Leane was recommended to be made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG). The recommendation read: ...|$|E

50|$|After their {{selection}} and induction these recruits underwent further training in bush warfare and conventional pathfinding methods {{as a part}} of 2 pathfinder selection courses. This training by early 1981 produced sufficient personnel to be deployed on active service. Their envisaged role was to conduct mobile, <b>fighting</b> <b>patrols</b> deep inside Angola. They were highly trained in counter-terrorist operations and already self-sufficient and in most cases independent {{from the rest of the}} SADF.|$|R
50|$|The airport {{base was}} being {{constantly}} hit by mortar and rocket fire during the siege, being struck {{dozens of times}} per day. Despite the weight of fire, there was relatively little disruption to operations, as considerable effort had been put into Force Protection measures. These included passive measures on the base, such as physical hardening of structures, and active measures, such as <b>fighting</b> <b>patrols</b> conducted by RAF Regiment squadrons in the Base's ground defence area, beyond the perimeter.|$|R
50|$|The {{summer of}} 1943 {{was spent in}} Algeria and Tunisia {{recruiting}} and training new volunteers from the LRDG, SAS, Commandos and Royal Armoured Corps for the fight in Italy, bringing the unit's size up to about 35 all ranks, with two <b>fighting</b> <b>patrols</b> and a small HQ.
