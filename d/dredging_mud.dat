40|$|Dredging {{and land}} {{reclamation}} is a billion dollar {{industry that is}} spread around the coastal regions of Australia. Maintenance dredging is carried out regularly in many major Australian ports and in several cases the <b>dredged</b> <b>mud</b> is pumped ashore into containment paddocks at high water contents. When the <b>dredged</b> <b>mud</b> settles, there can be segregation with possible anisotropy. The sedimentation of the <b>dredged</b> <b>mud</b> is followed by self-weight consolidation which can take a long time. To accelerate the consolidation process, prefabricated vertical drains and surcharge are often used. To analyse the consolidation process of the <b>dredged</b> <b>mud</b> with vertical drains {{it is necessary to}} have a proper understanding of the anisotropic characteristics of the <b>dredged</b> <b>mud.</b> The objective {{of this paper is to}} summarise the results of laboratory consolidation studies carried out on reconstituted <b>dredged</b> <b>mud</b> specimens that were sedimented from slurry at high water contents in the order of 270 %. The horizontal and vertical coefficients of consolidation were determined on separate oedometer tests with appropriate drainage boundaries.

40|$|Electrokinetic {{stabilisation}} is {{a method}} of improving the geotechnical parameters and behaviour of a soft soil by the application of electric current between electrodes. This improvement {{is due to the}} physiochemical changes generated in the soil; however not all the changes are desirable. For instance, the reduction in pH near the anode can increase its corrosion rate. Therefore, it is important to study the physiochemical changes in the soil during electrokinetic stabilisation in order to estimate the behaviour of the soil in response to treatment. This study investigates the suitability of electrokinetic stabilisation for improving the geotechnical parameters and behaviour of <b>dredged</b> <b>mud</b> and demonstrates how the physiochemical nature of the soil changes during the process. For this purpose, two types of electrodes were used to transfer electric current through the soil and the changes in physiochemical nature of the <b>dredged</b> <b>mud</b> were investigated during and after the treatment. This entire process was conducted under closed conditions; that is, no water was allowed to flow through soil during stabilisation. Consequently, the water content of the soil was significantly reduced near the anode and this {{can be attributed to the}} changes of pH and physiochemical properties of the soil. It is concluded that this method is very well suited to dewater and consolidate <b>dredged</b> <b>mud</b> slurries...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{laboratory}} tests {{was performed to}} evaluate the effect of clay fabric, altered due to the addition of hydrated lime into slurry, on the primary and secondary consolidation behavior of <b>dredged</b> <b>mud</b> samples. In this research, the seepage-induced consolidation test is proposed as a technique to determine the threshold value of lime, below which maximum flocculation of the clay particles takes place. A series of oedometer tests was conducted on lime treated samples in both normally consolidated (NC) and artificially over- consolidated (OC) states. The results obtained in NC range showed that both the coefficient of consolidation and compression index increased as the lime content increased. Under the same value of effective stress, with varying the amount of lime, the compression index increased and secondary compression index reduced, resulting in a gradual reduction of Calpha/Cc value. The laboratory results show that in the OC state and with surcharging, both the secondary compression index and recompression index reduced when the percentage of lime increased. However, {{it was observed that}} the surcharging effort has less impact on secondary compression as the percentage of lime increased. This study may encourage an innovative ground improvement technique, in which <b>dredged</b> <b>mud</b> slurry can be mixed with lime prior to discharging into a containment pond in order to optimize the effectiveness of preloading on the <b>dredged</b> <b>mud</b> layer...|$|R

40|$|Mining and {{dredging}} are {{two major}} economic activities in Australia, and millions of tonnes of waste materials are produced every year by these activities. Mine tailings derived from crushed waste rock, and <b>dredged</b> <b>mud</b> removed from waterways during maintenance dredging, require effective means of disposal. While mine tailings are generally utilized as backfilling material to fill the underground voids created during mining operations, <b>dredged</b> <b>mud</b> is commonly used in land reclamation. In underground mining, accidents have resulted in severe economic damage and loss of lives, while in land reclamation, because of the very slow sedimentation and consolidation processes, future infrastructure development can be delayed. This paper summarizes an extensive literature review {{on the use of}} geopolymers and pozzolanic materials in stabilizing geomaterials. Generally, additives are used to enhance the engineering behaviour of soils and concrete. Cement {{is one of the most}} popular additives used to improve the properties of soils. Lately, there have been attempts to use pozzolanic materials such as fly ash and slag to partially replace cement. Excessive cement usage in soil may be reduced by using supplementary cementitious materials such as fly ash and slag, blended cement and geopolymers in some geotechnical applications, which should lead to environment sustainability and substantial cost savings...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the past}} few decades, {{increased}} population and infrastructure development have necessitated planning the development activities on soft soil deposits. In addition to treating the existing soft soils, new land areas are formed in the sea in order to expand the adjacent facilities such as Airports and Ports. Land reclamation projects are increasingly carried out in a sustainable way by reusing the maintenance <b>dredged</b> <b>mud</b> as filling materials. There are number of large scale land reclamation projects, where maintenance <b>dredged</b> <b>mud</b> is utilised to fill the reclamation site, such as Port of Brisbane expansion project, offshore expansion project at Tokyo international Airport and Kansai international airport development project, to name few. Soft soils show poor load bearing capacity and undergo large settlement under a load application, thus they should be consolidated prior to the commencement of construction activities. The soft layers are preloaded in conjunction with prefabricated vertical drains (PVD) {{to speed up the}} consolidation process. In the case of land reclamation works, the <b>dredged</b> <b>mud</b> slurry is first allowed to undergo sedimentation before it is consolidated. Reliable analysis of time dependent consolidation process and settlement of the soil layer is important to plan ahead the construction activities. Accurate consolidation analysis requires appropriate theories, tools and understanding of the subsoil conditions. Several consolidation theories have been developed to model the consolidation mechanism of soils mathematically, which are solved with boundary conditions relevant to the practical problem to produce mathematical solutions. In the absence of simplistic mathematical solutions, empirical equations and approximations are used to predict the time dependent consolidation and settlement of soil layer. This dissertation focuses on enhancing the consolidation analysis of soft soil layers by the critical review of existing solutions available for the consolidation analysis of single and multi-layers. The standard mathematical solutions available for the radial consolidation of soil layer were developed considering a uniform initial excess pore water pressure distribution in the soil layer. The potential non-uniform excess pore water pressure distributions that can practically occur were not incorporated in the solutions. Within this dissertation, the effect of different non-uniform pore water pressure distributions on the radial consolidation behaviour of a soil layer, where the pore water flow is radially outwards towards a peripheral drain, is analysed through a mathematical study. Graphical solutions are developed for the average degree of consolidation and pore water pressure and degree of consolidation isochrones are plotted. To analyse the time dependent consolidation behaviour of multi-layered soil, empirical equations and approximations have been developed to overcome the difficulties associated with the complex mathematical solutions. These approximations do not have any sound theoretical basis and thus have limitation in their application. Another objective of the dissertation is to investigate the applicability of selected approximation in the consolidation analysis of double layer soil considering different properties, thicknesses and drainage conditions. For this, an error analysis is conducted utilising the advanced soft soil creep model in PLAXIS. One-dimensional consolidation of a double layer system is experimentally modelled in the laboratory. The consolidation tests are simulated in PLAXIS to validate the soft soil creep model. Further, expressions are proposed for the equivalent stiffness parameters of a composite double layer system, which was verified using the results obtained from the experiments and PLAXIS modelling. Sedimentation of soft soil is common in the land reclamations works carried out using <b>dredged</b> <b>mud</b> as filling materials. The initial conditions of the soft soil slurry, such as the water content and salt concentration, influence the settling pattern of particles during the sedimentation. This dissertation presents the extensive laboratory studies conducted to investigate the effect of settling patterns of particles in the final properties of the <b>dredged</b> <b>mud</b> sediment. In the experiments, <b>dredged</b> <b>mud</b> is mixed with sea water and freshwater at different water contents to induce various settling pattern of particles reflecting the sedimentation environment. Series of oedometer tests are conducted for the radial consolidation and vertical consolidation and the compressibility and permeability properties are assessed. From the results the depth variation of the sediment properties and anisotropy between the horizontal and vertical properties are evaluated for the different settling patterns. Further, the dissertation presents a new estimation method to calculate the horizontal coefficient of consolidation from the radial consolidation tests conducted using a peripheral drain. The proposed method was validated using series of radial consolidation tests, which is described in this dissertation...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{scarcity}} of land following rapid development in many countries, the <b>dredged</b> <b>mud</b> {{may be used as}} fill materials to develop new land in coastal zones. Several major infrastructure facilities like ports or airports are strategically situated on these artificial lands. However, soft dredged deposits are intrinsically low in strength, and very high in compressibility. As a result of these inherently undesirable engineering characteristics, an appropriate ground improvement technique has to be employed so as to meet the engineering requirements necessary for the design and construction of overhead infrastructure facilities. The placement of a surcharge preload on a soft foundation facilitated with vertical drains is the most commonplace method used worldwide. Surcharge preloading with vertical drains is used to accelerate the rate of primary consolidation settlement and reduce the magnitude of the post construction secondary compression settlement. In this study, an attempt was made to provide insight into some factors, aimed at improving the efficiency of the preloading used in a man-made island. A series of laboratory tests was performed to evaluate the effect of clay fabric, altered due to the addition of hydrated lime into slurry, on the primary and secondary consolidation behaviour of the <b>dredged</b> <b>mud</b> samples. As a prime objective, a unique testing method was proposed to determine the threshold value of lime below which the maximum alteration in clay fabric takes place. This threshold is known as Lime Modification Optimum and presents the boundary between modification (i. e. ion exchange and flocculation) and solidification (i. e. formation of the pozzolanic products) phases in limeclay reaction. It was found that, for the type of the <b>dredged</b> <b>mud</b> used in this study, 4 percent of lime (dry weight basis) should be considered as lime modification optimum. A set of oedometer tests was conducted in both normally consolidated (NC) and artificially overconsolidated (OC) stages on both natural and lime treated samples. The laboratory findings revealed that with an increase of lime up to 4 percent, the increase of coefficient of consolidation, cᵥ, was observed up to ten fold,. Observation of the test results suggested that in the compression range, the values of the compression index, (Cc), increase when increasing the lime content whereas in the recompression range, the value of the recompression index, (Cr), gradually decreases with increasing...|$|R
