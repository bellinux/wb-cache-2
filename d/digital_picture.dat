25|$|The {{solution}} was {{offered by the}} CDS. With {{the addition of the}} new <b>Digital</b> <b>Picture</b> Transmission system (DPT), a single ship carrying Type 984 and CDS could pass off information to any ship with an output display and the DPT radio equipment. This allowed destroyers to get their initial cueing from the 984 while being positioned some distance away, which was important given the fairly short range of Seaslug. When the cruiser design was canceled, this need became more pressing. Pye Ltd. was given the production contract.|$|E

25|$|The {{first stage}} of the process is the {{scanning}} of the film negatives or prints into a <b>digital</b> <b>picture</b> and sound raw format. Depending on the film's condition, it may undergo a physical cleaning before the scanning could begin. The scanned materials will then undergo an automated and a painstaking frame by frame digital restoration process. The process involves the digital removal of dirt, scratches, fingerprints, discolorations, molds, tape marks, and other damages in the scanned materials. The process also involves the correction of color, brightness, and contrast into its original form often consulting the original cinematographers of each films whenever possible. Subtitles and watermarks, if present, are also remove in the process. The process also involves the restoration and remastering of sound. This involves the syncing of sound to the picture {{and the removal of}} unnecessary noises such as eradicate pops and whistles. Extreme measures were also done to remove copyrighted songs from some films. Dozens of technicians, engineers, and artists work hundreds of hours for each film with restoration cost ranging anywhere between twenty-five thousand pesos and ten million pesos per film.|$|E
2500|$|Since 2006, RFID tags {{included}} in new United States passports will store {{the same information}} that is printed within the passport, and include a <b>digital</b> <b>picture</b> of the owner. The United States Department of State initially stated the chips could only be read {{from a distance of}} , but after widespread criticism and a clear demonstration that special equipment can read the test passports from [...] away, the passports were designed to incorporate a thin metal lining to {{make it more difficult for}} unauthorized readers to [...] "skim" [...] information when the passport is closed. The department will also implement Basic Access Control (BAC), which functions as a personal identification number (PIN) in the form of characters printed on the passport data page. Before a passport's tag can be read, this PIN must be entered into an RFID reader. The BAC also enables the encryption of any communication between the chip and interrogator. As noted in the section below on security, there are many situations in which these protections have been shown to be insufficient, and passports have been cloned based on scans of them while they were being delivered in the mail.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} method for {{computing}} the Z 2 –cohomology ring of a simplicial complex uniquely associated with a three–dimensional <b>digital</b> binary–valued <b>picture</b> I. Binary <b>digital</b> <b>pictures</b> are represented on the standard grid Z 3, in which all grid points have integer coordinates. Considering a particular 14 –neighbourhood system on this grid, we construct a unique simplicial complex K(I) topologically representing (up to isomorphisms of pictures) the picture I. We then compute the cohomology ring on I via the simplicial complex K(I). The usefulness of a simplicial description of the digital Z 2 –cohomology ring of binary <b>digital</b> <b>pictures</b> is tested {{by means of a}} small program visualizing the different steps of our method. Some examples concerning topological thinning, the visualization of representative generators of cohomology classes and the computation of the cup product on the cohomology of simple 3 D <b>digital</b> <b>pictures</b> are showed...|$|R
