5000|$|Whereas {{alcohol is}} {{intrinsically}} a denaturing and <b>inert</b> <b>rendering</b> agent {{to many of}} a botanicals extracted constituent and compounds, glycerin possesses no such denaturing and <b>inert</b> <b>rendering</b> effects on a botanicals extracted constituents and compounds. From both clinical and manufacturing perspectives, this is possibly the most important defining differentiator between alcohol-based made tinctures versus true alcohol-free glycerin-based made Glycerites, that includes: actual levels or degrees of efficacy relative to actual concentrations (i.e. percentages) of constituents and/or constituent group(s) present in a finished tincture and/or Glycerite, now given what has previously been unaddressed concerning the denaturing/inert-rendering weighted factor for alcohol-based tinctures (a Clinical consideration); and the QA/QC related physical properties inherent in and chemically intrinsic to a finished tincture and/or Glycerite as regards inverting, REDOX, precipitation, scaling, novel constituent complexing, etc. (a Manufacturing consideration).|$|E
5000|$|However, when {{glycerin}} is {{utilized in}} a dynamic contemporary non-tincturing based innovative processing methodology {{it has been}} shown to not only extract a wide range of compounds, it is widely accepted, both in literature and innovative applications, to extract many constituents and compounds previously thought not able to do and to extract those constituents and compounds at high concentrations and potency. This includes most alkaloids, glycosides, volatile oils, waxes, resins, gums, balsam, sugars (especially as non-denatured linked and cross-linked polysaccharides), vitamins, and minerals, all with none of the denaturing and <b>inert</b> <b>rendering</b> effects alcohol possesses.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike alcohol, {{with its}} di-atomic state, that has quick {{access to the}} liver, {{glycerine}} is approximately 30% slower absorbed by the digestive tract and is utilized through a secondary pathway in the liver (known as the gluconeogenic pathway) resulting in a lower glycemic load on the body than happens with alcohol. [...] Fluid extract manufacturers often extract herbs in alcohol and then remove the alcohol (called alcohol-removed) or hot water before adding glycerin to make glycerites to increase extraction potential. However, {{there are those who}} consider it counter-productive to extract with alcohol, then remove alcohol, then add glycerin to increase extraction potential, as the intrinsic denaturing and <b>inert</b> <b>rendering</b> effects of alcohol on the alcohol extracted mixture cannot be reversed, leaving post-alcohol glycerin extracts to extract already alcohol denatured and inert rendered components. From a clinical as well as nutritional perspective, an extracts components containing denatured and inert rendered compounds is not desired.|$|E

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for:- (1) equipment for separating granular material into various grain fractions; (2) plastics aggregate for lightweight concrete {{in the form of}} granular waste <b>rendered</b> <b>inert</b> by chemical treatment with strong caustic alkali and/or strong acid. USE - The separating equipment is used for separating round and angular grains, especially the plastics aggregate (all claimed). The lightweight concrete is useful e. g. in overground, underground, agricultural and horticultural construction and road building. ADVANTAGE - Recycling plastics scrap saves mineral oil resources and reduces carbon dioxide and associated toxic emissions by avoiding incineration. However, impurities in the scrap can make concrete swell on exposure to humidity and reduce the strength. Chemical treatment eliminates this problem. The lightweight concrete has good processing properties and pumpability and no or little swelling and gives durable lightweight structures of satisfactory strength...|$|R

In this study, nanoporous gold films(NPGF) and multiwall carbon nanotubes were coated with ALD alumina of varying thicknesses. Subsequently, the plasmonic property of the former and electronic property of the latter was monitored by Transmittance and Raman Spectroscopy respectively. Transmittance spectra revealed that NPGF passivated by ALD-alumina maintains its plasmonic properties, i. e. its LSPR supporting properties remained intact. Raman spectra of ALD alumina passivated MWNTs show no coating induced changes in its characteristic Raman features. This led to the conclusion that ALD alumina is a benign and suitable technique for thin film passivation of NPGF and MWNTs. This result supports the expansion of ALD’s domain as a reliable thin film passivation technique in areas of SERS based biosensor research and the passivation of carbon nanotubes...|$|R

30|$|For the {{continuous}} catalytic HDO of CVO, H 2 and CVO were fed continuously into the process.

The reactor was mounted, <b>rendered</b> <b>inert</b> and finally CVO was provided in the reactor to give a filling level of two-thirds at the reaction temperature relative to the overall reactor volume. H 2 acts as a stripping and hydrogenation gas. The H 2 flow was set to 2.5  g/h by means of a mass flow counter (type M 12202139 A, Bronkhorst High-Tech B.V., Ruurlo, Netherlands). Comparable investigations used a similar flow for H 2 [13, 30]. The liquid feed rate was 3.5  g/h and was chosen according to the preliminary investigations in semi-continuous mode [7]. Condensate samples were released continuously every 30  min at the beginning and then every 60  min after approximately 3  h time on stream (condensate fraction). The sump fraction was collected in the reactor. The catalytic HDO of CVO was run continuously investigating time on stream between 7 and 12  h. The preparation of all continuous catalytic HDO experiments was identical to assure reproducibility.|$|R
40|$|Protein biochips are {{miniaturized}} biological sensors {{intended to}} analyze and characterize biomolecule interactions with high throughput. An important issue when developing such biochips is substrate passivation. The support is <b>rendered</b> <b>inert</b> {{in order to avoid}} non-specific adsorption. Strategic control of the non-specific protein adsorption can be achieved by creating a resistant self-assembled monolayer (SAM) based on polyethylene glycol (PEG). The degree of resistance depends on the PEG surface density, i. e. the number of PEG units the molecule contains. Infrared-visible sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy (Lambert et al., Appl Spectrosc Rev 40 : 103 – 145, 2005) is used to in-vestigate the vibrational fingerprint of a PEG self-assembled monolayer adsorbed on a flat platinum surface, in the 2, 750 – 3, 050 [*]cm− 1 frequency range. The objec-tive is to characterize the SFG baseline of the biosensor that will be further developed by mixing the PEG antifouling layer with bioactive host molecules. Nanostructures will then be implemented on the substrate in order to enhance the SFG signal through localized surface plasmon resonances (Lis et al., Adv Opt Mater 1 : 244 – 255, 2013).
