5|$|During {{its first}} four years, Lassie {{received}} very decent ratings. However, {{at the end}} of the 1958–1959 season, the ratings had fallen out of the top 30 due to the constant turnover <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cast.</b> Once viewers began to warm to Lockhart and Reilly as Timmy's parents, the Martin family was accepted and embraced by the public. As a result, between 1960 and 1964, Lassies ratings greatly improved and by the spring of 1964, it received its highest rating ever, ranking at #13.|$|E

5|$|Barker began {{acting in}} {{repertory}} theatre and {{decided he was}} best suited to comic roles. He had his first success at the Oxford Playhouse and in roles in the West End including Tom Stoppard's The Real Inspector Hound. During this period, he was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cast</b> of BBC radio and television comedies such as The Navy Lark. He got his television break with the satirical sketch series The Frost Report in 1966, where he met future collaborator, Ronnie Corbett.

Roshan Basheer was selected to reprise the role of Varun, the son of the Inspector General of Police, in the remake. He did not feel that he was being typecast and he accepted the role, adding that it is not often that a Malayalam actor gets a chance to act in the Telugu films.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} since its release, modern film {{scholars}} {{have noted the}} possible homosexual reading of the film. Director James Whale was openly gay, {{and some of the}} actors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cast,</b> including Ernest Thesiger and Colin Clive, were believed to be gay or bisexual. Although James Curtis, Whale's biographer, rejects the notion that Whale would have identified with the Monster from a homosexual perspective, scholars have perceived a gay subtext suffused through the film, especially a camp sensibility, particularly embodied in the character of Pretorius and his relationship with Henry.|$|E

5|$|Robert Blackman {{joined the}} crew {{prior to the}} start of the season as costume designer. He had been {{recommended}} by his predecessor, Durinda Rice Wood. He later recalled that he wasn't interested in the job and only took the interview as a favor, but he was so struck by producer David Livingston's enthusiasm that he accepted the post. One of his tasks was to redesign the Starfleet costumes which had been used for the first two seasons. The previous versions were made of spandex and caused back problems <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cast.</b> The new costumes cost $3,000, and were made out of a wool gabardine.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{differ on}} whether Dodd had {{a part in}} Evil Angels (released as A Cry in the Dark outside of Australia and New Zealand), the 1988 film about the Azaria Chamberlain disappearance, with Dodd's name not {{included}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cast</b> list published by Australian Film 1978–1994, but appearing in the longer cast listing provided by IMDb. In 1988 he played a minor role in Kadaicha, an unreleased horror film about a series of unexplained murders. In 1990 Dodd appeared in two films: Quigley Down Under, a western made in Australia but starring American Tom Selleck and Briton Alan Rickman; and The Crossing, an Australian drama set in a country town.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} effects of {{additive}} concentration <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> solution on performance of asymmetric PES ultrafiltration flat sheet membranes. The membranes were prepared by phase inversion process from <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> solution containing polyethersulfone (PES) as polymer, N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as solvent and polyethylene glycol (PEG) of various molecular weights. The concentration of additives were varied from 5 to 25 wt% <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> solutions. <b>The</b> membranes were characterized <b>in</b> terms of <b>the</b> pure water permeation, solute separation and flux. The results indicated that increased concentration of PEG 400 and PEG 600 in casting solution increased pure water permeation. It is observed that when higher concentration of PEG 200 was added <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> solution, pure water permeation decreased significantly. As concentration of PEG 400 and PEG 600 in casting solution is increased, solute separation gradually decreases and flux increased. However, when PEG 200 concentration is increased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> solution, <b>the</b> solute separation increased significantly while flux decreased. The morphology of the membranes changed with different concentration of additive added. Experimental results revealed that different molecular weights and concentration of additives greatly influenced the performance of PES ultrafiltration flat sheet membranes...|$|R

5|$|Following {{the eighth}} season of The X-Files, David Duchovny {{announced}} that he would be completely leaving the show. As such, the future of the show was up in the air. Before greenlighting a ninth season, neither the Fox Network nor any of the Ten Thirteen Productions members knew if creator Chris Carter would return for another season. With this being said, he encouraged {{the other members of the}} crew to continue the series without him. Eventually, however, several crew members began to develop new scripts ideas for the ninth season, many of which excited Carter. This new-found enthusiasm eventually caused Carter to sign a contract with Fox for another year. Likewise, Anderson signed on at the last minute, with her contract extension only lasting until the end of 2002; she specifically stated that she would leave the show following the conclusion of the season. Due to the changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cast,</b> during the ninth season Doggett and Reyes became the series' new leads. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz speculated that the show could extend into a tenth and possibly eleventh season, if the show was able to attract an audience. However, the show lost viewers and was eventually cancelled by Fox.|$|E
5|$|Grimaldi and Dubois {{appeared}} {{together again}} later that spring at Sadler's Wells in Dibdin's Harlequin Alchemist, which {{set up a}} mock duel between the two Clowns, with the audience deciding who could pull the most hideous face. Grimaldi consistently won. In the next piece, Harlequin Benedick; or, The Ghost of Mother Shipton. Dubois was relegated {{to the role of}} Pierrot, while Grimaldi played Clown. Grimaldi's mother was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cast,</b> appearing as the Butcher's Wife. He then appeared in another Dibdin play, The Great Devil. During the run, he accidentally injured himself on stage by shooting himself in the foot and was confined to bed for five weeks. His mother became so concerned at her son's fragile and still grief-stricken state that she employed a dancer at Drury Lane, Mary Bristow, to care for him full-time during those weeks. They formed a close friendship, which resulted in a loving relationship, and they married on 24 December 1801.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, Makeba {{sang the}} lead female {{role in the}} Broadway-inspired South African jazz opera King Kong; among those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cast</b> was the {{musician}} Hugh Masekela. The musical was performed to racially integrated audiences, raising her profile among white South Africans. Also in 1959, she had a short guest appearance in Come Back, Africa, an anti-apartheid film produced and directed by the American independent filmmaker Lionel Rogosin. Rogosin cast her after seeing her on stage in African Jazz and Variety show, on which Makeba was a performer for 18 months. The film blended elements of documentary and fiction {{and had to be}} filmed in secret as the government was expected to be hostile to it. Makeba appeared on stage, and sang two songs: her appearance lasted four minutes. The cameo made an enormous impression on viewers, and Rogosin organised a visa for her to attend the premiere of the film at the twenty-fourth Venice Film Festival in Italy, where the film won the prestigious Critics' Choice Award. Makeba's presence has been described as crucial to the film, as an emblem of cosmopolitan black identity that also connected with working-class black people due to the dialogue being in Zulu.|$|E

5|$|Sellers {{released}} his first studio album in 1958 called The Best of Sellers; {{a collection of}} sketches and comic songs, which were undertaken {{in a variety of}} comic characters. Produced by George Martin and released on Parlophone, the album reached number three in the UK Albums Chart; The same year, Sellers made his first film with John and Roy Boulting in Carlton-Browne of the F.O., a comedy in which he played a supporting role for the film's lead, Terry-Thomas. Before the release of that film, the Boultings, along with Sellers and Thomas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cast,</b> started filming I'm All Right Jack, which became the highest grossing film at the British box office in 1960.
