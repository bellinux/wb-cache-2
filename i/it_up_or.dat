25|$|In the newt species Notophthalmus viridescens, {{the males}} rub off {{hormonal}} secretions onto {{the skin of}} the females they are courting. These hormones have been shown to make the female more receptive to mating with the male. When the male deposits the secretions, he detaches from the female and releases a spermatophore (containing spermatozoa). It is then the female’s decision to either accept it and pick <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>or</b> reject it by running away; these hormones make her more likely to accept it.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} count, a pin must be knocked over entirely. If the pin is {{wobbling}} as the automatic pin machine picks <b>it</b> <b>up</b> (<b>or</b> the machine itself knocks over the pin {{while it is}} wobbling), it is still considered standing and is not scored. Also, if a pin is moved, it does not change its designation. For example, if the 10 pin were still standing and the 7 pin slid into the 8 pin position, converting this spare would still be considered and given a 7–10 split award (if performed in certified play).|$|E

It's not an easy thing to do. I was obsessed with the whole project, that's all I was trying to do, see if I could do this. Once I got into it, I didn't think about {{anything}} but finishing it. I stuck to those two because I thought it would be more challenging and more fun and more of a statement to what you could do with sample alone. It is an art form. It is music. You can do different things, it doesn't have to be just what some people call stealing. It can be a lot more than that.|$|E

25|$|The caisson lock can however be powered, and the caisson lifted, by {{buoyancy}} alone. Pumping {{ballast water}} {{in and out}} of the caisson is enough to float <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>or</b> down the lock chamber. The weight of ballast water is approximately that of the canal barge being lifted. The boat lift though needs a mechanical lift system. In most vertical lift systems, this must also lift or lower the weight of the caisson and its water contents as well. This is substantially more than the barge alone, and the power to lift it is supplied mechanically. At the time of their development, the steam engine was in its infancy. Steam engines had been developed as water pumps, but not yet for the supply of mechanical power (see rotative steam engine). Given the engineering constraints of the time, lifting an enclosed caisson by buoyancy was more practical than driving a boat lift.|$|E
25|$|With the {{addition}} of the server browser and custom server options in the February 2017, many of the Control maps can also be set to be played in casual game modes as Capture the Flag. Both teams have a flag they must defend from the opposing team. To pick up the opponent's flag, the player must keep their character close to the flag and not take damage for a few moments. Once they have the flag, they must race back to their home base to earn the capture point. If the character is killed, the flag is dropped and either the capturing team must follow similar rules to pick <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> <b>or</b> if the owning team stays near the flag, it is automatically returned. A team can capture the opposing flag even if their flag has been taken. The match is over after one team obtains 3 captures or 5 minutes has expired, whichever comes first.|$|E

500|$|Burton {{argued that}} both {{constitutional}} provisions were violated because the crime {{had not occurred}} in the Eastern District of Missouri. Justice Peckham, writing for the entire Court except for Justice Harlan in dissent, reversed Burton's convictions on these grounds. The Court held that Burton's negotiation of the check in Washington, D.C. did not constitute conduct by Burton in St. Louis (the site of the drawee bank). In other words, whatever the Washington, D.C. bank did with the check afterwards, it did for itself, not as Burton's agent. [...] "From {{the time of the}} delivery of the check by the defendant to the bank it became the owner of the check; it could have torn <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>or</b> thrown it in the fire or made any other use or disposition of it which it chose, and no right of defendant would have been infringed." [...] Thus, the Court held that it was error for the trial judge to have submitted the question of the [...] "understanding [...] [...] [...] between the defendant and the bank" [...] to the jury. In support of this argument, the Court cited several of its own precedents concerning negotiable instrument law, as well as cases from the House of Lords and the courts of New York and Massachusetts.|$|E
500|$|Campbell {{attended}} the Alfred E. Smith Career and Technical Education High School in the Bronx, where his height, frame, and demeanor {{on the basketball}} court prompted the other kids to nickname him [...] "Hercules". He began running with a graffiti crew called the Ex-Vandals, taking the name Kool Herc. Herc recalls persuading his father to buy him a copy of [...] "Sex Machine" [...] by James Brown, a record that not a lot of his friends had, and which they would come to him to hear. He and his sister, Cindy, began hosting back-to-school parties in the recreation room of their building, 1520 Sedgwick Avenue. Herc's first soundsystem consisted of two turntables connected to two amplifiers and a Shure [...] "Vocal Master" [...] PA system with 2 speakers columns, on which he played records such as James Brown's [...] "Give <b>It</b> <b>Up</b> <b>or</b> Turnit a Loose", Jimmy Castor's [...] "It's Just Begun" [...] and Booker T. & the M.G.'s' [...] "Melting Pot". With Bronx clubs struggling with street gangs, uptown DJs catering to an older disco crowd with different aspirations, and commercial radio also catering to a demographic distinct from teenagers in the Bronx, Herc's parties had a ready-made audience.|$|E

His main inspiration for Chris' voice came from envisioning how [...] "Buffalo Bill" [...] would sound if he were speaking through a public address system at a McDonald's. Lacey Chabert was cast as Meg Griffin. Chabert voiced Meg Griffin for the first production season (15 episodes), but due to a contractual agreement was never credited. Chabert left the series because of time conflicts with schoolwork and her role on Party of Five, and was replaced by Mila Kunis.|$|E

500|$|DJ Kool Herc {{developed}} the style {{that was the}} blueprint for hip hop music. Herc used the record {{to focus on a}} short, heavily percussive part in it: the [...] "break". Since this part of the record was the one the dancers liked best, Herc isolated the break and prolonged it by changing between two record players. As one record {{reached the end of the}} break, he cued a second record back to the beginning of the break, which allowed him to extend a relatively short section of music into [...] "five-minute loop of fury". This innovation had its roots in what Herc called [...] "The Merry-Go-Round," [...] a technique by which the deejay switched from break to break at the height of the party. This technique is specifically called [...] "The Merry-Go-Round" [...] because according to Herc, it takes [...] one [...] "back and forth with no slack." [...] Herc told The New York Times that he first introduced the Merry-Go-Round into his sets in 1972. The earliest known Merry-Go-Round involved playing James Brown's [...] "Give <b>It</b> <b>Up</b> <b>or</b> Turnit a Loose" [...] (with its refrain, [...] "Now clap your hands! Stomp your feet!"), then switching from that record's break into the break from a second record, [...] "Bongo Rock" [...] by The Incredible Bongo Band. From the [...] "Bongo Rock"'s break, Herc used a third record to switch to the break on [...] "The Mexican" [...] by the English rock band Babe Ruth. Kool Herc also contributed to developing the rhyming style of hip hop by punctuating the recorded music with slang phrases, announcing: [...] "Rock on, my mellow!" [...] "B-boys, b-girls, are you ready? keep on rock steady" [...] "This is the joint! Herc beat on the point" [...] "To the beat, y'all!" [...] "You don't stop!" [...] For his contributions, Herc is called a [...] "founding father of hip hop," [...] a [...] "nascent cultural hero," [...] and an integral part of the beginnings of hip hop by Time.|$|E
2500|$|The {{pendulum}} {{always has}} a means of adjusting the period, usually by an adjustment nut (c) under the bob which moves <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>or</b> down on the rod. [...] Moving the bob up decreases the pendulum's length, causing the pendulum to swing faster and the clock to gain time. Some precision clocks have a small auxiliary adjustment weight on a threaded shaft on the bob, to allow finer adjustment. Some tower clocks and precision clocks use a tray attached near to {{the midpoint of the}} pendulum rod, to which small weights can be added or removed. This effectively shifts the centre of oscillation and allows the rate to be adjusted without stopping the clock.|$|E
2500|$|In his [...] "Freeport Doctrine" [...] of 1858, he {{repeatedly}} {{said that he}} did not care whether slavery was voted up or down, but only that the people had the right to vote <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>or</b> down. He denounced as sacrilegious the petitions signed by thousands of clergymen in 1854, who said the Kansas–Nebraska Act offended God's will. He rejected the Republican assertions that slavery was condemned by a [...] "higher law" [...] (Seward's position) and that the nation could not long survive as half slave and half free (Lincoln's position). He disagreed with the Supreme Court's Dred Scott decision that Congress had no ability to regulate slavery in the territories. When Buchanan supported the Lecompton Constitution and the pro-slavery position on Kansas, Douglas fought him in a long battle that gained Douglas the 1860 Democratic nomination but ripped his party apart.|$|E

2500|$|In funk bands, guitarists {{typically}} {{play in a}} percussive style, often {{using the}} wah-wah sound effect and muting the notes in their riffs to create a percussive sound. Guitarist Ernie Isley of the Isley Brothers and Eddie Hazel of Funkadelic were notably influenced by Jimi Hendrix's improvised solos. Eddie Hazel, who worked with George Clinton, {{is one of the}} most notable guitar soloists in funk. Ernie Isley was tutored at an early age by Jimi Hendrix himself, when he was a part of the Isley Brothers backing band and lived in the attic temporarily at the Isleys' household. Jimmy Nolen and Phelps Collins are famous funk rhythm guitarists who both worked with James Brown. On Brown's [...] "Give <b>It</b> <b>Up</b> <b>or</b> Turnit a Loose" [...] (1969), Jimmy Nolen's guitar part has a bare bones tonal structure. The pattern of attack-points is the emphasis, not the pattern of pitches. The guitar is used the way that an African drum, or idiophone would be used. Note that the measures alternate between beginning on the beat, and beginning on offbeats.|$|E
