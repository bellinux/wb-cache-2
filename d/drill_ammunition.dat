50|$|Dependent {{upon the}} type of projectile, {{ammunition}} for these guns is classified as high explosive, target practice, blank, or drill. The high explosive projectile contains a high explosive filler. The target practice projectile contains no explosive; it consists of either a solid projectile (designated shot) or a heavy-walled projectile with an empty base cavity. The blank ammunition has a black powder (low explosive) charge in the cartridge case and no projectile. The <b>drill</b> <b>ammunition</b> consists of completely inert cartridge which simulates the service ammunition.|$|E
50|$|Throughout {{much of the}} war, cadets {{from the}} Citadel, South Carolina's {{military}} institute, continued to aid the Confederate Army by helping to <b>drill</b> recruits, manufacture <b>ammunition,</b> protect arms depots, and guard Union prisoners.|$|R
50|$|Like Delta Force live fire marksmanship <b>drills</b> {{with live}} <b>ammunition</b> in both long range and close quarter battle drills is also done with hostage roles being played by other {{students}} {{to help build}} the candidates trust between each other.|$|R
50|$|The {{daily routine}} {{begins with a}} 20 km morning run. Infiltration, exfiltration, assault, room and {{building}} intervention, intelligence gathering, patrolling, ambush tactics, counter-ambush tactics, counter insurgency, counter-terrorism, unconventional warfare, guerilla warfare, asymmetric warfare, raids and sabotage, martial arts training, tactical shooting, stress firing, reflex shooting, buddy system drills, close quarter battle, tactical driving, advance weapon courses and handling, sniping, demolition training, survival skills, linguistic training, logistic training, trade-craft training is imparted by the intelligence agencies. The training <b>drills</b> involve live <b>ammunition</b> at all times which is a reason for fatal accidents at times leading to death.|$|R
25|$|Training and {{preparing}} for war also involves significant dangers, as do other military duties. Consequently, many military brats live {{with the reality of}} risk to one or both parents even when there is no active war. Peacetime military accidents claim lives every year at a significantly higher rate than accidents for the civilian population; some service professions such as military pilots, paratroopers and other airborne soldiers, aircraft carrier flight deck workers, Coast Guard sea rescue, ordnance or munitions workers, Naval firefighters, as well as those training or <b>drilling</b> in live <b>ammunition</b> exercises, all experience higher annual death rates. Such casualties are difficult, if not impossible, to keep hidden from children or teenagers in small base communities.|$|R
50|$|Irish {{language}} {{is the primary}} language when a body of soldiers is on the square, but in cases where live ammunition is used or where gun <b>drill</b> for live <b>ammunition</b> practice or deployment is being carried out, English commands are used {{to ensure that the}} order is fully understood. Examples of this substitution would be mounting the guard or artillery gun drill. Because foot and arm drill commands are passed down by word of mouth through training, the Irish commands have become distorted from their original pronunciations. In the same way that has occurred in the British Army (the subject of many parodies with screaming Sergeant Majors), words of command lose their defined pronunciation; examples being Aire (Arra) which often becomes Ahha and Cle (Kley) which is sometimes distorted to Hey or Huy.|$|R
50|$|On December 24, 1860, the South Carolina General Assembly {{made the}} state {{the first to}} ever secede from the Union. On January 9, 1861, Citadel cadets fired the first shots of the American Civil War when they opened fire on the Union ship Star of the West {{entering}} Charleston's harbor. On April 12, 1861, shore batteries {{under the command of}} General Pierre G. T. Beauregard opened fire on the Union-held Fort Sumter in the harbor. After a 34-hour bombardment, Major Robert Anderson surrendered the fort. Officers and cadets from The Citadel were assigned to various Confederate batteries during the bombardment of Fort Sumter. Although The Citadel continued to operate as an academy during the Civil War, cadets were made a part of the South Carolina military department along with the cadets from the Arsenal Academy in Columbia, to form the Battalion of State Cadets. Cadets from both institutions continued to aid the Confederate army by helping <b>drill</b> recruits, manufacture <b>ammunition,</b> protect arms depots, and guard Union prisoners.|$|R
500|$|On 23 April, Carmichael-Smyth {{announced}} a parade {{for the following}} day, during which {{the men of the}} regiment would be taught the new drill, using the muskets and ammunition which they had been using for years, rather than the new rifles or ammunition. During that evening, the men decided that they would not accept the cartridges; some approached a junior officer directly, and when they were told that none of the new cartridges were being used, they stated that using any type of cartridge would [...] "lay themselves open to the imputation from their comrades and from other regiments of having fired the objectionable ones." [...] These concerns were communicated to Carmichael-Smyth, who decided that the parade would go ahead as planned; during the night, Carmichael-Smyth's tent and some buildings were destroyed by fire. The following morning, 90 men, the regiment's carabiniers or skirmishers, were lined up to carry out the new parade <b>drill</b> using blank <b>ammunition.</b> When Carmichael-Smyth arrived at the parade ground, he found that no man had taken their ammunition, and he ordered the Havildar Major to carry out the drill. There was then an attempt to distribute the cartridges {{to the rest of the}} carabiniers but this was refused, despite a speech from Carmichael-Smyth reminding the men that the cartridges were the type they had been using for years. Out of 90 men, 85 refused the order to accept the ammunition.|$|R
