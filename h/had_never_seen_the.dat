5|$|A {{woman named}} Ning Gongyu {{provided}} {{most of the}} funds needed to construct the hall, and its construction was led by a monk named Yuancheng. In the 10th century, a depiction of Foguang Temple was painted in cave 61 of the Mogao Grottoes. However, it is likely the painters <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> temple, because the main hall in the painting is a two-storied white building with a green-glaze roof, {{very different from the}} red and white of the Great East Hall. This painting indicates that Foguang Temple was an important stop for Buddhist pilgrims. In 1137 of the Jin dynasty, the Manjusri Hall was constructed on the temple's north side, along with another hall dedicated to Samantabhadra, which was burnt down in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912).|$|E

5|$|Oscar Finley and Wally Figg are the bickering {{partners}} {{of a small}} law firm in the South Side of Chicago; in fact, {{for much of the}} time they are just a pair of ambulance chasers. Oscar's character holds the firm together despite the childish and unethical behavior of Wally, his junior partner. Their bickering is often mediated by Rochelle, the highly competent African American secretary, who had learned a lot of law in her eight years in the office. Meanwhile, David Zinc, a graduate of the Harvard Law School, is completely fed up with the grinding and dehumanizing – though well-paid – life of an associate in the law firm of Rogan Rothberg, where in five years of work he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> inside of a courtroom, in fact, David's expertise was in long-term bonds a job he hated. David suddenly breaks away, goes on a drinking binge and by chance finds himself at the Finley & Figg office. Feeling an elevating sense of freedom and vowing never to go back, Zinc willingly relegates himself to working for the two disreputable street lawyers and ambulance chasers.|$|E

However, his family is unwilling to risk losing Alluka or having her dangerous powers used against them, but after evading his older brother Illumi's attempts to intercept him, Killua manages to bring Alluka to Gon's side and have him fully recovered, before sealing her powers completely to ensure that she can have a normal life. Killua then parts ways with Gon, as he wants to travel the world with Alluka who <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> outside world before, while Gon himself finally meets his father and learns the true nature of his quest.|$|E
25|$|Navy {{nurses were}} on duty {{during the initial}} Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Kāneʻohe Bay, the Philippines, Guam, and aboard the Solace; they were vital in {{preventing}} further loss of life and limb. In fact, the nursing profession's vital role was quickly recognized and it became the only women's profession that was deemed so essential as to be placed under the War Manpower Commission. Despite shortages of qualified nurses during the war, the navy was able to hold to its standards and enroll nurses of outstanding qualifications and experience. These outstanding nurses received advanced training in surgery, orthopedics, anesthesia, contagion, dietetics, physiotherapy, and psychiatry, the latter helping men understand and manage Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome (then known as shell-shock) and battlefield fatigue. But the navy nurses' duties did not only include the tending to the injured and sick {{but also to the}} equally serious task of training Hospital Corpsmen. Many of these young men <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> inside of a hospital unless they themselves had been admitted, and as such it was training from the ground up. Once trained, the men were sent to work aboard fighting ships and on invasion beaches, where nurses were not yet officially assigned. Additionally, nurses trained WAVES for the Hospital Corps.|$|E

25|$|There are doubts {{though as}} to Gochiyaev's guilt. In November 2003, an article {{appeared}} in the weekly Moskovskiye Novosti, authored by an investigative journalist, Igor Korolkov. It described a meeting between Mikhail Trepashkin and Mark Blumenfeld, a former businessman who had rented the basement in the apartment house on Guryanov Street to Gochiyaev, in which Mr Blumenfeld stated {{that the person who}} was making use of the Laipanov passport, and who was publicly presented by the investigation as Gochiyaev, was not in fact Gochiyaev. In Lefortovo Prison, Blumenfeld had been shown a photo of someone he was told was Gochiyaev but Blumenfeld replied that he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> man but the investigators insisted that he identify Gochiyaev, at which point Blumenfeld ceased arguing and signed the document. The person who had met Blumenfeld was evidently not the same person depicted in the photograph but was, according to Blumenfeld, a man with a simple face whereas the person Blumenfeld had actually met looked externally like an intellectual. False-Laiponov had been seen by several persons. They all maintained that the original composite photo was very similar to the actual person who rented the storage facilities. The Russian Procuracy General unwittingly substantiated Trepashkin’s claim. Of the four storage premises named (two bombed and two not), the Delo (case) states that the witnesses for three, V.A. Avseev, Mark Blumenfeld and N.A. Gollubeva are not reported to have identified Gochiyaev as False-Laipanov. It should be noted that Blumenfeld’s account was different to the statement that he had signed for the FSB. One witness, Yu.E. Petrunkin, did identify a photograph of Gochiyaev as the man known by him as Laipanov. A driver, V.P.Sinitsyn, hired by False-Laipanov to deliver sacks of sugar, was not reported to have made an identification. Another hired driver, A.V.Prushinskii, stated that he was paid for his work by a man in glasses, about 1.8m tall, similar to the composite photo of Laipanov. It should be noted that Prushinskii was not shown an actual photo of Gochiyaev, even though one existed (it had been shown to Petrunkin).|$|E

He <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> show before, but was so impressed by the episode he decided to drive to Colorado and seek a job with Parker and Stone. He was hired as the show's editor after contacting one of the South Park animators who used to work for the same company as he had.|$|E
500|$|Such victim-centred {{propaganda}} had {{a powerful}} motivating effect. One Serbian volunteer said that he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> town before the war, but had come to fight because [...] "the Croats had a network of catacombs under the city where they killed and tortured children just because they were Serbs." [...] Reuters reported erroneously that forty-one children had been massacred in Vukovar by Croatian soldiers; although the claim was retracted a day later, it {{was used by the}} Serbian media to justify military action against Croatia. Many of those fighting at Vukovar believed that they were engaged in a struggle to liberate the town from a hostile occupier.|$|E

500|$|On July23, 1923, Raphael Beck, who had {{designed}} the seal for the 1901Pan-American Exposition, wrote to Mint Director Scobey {{to complain that}} the reverse design resembled his seal, which he had copyrighted in 1899, and that Beach should be given no further credit for it. The letter was forwarded to the Commission of Fine Arts for comment. In October, Fraser wrote to Beck, stating that he had suggested to Beach that he use figures to represent the continents instead of maps, and that he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> Pan-American seal until Scobey forwarded the letter.

500|$|Morse, who <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> show before, {{was unsure}} {{if he could}} portray the {{character}} and was not impressed after familiarizing himself with the show.

Initial critical responses to the character were mostly positive, but critics later felt that the seven-episode Tritter story arc became [...] "boring"; however, Morse was praised for his portrayal and gained an Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series Emmy Award nomination for his appearance in the episode [...] "Finding Judas". Morse stated in a 2006 TV Guide interview that, although he had discussed it with writers of the show, bringing the character back on the show would be [...] "practically impossible".|$|E
500|$|While {{the fort}} itself was never {{endangered}} by the British assault, Ticonderoga became a byword for impregnability. Even though the fort was effectively handed to the British by a retreating French army in 1759, future {{defenders of the}} fort and their superior officers, {{who may not have}} been familiar with the site's shortcomings, fell under the spell of this idea. In 1777, when General John Burgoyne advanced down Lake Champlain {{at the beginning of the}} Saratoga campaign, General George Washington, who <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> fort, thought highly of its defensive value. Anthony Wayne, who was at Fort Ticonderoga preparing its defenses before Burgoyne's arrival, wrote to Washington that the fort [...] "can never be carried, without much loss of blood". Fort Ticonderoga was surrendered by the Americans without much of a fight in July 1777.|$|E

[...] "For an actor, that's all you need, that's all you want. To get the acknowledgment and respect from your peers," [...] she said. She met with Nichelle Nichols, who explained to her how she had created Uhura's background and had named the character. Saldana's mother was a Star Trek fan and sent her voice mails during filming, giving advice on the part. Sydney Tamiia Poitier also auditioned for the part. The film officially establishes the character's first name, which had never been previously uttered on TV or in film. It also establishes (in an officially discreet manner) that Uhura and Spock are, in fact, lovers and had been romantically linked for some time during the film.|$|E
500|$|When {{auditioning for}} the role of Marita Covarrubias, Laurie Holden was not allowed access to an episode script, instead simply being told that her {{character}} worked for the United Nations and had an air of [...] "intelligent seriousness". The actress <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> series before she auditioned for the part, and was required to audition using only three pages of scripted material from what would be her debut episode. Holden was required to learn Russian for the episode [...] "Patient X", and commented that roughly fifteen seconds of screen-time took hours to rehearse. The voice coach responsible for instructing Holden and Nicholas Lea in their Russian dialogue tested their proficiency by asking them to speak to Russian-speaking friends of his over the telephone. Holden felt that the two-part episode [...] "Two Fathers" [...] and [...] "One Son" [...] offered her [...] "cold, emotionless, private" [...] character a chance to come across as [...] "vulnerable, exposed and raw".|$|E
500|$|While the Applewhites are {{regarded}} as the first major black characters on the series, Cherry stated {{that the role of}} Betty was originally offered to two white film actresses, both of whom turned it down due to financial and time commitment issues.

Desperate Housewives producers sent her fifteen episodes of the show, which she divided amongst various family members. After they compared storylines, Woodard recalled that she became [...] "instantly hooked" [...] on the series. Woodard reported experiencing heavy media attention after accepting the role. Both Brooks and his brother, Billy, auditioned for the role of Matthew. The final decision came down to both brothers as well as two other actors. According to Cherry, Brooks was cast because he exuded a [...] "dangerous" [...] element, as well as [...] "a combination of this wholesome, sweet quality and a dark, brooding quality." ...|$|E
