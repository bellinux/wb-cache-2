40|$|Content-based publish/subscribe {{networks}} (CPSNs) {{scale to}} {{large numbers of}} publishers and subscribers by having brokers summarize subscriptions from subscribers and downstream brokers based on coverage relationships (“subsumption”) between subscriptions. A broker forwards the summary to brokers which are upstream on the routes to the publishers. Current summarization and event processing mechanisms induce heavy event processing load on brokers, leading to low event throughput and high latency and further sharp performance degradation under high rates of churn, i. e., addition, deletion, or modification <b>of</b> <b>subscriptions.</b> This paper describes Beretta, a novel CPSN that leverages a simple model of typed events, enabling a succinct and uniform normalized representation <b>of</b> <b>subscriptions.</b> This in turn supports highly effective subsumption and attribute-wise split filtering with matching complexity logarithmic in the number <b>of</b> <b>subscriptions,</b> and enables the systematic introduction <b>of</b> parameters into <b>subscriptions</b> to support both parametric and structural updates. We empirically demonstrate that our techniques significantly improve throughput and latency of event propagation and reduce response times to subscription updates...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a problem that}} arises during the propagation <b>of</b> <b>subscriptions</b> in a content-based publish-subscribe system. Subscription covering is a promising optimization that reduces the number <b>of</b> <b>subscriptions</b> propagated, and hence the size of routing tables in a content-based publish-subscribe system. However, detecting covering relationships among subscriptions can be an expensive computational task that potentially reduces the utility of covering as an optimization. We introduce an alternate approach approximate subscription covering, which provide much of the benefits <b>of</b> <b>subscription</b> covering {{at a fraction of}} its cost. By forgoing an exhaustive search for covering <b>subscriptions</b> in favor <b>of</b> an approximate search, it is shown that the time complexity of covering detection can be dramatically reduced. The trade off between efficiency of covering detection and the approximation error is demonstrated through the analysis of indexes for multi-attribute subscriptions based on space filling curves. ...|$|R
