5|$|Synchronous {{spawning}} is very typical on {{the coral}} reef, and often, even when multiple species are present, all corals spawn {{on the same}} night. This synchrony is essential so male and female <b>gametes</b> can meet. Corals rely on environmental cues, varying from species to species, to determine the proper time to release <b>gametes</b> into the water. The cues involve temperature change, lunar cycle, day length, and possibly chemical signalling. Synchronous spawning may form hybrids and is perhaps involved in coral speciation. The immediate cue is most often sunset, which cues the release. The spawning event can be visually dramatic, clouding the usually clear water with <b>gametes.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some recent {{theoretical}} {{work has}} challenged the <b>gamete</b> competition theory, {{by showing that}} <b>gamete</b> limitation by itself {{can lead to the}} divergence of <b>gamete</b> sizes even under selection at the individual level. While this is possible, it has also been shown that <b>gamete</b> competition and <b>gamete</b> limitation are the ends of a continuum of selective pressures, and they can act separately or together depending on the conditions. These selection pressures also act in the same direction (to increase <b>gamete</b> numbers at the expense of size) and at the same level (individual selection). Theory also suggests that <b>gamete</b> limitation could only have been the dominant force of selection for the evolutionary origin of the sexes under quite limited circumstances, and the presence on average of just one competitor can makes the 'selfish' evolutionary force of <b>gamete</b> competition stronger than the 'cooperative' force of <b>gamete</b> limitation even if <b>gamete</b> limitation is very acute (approaching 100% of eggs remaining unfertilized).|$|R
50|$|The {{three main}} {{theories}} for {{the evolution of}} anisogamy are <b>gamete</b> competition, <b>gamete</b> limitation, and intracellular conflicts, but the last of these three is not well supported by current evidence. Both <b>gamete</b> competition and <b>gamete</b> limitation assume that anisogamy originated through disruptive selection acting on an ancestral isogamous population with external fertilization, due to a trade-off between larger <b>gamete</b> number and <b>gamete</b> size (which in turn affects zygote survival), because the total resource one individual can invest in reproduction is assumed to be fixed.|$|R

5|$|Lifespans {{range from}} 3 to over 30years. Adults of most species are of one sex {{throughout}} their lives. The gonads are masses of developing <b>gametes</b> (ova or sperm), and most species have four gonads, two in each valve. Those of articulates {{lie in the}} channels of the mantle lobes, while those of inarticulates lie near the gut. Ripe <b>gametes</b> float into the main coelom and then exit into the mantle cavity via the metanephridia, which open {{on either side of}} the mouth. Most species release both ova and sperm into the water, but females of some species keep the embryos in brood chambers until the larvae hatch.|$|E
5|$|The {{duplication}} {{and transmission}} of genetic material {{from one generation}} of cells to the next {{is the basis for}} molecular inheritance, and the link between the classical and molecular pictures of genes. Organisms inherit the characteristics of their parents because the cells of the offspring contain copies of the genes in their parents' cells. In asexually reproducing organisms, the offspring will be a genetic copy or clone of the parent organism. In sexually reproducing organisms, a specialized form of cell division called meiosis produces cells called <b>gametes</b> or germ cells that are haploid, or contain only one copy of each gene. The <b>gametes</b> produced by females are called eggs or ova, and those produced by males are called sperm. Two <b>gametes</b> fuse to form a diploid fertilized egg, a single cell that has two sets of genes, with one copy of each gene from the mother and one from the father.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} biotic and abiotic cues, such as {{individual}} genetics, foraging quantity and quality, or population density, may trigger the maturation of the reproductive organs {{and the production}} of <b>gametes</b> and thus determine sexual maturity. Like many reptiles, all marine turtles of a same aggregation are highly unlikely to reach sexual maturity at the same size and thus age.|$|E
50|$|Oogenesis is {{the process}} of female <b>gamete</b> {{formation}} in animals. This process involves meiosis (including meiotic recombination) occurring in the diploid primary oocyte to produce the haploid ovum (<b>gamete).</b> Spermatogenesis {{is the process}} of male <b>gamete</b> formation in animals. This process also involves meiosis (including meiotic recombination) occurring in the diploid primary spermatocyte to produce the haploid spermatozoon (<b>gamete).</b>|$|R

50|$|Sexual {{selection}} {{can occur}} within fungi {{if there is}} a limiting number of a certain type of <b>gamete.</b> The limited <b>gamete</b> is typically the female <b>gamete</b> as they tend to be more costly to produce and invest more, energetically, in the zygote.|$|R
5|$|Human {{activities}} have affected stocks of {{many species of}} teleost, through overfishing, pollution and global warming. Among many recorded instances, overfishing caused the complete collapse of the Atlantic cod population off Newfoundland in 1992, leading to Canada's indefinite closure of the fishery. Pollution, especially in rivers and along coasts, has harmed teleosts as sewage, pesticides and herbicides have entered the water. Many pollutants, such as heavy metals, organochlorines, and carbamates interfere with teleost reproduction, often by disrupting their endocrine systems. In the roach, river pollution has caused the intersex condition, in which an individual's gonads contain both cells that can make male <b>gametes</b> (such as spermatogonia) and cells that can make female <b>gametes</b> (such as oogonia). Since endocrine disruption also affects humans, teleosts are used to indicate the presence of such chemicals in water. Water pollution caused local extinction of teleost populations in many northern European lakes {{in the second half}} of the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|Only Phoronis ovalis {{naturally}} builds colonies by budding or by splitting into top {{and bottom}} sections which then grow into full bodies. In experiments, other species have split successfully, but only when both parts have enough gonadal (reproductive) tissue. All phoronids breed sexually from spring to autumn. Some species are hermaphroditic (have {{both male and female}} reproductive organs) but cross-fertilize (fertilize the eggs of other members), while others are dioecious (have separate sexes). The <b>gametes</b> (sperms and ova) are produced in the swollen gonads, around the stomach. The <b>gametes</b> swim through the metacoelom to the metanephridia. Sperm exit by the nephridiopores and some are captured by the lophophores of individuals of the same species. Species that lay small fertilized eggs release them into the water as plankton, while species with larger eggs brood them either in the body's tube or stuck {{in the center of the}} lophophore by adhesive. The brooded eggs are released to feed on plankton when they develop into larvae.|$|E
5|$|Species {{boundaries}} in plants may be weaker than in animals, and cross species hybrids are often possible. A familiar example is peppermint, Mentha × piperita, a sterile hybrid between Mentha aquatica and spearmint, Mentha spicata. The many cultivated varieties of wheat {{are the result}} of multiple inter- and intra-specific crosses between wild species and their hybrids. Angiosperms with monoecious flowers often have self-incompatibility mechanisms that operate between the pollen and stigma so that the pollen either fails to reach the stigma or fails to germinate and produce male <b>gametes.</b> This is one of several methods used by plants to promote outcrossing. In many land plants the male and female <b>gametes</b> are produced by separate individuals. These species are said to be dioecious when referring to vascular plant sporophytes and dioicous when referring to bryophyte gametophytes.|$|E

40|$|Unlike {{surrogacy}} and cloning, reproduction via <b>gamete</b> donation {{is widely}} {{assumed to be}} morally unproblematic. Recently, a number of authors have argued that this assumption is mistaken: <b>gamete</b> donors, they claim, have parental responsibilities that they typically treat too lightly. In this paper I argue that the 'parental neglect' case against <b>gamete</b> donation fails. I begin by examining and rejecting the view that <b>gamete</b> donors have parental responsibilities; I claim {{that none of the}} current accounts of parenthood provides good reason for ascribing parenthood to <b>gamete</b> donors. I then argue that even if <b>gamete</b> donors do have parental responsibilities for 'their' children, {{it is not clear that}} they treat these responsibilities too lightly. I conclude the paper by examining the wider question of just what kind of responsibilities <b>gamete</b> donors might have towards the children that they have a role in creating. 11 page(s...|$|R
5000|$|Trisomy 21 (47,XX,+21) {{is caused}} by a meiotic {{nondisjunction}} event. [...] A typical <b>gamete</b> (either egg or sperm) has one copy of each chromosome (23 total). When it is combined with a <b>gamete</b> from the other parent during conception, the child has 46 chromosomes. However, with nondisjunction, a <b>gamete</b> is produced with an extra copy of chromosome 21 (the <b>gamete</b> has 24 chromosomes). When combined with a typical <b>gamete</b> from the other parent, the child now has 47 chromosomes, with three copies of chromosome 21. The trisomy 21 karyotype figure shows the chromosomal arrangement, with the prominent extra chromosome 21.|$|R
5|$|Building {{upon the}} gene-chromosome theory of {{heredity}} that originated with Gregor Mendel (1822–1884), August Weismann (1834–1914) proved that inheritance only takes place through <b>gametes.</b> No other cells can pass on inherited characters. The work of Katherine Esau (1898–1997) on plant anatomy {{is still a}} major foundation of modern botany.

5|$|In glomeromycetes (formerly zygomycetes), haploid hyphae of two {{individuals}} fuse, forming a gametangium, a specialized cell structure {{that becomes a}} fertile gamete-producing cell. The gametangium develops into a zygospore, a thick-walled spore formed by the union of <b>gametes.</b> When the zygospore germinates, it undergoes meiosis, generating new haploid hyphae, which may then form asexual sporangiospores. These sporangiospores allow the fungus to rapidly disperse and germinate into new genetically identical haploid fungal mycelia.|$|E
5|$|Lifespans {{range from}} three to over thirty years. Ripe <b>gametes</b> (ova or sperm) float from the gonads into the main coelom and then exit into the mantle cavity. The larvae of inarticulate brachiopods are {{miniature}} adults, with lophophores that enable the larvae to feed and swim for months until the animals become heavy enough to settle to the seabed. The planktonic larvae of articulate species do not resemble the adults, but rather look like blobs with yolk sacs, and remain among the plankton {{for only a few}} days before leaving the water column upon metamorphosing.|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} I reject {{the claim that}} the {{responsibilities}} acquired by <b>gamete</b> providers can be transferred to their biological children’s intending parents. I defend this position by first showing that arguments in defence of the transferability of responsibilities in <b>gamete</b> provision cases fail to distinguish between the transfer and delegation of responsibility. I then provide an argument against the transferability of responsibilities in <b>gamete</b> provision cases that differs from the ones offered by James Lindemann Nelson and Rivka Weinberg. Though I conclude that <b>gamete</b> providers have inalienable responsibilities towards their biological offspring,I note that the precise ethical and policy implications this has for <b>gamete</b> provision remain somewhat unclear...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} is made using population genetic {{models of the}} evolution of <b>gamete</b> motility differences as a consequence of a pheromonal gametic approach mechanism. A stable swimming speed dimorphism may arise via disruptive selection on swimming speed, resulting from selection favouring a high efficiency of finding another <b>gamete</b> as well as a high probability of being found by another <b>gamete.</b> It is shown that no more than two different swimming speeds can coexist in a stable polymorphism. A specific relation is deduced between <b>gamete</b> swimming speed and the surface area of the volume around the <b>gamete</b> bounded by the critical pheromone concentration. It is concluded that an initial difference in swimming speed of at least twofold will lead to a stable dimorphism, and that evolution towards one of the <b>gamete</b> types becoming non-motile is very likely. ...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the process}} of <b>gamete</b> {{formation}} in plants has many unique features, much has been learnt from the comparative analysis between plants and other eukaryotic systems. Plants {{have a number of}} factors that have made them desirable for the analysis of <b>gamete</b> development; these include late germline specification, the non-lethality of mutations affecting <b>gamete</b> development and the large size of their chromosomes. The availability of the fully annotated Arabidopsis genome and com-parative analysis using yeast, animal and E. coli has led to the identification and functional characterisation of many genes with roles in <b>gamete</b> development, principally those associated with meiosis, recombination and DNA repair. The advantages that plants give with the use of mutant screens to identify genes associated with <b>gamete</b> formation have also provided access to genes that are difficult to characterise by alternative routes. This has yielded novel information regarding the processes of <b>gamete</b> formation in higher plants.

5|$|Most {{anthozoans}} are unisexual {{but some}} stony corals are hermaphrodite. The germ cells {{originate in the}} endoderm {{and move to the}} gastrodermis where they differentiate. When mature, they are liberated into the coelenteron and thence to the open sea, with fertilisation being external. To make fertilisation more likely, corals emit vast numbers of <b>gametes,</b> and many species synchronise their release in relation to the time of day and the phase of the moon.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses are gonochoric {{and have}} a single, posteriorly-located gonad which is {{associated}} with the coelom. The testis in males and the ovary in females bulges into the gonocoel and the <b>gametes</b> are released here. The gonocoel is connected by the gonoduct to the mantle cavity, which it enters at the gonopore. An optic gland creates hormones that cause the octopus to mature and age and stimulate gamete production. The gland may be triggered by environmental conditions such as temperature, light and nutrition, which thus control the timing of reproduction and lifespan.|$|E
5|$|Other merozoites {{develop into}} {{immature}} gametocytes, {{which are the}} precursors {{of male and female}} <b>gametes.</b> When a fertilized mosquito bites an infected person, gametocytes are taken up with the blood and mature in the mosquito gut. The male and female gametocytes fuse and form an ookinete—a fertilized, motile zygote. Ookinetes develop into new sporozoites that migrate to the insect's salivary glands, ready to infect a new vertebrate host. The sporozoites are injected into the skin, in the saliva, when the mosquito takes a subsequent blood meal.|$|E
25|$|Trisomy 18 (47,XX,+18) {{is caused}} by a meiotic {{nondisjunction}} event.

40|$|In angiosperms, a zygote {{generally}} divides into a two-celled proembryo {{consisting of}} an apical and a basal cell that possess different cell fates.

In this study, the <b>gamete</b> fusion site on the rice zygote was labelled by in vitro fertilization of a rice egg cell with a fluorescence-stained sperm cell. The positional relationship between the <b>gamete</b> fusion site and the division plane formed by zygotic cleavage was monitored using a fixed culture of the fusion site-labelled zygote until the two-celled proembryo stage.

40|$|Double {{fertilization}} is {{the defining}} characteristic of flowering plants. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating the fusion of one sperm with the egg and the second sperm with the central cell are largely unknown. We show that <b>gamete</b> interactions in Arabidopsis depend on small cysteine-rich EC 1 (EGG CELL 1) proteins accumulating in storage vesicles of the egg cell. Upon sperm arrival, EC 1 -containing vesicles are exocytosed. The sperm endomembrane system responds to exogenously applied EC 1 peptides by redistributing the potential <b>gamete</b> fusogen HAP 2 /GCS 1 (HAPLESS 2 /GENERATIVE CELL SPECIFIC 1) to the cell surface. Furthermore, fertilization studies with ec 1 quintuple mutants show that successful male-female <b>gamete</b> interactions are necessary to prevent multiple-sperm cell delivery. Our findings provide evidence that mutual <b>gamete</b> activation, regulated exocytosis, and sperm plasma membrane modifications govern flowering plant <b>gamete</b> interactions...|$|R
5|$|Sterility in a non-polyploid hybrid {{is often}} a result of {{chromosome}} number; if parents are of differing chromosome pair number, the offspring will have an odd number of chromosomes, which leaves them unable to produce chromosomally-balanced <b>gametes.</b> While that is undesirable in a crop such as wheat, for which growing a crop that produces no seeds would be pointless, it is an attractive attribute in some fruits. Triploid bananas and watermelons are intentionally bred because they produce no seeds and are also parthenocarpic.|$|E
5|$|Teleosts may spawn in {{the water}} column or, more commonly, on the substrate. Water column spawners are mostly limited to coral reefs; the fish will rush towards the surface and release their <b>gametes.</b> This appears to protect the eggs from some predators and allow them to {{disperse}} widely via currents. They receive no parental care. Water column spawners are more likely than substrate spawners to spawn in groups. Substrate spawning commonly occurs in nests, rock crevices or even burrows.

If a queen is absent, a termite king produces pheromones which encourage the development of replacement termite queens. As the queen and king are monogamous, sperm competition does not occur.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Iran is {{the only}} Islamic country in the Middle East which {{undertakes}} <b>gamete</b> donation, an assisted reproductive technology which has developed in the past 30 years. This study addresses the current situation and future potential of <b>gamete</b> donation in Iran {{in the context of}} the various cultural, legal and religious dilemmas which accompany it. This project utilizes a mixed methods approach, including in-formal group discussion and participant observation. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted with practitioners (N= 12) in three fertility centres as well as with the members of the Planning Committee of the Medical Ethics Centre of Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS) (N= 7). General information about the centres was also collected using a questionnaire (N= 3). The results of the study suggest that the practice of <b>gamete</b> donation can result in bioethical issues in the legal, socio-cultural, political and religious contexts in Iran. The identity of a child resulting from <b>gamete</b> donation is an important legal issue that overrides other issues such as inheritance. In addition, <b>gamete</b> donation creates new categories of relatedness involving genetic and social factors that generate socio-cultural complexity and ambiguity. The socio-cultural context in Iran may create specific stigmas and social pressures for the child, donor and recipient. Other issues that might occur include the exploitation of the donor, harassment and blackmail of the recipient, commercialisation of the whole procedure, and incest. In addition, the varieties of fatwas that have been raised in relation to <b>gamete</b> donation generate an unclear and ambiguous religious situation for patients, donors and physicians. Moreover, the results show a gap between permitting <b>gamete</b> donation by fatwas and its practice. The lack of specific laws, guidelines, unique codes of practice, and health policies related to <b>gamete</b> donation not only causes problems related to the practice of <b>gamete</b> donation, but also has considerable socio-cultural repercussions in Iran. This thesis also considers how the medical ethics curriculum of Tehran University of Medical Sciences can be adapted and further developed to address the issues raised by the use of this new bio-technology in the Iranian context. Analysis of the current medical ethics curriculum at TUMS, demonstrates that it offers physicians an ethical framework and also provides training related to some of the bioethical issues which are involved in <b>gamete</b> donation practices, although <b>gamete</b> donation has not been specifically included in this curriculum. In the absence of this type of medical ethics curriculum, <b>gamete</b> donation practices continue to be considered in a haphazard and informal way during teaching rounds in the clinical years. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Gamete</b> {{production}} for {{both males and}} females can be energetically expensive such that selection should maximize fertilization opportunities while minimizing fertilization costs. In laboratory studies of Drosophila reproduction, however, the failure of eggs to yield adult progeny can be quite high, suggesting that female control over <b>gamete</b> utilization is surprisingly inefficient. We examined <b>gamete</b> utilization in D. pseudoobscura from nature and compared our observations to those for laboratory populations. In natural populations 100 % of oviposited eggs effectively produce adult progeny, and fertilization is exclusively monospermic, indicating that in nature, D. pseudoobscura females maintain a very strict control over their reproduction such that <b>gamete</b> usage is extremely efficient. The potential reasons for the inefficient <b>gamete</b> utilization in the laboratory, as well as the potential impact on laboratory studies of sperm competition, sexual conflict, and the evolution of reproductive barriers are discussed. Furthermore, in this sperm-heteromorphic species, our observations show definitively that in nature, as well as in the laboratory, only the long sperm morph participates in fertilization...|$|R
