40|$|<b>District</b> <b>heating</b> is an {{environmentally}} friendly heating principle that {{is widely used}} in Sweden. A problem that has arisen is that while <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> dominates heating of apartment buildings, the <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> companies have difficulties competing in single-family houses. In Örebro, the 7 th largest city in Sweden, this problem causes some worries because of the environmental benefits with <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> compared to electricity-based heating alternatives which are more commonly used. The goal of this study has been to calculate the life cycle costs for <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> in Örebro from the house owner’s perspective and to compare these with the life cycle costs for heating by geothermal heat pumps. The study also examines the potential of a few proposed solutions for improved economy for <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> in areas with single-family houses. The calculations estimate the life cycle costs during 30 years for <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> to 697 kkr and 562 kkr for geothermal heat pumps. High energy costs being {{the primary reason for}} the district heating’s expensive outcome. A possible solution to improve the situation for <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> is the development of low temperature distribution. This could decrease the heat losses and thereby make <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> less expensive. Another solution that will make <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> more profitable in the future is <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> powered machines such as washing machines, dryers and dishwashers. The use of these machines replaces electricity consumption with heating consumption. For the use of these machines in houses with conventional <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> a separate pipe is needed which makes them not profitable at the moment. In Västerås, a city comparable to Örebro, low temperature grids are being developed with <b>district</b> <b>heated</b> machines in areas with newly built low energy houses. This solution uses a secondary grid with only one pipe for heating, heating of water and the <b>district</b> <b>heated</b> machines. The life cycle costs for this solution is 653 kkr, much less expensive than the conventional <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> in Örebro. An introduction of a similar solution in Örebro could make <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> in one-family houses more profitable, for both producer and consumer...|$|R

40|$|<b>District</b> <b>heating</b> {{provides}} {{more than half}} of the homes in Sweden with heating and hot water and have the potential to play an increasingly important role in the development towards fossil-free energy systems – yet it is rather unknown by the public. To understand why this is the case and to influence the situation, this research aims at exploring the <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> interface for people. In the first part of this research, I explored the interaction space of people and <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> in two research studies: (1) a diary study focusing on the role <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> plays in everyday pursuit of thermal comfort and (2) an interview study focusing on people’s ways of making sense and making use of <b>district</b> <b>heating.</b> The findings seem to suggest that <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> provides basic heating in a uniform manner, but that additional means often are used to achieve thermal comfort. The use of additional means, in combination with infrequent interaction with the heating system due to lack of (perceived) control over the heating, seems to obscure services available with <b>district</b> <b>heating.</b> Especially in apartments, people have been excluded from the <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> system in the sense that they do neither get any output (in the form of e. g. information or feedback) besides the <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> services, nor are they able to give much input (in the form of e. g. control) to the system. One reason for this is that heating costs generally are included in the rent. In the second part of this research, I integrated the findings from the first part into three possible directions to suggest how to redesign the <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> interface for people. The first direction represents making use of <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> in more ways than what is currently available. The second direction concerns enabling residents to be informed of the status and in control over the processes in the building’s central heating system as well as in the <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> system. The third direction is about designing means for thermal comfort and pleasurable thermal experiences through indirect use of <b>district</b> <b>heating.</b> Prior to this work, attempts of raising awareness about <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> have addressed people in their role as citizens through information about the beneficial characteristics of <b>district</b> <b>heating.</b> Instead I have tried a different path. The three design directions address people in their role as residents, occupants, and users by focusing on the services offered by <b>district</b> <b>heating.</b> Findings from an exploratory field study with prototypes based on the third direction seem to suggest that <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> services can be utilised to invite people to take a more conscious role with regard to their building’s heating system. Yet, for that consciousness to reach beyond the building’s heating system to the <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> system, the connection between the two systems must be very clear.

40|$|This report {{presents}} a pre-study {{with the aim}} to map today’s practice {{when it comes to}} the connection between <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> expansion and municipal spatial planning. The project was financed by the Swedish <b>District</b> <b>Heating</b> Association and the Swedish Energy Agency and was part of the research programme Fjärrsyn. A reference group consisting of three representatives from the <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> industry followed the progress of the project. The empirical studies were performed in two parts: one brief study and one deeper study. In the first part representatives from 55 Swedish local authorities were interviewed with the aim to map whether they had planned for new development areas in the last five years and, if so, whether the areas were connected to <b>district</b> <b>heating.</b> Based on the results from the first part six of the municipalities were chosen for a deeper study. The aim of the deeper study was to map the process from spatial planning to connection of new areas to <b>district</b> <b>heating,</b> and to identify barriers and drivers for such <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> expansion. Three respondents were interviewed from each municipality; a planner, an energy advisor and a representative from the <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> company. Results from the first part showed that most municipalities (90 %) that had planned for new developments in the last five years also possessed at least one area that was connected to <b>district</b> <b>heating.</b> The main reason for not connecting new areas was low profitability because of large distances and low heat demand. Also the deeper study indicated low profitability as the main reason for not connecting newly developed areas to <b>district</b> <b>heating.</b> Two other observations were made in the deeper study: Dialogue between <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> companies and local authorities is often sparse There are probably knowledge gaps and lack of understanding between spatial planners and <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> companies Empirical evidence from this study shows that the role of the <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> company in the planning process is often limited to calculating whether <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> expansion is economically feasible. There was however one exception to this general observation: in one municipality there is an ongoing dialogue with frequent meetings between representatives from the <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> company and the local authority. One reason for the sparse dialogue between planners and the <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> company can be the different professional cultures and different goals for the organisations. Another reason could be lack of knowledge about how spatial planning affects the conditions for <b>district</b> <b>heating.</b> More frequent dialogue between local authorities and <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> companies could improve the conditions for <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> in new developments. This dialogue should ideally start at the strategic level within municipal energy planning and overall planning. The dialogue should thereafter continue throughout the municipal planning process. Also broader cooperation between district hearing companies and local authorities could facilitate <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> expansion. Cooperation helps building common visions for the future local energy system, which in turn may also reduce vulnerability of joint projects. Based on the results from this pre-study, four new research projects were developed. One proposed project builds on the observation of the sparse dialogue between <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> companies and local authorities.
