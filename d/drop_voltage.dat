Charging the battery at high current at any temperature also gives rise to a high internal <b>voltage</b> <b>drop.</b> In some cases, the internal <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> can be as high as 1 volt per cell. Because the voltage available for charging is less than the terminal voltage by the amount of the internal <b>voltage</b> <b>drop,</b> the battery is not fully charged (see figure), even when the terminal voltage reaches the set value.
