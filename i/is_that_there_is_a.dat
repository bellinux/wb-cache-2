5|$|From a user's perspective, an HDMI display can {{be driven}} by a single-link DVI-D source, since HDMI and DVI-D define an {{overlapping}} minimum set of allowed resolutions and framebuffer formats to ensure a basic level of interoperability. In the reverse case a DVI-D monitor {{would have the same}} level of basic interoperability unless there are content protection issues with High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) or the HDMI color encoding is in component color space YCbCr which is not possible in DVI, instead of RGB. An HDMI source such as a Blu-ray player may demand HDCP-compliance of the display, and refuse to output HDCP-protected content to a non-compliant display. A further complication <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> small amount of display equipment, such as some high-end home theater projectors, designed with HDMI inputs but not HDCP-compliant.|$|E

25|$|Therefore, the {{assertion}} that an object R → R* is initial in E, that <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> morphism from it to any other element of E, means that the ring R* is a most efficient solution to our problem.|$|E
25|$|The general {{consensus}} in the field <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> derivational relationship between verbs undergoing the causative alternation that share the same lexical entry. From this it follows that there is uncertainty surrounding which form, the intransitive or the intransitive, is the base from which the other is derived. Another matter of debate is whether the derivation {{takes place at the}} syntactic or lexical level.|$|E
25|$|The {{continuum}} hypothesis {{was not the}} first statement shown to be independent of ZFC. An immediate consequence of Gödel's incompleteness theorem, which was published in 1931, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> formal statement (one for each appropriate Gödel numbering scheme) expressing the consistency of ZFC that is independent of ZFC, assuming that ZFC is consistent. The {{continuum hypothesis}} and the axiom of choice were among the first mathematical statements shown to be independent of ZF set theory.|$|E

25|$|The {{basis of}} the {{correspondence}} theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> relationship among the natural ("physical"), the spiritual, and the divine worlds. The foundations of this theory {{can be traced to}} Neoplatonism and the philosopher Plotinus in particular. With the aid of this scenario, Swedenborg now interpreted the Bible in a different light, claiming that even the most apparently trivial sentences could hold a profound spiritual meaning. Swedenborg argued that it is the presence of that spiritual sense which makes the Word divine.|$|E
25|$|A unique {{feature of}} these units <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{variable}} {{traction control system}} in their computer systems. One {{of the differences between}} an ES44AC and an ES44C4 are the air cylinders and linkages on the truck sideframes of the ES44C4; these are part of the traction control system. Every time a variation in grade, traction, or wheel slip occurs, the computer will adjust the pressure in these cylinders to maintain sufficient adhesion, by varying the weight on the drive axles.|$|E
25|$|The reason <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> cutoff used {{to define}} H, and the cutoff defines the {{shortest}} wavelength. Fluctuations of H at wavelengths near the cutoff can affect the longer-wavelength fluctuations. If the system is scaled along with the cutoff, the parameters will scale by dimensional analysis, but then comparing parameters doesn't compare behavior because the rescaled system has more modes. If the system is rescaled {{in such a way}} that the short wavelength cutoff remains fixed, the long-wavelength fluctuations are modified.|$|E

25|$|Another {{theory that}} is being {{examined}} to explain age related declines in working memory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> limit in attentional resources seen as we age. This means that older individuals are less capable of dividing their attention between two tasks, and thus tasks with higher attentional demands {{are more difficult to}} complete due to a reduction in mental energy. Tasks that are simple and more automatic, however, see fewer declines as we age. Working memory tasks often involve divided attention, thus {{they are more likely to}} strain the limited resources of aging individuals.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{focus on}} hierarchical order generated {{the impression that}} DGs have little to say about linear order, and it {{has contributed to the}} view that DGs are particularly well-suited to examine languages with free word order. A negative result of this focus on hierarchical order, however, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> dearth of dependency-based explorations of particular word order phenomena, such as of standard discontinuities. Comprehensive dependency grammar accounts of topicalization, wh-fronting, scrambling, and extraposition are mostly absent from many established dependency-based frameworks. This situation can be contrasted with constituency grammars, which have devoted tremendous effort to exploring these phenomena.|$|E
25|$|Many legends, both {{confirmed}} and unconfirmed, exist {{concerning the}} famous Hickman Tunnels. The most popular legend <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> tunnel from somewhere inside the school traveling to Jefferson Middle School. Many versions {{say that the}} tunnel {{is in a state}} of complete or partial disrepair, others state that it is still intact. The tunnels are still in tact 2015-2016 school year in Hickman's school news paper, 'The P', had a teacher that allowed them to go down into the tunnels and take pictures and the pictures they took were featured in the school newspaper.|$|E

25|$|In addition, one of {{the most}} {{important}} ("first rank") diagnostic symptoms of schizophrenia is the patient's delusion of being controlled by an external force. People with schizophrenia will sometimes report that, although they are acting in the world, they do not recall initiating the particular actions they performed. This is sometimes likened to being a robot controlled by someone else. Although the neural mechanisms of schizophrenia are not yet clear, one influential hypothesis <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> breakdown in brain systems that compare motor commands with the feedback received from the body (known as proprioception), leading to attendant hallucinations and delusions of control.|$|E
25|$|Adinarayana Swamy Temple is {{a temple}} {{dedicated}} to Lord Vishnu located at Pariyur {{and the chief}} deity the temple is Adhi Narayana Perumal. He is seen along with his companions Sri Devi and Bhu Devi. The specialty of the temple <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> separate shrine dedicated to Lord Hanuman. The statues of Sanjeevi Anjaneyar, Veera Anjaneyar and Alwars are seen inside the main temple complex. Garuda Alwar is seen {{in front of the}} main sanctum. The main Gopuram of the temple depicts the scene of narration of Bhagavad Gita, the holy book of Hindus. Vaikunta Ekadashi and other festivals of Vishnu are celebrated here.|$|E
25|$|Another {{motivation}} for using local alignments <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> reliable statistical model (developed by Karlin and Altschul) for optimal local alignments. The alignment of unrelated sequences tends to produce optimal local alignment scores which follow an extreme value distribution. This property allows programs {{to produce an}} expectation value for the optimal local alignment of two sequences, which {{is a measure of}} how often two unrelated sequences would produce an optimal local alignment whose score is {{greater than or equal to}} the observed score. Very low expectation values indicate that the two sequences in question might be homologous, meaning they might share a common ancestor.|$|E

25|$|Another {{study has}} {{demonstrated}} that sensory rheobases were no different in patients from those in age-matched control subjects, whereas motor rheobases were significantly lower. Discovering that motor axons have both a lower rheobase and a longer strength-duration time constant in ALS has prompted the conclusion that motor neurons are abnormally excitable in ALS, with properties more like those of sensory neurons. Changes in the geometry of the nerve due to loss of axons within the peripheral nerve likely cause this shift in rheobase. A logical conclusion of the present data <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> greater persistent Na+ conductance at rest in motor axons of patients with ALS than normal.|$|E
25|$|On a {{utilitarian}} basis, {{which has}} traditionally been used in welfare economics, an argument {{can be made for}} richer countries taking on most of the burdens of mitigation (Halsnæs et al., 2007). However, another result is possible with a different modeling of impacts. If an approach is taken where the interests of poorer people have lower weighting, the result <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> much weaker argument in favour of mitigation action in rich countries. Valuing climate change impacts in poorer countries less than domestic climate change impacts (both in terms of policy and the impacts of climate change) would be consistent with observed spending in rich countries on foreign aid (Hepburn, 2005; Helm, 2008:229).|$|E
25|$|A second interpretation, that Nash {{referred}} to by the mass action interpretation, is less demanding on players: ``t is unnecessary {{to assume that the}} participants have full knowledge of the total structure of the game, or the ability and inclination to go through any complex reasoning processes. What is assumed <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> population of participants for each position in the game, which will be played throughout time by participants drawn at random from the different populations. If there is a stable average frequency with which each pure strategy is employed by the ``average member of the appropriate population, then this stable average frequency constitutes a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. For a formal result along these lines, see Kuhn, H. and et al., 1996, The Work of John Nash in Game Theory, Journal of Economic Theory, 69, 153-185.|$|E
