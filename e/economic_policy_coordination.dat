40|$|This {{article is}} {{intended}} to present the new, (re) forming elements of <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> <b>coordination,</b> an instrument playing {{a central role in}} the EU. One important lesson drawn from the crisis is that in order for the EU to become a stable, dynamically growing economy – in addition to its internal market (in particular, the free movement of capital) and a single monetary policy – there is a need for efficient coordination, which should also be credible for the markets. <b>Economic</b> <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> – the alignment of national fiscal policies to one another and, for euro area Member States, to the common monetary policy – is a key issue, and the intention to reform it is closely related to the crisis management of the past two years. The proposals presented thus far indicate that EU policy makers are firmly committed to setting up <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> mechanisms which are far more efficient than those already in place. Accordingly, they will rigorously assess both fiscal and real economic imbalances, and after the imbalances have been identified, they will readily enforce corrective mechanisms, including sanctions more severe than those already in place. Rules governing crisis management will certainly be clearer; however, in order to minimise moral hazard, the common European rescue package will continue to have a hefty price tag. It is a warning sign, however, that despite firm policy intentions, markets remain rather sceptical about the reform of the fiscal framework and the ability to guarantee the sustainability of fiscal policies, as indicated by the sovereign credit risk premia, which by September had risen to the levels observed in May.

40|$|There are differing {{views about}} the need for <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> in the EU and about the {{adequacy}} of the system that has evolved under EMU. This article examines the case for such policy coordination, then describes and assesses the current arrangements for both ‘hard ’ coordination – epitomised by the much-maligned Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) – and the ‘soft ’ forms of coordination that have evolved in the EU to complement formal rules. Although the system achieves more than is sometimes recognised, it is shown to have weaknesses. Options for reforming the SGP and other facets of the system are discussed. A crucial question for the success of EMU is whether the combination of a monetary policy set by an independent, supranational central bank and fiscal (and other) policies controlled by national governments is conducive to both price stability and economic growth. Since the inception of the euro in 1999 and even during the period of convergence that preceded it, there has been a steady stream of criticism about the EU’s machinery for <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> (Buiter e...|$|E

After briefly setting out the framework for <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> established since Maastricht, it sheds light on the Lisbon strategy’s problem-laden legacy for the Europe 2020 strategy (2011 - 2020) : the issues of non-binding member state commitment to an EU-wide reform agenda, and of member state failure to create sufficient ownership of reform. The article then examines the workings of the Europe 2020 strategy – the EU’s economic and institutional modernisation strategy for the current decade – with regard to structural reform especially in the Eurozone. It addresses the question of the effectiveness of the European semester process in light of the sovereign debt crisis. The article concludes that the Europe 2020 strategy’s approach continues to be valid in the EU context, but that for the strategy to deliver member states must get their act together and create ownership of reform for national adjustment capacit...|$|E

40|$|There is {{a double}} {{asymmetry}} {{in the structure of}} economic and monetary union (EMU). First, monetary policy is uniform while national <b>economic</b> <b>policies</b> are merely co-ordinated.

This highlights the second asymmetry. The emphasis on credibility has been such that due regard has not been given to the legitimacy of the EMU policy architecture. If policy-making is to be effective, credible and legitimate, decisionmakers need to pay attention to four key legitimacy indicators: input, output, values and process. It seems inevitable that the success of the developing policy architecture and its effects, both in its monetary and economic dimension, will be judged against these broader standards...|$|R
