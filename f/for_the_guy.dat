500|$|Nutting {{ordered an}} initial {{production}} run of 1,500 units of Computer Space, an optimistic decision given that a hit arcade {{game at the}} time would sell around 2,000 units, though a handful had reached 10,000. Reception to the game from distributors was mixed; while some were excited by the game, others felt it to be confusing {{and part of a}} passing video game fad. By spring 1972 the game had sold over 1,000 units, and according to Bushnell in 1976 ended up selling between 1,300 and 1,500 units. While this was a commercial success, making over US$1,000,000, it was a disappointment to Nutting, who had been hoping for a large-scale success like Computer Quiz. The game's relative lack of success was attributed to the complexity of its controls and a steep learning curve, which pushed away customers used to less complex games. Bushnell noted that the locations that the game did well in, like the Dutch Goose playtest location, were generally located near university campuses; the general market for coin-operated games, however, was in working-class bars, where the patrons were less interested in deciphering a complicated game. In the documentary Video Game Invasion: The History of a Global Obsession, Bushnell explained, [...] "Sure, I loved it, and all my friends loved it, but all my friends were engineers. It was a little too complicated <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> with the beer in the bar." [...] Bushnell has also stated that part of the difficulty lay in the novelty of the game; he has said that even a few years later the controls and gameplay would have been more understandable to players who would have seen other video games by then. Conversely, Bushnell and Dabney have said that the game's novelty was also part of its appeal to players—most people had never seen a television screen displaying images being controlled by a person in front of it, rather than playing video from a remote television station.|$|E

2500|$|The song [...] "Hetero", with lyrics {{written by}} Stevenson, drew some {{negative}} remarks. Reviewing the band's May 25, 1995 performance at Irving Plaza, Jon Pareles of The New York Times called it [...] "openly homophobic, {{and it goes}} on to describe the narrator as a 'cigarette smokin', seal killin' redneck. Jon Ginoli, openly gay frontman of the queercore band Pansy Division, called it [...] "an obviously anti-gay backlash song. In it [...] proclaims himself as a normal straight guy who can't get laid, and he's blaming gay guys. What? In his words, 'the only way you're cool is if you're gay or dead'. Huh? 'Maybe I should pierce my butt or get a few tattoos / Maybe I should wear a dress and be a homo like you / Normal, hetero, straight guy / Yeah that's right, I'm a straight, normal, girl fuckin', coffee drinkin', titty suckin', cigarette smokin', seal killin', redneck-ass bastard from hell'. Hmm, I don't think the gay guys are to blame for that [...] Hearing the song, {{it was hard not to}} take it personally [...] At the same time I felt sad <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy,</b> who so obviously appeared threatened by gay people having more visibility and acceptance." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{he was in}} {{his late}} twenties, Tureaud won two tough-man {{competitions}} consecutively.

For the first event, Tureaud came in third place. For the end, two finalists squared off in a boxing ring for a two-minute round to declare the champion. Making it to the ring as a finalist, his opponent was a [...] Honolulu bouncer named Tutefano Tufi. Within twenty seconds [...] "Mr. T" [...] gave the six foot five competitor a bloody nose, and later a bloody mouth. He won the match and thus the competition. The second competition was aired under the new name [...] "Games People Play" [...] on NBC-TV. When interviewed by Bryant Gumbel before the final boxing match, Mr T. said, [...] "I just feel sorry <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> who I have to box. I just feel real sorry for him." [...] This fight was scheduled to last three rounds, but Mr. T finished it in less than 54 seconds. Sylvester Stallone's line, [...] "I don't hate him but...I pity the fool" [...] in the movie Rocky III is reputed to have been inspired by the interview.|$|E
2500|$|Renowned {{throughout}} his career for his capacity to provide very specific technical details about the performance of his cars and track conditions long {{before the advent of}} telemetry, this characteristic [...] led Senna's first F1 race engineer, Pat Symonds, to regard the US Grand Prix in Dallas as the initial highlight of Senna's debut season, instead of the more popular Monaco, where Senna and Toleman scored their first podium finish. This is by reference to the following recollection given by Symonds in an interview in 2014, to mark the 20th anniversary of Senna's death:The car was reasonably competitive there, so we expected to have a good race but Ayrton spun early in the race. He then found his way back through the field in a quite effective way and we were looking for a pretty good finish but then he hit the wall, damaged the rear wheel and the driveshaft and retired, which was a real shame. The real significance of that was that when he came back to the pits he told me what happened and said [...] "I'm sure that the wall moved!" [...] and even though I've heard every excuse every driver has ever made, I certainly hadn't heard of that one! But Ayrton being Ayrton, with his incredible belief in himself, the absolute conviction, he then talked me into going with him, after the race, {{to have a look at}} the place where he had crashed. And he was absolutely right, which was the amazing thing! Dallas being a street circuit the track was surrounded by concrete blocks and what had happened – we could see it from the tyre marks – was that someone had hit at the far end of the concrete block and that made it swivel slightly, so that the leading edge of the block was standing out by a few millimetres. And he was driving with such precision that those few millimetres were the difference between hitting the wall and not hitting the wall. While I had been, at first, annoyed that we had retired from the race through a driver error, when I saw what had happened, when I saw how he had been driving, that increased my respect <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> by quite a lot.|$|E

60|$|So {{that to me}} this {{extraordinary}} refusal of the allied nations under conditions that have always hitherto produced a Great Man to produce anything of the sort, {{anything that can be}} used as an effigy and carried about for the crowd to follow, is a fact of extreme significance and encouragement. It {{seems to me that the}} twilight of the half gods must have come, that we have reached the end of the age when men needed a Personal Figure about which they could rally. The Kaiser is perhaps the last of that long series of crowned and cloaked and semi-divine personages which has included Caesar and Alexander and Napoleon the First--and Third. In the light of the new time we see the emperor-god <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> he is. In the August of 1914 he set himself up to be the paramount Lord of the World, and it will seem to the historian to come, who will know our dates so well and our feelings, our fatigues and efforts so little, it will seem a short period from that day to this, when the great figure already sways and staggers towards the bonfire.|$|E
