5|$|In recent years, {{this latter}} {{argument}} has been fortified by {{the theory of}} connectionism. Many connectionist models of the brain have been developed in which the processes of language learning {{and other forms of}} representation are highly distributed and parallel. This would tend to indicate that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> such discrete and semantically endowed entities as beliefs and desires.|$|E
5|$|After {{seeing the}} last girl, Yogesh's mother beseeches him to choose with his heart {{instead of his}} mind. Yogesh sees all of the girls in a dream, {{and in the morning}} decides who he will marry. He goes to Rajni's office because she offered a 50-million-rupee dowry, and is {{relieved}} to discover that she is marrying someone else. Yogesh goes to Devu's house to tell him he wants to marry Vishakha, but Devu calls her and rejects her. He says there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> Yogesh to marry her; he knows about Jitu's debt, and says he will choose Yogesh's bride himself.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{assumption}} that man is a social animal, Saint-Just argues that in nature there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> contracts, legislation, or acts of force. These constructs only become necessary when a society is in need of moral regeneration and serve merely as unsatisfactory substitutes for the natural bonds of free people. Such constructs permit small groups to assume unwarranted powers which, according to Saint-Just, leads to corruption within society. Because a return to the natural state is impossible, Saint-Just argues for a government composed of the most educated members of society, who could be expected to share an understanding of the larger social good. Outside the government itself, Saint-Just asserts there must be full equality between all men, including equal security in material possessions and personal independence. Property must be protected by the state but, in order to secure universal independence, all citizens (including women) must own property.|$|E

5|$|Bears are {{generally}} bulky and robust animals with short tails. They are sexually dimorphic {{with regard to}} size, with males typically being larger. Larger species tend to show increased levels of sexual dimorphism in comparison to smaller species. Relying as they do on strength rather than speed, bears have relatively short limbs with thick bones to support their bulk. The shoulder blades and the pelvis are correspondingly massive. The limbs are much straighter {{than those of the}} big cats as there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> them to flex in the same way due to the differences in their gait. The strong forelimbs are used to catch prey, to excavate dens, to dig out burrowing animals, to turn over rocks and logs to locate prey, and to club large creatures.|$|E
5|$|The mid- to late 1970s saw the {{introduction}} of what are usually referred to as red dot sights, a type that gives the user a simple bright red dot as an aiming point. The typical configuration for this sight is a compact curved mirror reflector design with a red light-emitting diode (LED) at its focus. Using an LED as a reticle is an innovation that greatly improves the reliability and general usefulness of the sight: there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> other optical elements to focus light behind a reticle; the mirror can use a dichroic coating to reflect just the red spectrum, passing through most other light; and the LED itself is solid state and consumes very little power, allowing battery-powered sights to run for hundreds and even {{tens of thousands of}} hours.|$|E

25|$|Under this view, {{researchers}} posit {{that there}} are no differences in the mechanisms underlying creativity in those used in normal problem solving; and in normal problem solving, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> creativity. Thus, creativity and Intelligence (problem solving) are the same thing. Perkins referred to this as the ‘nothing-special’ view.|$|E
25|$|Canada's provincially based Medicare {{systems are}} {{cost-effective}} {{partly because of}} their administrative simplicity. In each province, each doctor handles the insurance claim against the provincial insurer. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> the person who accesses healthcare {{to be involved in}} billing and reclaim. Private insurance represents a minimal part of the overall system.|$|E
25|$|Control systems: No {{signalling}} {{systems are}} needed for high-speed rail, because such systems are computer controlled. Human operators cannot react fast enough to manage high-speed trains. High speed systems require dedicated rights of way and are usually elevated. Two maglev system microwave towers are in constant contact with trains. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> train whistles or horns, either.|$|E

25|$|There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> {{a variety}} of plans because {{virtually}} all essential basic care is covered, including maternity and infertility problems. Depending on the province, dental and vision care may not be covered but are often insured by employers through private companies. In some provinces, private supplemental plans are available for those who desire private rooms if they are hospitalized.|$|E
25|$|Oyster uses a {{distributed}} settlement framework. All {{transactions are}} settled between {{the card and}} reader alone. Readers transmit the transactions to the back office in batches but there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> this {{to be done in}} real time. The back office acts mainly as a record of transactions that have been completed between cards and readers. This provides a high degree of resilience.|$|E
25|$|The Shared Memory Net-Lib, on {{the other}} hand, manages {{connections}} between multiple instances of SQL Server that exist on one computer. It uses a shared memory area to communicate between the processes. This is inherently secure; there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> data encryption between instances of SQL Server that exist on one computer as the operating system does not allow any other process access to the instances' area of shared memory.|$|E

25|$|People with A-T have an {{increased}} sensitivity to ionizing radiation (X-rays and gamma rays). Therefore, X-ray exposure {{should be limited to}} times when it is medically necessary, as exposing an A-T patient to ionizing radiation can damage cells {{in such a way that}} the body cannot repair them. The cells can cope normally with other forms of radiation, such as ultraviolet light, so there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> special precautions from sunlight exposure.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} Buddhist texts, and as {{taught by the}} modern Theravada school, the goal of {{becoming}} a teaching Buddha in a future life is viewed as the aim {{of a small group}} of individuals striving to benefit future generations after the current Buddha's teachings have been lost, but in the current age there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> most practitioners to aspire to this goal. Theravada texts do, however, hold that this is a more perfectly virtuous goal.|$|E
25|$|High {{concentrations}} of cytosolic citrate can inhibit phosphofructokinase, the catalyst {{of one of}} the rate-limiting steps of glycolysis. This effect is advantageous: high {{concentrations of}} citrate indicate that there is a large supply of biosynthetic precursor molecules, so there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> phosphofructokinase to continue to send molecules of its substrate, fructose 6-phosphate, into glycolysis. Citrate acts by augmenting the inhibitory effect of high concentrations of ATP, another sign that {{there is no need to}} carry out glycolysis.|$|E
