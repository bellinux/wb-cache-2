40|$|Wallonia and the Canary Islands {{are both}} regions with {{legislative}} capacities within the European Union (EU). They have traditionally shared serious socio-economic deficits. Therefore, while a new European Regional policy was being designed, they both built regional strategies {{in order to}} extract {{as much as they}} can from the EU. How far are these Sub-State activations towards Brussels linked to regional gains (outputs) from the EU? How different are both mobilisations? How can the higher degree of success of the Canary Islands be explained, taking into account that the Archipelago is far away from the heart of Europe and Wallonia is within it? The research, based on a qualitative analysis method, will be carried out through findings about the regional mechanisms developed to influence the European institutions: the participation (direct and non direct) within the Council of Ministers, the Committee of the Regions, the regional interaction with the European Commission, the establishment of representative bodies in Brussels and the participation within <b>interregional</b> <b>associations...</b>|$|R

40|$|Comprehension of {{conventional}} and novel metaphors involves traditional language-related cortical regions {{as well as}} non-language related regions. While semantic processing is crucial for understanding metaphors, it is not sufficient. Recently the precuneus {{has been identified as}} a region that mediates complex and highly integrated tasks, including retrieval of episodic memory and mental imagery. Although the understanding of non-literal language is relatively easy for healthy individuals, people with schizophrenia exhibit deficits in this domain. The present study aims to examine whether people with schizophrenia differentially recruit the precuneus, extending to the superior parietal cortex (SPL), to support their deficit in metaphor comprehension. We also examine <b>interregional</b> <b>associations</b> between the precuneus/SPL and language-related brain regions. Twelve people with schizophrenia and twelve healthy controls were scanned while silently reading literal word pairs, conventional metaphors, and novel metaphors. People with schizophrenia showed reduced comprehension of both conventional and novel metaphors. Analysis of functional connectivity found that the correlations between activation in the left precuneus/SPL and activation in the left PSTS were significant for both literal word pairs and novel metaphors, and significant correlations were found between activation in the right precuneus/SPL and activation in the right PSTS for the three types of semantic relations. These results were found in the schizophrenia group alone. Furthermore, relative to controls, people with schizophrenia demonstrated increased activation in the right precuneus/SPL. Our results may suggest that individuals with schizophrenia use mental imagery to support comprehension of both literal and metaphoric language. In particular, our findings indicate over-integration of language and non-language brain regions during more effortful processes of novel metaphor comprehension...|$|R

(ICA) "This {{detailed}} {{history of}} a pawnshop company and its chairman in Saint Petersburg (Russia) {{is part of a}} research project titled 'The role of pawnshops in the life strategies of low-income households', financed by the Volkswagen-Foundation. The researched institution named Ob'jedinionnyj Lombard (United Lombard) is a successful pawnshop company in Saint Petersburg covering a market share of somewhere between 35 % and 50 %. In addition to pawnbroking it runs a buy-and-sell shop named Ob'jedinonnyj Torgovyj Dom (United Trading House) and has ambitions to expand its business abroad. In addition to its own pawnshop service, the firm offers franchising to other pawnshops in Russia and developed particular computer programs for this business. The chairman of this firm, Nikolaj Bobrov, a former military officer, and his associates in the firm's management are entrepreneurs of modern type, who took the chance of liberation of the Russian economy. However, the management has to always reflect upon the politicoeconomic conditions in Russia in their decision-making. These make business a risky venture and set narrow limits to future planning.

In Argentina, presidential elections will take place in October 2015 and will assuredly bring an end to Kirchnerismo.

40|$|Graph {{representations}} of brain connectivity have attracted {{a lot of}} recent interest, but existing methods for dividing such graphs into connected subnetworks {{have a number of}} limitations in the context of neuroimaging. This is an important problem because most cognitive functions would be expected to involve some but not all brain regions. In this paper we outline a simple approach for decomposing graphs, which may be based on any measure of <b>interregional</b> <b>association,</b> into coherent "principal networks". The technique is based on an eigendecomposition of the association matrix, and is closely related to principal components analysis. We demonstrate the technique using cortical thickness and diffusion tractography data, showing that the subnetworks which emerge are stable, meaningful and reproducible. Graph-theoretic measures of network cost and efficiency may be calculated separately for each principal network. Unlike some other approaches, all available connectivity information is taken into account, and vertices may appear in none or several of the subnetworks. Subject-by-subject "scores" for each principal network may also be obtained, under certain circumstances, and related to demographic or cognitive variables of interest...|$|E
40|$|As part {{of their}} plans to diversify and globalize their foreign relations, the EU and MERCOSUR have been working to {{establish}} closer links. They have a project to create an <b>interregional</b> <b>Association</b> based on political dialogue, cooperation and trade issues.

There is competition between Europe and the USA in the Southern Cone. While the EU has often provided support for institution building in MERCOSUR, the latter has frequently been destabilized by US regionalist strategy. The USA has often taken advantage of its special relationship with Argentina. However, the open crises that Argentina has faced since December 2001, and the US attitude towards the crises, appear to have affected the Buenos Aires foreign policy alignment with Washington. What geopolitical consequences could this have for the area? And what is the US position on this development?

40|$|The article {{attempts}} {{to characterize the}} basic theoretical aspects of marketing in cross-border cooperation. It has been found that, in the current context of the IT sector development, it is of substantial relevance to apply the benefits of online marketing together with integrating it into the international regional cross-border economic relations. The author’s own conception {{of the use of}} interactive marketing to further improve interaction of the entities of neighbouring countries in various areas of cross-border cooperation (CBC) has been proposed. A layout of web site interface of the interactive cross-border business center has been developed on the example of the euroregional formation of member countries in the <b>Interregional</b> <b>Association</b> «Carpathian Euroregion».

40|$|ABSTRACT: Avalanche {{accidents}} show a {{very high}} mortality rate that ranges from 60 % to 70 %, i. e. much {{higher than that of}} traffic accidents (3 % of casualties every 100 accidents). The study of ava-lanche accidents thus offers a basis to understand the dynamics of the event and search for neces-sary prevention strategies in a field that ranges from anthropised zones subject to preventive control to recreational and sports activities in leisure time. In Italy, the most exhaustive database is managed by AINEVA (the snow and avalanche <b>interregional</b> <b>association),</b> whose activities also include gathering of data and information on avalanche accidents, in order to determine, from the analysis of events, be-havioral lines and useful actions aimed at reducing risk. This work follows the one carried out in 2003 by Valt et al. which analysed twenty years of data (1984 - 2003) and, from one hand it is an update of the previous one, and from the other provides new viewpoints of the problem. Therefore the work illus-trates the results of the analyses carried out on more than 950 avalanche accidents included in the information archives of AINEVA and compared with the results from similar works carried out abroad. The period considered goes from the winter season 1984 - 85 to 2008 - 09 (25 years). For the analyses of the morphological features of avalanches, the sample of data available is more limited (roughly 500 accidents), but is well-distributed within the period considered. For the analysis of the number of casu-alties the sample available is more comprehensive, going from 1967 to 2009 (41 years) ...|$|E
