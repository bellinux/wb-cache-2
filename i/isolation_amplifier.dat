40|$|This paper {{concentrates}} on the selection of radiation tolerant <b>isolation</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> which are suitable for the signal conditioners for cryogenic system in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The evolution {{and the results of}} different commercial isolation amplifiers’ parameters under neutron and gamma radiation are presented. In most cases, the tested isolation amplifiers’ input offset voltage, bias currents and output offset voltage hardly changed during the radiation. The {DC} gain in input stage was only affected for some <b>isolation</b> <b>amplifiers</b> with a small open loop gain.

In addition, results on 1 B 41 signal conditioner showed that it was tolerant to 7 – 8 × 1012 |$|R
50|$|However, if {{the sum of}} {{the normal}} mode and common mode {{voltages}} exceeds either the differential amplifier’s common mode range, or maximum range without damage then the need for an <b>isolation</b> <b>amplifier</b> is firmly established.|$|E
50|$|Packages for {{microwave}} frequency devices {{are arranged to}} have minimal parasitic inductance and capacitance in their leads. Very-high-impedance devices with ultralow leakage current require packages that do not allow stray current to flow, and may also have guard rings around input terminals. Special <b>isolation</b> <b>amplifier</b> devices include high-voltage insulating barriers between input and output, allowing connection to circuits energized at 1 kV or more.|$|E
50|$|The op-amp is {{one type}} of {{differential}} amplifier. Other types of differential amplifier include the fully differential amplifier (similar to the op-amp, but with two outputs), the instrumentation amplifier (usually built from three op-amps), the <b>isolation</b> <b>amplifier</b> (similar to the instrumentation amplifier, but with tolerance to common-mode voltages that would destroy an ordinary op-amp), and negative-feedback amplifier (usually built from one or more op-amps and a resistive feedback network).|$|E
50|$|<b>Isolation</b> <b>amplifiers</b> {{may include}} {{isolated}} power supplies {{for both the}} input and output stages, or may use external power supplies on each isolated portion.|$|R
50|$|Similar to the {{instrumentation}} <b>amplifier,</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>amplifiers</b> have fixed {{differential gain}} {{over a wide}} range of frequencies, high input impedance and low output impedance.|$|R
50|$|The {{frequency}} of the common mode voltage can adversely affect performance. Higher frequency common mode voltages create difficulty for many <b>isolation</b> <b>amplifiers</b> due to the parasitic capacitance of the isolation barrier. This capacitance appears as a low impedance to higher frequency signals, and allows the common mode voltage to essentially blow past the barrier and interfere with measurements, or even damage the amplifier. However, most common mode voltages are a composite of line voltages, so frequencies generally remain in the 50 to 60 Hz region with some harmonic content, well within the rejection range of most <b>isolation</b> <b>amplifiers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The first {{indicator}} that {{common mode voltage}} magnitude is competing with the normal mode component is a noisy reproduction of the latter at the amplifier’s output. Such a situation does not usually define {{the need for an}} <b>isolation</b> <b>amplifier,</b> but rather a differential amplifier. Since the common mode component appears simultaneously and in phase on both amplifier inputs, the differential amplifier, within the limits of the amplifier’s design, can reject it.|$|E
50|$|An {{operational}} amplifier, or op-amp, is a {{differential amplifier}} with very high differential-mode gain, very high input impedance, and low output impedance. An op-amp differential amplifier {{can be built}} with predictable and stable gain by applying negative feedback (Figure 5). Some kinds of differential amplifier usually include several simpler differential amplifiers. For example, a fully differential amplifier, an instrumentation amplifier, or an <b>isolation</b> <b>amplifier</b> are often built {{from a combination of}} several op-amps.|$|E
50|$|A transformer-isolated {{amplifier}} {{relies on}} transformer coupling of a high-frequency carrier signal between input and output. Some models {{also include a}} transformer-isolated power supply, that may {{also be used to}} power external signal processing devices on the isolated side of the system. The bandwidth available depends on the model and may range from 2 to 20 kHz. The <b>isolation</b> <b>amplifier</b> contains a voltage-to-frequency converter connected through a transformer to a frequency-to-voltage converter. The isolation between input and output is provided by the insulation on the transformer windings.|$|E
50|$|<b>Isolation</b> <b>amplifiers</b> are {{a form of}} {{differential}} amplifier that allow measurement of small signals {{in the presence of}} a high common mode voltage by providing electrical isolation and an electrical safety barrier. They protect data acquisition components from common mode voltages, which are potential differences between instrument ground and signal ground. Instruments that are applied {{in the presence of a}} common mode voltage without an isolation barrier allow ground currents to circulate, leading in the best case to a noisy representation of the signal under investigation. In the worst case, assuming that the magnitude of common mode voltage or current is sufficient, instrument destruction is likely. <b>Isolation</b> <b>amplifiers</b> are used in medical instruments to ensure isolation of a patient from power supply leakage current.|$|R

The high speed DC circuit breakers are used to protect the superconducting coils in case of a quench. The input power will be interrupted by opening the emergency dump circuit breakers.|$|R
5000|$|Where {{the circuit}} is {{grounded}} (earthed) on one side, a current measuring shunt can be inserted {{either in the}} ungrounded conductor or in the grounded conductor. A shunt in the ungrounded conductor must be insulated for the full circuit voltage to ground; the measuring instrument must be inherently isolated from ground or must include a resistive voltage divider or an <b>isolation</b> <b>amplifier</b> between the relatively high common-mode voltage and lower voltages inside the instrument. A shunt in the grounded conductor may not detect leakage current that bypasses the shunt, {{but it will not}} experience high common-mode voltage to ground. The load is removed from a direct path to ground, which may create problems for control circuitry, result in unwanted emissions, or both.|$|E
50|$|The {{intrinsic}} {{resistance of}} a conducting element, usually a copper trace in Printed circuit Board(PCB) can use {{be used as}} sensing element instead of a shunt resistor. Since no additional resistor is required this approach promises a low-cost and space saving configuration with no additional power losses either. Naturally, the voltage drop of a copper trace is very low due to its very low resistance, making {{the presence of a}} high gain amplifier mandatory {{in order to get a}} useful signal.There are several physical effects which may alter the current measurement process: thermal drift of the copper trace, initial conditions of the trace resistance etc. Therefore, this approach is not suitable for applications that require a reasonable accuracy due to the large thermal drift. In order to overcome the problems associated with the temperature drift, a digital controller can be used for thermal drift compensation and calibration of the copper trace.A significant drawback of this kind of current sensor is the unavoidable electrical connection between the current to be measured and the sense circuit. By employing a so-called <b>isolation</b> <b>amplifier,</b> electrical isolation can be added. However, these amplifiers are expensive and can also deteriorate the bandwidth, accuracy and thermal drift of the original current sensing technique. For these reasons, current sensing techniques based on physical principles that provide intrinsic electrical isolation deliver a better performance at lower costs in applications where isolation is required.|$|E

Change in dietary pattern where fresh food is replaced by processed and fast food along {{with the increase of}} stress has led to rise of cardio-vascular disease which is glaringly evident in developing countries. Especially, Asians are more prone to cardio-vascular diseases genetically. The ECG device is a diagnostic medical instrument which determines the electrical activity of the heart. The conventional ECG devices are powered by mains electricity, thus are not energy efficient. Transformers used make the device bulky and expensive.

40|$|During this work-term I {{modified}} {{and fixed}} an existing <b>isolation</b> <b>amplifier.</b> As well I integrated {{it into an}} Aerotech motor controller package by rewiring the back panel.

Once complete I tested the system under a variety of conditions in different places to compare it to a second (unmodified) Aerotech motor controller package. In doing so I found many flaws with the testing setup and how it should be configured, which is included in the report. The reason to make an <b>isolation</b> <b>amplifier</b> is to eliminate "ground loop" noise in the analog rpm and current data, which is being derived from the motor controller system and recorded on the Data Collection System. By utilizing an <b>Isolation</b> <b>Amplifier</b> to interrupt the ground path, which occurs by connecting the Motor Controller analog output data directly to the Data Acquisition System ground loop, noise is eliminated. The <b>isolation</b> <b>amplifier</b> makes use of the AD 210, a wide bandwidth 3 2 ̆ 014 port <b>isolation</b> <b>amplifier.</b> This chip uses transformer coupling to separate grounds. Therefore the data you receive is actually your true signal. When modifying the <b>isolation</b> <b>amplifier</b> it helps to use the accompanying diagrams, schematics, and tables.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{applications}} {{where it is}} desirable, or even essential, for a sensor to have no direct ("galvanic") electrical connection with the system {{to which it is}} supplying data. This might be {{in order to avoid the}} possibility of dangerous voltages or currents from one half of the system doing damage in the other, or to break an intractable ground loop. Such a system is said to be "isolated", and the arrangement that passes a signal without galvanic connections is known as an isolation barrier. The protection of an isolation barrier works in both directions, and may be needed in either, or even in both. The obvious application is where a sensor may accidentally encounter high voltages, and the system it is driving must be protected. Or a sensor may need to be isolated from accidental high voltages arising downstream, in order to protect its environment: examples include the need to prevent the ignition of explosive gases by sparks at sensors and the protection from electric shock of patients whose ECG, EEG or EMG is being monitored. The ECG case is interesting, as protection may be required in both directions: the patient must be protected from accidental electric shock, but if the patient's heart should stop, the ECG machine must be protected from the very high voltages (> 7. 5 kV) applied to the patient by the defibrillator which will be used to attempt to restart it.

40|$|The {{literature}} on bone growth, fracture healing, fracture treatment {{and the effects}} of forces and movements on these is reviewed. Some methods of assessing the progress of fracture union are considered. The conclusion from this is that a fracture movement transducer is needed for use on an external fracture fixator, and the design criteria are outlined. The possible types of transducers are considered and a system of light falling on lateral effect photodetectors was used. The linearizing algorithms applicable to the employed detectors are discussed and tested. The electronic circuits were designed and revised, initially to produce a reasonable power consumption, and then to give a system with reduced noise levels and improved linearity. <b>Isolation</b> <b>amplifiers</b> were required to prevent leakage currents reaching the patient from the mains powered computer. The algorithms relating the movements of the transducer to the movements at the fracture site were derived, including the use of elasticity theory to calculate the bending of the fixator pins.

The transducer was calibrated, and consideration was given to the effect of the fixator pins loosening in the bone. Seven patients, all with tibial fractures, six injured in road traffic accidents and one footballing injury, were tested and their clinical histories were reviewed.

40|$|In {{a process}} monitoring/control {{applications}} tens {{to thousands of}} sensors are used for monitoring system parameters. To achieve overall system goals, their reliable performance is critical. Generally a sensor’s output signal is too small or too noisy {{and may not be}} compatible with the input requirements of a Data Acquisition System. The sensor is interfaced to Data Acquisition System, through cabling, junction boxes and Interface Electronics like excitation circuitry, multiplexers, signal-conditioning circuitry etc. An interface or signal conditioning circuit does impedance matching, filtering, multiplexing, pre-amplification, amplification and digitization to make the sensor’s output signal compatible with the Data Acquisition System. Conventional Signal Conditioning includes Multiplexers, Anti aliasing filters, Operational <b>Amplifier,</b> Instrumentation <b>Amplifiers,</b> <b>Isolation</b> <b>Amplifiers</b> and Charge Preamplifiers etc. Operational Amplifiers e. g. voltage followers with High input impedance and low output impedance are used for impedance matching between the sensor and processing electronics. Anti aliasing filters remove noise from the sensor’s output signal. Normally the sensor is located away from the processing electronics and data is transmitted through wires/cables. During transmission, interference from external fields’ especially strong Audio Frequency, Radio Frequency and 50 Hz power line fields affects the sensor’s output signal. To minimize the effect of external field twisted pair shielded cables are used. Amplifiers with Differential input configuration are used to suppress the effect of interfering signals. Differential input Instrumentation Amplifiers with High input impedance, high CMRR; are most widely employed. <b>Isolation</b> <b>Amplifiers</b> isolate the input and output circuits by an extremely high impedance. Galvanic, optical isolations are most common. The conditioned data is transmitted to Data Acquisition System (DAS) and at the DAS the signal is multiplexed, filtered and digitized using Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs), followed by Digital Filtering and processing. For Control applications, the processed data is converted back to analog form using Digital to Analog Converters (DACs) for interfacing to external world. The transmission distance varies from tens of centimeters to few meters. Depending upon the distance twisted pair cables, IR transmission and Optical transmission is employed. During transmission, the data is prone to interferences from EMI, EMC, Noise and Signal to Noise ratio (SNR) degradation with distance. This affects the reliability of the system and increases the overall system cost. To eliminate the effects due to the environmental disturbances during transmission and to maintain signal integrity, it is preferred to have a unique and compact solution for each sensor where signal conditioning (excitation, filtering, amplification, compensation and digitization) is carried out and digital data can be transmitted to Data Acquisition System. Here each sensor has its own signal conditioning module. Directly interfacing sensors with micro controller yields simple and compact design solutions. Direct Sensor interface Technology (DSiT) is one {{of the state of the}} art technologies for sensor interfaces where an unconditioned, uncompensated, raw output signals from sensors are interfaced directly to a single-chip solution. The sensors’ output are multiplexed using Multiplexer; Amplified using Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA), digitized using ADC, filtered using Digital Filters and transmitted using Digital Interfaces (SPI, I 2 C, UART) in a single chip. DSiT scheme incorporates all the elements necessary in an instrumentation system creating a balanced combination of features, to create truly intelligent sensor systems. The sensors are interfaced directly to a single DSiT chip, without any additional circuitry and the direct digital data transmission is achieved with the help of Digital Interfaces SPI, UART, SMBus/I 2 C. As this involves onchip signal conditioning and digital data transmission, expenditure on additional signal conditioning circuitry, analog interfaces for analog data transmission, separate Analog to Digital Converter for each sensor is reduced. This reduces the overall system cost and as the count of discrete components is reduced the system reliability is improved. In addition, as the data is transmitted digitally the effects of noise, S/N degradation and electromagnetic interferences are eliminated. The accuracy level achieved is sufficiently good for monitoring and control applications. In Launch Vehicles/Satellites number of sensors are used for performance evaluation, monitoring and control purposes. Harnessing, signal conditioning of the sensors’ output and onboard processing of the sensor data is carried out individually for each sensor. Implementation of the DSiT system will reduce the total weight of the launch vehicles and satellites, resulting in reduced overall system cost, increased reliability and reduced onboard processing overhead. In addition, the reduction in weight allows incorporation of larger payloads/ more propellant loading in payloads which increases the life of the Satellites. As it is compact, it can be readily used for facility parameter measurements during the ground testing of liquid engines and stages at LPSC/ISRO. Implementation of DSiT for facility parameter measurements will reduce the cabling cost and improve the reliability of the chain...|$|R
