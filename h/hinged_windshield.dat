2500|$|The design {{goals for}} the A-28 {{included}} twin engines for safety over hazardous terrain, a payload of [...] with four seats, 10 hours endurance, as well as good short and rough field capabilities. The resulting design features a cantilever low-wing, a four-seat enclosed cabin accessed through a <b>hinged</b> <b>windshield,</b> a T-tail, fixed conventional landing gear and twin engines in tractor configuration.|$|E
50|$|The CN {{series was}} an in house {{development}} of AD Basov available since 1977. The CN is available with 4x4, 6x6 and 8x8 wheel configurations and 3 to 10 ton cargo capacity. The CN Series feature a rectangular shaped all-metal cab with horizontally grooved doors and side panels, flat front end and a sloping <b>hinged</b> <b>windshield.</b> Vehicles {{are equipped with}} license built MAN D2156 6-cylinder diesel engines and a 5- or 6 -speed transmission, 2-speed transfercase, wheel planetary gear drives, wheels with lockable differentials, dual airbrakes, power steering and a 24-volt electrical devices.|$|E
5000|$|... "The {{most radical}} feature {{of his car}} was the novel {{suspension}} of its six-cylinder engine so as to cut down vibration. The engine was supported on three points and rested on rubber mounts. Noise and vibration were much less. There was {{still a lot of}} movement of the engine when idling, but under a load it settled down. Although it was a great success in the Plymouth, Henry Ford did not like it. For no given reason, he just didn't like it, and that was that. I told Walter that I felt it was {{a step in the right}} direction, that it would smooth out all noises and would adapt itself to axles and springs and steering-gear mounts, which would stop the transfer of road noises into the body. Today rubber mounts are used on all cars. They are also found on electric-motor mounts, in refrigerators, radios, television sets—wherever mechanical noises are apparent, rubber is used to eliminate them. We can thank Walter Chrysler for a quieter way of life. Mr. Ford could have installed this new mount at once in the V&#8209;8, but he missed the value of it. Later Edsel and I persuaded him. Rubber mounts are now found also in doors, <b>hinges,</b> <b>windshields,</b> fenders, spring hangers, shackles, and lamps—all with the idea of eliminating squeaks and rattles." ...|$|R
50|$|In late 1967 (1968 model year), US-spec cars {{received}} several safety additions: a padded fascia (dashboard) with smaller main gauges, collapsible steering column, scissor-type hood <b>hinges,</b> a third <b>windshield</b> wiper, additional side marker lights, and anti-burst door latches. The rear axle gear ratio was increased from 4.22:1 to 3.9:1, giving 16.5 mph for every 1000 rpm. This increased {{final drive ratio}} gave the 1275 model slightly better fuel economy than the 1098 model.|$|R
50|$|Some {{vehicles}} were modified {{in the field}} by front seat passengers opening the top <b>hinged</b> passenger side <b>windshield</b> up and using a light machine gun such as the Type 11 light machine gun, the Type 96 light machine gun, or the Type 99 light machine gun {{in a similar fashion}} with a motorcycle sidecar. Because of its small dimensions and weight, it was able to fit inside Japanese manufactured Kokusai Ku-8 and deploying glider Airborne troops, specifically the Teishin gliding infantry regiment, and some cars also used an Autocannon machine gun.|$|R
