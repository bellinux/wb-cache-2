40|$|Aim To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} difficulties in managing ethical dilemmas in family practice. Methods The study included {{a random sample of}} 259 family medicine physicians, representing 30 % of the population of family physicians in Slovenia. Participants were <b>given</b> <b>a</b> <b>self-administered</b> <b>questionnaire</b> on perceived ethical dilemmas in their practice, with responses on a 5 -point scale and a maximum score of 100. The main outcome measure was the percentage of family physicians reporting difficulties in solving perceived ethical dilemmas. Results The response rate was 55 %. Physicians reported having difficulties in solving ethical dilemmas often or very often (mean score ± standard deviation, 56. 1 ± 12. 1). The most difficult ethical is-sue included abandoned and unattended patients and patients with insufficient means of support (48. 6 %), followed by suspicion of physi-cal abuse, sexual abuse, or other criminal behavior (40. 9 %), and us...|$|E

In a cross-sectional study, 149 sewage workers and 138 referents, selected from among other municipal workers, were <b>given</b> <b>a</b> <b>self-administered</b> <b>questionnaire</b> about asthma, atopy, smoking and symptoms from the airways, skin and eyes. Two-by-two statistics was used to compare proportions and logistic regression was used for multivariable analyses. The sewage workers reported significantly more adult asthma than the referents. The adjusted odds ratio for asthma during adulthood was 5. 3 (95 % confidence interval 1. 1 – 26) as determined from a multivariable logistic regression analysis when controlling for age, gender, atopic disposition and tobacco smoking. They also had increased risk, but not statistically significant, of some possibly asthma related symptoms and chronic bronchitis. There was no difference in atopic disposition based on a history of allergic diseases in childhood or in parents. Neither were there any differences in symptoms in the eyes or skin. Self-reported asthma was more common among the sewage workers than other municipal workers. This might be caused by occupational exposure to irritant or inflammatory substances...|$|E
40|$|Aim To assess patients’ {{attitudes toward}} {{changing}} unhealthy lifestyle, {{confidence in the}} success, and desired involvement of their family physicians in facilitating this change. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study in 15 family physicians’ practices on a consecutive sample of 472 patients (44. 9 % men, mean age (± standard deviation) 49. 3 ± 10. 9 years) from October 2007 to May 2008. Patients were <b>given</b> <b>a</b> <b>self-administered</b> <b>questionnaire</b> on attitudes toward changing unhealthy diet, increasing physical activity, and reducing body weight. It also included questions on confidence in the success, planning lifestyle changes, and advice from family physicians. Results Nearly 20 % of patients planned to change their eating habits, increase physical activity, and reach normal body weight. Approximately 30 % of patients (more men than women) said {{that they wanted to}} receive advice on this issue from their family physicians. Younger patients and patients with higher education were more confident that they could improve their lifestyle. Patients who planned to change their lifestyle and were more confident in the success wanted to receive advice from their family physicians.

40|$|Smoking in {{adolescence}} {{is a great}} health concern as it is related to many chronic diseases and mortality in later life. It is also associated with other high-risk behaviours among adolescents. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the prevalence and reasons for smoking among upper secondary schoolboys. This was a cross-sectional study conducted among Form 4 and Form 5 students. Three schools in the District of Hulu Langat were identified and students from these schools were selected randomly. The students were <b>given</b> <b>a</b> <b>self-administered</b> <b>questionnaire.</b> A total of 343 students were included in the study. The prevalence of smoking among the schoolboys was 37 %. Although the majority of them initiated smoking between 13 - 15 years old (67 %), 21 % of them began smoking below 12 years of age (primary school). There was a significant association between adolescent smoking and smoking among family members (p< 0. 05). The common reasons reported for initiating smoking were curiosity (69 %) and peer pressure (51 %). However, the common reasons for continuing smoking were stress (70 %) and addiction (49 %). Schoolwork was reported as the most important factor which contributed to their stress. Smoking prevention programmes should begin early in primary schools.

40|$|At theirfirst {{visit to}} a {{hospital}} clinic 178 patients referred with a diagnosis of hypertension were <b>given</b> <b>a</b> <b>self-administered</b> <b>questionnaire.</b> They received a similar questionnaire 12 months later. Of the 178 patients 99 were not initially on treatment. Similarly 78 normotensive subiects were drawn randomly from the local population and sent a second questionnaire 10 months later. The symptoms at the first visit of the normo-tensive controls, the untreated hypertensive patients, and 477 patients on long-term treatment in the hyper-tension clinic were compared. Treated and untreated hypertensive patients complained more of nocturia and also of unsteadiness either on standing or in the morning. Treated hypertensives complained more of sleepiness, dry mouth, diarrhoea, and, in men, impotence and failure of ejaculation. Similarly, untreated hypertensives complained of excessive depression, blurred vision, and waking headache. Fifty-five of the normotensive sutbects and 110 of the newly referred hypertensive patients responded to the second questionnaire. The proportions losing and gaining symptoms were calculated together with the proportions always complaining and never complaining of a symptom. Hypertensive patients tended ts lose the complaints of unsteadiness and headache but to gain the symptoms of vivid dreams, a slow walking pace, and diarrhoea.

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the level of knowledge of general dental practitioners (GDPs) in Tabriz, Northwest of Iran, regarding endocarditis prophylaxis in cardiac patients receiving dental treatments. Materials and methods. This was a cross-sectional, descriptive, analytical study that included 150 GDPs. All practitioners were <b>given</b> <b>a</b> <b>self-administered</b> <b>questionnaire</b> which consisted of three parts as-sessing their knowledge of cardiac diseases requiring prophylaxis, dental procedures requiring prophy-laxis, and antibiotic regimen for endocarditis prophylaxis. Statistical analysis of data was carried out using independent t-test, one-way ANOVA and chi-square test. Results. The level of knowledge among GDPs in three areas of cardiac diseases requiring prophylaxis, dental procedures requiring prophylaxis, and antibiotic regimen for endocarditis prophylaxis were 63. 7 %, 66. 8 % and 47. 7 %, respectively. Their overall level of knowledge regarding endocarditis prophy-laxis was 59 %. Association of the level of knowledge with age and practice period was statistically sig-nificant (P 0. 05). Conclusion.

These can vary from urban to rural areas, survival period {{and according to the}} type of cancer. We here aimed to describe demographics and psychosocial analysis of cancer survivors three to five years post-treatment in rural Australia and also assess relationships with financial stress and quality of life domains. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 65 participants visiting the outpatient oncology clinic were <b>given</b> <b>a</b> <b>self-administered</b> <b>questionnaire.</b> The inclusion criteria included three to five years post-treatment. Three domains were investigated using standardised and validated tools such as the Standard Quality of Life in Adult Cancer Survivors Scale (QLACS) and the Personal and Household Finances (HILDA) survey. Included were demographic parameters, quality of life, treatment information and well-being. Results: There was no evidence of associations between any demographic variable and either financial stress or cancer-specific quality of life domains. Financial stress was however significantly associated with the cancerspecific quality of life domains of appearance-related concerns, family related distress, and distress related to recurrence. Conclusions: This unique study effectively points to psychosocial aspects of cancer survivors in rural regions of Australia. Although the majority of demographic characteristics were not been found to be associated with financial stress, this latter itself is significantly associated with distress related to family and cancer recurrence.

In 1989, 2, 729 members of the group were <b>given</b> <b>a</b> <b>self-administered</b> <b>questionnaire</b> that included questions on changes in sexual behavior that subjects had made in response to the epidemic of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The final sample of 1, 601 young, heterosexual, urban respondents included 412 white men, 568 white women, 224 black men, and 397 black women, all ages 21 to 40 years. Overall, nearly 50 percent of the sample reported having made at least one change in their sexual behavior in response to the AIDS epidemic to decrease their risk of becoming infected by the human immunodeficiency virus. The mean number of changes was 0. 8 for white men, 1. 1 for white women, 1. 6 for black men, and 1. 5 for black women. Change was reported more frequently by black respondents than white, with no significant sex differences. The categories of respondents reporting behavior changes were more often young, with a history of recreational drug use, with more sex partners, or having had anal intercourse. The most commonly reported behavior changes were reducing the number of sex partners and being more careful in partner selection.

Methods: During the initial visit, the neurologist <b>gave</b> patients <b>a</b> <b>self-administered</b> <b>questionnaire</b> containing 72 questions regarding previous symptoms lasting more than 24 hours. During the follow-up visit the neurologist validated the symptoms and collected information about the current attack. Results: The cohort included 178 patients (74 % women, mean age (±SD) 33. 7 (± 10. 1) years). The main reason for the initial visit was visual disturbance and sensory troubles in limbs. Mean (±SD) global EDSS score was 1. 4 (± 1. 1), 46 % of brains MRIs were positive according to Barkhof-Tintoré criteria, 41 % had abnormal WBC count in CSF and 71 % had IgG oligoclonal bands. Prior symptoms suggestive of demyelination were reported by 79 patients (44 %), validated by the neurologist for 70 % (55 patients) and identified only by the neurologist in four patients.

One of the preventive measures is the vaccination of teenagers against oncogenic human papilloma virus. The {{aim of this study}} was to find out the level of knowledge mothers possess about these vaccines and their willingness to administer vaccination to their teenage girls. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional descriptive study of 255 consecutive women attending antenatal clinic at the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, Abuja. They were <b>given</b> either <b>a</b> <b>self-administered</b> <b>questionnaire</b> or interviewer-administered questionnaire containing both closed and open-ended questions. Information recorded includes socio-demographic variables, knowledge of cervical cancer, knowledge of HPV/HPV vaccines and acceptance of these vaccines for their adolescent girls. The data was analysed using descriptive statistics. Results: The mean age of the respondents was 26. 9 years. Over 90 % had at least secondary education. A total of 102 (40 %) had the knowledge of cancer of the cervix while 153 (60 %) had never heard about it. Overall, 236 (92. 5 %) of them had no idea about the predisposing factors. The study showed that only 23 (9. 0 %) out of the total respondents had heard about human papilloma virus (HPV) infection. In the same vein, 20 (7. 8 %) had knowledge about HPV vaccine.

40|$|Background: Ultrasound {{examination}} {{forms an}} integral part of antenatal care both in high risk and normal pregnancies. Even though it acts as a source of reassurance about the well-being of her baby and also a source of connecting with her baby in the antenatal period, for many pregnant mothers in India it is still only a tool for sex determination and its other major uses remain in the background. Fear regarding its safety and doubts about its necessity are also prevalent among pregnant women. The {{purpose of this study is}} to assess the knowledge of antenatal mothers regarding the uses of ultrasound during pregnancy and also to assess their attitude towards ultrasound. Methods: This is a descriptive cross sectional study carried out in Sri Manakula Vinayagar medical college and hospital, Puducherry, India between the periods of April 2014 to July 2014. 300 pregnant women were selected by simple random sampling among patients attending the antenatal clinic for routine checkup irrespective of their parity. After obtaining informed consent, these women were <b>given</b> <b>a</b> predesigned, <b>self-administered</b> <b>questionnaire</b> in local language that had questions on socio demographic data, knowledge regarding use of ultrasound in pregnancy, attitude towards ultrasound, source of information about ultrasound and awareness regarding PNDT act. The data was entered in SPSS and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: Although awareness regarding the indications for USG during pregnancy was found to be fairly good among the participants, 36 % of the them assumed determination of sex in utero as an indication for ultrasound. 88 % of them considered ultrasound as safe and 98 % considered it essential. 26 % of the pregnant women considered that sex determination was permissible by law. Most of them obtained information regarding ultrasound from health providers and the role of media was negligible. Conclusions: Awareness regarding the uses of USG during pregnancy and attitude towards ultrasound was good but knowledge about recommendations of PNDT act was lacking in pregnant women and so every possible route particularly extensive media coverage can be used to create awareness regarding the recommendations of the PNDT act to the public.

Materials and Methods: A total of 230, 6 th and 7 th standard students were <b>given</b> <b>a</b> <b>self-administered</b> <b>questionnaire</b> for assessing their baseline knowledge about management of common injuries followed by educational intervention with a systematically devised teaching module during February to March 2016. Post intervention evaluation of their knowledge acquisition was done after 2 weeks with same questionnaire. Results: The baseline knowledge on the management of selected injuries was found to be insufficient among the study subjects. Paired t-test was performed to compare the pre- and post-test scores of knowledge and attitude of the students about first aid, and there was a significant change in knowledge from pretest score (mean = 1. 50, standard deviation [SD] = 0. 47) to posttest score (mean = 6. 53, SD = 1. 30). To quantify the effectiveness of health education, effect size (Cohen's d) was derived. For knowledge score, Cohen's d was 5. 14 with large effect size indicating highly effective impact of the training program. Significant change was also noticed regarding attitude regarding first aid as evident from increase in pretest score (mean = 1. 19, SD = 0. 96) to posttest score (mean = 3. 17, SD = 1. 03); Cohen's d was 1. 88 with medium effect size. Conclusion: Inculcating first-aid training in the school curriculum can be a fruitful investment in ensuring proper and timely management of illnesses and injuries not only for the school children but also for the community at large...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the stress level among Yemeni dentists and to evaluate their stress manifestations and stress management. Materials and methods: Nearly 368 dentists were <b>given</b> <b>a</b> <b>self-administered</b> <b>questionnaire</b> and 119 returned the filled questionnaire form. A questionnaire was composed of four sections including, demographic information, professional practice characteristics, work stress factors and response of dentist to stress as well as methods to deal with stress. 56 females and 63 males were incorporated, 83. 2 % of them were general dental practitioners. The descriptive data were analyzed and Chi-square, t-test and F tests were used for statistical significance (P< 0. 05). Results: The response rate was 32. 3 %. Of the whole, 71. 4 % of them were aged less than 30 years, 73. 1 % have experience less than 5 years. Among stressors, those related to dental procedure have highest mean scores (SD) of stress 2. 93 (1. 46). The most prevalent factors that contribute to stress were uncooperative patients (72. 3 %), amount of work (too much, too little) (60. 5 %) and constant drive for technical perfection (54. 6 %). Stress was reflected in dentists by many signs among them are musculoskeletal fatigue in 63 % and nervousness in 57. 1 %. Praying and reading the Quran was reported by over two thirds (70. 6 %) of the participants to manage stress. Conclusions: Dentistry is a stressful profession in Yemen. Lack of experience, low income, uncooperative patients, and dental procedure-related factors were the main significant factors that caused stress. Political instability in the country and the lack of laws governing the dental profession in addition to conservative nature of the community may be considered as sources of stress...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Children {{with a low}} {{socioeconomic}} position {{are more}} affected by mental difficulties as compared to children with a higher socioeconomic position. This paper explores whether this socioeconomic pattern persists in the prosperous German city of Munich which features high {{quality of life and}} coverage of children mental health specialists that lies well above the national average and is among the highest in Europe. Methods 1, 265 parents of preschool children participated in a cross-sectional health survey. They were <b>given</b> <b>a</b> <b>self-administered</b> <b>questionnaire</b> (including socioeconomic variables) and the 'Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) ', a well-established method to identify mental difficulties among children and adolescents. Prevalence estimates for the 'SDQ-Total Difficulties Score' were calculated, with a special focus on differences by parental (resp. household) socioeconomic position. The association between parental education, household income, single parenthood, nationality, and parental working status on one hand, and their children's mental health on the other, was explored using multivariable logistic regression models. The coverage of mental health specialists per 100, 000 children aged 14 or younger in the city of Munich was also calculated. Results In Munich, the distribution of mental health difficulties among children follows the same socioeconomic pattern as described previously at the national level, but the overall prevalence is about 30 % lower. Comparing different indicators of socioeconomic position, low parental education and household income are the strongest independent variables associated with mental difficulties among children (OR = 2. 7; CI = 1. 6 - 4. 4 and OR = 2. 8; CI = 1. 4 - 5. 6, respectively). Conclusions Socioeconomic differences in the prevalence of childhood mental difficulties are very stable. Even in a city such as Munich, which is characterized by high quality of life, high availability of mental health specialists, and low overall prevalence of these mental difficulties, they are about as pronounced as in Germany as a whole. It can be concluded that the effect of several characteristics of socioeconomic position 'overrules' the effect of a health promoting regional environment. </p...|$|E

A group of buprenorphine office-based practice prescribers was selected {{to participate in this}} study. They were asked to screen for inclusion all their patients coming for a visit from February to August 2002. Once included by their prescribing physician, patients were <b>given</b> <b>a</b> series of <b>self-administered</b> <b>questionnaires</b> to be returned directly to the research staff, independently of their prescriber. Each prescriber was <b>given</b> <b>a</b> questionnaire to complete based on their knowledge and interview of the patient. Items assessed were history of current treatment, current substance use, buprenorphine treatment related behavior (daily frequency of intake, route of administration), benzodiazepine use and existence of a major depressive episode. Prescribers and patients&rsquo; questionnaires were compared. Concordance of both assessments was assessed by kappa statistics. The sensitivity and specificity as well as the positive and negative predictive values of prescriber collected information were compared to that of their patients&rsquo;. There was an overall good correlation between both data sources on the procedures for buprenorphine use especially for intravenous use of buprenorphine. There were important variations: obtaining buprenorphine without a prescription or with a prescription made by another doctor, intravenous administration of buprenorphine, use of benzodiazepines, and depression were underestimated by prescribers.

40|$|Abstract Background Well-documented {{shortages}} {{of health care}} workers in sub-Saharan Africa are exacerbated by the increased human resource demands of rapidly expanding HIV care and treatment programmes. The successful continuation of existing programmes is threatened by health care worker burnout and HIV-related illness. Methods From March to June 2007, we studied occupational burnout and utilization of HIV services among health providers in the Lusaka public health sector. Providers from 13 public clinics were <b>given</b> <b>a</b> 36 -item, <b>self-administered</b> <b>questionnaire</b> and invited for focus group discussions and key-informant interviews. Results Some 483 active clinical staff completed the questionnaire (84 % response rate), 50 staff participated in six focus groups, and four individuals gave interviews. Focus group participants described burnout as feeling overworked, stressed and tired. In the survey, 51 % reported occupational burnout. Risk factors were having another job (RR 1. 4 95 % CI 1. 2 – 1. 6) and knowing a co-worker who left {{in the last year}} (RR 1. 6 95 % CI 1. 3 – 2. 2). Reasons for co-worker attrition included: better pay (40 %), feeling overworked or stressed (21 %), moving away (16 %), death (8 %) and illness (5 %). When asked about HIV testing, 370 of 456 (81 %) reported having tested; 240 (50 %) tested in the last year. In contrast, discussion groups perceived low testing rates. Both discussion groups and survey respondents identified confidentiality as the prime reason for not undergoing HIV testing. Conclusion In Lusaka primary care clinics, overwork, illness and death were common reasons for attrition. Programmes to improve access, acceptability and confidentiality of health care services for clinical providers and to reduce workplace stress could substantially affect workforce stability. </p...|$|R

40|$|At {{their first}} visit to a {{hospital}} clinic 178 patients referred with a diagnosis of hypertension were <b>given</b> <b>a</b> <b>self-administered</b> <b>questionnaire.</b> They received a similar questionnaire 12 months later. Of the 178 patients 99 were not initially on treatment. Similarly 78 normotensive subjects were drawn randomly from the local population and sent a second questionnaire 10 months later. The symptoms at the first visit of the normotensive controls, the untreated hypertensive patients, and 477 patients on long-term treatment in the hypertension clinic were compared. Treated and untreated hypertensive patients complained more of nocturia and also of unsteadiness either on standing or in the morning. Treated hypertensives complained more of sleepiness, dry mouth, diarrhoea, and, in men, impotence and failure of ejaculation. Similarly, untreated hypertensives complained of excessive depression, blurred vision, and waking headache. Fifty-five of the normotensive subjects and 110 of the newly referred hypertensive patients responded to the second questionnaire. The proportions losing and gaining symptoms were calculated together with the proportions always complaining and never complaining of a symptom. Hypertensive patients tended to lose the complaints of unsteadiness and headache but to gain the symptoms of vivid dreams, a slow walking pace, and diarrhoea. The net improvement for a symptom {{was defined as the}} excess of patients who lost a symptom over those who gained the symptom, expressed as a percentage. Over the follow-up period the control subjects had a net improvement averaged over 14 symptoms of + 2 - 4 per cent. A similar result was obtained for the hypertensive patients of + 2 - 0 per cent, the symptoms lost being balanced by those gained. The changes in symptoms with time were related to the changes in blood pressure and it is suggested that only headache, 'unsteadiness, lightheadedness, or faintness' and nocturia can actually result from raised blood pressure and then only in a proportion of patients complaining of these symptoms...|$|E
40|$|Microbial {{volatile}} organic compounds (MVOCs) are a type of VOCs produced by microorganisms. Exposure to 1 -octen- 3 -ol, one of the known MVOCs, {{has been reported to}} reduce nasal patency and increase nasal lavage myeloperoxidase, eosinophil cationic proteins, and lysozymes in both experimental and field studies. We reported in a previous paper that 1 -octen- 3 -ol exposure at home is associated with mucosal symptoms. In this study, our aim was to investigate the relationship between asthma and allergies and MVOC exposure in single-family homes. The subjects were 624 inhabitants of 182 detached houses in six regions of Japan. Air samples were collected using diffusive samplers, and the concentrations of eight selected MVOCs were analyzed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry in selected-ion-monitoring mode. Each inhabitant of each of the dwellings was <b>given</b> <b>a</b> <b>self-administered</b> <b>questionnaire.</b> Among the 609 subjects who answered all of the questions about allergies, history of the medical treatment for asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and allergic conjunctivitis within the preceding two years was 4. 8 %, 9. 9 %, 18. 2 %, and 7. 1 %, respectively. A significant association between 1 -octen- 3 -ol (per log 10 unit) and allergic rhinitis odds ratio (OR) : 4. 10, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 71 to 9. 80 and conjunctivitis (OR: 3. 54, CI: 1. 17 to 10. 7) was found after adjusting for age, sex, tobacco, wall-to-wall carpeting, signs of dampness, history of treatment for hay fever, and other potentially relevant environmental factors. No relationships were found between any MVOCs and asthma or atopic dermatitis after the adjustment. The levels of MVOCs and airborne fungi were only weakly correlated. These results are consistent with previous studies that have associated higher levels of 1 -octen- 3 -ol exposure with increased irritation of nasal and ocular mucosae. Although the indoor-air concentrations of 1 -octen- 3 -ol found in this study were relatively low, we conclude that exposure to MVOC may be related to rhinitis and conjunctivitis...|$|E
40|$|Micro-organisms {{are known}} to produce a range of {{volatile}} organic compounds, so-called microbial VOC (MVOC). Chamber studies where humans were exposed to MVOC addressed the acute effects of objective and/or subjective signs of mucosal irritation. However, the effect of MVOC on inhabitants due to household exposure is still unclear. The purpose of this epidemiological study was to measure indoor MVOC levels in single family homes and to evaluate the relationship between exposure to them and sick building syndrome (SBS). All inhabitants of the dwellings were <b>given</b> <b>a</b> <b>self-administered</b> <b>questionnaire</b> with standardized questions to assess their symptoms. Air samples were collected and the concentrations of eight selected compounds in indoor air were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry - selective ion monitoring mode (GC/MS-SIM). The most frequently detected MVOC was 1 -pentanol at a detection rate of 78. 6 % and geometric mean of 0. 60 μg/m 3. Among 620 participants, 120 (19. 4 %) reported one or more mucous symptoms; irritation of the eyes, nose, airway, or coughing every week (weekly symptoms), and 30 (4. 8 %) reported that the symptoms were home-related (home-related symptoms). Weekly symptoms were not associated with any of MVOC. whereas significant associations between home-related mucous symptoms and 1 -octen- 3 -ol (per log 10 -unit: odds ratio (OR) 5. 6, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 2. 1 to 14. 8) and 2 -pentanol (per log 10 -unit: OR 2. 3, 95 % CI: 1. 0 to 4. 9) were obtained after adjustment for gender, age, and smoking. Associations between home-related symptoms and 1 -octen- 3 -ol remained after mutual adjustment. However, concentrations of the selected compounds in indoors were lower than the estimated safety level in animal studies. Thus, the statistically significant association between 1 -octen- 3 -ol {{may be due to}} a direct effect of the compounds or the associations may be being associated with other offending compounds. Additional studies are needed to evaluate these possibilities...|$|E
