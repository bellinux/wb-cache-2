40|$|Defects in {{intracellular}} transport are {{implicated in}} the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). <b>Hook</b> proteins are a family of cytoplasmic linker proteins that participate in endosomal transport. In this study we show that <b>Hook</b> 1 and <b>Hook</b> 3 are expressed in neurons while <b>Hook</b> 2 is predominantly expressed in astrocytes. Furthermore, <b>Hook</b> proteins are associated with pathological hallmarks in AD; <b>Hook</b> 1 and <b>Hook</b> 3 are localized to tau aggregates and <b>Hook</b> 2 to glial components within amyloid plaques. Additionally, the expression of <b>Hook</b> 3 is reduced in AD. Modelling of <b>Hook</b> 3 deficiency in cultured cells leads to slowing of endosomal transport and increases β-amyloid production. We propose that <b>Hook</b> 3 {{plays a role in}} pathogenic events exacerbating AD...|$|R

5000|$|Adding {{a trailer}} <b>hook</b> or [...] "stinger" [...] <b>hook</b> (either a single or treble <b>hook)</b> behind the main spinnerbait <b>hook</b> {{is also a}} {{personal}} preference and may ensure a better hookup as well preventing fish that jump from throwing the bait. Some anglers prefer the single <b>hook</b> to be rigged so that the point is down, especially in open-water situations. Others prefer it rigged point-up. In either case the <b>hook</b> must be prevented from coming off the main <b>hook</b> or grabbing weeds. One way to accomplish this is to use rubber or silicone tubing cut to 1/8", inserting {{the eye of the}} trailer <b>hook</b> and forcing the main <b>hook</b> through the tube-covered eye. The trailer <b>hook</b> is now fixed stationary behind the main <b>hook.</b> Another way allows the <b>hook</b> more side to side motion and consists of stops above and below the eye placed on the main <b>hook.</b> These stops can be 1/8-inch cut silicone tubing or disks hole-punched from the plastic lid of a coffee can or wide rubber bands and placed above and below the trailer <b>hook</b> eye encircling the main <b>hook.</b>|$|R
