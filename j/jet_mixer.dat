This discussion will focus on mechanical agitators, jets, shrouded axial impeller mixers, spargers, and pulsed <b>jet</b> <b>mixers,</b> as these devices {{are most likely to}} be employed in Savannah River Site (SRS) Closure Business applications. In addressing mixing problems in the SRS Tank Farm, one must distinguish between different mixing objectives.

For example, one should not apply sludge mixing guidelines to heel removal applications. Mixing effectiveness is a function of both the mixing device (e. g., slurry pump, agitator, air sparger) and the properties of the material to be mixed (e. g., yield stress, viscosity, density, and particle size).

This report documents a thorough literature search for commercially available applicable mixing technologies {{that could be used}} for double-shell tank sludge mobilization and mixing. Textbooks, research articles, conference proceedings, mixing experts, and the Thomas Register were consulted to identify applicable technologies. While there are many commercial methods that could be used to mobilize sludge or mix the contents of a one-million gallon tank, few will work given the geometrical constraints (e. g., the mixer must fit through a 1. 07 -m-diameter riser) or the tank waste properties (e. g., the sludge has such a high yield stress that it generally does not flow under its own weight).

Simulations of several axial jet configurations for an Ares V scale EDS LH 2 tank during low Earth orbit (LEO) coast are evaluated and selected results are also presented. Data from jet mixing experiments performed in the 1960 s by General Dynamics with water at two tank sizes (1 and 10 ft diameter) are used to evaluate CFD accuracy.

40|$|International audienceThe {{flow field}} in a 2 D T-jets mixer was {{simulated}} {{to study the}} effect of the pulsation/modulation of the jets flow rate on the dynamics of mixing. Different strategies, frequencies and amplitudes of the opposed jets flow rate modulation were tested. The modulation frequencies were set as multiples of the natural oscillation frequencies of the dynamics flow field. The natural flow frequencies are determined from the unforced flow, i. e., when the jets are not modulated. It is found that out phase modulation of the opposed jets, with frequencies close to the natural frequencies, cause resonance of the flow enhancing the order of the system, which results in a flow field with a well-defined repetitive generation of vortices. Conversely, when the pulsation frequencies were different from the natural frequencies the flow disorder was enhanced, i. e., the vortices evolution throughout the T-jets mixers is less repetitive.

40|$|In {{this work}} a new {{approach}} for calculating the rate of formation of polymer nanoparticles in solvent-displacement precipitation processes is presented. The work is motivated {{by the fact that}} the standard expressions obtained from the classic nucleation theory seem not to be adequate to describe nucleation of particles primarily constituted by polymer molecules, due to the many approximations involved. A new expression for the nucleation rate is therefore derived and molecular dynamics simulations (carried out with Gromacs) are used to obtain all the missing parameters involved. This expression is then implemented together with the classical one into a population balance model that accounts for particle formation, molecular growth and aggregation. The population balance model is implemented in a computational fluid dynamics code (i. e. Fluent) and solved with the quadrature method of moments. Resulting in turbulent flow conditions, the model is treated with the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equation approach and coupled with a micromixing model (i. e. direct quadrature method of moments coupled with the interaction and exchange with the mean model.

40|$|As {{part of the}} River Protection Project at Hanford, Washington, Bechtel National, Inc. {{has been}} {{contracted}} by the United States Department of Energy to design a Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant to stabilize liquid radioactive waste. Because of its experience with radioactive waste stabilization, the Savannah River Technology Center of the Westinghouse Savannah River Company is working with Bechtel National and Washington Group International, to help design and test {{certain parts of the}} Waste Treatment Plant. One part of the process is the separation of radioactive isotopes from the liquid waste by a precipitation reaction and cross-flow ultrafiltration. To better understand those combined processes an experiment was performed using a simulated radioactive waste, made to prototypically represent the chemical and physical characteristics of a Hanford waste in tank 241 -AN- 102 and precipitated under prototypic conditions. The resultant slurry was then filtered using a cross-flow filter prototypic in porosity, length, and diameter to the plant design. An important aspect of filtration for waste treatment is the rate at which permeate is produced. There are many factors that affect filtration rate {{and one of the most}} difficult to obtain is the effect of particles in the waste streams. The Waste Treatment Plant will filter many waste streams, with varying concentrations and types of dissolved and undissolved solids. An added complication is the need to precipitate organic complexants so they can be efficiently separated from the supernatant. Depending on how precipitation is performed, the newly created solids will add to the complicating factors that determine permeate flux rate. To investigate the effect of precipitated solids on filter flux a pilot-scale test was performed and two different mixing mechanisms were used for the precipitation reaction. A standard impeller type mixer, which created a homogeneous mixture, and a pulse <b>jet</b> <b>mixer,</b> which created a ''less than'' homogeneous precipitation environment. Pulse jet mixers are included in the design of the Waste Treatment Plant because they have no moving parts, which is advantageous for radioactive operations as no maintenance is required. A pulse <b>jet</b> <b>mixer</b> uses alternate pulses of pressurized air and vacuum to mix tank contents. This pulse <b>jet</b> <b>mixer</b> was not expected to establish a homogeneous mixture throughout the test tank, therefore, it was important to know its effect on filtration after a waste is precipitated. This paper discusses the experimental results of cross-flow filter flux after a simulated waste is precipitated under each of the two mixing methods. The main conclusion reached is that while the ''less than well mixed'' jet-pulsed waste gave a lower average filter flux it may still be sufficiently large enough to meet plant requirements...|$|E
40|$|The {{attached}} document defines the preliminary design {{criteria for a}} heel management system. The design criteria establish perfonnance capabilities for heel dilution, heel pump-out, and use ofthe access ports associated with the heel management system. This document updates requirements to include specific solids removal objectives relevant to particle size/density and across the range ofinitial waste rheology conditions that will exist in pulse <b>jet</b> <b>mixer</b> mixed vessels. Specific testing perfonnance ranges will be contained in Test Specifications for tests assessing heel management system perfonnance capability. Heel management perfonnance test objectives implemented in test planning documentation (including Test Specifications and Test Plans) will be documented in Requests for Technology Development. Tests to defme limits ofheel management system capability will consider input from the following documents...|$|E
40|$|Poiseuille flow {{combined}} with rapid mixing provides a low pressure drop method of continuous seed production. Magnitude and variance of distribution width and volume median diameter (D[50]) measured in line (IL) increase with initial saturation index (SI), whereas filtered and re-suspended samples show little change. These effects are greater for the impinging <b>jet</b> (IJ) <b>mixer</b> than the Roughton (R) mixer. This illustrates that incomplete mixing before nucleation promotes formation of unstable aggregates, {{creating a more}} variable product. The IJ mixer also produced a lower phosphorus recovery, which {{may be attributed to}} SI gradients caused by incomplete mixing. Differences in mass recovery measurements indicate that scaling is an issue and needs to be further investigated...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of River Protection’s Waste Treatment Plant (WTP) will {{process and}} treat {{radioactive}} waste that {{is stored in}} tanks at the Hanford Site. The waste treatment process in the pretreatment facility will mix both Newtonian and non-Newtonian slurries in large process tanks. Process vessels mixing non-Newtonian slurries will use pulse <b>jet</b> <b>mixers</b> (PJMs), air sparging, and recirculation pumps. An anti-foam agent (AFA) {{will be added to}} the process streams to prevent surface foaming, but may also increase gas holdup and retention within the slurry. The work described in this report addresses gas retention and release in simulants with AFA through testing and analytical studies. Gas holdup and release tests were conducted in a 1 / 4 -scale replica of the lag storage vessel operated in the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) Applied Process Engineering Laboratory using a kaolin/bentonite clay and AZ- 101 HLW chemical simulant with non-Newtonian rheological properties representative of actual waste slurries. Additional tests were performed in a small-scale mixing vessel in the PNNL Physical Sciences Building using liquids and slurries representing major components of typical WTP waste streams. Analytical studies were directed at discovering how the effect of AFA might depend on gas composition and predicting the effect of AFA on gas retention and release in the full-scale plant, including the effects of mass transfer to the sparge air. The work at PNNL {{was part of a larger}} program that included tests conducted at Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) that is being reported separately. SRNL conducted gas holdup tests in a small-scale mixing vessel using the AZ- 101 high-level waste (HLW) chemical simulant to investigate the effects of different AFAs, their components, and of adding noble metals. Full-scale, single-sparger mass transfer tests were also conducted at SRNL in water and AZ- 101 HLW simulant to provide data for PNNL’s WTP gas retention and release modeling...|$|R
40|$|The Hanford Tank Operations Contractor (TOC) and the Hanford Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) {{contractor}} {{are both}} engaged in demonstrating mixing, sampling, and transfer system capability using simulated Hanford High-Level Waste (HLW) formulations. This work {{represents one of}} the remaining technical issues with the high-level waste treatment mission at Hanford. The TOCs� ability to adequately mix and sample high-level waste feed to meet the WTP WAC Data Quality Objectives must be demonstrated. The tank mixing and feed delivery must support both TOC and WTP operations. The tank mixing method must be able to remove settled solids from the tank and provide consistent feed to the WTP to facilitate waste treatment operations. Two geometrically scaled tanks were used with a broad spectrum of tank waste simulants to demonstrate that mixing using two rotating <b>mixer</b> <b>jet</b> pumps yields consistent slurry compositions as the tank is emptied in a series of sequential batch transfers. Testing showed that the concentration of slow settling solids in each transfer batch was consistent over a wide range of tank operating conditions. Although testing demonstrated that the concentration of fast settling solids decreased by up to 25 % as the tank was emptied, batch-to-batch consistency improved as <b>mixer</b> <b>jet</b> nozzle velocity in the scaled tanks increased...|$|R
