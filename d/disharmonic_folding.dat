50|$|Two {{different}} types of folding may occur at a décollement. Concentric folding is identified by uniform bed thickness throughout the fold, and is necessarily accompanied by detachment or a décollement {{as part of the}} deformation that occurs with a thrust fault. <b>Disharmonic</b> <b>folding</b> does not have uniform bed thickness throughout the fold.|$|E

During the Miocene this area became a depocentre in which locally thick Gachsaran salt was deposited. The presence of locally thick Gachsaran salt has caused <b>disharmonic</b> <b>folding</b> between the sequences above and below that layer.|$|E
5000|$|By {{incorporating}} elementary fold geometries {{under the}} term <b>disharmonic</b> <b>fold</b> detachment folds may then be classified {{into one of}} two categories; <b>disharmonic</b> <b>folds</b> or lift-off <b>folds.</b> <b>Disharmonic</b> <b>folds,</b> figure 3, are defined as detachment folds characterized by parallel geometries at the outer limbs and non-parallel interlimb geometries at stratigraphically distinct and lower units; caused by differential strain {{as a result of}} strain dissipation or change in mechanical stratigraphy, where the termination of folding typically results in a detachment. [...] Lift-off detachment folds are characterized by isoclinal folding in all units, with a tight isoclinal folded weak unit in the anticline and parallel geometries sometimes existing along the outer units. [...] Present day examples detachment folding {{can be found in the}} Jura Mountains of Central Europe. This region compliments the idea of detachment fold evolution put forth by Mitra in that it encompasses many of the basic fold geometries and comprises both disharmonic and lift-off geometries.|$|R

40|$|Foy Ridge {{is located}} about twenty-six miles {{south-southwest}} of Tucson, Arizona, {{and about a}} mile north of the Twin Buttes mining district. The sediments of the Roy Ridge area {{range in age from}} Cambrian to Recent. Separation of the Paleozoic section into mappable units has been complicated by post-Permian metamorphism. This metamorphism has destroyed any fossils that were probably once present, although a few remains of a Devonian Cladopora reef have been recognized. The metamorphism has caused a recrystallization of the limestones and an alteration of the shales to hornfels with stringers of epidote. The result is a sequence of altered Paleozoic rocks closely resembling one another. Lateral compression acting in a northeast-southwest direction played the major role in the tectonic history of the Foy Ridge area. Foy Ridge is the inverted limb of a large fold overturned to the northeast. As the fold was being produced thrust faults and wrench faults formed in the limbs. These first faults were cut off by the Foy Ridge fault that formed in the southwest limb of a northwest plunging anticline. This anticline was thrust forward (southwest) and upward until it was pressed against the inverted limb (Foy Ridge) and the adjacent <b>fold.</b> A <b>disharmonic</b> <b>fold</b> probably formed in the normal limb of the major fold of which Foy Ridge is a part. Thrust faults in the <b>disharmonic</b> <b>fold</b> repeated the lower Paleozoic section on the southwest side of Foy Ridge. As compression continued the last major thrust of the area was produced. This was the Bolsa Overthrust, which probably originated in the core of the <b>disharmonic</b> <b>fold.</b> It cut across the inverted limb of the major fold and may have also cut across the crest of the northwest plunging anticline northeast of the Foy Ridge fault. Intrusive activity followed or accompanied the overthrusting and folding of the area. This was closely followed by post-intrusion normal faulting. The Twin Buttes, two prominent hills immediately east of the thesis area, are a southeastern extension of the northeastern limb of the northwest plunging anticline that formed the hanging wall of the Foy Ridge fault. The "breached anticline" of the Twin Buttes mining district is probably related to the normal limb of the fold that formed Foy Ridge. The synclinal area between these two folds is covered by alluvium...|$|R
50|$|The Lorestan (or Lurestan) domain {{forms the}} northerly {{of the two}} main salients in the Zagros FTB. The {{structural}} style of the simply folded zone is interpreted here {{to be dominated by}} detachment folding with some degree of <b>disharmonic</b> <b>folding</b> (folding of differing wavelengths at different structural levels). The disharmony occurs between a deeper layer bounded by the basal and Dashtak Formation décollement levels and shallower one between the Dashtak décollement and the surface. There is also evidence of a thick-skinned element to the deformation. The lack of Hormuz salt exposed at the surface makes the nature of the basal detachment less certain than in the Fars domain, but the presence of this salt layer is inferred from the observation that the taper angle (the angle between the basal detachment and the current topographic slope) is identical to that where the salt is proven further south.|$|E
5000|$|Further {{compression}} {{dominated by}} hinge migration, yields tightening of folds and space accommodation issues within the anticlinal core; {{leading to the}} formation of disharmonic folds [...] [...] Epard and Groshong, (1994) recognize a similar pattern to <b>disharmonic</b> <b>folding</b> they label it second-order shortening. [...] Basic models and experiments [...] as well as concentric fold models fail to recognize disharmonic folds as they focus on single layer detachment folding, lack the resolution in experimental methods or, though the assumption of multiple units is made, restrict unit parameters which may cause disharmony through deformation. Continued shortening and excess material within the anticlinal core not only results in increased amplitude and disharmonic folds, but may lead to the onset of thrusts out of the folded synclinal or anticlinal regions. Through further deformation by limb rotation and through hinge migration, isoclinal folds eventually assume lift-off geometries. Thrust faults in the synclinal fold, if any formed, may also be rotated to assist in the formation of detached lift-off folds upon further tightening and rotation (figure 4).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Glass {{microbeads}} {{are frequently}} used in analog physical modeling to simulate weak detachment zones {{but have been}} neglected in models of thrust wedges. Microbeads differ from quartz sand in grain shape and in low angle of internal friction. In this study, we compared the structural characteristics of microbeads and sand wedges. To obtain a better picture of their mechanical behavior, we determined the physical and frictional properties of microbeads using polarizing and scanning electron microscopy and ring-shear tests, respectively. We built shortening experiments with different basal frictions and measured the thickness, slope and length of the wedges and also the fault spacings. All the microbeads experiments revealed wedge geometries that were consistent with previous {{studies that have been}} performed with sand. However, the deformation features in the microbeads shortened over low to intermediate basal frictions were slightly different. Microbeads produced different fault geometries than sand as well as a different grain flow. In addition, they produced slip on minor faults, which was associated with distributed deformation and gave the microbeads wedges the appearance of <b>disharmonic</b> <b>folds.</b> We concluded that the glass microbeads may be used to simulate relatively competent rocks, like carbonates, which may be characterized by small-scale deformation features...|$|R
40|$|The main {{scientific}} {{goal with}} this thesis is {{to study the}} configuration of the main Caledonian geological structures within the Lower Silurian succession, with emphasis on back-thrusts at Sundvollen, Ringerike in southern Norway. This involves determination of the relationship between main- and subsidiary thrusts and folding in context {{to the development of the}} Ringerike area. Four separate deformational phases connected to the study area are identified based on analysis of the structural geological data. Phase 1 represents the oldest structures, whilst phase 4 represents the youngest. Thrust faults and folds connected to deformational phase 1 are associated with bedding-parallel shortening. The development of tight- to isoclinal, <b>disharmonic</b> <b>folds</b> with upright axial planes is defined as deformational phase 2. Structures connected to deformational phase 3 are foreland-directed thrust faults and large, open and upright folds with wavelengths in the order of hundreds of meters. The orientation of the maximum stress axes indicated by structures associated to phase 1 are generally consistent with what is known for the regional transport in the Oslo Region. The transport directions displayed by the structures comprising phases 2 and 3 are consistent with the main SSE-directed tectonic transport direction displayed in the Oslo Region (e. g Gabrielsen and Larsen in press). Deformational phase 4 comprises back-thrusts. Structures connected to this phase are low-angle thrust faults and fault-propagation-folds. The transport direction of the faults shifts gradually from N-NNW in the southern part of the study area to WNW-NW in the northernmost part. The generally gentle deformational style, characterized by large open folds as displayed in the study area, is consistent with the general structural style in the upper Cambro-Silurian succession in the Oslo Region (Morley 1987 a). Back-thrusts are however the most dominant of the exposed thrust faults in the study area. All structures are situated in the Lower Silurian succession at Ringerike. Therefore are phases 1 - 4 formed in response to the Scandian phase, which corresponds to the main Caledonian deformation (e. g Roberts 2003) ...|$|R

40|$|The Tertiary compressional {{structure}} of the northern sector of the Almazan basin is defined by several E-W to NW-SE trending folds. These folds extend from the northern and eastern basin borders to the central part.

40|$|Small scale folds that deform the chert rich horizons in {{siliceous}} facies of the Monterey Formation, in Santa Maria Basin, at Lions Head, California are of tectonic origin. Folding is {{well developed}} in the chert-dominated horizons and dies out a short distance into the adjacent siliceous mudstones. This style {{has been attributed to}} gravity-driven, penecontemporaneous folding, but a tectonic origin is evidenced by the dominantly brittle deformation of the competent chert layers. Mechanically, the folds formed through complex interaction between fracture and flexural- slip and flexural-flow. Opal-CT and quartz beds display brittle fractures and rotated fracture blocks that responded to early shortening. Variable fold styles, typical of <b>disharmonic</b> <b>folding,</b> are displayed in association with well developed slip surfaces. Dilation breccia and void space occur in the hinges and reflect volumetric problems developed during fold propagation. Layer parallel shortening, manifested as thickening and pressure solution, dominated the deformation in the mudstone horizons. After a period of initial shortening, the entire Monterey section began to fold. The highly layered, fractured, chert horizons acted partially as slip zones during the development of the large scale flexural-slip folds. continued folding in the chert horizons generated the variable fold styles that tend to have a consistent vergence. Subsequent diagenesis has partially healed the fractures and slip surfaces, creating the appearance that the chert beds deformed as a ductile medium during folding...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, two push moraine systems {{associated}} with two small subpolar glaciers, Finsterwalderbreen and Penckbreen, were investigated. This {{study showed that}} at these glaciers the push moraines were formed in association with surges, which produced a different style of moraine depending on the rheology of the deformed material and the glacial history. The moraines are similar {{in that they are}} formed by folded outwash sediments and contain little till. However, the forms of these moraines are very different. The Penckbreen moraine is composed of a lower shallow marine sand, silt and clay, and an upper fluvial sand and gravel. Deformation at this site {{led to the formation of}} large anticlines in the silts and clays, with <b>disharmonic</b> smaller <b>folds</b> and thrusts in the upper gravels, above a detachment surface between the fine-grained and overlying coarse-grained lithologies. This deformation decreases towards the foreland, with marine and fluvial sediments responding differently because of their different rheological properties. This moraine was formed during one surge event which occured during the early 19 th century. In contrast, the Finsterwalderbreen moraine is composed of outwash sand and gravel, and was formed as the result of a series of surge events.

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 The Gandghar Range and Kherimar Hills, {{located in}} the Hill Ranges of {{northern}} Pakistan, contain rocks that are transitional between unmetarnorphosed foreland-basin strata {{to the south and}} high-grade metamorphic and plutonic rocks to the north. The southern Gandghar Range is composed of a succession of marine strata of probable Proterozoic age, consisting of a thick basal argillaceous sequence (Manki Formation) overlain by algal limestone and shale (Shahkot, Utch Khattak, and Shekhai formations). These strata are intruded by diabase dikes and sills that may correlate with the Panjal Volcanics. Southern Gandghar Range strata occur in two structural blocks juxtaposed along the Baghdarra fault. The hanging wall consists entirely of isoclinally-folded Manki Formation, whereas the footwall consists of the complete Manki-Shekhai succession which has been deformed into tight, northeast-plunging, generally southeast (foreland) verging <b>disharmonic</b> <b>folds.</b> Phyllite near the Baghdarra fault displays kink bands, a poorly-developed S-C fabric, and asymmetric deformation of foliation around garnet porphyroblasts. These features are consistent with conditions of dextral shear, indicating reverse-slip displacement along the fault. South of the Gandghar Range, the Panjal fault brings the Gandghar Range succession over the Kherimar Hills succession, which is composed of a basal Precambrian arenaceous sequence (Hazara Formation) unconformably overlain by Jurassic limestone (Samana Suk Formation) which in turn is unconformably overlain by Paleogene marine strata (Lockhart Limestone and Patala Formation). The Hazara and Manki formations, considered to be stratigraphically equivalent, show an increase in metamorphic grade to the north. In the Kherimar Hills, the Hazara Formation is unmetamorphosed, whereas in the Gandghar Range, the Manki Formation is metamorphosed to the greenschist-lower epidote-amphibolite grade. Younger strata in both areas show little to no evidence of metamorphism. The Gandghar Range succession is identical to the succession in the hanging wall of the Khairabad fault in the Attock-Cherat Range, and the Kherimar Hills succession resembles the succession in the footwall of the Khairabad fault. These relationships indicate that the Panjal and Khairabad faults are continuous and juxtapose two major, laterally continuous structural blocks. South of the Kherimar Hills, the Nathia Gali fault brings the Kherimar Hills succession, in which rocks as old as Precambrian are exposed, over the Margala Hills succession, in which the oldest rocks exposed are Mesozoic. To the west, the Cherat and Hissartang faults are considered to be bifurcations of the Nathia Gall fault. The Paleocene Lockhart Limestone is common to the stratigraphic successions {{on both sides of the}} Hissartang, Cherat, and Nathia Gali faults. Pre-Paleocene successions differ across the Hissartang and Cherat faults, indicating large amounts of displacement and juxtaposition of the successions in Late Cretaceous time. Pre-Paleocene successions juxtaposed along the Nathia Gali fault indicate that most of the displacement along the fault occurred prior to deposition of the Jurassic Samana Suk Formation. Tertiaty faulting has occurred on the Hissartang, Cherat, and Nathia Gali faults, although this displacement is small relative to the pre-Paleocene displacement. Pre-Paleocene displacement along the Khairabad-Panjal fault cannot be demonstrated due to the absence of Tertiary strata to the north. The Hill Ranges fault system, composed of the Main Boundary thrust and Murree, Nathia Gall, Cherat, Hissartang, Khairabad, Panjal, and Baghdarra faults, forms a hinterland-dipping duplex. The estimated minimum total horizontal separation on the Hill Ranges fault system is 85 km. based on the restoration of projected Paleozoic hanging-wall and footwall cutoffs on a balanced cross section. Crystalline basement is not involved in the Hill Ranges fault system. The sedimentary cover is decoupled from the basement along a detachment that corresponds to the Salt Range thrust...|$|R
40|$|The {{pre-drilling}} {{prediction of}} (paleo) -stress helps defining fracture and fault patterns which can either help or hinder hydrocarbon production, {{and helps to}} decipher the tectonic history of the crust. At the moment, paleostress studies are mostly based on the detailed mapping of faults and movement directions in the field. This limits the applicability of this approach to areas where the rocks of interest are outcropping and excludes sedimentary basins. In this work, a method is developed and tested to determine the paleostress stratigraphy solely based on 3 D reflection data, and the initial work for a similar approach for ductile evaporites is presented. For the determination of paleostress, knowledge of the orientation and slip direction of the individual faults in the set is required. Both in field and seismic surveys it {{is relatively easy to}} determine the fault orientation. Determining the slip direction however remains a challenge in seismic data. In field studies, measurement of the slickenside orientation provides a quick and easy slip direction determination, but these structures are too small to be resolved in seismic data. Due to the converging pattern of slip lines, the measured slickenline does not need to represent the tectonic movement direction. Furthermore, since faults generally rupture in a number of seismic events distributed over the fault plane, contradicting slip directions formed during the same tectonic phase can overprint each other, complicating the interpretation of field based slip determination. The easiest way to determine the slip direction on faults is by connecting two points that were on direct opposite sides of the fault, prior to deformation. Unfortunately, no faulted channels or lineaments were present in the data set. By careful mapping of the Allan lines however, the slip directions of a number of faults, over a number of time periods were constrained. This data allowed for the determination of the paleostress stratigraphy of the NW corner of the Groningen High in the Netherlands, spanning from the Triassic to present-day. The paleostress states correspond well with published paleostress data. The roughness of fault planes is however not limited to the scale of slickensides. Also larger undulations are present on the fault surfaces. Recent publications, based on LiDAR measurements of outcropping faults suggest that these undulations are in the direction of fault slip. Detailed interpretation of several faults in the relatively brittle Upper Cretaceous Chalk from the same area showed that in reflection seismic, undulations are present in interpretations in different directions. It is also shown that these undulations are unlikely {{to be the result of}} aliasing, or interpolation effects. The determination of the orientation and slip direction of over 200 faults allowed the determination of the Upper Cretaceous paleostress. This result corresponds well to the paleostress results with the geometrically determined slip direction, and published results. The Late Permian Zechstein deposits of Europe consist for a large part of (ductile) evaporites. This interval decouples sub- and supra-salt deformation. The ductile deformation of these deposits does not allow the determination of the paleostress evolution using the above discussed method. However, an enclosed brittle layer, fully encased in the ductile salts, allows the visualization of the extremely complex deformation patterns, and can serve as a strain marker in these deposits. Structures observed, include various types of <b>disharmonic</b> <b>folds,</b> superimposed on the harmonic folding, which follows the top of the salt, ductile rupture (boudins) and zones of early diagentic/sedimentary thickness increase. The latter seem to affect younger deformation. These zones seem to influence the location of salt structures, showing that early structures can affect the salt tectonics and deformation of supra-salt deposits...|$|R
40|$|The Texas Orocline, {{with a half}} {{wavelength}} of similar to 120 km, is {{the largest and most}} obvious orocline in the southern New England Orogen and is clearly recognised in geological maps and geophysical images. In the area of the orocline, there is a major unconformity between Devonian-Carboniferous metasedimentary rocks (Texas beds) and the overlying Early Permian rift-related basins. Detailed structural mapping shows that units both above and below the unconformity are folded around the orocline, indicating that {{at least part of the}} oroclinal deformation has occurred after the deposition of the Early Permian rocks. In addition, Early Permian (298290 Ma) granitoids are aligned parallel to the oroclinal structure, further indicating that deformation partly occurred during or after the Early Permian. Pre-oroclinal isoclinal folds (F- 1) and related axial plane cleavage (Si) are well developed in the Texas beds and are curved around the oroclinal structure. Syn-oroclinal structures are characterised by minor kink folds and <b>disharmonic</b> <b>folding</b> (F- 2) in the core of the orocline. A later phase of kink folding corresponding to a similar to N-S shortening direction does not seem to be related to the orocline, and is interpreted as post-oroclinal deformation.

40|$|The {{results of}} an {{investigation}} of the structure and sedimentology of Upper Westphalian and Lower Stephanian strata in the eastern end of the Cantabrian palaeozoic core (NW Spain), are presented. The sediments, shales, sandstones, limestones and coal seams occur in three main associations: the orthoquartzite-carbonate, the turbidite and paralic associations. Two facies are dstinguished: a western, without turbidites, with relatively many coal seams and an eastern, with turbidites and a few coal seams. Some evidence for a zone of less subsidence is present. This zone separates the two facies. The western and eastern facies are represented by the rocks in the Sierra Corisa and Redondo synclines respectively. Between the two synclines occurs a zone of long stretched narrow folds, often upthrusted to the west. Fold axes generally plunge SSE. Some of the structural features are explained by <b>disharmonic</b> <b>folding</b> and extrusion tectonics. In the eastern facies a formation occurs, which consists of graded sandstones alternating with mudstones. Thickness measurements of the individual sandstone and mudstone beds are analysed with non-parametric statistical methods. Several regularities in the succession of lithological types or thicknesses are revealed. Correlations between thickness or position of variates (i. e. sandstone, mudstone, sideritic concretion) are tentatively explained {{in the light of the}} turbidity current hypothesis. Especially the successive sandstone thicknesses show an interdependence expressed in “fluctuations”. Sandstone-mudstone thickness-correlation leads to the assumption of a very high mud content of the turbidity current in these cases, and considerable erosion by successive currents. Sedimentary structures, especially those of the turbidite association, are described in detail. A short annotated bibliography on sole markings is given. The palaeocurrent directions measured from sole markings and cross-bedding are discussed. The sequence of sole-marking-directions on successive turbidite layers indicates interdependence of these dirctions, which could also mean the interdependence of the depositing currents.

Cabitza Formation Calcescisti Member Iglesiente Group Metallifero Formation Calcare Member Arenarie Formation (base not seen) Dolomia Member It {{is possible to}} distinguish Cambrian from Ordovician slates even where the basal conglomerate of the latter fails. As a consequence part of the official geological map (scale 1 : 100000, 1938) had to be revised. The Cambrian and the Ordovician-Silurian rocks have undergone respectively four and three deformation phases {{with the development of}} slaty, fracture and crenulation cleavages. The large E-W folds of the Cambrian Sardic-phase are partly concentric (Arenarie and Metallifero rocks) and partly similar (slaty cleavage in the Cabitza slates). The second phase, also E-W, caused a further tightening of the ”Sardic” structures and folded the Ordovician and Silurian rocks. The third deformation phase (N-S) was the Hercynian mainfolding, accompanied by fracture and crenulation cleavage. The fourth and last Hercynian phase (NW-SE and NE-SW) made a conjugate system of folds and cleavages. A specific structural pattern (domes, basins etc.) followed from the interference of these fold systems (”Schlingenbau”). Most folds are disharmonie as a result of differences in rock competencies of the Cambrian Formations. The Cambro-Ordovician unconformity has been partly obliterated by slip (”decollement”) due to <b>disharmonic</b> <b>folding</b> above and below this plane. Limestones have been partly converted into lime-silicate rocks by Hercynian hydrothermal and pneumatolytical action along irregular zones and an interesting skarn mineral paragenesis developed.

However, also N-verging asymmetrical folds are present. In the northern part of the Crozon peninsula, the Pointe des Capucins – Ancien Fort de la Fraternité cross-section also exposes the Plougastel Formation. Darboux & Plusquellec (1981) describe large-scale, open, symmetric folds and centimetre to multimetre-scale, SE-verging, asymmetrical folds in this section.

40|$|Three {{important}} folding phases, F 1, F 2 and F 3, {{have been}} found in the Pennine Nappes and the nappe-separating Palaeozoic and Mesozoic rocks between Saas Fee and Villadossola. The F 1 folds were formed {{at the beginning of the}} temperature increase that marks the second Alpine metamorphic event, and they resulted from penetrative deformation of the nappes and the nappe-separating rocks during the final stage of nappe emplacement. This stage was preceded by a stage of non-penetrative deformation during which most of the nappe transport is believed to have taken place. This earlier stage was characterized by thrusting along the interfaces between undeformed slabs of Hercynian or older crystalline basement rocks, and in the zones of nappe-separating rocks. In this study, the structural and metamorphic history after the beginning of F 1 will be chiefly considered, and a reconstruction of the structural geology before F 2 will be made. Nearly all the F 1 folds outside the Moncucco zone have the same asymmetry, which reflects penetrative directional movement during the last stage of nappe emplacement. The axial directions of the F 1 folds, which are tight to rootless intrafolial folds of the layering, initially were not everywhere parallel. The folds occur on a microscopic and mesoscopic scale and have a pervasive axial-plane schistosity, S 1, which is the regionally prevalent S-plane. F 1 folding may have taken place at about 60 - 65 m. y. before present. The F 2 folds postdate the nappe movements; they have refolded the nappe boundaries and the structures of F 1 age. The relationships between plagioclase porphyroblastesis, F 2 deformation and the time-temperature curve for the second Alpine metamorphic event show that F 2 folding took place at about 36 m. y. before present. The similar-style F 2 folds, that occur on every scale, are characteristically disharmonie and sometimes extremely so. A common type of <b>disharmonic</b> <b>fold</b> has limbs which are convex towards the axial plane, the outer layers having been more tightly folded than the core, and some major folds also have this geometry. Many of the F 2 folds have an S 2 axial-plane schistosity that in the majority of cases was formed by reorientation of pre-existing micas. It is found that the degree of reorientation depends on the lithology, on the fold geometry, and probably also on other factors. All the major folds except one have F 2 age, and evidence for intensive F 2 deformation can be found almost anywhere. Well-known structures like the ‘Synclinale rétrograde de Saas’ and the Antrona Syncline were formed at this time. It is believed that the Antrona Syncline continues through the Monte Rosa Nappe to Mattmark, where it meets another major F 2 fold (the Trifthorn Antiform) and both folds terminate. The age and characteristics of F 2 folding in the Moncucco zone differ from the remainder of the area. This and the fact that the lithology of the Moncucco zone and the style of F 1 folding there also differ, suggests that the Moncucco zone may not be a part of the Pennine Nappes. The F 3 folds postdate all mineral growth, and one major fold, the Brevettola Antiform, was formed during this phase. It is the hinge between the ‘root-zone’ of the nappes and the nappes themselves, and the overturning of the ‘root-zone’ is therefore the result of F 3 folding. The Brevettola Antiform is believed to be the continuation in the Camughera-Moncucco Complex of the Vanzone Antiform. All other F 3 folds occur on a microscopic to mesoscopic scale; they can be separated in two contemporaneous sets of folds with opposite asymmetry and opposed axial-plane dip directions...|$|R
40|$|The Johnnie district, in {{the northwestern}} Spring Mountains, Nye County, Nevada, may have {{produced}} a little under 100, 000 troy oz of gold, since {{the discovery of the}} district in 1890. An approximately 13, 000 -ft-thick (4, 000 m) section of east-dipping upper Precambrian through Middle Cambrian miogeosynclinal clastic and carbonate rocks is exposed in the district. The strata are, in order of decreasing age, the Johnnie Formation, Stirling Quartzite, Wood Canyon Formation, Zabriskie Quartzite, and Carrara and Bonanza King Formations. These are overlain by Cenozoic units which include and older unit and a younger unit of fanglomerate, the older containing a megabreccia deposit, and Quaternary alluvium. The rocks were deformed by the Late Cretaceous Sevier orogeny and by subsequent tectonic events, which include Basin-and-Range faulting, of Miocene age. The oldest structures, formed in conjunction with Sevier tectonism, are <b>disharmonic</b> <b>folds</b> in the Johnnie Formation, which folds underwent rotation by later (Sevier orogeny) eastward tilting of the district during larger scale folding. Simultaneously with the later folding, competent rocks were translated across less competent ones along zones of tectonic readjustment; the most notable zone {{is at the top of}} the Johnnie Formation in the western part of the district. High-angle fractures [...] in extension, conjugate, and pressure-release orientations [...] developed at about the same time and were the ancestors for most younger high-angle structures, including quartz veins. Longitudinal faulting occurred at the end of the Sevier orogeny; and concurrently, the related Congress low-angle normal fault developed. The district was dropped down to the west along the Grapevine fault system during Basin-and-Range normal faulting at the west face of the Spring Mountains. Throughout the structural development of the district, displacement occurred along transverse faults in secondary readjustment to displacement along other features and also low-angle faults transposed younger rocks across older ones. Some of the tectonism caused local carbonatization of the Bonanza King Formation. The district was eroded in a series of stages during Basin-and-Range faulting. finally, sometime between latest Miocene to middle Pleistocene times, pediments developed at the edges of the resultant basins, then were buried by bajadas of older fanglomerate. Later, parts of the pediments were exhumed by erosion. High-angle and concordant quartz-bearing structures were emplaced during hydrothermal activity, probably between the Paleocene and early Miocene epochs. High-angle quartz veins, the average of which strikes ENE and dips north, dominate and are the hosts for most economic, mesothermal mineralization in the district. Three ore mineralogic suites are present: gold-chalcopyrite-pyrite, chalcopyrite-galena, and galena (-calcite). Additionally, chalcopyrite occurs with specularite in stratabound quartz-poor lodes of apparent hydrothermal origin; these oxidize to low-grade malachite deposits. Placer gold deposits formed in the older fanglomerate during post Basin-and-Range faulting erosion of the district. The characteristic wall-rock alteration mineralogic suites in the hypogene deposits are sericite and pyrite in clastic rocks and also sericite, alone, in dolomite; the alteration minerals, chlorite, calcite, and specularite, occur locally. The ore mineralogic suites define a district-wide pattern of hypogene mineralogic zonation about gold centers at the Johnnie and Congress mines, the main producers in the district. The fundamental control which admitted the hydrothermal fluids into the district is obscure. However, trains of quartz veins are concentrated within 2. 5 -mi-long (4 km), ENE-trending principal mineralized structures which lie astride an inferred 13 -mi-long (21 km) N. - 35 o-E. -trending major longitudinal structure, which may be a manifestation of the fundamental control. The gold mineralization is localized in the Zabriskie Quartzite and the dolomitic rocks near the top of the Wood Canyon Formation, in part, by the retention of hydrothermal fluids beneath a blanket of shaly rocks at the base of the Carrara Formation. The base of the dolomitic rocks is also the base of the Cambrian section, which is recognized as a favorable stratigraphic site for ore deposition at other places in the southern Great Basin. Although this report develops a theme in which the hydrothermal fluids were introduced from a remote source below the district, as the broad concepts of ore genesis change with time, it may become accepted that many of the constituents of the hydrothermal fluid were derived from local, syngenetic sources...|$|R

Published: 1999 Modes of debris entrainment and subsequent transfer in seven 'normal' and five surge-type glaciers in Svalbard (76 - 79 degrees N) are {{outlined in the}} context of the structural evolution of a glacier as the ice deforms during flow Three main modes of entrainment and transfer are inferred from structural and sedimentological observations: (i) The incorporation of angular rockfall material within the stratified sequence of snow/firn/superimposed ice. This debris takes an englacial path through the glacier; becoming folded. At the margins and at the boundaries of flow units the stratified ice including debris is strongly folded, so that near the snout the debris emerges at the surface on the hinges and limbs of the folds, producing medial moraines which merge towards the snout. The resulting lines of debris are transmitted to the proglacial area in the form of regular trains of angular debris. (ii) Incorporation of debris of both supraglacial and basal character within longitudinal foliation. This is particularly evident at the surface of the glacier at the margins or at flow unit boundaries. It can be sometimes demonstrated that foliation is a product of strong folding, since it usually has an axial planar relationship with folded stratification. Foliation-parallel debris thus represents a more advanced stage of deformation than in (i). Although the presence of basal debris is problematic, it is proposed that this material is tightly folded ice derived from the bed in the manner of <b>disharmonic</b> <b>folding.</b> The readily deformed subglacial sediment or bedrock surface represents the plane of decollement. (iii) Thrusting, whereby debris-rich basal ice (including regelation ice) and subglacial sediments are uplifted into an englacial position, sometimes emerging at the ice surface. This material is much more variable in character than that derived from rockfalls, and reflects the substrate lithologies; diamicton with striated clasts and sandy gravels are the most common facies represented. Thrusting is a dynamic process, and in polythermal glaciers is probably linked mainly to the transition from sliding to frozen bed conditions. It is not therefore a solely ice-marginal or proglacial process. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1988 Approximately 1600 km of seismic {{reflection}} profiles {{from the}} eastern Salt Range and Potwar Plateau (SR/PP) of Pakistan are integrated with available magnetostratigraphic, surface geologic and well data, to categorize structural styles, determine the timing of deformation and estimate the amount of telescoping of the sedimentary cover. The eastern SR/PP is similar to other fold-and-thrust belts underlain by evaporites in that: 1) {{it is part of}} a zone of overthrusting that extends considerably farther over the Himalyan foreland than adjacent areas not underlain by evaporites; 2) the overall thrust wedge has a narrow cross-sectional taper; 3) structures verge toward the hinterland as well as toward the foreland; and, 4) fold trends are long and continuous, consisting of tight, salt-cored anticlines separated by broad synclines. <b>Disharmonic</b> <b>folding</b> of the sedimentary section relative to the underlying basement is due to effective decoupling along the intervening salt layer. Subsurface mapping on top of a strongly reflective package of Cambrian to Eocene strata reveals that many surface folds are cored by both foreland- and hinterland-dipping, blind thrusts, and some are fault propagation folds. In some cases, intersecting thrusts result in local triangle zones; other surface folds have a pop-up geometry. The dip of the basement towards the inner part of the fold-and- thrust belt is relatively gentle in the eastern SR/PP (1 °-l. 5 °) compared to the central SR/PP (2 °- 3 °). Mechanical considerations demonstrate that, unlike the relatively undeformed central SR/PP, a broad deformational zone has developed in the eastern SR/PP to provide a surface topographic slope necessary to maintain a critical taper of the thrust wedge. Furthermore, previous paleomagnetic studies indicate that deformation across much of the eastern PP preceded tectonic rotation. This implies that individual structural trends developed perpendicular to the transport direction and were then rotated into their current NE-SW alignment in response to ramping over a basement buttress in the central SR/PP. Cross-section balancing indicates that approximately 23. 1 km of shortening has occurred across the foreland in the eastern SR/PP since 5. 5 Ma, 17. 8 km in the last 2. 5 Ma. The shortening rate of 7 mm/yr for that time interval is roughly 15...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1983 The Santa Barbara-Montecito and Goleta basins are {{structurally}} continuous fault-controlled Pleistocene basins containing up to 3000 feet (925 m) {{of marine}} Pleistocene Santa Barbara Formation which were deposited on previously deformed Sisquoc and older strata. Structures subcropping against the unconformity {{at the base}} of the Santa Barbara Formation show that pre-basin deformation was mainly by folding. In addition, high-angle reverse faulting occurred along the Cameros, Goleta, and Modoc faults prior to Santa Barbara deposition in the Goleta basin. These are the oldest faults in the study area. Deposition of the Santa Barbara Formation began less than 1. 2 Ma ago. Post-Santa Barbara (post-basin) deformation includes <b>disharmonic</b> <b>folding</b> of incompetent Miocene strata above broad folds in competent Oligocene strata, as displayed in the Elwood oil field and La Goleta gas field, and reverse faulting along several south-dipping faults of large displacement. The More Ranch fault, which juxtaposes Sisquoc and older strata against the Santa Barbara and "Pico"(?) Formations, displaces a 40, 000 year old marine terrace, forms a north-facing eroded fault scarp, and marks the southern edge of the Goleta basin. The fault dips more than 80 ° south and displays up to a maximum of 2000 feet (610 m) vertical separation. The fault in the area with the largest amount of vertical separation, is the Coal Oil Point fault of post-Sisquoc age. This fault fails to reach the surface even though vertical separation of the Oligocene Vaqueros Formation is as great as 5400 feet (1650 m). Comparison with other faults in the area suggests that this fault belongs to the set of south-dipping, east-trending, Quaternary reverse faults that are characteristic of the coastal basins adjacent to the central Santa Ynez Mountains. All post-basin faults disrupt late Pleistocene strata and are potentially active. Other post-basin faults include the Mesa fault, which may link the More Ranch and Rincon Creek faults, the Lavigia fault which cuts older alluvium, and the San Jose fault which forms a north-facing scarp in late-Pleistocene fanglomerate. Distribution of aftershocks and focal mechanism solutions of the 1978 Santa Barbara earthquake suggest a gently north-dipping fault plane which would be unrelated to any of the faults exposed at the surface in the study area. However, the linear pattern of aftershock epicenters is parallel to the Mesa and Mission Ridge- Arroyo Parida faults; if the alternate south-dipping nodal plane is the correct solution then the earthquake could have originated on a member of the south-dipping fault set...|$|E
40|$|Kohat Plateau {{is located}} in the northwestern apex of the {{southern}} deformed fold and thrust belt that borders the entire Himalayan foothills in India and Pakistan. Detailed mapping, combined with structural analysis throughout the Kohat Plateau, and critical reassessment of the previously published data have resulted in reinterpretation of the structural evolution of this important part of the active foreland fold and trust belt of Northern Pakistan. The present study within the Kohat Plateau suggests that it is dominantly a thin skinned deformed fold and thrust belt over its major part, superimposed by thick-skinned structures in the south and has been distinguished as the Northern, Central and Southern Kohat Plateau. The thin-skinned structures aer well developed within the outcropping rocks of the Northern and Central part of the plateau and exhibit a variety of structural styles that include macroscopic-ups and triangle zones and relics of a folded thrust sheet. The macroscopic-scale doubly overturned <b>disharmonic</b> anticline <b>folds</b> are well exposed throughout the Northern Kohat Plateau and west of the longitude of the Jatta Ismail Khel in the Central Kohat Plateau. The imbricate fans, pop-ups and triangle zones are well depicted only east of the longitude of the Jatta Ismail Khel of the Central Kohat Plateau. Relics of a folded thrust sheet are observed in the Northern Kohat Plateau alone. The structural style within non-outcropping rocks of the plateau is dominated by a series of thrust splays getting younger towards south from the basal decollement. The motion along these thrust splays give rise to fault propagation folds in the overlying strata. Remarkable structural contrast has been observed within the outcropping and non-outcropping rocks both laterally and vertically and is ascribed to a major rheological change. The thick-skinned structures are confined to a zone (3 - 12 Kilometer wide) in the south, stetching from Zarwam in the west up to Banda Lakhoni in the east. This zone is defined by a couple of east west trending wrench faults that involve the basement as well, Deformational features related to this fault system include enechelon folds, steep to vertical dips and stratigraphic mismatch across the fault surfaces. The genesis of this wrench zone is related to the westward underthrusting of Kohat Plateau underneath the Sulaiman and Samana Ranges along the ranspressional boundary called as the Kurram Fault. Orientation of both large and small scale structures within the Kohat Plateau indicate that it has undergone deformation {{as a result of an}} earlier phase of compressional deformation related to north northwest horizontal compressional stresses with the exception in the southwest. Towards the southwestern boundary of the Kohat Plateau along the Bannu Basin, the earlier compressional structures are overprinted by a later phase of transpersonal deformation. The Kohat Plateau is dominantly a south-southeast vergent structural system impinging upon Bann Basin in the southwest and Punjab Foreland in the southeast. The Surghar Range in the southeast represents the active deformational front of the Kohat Plateau and is interpreted as strong to weakly emergent thrust front along which Paleozoic rocks are thrust southwards over the Punjab Foreland...|$|R
40|$|The Precambrian metasediments of the Grenville series, or rocks with kindred features, {{have been}} {{identified}} from Georgian Bay, southeastern Ontario, northeastward as far as Labrador and southward into the Adirondack Mountains of New York, the Green Mountains of Vermont, and the Precambrian highlands of northern New Jersey, southern New York, and southeastern Pennsylvania. This region also includes a distinctive series of intrusive rocks ranging from anorthosite to granite and may {{be referred to as}} the Grenville subprovince. The thickness of the Grenville series, or its inferred equivalents, is the subject of much speculation. Its maximum thickness is probably in southeastern Ontario and in the northwest Adirondacks, where the exposed sequences probably total about 20, 000 feet. Eastward, {{in the vicinity of the}} type locality at Grenville village, Argenteuil County, Quebec, the exposed Grenville series may be only 5000 or at most 10, 000 feet thick; northeast of the type locality, near Shawinigan Falls, the known Grenville series may be less than 5000 feet thick. Few data are available on thickness of the Grenville series in other parts of the subprovince. Most of the Grenville series is moderately to highly deformed, and injected. In the Adirondacks and in parts of Ontario and Quebec, the anorthosites appear to be the oldest rocks intrusive into the Grenville series, followed successively by gabbros, diorites, syenites, and a granitic complex. In some parts of western Quebec and elsewhere, a post-Grenville pre-anorthosite epoch of granitic intrusion may have occurred. Throughout the subprovince, however, an igneous series of anorthosite, gabbro, syenite, and granite appear to be genetically related, either as successive fractions from a deep-seated magma source or as differentiates evolved from a magma of intermediate composition during its penetration of the Grenville series. All the intrusive magmas have interacted with the Grenville series to produce hybrid rocks and skarns. The widespread chemical alterations and dynamothermal metamorphism of the Grenville series largely are related, however, to the emplacement of granites which post-date both anorthosite and gabbro. Some granitic masses exhibit well-defined contact-metamorphic aureoles. Elsewhere areas of granite are not clearly separable from granitized sediment and migmatite. Nests and irregular masses of skarn and contact minerals also are interspersed with relatively unaltered metasediment. Paragneisses are injected lit-par-lit and partially granitized. Some marbles are converted into hornblende-andesine amphibolites, and others, through interaction with granitic and aqueous fluids, are altered to or replaced by pyrite, magnetite, diopside, tremolite, phlogopite, scapolite, serpentine, talc, and many other minerals. A gross relationship exists between the most thoroughly deformed and sheared-out metasedimentsand areas of abundant igneous rock. Two of the best-documented examples of regional variations in degree of dynamothermal metamorphism that can be related to large igneous massifs are those in the Haliburton-Bancroft area of Ontario and in the Adirondack Mountains of New York. Even those metasediments farthest from igneous massifs are completely recrystallized and reconstituted, however, commonly into the amphibolite or a higher-rank metamorphic fades. In the clastic rocks almandite, biotite, and either oligoclase or potash feldspar are dominant minerals, and many segments of these rocks contain appreciable sillimanite. Carbonate rocks are dominated by diopside, tremolite, hornblende, and andesine with occasional nests of wollastonite formed along and near the contacts of various intrusive rocks. Most of the Grenville series, and the Grenville type metasediments, are highly folded, commonly along northeast-trending axes. Marked divergences from this regional trend are especially prominent in the vicinity of large anorthosite and granitic massifs. At least one region of more open folds and moderate deformation of the Grenville series appears between the Morin anorthosite mass and the Saguenay River In the areas of more profound deformation, all the metasediments have yielded not only by cataclassis but by profound solid flow. Flowage features are especially prominent, however, in the carbonate zones. Some of these carbonate units have pulled or flowed apart in areas of constriction or stretching, commonly along the short flanks of major folds, and are enormously thickened elsewhere, usually in apical areas of folds. Differences in rate or amount of flow in different lithologic layers have induced markedly <b>disharmonic</b> <b>folded</b> forms, pseudo-unconformities, and tectonic breccias. In general, however, rock motions have followed the sedimentary patterns, and the gross patterns of flow surfaces are rudely accordant with relict bedding. The dominant metasedimentary rock types within the Grenville series are marbles, quartzites, amphibolites, and biotitic, garnetiferous, and sillimanitic paragneisses. Siliceous and magnesian marbles are especially typical along and west of the Ottawa River, in southeastern Ontario, in the Adirondacks, Vermont, and in the highlands of northern New Jersey. Eastward beyond Lake St. John (St. Jean), Quebec, the correlation of the “Grenville series” is based largely upon amphibolites, quartzites, and “paragneisses” which include both biotitic and hornblendic quartz-feldspar gneisses. The southwesterly, carbonate-rich fades are in large part unequivocally correlative with the type section described by Logan near Grenville village, Quebec. In the Adirondacks and northwest toward the Haliburton-Bancroft area of Ontario, this segment of the Grenville series includes at least two magnesian carbonate units, each a mile or more thick before metamorphism. These appear to thin northeastward from the type locality and southeast across the Adirondacks. In northern New Jersey, however, the Grenville-type marble of the Franklin formation appears to be at least 2000 feet thick. The magnesia content of the marbles may be in part primary or syngenetic, although in the Haliburton-Bancroft area of Ontario, in parts of southwestern Quebec, and in northern New Jersey, dolomitization of an initially calcitic marble is reportedly related to the intrusion of igneousrocks. In the Northwest Adirondacks, some of the oldest marble layers are dolomite. Some of the magnesia in these has been abstracted during metamorphism, moved appreciable distances, and concentrated in deposits of tremolite, anthophyllite, serpentine, and talc. Much of the silica in the marbles of the Grenville series undoubtedly is primary although probably a fourth to a half of the present total is introduced. Other substances in the marble which may be at least in part sedimentary include pyrite, graphite, gypsum, anhydrite, halite, and members of the paraffin series. In the northwest Adirondacks, anhydrite and methane occur in well-defined interbeds, and the existing data favor a sedimentary origin for these components. Quartz-feldspar paragneisses, either appreciably sillimanitic and garnetiferous or highly biotitic, appear almost everywhere that Grenville-like rocks are found in the subprovince. In areas of appreciable marble paragneisses commonly rank second to marbles in abundance. In the northwest Adirondacks, for example, the largest gneissic unit is about 3000 feet thick. Northeastward from the type locality, as the marbles thin or disappear, paragneisses tend to dominate the Grenville series. Most of the thicker gneissic units are either quartz-sillimanite-feldspar or quartz-biotite-feldspar types, in general much injected by granite. In the Adirondacks, in parts of southeastern Ontario, east of the Saguenay River in Quebec, and in New Jersey, the least-altered gneisses have a bulk composition approaching that of many graywackes, dacitic tuffs, or sodic shales. Along the Ottawa River, however, and in parts of southwestern Quebec, the paragneisses seem to approach more closely the composition of Clarke's average shale. Quartzites appear as narrow interlayers and as zones throughout the known and inferred extent of the Grenville series. Among the quartzites are almost pure quartz types, as well as types intermediate between quartzite and gneiss, marble, and amphibolite. Many of the siliceous interlayers, especially in the marble, are either laminated or lenticular to nodular, and some if not most of these rocks presumably were deposited as microcrystalline cherts or novaculite-like types. Amphibolites also are ubiquitous. Most are hornblende-andesine rocks with associated augite, diopside, apatite, calcite, and other minerals. Many amphibolites clearly are derived from gabbroic and basaltic rocks, and others as surely represent skarnlike replacements of marbles. In addition, numerous amphibolites are inferred to represent reconstituted tuffs and marly interbeds. In many areas of the Grenville subprovince, however, neither the rock types transitional between the parent and the resulting amphibolite, nor the parent rock are preserved, and the origin of the evolved amphibolite cannot be stated with any assurance. An obvious corollary is that problems of stratigraphic and structural synthesis are greatly complicated where the section includes an appreciable thickness of enigmatic amphibolites. The characteristic assemblage of marble, paragneiss, and quartzites which constitutes the typical Grenville series has been described repeatedly as representing “normal marine limestones, shales and sandstones of the well sorted type. ” Other workers in the same or near-by areas have described interlayers and zones n i the Grenville series as arkoses, tuffs, and graywackes. Some of the same parts of the Grenville series also are depicted as either including, or being intimately associated with, conglomerates, pillow lavas, and iron formations. The implication is clearly that of a highly anomalous association of rock types which do not fit into contemporary, genetic classifications, or readily inferred environments, of sediments. Many seeming contradictions disappear, however, if all citations of original sedimentary fades are excluded from discussions except those that are reasonably established in origin and recognizable as probable parts of the Grenville series. Some real enigmas remain, nevertheless, which cannot be ascribed to inaccurate identifications or uncertain correlations. All the examples of sedimentary iron formation ascribed to the Grenville series appear to be most hypothetical, if not spurious. Arkoses are equally suspect, especially in the carbonate-rich segments of the series. Feldspathic quartzites or paragneisses are common enough as integral parts of the sequence, but instead of representing arkoses these are more reasonably interpreted as secondarily feldspathized quartzites or as reconstituted, illitic sandstones. The term graywacke is applied widely and loosely in descriptions of the Grenville series to many gray to dark-green gneissic and schistose interlayers which must have had divergent origins. In Hastings County, Ontario, however, and southwestward along this margin of the Grenville subprovince, unequivocal conglomerates, pillow lavas, and probably agglomerates either underlie, or overlie, and possibly form interlayers in carbonate-rich segments of the Grenville series. These suggest that the Grenville series of this area was deposited on an unstable area of the earth's crust in which positive as well as markedly negative segments evolved during sedimentation. Graywackes may have formed although documentary data on their existence are lacking. Eastward from this area, the conglomerates and lavas disappear, although part of this region includes not only marble and quartzites, but the paragneisses with the composition and many lithologic features of graywackes, tuffs, or aberrantly sodic shales. There are in addition the paragneisses which may have evolved from typical shales. The extreme thickness of the section, the abundance of siliceous magnesian carbonate rocks, and the probable occurrence of sedimentary anhydrite and halite suggest that this segment of the Grenville series was deposited in a large persistently negative basin, either periodically or locally cut off from the open ocean. The basin appears to have extended from Lake Nipissing southeastward across the Adirondacks, possibly into New Jersey. Its northeast margin must have been well beyond the type locality in western Quebec. The environment of deposition of the Grenville-type sediments northeast of the Saguenay will remain most speculative until much more is known of the composition and geologic features of the metasediments. They undoubtedly are derived from clastic rocks, especially sandstones and finer fractions. Marbles are uncommon, or relatively unimportant, although some of the amphibolites could represent skarnlike replacements of carbonate zones. Whether arkoses or graywackes are represented also is of particular interest in proposing an environment of deposition. The numerous reports of abundant sodic oligoclase in many of the paragneisses suggest that some clastic zones could have been graywackes, or tuffs of intermediate composition, or sodic shales. Throughout most of the Grenville subprovince, the Grenville series are the oldest decipherable rocks. Analyses of lead and uranium in granitic and pegmatitic minerals, and of helium in magnetite ores in the Grenville subprovince give ages ranging from 1. 0 x 10 ^ 9 to 1. 3 x 10 ^ 9 years. All these minerals were emplaced at about the culmination of metamorphism of the Grenville series. Earlier epochs as yet undated include the premetamorphic intrusions of anorthosites, gabbros, and syenites and the period of Grenville sedimentation. Presumably the inception of this sedimentation occurred some 1. 2 x 10 ^ 9 or more years ago...|$|R
40|$|The Levang granite {{forms an}} {{elliptical}} body occupying {{the core of}} a broad antiformal structure, and covering approximately 50 sq. km. Surrounding this mass of granitoid gneisses is a series of banded gneisses of very variable composition, including amphibolites, quartzltes, and nodular sillimanite gneisses. Against these rocks the granitic gneisses make a sharp, though in places 'interfingered' contact. Agmatitl relationships are never seen. Further south, on the PortOr sub-peninsula, migmatitic granitoid gneisses are exposed which have mineral assemblages identical to those of rock types from within the main Levang granite. The composition of the Levang granite gneisses is variable, ranging from quartz monzonltic to tonalitic types lacking potash feldspar, but on the whole corresponds fairly closely with the minimum melting composition of the granite system. Over much the greater area the Levang granite is strongly foliated, and everywhere shows some degree of preferred planar or linear orientation of minerals. The foliation always parallels the contacts, and it defines a complex fold system, within the granite which is in complete structural conformity with that of the surrounding banded gneisses and migmatites. The overall symmetry of the structure is triclinic, the plunge of the linear elements varying from horizontal to vertical. The β axis of the domal structure {{in the eastern part of}} the granite mass is completely overturned. Traced eastwards from the core of the dome, P trends initially due east north east, steepens to vertical, and then plunges due west at angles of 60 to 70. The very complex tectonic evolution has probably involved <b>disharmonic</b> <b>folding</b> and two phases of deformation. Within the Levang granite amphibolitic sheets and lenses are invariably conformable to the fold pattern defined by the granite gneiss foliation. In the Helligesvann brachyanticline, a regular sequence of granitoid gneisses of variable composition, interlayered with a thick amphibolitic sheet which forms an unbroken horizon, indicates the presence of a 'ghost' stratigraphy. Investigation of the potash feldspar obliquities shows that all the potash feldspars, from granitic gneisses, migmatites, and pegmatites, are more or less fully ordered maximum microclines. The fact that some of the granitic gneisses approximate to the minimum melting composition is not conclusive evidence in favour of an origin through anatexis or fractional crystallization, in view of the spatial distribution of these rocks, their metamorphic textures, and the nature of the basic inclusions. The Levang granite is a metamorphic rock, the result of the transformation in an open system of a pre-existing series of supra- crustal rocks by processes of granitization and metasomatism...|$|E
