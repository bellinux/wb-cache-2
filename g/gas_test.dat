The preanalytical steps in testing, from choosing the correct tests to ensuring the specimen is introduced into the instrument correctly, must be perfectly coordinated to ensure that the patient receives appropriate and timely therapy in response to the analytical results. While many of the preanalytical steps in blood <b>gas</b> <b>testing</b> are common to all laboratory tests, such as accurate specimen labeling, some are unique to this testing because of the physicochemical properties of the analytes being measured.

40|$|AbstractA {{study on}} the {{influence}} of the <b>gas</b> <b>testing</b> systems in the behavior of solid-state electrochemical exhaust gas sensors is presented. Several YSZ-based exhaust gas sensors have been tested in different versions of <b>gas</b> <b>testing</b> chambers, with different architectures, volumes, exhaust gas flow dynamics, temperature regulation, etc. Sensors have been <b>tested</b> in synthetic <b>gas</b> <b>testing</b> chambers and in real combustion systems. Results show that parameters such as the response time or even the equilibrium open circuit voltage may be strongly dependent on the characteristics of the testing system. Moreover, a lack of gas flow homogeneity or a wrong temperature distribution in the testing chamber may dramatically influence the behavior of exhaust gas sensors. Optimum designs of experimental systems are presented in terms of the sensing characteristics to be tested...|$|R
5000|$|Blood gas tension {{refers to}} the partial {{pressure}} of gases in blood. [...] There are several significant purposes for measuring gas tension; the most common gas tensions measured are oxygen tension (PxO2), the carbon dioxide tension (PxCO2) and carbon monoxide tension (PxCO). The subscript x in each symbol represents {{the source of the}} gas being measured; [...] "a" [...] meaning arterial, [...] "A" [...] being alveolar, [...] "v" [...] being venous, [...] "c" [...] being capillary.

50|$|An {{arterial}} blood <b>gas</b> <b>test</b> (ABG) is a blood <b>gas</b> <b>test</b> of blood taken from an artery that measures {{the amounts of}} certain gases (such as oxygen and carbon dioxide) dissolved in {{arterial blood}}. An ABG test usually involves a radial artery puncture using a thin needle and syringe and drawing a small volume of blood, but sometimes the femoral artery in the groin or another site is used. The blood can also be drawn from an arterial catheter. An ABG test measures the blood gas tension values of the arterial partial pressure of oxygen, and the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and the blood's pH. In addition, the arterial oxygen saturation can be determined. Such information is vital when caring for patients with critical illness or respiratory disease. Therefore, the ABG test {{is one of the}} most common tests performed on patients in intensive care units. In other levels of care, pulse oximetry plus transcutaneous carbon dioxide measurement is an alternative method of obtaining similar information less invasively.|$|E

The blood gas tension levels of partial pressures can be used as indicators of ventilation, respiration and oxygenation.|$|E
