We investigated the beneficial effects of a <b>follow-on</b> <b>milk</b> formula supplemented with short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides (scFOS) in healthy infants after 4 months of age. Subjects/methods 75 formula-fed healthy infants were included at the age of 4 months in a randomized, controlled, double blind study and received either a placebo or scFOS supplemented formula for six months. Faecal poliovirus sIgA after vaccination and bifidobacteria concentration, height, weight and digestive tolerance were monitored. ResultsAfter 1 and 2 months of supplementation, no significant difference was observed between the groups for the evolution of poliovirus sIgA concentration compared to baseline. A significant increase in bifidobacteria count was observed after 1 month of ScFOS supplementation, but this difference was no longer significant after 2 months. Breastfeeding history of infants was shown {{to have an impact on}} faecal bifidobacteria evolution. Tolerance and growth parameters were similar in the 2 groups. ConclusionsA <b>follow-on</b> <b>milk</b> formula supplemented with scFOS modulates intestinal microbiota via an increase of faecal bifidobacteria concentration, while no effect on sIgA concentrations could be demonstrated. scFOS addition elicited normal digestive tolerance and normal growth suggesting it can be used safely at 5 g/L in infants after 4 months of age...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Because of {{the limited}} vitamin D {{synthesis}} in the skin in the Netherlands between October and April, this study investigated the influence of food (butter, milk and fish) and vitamin D supplements on the serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D) concentration in this period, and during the whole year. Material and methods: There were 382 children aged between 1 and 18 years enrolled. Using a questionnaire, information was collected on the intake and synthesis of vitamin D. The children were divided into three age groups: preschoolers (1 - 4 years), school-aged children (4 - 13 years) and adolescents (≥ 13 years). Results: In all participants, sunlight (p = 0, 000), vitamin D supplements (p = 0, 000) and food (p = 0, 000) had a significant influence on the serum 25 (OH) D concentration. The type of food that had the greatest influence was the residual group, which consisted for example of toddler milk, soy milk, buttermilk, <b>follow-on</b> <b>milk</b> and yoghurt. In school-aged children, sunlight (p = 0, 000) and vitamin D supplements (p = 0, 008) had a significant influence. Between October and April, food (p = 0, 004) had a significant influence on the serum 25 (OH) D concentration in all participants, and in school-aged children, fish intake (p = 0, 002) had a significant influence. 51, 1 % of all participants had vitamin D deficiency (VDD) between October and April. Conclusion: Between October and April, food has a significant influence on the serum 25 (OH) D concentration. There is a positive trend between whole milk and the residual group, for example of toddler milk, soy milk, buttermilk, <b>follow-on</b> <b>milk</b> and yoghurt, and the serum 25 (OH) D concentration, but this trend was not significant. Because many school-aged children and adolescents have VDD, there should be guidelines for good nutrition and vitamin D supplementation. ...|$|E
40|$|Milk, {{which is}} an {{important}} source of nutrition is used for infant feeding and consumed widely all over the world. Mycotoxins are one of the chemical contaminants that are known to pass through milk. They are produced by molds and pass through milk, and may cause health problems in infants. Determination of aflatoxin M 1 levels in follow-on milks {{which is one of the}} most important nutrients for healthy grown babies is important in prevention of toxic effects of mycotoxins. Promoting social protection studies concerning aflatoxins as milk contaminants and raising awareness on follow-on milks is important in protection of public health. In our study, investigation of aflatoxin M 1 in follow-on milks; a product that newborns take in their diet, and to evaluate the results in terms of public health. For this purpose, 60 <b>follow-on</b> <b>milk</b> samples with different serial numbers were collected from 7 companies. In Turkish Food Codex Communique related to the contaminations in food products with in accordance with the law no 2008 / 6 for preparation compliance as part of European Onion, indicated that the raw milk, UHT milk and other milks used for production of some products containing milk, maximum aflatoxin M 1 should be 0. 05 µg/kg (parts per billion). Aflatoxin M 1 concentrations were determined by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Our results showed that 37 samples contained aflatoxin M 1 with 0. 05 parts per billion concentrations. In conclusion, the latter 23 samples including aflatoxin M 1 values above Turkish Food Codex limits are important in terms of public health...|$|E
40|$|MSc (Nutrition), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Introduction: Exclusive {{breastfeeding}} (EBF) contributes towards reducing {{infant and}} young child mortality however global EBF rates are sub-optimal. One {{of the factors}} that influences a mothers‟ choice to exclusively breastfeed her child, is the marketing of breast milk substitutes. The International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes (ICMBS) was developed to promote, protect and support EBF. Although South Africa has adopted the ICMBS, the Code was only legislated in December 2012 to ensure compliance. Aim: To do a baseline assessment of the extent of ICMBS violations in the South African advertising media including magazines, newspapers, television (TV) and radio. Methods: In this cross-sectional study data were collected on multiple occasions. Data were collected by means of recording and/or screening daily broadcasts from four TV channels (SABC 1, 2, 3 and e. tv), nine commercial radio stations, 116 different magazines and 10 different newspapers for ICMBS violations. This study was done within a period of four months between November 2012 and January 2014. Violations pertaining to advertising media include advertising or promoting infant formula, other milk products marketed for children up to 36 months of age (e. g. growing-up milk or <b>follow-on</b> <b>milk),</b> foods for infants younger than six months, any other food or beverages marketed or represented to be suitable for the use as partial or total replacements of breast milk, and feeding bottles and teats to the general public (article 5. 1 of the ICMBS). Results: A total number of 30 violations were identified from 117 baby product advertisements that were published in eight of the 169 screened magazines. No violations were found from advertisements on TV, radio or in newspapers. The majority of advertisements that violated article 5. 1 of the ICMBS, were advertisements of feeding bottles (60 %), followed by advertisements of growing-up milk (20 %) and feeding teats (16. 7 %). Only one violation (3. 3 %) was an advertisement of infant food for infants younger than six months. Advertisements with violations were advertising baby products from 11 different companies. More than half of the violations (56. 7 %) were published in two editions from the same magazine, or inserts within that magazine, who‟s target group was pregnant women. Eight advertisements with violations (26. 6 %) were published in family magazines, three (10 %) were published in baby magazines, and two (6. 7 %) were published in lifestyle magazines. Conclusion: According to the present baseline study, ICMBS violations were only found in a small percentage (4. 7 %) of magazines targeted mainly at pregnant women. However, although the present study included the majority of available South African magazines distributed in South Africa, not all the available newspapers, TV channels and radio stations were included in the sample size. The true extent of ICMBS violations in the South African advertising media may therefore be higher. It can also not be concluded that BMS companies use only magazines to advertise products pertaining to the scope of the ICMBS. A follow-up study need to determine the impact of legislating the Code on ICMBS violations in advertising media. Master...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{the introduction of}} complementary foods in a population-based cohort in relation to recommendations and explore the possible impact of maternal education on infant feeding practices. DESIGN: Prospective data from the All Babies in Southeast Sweden (ABIS) cohort study were used. The ABIS study invited all infants born in south-east Sweden during October 1997 -October 1999 (n 21 700) to participate. A questionnaire was completed for 16 022 infants. During the infants' first year parents continuously filed in a diary covering introduction of foods. SETTING: Sweden. SUBJECTS: Infants (n 9727) with completed food diaries. RESULTS: Potatoes, vegetables, fruits/berries and porridge were the foods first introduced, with a median introduction between 19 and 22 weeks, followed by introduction of meat, cow's <b>milk,</b> <b>follow-on</b> formula and sour milk/yoghurt between 24 and 27 weeks. Early introduction of any food, before 16 weeks, occurred for 27 % of the infants and was more common in infants of mothers with low education. Overall, potatoes (14 · 7 %), vegetables (11 · 1 %), fruits/berries (8 · 5 %), porridge (7 · 4 %) and follow-on formula (2 · 7 %) were the foods most frequently introduced early. The majority of infants (≥ 70 %) were introduced to potatoes, vegetables, fruits/berries and porridge during concurrent breast-feeding, but introduction during concurrent breast-feeding was less common in infants of mothers with low education. CONCLUSIONS: Most infants were introduced to complementary foods timely in relation to recommendations. Low maternal education was associated with earlier introduction of complementary foods and less introduction during concurrent breast-feeding. Still, the results indicated exposure to fewer foods at 12 months in infants of mothers with low education.
