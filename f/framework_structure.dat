The resulting 3D homochiral MOF {• 4DMF • 6MeOH • 3H2O} (L=(R)-6,6'-dichloro-2,2'-dihydroxyl-1,1'-binaphthyl-bipyridine) synthesized by Lin was shown to have a similar catalytic efficiency for the diethylzinc addition reaction as compared to the homogeneous analogue when was pretreated by Ti(OiPr)4 to generate the grafted Ti- BINOLate species.

B54–B59 sites form the irregularly shaped B16 polyhedron {{in which only}} 10.7 boron atoms are available because most of sites are too {{close to each other}} to be occupied simultaneously. Ten bridging sites C60–B69 interconnect polyhedron units or other bridging sites to form a 3D boron <b>framework</b> <b>structure.</b> One description of the crystal structure uses three pillar-like units that extend along the c-axis that however results in undesired overlaps between those three pillar-like units.

25|$|Homochiral MOFs {{have been}} made by Lin and {{coworkers}} using 2,2′-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1′-binaphthyl (BINAP), 1,1′-bi-2,2′-naphthol (BINOL) as a chiral ligands. These ligands can coordinate with catalytically active metal sites to enhance the enantioselectivity. A variety of linking groups such as pyridine, phosphonic acid, and carboxylic acid can be selectively introduced to the 3,3′, 4,4′, and the 6,6′ positions of the 1,1'-binaphthyl moiety. Moreover, by changing the length of the linker ligands the porosity and <b>framework</b> <b>structure</b> of the MOF can be selectivily tuned.|$|E

25|$|This complex bonding {{behavior}} originates {{from the}} fact that boron has only three valence electrons; this hinders tetrahedral bonding as in diamond or hexagonal bonding as in graphite. Instead, boron atoms form polyhedra. For example, three boron atoms make up a triangle where they share two electrons to complete the so-called three-center bonding. Boron polyhedra, such as B6 octahedron, B12 cuboctahedron and B12 icosahedron, lack two valence electrons per polyhedron to complete the polyhedron-based <b>framework</b> <b>structure.</b> Metal atoms need to donate two electrons per boron polyhedron to form boron-rich metal borides. Thus, boron compounds are often regarded as electron-deficient solids.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{structure}} unit of YB66, {{shown in}} figure 4b, is B80 cluster of 80 boron sites formed by the B10 to B13 sites. All those 80 sites are partially occupied and in total contain only about 42 boron atoms. The B80 cluster {{is located at the}} body center of the octant of the unit cell, i.e., at the 8a position (1/4, 1/4, 1/4); thus, there are eight such clusters (336 boron atoms) per unit cell. Two independent structure analyses [...] came to the same conclusion that the total number of boron atoms in the unit cell is 1584. The boron <b>framework</b> <b>structure</b> of YB66 is {{shown in figure}} 5a. To indicate relative orientations of the supericosahedra, a schematic drawing is shown in figure 5b, where the supericosahedra and the B80 clusters are depicted by light green and dark green spheres, respectively; at the top surface of the unit cell, the relative orientations of the supericosahedra are indicated by arrows. There are 48 yttrium sites ((0.0563, 1/4, 1/4) for YB62) in the unit cell. Richards and Kasper fixed the Y site occupancy to 0.5 that resulted in 24 Y atoms in the unit cell and the chemical composition of YB66. As shown in figure 6, Y sites form a pair separated by only 0.264nm in YB62. This pair is aligned normal to the plane formed by four supericosahedra. The Y site occupancy 0.5 implies that the pair has always one Y atom with one empty site.|$|E

40|$|Today {{synthetic}} zeolites are {{the most}} important catalysts in petrochemical refineries because of their high internal surface areas and molecular-sieving properties 1, 2.
