25|$|Forage fish occupy central {{positions}} in the ocean food webs. The position that a fish occupies <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> web is called its trophic level (Greek trophē = food). The organisms it eats are at a lower trophic level, and the organisms that eat it are at a higher trophic level. Forage fish occupy middle levels in the food web, serving as a dominant prey to higher level fish, seabirds and mammals.|$|E
25|$|Trophic cascades {{occur when}} predators <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> web {{suppress}} the abundance or alter {{the behavior of}} their prey, thereby releasing the next lower trophic level from predation (or herbivory if the intermediate trophic level is a herbivore). For example, if the abundance of large piscivorous fish is increased in a lake, the abundance of their prey, smaller fish that eat zooplankton, should decrease. The resulting increase in zooplankton should, in turn, cause the biomass of its prey, phytoplankton, to decrease.|$|E
25|$|The base or basal species <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> web {{are those}} species without prey and can include autotrophs or {{saprophytic}} detritivores (i.e., {{the community of}} decomposers in soil, biofilms, and periphyton). Feeding connections in the web are called trophic links. The number of trophic links per consumer {{is a measure of}} food web connectance. Food chains are nested within the trophic links of food webs. Food chains are linear (noncyclic) feeding pathways that trace monophagous consumers from a base species up to the top consumer, which is usually a larger predatory carnivore.|$|E

They cultivated other organisms <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> chain rooted in the farm's organic sludge.

25|$|Trophic cascades {{occur when}} predators <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> chain {{suppress}} {{the abundance of}} their prey, thereby releasing the next lower trophic level from predation (or herbivory if the intermediate trophic level is an herbivore). For example, if the abundance of large piscivorous fish is increased in a lake, the abundance of their prey, zooplanktivorous fish, should decrease, large zooplankton abundance should increase, and phytoplankton biomass should decrease. This theory has stimulated new research {{in many areas of}} ecology. Trophic cascades may also be important for understanding the effects of removing top predators from food webs, as humans have done in many places through hunting and fishing activities.|$|E
25|$|Salicylate-containing foods include apples, citrus fruits, strawberries, tomatoes, and wine, while {{reactions}} to chocolate, cheese, bananas, avocado, tomato or wine point to amines as the likely food chemical.

25|$|A common metric used to {{quantify}} food web trophic structure is food chain length. Food chain length {{is another way}} of describing food webs as a measure of the number of species encountered as energy or nutrients move from the plants to top predators. There are different ways of calculating food chain length depending on what parameters of the food web dynamic are being considered: connectance, energy, or interaction. In its simplest form, the length of a chain is the number of links between a trophic consumer and the base of the web. The mean chain length of an entire web is the arithmetic average of the lengths of all chains <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> web.|$|E
