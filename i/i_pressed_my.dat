60|$|The cock crew, and {{the night}} seemed to fade away into greyness. The first light of dawn broke through the windows, and <b>I</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>my</b> love to my heart in one last kiss.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The fact is,' {{she would}} observe when <b>I</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>my</b> suit, 'the fact is I look {{higher than a}} mere showman, even if he can write M.D. after his name.' Philippa soon left the circuit 'to better herself.' ...|$|E

60|$|Diom. Nay, since you're so {{concerned}} to be believed, I'm sorry <b>I</b> have <b>pressed</b> <b>my</b> charge so far: Be {{what you would}} be thought; I can be grateful.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sacrifice! What do I sacrifice? Famine for food, {{expectation}} for content. To be {{privileged to}} put my arms round what <b>I</b> value--to <b>press</b> <b>my</b> lips to what I love--to repose on what I trust: is that to make a sacrifice? If so, then certainly I delight in sacrifice." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>my</b> lips to his once {{brilliant}} and now rayless eyes--I swept his hair from his brow, and kissed that too. He suddenly seemed to arouse himself: {{the conviction of}} the reality of all this seized him.|$|E
6000|$|I fell flat down again, {{in which}} {{position}} Jack left {{me to go}} and fetch me some dinner. He returned quickly with a plate of soup. Before commencing to eat it <b>I</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>my</b> hand on my forehead, and said-- ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{may well}} be fancied that I did not stand still many seconds {{to take in the}} scene. It was pictured upon my mind like a flash of light, and then <b>I</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>my</b> knife against Seth's breast, {{whispering}} in his ear: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see," [...] {{he said at}} last. [...] "I understand. Well, Miss Rowley, I quite {{perceive}} that <b>I</b> cannot <b>press</b> <b>my</b> suit any further now. But I shall not despair altogether. I know this, that if I might possibly succeed, I should be a very happy man. Good-bye, Miss Rowley." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> do not <b>press</b> <b>my</b> fingers {{across my}} mouth, [...] I keep as {{delicate}} around the bowels as around {{the head and}} heart, [...] Copulation is no more rank to me than death is.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had better}} {{come to the}} point at once," [...] said Mrs. Askerton. [...] "If--if--if it should ever suit you, pray come here to us. Flowers shall not be more welcome in May. It is {{difficult}} to speak of it all, though you both understand everything as well as I do. <b>I</b> cannot <b>press</b> <b>my</b> invitation as another woman might." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He wouldn't {{be bothered}} with more?" [...] This squared well enough with my {{impressions}} of him: {{he was not a}} trouble-loving gentleman, nor so very particular perhaps about some of the company HE kept. All the same, <b>I</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>my</b> interlocutress. [...] "I promise you I would have told!" ...|$|E
60|$|A faint stir in {{the woods}} {{suddenly}} caught my attention. The sound neared. <b>I</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>my</b> hand to my breast, torn now between two incentives, two desires--to fly, to stay. And on the path by which I had come, appeared, some yards distant, in the faint trickling light, the dark figure of my dreams.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{has taken}} up with that snake of a Tory brood simply because of believing that those on the Sims {{plantation}} stand higher in favor with the red-coated soldiers than do we of the Hamilton plantation!" [...] Saul cried angrily, and so incautiously loud that <b>I</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>my</b> hand over his mouth as I whispered in reproof: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'A {{thousand}} salaams,' he exclaimed, when he {{had reached}} Tancred; 'there is but one God. <b>I</b> <b>press</b> you to <b>my</b> heart of hearts. There are also other friends, {{but they are not}} here.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Blessed art thou, my son!" [...] she sobbed. [...] "My {{heart was}} withered--yea, dead with thee and with thy father--and now it leaps {{as in the}} first moment when <b>I</b> <b>pressed</b> thee to <b>my</b> bosom." ...|$|R
60|$|Then, feeling {{carefully}} {{around at}} the very edge, so that I might force it upward {{in such a manner}} as to form a lid that would drop back into place again, <b>I</b> <b>pressed</b> with all <b>my</b> strength.|$|R
6000|$|Not {{only were}} my wrists bound, but the lasso had been wrapped round my elbows, holding them {{close to my}} body. Turning on my side, I found that I could not reach the knife--not by several inches. This was a bitter disappointment. I {{strained}} and heaved. In my effort to lift my body sidewise <b>I</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>my</b> face into the gravel. [...] "Hurry, Ken, hurry!" [...] cried Dick. [...] "Somebody's coming!" ...|$|E
60|$|Do you know, I {{went into}} your room? I {{contrived}} to ascend alone; the good woman followed me, but I was there alone a moment, and, and, and, {{what do you}} think I did? <b>I</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>my</b> lips to your pillow. I could not help it; when I thought that his dear head had rested there so often and so lately, I could not refrain from pressing my lips to that favoured resting-place, and I am afraid I shed a tear besides.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>my</b> {{wainscot}} bell. After {{an unusual}} delay in a drastically regulated household, {{the door behind}} me gently opened. I began simpering directions over my shoulder in the Percy way with servants--and presently realized that all was not quite as it should be. I turned to look, and saw thrust in at the doorway an apparently bodiless, protuberant head, with black, buttony eyes on either side a long, long nose. Then the remainder of this figure squeezed reluctantly in. It was Adam Waggett.|$|E
6000|$|Where {{have you}} {{disposed}} of their carcasses? [...] Those drunkards and gluttons {{of so many}} generations? [...] Where have you drawn off all the foul liquid and meat? [...] I do not see any of it upon you to-day, or perhaps I am deceiv'd, [...] I will run a furrow with <b>my</b> plough, <b>I</b> will <b>press</b> <b>my</b> spade through [...] the sod and turn it up underneath, [...] I am sure I shall expose some of the foul meat.|$|R
6000|$|How oft, my Love! with {{shapings}} sweet [...] 85 [...] I {{paint the}} moment, we shall meet! [...] With eager speed I dart-- [...] I seize {{you in the}} vacant air, [...] And fancy, with a husband's care [...] <b>I</b> <b>press</b> you to <b>my</b> heart! [...] 90 ...|$|R
60|$|This gradual {{recovery}} of the world--this slow reopening of the great flower, Life--is beautiful to feel and see. <b>I</b> <b>press</b> <b>my</b> hand flat and hard down on those blades of grass, then take it away, and watch them very slowly raise themselves and shake off the bruise. So it is, and will be, {{with us for a}} long time to come. The cramp of war was deep in us, as an iron frost in the earth. Of all the countless millions who have fought and nursed and written and spoken and dug and sewn and worked in a thousand other ways to help on the business of killing, hardly any have laboured in real love of war. Ironical, indeed, that perhaps the most beautiful poem written these four years, Julian Grenfell's 'Into Battle!' was in heartfelt praise of fighting! But if one could gather the deep curses breathed by man and woman upon war since the first bugle was blown, the dirge of them could not be contained in the air which wraps this earth.|$|R
60|$|To think, with me, is to act. Grasping Thuvia by the arm, I {{whispered to}} Tars Tarkas to follow me. Quickly we glided toward a small flier which lay furthest from the battling warriors. Another instant found us huddled {{on the tiny}} deck. My hand was on the {{starting}} lever. <b>I</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>my</b> thumb upon the button which controls the ray of repulsion, that splendid discovery of the Martians which permits them to navigate the thin atmosphere of their planet in huge ships that dwarf the dreadnoughts of our earthly navies into pitiful insignificance.|$|E
60|$|I {{was awakened}} {{early in the}} morning by some huge body {{pressing}} close to mine, and opening my eyes with a start I beheld my blessed old Woola snuggling close to me; the faithful brute had followed us across that trackless waste to share our fate, whatever it might be. Putting my arms about his neck <b>I</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>my</b> cheek close to his, nor am I ashamed that I did it, nor of the tears that came to my eyes as I thought of his love for me. Shortly after this Dejah Thoris and Sola awakened, and it was decided that we push on at once in an effort to gain the hills.|$|E
6000|$|Now that I {{had done}} this thing a {{reaction}} set in upon me. I felt that my burden lived, for I heard the faint beat of her heart as <b>I</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>my</b> ear against her side in carrying her. Knowing this, I threw her down beside the fire which Madge had lit, with as little sympathy {{as though she had}} been a bundle of fagots. I never glanced at her to see if she were fair or no. For many years I had cared little for the face of a woman. As I lay in my hammock upstairs, however, I heard the old woman as she chafed the warmth back into her, crooning a chorus of, [...] "Eh, the puir lassie! Eh, the bonnie lassie!" [...] from which I gathered that this piece of jetsam was both young and comely.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wrong!" [...] cried her brother, [...] "doesn't middling-bad {{stand beside}} it, with {{quite as good}} a claim to be {{considered}} half-way? However, <b>I</b> won't <b>press</b> <b>my</b> victory too far. For the sake of peace we will agree that these are semi-detached houses in one block--and that will block the subject. But, to be serious again," [...] he added, stopping and looking earnestly into his sister's face, [...] "I wanted {{to speak to you}} on this weakness--this sin--and I thank you for breaking the ice. The truth is that I have felt for a good while past that conviviality--" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>pressed</b> {{her against}} <b>my</b> heart, and my lips {{imprinted}} a delicate kiss upon her forehead. After which, with chaste decorum, she once more {{turned away from}} me, covered her face and head with the shawl, and drew back into the remote corner of the carriage, where she remained, silent and absorbed, no doubt, in the contemplation of her happiness.|$|R
60|$|Snatching {{the rifle}} from Hans, I loaded it myself; nothing must {{be trusted to}} another. As I put on the cap a vulture made its last circle. It {{hung in the air}} just as the others had done, and oh! its tail was towards me. I lifted, I aimed between the gathered-up legs, <b>I</b> <b>pressed</b> and shut <b>my</b> eyes, for I did not dare to look.|$|R
6000|$|... "Herr von Catt {{accompanied}} me {{into the}} anteroom, and Schmucker followed. I could not stir from the spot; could not speak, was so charmed and so touched, that I broke into a stream of tears [being very weak of nerves at the time!]. Herr von Catt said: 'I am now {{going back to the}} King; go you into the room where I took you up; about eight I will conduct you home.' <b>I</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>my</b> excellent countryman's hand, I"--"Schmucker said, I had stood too near his Majesty; I had spoken too frankly, with too much vivacity; nay, what was unheard of in the world, I had 'gesticulated' before his Majesty! 'In presence of a King,' said Herr Schmucker, 'one must stand stiff and not stir.' De Catt came back to us at eight; and, in Schmucker's presence [let him chew the cud of that!], reported the following little Dialogue with the King:-- ...|$|E
60|$|Without {{checking}} the beast I managed {{to loosen the}} valise strapped before me, and hurled it down upon the prairie. It contained all I possessed {{in the shape of}} civilized apparel except what I rode in, and that was mired all over from the flounder through the creek; but the horse already carried weight enough. It was now blazing noon, and in the prairie summer the sun is fiercely hot. Here and there the bitter dust of alkali rolled across the waste, crusting our dripping faces and the coats of the lathered beasts. My eyelashes grew foul and heavy, blurring my vision, so that it was but dimly I saw the endless levels crawl up from the far horizon. A speck far down in the distance grew into the altitude of a garden plant, and, knowing what it must be, <b>I</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>my</b> heels home fiercely, waiting for what seemed hours until it should increase into a wind-dwarfed tree.|$|E
6000|$|And now all was over! Oh God, {{to think}} that my hopes should be {{shattered}} in so short a time, that the ship should be so soon tossed about in the storm, and the stars hidden by the clouds! And the past delight made the present darkness all the more bitter. I groaned. In my misery I uttered a prayer to God to help me. I could not think I should live henceforth. How could I go on existing with this aching void in my heart? I could not spend days and weeks and years always with this despair. It was too terrible to last. My reason told me that time would remedy it; but time was so long, and what misery must I go through before the wound was healed! And as I thought of what I had lost, my agony grew more unbearable. It grew vivid, and I felt Giulia in my arms. I panted as <b>I</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>my</b> lips against hers, and I said to her,-- ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> {{attempted}} to <b>press</b> <b>my</b> hands to my brow, which ached, and discovered they were tied together. This startled me very much. I brought {{them up to}} my mouth and felt the cold smoothness of metal. They were chained together. I tried to separate my legs and made out they were similarly fastened, and also that I was fastened to the ground by a much thicker chain about {{the middle of my}} body.|$|R
6000|$|Draw now the {{threefold}} knot firm on the ninefold bands, [...] And the Law that ye make {{shall be}} law after {{the rule of}} your lands. [...] This for the waxen Heath, and that for the Wattle-bloom, [...] This for the Maple-leaf, and that for the southern Broom. [...] The Law that ye make shall be law and <b>I</b> do not <b>press</b> <b>my</b> will, [...] Because ye are Sons of The Blood and call me Mother still.|$|R
5000|$|She revisits the {{landscape}} of the island and admits the need to revisit its beauty, but ultimately has returned for her brother. She speaks of the pains that accompanied her anxieties of leaving her brother and the years they have wasted being apart from each other when she writes,“I planned on telling youthat whenever <b>I</b> <b>pressed</b> seashells against <b>my</b> earit was never waves I would hearbut your boyhoodin a surge of laughterso loud and so clear it travelled all the way to America.” ...|$|R
