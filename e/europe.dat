5|$|Although Kennan {{regarded}} the Soviet Union as {{too weak to}} risk war, he nonetheless considered it an enemy capable of expanding into Western <b>Europe</b> through subversion, given the popular support for Communist parties in Western <b>Europe,</b> which remained demoralized by the devastation of the Second World War. To counter this potential source of Soviet influence, Kennan's solution was to direct economic aid and covert political help to Japan and Western <b>Europe</b> to revive Western governments and assist international capitalism; by doing so the United States would help to rebuild the balance of power. In June 1948, Kennan proposed covert assistance to left-wing parties not oriented toward Moscow and to labor unions in Western <b>Europe</b> in order to engineer a rift between Moscow and working-class movements in Western <b>Europe.</b>|$|E

5|$|As {{the only}} stable {{long-term}} state in <b>Europe</b> during the Middle Ages, Byzantium isolated Western <b>Europe</b> from newly emerging {{forces to the}} East.

From a different perspective, since the 7th century, the evolution and constant reshaping of the Byzantine state were {{directly related to the}} respective progress of Islam.|$|E

5|$|By the 16th century, when Japanese and European {{cultures}} met, fortification in <b>Europe</b> {{had moved}} beyond castles and relied on innovations {{such as the}} Italian trace italienne and star forts. Forts in India present a similar case; when they were encountered by the British in the 17thcentury, castles in <b>Europe</b> had generally fallen out of use militarily. Like shiro, the Indian forts, durga or durg in Sanskrit, shared features with castles in <b>Europe</b> such as acting as a domicile for a lord {{as well as being}} fortifications. They too developed differently from the structures known as castles that had their origins in <b>Europe.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{influences}} of Greece and Rome, most musical instruments in <b>Europe</b> during the Middles Ages came from Asia. The lyre is the only musical instrument {{that may have been}} invented in <b>Europe</b> until this period. Stringed instruments were prominent in Middle Age <b>Europe.</b> The central and northern regions used mainly lutes, stringed instruments with necks, while the southern region used lyres, which featured a two-armed body and a crossbar. Various harps served Central and Northern <b>Europe</b> as far north as Ireland, where the harp eventually became a national symbol. Lyres propagated through the same areas, as far east as Estonia.|$|E
