60|$|However, {{these three}} {{guardian}} angels had choice {{allies in the}} shape of the infernal company, who, as fast as the <b>Huguenots</b> <b>crossed</b> swords or shivered lances with their royal opponents, encircled them with their long black arms, and dragged them struggling away to Tartarus. Henry of Navarre yielded himself with a good-will to the horse-play with which this was performed, resisting just enough to give his demoniacal captors a good deal of trouble, while yielding all the time, and taking them by surprise by agile efforts, that showed that if he were excluded from Paradise it was only by his own consent, and that he heartily enjoyed the merriment. Most of his comrades, in especial the young Count de Rochefoucauld, entered into the sport with the same heartiness, but the Prince of Conde submitted to his fate with a gloomy, disgusted countenance, that added much to the general mirth; and Berenger, with Eustacie before his eyes, looking pale, distressed, and ill at ease, was a great deal too much in earnest. He had so veritable an impulse to leap forward and snatch her from that giddy revolving prison, that he struck against the sword of Monsieur with a hearty good-will. His silvered lath snapped in his hand, and at that moment he was seized round the waist, and, when his furious struggle was felt to be in earnest, he was pulled over on his back, while yells and shouts of discordant laughter rang round him, as demons pinioned him hand and foot.|$|R

The existing supporters were retained, but were differenced by adding a silver anchor to the coronet. The motto was [...] "Par foi et loyaute".|$|E
5000|$|Until recently, the <b>Huguenot</b> <b>cross</b> {{was not an}} {{official}} symbol of the Reformed Church of France. Rather it {{has served as a}} sign of popular recognition. The official logo of the former reformed churches was the [...] "burning bush". A new logo of the Reformed Church of France was adopted, a stylised representation of the burning bush with the <b>Huguenot</b> <b>cross</b> as an insert and the Latin phrase Flagror Non Consumor (I am burned, I am not consumed) taken from [...] "...and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed." ...|$|E

5000|$|It is {{sometimes}} {{asserted that the}} cross appeared {{for the first time}} during the Huguenot Wars (1562-1598) in the South of France. Bertrand Van Ruymbeke asserts instead that the <b>Huguenot</b> <b>cross</b> stands out as [...] "the most revealing" [...] of symbolic signs of latter-day Huguenot solidarity: [...] "Although a <b>Huguenot</b> <b>cross</b> was indeed designed in Nîmes in the 1680s, never was it in France the symbole de reconnaissance it later became for the descendants of the Huguenot refugees in the last third of the nineteenth century" [...] Van Ruymbeke identifies the late 19th-century Huguenot revival as sharing characteristics with two of historian Eric Hobsbawm's three categories of [...] "invented traditions": [...] A. [...] "those establishing or symbolizing social cohesion or the membership of groups, real or artificial communities", and B. [...] "those whose main purpose is socialization, the inculcation of beliefs, value systems and conventions of behavior." ...|$|E
