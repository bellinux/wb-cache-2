50|$|There {{are several}} {{advantages}} in using a <b>Double</b> <b>Block</b> <b>and</b> <b>Bleed</b> Valve. Significantly, {{because all the}} valve components are housed in a single unit, the space required for the installation is dramatically reduced thus freeing up room for other pieces of essential equipment.|$|E
50|$|Considering the {{operations}} and procedures executed before an operator can intervene, the <b>Double</b> <b>Block</b> <b>and</b> <b>Bleed</b> manifold offers further advantages over the traditional hook up. Due to {{the volume of}} the cavity between the two balls being so small, the operator is afforded the opportunity to evacuate this space efficiently thereby quickly establishing a safe working environment.|$|E
50|$|This design {{also has}} {{operational}} advantages, there are significantly fewer potential leak paths within the <b>double</b> <b>block</b> <b>and</b> <b>bleed</b> {{section of the}} pipeline. Because the valves are full bore with an uninterrupted flow orifice they have got a negligible pressure drop across the unit. The pipelines where these valves are installed can also be pigged without any problems.|$|E
50|$|A <b>block</b> <b>and</b> <b>bleed</b> {{manifold}} {{with one}} <b>block</b> valve <b>and</b> one <b>bleed</b> valve {{is also known}} as an isolation valve or <b>block</b> <b>and</b> <b>bleed</b> valve; a <b>block</b> <b>and</b> <b>bleed</b> manifold with multiple valves {{is also known as}} an isolation manifold. This valve is used in combustible gas trains in many industrial applications. <b>Block</b> <b>and</b> <b>bleed</b> needle valves are used in hydraulic and pneumatic systems because the needle valve allows for precise flow regulation when there is low flow in a non-hazardous environment.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] <b>Block</b> <b>and</b> <b>bleed</b> {{manifold}} is {{a hydraulic}} manifold that combines {{one or more}} block/isolate valves, usually ball valves, and one or more bleed/vent valves, usually ball or needle valves, into one component for interface with other components (pressure measurement transmitters, gauges, switches, etc.) of a hydraulic (fluid) system. The purpose of the <b>block</b> <b>and</b> <b>bleed</b> manifold is to isolate or block the flow of fluid in the system so the fluid from upstream of the manifold does not reach other components {{of the system that}} are downstream. Then they bleed off or vent the remaining fluid from the system on the downstream side of the manifold. For example, a <b>block</b> <b>and</b> <b>bleed</b> manifold would be used to stop the flow of fluids to some component, then vent the fluid from that component’s side of the manifold, in order to effect some kind of work (maintenance/repair/replacement) on that component.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the well known, two way shut off diaphragm valve, other types include: Three way zero deadleg valve, sterile access port, <b>block</b> <b>and</b> <b>bleed,</b> valbow <b>and</b> tank bottom valve.|$|R
50|$|This type of <b>Double</b> <b>Block</b> <b>and</b> <b>Bleed</b> Valves (DBB Valves) {{feature the}} {{traditional}} style of flange-by-flange type valve {{and is available}} with ANSI B16.5 flanges, hub connections and welded ends to suit the pipeline system {{it is to be}} installed in. It features all the benefits of the single unit DBB valve, with the added benefit of a bespoke face-to-face dimension if required.|$|E
50|$|This type of <b>Double</b> <b>Block</b> <b>and</b> <b>Bleed</b> Valves have a {{patented}} design which incorporates two {{ball valves}} and a bleed valve into one compact cartridge type unit with ANSI B16.5 tapped flanged connections. The major benefit of this design configuration {{is that the}} valve has the same face-to-face dimension as a single block ball valve (as specified in API 6D and ANSI B16.10), which means the valve can easily be installed into an existing pipeline {{without the need for}} any pipeline re-working.|$|E
50|$|These valves replace {{existing}} traditional techniques {{employed by}} pipeline engineers {{to generate a}} <b>double</b> <b>block</b> <b>and</b> <b>bleed</b> configuration in the pipeline. Two block valves and a bleed valve are as a unit, or manifold, to be installed for positive isolation. Used for critical process service, DBB valves are for high pressure systems or toxic/hazardous fluid processes. Applications that use DBB valves include instrument drain, chemical injection connection, chemical seal isolation, and gauge isolation. DBB valves {{do the work of}} three separate valves (2 isolations and 1 drain) and require less space and have less weight.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between the opponent block, i. e. the blockers starting points and the number of blockers, compared to the hitter chosen by the setter to attack in elite male volleyball competition. 4531 sequences were analyzed, corresponding to 97 sets, of 12 national male teams participating in the 2007 World Cup. In order to test the association between variables, descriptive and inferential statistics the chi-square test with analysis of the adjusted residual were used. Intra- and inter-observer reliability was assessed via the percentage error method. Results showed that the pinched <b>block</b> starting point <b>and</b> the <b>double</b> <b>block</b> final blocking action were the most recurrent ones and the opposite player (right side) was the most requested hitter. This study showed a significant association between the blockers starting points and the hitter chosen by the setter to finalize the play set. There was a downward trend in the attack from the middle hitter with pinched <b>block</b> <b>and</b> an upward trend in the attack of the opposite (right side) with mixed block (pinched zone 2). A significant association between hitter and number of blockers was also verified: middle hitters show a high tendency to attack facing individual block, opposite players (right side) usually attack vs. <b>double</b> <b>block</b> <b>and</b> left-side hitters usually face <b>double</b> <b>and</b> triple <b>block.</b> These results suggest that blockers starting points are taken in consideration by the opponent setter to create the best conditions for the hitters. Hence, the setter takes advantages of the specific features (skills and ability to score) of its hitters and the space where they perform the attack in order to create difficulties to the opponent block (i. e. middle hitters has a high trend to attack with individual block, opposite player with <b>double</b> <b>block</b> <b>and</b> left-side hitters with <b>double</b> <b>and</b> triple <b>block).</b> The present study shows that the volleyball game at the elite male level is characterized by a constant adaptation between setters options <b>and</b> the opponent <b>block</b> tactics <b>and</b> strategies. These trends must be considered in the training process to prepare hitters and blockers for the most common situations occurring in the competition and, therefore, to create better and more appropriated and effective solutions to the game problems. ...|$|R
40|$|On October 23, 2007, the {{operations}} team began a procedure {{to sample the}} Liquid Hydrogen (LH 2) storage vessels ("tanks"), and associated transfer system. This procedure was being performed to determine the conditions within the system, and if necessary, to purge the system of any excess Gaseous Hydrogen (GH 2) in preparation for reactivation of the system. The system had not been used since 2003. The LH 2 storage system contains two (2) spherical pressure vessels of 225, 000 gallons in volume, with a maximum working pressure (MAWP) of 50 psig. Eight inch transfer piping connects them to the usage point. Operations began with activation of the burnstack for the LH 2 storage area. Pneumatic (GN 2) systems in the storage area were then activated and checked. Pressurization of storage tank number 1 with gaseous nitrogen (GN 2) was initiated, with a target pressure of 10 psig, at which point samples were planned to be taken. At 5 psig, a loud noise was heard in the upper area of tank number 2. Smoke was seen exiting the burnstack and from the insulation on vent lines for both tanks. At this time tank number 1 was vented and the pressurization system was secured. The mishap resulted in physical damage to both storage tanks, {{as well as to}} some of the piping for both tanks. Corrective action included repair of the damaged hardware by a qualified contractor. Preventive action included documented organizational policy and procedures for establishing standby and mothball conditions for facilities and equipment, including provisions as detailed in the investigation report recommendations: Recommendation 1 : The using organization should define necessary activities in order to place hydrogen systems in long term periods of inactivity. The defined activities should address requirements for rendering inert, isolation (i. e., physical disconnect, <b>double</b> <b>block</b> <b>and</b> <b>bleed,</b> etc.) and periodic monitoring. Recommendation 2 : The using organization should develop a process to periodically monitor hazardous systems for proper configuration (i. e., a daily/weekly/monthly check sheet to verify critical purges are active) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{ripening}} of {{grape berry}} is generally regulated by abscisic acid (ABA), {{and has no}} relationship with ethylene function. However, functional interaction and synergism between ABA and ethylene during the beginning of grape berry ripening (véraison) has been found recently. Results The expressions of VvNCED 1 encoding 9 - cis -epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) and VvGT encoding ABA glucosyltransferase were all increased rapidly at the stage of véraison and reached the highest level at 9 th week after full bloom. However, VvCYP 1 encoding ABA 8 '-hydroxylase and VvβG 1 encoding berry β-glucosidase are different, whose expression peak appeared at the 10 th week after full bloom and in especial VvβG 1 remained {{at a high level}} till harvest. The VvACO 1 encoding 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC) oxidase, the VvETR 2 (ethylene response 2) and VvCTR 1 (constitutive triple response 1) had a transient expression peak at pre-véraison, while the VvEIN 4 (ethylene insensitive 4) expression gradually increased from the véraison to one week before harvest stage. The above mentioned changes happened again in the berry after harvest. At one week before véraison, <b>double</b> <b>block</b> treatment with NiCl 2 plus 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP) not only inhibited the release of ethylene and the expression of related genes but also suppressed the transcription of VvNCED 1 and the synthesis of ABA which all might result in inhibiting the fruit ripening onset. Treatment with ABA could relieve the <b>double</b> <b>block</b> <b>and</b> restore fruit ripening course. However, after harvest, <b>double</b> <b>block</b> treatment with NiCl 2 plus 1 -MCP could not suppress the transcription of VvNCED 1 and the accumulation of ABA, and also could not inhibit the start of fruit senescence. Conclusion The trace endogenous ethylene induces the transcription of VvNCED 1 and then the generation of ABA followed. Both ethylene and ABA are likely to be important and their interplaying may be required to start the process of berry ripening. When the level of ABA reached the peak value, part of it will be stored in the form of ABA-GE. While after harvest, abiotic stresses principally (such as dehydration, harvest shock) could induce the transcription of VvNCED 1 and the accumulation of ABA, thus starting the process of fruit senescence. </p...|$|R

The charge compensation mechanism induced {{by the introduction of}} iron atoms in the matrix of Sr 3 Ti 2 O 7 is sensitive to the conditions of synthesis, namely an oxidation process triggers the formation of mixed Fe(III) –Fe(IV) valences. The crystallographic characterization - variation of the cell parameters and structure calculations – brings evidence for the respective occurrence of mixed valences and oxygen vacancies which form in the middle plane of the <b>double</b> perovskite <b>block.</b> Ferromagnetic exchange interactions which are absent in the Fe(III) containing compositions, appear and progressively strengthen depending on the oxidizing treatment.

Treatment of parasynchronous cells by neuraminidase reduces the mobility to the same value irrespective of {{the stage of the}} cells in the mitotic cycle. The higher electrophoretic {{mobility of}} cells in mitotic peak phase is probably due to a higher surface charge density at this time, possibly caused by a higher concentration of ionized neuraminic acid carboxyl groups at the hydrodynamic shear layer. The mobility of nonsynchronous rapidly and slowly growing cells differs; neuraminidase reduces their mobility by proportionately similar amounts. The results suggest that the differences in mobility between rapidly and slowly growing cells cannot be accounted for exclusively by differences in the amount of neuraminic acid groups at the shear layer...|$|R
