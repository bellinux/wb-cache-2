40|$|Nondestructive {{chemical}} processing of porous samples such as fixed biological tissues typically relies on molecular diffusion. Diffusion into a porous structure {{is a slow}} process that significantly delays completion of {{chemical processing}}. Here, we present a novel electrokinetic method termed stochastic electrotransport for rapid nondestructive processing of porous samples. This method uses a rotational electric field to selectively disperse highly <b>electromobile</b> molecules throughout a porous sample without displacing the low-electromobility molecules that constitute the sample. Using computational models, we show that stochastic electrotransport can rapidly disperse <b>electromobile</b> molecules in a porous medium. We apply this method to completely clear mouse organs within 1 – 3 days and to stain them with nuclear dyes, proteins, and antibodies within 1 day. Our results demonstrate the potential of stochastic electrotransport to process large and dense tissue samples that were previously infeasible in time when relying on diffusion. Simons Foundation.
