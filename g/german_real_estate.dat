40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{increase}} {{the understanding of the}} performance implications for investors who choose to combine an unlisted <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> portfolio (in this case German Spezialfonds) with a (global) listed <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> element. We call this a “blended” approach to <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> allocations. For the avoidance of doubt, in this paper we are dealing purely with <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> equity (listed and unlisted) allocations, and do not incorporate <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> debt (listed or unlisted) or direct property into the process. A previous paper (Moss and Farrelly 2014) showed the benefits of the blended approach as it applied to UK Defined Contribution Pension Schemes. The catalyst for this paper has been the recent attention focused on German pension fund allocations, which have a relatively low (<b>real</b> <b>estate)</b> equity content, and a high bond content. We have used the MSCI Spezialfonds Index as a proxy for domestic <b>German</b> institutional <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> allocations, and the EPRA Global Developed Index as a proxy for a global listed <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> allocation.

40|$|Since 2008, the <b>German</b> {{open-ended}} <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> fund (GOEREF) {{industry has}} experienced a critical phase of suspensions of redemption of fund shares, announced fund terminations and, eventually, introduction of a new regulation. With assets under management of over EUR 80 billion, GOEREFs are the dominant indirect <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> investment vehicle in Germany. Thus, it is extremely important to {{study the effects of}} this crisis on the risk and return characteristics of the respective funds. Both net asset values (NAVs) and potential secondary market prices of the shares of funds with suspended redemptions are used. The resulting total return patterns are analysed on an index basis for fund groups that best represent the most important investor groups for GOEREFs. Groups that comprised a higher number of funds with suspended redemptions were considerably worse off and less attractive in an asset allocation context than the others given the often much lower secondary market prices. However, changes in return and risk must also be considered in terms of NAVs. The fund group comprising co-operative savings banks' funds was virtually unaffected by the liquidity crisis and continued to be deliver stable and non-volatile returns, while the other fund groups exhibited a clear shift in their respective return profiles...|$|R
