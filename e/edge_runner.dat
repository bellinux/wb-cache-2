40|$|The Sugar Industry, the Sugarcane Roller Mill and Sino-Portuguese Relations {{from the}} XVIth to XVIIIth Centuries. Many {{questions}} have been raised with respect to the origins of the rolling mill, type of sugarcane mill which by replacing the ancient technology of the <b>edge</b> <b>runner</b> and the beam presses in the xvnth century helped to speed up the process by which sugar cane is crushed and thus to favor the boom in the world sugar industry. This paper reexamines this question since it has come to light {{in the past few years}} that the promoters of this invention could be, in fact, the Chinese. A detailed comparison between the Chinese mill and the Brazilian mill shows, on the one hand, that the two machines are quite distinct and suggests, on the other hand, that problems with regard to technological innovation cannot be treated without taking into account the specific social context of each society. Thus for example in China, sugar, which has been produced long before it had in Europe, was not valued on the same basis as in Europe. Furthermore in China white sugar was not so much appreciated until the XVIth cen- tury. The evolution of its status seems linked to the pressures of the international market, after China had come into contact with her Asian neighbors via the Portuguese. At the end of the XVIth century, the Chinese sugar provinces of Guangdong and Fujian are going to produce very white sugar specially for exportation and if the clientele is rapidly satisfied it is because the Chinese possess technique for sugar whitening claying which the Portuguese will only introduce into the West later on. Between the xvith and xvnth century the Chinese sugar activity will experience an unprecedented development, but will rapidly lose energy, without resulting in more advanced stage of industrialisation. Traditional networks of production of artisanal and unrefined sugar meanwhile will continue to function. Sabban Françoise.

40|$|Mostly in multi {{disciplinary}} hydropower machines runner cavitations occur due to {{the operation}} in partial loads and running closer or below minimum operating level.

The experimental results showed that recirculation phenomena occur in two zones: the first close to the leading <b>edge</b> of the <b>runner,</b> the second downstream of the <b>runner</b> trailing <b>edge.</b> The appearance of backward flows is linked with a net exchange of torque which reduces the one transmitted by the fluid to the rotor and has a significant effect on the characteristic curves of the machine.

The recirculation upstream of the runner was detected by the fluid dynamic code more clearly when the conveyor vanes were inserted. Finally, the numerical results confirm the deviation of the internal characteristic from the line of the theoretical one due to the presence of recirculations...|$|R
40|$|New {{installations}} of unregulated {{power to}} the electrical grid have led to more fluctuations in the grid frequency. Hydropower plants with large reservoirs can provide services to balance the frequency by increasing or reducing production in accordance to what is needed. However, such balancing services are putting stress on the turbines by exposing them to dynamic loads. In the recent years, several high head Francis turbines have {{been taken out of}} operation due to cracks in the runner. It is thought to be because the turbines are not designed with sufficient measures to handle all the types of dynamic loads appearing during variations in operation. Analysis of stresses caused by fluid-structure interaction (FSI) is therefore of increasing interest in the hydropower industry. In this thesis, pressure and strain measurements have been performed on the Francis test rig in the Waterpower Laboratory at NTNU. The results were further used as validation of a FSI analysis conducted on the same turbine model in the software program ANSYS. The rotational speed of the runner was decreased by 60 rpm over a time period of 2 seconds to illustrate how an estimated change in grid frequency impact stresses in the turbine. The results from the FSI simulation showed high stresses both on the leading and trailing <b>edge</b> of the <b>runner</b> blades, where the maximum stress was found on the trailing edge tip towards the shroud. A decrease in runner speed resulted in a decrease in material stresses. At the end time, the maximum equivalent stress has a magnitude of 5 MPa, which is way below the yielding limit for the material. Validation of the CFD simulation showed sufficient correlation between the measured and simulated pressures. However, it was difficult to achieve a comparison of strain results with the strain gage, and the FSI results should therefore be further validated before they can be used as background for more research...|$|R
40|$|The {{deregulation}} of the energy market {{in the recent years}} has lead to an increased willingness to operate hydro turbines over a larger operational range and with increased number of start and stops. This means that the turbine will be subject to a more frequent and larger load variation. Especially for high head turbines, the impact of dynamic forces has been of considerable interest. High head turbine runners are subjected to dynamic forces originating from various sources. One significant source is the interaction between the runner and guide vanes, also called rotor - stator interaction (RSI). RSI creates periodic pressure fluctuations in the runner. Combined with stress concentration and material defects, the induced pressure fluctuations can give an increased risk of fatigue cracks. For Francis runners, the areas near the trailing <b>edge</b> of the <b>runner</b> blade towards the band and/or crown has been identified as critical areas for fatigue, and for high head runners there has been several examples where fatigue failure have been initiated near the trailing edge toward the band. The thesis presents an estimation of dynamic stresses in a high head Francis runner. The stresses were estimated by Finite Element analysis based on pressure variations obtained via unsteady CFD analysis. The dynamic stresses calculated by FEA were compared with dynamic stresses measured by strain gauge measurements carried out on a prototype runner. A CFD result for one operational condition was calculated. Since the pressure variations on the blades are periodic, only a pressure load for one whole cycle is needed for the FEA. Symmetry between the number of runner blades and guide vanes made it possible to reduce the computational model and thereby reduce computational time. The Finite Element model contained a portion of the crown and band and two runner blade channels. The FEA was carried out for time steps corresponding to a full periodic cycle for one operational condition, i. e one guide vane opening angles. The results were compared with site measurements.

40|$|The late University of Canterbury civil {{engineering}} lecturer Peter Giddens developed {{a range of}} simple microhydro turbines, with publications from {{as early as the}} 1980 s. He considered that a range of simple but well-designed turbines which covered the gamut of possible small sites would be more useful than any single turbine. He started with radial inflow turbines, then set about extending their range of applicability by increasing specific speed. That extension was continued by the research in this thesis, which aimed to produce a design with a minimum efficiency of 70 % at a specific speed of at least 600 (rev/min, kW, m). Achieving those targets would differentiate it from existing microhydro designs. In order to reach those performance targets, the volute, runner, and draft tube were examined through experiment and computational fluid dynamics models to characterize past designs and test the validity of their embodied assumptions. A prototype with a design specific speed of 650 was built and fully characterized by dynamometer testing. Measurements of the outlet velocity distribution of two of Peter Giddens’s volutes confirmed that single tangential inlet volutes are not torque-free when certain geometric conditions are met; swirl increased through those volutes by 70 % or more depending on the design. A new overall turbine design was proposed, where axial flow enters the runner and swirling flows leaves it. This required the design of a novel volute. Through computational analysis, the effect of swirling flow entering the conical draft tube was shown to affect its pressure recovery: negatively for draft tubes with small angles, positively for larger angles. It was shown that the peak pressure recovery of an optimum draft tube was not likely to be improved upon by the use of swirl, and since there was uncertainty in the analysis, a conservative draft tube was specified for the prototype. A flat-bladed runner was designed for the prototype and computational modeling indicated its performance would be sensitive to small changes in flow angle. Despite that sensitivity — an intrinsic property of high specific speed runner velocity triangles — the computational model was shown to give good predictions of the runner flow characteristics, although not its effciency. Finally, a 1. 2 kW prototype was built and achieved a peak net effciency of 64 % as defined by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers at a net head of 2. 07 m, a flowrate of 94 L/s, and a runner shaft speed of 1670 rev/min, corresponding to a specific speed of 740. Maximum measured runner efficiency of 87 % also occurred at those conditions. Compared to existing designs, that performance extended the operational envelope of microhydro turbines considerably. A three-zone computational model of the entire prototype was assembled and trialled, but not validated. It is concluded that for efficient high specific speed turbines, volute swirl characteristics must be known with confidence, as the volute sets the conditions at the leading <b>edge</b> for peak <b>runner</b> efficiency. A simple but efficient runner may be made using flat blades, showing the potential for this geometry even when made by limited workshops. Adding a free-vortex tangential velocity distribution to the inlet flow of a stalled conical draft tube may increase its pressure recovery, although it is not likely to exceed the best performance obtainable with axial inlet flow. Therefore taking measures to reduce the peak fluid velocity entering the draft tube could be more beneficial to overall performance than seeking outright improvements in draft tube pressure recovery...|$|R
40|$|The use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{has become}} a {{well-established}} approach in the analysis and optimisation of impulse hydro turbines. Recent {{studies have shown that}} modern CFD tools combined with faster computing processors can be used to accurately simulate the operation of impulse turbine runners and injectors in timescales suitable for design optimisation studies and which correlate well with experimental results. This work has however focussed mainly on Pelton turbines and the use of CFD in the analysis and optimisation of Turgo turbines is still in its infancy, with no studies showing a complete simulation of a Turgo runner capturing the torque on the inside and outside blade surfaces and producing a reliable extrapolation of the torque and power at a given operating point. Although there have been some studies carried out in the past where injector geometries (similar for both Pelton and Turgo turbines) have been modified to improve their performance, there has been no thorough investigation of the basic injector design parameters and the influence they have on the injector performance. The aim of this research is to use modern CFD tools to develop models which aid the better understanding of Turgo impulse turbine runners and injectors and facilitate the optimisation of existing designs. CFD is used to model and optimise both the injectors and the runner of a modern commercial Turgo impulse turbine and the accuracy of the models are verified by carrying out experimental tests on the original and optimised designs. The original designs together with experience in the operation of these turbines were provided by the industrial sponsors of this research Gilbert Gilkes and Gordon Ltd. The research described in this thesis can be split into five main parts: 1. Development of a numerical model to analyses the flow through the Turgo runner using modern CFD tools combined with a series of assumptions to reduce the computational time while still retaining the accuracy of the model. Using this model to optimise the design of the Turgo runner provided by Gilkes. 2. Development of a similar numerical model for a simplified 2 D injector design to facilitate a study {{of the impact of the}} basic design parameters on the performance over a range of operating conditions. Applying these optimisations to the existing Gilkes design and taking the numerical analysis further by including the full injector geometry as well as the branch pipe and guide vanes. 3. Manufacture and experimental testing of the original and optimised Turgo runners. 4. Manufacture and experimental testing of the original and optimised injector designs. 5. Verification of the numerical models developed in 1.) and 2.) by comparison with the experimental results. The numerical model developed in 1.) includes several simplifying assumptions in order to reduce the computational time and produce models which could solve in reasonable timescales allowing many design variations to be analysed. As the runner simulations require a transient analysis of complex multi-phase free surface flow with a rotating frame of reference they are already computationally costly and efforts have to be made to reduce this computational cost if the models are to be effective for optimisation purposes. The runner model simplifications were the exclusion of any casing interactions by not modelling the casing and the use of a 2 blade model analysing only a single blade passage in order to reduce the size of the computational domain. Several modelling assumptions were also introduced and attempts are made to quantify the effects of these assumptions through unit tests. For discretisation of the domain two mesh sizes were used, a coarse mesh which slightly under predicts the efficiency but was suitable for comparing designs and a fine mesh which gave mesh independent results. The fine mesh took over 4 times longer to solve rendering it unfeasible for optimisation purposes and it was therefore used only at key points to verify the design changes made using the coarse mesh. The analysis and optimisation of the injectors carried out in 2.) use similar CFD tools as the runner analysis however the geometry (excluding the branch pipe and guide vanes) could be simplified into a 2 D axisymmetric case operating at steady state conditions. This drastically reduces the solve time and allows the use of a mesh independent model and the analysis of hundreds of designs and operating conditions. Once the optimisations had been carried out, the design changes were verified by extending the model to analyse the 3 D case with a straight pipe upstream of the injector and a 3 D full case including the branch pipe and guide vanes. In 3.), following the optimisation of the runner in 1.), a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of the runner was carried out to ensure the optimised runner had sufficient strength for operation at the highest heads recommended for a runner of this size. The design was strengthened based on the results of the FEA and CFD was carried out in conjunction with these changes to ensure minimal loss in hydraulic efficiency. The manufacturing process was also researched and Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DFMA) was applied to the strengthened design identifying two optimised designs (LE 4 and LE 1) which will be tested before and after additional dressing of the leading <b>edges.</b> Both optimised <b>runner</b> designs were manufactured and tested at the Laboratory of Hydraulic Machines, National Technical University of Athens (NTUA). Following the injector analysis and optimisations in 2.), the optimised injectors were manufactured for experimental testing using both the Pelton and the Turgo test rig at NTUA in 4.). As the design changes made were not critical to the strength of the injectors there was no need to carry out a FEA. The CFD model verification in Part 5.) looks initially at the full Turgo system in order to compare the absolute difference between the numerical efficiency and the experimental efficiency of the original Turgo runner at the best efficiency point. The mechanical losses of the test rig are estimated to determine the experimental hydraulic efficiency. The numerical hydraulic efficiency is then determined by calculating the losses upstream of the injector, using standard pipe flow equations and combing these with the losses through the injector, as well as the numerical efficiency of the runner by simulating the runner using the ‘real jet’ profile produced by the full injector simulations. The results showed the numerical model to be over-predicting the efficiency by 1. 26 %. The numerical difference in the performance of the two injectors is then compared to the experimental difference measured during testing. This is done by importing the ‘real jet’ profiles produced by the full 3 D injector simulations into the LE 1 runner simulation. This allows the difference in total efficiency between the injectors combined with the runner to be compared to the experimental differences which also includes the impact of the jet on the runner performance. The comparison between the injectors is less accurate as more uncertainties are introduced when combining these models and the differences are smaller however the CFD was able to predict the improvements to within 0. 4 %. Finally, the numerical differences between the runner designs and the experimental differences are compared showing that the runner model is able to predict differences in hydraulic efficiency to within 0. 1 %. This accuracy is largely down to that fact that many of the systematic experimental and modelling errors are cancelled out when comparing only the runners. The CFD model verification has shown that although the absolute performance of the Turgo system can be modelled numerically to within a good degree of accuracy, it requires combining injector and runner models as well as estimating additional losses in the pipework which can prove time consuming. However for design comparison and optimisations the CFD models have been shown to be far more accurate suggesting that this is where these numerical models are most useful...|$|R
