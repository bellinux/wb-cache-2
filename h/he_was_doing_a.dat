5|$|In second practice, Hamilton {{was again}} quickest {{but was also}} caught out again. He went off at the turn ten hairpin and crashed his car while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> run on {{intermediate}} tyres in wet conditions– a downpour of rain affected {{the second half of}} the session. Most teams sent their drivers out only in the dry first half, setting times on the super-soft tyre compound. Ferrari looked to be significantly closer to Mercedes, with Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen finishing second and third respectively, less than 0.4 seconds behind Hamilton. Lotus confirmed their good pace from the first session when Pastor Maldonado was fifth fastest, behind Rosberg.|$|E

Mayor Kendrick reported to the press, [...] "I {{had the guts to}} bring General Butler to Philadelphia and I have the guts to fire him." [...] Feeling that his duties in Philadelphia were coming to an end, Butler contacted General Lejeune to prepare for his return to the Marine Corps. Not all of the city felt <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> bad job, though, and when the news started to break that he would be leaving, people began to gather at the Academy of Music. A group of 4,000 supporters assembled and negotiated a truce between him and the mayor to keep him in Philadelphia for a while longer, and the president authorized a one-year extension.|$|E

Len Wein joined the project as its editor, while Giordano stayed on to oversee it. Both Wein and Giordano stood back and [...] "got out of their way"; Giordano remarked later, [...] "Who copy-edits Alan Moore, for God's sake?" ...|$|E
500|$|In 1919, {{the matter}} went to {{consideration}} in Paris before the World War I Allies. Watt claims the Poles based their claims on ethnographical reasons and the Czechs based their need on the Teschen coal, useful {{in order to}} influence the actions of Austria and Hungary, whose capitals were fuelled by coal from the duchy. The Allies finally decided that the Czechs should get 60 percent of the coal fields and the Poles were to get {{most of the people}} and the strategic rail line. Watt writes: [...] "Czech envoy Edvard Beneš proposed a plebiscite. The Allies were shocked, arguing that the Czechs were bound to lose it. However, Beneš was insistent and a plebiscite was announced in September 1919. As it turned out, Beneš knew what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing.</b> <b>A</b> plebiscite would take some time to set up, and a lot could happen in that time – particularly when a nation's affairs were conducted as cleverly as were Czechoslovakia's." ...|$|E
500|$|Chandler and Phoebe had {{originally}} been written as more secondary characters who were just there to provide humor around the other four; Matthew Perry described Chandler in the pilot script as [...] "an observer of other people's lives". They had {{become part of the}} core group by the time casting concluded. Crane believed that the part of Chandler, described in the character breakdown as [...] "a droll, dry guy", would be the easiest to cast, though it proved more difficult than he initially hoped. Perry had previously worked with Kauffman and Crane on an episode of Dream On, and requested an audition when he identified with the character. He was turned down due to his involvement as a cast member in LAX 2194, a television pilot about airport baggage handlers in the future. After the producers of Friends saw LAX 2194, it became clear to them {{that it would not be}} picked up for a series, and Perry was granted an audition. He read for the role near the end of the casting period and got it in under a week. Before Perry was cast, Craig Bierko was first choice for the role. Bierko was a friend of Perry's, and Perry coached him for his audition to help him get to know what the Chandler character was like. Jon Cryer had also auditioned for the part. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> play in London and read for a British casting director, though his audition tape did not arrive at Warner Bros. in time for him to be considered.|$|E

500|$|The Seinfeld Chronicles {{featured}} four {{characters that}} {{were intended to}} be series regulars if the show was to be picked-up for a first season: Jerry, George, Kramer and Claire the waitress. Though it was already settled that Seinfeld would play a fictionalized version of himself, auditions were held for the other three characters. Though George was based on Larry David, David was keen on writing, {{and did not have}} the desire to portray the character himself. Prior to the casting progress, Seinfeld pleaded with his friend Jake Johannsen to play the part, but he rejected it. When the casting process started, as casting director Marc Hirschfeld stated, the casting crew [...] "saw every actor [...] could possibly see in Los Angeles". Among these actors were Larry Miller, Brad Hall, David Alan Grier, and Nathan Lane yet none of them seemed fit for the part. Jason Alexander auditioned for the part via a video tape, though he had very little hope for being cast, as he felt <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> Woody Allen impression. However, upon watching the tape, David and Seinfeld were immediately convinced Alexander would be the right actor to cast. However, traditionally casting sessions work with rounds, so Alexander and a few other actors considered for the role were flown to Los Angeles for a second audition. One of the other actors who made it to this round was Larry Miller. As Alexander knew Miller was a close friend of Seinfeld, he was convinced he would not get the part, but eventually did.|$|E

2500|$|The {{historian}} A. J. A. Morris {{claimed that}} this speech caused a sensation due to Roberts' warnings about Germany. It was much criticised by the Liberal and Radical press. The Manchester Guardian was disgusted at the [...] "insinuation that the German Government's views of international policy are less scrupulous and more cynical {{than those of}} other Governments...Prussia's character among nations is, in fact, not {{very different from the}} character which Lancashire men give to themselves as compared with other Englishmen.

The Nation claimed Roberts had an [...] "unimaginative soldier's brain" [...] and that Germany was [...] "a friendly Power" [...] who since 1870 [...] "has remained the most peaceful and the most self-contained, though doubtless not the most sympathetic, member of the European family". The historian John Terraine, writing in 1993, said: [...] "At this distance of time the verdict upon Lord Robert's Manchester speech must be that, in speaking out clearly on the probability of war, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> patriotic service comparable to Churchill's during the Thirties".|$|E
2500|$|By {{the spring}} of 1998, many in the media had taken to {{describing}} the Liberals under Chrétien as the [...] "couch potato party" [...] and the [...] "do-nothing party" [...] that did very little. Critics pointed {{out that in the}} 1997–98 session of Parliament, in which the Liberals held a majority, the main achievements of the government had to ratify tax treaties with Croatia and Algeria, allowing the government of Canada to exchange tax information concerning dual citizens who were Croat-Canadian and Algerian-Canadian with those two nations to club tax evasion. Chrétien for his part defending this record, arguing that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> fine job as a prime minister, and the Canadian people did not want major changes to their nation. [...] One of the few areas that the government was active on was national unity. In August 1998, the Supreme Court of Canada in the Reference re Secession of Quebec ruled in favor of the federal government's claim that an unilateral declaration of independence on the part of Quebec was illegal, that to leave Confederation would require Quebec to negotiate with the federal government, and that Quebec could only leave after achieving a settlement with Ottawa granting independence. This ruling created the legal background to the bill that became the Clarity Act.|$|E
2500|$|Gord {{has worked}} in his watch tower for more than {{eighteen}} years without a paycheck and claims {{to have been a}} forest ranger his entire life. His apparent reason for becoming a ranger was that he thought Smokey Bear was talking directly to him in one of his famous public service announcements ("Only you can prevent forest fires"). He frequently breaks out in tears during Red's visits as he talks about how lonely he is and/or how much of a sacrifice he makes at his job. During one visit, Gord claimed to have gotten so lonely that he ate the watch tower and then later moved on to another tower in season 7. Gord sometimes laments his lack of recognition. Once, he thought that someone had left him some honorary medallions only to learn from Red that they were beer bottle caps (Gord thought that a Budweiser cap was for being a [...] "bud of the forest"). On another occasion, Gord justified his lack of communication with his superiors as a sign that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> [...] "good job protecting the forest," [...] to which Red suggested that his superiors most likely forgot about him. In truth, it turned out that he had been dismissed many years ago, but the message had never reached him.|$|E

As he read about Anne Boleyn on the subsequent flight to Chicago, a theme he recorded in November 1971 ran through his mind which he wrote on some hand drawn ledger lines and played during the sound check and the subsequent concert. Said Wakeman, [...] "I had been searching for a style to write in and suddenly I found it in writing music about these six ladies...I would concentrate {{on one of the}} wives and then music just came into my head and I would write it down. Sometimes I was flying, other times I was on stage, or {{just in front of the}} piano at home ... The six wives theme gave me the thread, the link, I needed to give me a reason for putting these pieces of music together." [...] He explains the album's concept further in its liner notes: [...] "The album is based around my interpretations of the musical characteristics of the wives of Henry VIII. Although the style may not always be in keeping with their individual history, it is my personal conception of their characters in relation to keyboard instruments." [...] Wakeman elaborated and wrote the music as if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> surreal painting, [...] "sketches of how I felt about them at the time".|$|E
