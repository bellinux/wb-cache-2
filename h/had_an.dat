5|$|A {{study with}} an intent-to-treat {{prospective}} design {{was published in}} 1998 by a team from the Johns Hopkins Hospital and followed-up by a report published in 2001. As with most studies of the ketogenic diet, there was no control group (patients who did not receive the treatment). The study enrolled 150 children. After three months, 83% of them {{were still on the}} diet, 26% had experienced a good reduction in seizures, 31% had <b>had</b> <b>an</b> excellent reduction and 3% were seizure-free. At twelve months, 55% were still on the diet, 23% had a good response, 20% <b>had</b> <b>an</b> excellent response and 7% were seizure-free. Those who had discontinued the diet by this stage did so because it was ineffective, too restrictive or due to illness, and most of those who remained were benefiting from it. The percentage of those still on the diet at two, three and four years was 39%, 20% and 12% respectively. During this period the most common reason for discontinuing the diet was because the children had become seizure-free or significantly better. At four years, 16% of the original 150 children had a good reduction in seizure frequency, 14% <b>had</b> <b>an</b> excellent reduction and 13% were seizure-free, though these figures include many who were no longer on the diet. Those remaining on the diet after this duration were typically not seizure-free but had <b>had</b> <b>an</b> excellent response.|$|E
