5|$|In nonplanar surface embeddings {{the set of}} dual <b>edges</b> {{complementary}} to a {{spanning tree}} is not a dual spanning tree.

50|$|The fifth {{match was}} a hair vs. hair match between Kurt Angle and <b>Edge.</b> <b>Edge</b> {{attempted}} a spear on Angle, but Angle avoided the move, resulting in <b>Edge</b> performing a spear on the referee.

Angle performed an Angle Slam on <b>Edge</b> for a near-fall.

40|$|Abstract:- In this paper, {{we use the}} Hessian tensor in {{differential}} geometry for <b>edge</b> and corner detection. Most <b>edge</b> operators, such as Canny operator, detect <b>edge</b> centers and use gradient magnitude to represent <b>edge</b> strength. In this paper, for each <b>edge,</b> we detect three crucial elements, <b>edge</b> center, <b>edge</b> contrast, and <b>edge</b> span. Once the <b>edge</b> contrast and the <b>edge</b> span have been identified, they can be adjusted for different purposes, like contrast enhancement and sharpness enhancement. In addition, the Hessian tensor {{can be used to}} find corners, which are useful for feature selection and <b>edge</b> linking. Furthermore, based on detected <b>edge</b> elements, we also developed a hybrid method for image segmentation. Key-Words:- <b>Edge</b> Detection, corner detection, {{differential geometry}}, principal curvature, Hessian tensor, image Segmentation. ...|$|R
5|$|A {{connected}} component of an undirected graph is the subgraph {{consisting of the}} vertices and <b>edges</b> that {{can be reached by}} following <b>edges</b> from a single given starting vertex. A graph is connected if every vertex or edge is reachable from every other vertex or edge. A cycle in an undirected graph is a connected subgraph in which each vertex is incident to exactly two <b>edges,</b> or is a loop.|$|E
5|$|A cutset in an {{arbitrary}} connected graph is {{a subset of}} <b>edges</b> defined from a partition of the vertices into two subsets, by including an edge in the subset when it has one endpoint {{on each side of}} the partition. Removing the <b>edges</b> of a cutset necessarily splits the graph into at least two connected components. A minimal cutset (also called a bond) is a cutset with the property that every proper subset of the cutset is not itself a cut. A minimal cutset of a connected graph necessarily separates its graph into exactly two components, and consists of the set of <b>edges</b> that have one endpoint in each component. A simple cycle is a connected subgraph in which each vertex of the cycle is incident to exactly two <b>edges</b> of the cycle.|$|E
5|$|A {{directed}} acyclic graph may be used {{to represent}} a network of processing elements. In this representation, data enters a processing element through its incoming <b>edges</b> and leaves the element through its outgoing <b>edges.</b>|$|E
30|$|On {{the basis}} of the above formula theory, many {{algorithms}} are proposed. The commonly used <b>edge</b> detection methods are the Roberts <b>edge</b> detection operator, Sobel <b>edge</b> detection operator, Prewitt <b>edge</b> detection operator, Canny <b>edge</b> detection operator, Laplace <b>edge</b> detection operator, and so on. However, the traditional method of <b>edge</b> detection has some drawbacks in time and complexity, so this paper uses CA to detect the image <b>edge.</b>|$|R
30|$|For the {{augmented}} Krebs network, Fig.  21 {{shows that}} <b>edge</b> (16, 17) ranks highest for <b>edge</b> betweenness and ranks second for <b>Edge</b> Gravity. On the other hand, <b>edge</b> (4, 15) is the third-ranking <b>edge</b> according to <b>edge</b> betweenness but ranks only 25 th according to <b>Edge</b> Gravity. Similarly, <b>edge</b> (4, 7) ranks fourth for betweenness but ranks only 28 th {{with respect to}} <b>Edge</b> Gravity. Observe that node 7 is adjacent to a bridge to nowhere, the presence of which {{appears to have a}} boosting effect on <b>edge</b> betweenness for (4, 7).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Edge</b> {{preparation}} {{is a process}} to modify <b>edge</b> geometry and surface integrity of cutting tools. <b>Edge</b> preparation experiments of tungsten carbide cutting tools were carried out through an abrasive nylon brushing method. Tools wear and cutting temperatures with different <b>edge</b> radius were simulated with FEM software. The experimental results show that cutting <b>edge</b> defects were eliminated through brushing <b>edge</b> preparation. The <b>edge</b> radius has influences on cutting tool performance. When the <b>edge</b> radius is 20 µm, the least wear can be obtained. Then tool wear value increases with the <b>edge</b> radius. A suitable <b>edge</b> radius will have a reasonable cutting temperature distribution. The tool temperature distribution shows the same results as tool wear. A suitable <b>edge</b> radius range is needed for <b>edge</b> preparation and a reasonable <b>edge</b> radius is needed to improve tool life...|$|R
5|$|A graph {{is formed}} by a {{collection}} of vertices and <b>edges,</b> where the vertices are structureless objects that are connected in pairs by <b>edges.</b> In {{the case of a}} directed graph, each edge has an orientation, from one vertex to another vertex.|$|E
5|$|A polytree is a {{directed}} graph formed by orienting the <b>edges</b> {{of a free}} tree. Every polytree is a DAG. In particular, {{this is true of}} the arborescences formed by directing all <b>edges</b> outwards from the roots of a tree.|$|E
5|$|Almost every {{sufficiently}} sparse random graph is pseudoforest. That is, if c is {{a constant}} with 0 < c < 1/2, and Pc(n) is the probability that choosing uniformly at random among the n-vertex graphs with cn <b>edges</b> results in a pseudoforest, then Pc(n) tends to one in the limit for large n. However, for c > 1/2, almost every random graph with cn <b>edges</b> has a large component that is not unicyclic.|$|E

50|$|The event {{opened with}} <b>Edge</b> {{defending}} the World Heavyweight Championship against Dolph Ziggler, with the stipulation that <b>Edge</b> {{would lose the}} World Heavyweight Championship should he use the Spear. <b>Edge</b> applied the Edgecator on Ziggler but Ziggler touched the ring ropes, forcing <b>Edge</b> to break the hold. Ziggler performed a Leg Drop Bulldog on <b>Edge</b> for a near-fall. Ziggler applied a Sleeper Hold on <b>Edge</b> but <b>Edge</b> escaped and performed an Edgecution on Ziggler. <b>Edge</b> pinned Ziggler but Vickie Guerrero pulled the referee, voiding the pinfall at a two count. Whilst Kelly Kelly attacked Guerrero, Ziggler performed a Zig Zag on <b>Edge</b> for a near-fall.

5|$|Another {{parameter}} {{that measures}} {{the quality of}} a book embedding, beyond its number of pages, is its pagewidth.

5|$|Moving from {{individual}} graphs to graph families, if {{a family of}} graphs has the property that every subgraph of a graph in the family {{is also in the}} family, and every graph in the family has at most as many <b>edges</b> as vertices, then the family contains only pseudoforests. For instance, every subgraph of a thrackle (a graph drawn so that every pair of <b>edges</b> has one point of intersection) is also a thrackle, so Conway's conjecture that every thrackle has at most as many <b>edges</b> as vertices can be restated as saying that every thrackle is a pseudoforest. A more precise characterization is that, if the conjecture is true, then the thrackles are exactly the pseudoforests with no four-vertex cycle and at most one odd cycle.|$|E
5|$|The pseudoarboricity of a graph G {{is defined}} by analogy to the arboricity as the minimum number of pseudoforests into which its <b>edges</b> can be partitioned; equivalently, it is the minimum k such that G is (k,0)-sparse, or the minimum k such that the <b>edges</b> of G can be {{oriented}} to form a directed graph with outdegree at most k. Due to the matroid structure of pseudoforests, the pseudoarboricity may be computed in polynomial time.|$|E
5|$|Two-page book embeddings with a fixed {{partition}} of the <b>edges</b> into pages {{can be interpreted}} as a form of clustered planarity, in which the given graph must be drawn {{in such a way that}} parts of the graph (the two subsets of <b>edges)</b> are placed in the drawing in a way that reflects their clustering. Two-page book embedding has also been used to find simultaneous embeddings of graphs, in which two graphs are given on the same vertex set and one must find a placement for the vertices in which both graphs are drawn planarly with straight <b>edges.</b>|$|E
