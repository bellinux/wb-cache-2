5|$|By {{the time}} of his 1922 {{re-election}} bid, Barkley was the ranking Democrat on the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee.

Libbey, the establishment of such an organization, and not necessarily a desire to become governor, may have motivated him to announce his candidacy <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> gubernatorial nomination on November 11, 1922. Critics charged that this was his intent, and he did little to deny it.|$|E
