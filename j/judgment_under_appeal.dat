40|$|The {{principle}} no reformatio in peius (prohibition of reformation in peius {{means that}} a person should not {{be placed in a}} worse position as a result of filling an appeal) should be respected both in the trial of the remedy at law and the retrial of the case, after the invalidation or the repeal of the judgment, because the retrial is the consequence of the exercise of the challenge methods, and the party must have the certainty that its situation will not be deteriorated, not only in the filling of the appeal promoted but also in the preproceeding process subsequent to the admission of the appeal. Thus the principle no reformatio in peius is adjusted under the article 481 from the Code of Civil Procedure, it can't create for the appellant a worse situation that the one before the <b>judgment</b> <b>under</b> <b>appeal,</b> besides if he expressly consents to this one or in the cases specifically provided by law. ...|$|E
40|$|From the Introduction. This article {{seeks to}} examine the {{relationship}} between European Union law, international law, and the protection of fundamental rights in the light of recent case law of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and the Court of First Instance (CFI) relating to economic sanctions against individuals. On 3 September 2008, the ECJ delivered its long-awaited judgment in Kadi and Al Barakaat on appeal from the CFI. 3 In its <b>judgment</b> <b>under</b> <b>appeal,</b> 4 the CFI had held that the European Community (EC) is competent to adopt regulations imposing economic sanctions against private organisations in pursuance of UN Security Council (UNSC) Resolutions seeking to combat terrorism; that although the EC is not bound directly by the UN Charter, it is bound pursuant to the EC Treaty to respect international law and give effect to UNSC; and that the CFI has jurisdiction {{to examine the}} compatibility of EC regulations implementing UNSC resolutions with fundamental rights not as protected by the EC but as protected by jus cogens. On appeal, following the Opinion of Maduro AG, the ECJ rejected the CFI’s approach. It held that UNSC resolutions are binding only in international law. It subjected the contested regulations to full review under EC human rights standards and found them in breach of the right to a hearing, the right to judicial protection and the right to property. Kadi and Al Barakaat is the most important judgment ever delivered by the ECJ on the relationship between EC and international law and one of its most important judgments on fundamental rights. It is imbued by constitutional confidence, commitment to the rule of law but also some scepticism towards international law. In the meantime, the CFI has delivered a number of other judgments on anti-terrorist sanctions assessing the limits of the “emergency constitution” at European level. The purpose of this paper is to examine the above case law and explore the dilemmas and tensions facing the EU judiciary in seeking to define and protect the EU’s distinct constitutional space. It is divided as follows. It first looks at the judgment in Kadi. After a short presentation of the factual and legal background, it explores the question whether the EU has competence to adopt smart sanctions. It then examines whether the EU is bound by resolutions of the Security Council, whether the ECJ has jurisdiction to review Community measures implementing such resolutions and the applicable standard of judicial scrutiny. It analyses the contrasting views of the CFI, the Advocate General, and the ECJ taking account also of the case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). Further, it explores the consequences of annulling the contested regulation. It then turns to discussing CFI case law in relation to sanctions lists drawn up not by the UN Security Council but by the EC. The paper concludes by welcoming the judgment of the ECJ. Whilst its reasoning on the issue of Community competence is questionable, once such competence is established, it is difficult to support the abrogation of Community standards for the protection of fundamental rights. Such standards should ensure procedural due process whilst recognising the importance of public security...|$|E

40|$|An {{appeal is}} a {{substantive}} right created by statute enabling {{a party to}} seek to set aside or vary an order. The conferring statute determines the nature of an appeal, which typically falls into one of three types: appeals by way of rehearing, appeals by way of hearing de novo and strict appeals (stricto sensu). Australian court systems have multiple levels of jurisdiction. Each level, {{with the exception of}} the High Court, generally has an avenue of appeal. The scope and nature of the appeal depends upon the terms of the statute creating the right of appeal. Appellate courts have wide powers to affirm, vary, or reverse <b>judgments</b> <b>under</b> <b>appeal.</b> Other powers include sending a case back for a retrial, setting aside jury verdicts, and granting a retrial. Appeals are commenced by a notice of appeal, which briefly states the grounds of the appeal. In some cases leave to appeal is required. The appeal court will require the appellant to prepare an appeal book or record, including pleadings, affidavits, orders and transcripts of evidence. Appeals may also have related applications. Examples include seeking a stay of execution pending an appeal, security for costs, leave to appeal and an application for an extension of time in which to file or serve a notice of appeal. There are many substantive bases upon which appeals are brought. The most common include errors of law, errors in the exercise of a discretion, incorrect findings of fact, incorrect inferences drawn from facts, excessive or insufficient assessments of damages and misdirection of a jury by a trial judge. Considerable difficulty arises in relation to the admission of fresh evidence available at trial, and to a lesser extent where a new point arises after judgment. New points and objections may also arise before judgment. Appellate courts have the power to grant a new trial where there has been a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. New trials tend to be avoided due to the duplication of costs incurred in rehearing the evidence. Appeals are an essential process for ensuring consistency and maintaining the high quality of the Australian judicial system...|$|R

40|$|The {{categorization}} of inductive reasoning into largely automatic processes (heuristic reasoning) and controlled analytical processes (rule-based reasoning) {{put forward by}} dual-process approaches of <b>judgment</b> <b>under</b> uncertainty (e. g., K. E. Stanovich & R. F. West, 2000) has been primarily a matter of assumption with a scarcity of direct empirical findings supporting it. The present authors use the process dissociation procedure (L. L. Jacoby, 1991) to provide convergent evidence validating a dual-process perspective to <b>judgment</b> <b>under</b> uncertainty based on the independent contributions of heuristic and rule-based reasoning. Process dissociations based on experimental manipulation of variables were derived from the most relevant theoretical properties typically used to contrast the two forms of reasoning. These include processing goals (Experiment 1), cognitive resources (Experiment 2), priming (Experiment 3), and formal training (Experiment 4); the results consistently support the author's perspective. They conclude that <b>judgment</b> <b>under</b> uncertainty is neither an automatic nor a controlled process but that it reflects both processes, with each making independent contributions.

30|$|These {{arguments}} of Arendt—about Eichmann’s flawed judgment, about judgment’s mass breakdown in Nazi Germany, about Nazism’s aggressive assault on human community and Western morality—have momentous implications regarding {{the operation of}} <b>judgment</b> <b>under</b> Nazism. This unprecedented state of exception, Arendt suggests, brought down the two main pillars of judgment: given general moral principles and human community. It thereby made judgment’s failure on a mass scale an all too expected—a borderline inevitable—phenomenon. In this situation, only examples could conceivably have served as props of judgment. But even this possibility and hope does not refute the factual reality, as presented by Arendt in Origins and Eichmann, that Nazism imperiled profoundly the ability to judge. While not downright impossible, a survival of <b>judgment</b> <b>under</b> these conditions would be highly surprising.|$|R
