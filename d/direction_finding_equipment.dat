50|$|Both the British and German {{interception}} services {{began to}} experiment with <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> radio <b>equipment</b> {{at the start of}} 1915. Captain H. J.

Some of these stations also acted as 'Y' stations to collect German messages, but a new section was created within Room 40 to plot the positions of ships from the directional reports. No attempts were made by the German fleet to restrict its use of wireless until 1917, and then only in response to perceived British use of <b>direction</b> <b>finding,</b> not because it believed messages were being decoded.|$|R
25|$|Armstrong invented his {{receiver}} as a {{means of}} overcoming the deficiencies of early vacuum tube triodes used as high-frequency amplifiers in radio <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> <b>equipment.</b> Unlike simple radio communication, which only needs to make transmitted signals audible, direction-finders measure the received signal strength, which necessitates linear amplification of the actual carrier wave.|$|E
25|$|Koninklijke Maatschappij De Schelde built Slamat in Vlissingen on the River Scheldt, {{completing}} her in 1924.

50|$|The {{fourteen}} Clemson-class destroyers of Destroyer Squadron Eleven were {{to follow}} the flagship USS Delphy in column formation from San Francisco Bay, through the Santa Barbara Channel, and finally to San Diego. Destroyer Squadron Eleven was on a twenty-four-hour exercise from northern California to southern California. The flagship was responsible for navigation. As the USS Delphy steamed along the coastline, poor visibility meant the navigators had to go by the age-old technique of dead reckoning. They had to estimate their position based on their speed and heading. The navigators aboard USS Delphy did have radio <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> (RDF) <b>equipment,</b> which picked up signals from a station at Point Arguello, but RDF was new and the bearings obtained were dismissed as unreliable. Based solely on dead reckoning, Captain Watson ordered the fleet to turn east into the Santa Barbara Channel. However, the Delphy was actually several miles northeast of where they thought they were, and the error caused the ships to run aground on Honda Point.|$|R

5000|$|The {{existing}} {{design was}} adapted {{to produce a}} new airship based on the German craft and two examples were ordered, one (R33) to be constructed by Armstrong-Whitworth at Barlow, North Yorkshire, and the other (R34) by William Beardmore and Company in Inchinnan, Renfrewshire, Scotland. Assembly began in 1918. The R33 class was semi-streamlined fore and aft, the middle section being straight-sided. The control car was well forward on the ship, with the aft section containing an engine in a separate structure to stop vibrations affecting the sensitive radio <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> and communication <b>equipment.</b> The small gap was faired over, so the gondola {{seemed to be a}} single structure. [...] It was powered by five [...] Sunbeam Maori engines, with one in the aft section of the control car, two more in a pair of power cars amidships each driving a pusher propeller via a reversing gearbox for manoeuvering while mooring, and the remaining two in a centrally mounted aft car, geared together to drive a single pusher propeller.|$|R
25|$|To {{prevent their}} camp being located or {{compromised}} by German radio <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> <b>equipment</b> or informers, Tonkin regularly moved its location. The location of new camps {{had to be}} close to water and a drop zone for parachute supply. The camp located near to VerriÃ¨res was near to their drop zone at La Font d'Usson and had an adequate water supply. The SAS Squadron had been at VerriÃ¨res between 25 June and 1 July. The local population had also become aware of the camp and Tonkin was warned by Maingard that if the locals knew, informers would soon tell the Germans. Tonkin ordered the squadron to move to a new camp just south in the Bois des Cartes. This new camp was also close to their drop zone at La Font d'Usson where they were expecting a supply drop over the night of 3/4 July. On their arrival at the new camp at Bois des Cartes, the water supply from the well failed and due to this Tonkin decided to return to VerriÃ¨res until a more suitable camp site could be found.|$|E

30|$|<b>Direction</b> <b>finding</b> is a {{major issue}} of {{interest}} in array signal processing for MIMO radar. In this context, this issue has drawn attention from researchers in recent years.

40|$|A radio <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> (DF) {{system is}} an antenna array and a {{receiver}} {{arranged in a}} combination to determine the azimuth angle of a distant emitter. Basically, all DF systems derive the emitter location from an initial determination of the angle-of-arrival (AOA). Radio <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> techniques have classically been based on multiple-antenna systems employing multiple receivers. Classic techniques such as MUSIC [1][2] and ESPRIT use simultaneous phase information from each antenna to estimate the angle-of-arrival of the signal of interest. In many scenarios (e. g., hand-held systems), however, multiple receivers are impractical. Thus, single channel techniques are of interest, particularly in mobile scenarios. Although the amount of existing research for single channel DF is considerably less than for multi-channel <b>direction</b> <b>finding,</b> single channel <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> techniques have been previously investigated. Since many of the single channel <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> techniques are older analog techniques and have been analyzed in previous work, we will investigate a new single channel <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> technique that takes specific advantage of digital capabilities.

2500|$|Mobile {{transmitter}} hunts {{are organized}} events where participants travel exclusively or primarily in motor vehicles. [...] Most mobile transmitter hunts use VHF transmitters and receivers.

[...] Some mobile transmitter hunts require participants to leave their vehicles and proceed on foot to reach the actual location of the radio transmitter.

2500|$|As Commandant {{during the}} Prohibition Era, Billard {{established}} the Coast Guard's first intelligence center, designed to collect, evaluate, and disseminate {{information relating to}} smuggling practices and plans. The use of radio codes increased by both the service and the smugglers so the Coast Guard had to develop cryptanalysis skills to keep ahead of the smugglers. [...] Radio <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> <b>equipment</b> was installed on several Coast Guard vessels in late 1930. The original twenty destroyers were ending their expected service lives by 1930 and were replaced by newer craft that had been requested in 1926. Billard first used borrowed Navy aircraft in 1925 to track smugglers; this proved successful and in his 1926 budget requests he included the need for five aircraft {{at a cost of}} $152,000. With each improvement in detection and method of interdiction that the Coast Guard introduced, the smugglers would always find a different method of introducing contraband into the United States. Billard was concerned that Coast Guardsmen would succumb to enticements offered by the rum runners through either offers of liquor or cash, and there were several instances of this happening. Some service personnel were convicted at courts-martial of accepting bribes or improperly assisting liquor smugglers.|$|E
