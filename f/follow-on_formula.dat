40|$|The European Commission {{requested}} EFSA {{to review}} the former EFSA/BIOHAZ opinion on microbiological risks in infant <b>formulae</b> and <b>follow-on</b> <b>formulae.</b> Particularly it was requested to provide a scientific opinion on the possible correlation between Enterobacteriaceae and Enterobacter sakazakii and Enterobacteriaceae and Salmonella in infant formulae {{as well as on}} the correlation between Enterobacteriaceae and Salmonella in <b>follow-on</b> <b>formulae,</b> in the light of new scientific data. The usefulness of Enterobacteriaceae as indicators for E. sakazakiiand Salmonella in powdered infant <b>formulae</b> and <b>follow-on</b> <b>formulae</b> was also requested if available scientific data do not indicate a clear correlation. The products of concern are powdered infant <b>formulae</b> and powdered <b>follow-on</b> <b>formulae.</b> Consideration of microbiological criteria is outside of the remit of this opinion. Enterobacter sakazakii and Salmonella, both in the family Enterobacteriaceae, are hazards that are occasionally present in powdered infant <b>formulae</b> and powdered <b>follow-on</b> <b>formulae.</b> Given that Salmonella and E. sakazakii are both members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, there is some relationship between the presence of E. sakazakii and Salmonella and the presence of Enterobacteriaceae. If E. sakazakii or Salmonella are present, Enterobacteriaceae should be found provided that the methods are equally sensitive. In some instances levels are so low that if E. sakazakii or Salmonella is detected, Enterobacteriaceae are not detected, just due to “chance”. However, the reverse is not inevitably true since the presence of Enterobacteriaceae does not necessarily mean the presence of Salmonella or E. sakazakii. Industry data from different companies showed that E. sakazakii / Enterobacteriaceae ratios range from 9 to 30 %. A correlation between the prevalences of Enterobacteriaceae and that of E. sakazakii was observed in one plant but sufficient specific information was not available for the other plants. A correlation might be apparent according to the ecology of industrial units, with each unit having a characteristic ratio. The BIOHAZ Panel concluded that there is a relationship between the presence of Enterobacteriaceae and E. sakazakii in powdered infant formulae. No universal correlation can be established. There are indications that correlations could be established at individual plant level. It is not possible to establish a correlation between Enterobacteriaceae and Salmonella in infant <b>formulae</b> and in <b>follow-on</b> <b>formulae</b> and, because Salmonella is so rarely present, suitable data are not available. Industrial experience indicates that monitoring Enterobacteriaceae in the processing environment and in the product can be used to confirm the application of GMP/GHP and HACCP and would be expected to reduce the prevalence of E. sakazakii. The BIOHAZ Panel recommended that documented data ideally using standardized methods be accumulated (by industry, regulators, academia) testing for Enterobacteriaceae, Salmonella, and E. sakazakii in the same samples (ingredients, end-product and environmental) across the industry to explore correlations and their relevance in setting control measure...|$|R

However, by 12 months of age, 31 % of the cows' milk group were anaemic (haemoglobin concentration < 110 g/l) compared with only 3 % of those receiving follow-on formulas. At 18 months, 33 % of the cows' milk group were anaemic compared with only 2 % of the <b>follow-on</b> <b>formula</b> group and by 24 months of age none of the <b>follow-on</b> <b>formula</b> group was anaemic, whereas 26 % in the cows' milk group still had a haemoglobin of < 110 g/l.

Extraction of iodine was achieved with chloroform via the classical redox reaction with 10 % NaNO 3 and 2. 5 M H 2 SO 4. The chemical yield of the procedure for each sample aliquot was determined spectrophotometrically.

Model systems containing similar components and proportions to those normally found in manufactured samples and a mixture of high-oleic sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, and fish oil were used to obtain a fatty acid composition profile in accordance with the EU regulations. For comparative purposes, some samples were prepared with high-oleic sunflower or fish oil and others without the protein components and added Tween- 20. Quantification of total oxidized TAGs provided complete information of the oxidation state and showed clear advantages versus the other methods used, i. e., loss of PUFA and peroxide value. The results showed that the heat treatment used for sterilization did not lead to significant lipid oxidation, but the tocopherol concentration decreased significantly.

40|$|Arachidonic acid (ARA, 20 : 4 n- 6) is an n- 6 {{polyunsaturated}} 20 -carbon {{fatty acid}} {{formed by the}} biosynthesis from linoleic acid (LA, 18 : 2 n- 6). This review considers the essential role that ARA plays in infant development. ARA is always present in human milk at a relatively fixed level and is accumulated in tissues throughout the body where it serves several important functions. Without the provision of preformed ARA in human milk or infant formula the growing infant cannot maintain ARA levels from synthetic pathways alone that are sufficient to meet metabolic demand. During late infancy and early childhood the amount of dietary ARA provided by solid foods is low. ARA serves as a precursor to leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and thromboxanes, collectively known as eicosanoids which are important for immunity and immune response. There is strong evidence based on animal and human studies that ARA is critical for infant growth, brain development, and health. These studies also demonstrate the importance of balancing the amounts of ARA and DHA as too much DHA may suppress the benefits provided by ARA. Both ARA and DHA {{have been added to}} infant <b>formulas</b> and <b>follow-on</b> <b>formulas</b> for more than two decades.

Secondary objectives were the effects on stool characteristics, growth, and general well-being. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: In a multicenter, double-blind study, 159 healthy infants, formula-fed at enrollment (at 4 - 6 months), were randomized to an experimental <b>follow-on</b> <b>formula</b> supplemented with 5 g/L (GOS) (77 infants), or to a standard <b>follow-on</b> <b>formula</b> (control, 82 infants). Infants were evaluated at enrollment (study day 1 = sd 1), after 6 weeks (study day 2 = sd 2), and after an additional 12 weeks (study day 3 = sd 3). At each study day, a fresh stool sample for the bacterial counts was collected, and the growth parameters were measured. At sd 2, urinary specimens were collected for the evaluation of urinary osmolarity. RESULTS: At sd 2 and sd 3, the GOS group had a higher median number (colony-forming units per gram of stool) of bifidobacteria than did the control group (sd 2 GOS 9. 2 x 10 (9) vs control 4. 4 x 10 (9), P = 0. 012); (sd 3 GOS 7. 2 x 10 (9) vs control 2. 4 x 10 (9), P = 0. 027). Other bacteria did not show any significant differences between the 2 groups at all study days. The GOS produced softer stools but had no effect on stool frequency. The urinary osmolarity (mOsm/L) at sd 2 was comparable in both groups. Supplementation had no influence on the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects or on the growth of the infants.

The percentages less suitable for feeding in general were observed for use of cow's milk and added sugar, chocolate and cereal in feeding bottles; 79 % and 80. 5 % of the families interviewed would adopted such practices. Conclusion: the early termination of exclusive/predominant breastfeeding {{and the practice of}} an inadequate transition diet have shown a picture of quantitatively and qualitatively inadequate feeding, with the risk of causing serious nutritional problems in later ages, such as anemia and vitamin A deficiency, or excess of nutrients, leading to obesity, diabetes and dyslipidemias...|$|R
40|$|Vitamin A (retinol) {{fulfills}} multiple {{functions in}} vision, cell growth and differentiation, embryogenesis, {{the maintenance of}} epithelial barriers and immunity. A large number of enzymes, binding proteins and receptors facilitate its intestinal absorption, hepatic storage, secretion, and distribution to target cells. In addition to the preformed retinol of animal origin, some fruits and vegetables are rich in carotenoids with provitamin A precursors such as β-carotene: 6 μg of β-carotene corresponds to 1 μg retinol equivalent (RE). Carotenoids never cause hypervitaminosis A. Determination of liver retinol concentration, the most reliable marker of vitamin A status, cannot be used in practice. Despite its lack of sensitivity and specificity, the concentration of retinol in blood is used to assess vitamin A status. A blood vitamin A concentration below 0. 70 μmol/L (200 μg/L) indicates insufficient intake. Levels above 1. 05 μmol/L (300 μg/L) indicate an adequate vitamin A status. The recommended dietary intake increases from 250 μg RE/day between 7 and 36  months of age to 750 μg RE/day between 15 and 17  years of age, which is usually adequate in industrialized countries. However, intakes often exceed the recommended intake, or even the upper limit (600 μg/day), in some non-breastfed infants. The new European regulation on infant and <b>follow-on</b> <b>formulas</b> (2015) will likely limit this excessive intake. In some developing countries, vitamin A deficiency {{is one of the}} main causes of blindness and remains a major public health problem. The impact of vitamin A deficiency on mortality was not confirmed by the most recent studies. Periodic supplementation with high doses of vitamin A is currently questioned and food diversification, fortification or low-dose regular supplementation seem preferable...|$|R
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on the safety and suitability for use by infants of <b>follow-on</b> <b>formulae</b> (FOF) based on cow's milk intact protein with a protein content of at least 1. 6 g/ 100 kcal (rounded value) that meet otherwise the requirements of relevant EU legislation. If the formula under evaluation {{is considered to be}} safe and suitable for use by infants, the NDA Panel is also asked to advise on whether FOF based on goat's milk intact protein, soy protein isolates or protein hydrolysates are also safe and suitable for infants under the same conditions. The Panel concludes that the use of FOF with a protein content of at least 1. 6 g/ 100 kcal from either intact cow's milk protein or intact goat's milk protein otherwise complying with the requirements of relevant EU legislation is safe and suitable for healthy infants living in Europe with an intake of complementary foods of a sufficient quality. This conclusion does not apply to infant formula (IF). The Panel also concludes that the safety and suitability of FOF with a protein content of at least 1. 6 g/ 100 kcal manufactured from either protein hydrolysates or soy protein isolates cannot be established with the available data. The same conclusion applies to IF. The NDA Panel endorsed a draft of this scientific opinion on 14 December 2016 for public consultation. The draft document has been revised and updated according to the comments received, where appropriate. (C) 2017 European Food Safety Authority.
