30|$|I-beams flanged with veneer strands with medium density {{fiberboard}} (MDF) or particleboard as web material {{were produced}} by hot pressing. The <b>forming</b> <b>and</b> <b>pressing</b> method used a special metallic mould that allowed flanges to be formed and bonded to the web at the same time. Many I-beams were able to be produced in a single hot pressing cycle and this method allows the utilization of residues and wastes from wood and wood-composite industries. The <b>forming</b> <b>and</b> <b>pressing</b> method {{was found to be}} technically suitable for the production of such I-beams. The fundamental properties of the specimens produced were assessed and the results indicated that the I-beams had promising mechanical properties; for example, the modulus of rupture ranged from 40 to 56 [*]MPa depending on the flange density. The bond quality between the web and flange was found to have a critical effect on the strength of the entire I-beam. The I-beams were found to have relatively high bond strengths between the web and flange, ranging from 3.3 to 5.0 [*]MPa in the parallel direction. The dimensional stability of the I-beams was found to be excellent in the thickness direction of the beam, but not in the compression (width) direction.|$|E
40|$|Metal forming is {{a process}} which is done by {{deforming}} metal work pieces to the desired shape and size using pressing or hammering action. Hydraulic presses are being used for <b>forming</b> <b>and</b> <b>pressing</b> operations with wide range of capacities. Hydraulic press machine works under continuous impact load.

40|$|Thermal drying of a pulp {{sheet on}} a paper machine {{is one of the}} most {{energy-intensive}} operations in the paper-making process (Ghosh, 2011). The drying section of a paper machine removes less than 20 % of the total water eliminated from the wet sheet, but is responsible for 78 % of the energy consumption of the paper machine (Karlsson, 2009 & Biermann, 1996). Any enhancement of the dewatering of the paper sheet in the <b>forming</b> <b>and</b> <b>pressing</b> sections, thereby sending a sheet of lower moisture content to the drying section, would result in significant energy savings in the drying of the paper. Typically, the Canadian Standard Freeness (or freeness) and the Water Retention Value (WRV) of pulp are used as a measurement for the dewatering ability of pulp on the wire of the paper machine (Hubbe, 2007). However, neither of these measurements was designed to predict the water removed from the wet sheet (TAPPI T 227, 1999, Scallan & Carles, 1972). The factors that influence the dewatering of pulp on the forming fabric and in the pressing section of a paper machine have been the subject of many studies (Hubbe, 2007). The first objective of the current study was to compile a literature review to build an dewatering of the pulp sheet. Pliable fibres may conform to each other, resulting in a sealing effect that inhibits drainage. Mechanical and enzymatic refining may induce external and internal fibrillation of fibres, and the generation of fines in the pulp. Treating the pulp with an enzyme, specifically endoglucanase, may enhance the susceptibility of the fibres to development by mechanical refining. In the current study, the dewatering of pulp was analysed at pilot scale in order to test which pulp measurements best predicted its <b>forming</b> <b>and</b> <b>pressing</b> performance. A hardwood pulp, composed of Eucalyptus grandis, was refined in a pilot refiner and yielded samples over a range of refining energies. The conventional dewatering measurements, freeness and WRV, were performed on the pulp samples and related to the dewatering performance of the handsheets produced therefrom. The formability (water removed during forming) and pressibility (water removed during pressing) of the handsheets were also determined, and compared to the freeness and WRV of the pulps. It was found that the formability of a handsheet was a much stronger predictor of its dewatering performance than either the freeness or WRV of the pulp. Formability was likely the best predictor of handsheet dewatering because it was a direct measurement of the dewatering performance of a sheet on the forming fabric, whereas freeness and WRV both measured the dewatering of a thicker pad of pulp. The effect of the refining of pulp with an enzyme additive on its dewatering properties was also studied at pilot scale. An endoglucanase was incubated with a hardwood pulp, composed primarily of Eucalyptus grandis, and refined in a pilot refiner. The enzyme was added at four levels, including a control pulp with no enzyme. The dewatering properties of the handsheets formed from the pulp were tested and compared for each enzyme dosage. The morphology of fibres of each of the pulps was determined. It was found that increasing the enzyme dosage of the pulps resulted in the decrease of the dewatering ability of the handsheets. The number of fines in the pulp increased with increasing enzyme dosage. It was likely that fines were responsible for the restriction of pulp dewatering, as suggested by the choke-point hypothesis (Hubbe, 2007). Based on the extent of fibrillation and width of fibres, as well as the number of fines in the pulp, a model of the effect of the enzyme added on the dewatering of the pulp was proposed. Increasing the enzyme concentration in the pulp increased the susceptibility of the fibre to refining. An enzyme dosage of 100 g/t resulted in a more fibrillated fibre than found in the control pulp. However, the fibres of the pulp treated with the enzyme at a concentration of 200 g/t were less fibrillated, suggesting that the fibre surface was weakened to the extent that the fibrils were broke off during refining. The fibres of the pulp treated at 500 g/t were again more fibrillated, suggesting the occurrence of secondary fibrillation of the fibre at this high enzyme dosage. The fibres of the pulps treated at 500 and 200 g/t were also narrower, suggesting the loss of fibre material.

40|$|The {{quality of}} OSB (oriented strand boards) is mainly {{determined}} by three process steps: flaking, mat <b>forming,</b> <b>and</b> <b>pressing.</b> Strand geometry, {{influenced by the}} flaking process, strand orientation and homogeneity during mat forming, and the surface evenness are crucial properties which determine the board quality. Fraunhofer WKI in Braunschweig developed off-line and on-line evaluation methods based on image processing, thermography, and optical 3 D measurement. Strand orientation during the mat forming process can be monitored using image processing: A camera continuously acquires gray-value images of {{a part of the}} mat surface moving from the mat forming station towards the press. After a transformation of the image into the spatial frequency domain (via FFT) and the application of an algorithm suitable for segmentation of the strands in the top layer one can derive indices for the mat quality: The deviation of the orientation angles of the strands from the production direction, an index for the quality of orientation, and an index for the size distribution of the strands. The software using these methods is ready for integration into statistical process control concepts. As a matter of fact the geometry of the strands influences the quality of the OSB, and here in particular the strength properties. Another software for statistic laboratory analyses of the strand geometry was developed allowing the evaluation of size and outline parameters. Thus, for example, the post-disintegration and smoothing of the particle shapes by the drying process could be verified. Thermography transforms the temperature distribution on a surface into gray-value images (thermograms). Thermal images of boards leaving the press reflect the local density distribution of the board. Therefore, thermographic inspection of the boards after leaving the press may be a novel technique for on-line density monitoring. One surface property of OSB is the evenness (or roughness) characterized by the frequency of small gaps (typically some millimeters wide and not deeper than one millimeter) appearing in the surface near crossing strands. For laboratory purposes a measuring technique based on fringe-projection and image processing has been tested to evaluate different surface qualities. As a result, the OSB surface can be visualized as a topographic map together with statistics on amount and size of gaps. Most of the measuring techniques presented here have already been tested in the industry or under comparable conditions. They are ready for implementation to close some gaps in process measurement technology...|$|E
40|$|Most of {{the water}} fed into a paper machine is removedmechanically in the forming and press sections. One of thefactor which has an {{important}} influence on mechanicaldewatering, i. e. in both <b>forming</b> <b>and</b> <b>pressing,</b> is thestress-strain behaviour of the fibre network. The focus of this thesis is {{on the development of}} improvedmathematical descriptions of the stress-strain behaviourexhibited by fibre networks in the forming and press sections. The first part of the thesis presents a physically based modelof the forming and densification of fibre mats in twin-wireformers. The model can calculate the ecect of the applicationof a varied load through the forming section. It was developedfrom mass and momentum balances of the fibre and liquid phases,the fibre mat stress-porosity relation and an expression forthe permeability {{as a function of the}} porosity. The fibre-matstress-porosity relation used is rate-independent and presentshysteresis. Simulations have been conducted to study theeffects of roll pressure, blade pulses, wire tension andbeating. The effect of sequential blade pressure pulses afterthe forming roll on the dewatering and the concentrationgradients could be characterised. The simulations alsoexhibited rewetting by expansion when the fibre mats left theforming roll. Increasing wire tension resulted in increaseddewatering, but the rate of increase diminished rapidly withincreasing tension. The simulation results also indicated thatbeating has a large influence on dewatering. The second part of the thesis presents two models of therate-dependent stress-strain behaviour of the fibre networkthat is observed in wet pressing. The first model was based onthe approach pioneered by Perzyna (1966) for strain-ratedependent plasticity and was quite satisfactory for calculatingthe stress-strain behaviour of the fibre network in singlepress nips. It was successfully applied for studyingdensification and dewatering in both normal wet pressing andhigh temperature wet pressing. However, the first model onlyincludes rate dependence in the compression phase of thecompressionexpansion cycle; the expansion phase is treated asbeing rate independent The second model of the stress-strain behaviour of the fibrenetwork treats both compression and expansion as being ratedependent, according to experimental observations. It is basedon the idea that the wet fibre web may be conceived as alayered network of restricted swelling gels. A swollen fibre isa restricted gel, the inner swelling pressure in a swollenfibre wall being balanced by the stresses in the fibre wallstructure. The observed rate dependence of wet webs in bothcompression and expansion phases was attributed to the flow ofwater out of and into the fibre walls. The second model gavepredictions that are in good agreement with results fromuniaxial experiments using pressure pulses of arbitrary shapefor both a single pulse and a sequence of pulses. It maytherefore be used as a general model for the rheologicalbehaviour of the wet fibre network in wet pressing, providedthe model parameters are estimated from experimental data withsmall experimental error.
