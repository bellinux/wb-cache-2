25|$|Even {{before the}} first {{selective}} COX-2 inhibitor was marketed, specialists began to suspect {{that there might be}} a cardiovascular risk associated with this class of medicines. In the VIGOR study (Vioxx Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research), rofecoxib (Vioxx) was compared to naproxen. After a short time, it became evident that there was a fivefold higher risk of myocardial infarction in the rofecoxib <b>group</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> the group that received naproxen. The authors suggested that the difference was due to the cardioprotective effects of naproxen. The APPROVe (Adenomatous Poly Prevention on Vioxx) study was a multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind trial aimed to assess the effect of three-year treatment with rofecoxib on recurrence of neoplastic polyps in individuals with a history of colorectal adenomas. In 2000 and 2001, 2587 patients with a history of colorectal adenomas were recruited and followed. The trial was stopped early (2 months before expected completion) on recommendations of its data safety and monitoring board because of concerns about cardiovascular toxicity. When looking at the results of the study, it showed a statistically significant increase in cardiovascular risk when taking rofecoxib compared to placebo beginning after 18 months of treatment. Then on 30 September Merck gave out a news release announcing their voluntary worldwide withdrawal of Vioxx.|$|E

2500|$|Walker and Stickgold {{hypothesized}} that after initial memory acquisition, sleep reorganizes memory representation at a macro-brain systems level. Their experiment {{consisted of two}} groups; the night-sleep group was taught a motor sequence block tapping task at night, put to sleep and then retested 12 hours later. The day-wake group was taught the same task {{in the morning and}} tested 12 hours later with no intervening sleep. FMRI was used to measure brain activity during retest. Results indicated significantly fewer errors/sequence in the night-sleep <b>group</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> the day wake group. FMRI output for the night-sleep group indicated increased activation in the right primary motor cortex/M1/Prefrontal Gyrus (contra lateral to the hand they were block tapping with), right anterior medial prefrontal lobe, right hippocampus (long-term memory, spatial memory), right ventral striatum (olfactory tubercle, nucleus accumbens), as well as regions of the cerebellum (lobules V1, V11). In the day-wake group, fMRI showed [...] "decreased" [...] signal activation bilaterally in the parietal cortices (integrates multiple modalities), in addition to the left insular cortex (regulation of homeostasis), left temporal pole (most anterior of temporal cortex), and the left inferior fronto-polar cortex. Previous investigations have shown that signal increases indicate brain plasticity. The increased signal activity seen in M1 after sleep corresponds to increased activity in this area seen during practice; however, an individual must practice for longer periods than they would have to sleep in order to obtain the same level of M1 signal increases. Therefore, it is suggested that sleep enhances the cortical representation of motor tasks by brain system expansion, as seen by increased signal activity.|$|E

Two hundred healthy male mice of eight to ten weeks old were used in this study. The mice were divided into four equal groups of 50 mice each. Mice of group 1 were inoculated intra-peritoneal with 1. 0 mL sterile Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) pH 7, group 2 were inoculated with 1. 0 mL of 10 9 colony forming unit (cfu) of P. multocida B: 2. Mice of groups 3 and 4 were inoculated intra-peritoneal with 1. 0 mL of LPS and 1. 0 mL of OMP, respectively.
