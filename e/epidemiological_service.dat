40|$|Background: The aim of {{our study}} was to {{establish}} the incidence of sepsis, {{as well as to}} identify the causes and source of infection in patients treated at the Department of Infectious Diseases and Febrile Conditions of General Hospital Celje in the years 2000 – 2003. Patients and methods: By means of a retrospective research we reviewed medical records of 7, 260 patients who were hospitalized in our ward in the years 2000 – 2003. The retrospective study revealed that 816 (11. 2 %) out of 7, 260 patients admitted in the period 2000 – 2003 met the criteria for the diagnosis of sepsis. Our definition of patients with sepsis was based on additional and stricter criteria than those reported in the literature. Results: The source of sepsis was known in all 816 patients included in the study, the causative agent was proved in 460 (56. 4 %) of them. Of the later, only in 70 (8. 6 %) patients it was isolated from hemoculture, while in the remaining 390 (47. 8 %) patients the causative agent was isolated from other infectious cultures. In patients with known cause of infection (460 persons), gram-negative bacteria were prevailing (332 patients, 72. 2 %). Considering only blood isolates (70 patients), the prevalence of gram-negative bacterial infections is less obvious, i. e. 38 cases (54. 3 %). Conclusions: According to our relatively strict definition, at least one tenth of all admissions to our department are attributable to sepsis, while in the period 2000 – 2003, only 102 out of 816 cases of sepsis detected in our study were reported to the <b>Epidemiological</b> <b>Service,</b> which was hardly a bit more than one percent (1. 4 %). In the same period, only 15 additional patients with sepsis (altogether 117) were reported to the <b>Epidemiological</b> <b>Service</b> of R Slovenia from Celje health region (with approximately 220. 000 population, which clearly indicates that the detection, reporting and registration of patients with sepsis is insufficient. As in Slovenia we still have not reached an agreement on the definition of sepsis, there is a great discrepancy between the number of patients diagnosed with sepsis and the number of those reported to the national <b>Epidemiological</b> <b>Service.</b> Thus, the severity of rapidly increasing number of patients with sepsis, which is nowadays ever so frequently caused by multiresistant bacteria, still remains obscure to the critical public {{as well as to the}} responsible health institutions and government authorities.

40|$|Background. Ternopil {{region is}} endemic on leptospirosis. Its natural {{conditions}} (slightly alkaline or alkaline soils, air temperature, sufficient rainfall) {{contribute to the}} existence of major natural reservoir of the pathogen–mouse-like rodents. In the region, different serovariants of leptospira are exuded by rodents and farm animals. Objective. The materials of the Department of Highly Infectious Diseases of Ternopil Regional Laboratory Centre of the State Sanitation and <b>Epidemiological</b> <b>Service</b> of Ukraine, Ternopil Regional Laboratory of Veterinary Medicine, Clinic of Infectious Diseases of TSMU were studied. Leptospiras were detected by dark ground microscopy (DFM) of blood of patients, trapped rodents and examined farm animals. Results. The circulating of pathogens between different sources (rodents, animals) and annual disease incidence evidences that new leptospira serovar are carried onto endemic area mostly by farm animals; humans are infected from them through the environment sometimes in 3 - 5 years intervals; the further diffusion to the new areas of this pathogen serovars in all kinds of the examined mouse-like rodents is noticed. It is established that farm animals and rodents are competing reservoirs. To predict the future epidemiological situation of leptospirosis among the humans and to improve its diagnosis the constant monitoring of the population, infection and leptospira carriage among mouse-like rodent and farm animals and expanding of the panel of diagnostic leptospira strains including new pathogen variants in animals is necessary. Conclusions. The development of additional reservoirs in animals, with circulating of other pathogen serovars among them, such as mouse-like rodents, which were previously absent in the main natural reservoir, cause the change of etiological structure in human leptospirosis at the endemic areas.

The aim of this work was to improve the method of assessment and prediction of epidemic situation of AII by identifying the influence of climatic and demographic factors. Materials and methods. In order to determine the influence of meteorological and demographic factors on the epidemic process of acute intestinal infections the official reports of the State Sanitary and <b>Epidemiological</b> <b>Service</b> of Ukraine in Sumy region, the Department of Statistics, Sumy Regional Center for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring have been studied.

The work {{was carried out}} on the academic basis of pediatric infectious departments of Donetsk region and Donetsk regional laboratory center of State sanitary and <b>epidemiological</b> <b>service</b> of Ukraine. Comparative analysis of complications of BCG vaccinations {{in the form of}} regional lymphadenitis for 3 years is carried out. Evaluation of immune status was based on a comprehensive study of indicators of general reactive potential of the organism by studying the qualitative-quantitative characteristics of hemogram. Results. In Donetsk region for 3 years 19, 078 children were vaccinated with BCG vaccine (Denmark) and 14, 328 — with BCG vaccine (Russia), of whom 210 children developed complications: 143 (0. 74 %) children were vaccinated with BCG vaccine (Denmark) and 67 (0. 46 %) — with Russian BCG vaccine. Clinical forms of complications to some extent were determined {{by the nature of the}} BCG vaccine. When using the BCG vaccine (Denmark), infiltrative forms were 2. 2 times more common among the complications in the form of lymphadenitis of various localization, and the presence of a fistula (5. 7 %) were detected compared with children vaccinated with BCG vaccine (Russia). In addition, very rare complications were 3 times more frequent — 10 versus 3. 3 %. They are: plague is the middle third of the left shoulder; sternoclavicular combination of BCG assoc., dest. + MBT(–), newly diagnosed tuberculosis (NDT), secondary pulmonary tuberculosis; tuberculous osteitis of the right hip; tuberculous osteitis of the lower third of the right hip; tuberculous osteitis of the 4 / 3 of the right femur; tuberculous osteitis of the left knee joint with BCG vaccine (Denmark). When BCG vaccine (Russia) was used, we detected only NDT, tuberculous osteitis and NDT, onitis, D+, MBT(+). Features of general reactive potential of the organism at BCG vaccination are determined by more significant degree of inflammatory activity in young children, as well as by a decrease in the body’s ability to respond to antigenic stimulus and a pronounced risk of breaking a barrier to infection — the possibility of generalization of infection in infants on the background of normal allergic disposition of the body. Conclusions. When using BCG vaccine of Russian production, there is far less significant overload of blood flow by products of intoxication and inflammation, more pronounced body’s ability to respond to antigenic stimulus generalization and no risk of infection, especially in infants, compared with Danish BCG vaccine. For vaccination of infants against tuberculosis, it is advisable to use more refined, with high immunogenicity and less reactogenic BCG vaccine of Russian production. Despite the presence of complications when using BCG vaccine, protection of the body from the development of generalized forms of tuberculosis in young children is possible by vaccination in the neonatal period...|$|E

According to the biotype of bacterial contamination certain inter-bacterial relations are formed, which {{is reflected in}} the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of appropriate microbial landscape. Analysis of numerous microbial association manifestations allows evaluating changes in the pathogen properties influenced by associative microbiota. Work objective - based on the study ecological features of microorganisms isolated from intestine of patients with acute intestinal infections and apparently healthy people, identify potential risk factors for diarrheal infections. Materials & methods. A retrospective epidemiological analysis of acute diarrheal infections incidence was conducted during 2004 - 2013, using the statistics of the Main Department of the State Sanitary and <b>Epidemiological</b> <b>Service</b> of Ukraine in Sumy region. The intestinal microflora of 93 patients with acute diarrheal infections and 60 persons of the control group (apparently healthy people). As the result 130 bacterial cultures were allocated. Permanence rate was used to estimate biocenosis. Relationships between microbiocenosis members were investigated by determining degree of bond conjunction in associations, using Jaccard coefficient (g). Results & discussion. In 2005 - 2014 acute diarrheal infection incidence rates of Sumy region population were within 163. 7 - 193. 6 per 100 people without tendency to decrease. Acute intestinal infections and food toxicoinfections caused by opportunistic pathogens and viruses (p< 0. 05) dominated in nosological structure. In 35. 5 % of cases diarrheal infections were of polyetiological nature. Noroviruses in associations with Candida bacteriaand fungi most often occurred (p< 0. 05) in the intestinal biotypes. Permanence rate of K. pneumonia, noroviruses, S. aureus, C. albicans was the highest and was accordinly 23. 6; 21. 5; 19. 4 and 19. 4 %. C. albicans (88. 9 %), noroviruses (80 %), S. thyphimurium (80 %), P. aeruginosae (75 %), E. cloacae (75 %), S. aureus (72. 2 %), K. pneumonia (68. 2 %), rotaviruses (66. 7 %) had average and high associativity coefficient values. The most part of associated causative agents (p< 0. 05) had antagonistic relations. Stable bacterial associations were formed between noroviruses and K. pneumonia, noroviruses and S. typhimurium, noroviruses and P. aeruginosae (g respectively 36. 4; 40. 0; 40. 0 %). C. albicans, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, E. cloacae were isolated from healthy people feces in diagnostically significant degree of contamination 43. 3 % of cases.

Results and discussion. The work on the evaluation of the epidemiological situation of the AII begins from collecting data, according to the AII sick rate. The main source of this information is the logbook of infectious diseases, which recorded all sick people that were found in the area. It is necessary to gather the initial information, calculate the sick rate and monthly distribution of AII cases on investigated area and evaluate the tendency. At the same time with accounting of AII cases on investigated territory, takes place a monitoring of air temperature, humidity and rainfall. Simultaneously, should be gathered the information about the population on the investigated area, its density (for 1 km 2), natural and migratory movement. When the information is gathered, begins the stage of analytical research. At first, determines the long-term tendency of the sick rate. If the average time of growth of the sick rate ranges from 0 to 1. 0 % - the epidemiological situation of this nosology is good, ranges from 1. 1 % to 5. 0 % - unstable, more than 5. 0 % - bad. The probability of the influence of natural and social "risk factors» (X) on the AII sick rate (Y) calculates according to this formula: Rxy = Ʃ dx•dy / √Ʃ dx 2 •dy 2, where Rxy - correlation coefficient; dx - departure from the arithmetical average of levels of natural or social factors; dy - departure from the arithmetical average of the annual sick rate or seasonal distribution. If it was founded an authentic correlation (p< 0. 05) between the average monthly rates of air temperature, humidity, rainfallы, number and density of population (per 1 km 2), natural and migratory movements, and the sick rate of the AII nosological entities, the AII epidemical situation, in a case of increasing of the indicators of abovementioned "risk factors", will be also considered as unstable, which requires immediate elaboration and implementation of the targeted preventive steps. a result, the study found, that in current conditions in Sumy region the epidemical situation of shigellosis, AIIDA and AIIUE is good, according to Тred. av. = - 10. 7 % for shigellosis, and Тgr. av. = + 0. 6 % for acute intestinal infection, caused by other determined agents (AIIDA) and acute intestinal infections of unknown etiology (AIIUE); epidemical situation of salmonellosis is unstable, because: Тgr. av. = + 2. 3 %. It was found, that the number and density of population (1 km 2). Similar relationships were also found between the levels of salmonellosis sick rate and net migration rate and natural population movement. On the seasonal distribution of salmonellosis sick rate affected temperature and rainfall. From the average daily temperature levels, to some extent, depended a frequency of cases, in which people with AIIDA asked for medical service. Thus, despite the fact, that in the current conditions of Sumy region, epidemical situation of shigellosis and AIIDA is considered as good, accordingly: Т red. av. = - 10. 7 % і Тgr. av. = + 0. 6 %, increasing of number and density of population and average daily temperature in this region can cause increase the sick rates of shigellosis and acute intestinal infection, caused by other determined agents. The epidemical situation of salmonellosis at the time of research was unstable (T gr. av. = 2. 3 %), but if the indicators of the natural and migratory movement of population are increasing, the situation will be worse. Although, climatic factors haven`t got a direct relation to the transmission of salmonellosis agents, and not directly related to it, but they influence on the dynamics of this disease. Conclusion. So, in a case of growth of number and density of population, can exist the favourable conditions for increasing of shigellosis epidemical process; rising of natural and migratory movements and levels of daily average temperature and rainfall promote the probability of salmonellosis; rising of environmental temperature promotes the probability of AIIDA. To avoid the aggravation of the AII epidemical situation, when the levels of natural and social "risk factors" are growing up, it is necessary to organize and take the prophylactic measures immediately. This method can be used by Hygienic and Epidemiological Center in conducting of epidemiological surveillances of intestinal infections for optimizing of preventive measures...|$|E

40|$|Participatory {{epidemiology}} (PE) is {{the application}} of participatory rural appraisal techniques to epidemiological studies and disease surveillance. The use of PE techniques in disease surveillance is termed participatory disease surveillance (PDS), a decision-oriented approach for the collection of epidemiological intelligence. In PDS, surveillance is defined as information for action. The techniques of PDS were first developed {{as part of the}} global eradication of rinderpest. Participatory surveillance made significant contributions to the program by uncovering some of the last foci of disease. Since that time, PDS has been adopted by several official veterinary services around the world as a form of targeted surveillance in national control programs. Surveillance applications have included avian influenza, classical swine fever, peste des petits ruminants, Rift valley fever and foot and mouth disease (FMD). The flexibility, timeliness and sensitivity of PE and PDS can enhance the effectiveness of surveillance programs in both developed and developing country contexts. The capacity building process to establish PE relies on consultation between national stakeholders to conceptualize national epidemiological objectives, formulate the components of the comprehensive epidemiological program and then to build a training program to develop personnel with the key skills to put the research and surveillance plan in action. The Participatory Epidemiology Network for Animal and Public Health (PENAPH) has been established to help meet the demand for enhancement of <b>epidemiological</b> <b>services.</b> It does this through support for capacity building in PE, helping t...|$|R
