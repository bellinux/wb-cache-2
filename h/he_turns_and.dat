2500|$|Marwood {{prepares to}} leave for the station, turning down Withnail's request for one last drink. In Regent's Park in the rain, Marwood confesses that he will miss Withnail, but does not allow him to {{accompany}} him further to the station. Bottle of wine in hand, Withnail declaims [...] "What a piece of work is a man!" [...] from Hamlet to an uncomprehending pack of wolves behind a fence in the London Zoo. The camera watches as <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> walks away into the gloomy distance, swinging the bottle, as the credits start to roll.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> {{goes out}} slowly, Left Forward, {{followed}} by GRAVITER.|$|E
6000|$|... "The old gent murmurs {{something}} to himself about a stone which the builders wouldn't have at any price; and then <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> puts it straight: ...|$|E
60|$|Benjamin did not wince. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> away <b>and</b> {{looked out}} across the sea for a few moments. The last agony of his great {{renunciation}} was upon him. Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> held out his hand.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned,</b> <b>and</b> lurched {{into the}} dining-room upon legs that trembled.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> walked away. Louise {{watched him}} with very real interest.|$|R
6000|$|And {{toy with}} him in amorous jests, and when <b>he</b> <b>turns,</b> <b>and</b> snarls, and gnaws, O smite him with your jasper claws! and bruise him with your agate breasts! ...|$|E
6000|$|MURRAY (with a grin). Sure thing! You can {{consider}} yourself heartlessly jilted. (<b>He</b> <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> raises his glass {{towards the door}} through which Eileen has just gone, as if toasting her.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look again," [...] I said. [...] "He {{reaches the}} top of the mount and stands there staring towards the south. Oh! now <b>he</b> <b>turns,</b> <b>and</b> the {{moonlight}} shines upon his face." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> went out; and met Ethel on {{reaching}} West's house.|$|R
60|$|Presently <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> {{spoke to}} me in a low, {{confidential}} tone.|$|R
60|$|Hardwick {{glanced toward}} the iron box. Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> faced Hal.|$|R
6000|$|While he is {{speaking}} KATHERINE has stolen closer. She suddenly [...] drops on her knees by his side and wraps his hand in her hair. [...] <b>He</b> <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> clasps her.|$|E
6000|$|Anon {{the book}} is closed, [...] With [...] "It is finished!" [...] And at the alley's end [...] <b>He</b> <b>turns,</b> <b>and</b> soon on me his glances bend; And, as from earth, comes speech--small, muted, yet composed.|$|E
6000|$|Re-enter CONSTANT softly with a {{bunch of}} keys in his hand. On [...] his way to the cabinet <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> looks at NAPOLEON. Seeing [...] the glass and a strangeness in the EMPEROR, he {{abandons}} his [...] object, rushes out, and is heard calling.|$|E
60|$|Presently she {{saw some}} one walking over {{the open space}} towards the cabin, {{and she could not}} fail to {{recognize}} the figure with the long stride, the folded arms, and the bowed head. He passed the window <b>and</b> then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> repassed it, then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> walked by again, this time a little nearer than before.|$|R
60|$|So saying, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> {{left the}} house, {{followed}} by a tremendous cheer.|$|R
60|$|The lad {{required}} {{no second}} bidding. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> fled like a greyhound.|$|R
6000|$|... (She remains silent. His face darkens. <b>He</b> <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> strides out [...] of the door. Mary darts {{after him}} with a frightened cry of [...] "Papa." [...] Eileen covers {{her face with her}} hands and a shudder of [...] relief runs over her body.) ...|$|E
6000|$|BURGESS (assenting). No: she was younger. (Miss Garnett stolidly {{stares at}} him; then goes out with great dignity. He {{receives}} this quite obtusely, and {{crosses to the}} hearth-rug, where <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> spreads himself {{with his back to}} the fire.) Startin' on your rounds, Mr. Mill? ...|$|E
60|$|GREGORY. I am. I simply adore you. [They go out together; and as {{they pass}} through the door <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> says in a ringing voice to the other couple] I have said to Mrs. Juno that I simply adore her. [He takes her out defiantly].|$|E
60|$|When {{he reached}} the door <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> smiled {{significantly}} at his wife.|$|R
60|$|Maraton moved {{towards the}} door. Holding it open, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> faced them.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> {{indicated}} the ruddy-faced, red-haired man {{who held the}} helm.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> {{regards the}} girl sternly. Is she taking {{advantage}} of his being a lonely stranger, far from home and friends, to mock him? He goes over to {{what she calls the}} bed, and snatching off the top-most sack from the pile and holding it up, says: ...|$|E
6000|$|... [The PRINCE REGENT, {{having gone}} {{the round of}} the other rooms, now [...] appears at the ball-room door, and stands looking at the dancers. [...] Suddenly <b>he</b> <b>turns,</b> <b>and</b> gazes about with a ruffled face. He sees [...] a tall, red-faced man near him--LORD MOIRA, one of his friends.] ...|$|E
6000|$|COKESON turns blandly to the JUDGE, {{as though}} to rebuke counsel [...] for not remembering that the JUDGE might wish to have a chance; [...] {{arriving}} at the conclusion that he is to be asked nothing [...] further, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> descends from the box, and sits down next [...] to JAMES and WALTER.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> {{moved down}} the track, {{vanishing}} into the growing darkness.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> faced her. There {{was a most}} {{unpleasant}} {{light in}} his eyes.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> {{led them}} hastily towards the back door. Isabel gripped Granet's arm.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Oh, indeed, cousin,' says Will, and <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> {{winks at}} a friend of his, Captain Deuceace, whose own and whose wife's {{reputation}} I dare say you heard of when you frequented the clubs, and whom Will has introduced into this simple family {{as a man of}} the highest fashion. 'Don't be afraid, miss,' says Mr. Will, 'nor my cousin needn't be.' ...|$|E
6000|$|NAPOLEON. Hm! (He {{looks at}} her, {{takes up the}} packet and looks at it, pursing his lips and {{balancing}} it in his hand; looks at her again; passes the packet into {{his left hand and}} puts it behind his back, raising his right to scratch {{the back of his head}} as <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> goes up to the edge of the vineyard, where he stands for a moment looking out into the vines, deep in thought. The Lady watches him in silence, somewhat slightingly. Suddenly <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> comes back again, full of force and decision.) I grant your request, madame. Your courage and resolution deserve to succeed. Take the letters for which you have fought so well; and remember henceforth that you found the vile, vulgar Corsican adventurer as generous to the vanquished after the battle as he was resolute in the face of the enemy before it. (He offers her the packet.) ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{rounds the}} corner and shuffles away, casting off thus easily the ties of acquaintanceship as the moribund do, the season of {{dissolution}} being man's supreme hour of egoism and selfishness. But <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> calls back through the fog to the other: [...] "I say, Goodall of Memphis! If you get there before I do, tell 'em Hurd's a-comin' too. Hurd, of T'leder, Ah-hia." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> {{looked at}} his sister-in-law. 'Do you hear that?' he asked coldly.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> {{retreated into}} the wood, and Margery, sighing, went on her way.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> seized {{one of her}} hands, {{holding it}} {{strongly}} against her will.|$|R
