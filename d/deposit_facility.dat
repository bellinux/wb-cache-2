25|$|A fourth facility, the Term <b>Deposit</b> <b>Facility,</b> was {{announced}} December 9, 2009, and approved April 30, 2010, with an effective date of June 4, 2010. The Term <b>Deposit</b> <b>Facility</b> allows Reserve Banks to offer term deposits to {{institutions that are}} eligible to receive earnings on their balances at Reserve Banks. Term deposits are intended to facilitate the implementation of monetary policy by providing a tool by which the Federal Reserve can manage the aggregate quantity of reserve balances held by depository institutions. Funds placed in term deposits are removed from the accounts of participating institutions {{for the life of}} the term deposit and thus drain reserve balances from the banking system.|$|E

2500|$|In July 2009, Sweden's central bank, the Riksbank, set {{its policy}} repo rate, the {{interest}} rate on its one-week <b>deposit</b> <b>facility,</b> at 0.25%, {{at the same time}} as setting its overnight deposit rate at -0.25%. The existence of the negative overnight deposit rate was a technical consequence of the fact that overnight deposit rates are generally set at 0.5% below or 0.75% below the policy rate. This is not technically an example of [...] "negative interest on excess reserves," [...] because Sweden does not have a reserve requirement, but imposing a reserve interest rate without reserve requirements imposes an implied reserve requirement of zero. The Riksbank studied the impact of these changes and stated in a commentary report that they led to no disruptions in Swedish financial markets.|$|E

Our model is consistent with central banks' observed practice of rationing access to marginal facilities when the objective of stabilizing short-term interest rates conflicts with another high-frequency objective, such as the targeting of exchange rates.

40|$|Since 2014, the ECB {{has applied}} a {{negative}} interest rate on the excess reserves (and <b>deposit</b> <b>facilities)</b> of commercial banks. This policy is complementary to Quantitative Easing (QE), a program whereby the ECB purchases securities on financial markets. Indeed, the QE provides liquidity to the banks and {{negative interest rate}}s encourage them to reallocate this liquidity. The negative reserve rate amplifies the fall in short-term and long-term market rates and reinforces the incentive for commercial banks to operate reallocation on their portfolios towards riskier assets. The total amount of liquidity subject to a negative interest rate is 1047 billion euros. Negative interest rates should reduce interest rate margins but the impact on profitability is mitigated by the capital gains banks realise when selling securities to the ECB under QE, by the possibility banks have to finance themselves at negative rates, by {{a decrease in the}} risk of default and by the possibility to raise non-interest income...|$|R

40|$|While much {{attention}} has been paid to India’s economic growth, the extent of financial inclusion within the country is rarely examined. This paper assesses financial inclusion in India and provides pointers to what can be done to increase inclusion as an important component of India’s overall economic growth strategy. As India’s economy continues to grow and incomes rise, there is an increased need for financial services. There has been considerable improvement in the deepening of the financial system through growth in bank credit and the spread of <b>deposit</b> <b>facilities.</b> However, it is important to examine access to credit in both urban and rural areas and deposit services of small and medium enterprises to determine the true reach of the financial sector. The issue of financial inclusion is especially important today as India’s rural economy has shifted towards more commercialized agriculture and non-agricultural activities, both of which require banking facilities. The evidence on financial inclusion is mixed. The situation is not as poor as has been asserted in recent analyses. There appears to be relatively healthy access to secure formal facilities for savings, but access to credit in rural areas has not grown as might be expected. I...|$|R
