500|$|The {{dividing}} wall was removed by parish members on 7March 1995, while others started clearing the truss. The institute called the police, OMON, for help. The following day, more {{conflict with the}} police occurred and several parish members, among them a nun, were injured. Others were arrested, including a priest and a seminarian, but were released the next day. After these events, the Apostolic Administrator, Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz, wrote {{an open letter to}} the Russian President, Boris Yeltsin, on 9March 1995, requesting his intervention: [...] "It seems that persecution of the church was history. <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>case?</b> I can't remember seeing a priest arrested, and I can't remember seeing a nun beaten up." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2009, The Guardian {{reported}} that it was forbidden to report on a parliamentary matter – a question recorded in a Commons order paper, to be answered by a minister later that week. The paper noted that it was being [...] "forbidden from telling its readers why the paper is prevented—for {{the first time in}} memory—from reporting parliament. Legal obstacles, which cannot be identified, involve proceedings, which cannot be mentioned, on behalf of a client who must remain secret. The only fact the Guardian can report <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> involves the London solicitors Carter-Ruck." [...] The paper further claimed that this case appears [...] "to call into question privileges guaranteeing free speech established under the 1688 Bill of Rights". The only parliamentary question mentioning Carter-Ruck in the relevant period was by Paul Farrelly MP, in reference to legal action by Barclays and Trafigura. The part of the question referencing Carter-Ruck relates to the latter company's September 2009 gagging order on the publication of a 2006 internal report into the 2006 Côte d'Ivoire toxic waste dump scandal, which involved a class action case that the company only settled in September 2009 after The Guardian published some of the commodity trader's internal emails. The reporting injunction was lifted the next day, as Carter-Ruck withdrew it before The Guardian could challenge it in the High Court. Alan Rusbridger credited the rapid back-down of Carter-Ruck to Twitter, as did a BBC article.|$|E

60|$|The {{suggestion}} of this joint commission has been criticised as an unwarrantable intrusion into {{the internal affairs}} of another country. But then the whole question from the beginning was about {{the internal affairs of}} another country, since the internal equality of the white inhabitants was the condition upon which self-government was restored to the Transvaal. It is futile to suggest analogies, and to imagine what France would do if Germany were to interfere in a question of French franchise. Supposing that France contained as many Germans as Frenchmen, and that they were ill-treated, Germany would interfere quickly enough and continue to do so until some fair modus vivendi was established. The fact <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of the Transvaal stands alone, that such a condition of things has never been known, and that no previous precedent can apply to it, save the general rule that a minority of white men cannot continue indefinitely to tax and govern a majority. Sentiment inclines to the smaller nation, but reason and justice are all on the side of England.|$|E
60|$|It {{does happen}} {{that there are}} very {{singular}} circumstances in this business, to which your Lordships will advert; and you will consider what weight {{they ought to have}} upon your Lordships' minds. The person who is now the solicitor of the Company is a very respectable man in the profession,--Mr. Smith; he was at that time also the Company's solicitor, and he has since appeared in this cause as Mr. Hastings's solicitor. Now there is something particular in a man's being the solicitor to a party who was prosecuting another, and continuing afterwards in his office, and becoming the solicitor to the party prosecuted. It would be nearly as strange as if our solicitor were to be the solicitor of Mr. Hastings in this prosecution and trial before your Lordships. It is true, that we cannot make out, nor do we attempt to prove, that Mr. Smith was at that time actually Mr. Hastings's solicitor: all that we shall attempt to make out <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> he produced was just such a case as a solicitor anxious for the preservation of his client, and not anxious for the prosecution, would have made out.|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This work concerns the construction of Calabi-Yau threefolds in codimension 4. Based on a study of Hilbert series, we give a list of families of Calabi-Yau threefolds which may exist in codimension 3 and codimension 4. Using birational methods, we construct Calabi-Yau threefolds that realize several of the listed families. <b>The</b> main result <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> we consider in codimension 4 lie in two different deformation components...|$|R
60|$|This analogy, which I {{pointed out}} in a Memoir on Generic Images, [11] has been {{extended}} and confirmed by subsequent experience of the process. One objection to my view was that our so-called generalisations are commonly no more than representative cases, our recollections being apt to be unduly influenced by particular events, and not by the totality {{of what we have}} seen; that the reason why some one recollection has prevailed <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> was sharply defined, or had something unusual about it, or that our frame of mind was at the time of observation susceptible to that particular kind of impression. I have had exactly the same difficulties with the composites. If one of the individual portraits has sharp outlines, or if it is unlike the rest, or if the illumination is temporarily strong, it will assert itself unduly in the result. The cases seem to me exactly analogous. I get over my photographic difficulty very easily by throwing the sharp portrait a little out of focus, by eliminating such portraits as have exceptional features, and by toning down the illumination to a standard intensity.|$|E
60|$|Now, my Lords, {{in making}} this charge I am in a very awkward and {{unpleasant}} situation; {{but it is a}} situation in which, with all the disagreeable circumstances attending it, I must proceed. I am, in this business, obliged to name many men: I do not name them wantonly, but from the absolute necessity, as your Lordships will see, of the case. I do not mean to reflect upon this gentleman: I believe, at the time when he made this case, and especially the article which I state as a falsification, he must have trusted to some of the servants of the Company, who were but young in their service at that time. There was a very great error committed; but by whom, or how, your Lordships {{in the course of this}} inquiry will find. What I charge first <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> was improperly stated; secondly, that it was partially stated; and that afterwards a further report was made upon reference to the same officer in the committee. Now, my Lords, of the three charges which I have made, the two former, namely, the misrepresentation and suppression, were applicable to the case; but all the three, misrepresentation, suppression, and falsification, were applicable to the report.|$|E
6000|$|But this {{involved}} {{accuracy of}} the thing makes {{it very difficult to}} do what I now have to do, to describe this accumulation of truth. It is very hard for a man to defend anything of which he is entirely convinced. It is comparatively easy when he is only partially convinced. He is partially convinced because he has found this or that proof of the thing, and he can expound it. But a man is not really convinced of a philosophic theory when he finds that something proves it. He is only really convinced when he finds that everything proves it. And the more converging reasons he finds pointing to this conviction, the more bewildered he is if asked suddenly to sum them up. Thus, if one asked an ordinary intelligent man, {{on the spur of the}} moment, [...] "Why do you prefer civilization to savagery?" [...] he would look wildly round at object after object, and would only be able to answer vaguely, [...] "Why, there is that bookcase [...] . and the coals in the coal-scuttle [...] . and pianos [...] . and policemen." [...] The whole case for civilization <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for it is complex. It has done so many things. But that very multiplicity of proof which ought to make reply overwhelming makes reply impossible.|$|E

500|$|The {{reaction}} {{of the public and}} <b>the</b> press <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> had <b>been</b> thrown out because of direct pressure from <b>the</b> government, and <b>that</b> this had happened behind closed doors. MacDonald was [...] "furious", and the opinion of the Liberal and Conservative parties <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> government <b>was</b> attempting to pervert the course of justice. On 30 September Sir Kingsley Wood, a Conservative MP, asked the Prime Minister in Parliament whether he had instructed the Director of Public Prosecutions to withdraw <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> MacDonald replied <b>that</b> [...] "I <b>was</b> not consulted regarding either the institution or the subsequent withdrawal of these proceedings".|$|R

25|$|Overall, {{the data}} implicating {{specific}} {{genes in the}} development of drug addiction is mixed for most genes.

Many addiction studies focus on common variants with an allele frequency of greater than 5% in the general population, however when associated with disease, these only confer a small amount of additional risk with an odds ratio of 1.1–1.3 percent. On the other hand, the rare variant hypothesis states that genes with low frequencies in the population (<1%) confer much greater additional risk {{in the development of}} disease.|$|R
5000|$|Assistant Clerk of Court, lawyer Manuel Cervantes, said no {{irregularity}} {{had been}} committed when the 8th division {{came out with the}} decision instead of the 9th, simply a result of the reorganization of the court. [...] "The case goes with the ponente(justice assigned to pen the case),” Cervantes explained. “Justice Vicente Roxas is the ponente. Even with the change in division, the case stays with him." [...] “Due to the retirement of some justices, Justice Vidal was reassigned to the 6th Division while Reyes became chair of the 8th,” Cervantes said. Roxas was moved to the 8th division, Vidal went to the 6th, and Sabio to the 9th. And since the rule <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> goes with the ponente,the 57-page decision was issued by the division of which Justice Roxas was now a part, he said. Permission is not required from the previous division nor its justices.|$|E
50|$|All these aspects, {{together}} with the numerous cases of sentences based on false accusations, have led some, including relatives of the alleged robbers, to doubt that any robbery actually took place or that those charged with the crime really committed it, especially as there was no actual direct identification of the accused by the supposed witnesses. One conjecture <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> was manufactured {{by the government in}} an attempt to justify a purge in the Securitate ranks - by accusing officers of incompetence in solving the case - as well as to remove most remaining Jews from leading positions inside the government and Communist Party. Yet another contention with no evidence is that the executions were staged, so that the five men would have their records erased and become undercover agents abroad. Since most evidence has been filtered by the Securitate, the truth is extremely hard to discern, especially since Securitate files are unlikely to contain any self-incriminating notes of the staging of the heist, and restrict themselves to following the official story-line.|$|E
5000|$|California's expungement law permits someone {{convicted of}} a crime to file a Petition for Dismissal with the court to re-open the case, set aside the plea, and dismiss the case. In order for one to qualify for expungement, the {{petitioner}} must have completed probation, paid all fines and restitution, and not currently be charged with a crime. If the requirements are met for eligibility, a court may grant the petition if it finds that {{it would be in the}} interest of justice to do so. A successful expungement will not erase the criminal record, but rather the finding of guilt will be changed to a dismissal. The petitioner then can honestly and legally answer to a question about their criminal history, with some exceptions, that they have not been convicted of that crime. [...] What is actually stated on the record of the case <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> was dismissed after conviction.
