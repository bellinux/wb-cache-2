5|$|The {{profound}} economic {{impacts on}} local <b>fishermen,</b> <b>who</b> couldn’t fish during the fishery closures, {{led to the}} filing of several lawsuits. These suits, along with those by homeowners who are alleging losses in property value, were consolidated into a class-action lawsuit against Plains. An additional class-action suit was filed by stockholders claiming Plains provided “false and misleading statements” regarding pipeline maintenance and monitoring.|$|E
5|$|The villages {{documented}} {{changes in}} their towns {{as a result of}} the opening of the sluice gates. <b>Fishermen</b> <b>who</b> had been forced to leave for the city returned to their homes, the increase in fish caused a boom in the rural economy, in fishing and tourism.

5|$|Despite {{the safer}} eastern channel and {{improvements}} in maritime technology, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution still deals with incidents at the Doom Bar. In February 1997, two <b>fishermen</b> <b>who</b> were not wearing lifejackets drowned after their boat capsized. Two anglers {{had been killed in}} a similar incident in 1994. On 25 June 2007, the Padstow lifeboat and a rescue helicopter rescued the crews of two yachts in separate incidents from the area.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, American prospectors began to spread into the area. Making deals with the Native Tlingit and Tagish tribes, the early prospectors opened the {{important}} routes of Chilkoot and White Pass, and reached the Yukon valley between 1870 and 1890. Here, they encountered the Hän people, semi-nomadic hunters and <b>fishermen</b> <b>who</b> lived along the Yukon and Klondike Rivers. The Hän did not appear to know about the extent of the gold deposits in the region.|$|E
5|$|Both the British and Spanish {{settlements}} coexisted in {{the archipelago}} until 1774, when Britain's new economic and strategic considerations led it to voluntarily {{withdraw from the}} islands, leaving a plaque claiming the Falklands for King George III. Spain's Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata became the only governmental presence in the territory. West Falkland was left abandoned, and Puerto Soledad became mostly a prison camp. Amid the British invasions of the Río de la Plata during the Napoleonic Wars in Europe, the islands' governor evacuated the archipelago in 1806; Spain's remaining colonial garrison followed suit in 1811, except for gauchos and <b>fishermen</b> <b>who</b> remained voluntarily.|$|E

5|$|Caldas da Rainha's {{coat of arms}} {{was granted}} by Queen Leonor, before {{municipal}} coats of arms were typically used in Portugal. The centre of the city's arms consist of the queen's personal arms, flanked on the right by a shrimping net, to commemorate the <b>fishermen</b> <b>who</b> rescued her drowning son Prince Afonso, and on the left a pelican feeding its young, a symbol of her husband, King João II. Because of its early introduction, several elements of the arms violate Portuguese heraldic standards. The municipal flag consists of the coat of arms on a purple and yellow gyronny.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th {{century the}} town was at the centre of Puritan {{emigration}} to America, and the local rector, John White, organised the settlement of Dorchester, Massachusetts. The first colonisation attempted was at Cape Ann, where <b>fishermen</b> <b>who</b> would rejoin the fishing fleet when the vessels returned the next year, tried to be self-sufficient. However, the land was unsuitable, the colony failed and was moved {{to what is now}} Salem. In 1628 the enterprise received a Royal Charter and the Massachusetts Bay Company was formed with three hundred colonists arriving in America that year and more the following year.|$|E
5|$|Sea snakes are {{generally}} reluctant to bite, {{and are usually}} considered to be mild-tempered, although variation is seen among species and individuals. Some species, such as P. platurus, which feed by simply gulping down their prey, {{are more likely to}} bite when provoked because they seem to use their venom more for defense. Others, such as Laticauda, use their venom for prey immobilization; these snakes are often handled without concern by local <b>fishermen,</b> <b>who</b> unravel and toss them back into the water barehanded when the snakes become entangled in fishing nets. Species reported as much more aggressive include Aipysurus laevis, Astrotia stokesii, Enhydrina schistosa, Enhydrina zweifeli, and Hydrophis ornatus.|$|E

5|$|The {{organs of}} farm animals came from slaughterhouses, while {{fishermen}} supplied those of pinnipeds {{and the smaller}} whales. The penises of larger whales came from commercial whaling stations, although this source dried up after the International Whaling Commission implemented a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Sigurður was {{able to continue to}} collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12–16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each year. He also obtained the penis of a polar bear shot by <b>fishermen</b> <b>who</b> found the animal drifting on drift ice off the Westfjords.|$|E
5|$|Alyeska {{and the oil}} {{companies}} fought objections to the pipeline's construction in both the courts and in Congress, where debates about the pipeline's environmental impact statement continued through 1971. Objections about the caribou herds were countered by observations of Davidson Ditch, a water pipeline with the same diameter of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which caribou were able to jump over. To those who argued that the pipeline would irrevocably alter Alaska wilderness, proponents pointed to the overgrown remnants of the Fairbanks Gold Rush, most {{of which had been}} erased 70years later. Some pipeline opponents were satisfied by Alyeska's preliminary design, which incorporated underground and raised crossings for caribou and other big game, gravel and styrofoam insulation to prevent permafrost melting, automatic leak detection and shutoff, and other techniques. Other opponents, including <b>fishermen</b> <b>who</b> feared tanker leaks south of Valdez, maintained their disagreement with the plan.|$|E
5|$|When the Japanese {{surrendered}} in 1945, Japanese business {{enterprises and}} organisations in Palau closed, effectively ending the Japanese influence on Palau's economy. In {{the first two}} decades after the war, the American occupation government imposed strict trade restrictions with Japan. Contact with Japan was reestablished in the 1960s, starting with Okinawan <b>fishermen</b> <b>who</b> were granted fishing rights. Japanese tourists began to visit Palau in increasing numbers from the mid-1970s. The growing influx of tourists to Palau led to the restoration of heritage sites around Palau, particularly memorial sites and administrative buildings built in the Japanese era as well as Palauan longhouses to accommodate {{to the interests of}} Japanese tourists, which accounted for half of all visiting tourists. Many of Palau's tourist sites were run and maintained by Palauan citizens of Japanese-Palauan heritage, whose knowledge in Japanese and Palauan customs and languages helped to facilitate tour groups consisting of Japanese tourists.|$|E

5|$|Arbroath {{today is}} mostly {{known for its}} {{connection}} with the Scottish fishing industry. After the original harbours, dating from the 14th and 18th centuries, were replaced in 1839 with a larger harbour, the local council tried to find <b>fishermen</b> <b>who</b> {{would be interested in}} migrating to Arbroath in order {{to take advantage of the}} new facilities offered. The town council contacted fishermen in nearby Auchmithie and further afield, including Shetland. The fishing industry grew and at its peak years between 1900 and 1980, around 40 whitefish and pelagic vessels worked from Arbroath, with hundreds of men employed directly as fishermen, hundreds more employed ashore to service the fishing vessels and to process the fish. Quota cuts and decommissioning took its toll on the fishing industry throughout Scotland from the 1980s to present. Today, Arbroath remains a designated whitefish landing port, and although no fish auction takes place, the fishmarket remains open and is used for landing shellfish. There is now only one large fishing vessel operating regularly from Arbroath, and a further three Arbroath owned vessels operating from Aberdeen and ports further north. The fish processing sector remains one of the largest employers in the town however, but fish for processing now comes from Aberdeen, Peterhead and occasionally from Iceland, Norway and Ireland.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1836, a group of five {{fishermen}} caught their nets on timbers protruding {{from the bottom of}} the Solent. They contacted a diver to help them remove the hindrance, and on , Henry Abbinett became the first person to see the Mary Rose in almost 300 years. Later, two other professional divers, John Deane and William Edwards, were employed. Using a recently invented rubber suit and metal diving helmet, Deane and Edwards began to examine the wreck and salvage items from it. Along with an assortment of timbers and wooden objects, including several longbows, they brought up several bronze and iron guns, which were sold to the Board of Ordnance for over £220. Initially, this caused a dispute between Deane (who had also brought in his brother Charles into the project), Abbinett and the <b>fishermen</b> <b>who</b> had hired them. The matter was eventually settled by allowing the fishermen a share of the proceeds from the sale of the first salvaged guns, while Deane received exclusive salvage rights at the expense of Abbinett. The wreck was soon identified as the Mary Rose from the inscriptions of one of the bronze guns manufactured in 1537.|$|E
5|$|Several causes {{provoked}} a dramatic population decrease over time: on one hand, commercial hunting (especially during the Roman Empire and Middle Ages) and, during the 20th century, eradication by <b>fishermen,</b> <b>who</b> used {{to consider it}} a pest due to the damage the seal causes to fishing nets when it preys on fish caught in them; and, on the other hand, coastal urbanization and pollution. Currently, its entire population {{is estimated to be}} less than 600 individuals scattered throughout a wide distribution range, which qualifies this species as endangered. Its current very sparse population is one more serious threat to the species, as it only has two key sites that can be deemed viable. One is the Aegean Sea (250–300 animals in Greece, with the largest concentration of animals in Gyaros island, and some 100 in Turkey); the other important subpopulation is the Western Saharan portion of Cabo Blanco (around 200 individuals which may support the small, but growing, nucleus in the Desertas Islands – approximately 20 individuals). There may be some individuals using coastal areas among other parts of Western Sahara, such as in Cintra Bay. These two key sites are virtually in the extreme opposites of the species' distribution range, which makes natural population interchange between them impossible. All the other remaining subpopulations are composed of less than 50 mature individuals, many of them being only loose groups of extremely reduced size – often less than five individuals. Consequently, there is low genetic variability.|$|E
