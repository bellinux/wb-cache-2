5|$|Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) overhears Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) confessing to {{the camera}} that he is {{having an affair with}} Angela's (Angela Kinsey) husband Robert Lipton (Jack Coleman). Oscar makes Kevin promise not to reveal anything. During the day, Angela {{constantly}} makes unconscious double entendres and foreshadowing, sorely tempting Kevin to let out what he knows. Afraid that Kevin cannot keep his secret, Oscar tries to frame Kevin so that Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) will have him fired, but confesses to Toby that he lied. Later, Robert visits the office, and Oscar acts unnaturally nervous around him. Before Angela's suspicions can be aroused, Kevin interrupts to cheer Robert on about his upcoming election. Oscar says {{to the camera}} that he is proud of how Kevin kept the secret, but Kevin then reveals that he momentarily <b>forgot</b> <b>all</b> about the secret, and begins to laugh uncontrollably.|$|E
5|$|Thus, on {{the morning}} of 13 September, the tenth day of the march from Caputvada, the Roman army {{approached}} Ad Decimum. There Gelimer planned to ambush and encircle them, using a force under his brother Ammatas to block their advance and engage them, while 2,000 men under his nephew Gibamund would attack their left flank, and Gelimer himself with the main army would attack from the rear and completely annihilate the Roman army. In the event, the three forces failed to synchronize exactly: Ammatas arrived early and was killed as he attempted a reconnaissance with a small force by the Roman vanguard, while Gibamund's force was intercepted by the Hunnic flank guard and was utterly destroyed. Unaware of all this, Gelimer marched up with the main army and scattered the Roman advance forces present at Ad Decimum. Victory might have been his, but he then came upon his dead brother's body, and apparently <b>forgot</b> <b>all</b> about the battle. This gave Belisarius the time to rally his troops, come up with his main cavalry force and defeat the disorganized Vandals. Gelimer with the remainder of his forces fled westwards to Numidia. The Battle of Ad Decimum ended in a crushing Roman victory, and Carthage lay open and undefended before Belisarius.|$|E
25|$|Oz was {{not always}} a fairyland, I am told. Once it was much like other lands, except it was shut in by a dreadful desert of sandy wastes that lay all around it, thus {{preventing}} its people from all contact {{with the rest of}} the world. Seeing this isolation, the fairy band of Queen Lurline, passing over Oz while on a journey, enchanted the country and so made it a Fairyland. And Queen Lurline left one of her fairies to rule this enchanted Land of Oz, and then passed on and <b>forgot</b> <b>all</b> about it.|$|E

500|$|Feeling guilty, Jerry ends {{up going}} to the funeral, where he, again, apologizes for his remark. Isaac informs him that Manya had {{forgotten}} Jerry made the pony remark: [...] "Oh, no no no. She <b>forgot</b> <b>all</b> about that. She was much more upset about the potato salad." [...] Elaine asks Isaac multiple times {{about what is going}} to happen with their apartment. Isaac eventually tells her that Jerry's cousin Jeffrey is going to live in it. When it starts to rain, Jerry realizes that the game will be postponed. The following day, after the game, Jerry, George and Elaine meet at Monk's Café, where they discuss the lousy way Jerry played softball. (Jerry recalls a certain play, about which he admits, [...] "It was the single worst moment of my life.") Elaine wonders if Manya's spirit put a spell on him.|$|E
500|$|An {{alternative}} studio {{version of}} [...] "What Is Life" [...] – in fact, a rough {{mix of the}} original backing track with different orchestration (in this case, piccolo trumpet and oboe) – was issued as one of five bonus tracks on the 2001 remaster of All Things Must Pass. In the accompanying booklet, Harrison writes that this orchestral arrangement was discarded because he [...] "didn't like the feel". Speaking to Billboard editor-in-chief Timothy White in December 2000, Harrison explained {{the reason for the}} lack of a guide vocal on this version: [...] "I'm playing the fuzz guitar part that goes all through the song. So all I could do on the [...] take was to give the band the cue line – the first line of each verse – and then go back to playing that riff. So that rough mix without the vocal – I'd <b>forgot</b> <b>all</b> about it …" [...] The track also appears on the 2014 Apple Years 1968–75 reissue of All Things Must Pass.|$|E

500|$|Beatrice {{was born}} at Buckingham Palace. She was the fifth {{daughter}} and youngest of the nine children of the reigning British monarch, Queen Victoria, and her husband, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (later The Prince Consort). The birth caused controversy {{when it was announced}} that Queen Victoria would seek relief from the pains of delivery through the use of chloroform administered by Dr John Snow. Chloroform was considered dangerous to mother and child and was frowned upon by the Church of England and the medical authorities. Queen Victoria was undeterred and used [...] "that blessed chloroform" [...] for her last pregnancy. A fortnight later, Queen Victoria reported in her journal, [...] "I was amply rewarded and <b>forgot</b> <b>all</b> I had gone through when I heard dearest Albert say 'It's a fine child, and a girl!'" [...] Albert and Queen Victoria chose the names Beatrice Mary Victoria Feodore: Mary after Princess Mary, Duchess of Gloucester, the last surviving child of King George III of the United Kingdom; Victoria after the Queen; and Feodore after Feodora, Princess of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, the Queen's older half-sister. She was baptised in the private chapel at Buckingham Palace on 16 June 1857. Her godparents were the Duchess of Kent (maternal grandmother); the Princess Royal (eldest sister); and the Prince Frederick of Prussia (her future brother-in-law).|$|E
500|$|When Jefferson took office, {{he moved}} {{as quickly as}} {{possible}} to fill his cabinet positions. Although he had asked James Madison to be his Secretary of State, Madison did not arrive in Washington until May 1, 1801, due to illness. In the interim, Jefferson asked Lincoln to act temporarily as Secretary of State, which he did from March 5, 1801, until Madison assumed his duties on May 2. During this time, Lincoln was involved in actions that led to the celebrated Marbury v. Madison case concerning judicial review. In the later days of the John Adams administration, the President issued a large number of commissions, some of which had not been delivered by John Marshall, his Secretary of State, at the time Jefferson assumed office. Jefferson ordered Lincoln (in his capacity as acting Secretary of State), and then Madison (after his assumption of the position) not to deliver these commissions. Some intended recipients of these commissions, William Marbury among them, filed a suit in the United States Supreme Court to compel their delivery. In his role as Attorney General, Lincoln was present at the preliminary hearing on the case, representing Madison. When the case was heard (ironically by a court headed by John Marshall, the preparer of the commissions), Lincoln was called to the stand by Marbury's attorney, former Attorney General Charles Lee. Rather than answer Lee's questions, Lincoln invoked both executive privilege and the Fifth Amendment, requesting the opportunity to consider whether or not to answer the questions. The justices granted him time, but {{made it clear that he}} must either answer the questions or clearly justify his objections to specific written questions. When Lincoln returned the next day, he answered all of the posed questions but one. Asked [...] "hat had been done with the commissions", Lincoln refused to answer directly, only stating that he did not know if Madison ever received them. The opposition press criticized Lincoln for this performance, writing that he [...] "was asked a simple question, but could not answer it until they gave it to him in writing, [...] and then he made out to remember that he had <b>forgot</b> <b>all</b> about it".|$|E
2500|$|... {{the very}} {{leaders of the}} avant garde started to signal a retreat from the core {{principles}} of Free Jazz. Anthony Braxton began recording standards over familiar chord changes. Cecil Taylor played duets in concert with Mary Lou Williams, and let her set out structured harmonies and familiar jazz vocabulary under his blistering keyboard attack. And {{the next generation of}} progressive players would be even more accommodating, moving inside and outside the changes without thinking twice. Musicians such as David Murray or Don Pullen may have felt the call of free-form jazz, but they never <b>forgot</b> <b>all</b> the other ways one could play African-American music for fun and profit.|$|E

2500|$|The Taz, a major {{commentator}} on the Rema, {{finds the}} source for the Rema's statement in the Talmudic tractate of Niddah (30b).

However, {{as soon as he}} enters the air of this world, an angel comes and strikes him on his mouth, causing him to forget the entire Torah" [...] (Taz, Yoreh Deah 265:13). Because the baby <b>forgot</b> <b>all</b> the Torah he learned, he is likened to a mourner. Just as people visit a mourner in his home to comfort him during the mourning period, people visit the home of the newborn to console him for the Torah he has forgotten.|$|E

[...] Gilbert Mant, writing in the Sydney Sun Herald said [...] "'Roaring Reggie' roared up to the stationmaster, {{the chief of police}} and other high-ranking Japanese officials at Onada and demanded a train with eight carriages."The Japanese wilted under the verbal barrage from the Australian officer but the stationmaster was adamant that no train would be permitted to leave unless Major Newton had signed a proper voucher for it.

Even his [...] "patron," [...] the Chief of the Imperial General Staff Lord Alanbrooke, {{frequently}} mentions it in his war diaries: [...] "he is liable to commit untold errors in lack of tact" [...] and [...] "I had to haul him over the coals for his usual lack of tact and egotistical outlook which prevented him from appreciating other people's feelings". One incident that illustrated this occurred during the North African campaign when Montgomery bet Walter Bedell Smith that he could capture Sfax {{by the middle of}} April 1943. Smith jokingly replied that if Montgomery could do it he would give him a Flying Fortress complete with crew. Smith promptly <b>forgot</b> <b>all</b> about it, but Montgomery did not, and when Sfax was taken on 10 April he sent a message to Smith [...] "claiming his winnings". Smith tried to laugh it off, but Montgomery was having none of it and insisted on his aircraft. It got as high as Eisenhower who, with his renowned skill in diplomacy, ensured Montgomery did get his Flying Fortress, though at a great cost in ill feeling. Even Alanbrooke thought it [...] "crass stupidity".|$|E
2500|$|... A {{few weeks}} later, our dog {{got hit by}} a {{snowplow}} and I <b>forgot</b> <b>all</b> about the problem of names. Until college, when I learned to play the guitar, and, as an exercise, started writing songs (very poorly executed) {{in the same way that}} Henry Ford produced the automobile: assembly-line-style. I wrote songs for the days of the week (poor Monday!). Songs for the planets (poor Pluto!). Songs for the Apostles (poor Judas!). And, finally, when all else failed, I started a series of songs for names. [...] Each piece was a rhetorical, philosophical, musical rumination on all the possible names I had entertained years before when my parents had given me the one chance to change my own. Oh fates! I sang these songs in the privacy of my dorm room, behind closed doors, pillows and cushions stuffed in the air vents so no one would hear. And then I almost failed Latin class, my grades plummeted, my social life dissolved into ping pong tournaments in the residence halls, and, gradually, my interest in music (or anything divine, creative, fruitful, enriching) completely waned. I turned to beer. And cigarettes. And TV sitcoms. And candy bars. Oh well! A perfectly good youth wasted on junk food! That is, until a few months ago, when I came across some of the old name songs, stuffed onto tape cassettes, 4-track recorders, forgotten boxes, forgotten shelves, forgotten hard drives. It was like finding an old diary, or a high school yearbook, senior picture with lens flare and pockmarks, slightly cute and embarrassing. What was I thinking? [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|Promptly upon {{taking the}} village, Captain Mills sent two bareback riders to tell General Crook {{that he had}} a village and was trying to hold and needed assistance. When Crook {{received}} word from Mills’s three messengers he could scarcely contain his anger at Mills. Crook was primarily interested in feeding his men and ordered Mills to avoid a fight should he encounter a large village, and instead, [...] "cut around it" [...] and go into the Black Hills to get supplies. [...] Crook also told Mills that he expected to bivouac his exhasted men and therefore Mills could not expect any immediate support. [...] Crook’s Officers debated the propriety of Mills’s attack on a hostile village of uncertain size, a controversy intensified by Custer’s defeat under like circumstances. The question was especially provocative since Mills had opened the engagement with a small supply of ammunition. Strahorn reported, [...] "Crook was very much disappointed because Mills didn’t report his discovery last night, and there was plenty of time to have got the entire command there and so effectively surrounded the village that nothing would have escaped. [...] But the General is also pleased, all things considered." [...] Staff officers in telling the receipt of this news said Crook pushed the cavalry on with all possible haste, the infantry to follow more leisurely. [...] But the tidings reaching Crook so electrified the immortal infantry that they <b>forgot</b> <b>all</b> about hunger, cold, wet and fatigue. [...] Fortunately for Mills, Crook’s column was not far behind. Crook assembled a relief contingent of about 250 men and 17 officers, plus surgeons Bennett A. Clements and Valentine T. Mcgillycuddy. [...] John Frederick Finerty, war correspondent for the Chicago Times, joined the advance column. Despite the hardships of the Horsemeat March, the troopers were excited by the prospects of a battle.|$|E

Another Midrash read [...] together with [...] "For they are life to those who find them," [...] to teach that the commandments are life to those who carry out the commandments completely, for Deuteronomy repeatedly says, [...] "all the commandment" [...] ( [...] , kol ha-mitzvah), which the Midrash taught means until one completely carries out all the precepts.
