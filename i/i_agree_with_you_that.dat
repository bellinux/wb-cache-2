In the statement, he also noted, [...] "Unfortunately, the creators of the strip made an error in judgment by referencing the Kaddish. <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that,</b> however well-meaning, the use of the Kaddish in the comic strip was inappropriate." [...] Abraham H. Foxman, ADL National Director, responded via a press release in which they thanked Scannell for his speedy response and commended the company in general for understanding the issue at hand; Foxman concluded by saying, [...] "We appreciate Nickelodeon’s long record of creative and quality programming and understand that it was not their intention to offend." ...|$|E

60|$|BURGE. On the {{contrary}} {{it will be}} fought on nothing else. I believe a program is a mistake. <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> principle is what we want.|$|E
60|$|BURGE [adroitly, as he thinks] <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> absolutely. <b>I</b> dont {{believe in}} {{coalition}} governments.|$|R

6000|$|... "There is opium in them," [...] he admitted. [...] "Believe me, {{they are}} very wonderful, but <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> they are not for the {{ordinary}} person." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have never}} {{questioned}} your wisdom in breaking it off," [...] Deane said quietly. [...] "Under the circumstances, <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> it {{is a very}} good thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{what is to}} be done? for <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that,</b> if possible, John Dormay must {{escape from}} the {{punishment}} he deserves. But how is it to be done?" ...|$|E
60|$|ARJILLAX. For once, Ecrasia, <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> A {{world in}} which there were nothing plastic would be an utterly miserable one.|$|R
6000|$|... "They don't look hospitable, certainly, Percy. <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> We {{had better}} {{keep in the}} open country, as long as possible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{just what}} I have been thinking," [...] Vincent said, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> the earlier we get through Camden the better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> {{it would}} be best to say nothing about it, till we hear that the facts are known. What has been done once, may be done again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{there should}} be others, how can we hope to find them, George?" [...] asked the lady. [...] "And yet <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> we cannot go back until we have tried." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Clear {{your mind}} of jealousy," [...] he said, [...] "and you will {{understand}} me well enough. <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I am bound to provide for my widow--and I mean {{to do it by}} insuring my life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There you hit it,' {{returned}} Bounderby. 'There <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> You {{have found}} it out at last, have you? Education!

6000|$|... "Don't borrow trouble, Snap," [...] {{answered}} the doctor's son. [...] "Yet <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> {{we must be}} more careful in the future. Is your camera all right?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{glass of}} sugar-and-water. You know, I am not easily tired. And, <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> {{it is better}} to come to {{business}} at once: so prepare them." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{trust to}} hear from Mr. Ascough of your more {{reasonable}} frame of mind, and while personally <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> we are better apart, you can always rely upon me if I can be of any service to you.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite so, Mr. Renshaw. My idea {{is there}} is nothing like being prepared, and though <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> there is little chance of trouble in this remote settlement, it is just as well to take {{precautions}} against the worst." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> Were {{she once}} placed in safe and kind hands, the less then said the better. She {{has left the}} life she was leading--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I feel convinced," [...] he said, [...] "that <b>you</b> are right. <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> <b>I</b> {{believe that}} Inspector Jacks has had that idea for some little time now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At any rate," [...] Harold said, [...] "the plan is {{a hopeful}} one, and <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> it is a {{thousand}} times better to try it {{than it is to}} stop here with the certainty of being shot down before morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{that case}} {{you would be}} shot instead of me. If Carthew is on shore, as I feel sure he is, the others won't know you from me. <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I cannot afford to risk my life just now, and yet we must search that brigantine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “It is {{the fortune}} of war, sir,” {{one of them}} said, “and {{certainly}} {{we could not have}} anticipated that you would be so wonderfully placed for defence. <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> our case was hopeless from the first, and I compliment you upon your dispositions, which were certainly admirable.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Well, {{that is all}} right, Kitty; <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> this is not {{the best}} place in the world for her, and I think it likely that I may take her away altogether.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{such things}} are not done in a day, Dick," [...] said his father, with a faint smile. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> the quicker we get after the {{treasure}} the better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{thinks it}} is, said Mr. Chaffanbrass, {{addressing}} the jury. 'Well, for once <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> <b>I</b> {{think it is}} also--and how will you have the goodness to explain it. To whom was it addressed?' ...|$|R
