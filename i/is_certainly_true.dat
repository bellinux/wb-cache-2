It <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>true</b> that even purely human-generated translations are prone to error; therefore, to ensure that a machine-generated translation will be useful to a human being and that publishable-quality translation is achieved, such translations must be reviewed and edited by a human.|$|E
25|$|However, this is {{certainly}} not entirely true. Gerard cannot have spent much, if any time in prison, as he was appointed permanent counsel by the City of London in October 1554, and represented Wigan in the English parliament {{for the third time}} in 1555. Nor can he have incurred the wrath of Mary, as he was made a Serjeant-at-law, one of a small and extremely powerful group of barristers with exclusive rights to work in the Court of Common Pleas towards the end of her reign - an appointment that lapsed on her death. He was made Justice of the Peace in five counties by 1559, many of them probably in Mary's reign: Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Cheshire and Huntingdonshire. However, it <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>true</b> that Gerard was much favoured by Elizabeth and one of a small group of lawyers who were quickly installed in important offices to consolidate the new regime.|$|E
500|$|It <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>true</b> that Shostakovich borrows {{extensively}} {{from the}} material and styles both of earlier composers and of popular music; the vulgarity of [...] "low" [...] music is a notable influence on this [...] "greatest of eclectics". [...] McBurney traces this to the avant-garde artistic circles of the early Soviet period in which Shostakovich moved early in his career, and argues that these borrowings were a deliberate technique {{to allow him to}} create [...] "patterns of contrast, repetition, exaggeration" [...] that gave his music the large-scale structure it required.|$|E

500|$|It {{is unclear}} when William McKinley began to seriously prepare {{a run for}} president. As Phillips notes, [...] "no documents, no diaries, no {{confidential}} letters to Mark Hanna (or anyone else) contain his secret hopes or veiled stratagems." [...] From the beginning, McKinley's preparations had the participation of Hanna, whose biographer William T. Horner noted, [...] "what <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>true</b> is that in 1888 the two men began to develop a close working relationship that helped put McKinley in the White House." [...] Sherman did not run for president again after 1888, and so Hanna could support McKinley's ambitions for that office wholeheartedly.|$|E
500|$|The {{story of}} Cynicism {{traditionally}} begins with Antisthenes (c. 445–365 BC), {{who was an}} older contemporary of Plato and a pupil of Socrates. [...] At about 25 years his junior, Antisthenes {{was one of the}} most important of Socrates' disciples. [...] Although later classical authors had little doubt about labelling him as the founder of Cynicism, his philosophical views seem to be more complex than the later simplicities of pure Cynicism. [...] In the list of works ascribed to Antisthenes by Diogenes Laërtius, writings on language, dialogue and literature far outnumber those on ethics or politics, although they may reflect how his philosophical interests changed with time. It <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>true</b> that Antisthenes preached a life of poverty: ...|$|E

[...] Hervik wrote, [...] "While it <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>true</b> that the prime minister {{did not have a}} legal right to intervene in the editorial process, he could have publicly (as an enactment of free speech) dissociated himself from the publication, from the content of the cartoons, from Rose's explanatory text, from Jyllands-Postens editorial of the same day, and from the general association of Islam with terrorism.

500|$|Many of {{the junior}} {{officers}} in the flank parties had difficulty stopping their exhausted, enraged men from killing everyone they found inside these buildings. For example, two innocent drunks who refused {{to hide in the}} basement of a tavern in Menotomy were killed only because they were suspected of being involved with the day's events. Although many of the accounts of ransacking and burnings were exaggerated later by the colonists for propaganda value (and to get financial compensation from the colonial government), it <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>true</b> that taverns along the road were ransacked and the liquor stolen by the troops, who in some cases became drunk themselves. [...] One church's communion silver was stolen but was later recovered after it was sold in Boston. [...] Aged Menotomy resident Samuel Whittemore killed three regulars before he was attacked by a British contingent and left for dead. [...] (He recovered from his wounds and later died in 1793 at age 98.) [...] All told, far more blood was shed in Menotomy and Cambridge than elsewhere that day. The colonists lost 25 men killed and nine wounded there, and the British lost 40 killed and 80 wounded, with the 47th Foot and the Marines suffering the highest casualties. [...] Each was about half the day's fatalities.|$|E
2500|$|In most English houses {{today the}} {{original}} intention has been lost, and these rooms have usually become a meaningless succession of drawing rooms; this <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>true</b> at both Wilton House and Blenheim Palace. [...] The {{reason for this}} is that, over time, the traditional occupants of the state bedrooms began to prefer the comfort of a warmer, more private bedroom on a quiet floor with an en-suite bathroom. [...] By the Edwardian Period, large house-parties had adapted the state rooms to use as salons for playing bridge, dancing, talking, and generally amusing themselves.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were some}} {{modernization}} {{efforts by the}} late 19th century prior to annexation. Seoul became the first city in East Asia to have electricity, trolley cars, water, telephone, and telegraph systems {{all at the same}} time, but Korea remained a largely backward agricultural economy around the start of the 20th century. [...] "Japan's initial colonial policy was to increase agricultural production in Korea to meet Japan's growing need for rice. Japan also began to build large-scale industries in Korea in the 1930s as part of the empire-wide program of economic self-sufficiency and war preparation." [...] In terms of exports, [...] "Japanese industry as a whole gained little... and this <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>true</b> for the most important manufacturing sector, cotton textiles. This export trade had little impact, positive or negative, on the welfare of Japanese consumer." [...] Likewise in terms of the profitability of Japanese investors: colonial Korea made no significant impact.|$|E

2500|$|Christian Science Monitor {{staff writer}} Dan Murphy interviewed the {{spokeswoman}} for the Red Cross, Cecilia Goin, who said the comments were not provided in full context and thus gave the inaccurate impression [...] "that everything was OK" [...] when in fact the situation was still [...] "dire." [...] Murphy, who has been to Gaza, wrote that products in supermarkets and restaurants were [...] "out of reach" [...] for most Gazans. He wrote: [...] "In this context the [...] "no humanitarian crisis" [...] means that people in Gaza aren't starving, which <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>true.</b> The United Nation's Relief and Works Agency provides aid to most of Gaza's 1.5 million people, and {{has been allowed to}} bring in food and medical supplies. The Red Cross and other aid groups are active as well." [...] He also noted that a 2008 United States diplomatic cable released by Wikileaks stated that [...] "Israeli officials have confirmed to Embassy officials on multiple occasions that they intend to keep the Gazan economy functioning at the lowest level possible consistent with avoiding a humanitarian crisis".|$|E
2500|$|Now {{that more}} {{is known about}} the trends in {{empirical}} measures of profitability, the debate focuses more on the underlying concepts. Simon Mohun states that the rate of profit is [...] "most easily measured as the proportion of net output not returned as wages to the aggregate fixed capital stock" [...] and that it is this rate of profit that is [...] "generally used in empirical work". If the growth of the gross profit component of value-added (P) is statistically compared with the growth of the estimated fixed capital stock plus inventory holdings (C), it <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>true</b> that almost all measures will show that the ratio P/C does drop over time. The real value of the physical capital stock appears to grow faster in real terms than the real value of the operating surplus associated with that physical stock, in the long run. The same effect persists even when various different depreciation techniques are used. The data trend is analogous to a rising tendency of the capital coefficient, where in the course of time more and more capital is required to obtain each additional increase in output. The profit rate rises again, only after a major crisis or a war which destroys a sufficiently large amount of capital value, raises the rate of surplus value, and clears the way for new production techniques.|$|E
