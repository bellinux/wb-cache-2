5|$|Branca {{began the}} game by {{retiring}} the first three batters; Eddie Stanky and Alvin Dark flied out while Don Mueller <b>grounded</b> out. In {{the bottom of the}} first, Carl Furillo <b>grounded</b> out, and Pee Wee Reese hit a single. After Duke Snider flied out, Reese was caught stealing second base to end the inning. In the second inning, Branca retired all three hitters; when the Dodgers came up to bat, Jackie Robinson flied out and Roy Campanella <b>grounded</b> out. Andy Pafko scored the game's first run with a home run to left field to make the score 1–0. After the third out, Willie Mays walked to start the third inning, and after the first out Stanky got the Giants' first hit, a single. After a fly out by Dark, the Giants remained without a run; Hearn retired all three batters {{in the bottom of the}} third to end the inning.|$|E
5|$|Determined {{to prevent}} the Dutch from {{refloating}} the <b>grounded</b> ships, Admiral Pellew ordered landing parties to assemble in the boats of his squadron alongside Terpsichore. From there, under distant covering fire from the British frigates, Fleetwood Pellew led the boats against Phoenix, coming under fire from the <b>grounded</b> vessels and gun batteries ashore. Passing through the bombardment from the shoreline, Pellew's men boarded Phoenix {{to find that the}} Dutch crew had just abandoned the vessel, scuttling the frigate as they departed. Although now useless as a ship, Phoenixs guns were turned on the other beached vessels to cover the British boats as they spread out to board and burn them. This operation was followed by the destruction of 20 <b>grounded</b> merchant ships in the harbour, although two others were successfully refloated and captured. In a final act before withdrawing to the squadron offshore, Captain Pellew set fire to the wreck of Phoenix, burning the ship to the waterline. The entire operation was conducted under heavy fire from the shore, but British casualties were only one Royal Marine killed and three men wounded.|$|E
5|$|On 18 October, Kronprinz was {{slightly}} <b>grounded,</b> though {{the damage was}} not serious enough to necessitate withdrawal for repairs. By 20 October, the fighting on the islands was winding down; Moon, Ösel, and Dagö were in German possession. The previous day, the Admiralstab had ordered the cessation of naval actions {{and the return of}} the dreadnoughts to the High Seas Fleet as soon as possible. On the 26th, Kronprinz was more seriously <b>grounded</b> on the return trip to Kiel. She managed to reach Kiel on 2 November, and subsequently Wilhelmshaven. Repairs were effected from 24 November to 8 January.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the attack, Diệm ordered that all VNAF {{aircraft}} be <b>grounded,</b> and all aerial combat missions suspended while his security officials investigated fighter pilots for any possible anti-regime tendencies.

50|$|<b>Ground</b> loops - When <b>grounding</b> a circuit, it is {{important}} to avoid <b>ground</b> loops. <b>Ground</b> loops occur when there is a voltage drop between the two <b>ground</b> potentials. Since <b>ground</b> is thought of as 0 V, the presence of a voltage is undesirable at any point of a <b>ground</b> bus. If this is the case, {{it would not be a}} true <b>ground.</b> A good way to fix this is to bring all the <b>ground</b> wires to the same potential in a <b>ground</b> bus.|$|R

5|$|For {{nearly two}} weeks the French frigates {{remained}} at anchor, Malcolm and Grant drawing up plans for an attack with fireships, when Amazone successfully slipped out of harbour on 27 November, returning successfully to Le Havre before dawn the following day. With Amazone gone, Grant maintained a closer watch on Elisa, calling up a bomb vessel to attack the anchorage on 6 December. This proved no more accurate than the rockets, but Elisa was again driven into shallow waters to avoid the attack, this time becoming irretrievably <b>grounded</b> on a shoal. Over {{the next two weeks}} Elisa remained <b>grounded,</b> the frigate gradually being reduced to the state of a total wreck. On 23 December Grant sent his boats, commanded by Lieutenant Thomas Rowe, into the anchorage under cover of darkness and set the wreck on fire to ensure that the frigate's stores could not be salvaged.|$|E
