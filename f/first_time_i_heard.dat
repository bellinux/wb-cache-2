25|$|On October 17, 2017 Frank Ocean's dad, Calvin Cooksey, sued Frank {{on charges}} of {{defamation}} and other damages with restitution payments reaching up to 14.5 million dollars. The issue started when Frank Ocean wrote a post in his personal Tumblr responding to the Pulse Nightclub shooting back in June 2016 and told {{a story about how}} when he was a kid, he heard his father use a transphobic slur towards a waitress. The post stated that:'I was six years old when I heard my dad call our transgender waitress a f***** as he dragged me out a neighborhood diner saying we wouldn’t be served because she was dirty. 'That was the last afternoon I saw my father and the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> that word, I think, although it wouldn’t shock me if it wasn’t. Many hate us and wish we didn’t exist.' The judge ended up ruling in favor of Frank Ocean and the case was put to an end.|$|E

As the beat started I was transported somewhere else. Her voice, the imagery, the huge drum sound: it seemed to capture everything for me. As a songwriter you're constantly chasing that feeling". Rufus Wainwright named Bush as one of his top ten gay icons. Outside music, Bush has been an inspiration to several fashion designers, including Hussein Chalayan.|$|E
500|$|Although {{they had}} ample opportunity, {{at no time}} did any of them even hint that [...] "Earnest" [...] was a synonym for {{homosexual}}, or that [...] "bunburying" [...] may have implied homosexual sex. The <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> it mentioned was in the 1980s and I immediately consulted Sir John Gielgud whose own performance of Jack Worthing in the same play was legendary and whose knowledge of theatrical lore was encyclopaedic.

To be honest, I was a little worried when it first came out and it wasn’t doing great. But I think it’s just about working hard and getting people to hear the song, and then everyone started believing in it a little bit more. I remember getting a text from Keith Urban saying 'I’m not gonna lie: The <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> that song I wasn’t crazy about it. But after a couple listens, I really, really like it.' And I mean, I think that’s how everybody felt about the song. And I think that’s a testament to a good song. You don’t have to love ‘em the first time you hear ‘em. It grew on people." ...|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} for Rowland’s segment in the iheartradio concert series, {{it was revealed that}} [...] "Rose Colored Glasses" [...] had made Rowland cry. [...] She said “the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> the song it made me think of all of the relationships where I had to wear rose colored glasses,” in particular noting her past “toxic relationships” and “situations where I needed to leave” as the causes of her Rowland’s tears. Later it was revealed that the song had made Rowland’s vocals swell. During {{an interview}} for The Belfast Telegraph, Rowland spoke of the songs she had recorded for her third studio album. When speaking of [...] "Rose Colored Glasses", she said that it had taken its toll on her, “It brought back a few memories, and when I recorded it I cried so much my vocal chords got swollen." [...] She also expressed her pleasure at being able to sing about her experiences.|$|E
500|$|Branch's {{music has}} gained {{prominence}} {{as a result}} of its use during the 2012 Republican presidential primary. When she was performing [...] "I Am America" [...] at events across the country, Herman Cain was often the keynote speaker. Branch and her husband came to appreciate his political views and her husband signed on with Cain's campaign. [...] "I Am America" [...] was later adopted by the candidate as his campaign's official theme. Cain said when interviewed about the song, [...] "The <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> that song, the message was so right-on I felt goose bumps just listening to it." [...] The song was later described by the National Journal as having [...] "underscored Cain's anti-elitist appeal" [...] with its lyrics. Campaign ads featuring [...] "I Am America" [...] gave the song increased exposure. A campaign ad using [...] "I Am America" [...] that included Cain's chief of staff was the subject of numerous parodies also featuring the song. On The Colbert Report, comedian Stephen Colbert satirically claimed Cain got the line [...] "I Am America" [...] from Colbert's book, I Am America (And So Can You!). Several parodies of the ad were then shown on the program using the song.|$|E

500|$|The {{recording}} and mixing of [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] {{took place in}} summer and autumn of 2008. After Rowland heard the instrumental of [...] "When Love Takes Over"—a piano loop-based melody with throbbing percussion—she asked Guetta if she could take the demo and several other tracks to work on. She wrote the lyrics and recorded the vocals in London, within a day. She was aided by Australian songwriters and producers Miriam and Olivia Nervo (The Nervo Twins). However the song remained unfinished until Guetta rediscovered the track while compiling his One Love album. After getting selected for the album, [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] was given to Frédéric Riesterer who, aside from producing the song with Guetta, was tasked the final audio mixing of the song. However Riesterer decided to give the track to French mixing engineer Veronica Ferraro, who would later go {{on to say that}} [...] "Reisterer was supposed to mix it, but he wanted me to do it and see how it turned out. The <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> the track I immediately knew it would be a huge hit."

500|$|Louder Now {{received}} {{a score of}} 64 out of 100 from Metacritic, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews." [...] AbsolutePunk founder Jason Tate considered the album [...] "closer to Northstar's Pollyanna" [...] than to Where You Want to Be, {{and said that the}} music wasn't [...] "anything mind-blowing. I don't get knocked on my ass like I did the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> TAYF, but the catchy repetitiveness is all there." [...] AllMusic reviewer Corey Apar called the album's name [...] "an apt title for a super-tight, aggressive album that falls somewhere between their last two, tapping the heartfelt vigor of Tell All Your Friends in order to give Where You Want to Be a swift, square kick in the pants." [...] Scott Heisel wrote for Alternative Press that the band [...] " [...] spot-on when they floor it or put it in park; it’s the sputtering along in-between that hurts the record." [...] Despite not mastering [...] "the art of the middle ground," [...] they take [...] "immense leaps forward musically on their third album." [...] According to Heisel, the band should be [...] "commended, not for just choosing not to rehash their older work, but for truly trying to branch out artistically—and succeeding most of the time." ...|$|E
500|$|Rowland has {{acknowledged}} {{on several occasions}} that although she loved dance music, it was not really the type of music she would record. While in Europe in 2008, she met Guetta {{at one of his}} DJ shows in Southern France and commented that [...] "Listening to him was just crazy." [...] Guetta was playing the instrumental version of [...] "When Love Takes Over". Recalling that it brought tears to her eyes, Rowland remarked, [...] "I felt so much emotion from the track; something happened the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> it, and it was just beautiful. And I remember thinking 'Why is this touching me like this?' You know, it was like there was a kinda soul-tie to it!" [...] Upon meeting Guetta, she asked him for the song so she could write its lyrics. [...] "So I met David and asked him for the track... He gave it to me, and I brought it back here to London, UK and wrote the actual song". At a writing session in a London hotel room, Rowland and songwriting duo Nervo wrote the lyrics and melody over Guetta's backing track. Rowland later joined Guetta and Julie Terry Lefèvre-Han in the recording studio to finish off the song.|$|E

500|$|Although Chelsea Girl is well-regarded {{by music}} critics, Nico was {{dissatisfied}} with it: [...] "The <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> the album, I cried. I still cannot listen to it, because everything I wanted for that record, {{they took it}} away." [...] Jim Morrison, whom Nico later called [...] " [...] soul brother", encouraged her to write her own songs; this was [...] "a key breakthrough for [...] ". They were together in California in July and August 1967, often driving into the desert and experimenting with peyote. Morrison, who encouraged Nico to write down her dreams, read Mary Shelley, William Blake and Samuel Taylor Coleridge to her. He recorded his chemical visions and dreams, using the material for his songs as he imagined the opium-addicted Coleridge had worked. In 1986 Nico said, [...] "He taught me to write songs. I never thought that I could... He really inspired me a lot. It was like looking in a mirror then." [...] She began writing her own material and performing it to an intimate audience at Steve Paul's club, the Scene. Nico composed her music on a harmonium bought, according to Richard Witts, from a San Francisco hippie; manager Danny Fields recalled, [...] "I think Leonard Cohen may have given it to her, or {{had something to do}} with her getting it." [...] With that instrument, [...] "she discovered not only her own artistic voice but a whole new realm of sound." [...] The droning pump organ became her trademark.|$|E
500|$|The {{release of}} a single was soon deemed a [...] "stupid idea" [...] by Cornell and dropped {{in favor of an}} EP or album. The album was {{recorded}} in only 15 days, produced by the band themselves. Gossard described the recording process as a [...] "non-pressure-filled" [...] situation, as there were no expectations or pressure coming from the record company. Eddie Vedder, who had flown up from San Diego to Seattle to audition for Ament, Gossard, and McCready to be the singer of a band initially billing themselves as Mookie Blaylock (so named for a basketball player but eventually settling on Pearl Jam), was at one of the Temple of the Dog rehearsals and ended up providing backing vocals. [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became a duet between Cornell and Vedder. Cornell was still figuring out the vocals at practice when Vedder stepped in and filled in the blanks singing the low parts because he saw it was hard for Cornell, as Cornell later described it: [...] "He sang half of that song not even knowing that I'd wanted the part to be there and he sang it exactly the way I was thinking about doing it, just instinctively." [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became Temple of the Dog's breakout single; it was also Vedder's first featured vocal on a record. On the 2011 documentary Pearl Jam Twenty, Vedder stated; “That was the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> myself on a real record. It could be one of my favorite songs that I’ve ever been on — or the most meaningful.” ...|$|E

In an interview with News.com.au, Guetta spoke about its leak, saying, [...] "You shouldn't even know about that...I'd rather not speak about it. That was annoying. It wasn't supposed to be out there." [...] Sia recorded a demo of the song, which was then sent to Blige and other artists. Eventually, Guetta decided {{to stay with her}} version. He explained, [...] "The <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> what Sia did, because she was not in the studio with me, I fell in love with it...I didn't even want to give it to anyone else; it was perfect the way it was. It's not only about how big you are in America, it's about the song and the voice." [...] American pop singer Katy Perry {{was the first person to}} be offered the track but turned it down because she felt its message was too similar to that of her song [...] "Firework". An insider told Take 40 Australia, [...] "So that 'Titanium' song, Sia wrote it for Katy, but [...] didn't want to do a song with Guetta..." [...] According to Sia's manager, Jonathan Daniel of Crush Management, Sia wrote the song for American R singer Alicia Keys. Guetta considered approaching other female singers to record on the song, however Perry advised him to keep Sia on the track. Guetta ultimately followed this suggestion. Sia revealed that Guetta put her vocals on the song without asking for permission: ...|$|E

Rowland said there were initially two songs in the running for the lead single, but [...] "without a doubt we had to go with , I just fell in love with it... It's definitely a club banger.

[...] At Pat Field's Disco Party in New York, she told Universal Music Group executives [...] "I know in my gut that it felt good. Nobody could take my thoughts away from that. I doesn't need anyone else to tell me it's good". The song was released on May 17 and May 18, 2010 to the iTunes Stores, in France and the United States, respectively. The official extended dance remix was released alongside the main single on May 18, 2010. In the United Kingdom, [...] "Commander" [...] was planned for a June 28, 2010 release. Love and Rowland would later unveil plans for an urban mix of the song with a slower, smoother sound. American rapper Nelly heard the new version in its early stages and asked if he could be featured on the remix. It was released as part of the UK Remixes EP. as well as the second U.S. remixes EP. The official press from Universal Motown Records on May 19, 2010 confirmed that [...] "Commander" [...] would serve only as the [...] "international lead single", leading to speculation another song would be released domestically. This speculation was confirmed when the Ne-Yo-penned, [...] "Shake Them Haters Off" [...] was set to impact on radio stations in the United States. However those plans were changed and on June 29, 2010 two singles were serviced to impact in the United States.
