The epizootic resulted in documented mortality of 18 % and estimated mortality of 26 % of the waterfowl at risk.

Losses during the epizootic were equivalent to 0. 12 % of the annual mortality in the North American 1996 fall population of 80, 000, 000 wild ducks.

40|$|<b>Duck</b> <b>plague</b> (DP) is {{a severe}} disease caused by DP virus (DPV). Control {{of the disease}} is {{recognized}} as one of the biggest chal-lenges in avian medicine. Vaccination is an efficient way to control DPV, and an attenuated vaccine is the main routine vaccine. The attenuated DPV vaccine strain CHa is a modified live vaccine, but the systemic andmucosal immune responses induced by this vaccine have been poorly understood. In this study, the immunogenicity and efficacy of the vaccine were evaluated after sub-cutaneous immunization of ducks. CD 4 and CD 8 T cells were counted by flow cytometry, and humoral andmucosal Ig anti-bodies were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results showed that high levels of T cells and Ig anti-bodies were present postimmunization and that there were more CD 4 T cells than CD 8 T cells. Titers of humoral IgG were higher than those of humoral IgA. Local IgA was found in each sample, whereas local IgG was found only in the spleen, thymus, bursa of Fabricius, harderian gland, liver, bile, and lung. In a protection assay, the attenuated DPV vaccine completely protected ducks against 1, 000 50 % lethal doses (LD 50) of the lethal DPV strain CHv via oral infection. These data suggest that this subcuta-neous vaccine elicits sufficient systemic andmucosal immune responses against lethal DPV challenge to be protective in ducks.

The ducklings were equally divided into five groups (A, B, C, D and E). Ducklings of group A and B were primarily vaccinated with 0. 5 ml and 1. 0 ml of DLS-DPV respectively and those of group C and D were primarily vaccinated with 0. 5 ml and 1. 0 ml of BAU-DPV. The ducklings of group E were kept as unvaccinated control. Five months after primary vaccination all the ducks of vaccinated groups were boosted with 1. 0 ml of DLS-DPV and BAU-DPV and 21 days after booster vaccination all the ducks of vaccinated and control groups were challenged with 1 ml of 10 4 EID 50 of virulent field isolate of <b>duck</b> <b>plague</b> virus (DPV). The level of immunity developed in different vaccinated groups of ducks was measured by passive hemagglutination (PHA) test.

The diagnosis of DP currently relies {{on the use of}} live or inactivated whole DPV virion as antigens in ELISA, but it is too laborious and expensive for routine application, and it is still difficult to get purified DPV virion with current technology. Results In this study, we describe the expression and purification of a recombinant Thymidine Kinase (TK) protein which makes antigen in an in-house developed, optimized and standardized ELISA. The specificity of the optimized TK-ELISA was evaluated by antisera against <b>Duck</b> <b>Plague</b> Virus (DPV), Duck Hepatitis B Virus (DHBV), Duck Hepatitis Virus (DHV), Riemerella Anatipestifer (R. A), Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Salmonella anatum (S. anatum). Only antisera against DPV yielded a specific and strong signal. In order to determine the sensitivity of the TK-ELISA, a panel of diluted sera was tested, and the minimum detection limit of 1 : 2560 (OD 450 nm = 0. 401) was obtained according to the endpoint cut-off (0. 2438). The repeatability and reproducibility under the experimental conditions demonstrates a low variability (P > 0. 05). The suspected sera samples (n = 30) were determined by TK-ELISA and the positive rate is 90 % (27 / 30), and the TK-ELISA showed 83. 33 % (22 + 3 / 30) coincidence rate with the Serum Neutralization Test (SNT) and 90 % (24 + 3 / 30) coincidence rate with the whole DPV virion based-ELISA (DPV-ELISA). When defining the dynamics of antibody response to attenuated live DPV vaccine, the maximum antibodies is reached after 4 weeks. Conclusions The results suggest that the TK-ELISA provides high specificity, sensitivity, repeatability and reproducibility for detection of anti-DPV antibodies in duck sera, and {{has the potential to be}} much simpler than DPV-ELISA and SNT for the sera epidemiological investigation. </p...|$|E

In this study, Cherry Valley duck MAVS (duMAVS) was cloned from the spleen and analyzed. duMAVS was determined to have a caspase activation and recruitment domain at N-terminal, followed by a proline rich domain and a transmembrane domain at C-terminal. Quantitative real time PCR indicated that duMAVS was expressed in all tissues tested across a broad expression spectrum. The expression of duMAVS was significantly up-regulated after infection with duck Tembusu virus. Overexpression of duMAVS could drive the activation of interferon-β, nuclear factor-κB, interferon regulatory factor 7, and many downstream factors (such as Mx, PKR, OAS, and IL- 8) in duck embryo fibroblast cells.

Results: The recombinant gE protein was highly immunogenicity by ELISA, and the gE was used as an antigen for the preparation of polyclonal antibody, which could be used the first antibody for further experiment to study the distribution of DPV gE protein in DPV-infected tissues by indirect immunofluorescence assay. DPV gE protein were distributed in the immune organs (thymus, bursa of fabricius (BF), Harders glands, spleen), the digestive organs (liver, duodenum, jejunum, ileum), and the other parenchymatous organs (kidney, myocardium, cerebrum, and lung) of DPV-infected ducks, but the positive immunofluorescence signal was not seen in the muscle and pancreas. The lymphocytes, reticulum cells, macrophages, epithelial cells, and hepatocytes served as the principal site for the localization of DPV gE antigen. Moreover, the intensity of fluorescence increased sharply from 12 t...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The role of {{migrating}} {{wild birds}} in transmitting diseases of poultry or zoonoses is a contentious issue as the researchers and naturalists stands divided regarding their capability to disperse pathogens over continents. Recently, migratory birds got world wide attention during the bird flu outbreaks, {{as they were}} found capable to disseminate the deadly H 5 N 1 avian influenza (bird flu) virus, without themselves getting affected. However, the death of migratory birds due to H 5 N 1, reported from Asia, has fuelled anxiety and concern over the whole issue. Apart from avian influenza, migratory birds are also thought to play role in the transmission of avian viruses like Newcastle disease virus, avian pneumovirus and <b>duck</b> <b>plague</b> virus. Similarly, bacterial pathogens like Chlamydophila psittaci and Pasteurella multocida can be transmitted to domestic poultry via migratory birds. They are also known to spread West Nile virus, equine encephalitis virus, Borrelia burgdorferi and enteropathogens like Campylobacter and Salmonella, which could affect animals as will as human beings. To prevent such etiological agents from entering poultry premises, strict biosecurity and constant surveillance are of paramount importance. Hence, in the scenario of migratory birds contributing significantly to the global spread of infectious diseases, {{a better understanding of}} their role in the disease epidemiology has to be gained by implementing superior surveillance and tracking strategies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Village poultry play a {{vital role}} in many poor rural households. They provide scarce animal protein (in the form of meat and eggs) and can be sold/bartered to meet {{essential}} family needs such as medicine, clothes and school fees. They also provide manure and pest control as well as being used in traditional ceremonies. Village poultry are generally owned and managed by women and children and improving their production can provide the first step out of poverty for the rural poor. The Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) has supported village poultry research in many countries since 1984. This research has had some significant outcomes including: the control of Newcastle disease (ND) using Australian derived live thermotolerant vaccines in a variety of poultry production systems in several countries; description and quantification of the scavenging feed resource base of low input/low output systems; development of gender-sensitive extension materials and methodologies suitable for use in remote rural areas in Asia and Africa; and the development and registration of a new <b>duck</b> <b>plague</b> vaccine in Viet Nam. The thermotolerant ND I- 2 vaccine remains viable for periods away from the cold chain, can be administered by various routes and induces an acceptable level of protection under village conditions. The vaccine master seed, together with the ND Laboratory Manual, is made available without cost by ACIAR...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The gE protein of <b>duck</b> <b>plague</b> {{virus is}} the {{important}} membrane glycoprotein, its protein characterization has not been reported. In this study, we expressed and presented the characterization of the DPV gE product. Results According to the sequence of the gE gene, a pair of primers were designed, and the DNA product with 1490 bp in size was amplified by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR product was cloned into pMD 18 -T vector, and subcloned into pET 32 a(+), generating the recombinant plasmid pET 32 a/DPV-gE. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the fusion pET 32 a/DPV-gE protein was highly expressed after induction by 0. 2 mM IPTG at 30 °C for 4. 5 h in Rosseta host cells. Over expressed 6 ×His-gE fusion protein was purified by nickel affinity chromatography, and used to immunize the rabbits for the preparation of polyclonal antibody. The result of the intracellular localization revealed that the gE protein was {{appeared to be in}} the cytoplasm region. The real time PCR, RT-PCR analysis and Western blotting revealed that the gE gene was produced most abundantly during the late phase of replication in DPV-infected cells. Conclusions In this work, the DPV gE protein was successfully expressed in a prokaryotic expression system, and we presented the basic properties of the DPV gE product for the first time. These properties of the gE protein provided a prerequisite for further functional analysis of this gene. </p...|$|E
40|$|Since April 2010, Tembusu virus (TMUV) {{which is}} a {{contagious}} pathogen of waterfowls, causing symptoms of high fever, loss of appetite and fall in egg production, {{has been reported in}} east of China. A double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) which detects for TMUV was developed, using two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the TMUV envelope (E) protein. BALB/c mice were immunized with purified recombinant E protein expressed in E. coli. Three hybridoma cell lines designated as 12 B 1, 10 C 6 and 2 D 2, were screened by cell fusion and indirect ELISA for their ability to recognize different linear epitopes on the E protein, and were characterized subsequently. High-affinity mAbs 12 B 1 and 2 D 2 were used as capture and detection antibodies, respectively. The reaction conditions for the DAS-ELISA were optimized for TMUV detection. The cross-reactivity of the DAS-ELISA was determined using TMUV, <b>duck</b> <b>plague</b> virus, avian influenza virus subtype H 9, Newcastle disease virus, duck hepatitis A virus type 1 and duck reovirus samples. A total of 191 homogenized tissues of field samples were simultaneously detected by DAS-ELISA and by RT-PCR. The former was found to have a high specificity of 99. 1 % and a sensitivity of 93. 1 %. These results reveal a positive coincidence between DAS-ELISA and RT-PCR at a coincidence rate of 95. 8 %. The method developed in this study can be used for the diagnosis of TMUV infection of duck origin...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{work by the}} U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service {{identified}} nutrients, elemental contaminants, algal toxins, bacterial pathogens, and hormones as contaminants {{of concern}} (COCs) associated with wetlands created from the secondary effluent of a large swine concentrated animal feeding operation. In this follow-up study, COC exposure and effects to waterfowl were evaluated using game farm mallards. Mallards were kept in enclosures built on two created wetlands (treatment sites) and two reference wetlands that are federally managed for waterfowl habitat. Water quality in the created wetland enclosures had higher specific conductivity, BOD, turbidity, pH, and nutrients than reference wetlands. Algal blooms frequently occurred in the created wetlands and included Microcystis spp. All sentinel mallards tested negative for <b>duck</b> <b>plague</b> and avian influenza; however, an avian botulism outbreak on the created wetlands occurred in August of 2003 after the study was completed. Cumulative stress from poor water quality and reproduction may have caused hen mortality in the created wetland enclosures, resulting in a greater survival to hatch in the reference wetlands compared to created wetlands. However, wild brood production was observed in the created wetlands. There {{were no significant differences}} in sentinel mallard blood plasma chemistry and histology biomarkers between reference and created wetland enclosures. Known toxicity thresholds were only exceeded for selenium concentrations in liver, and included sentinel mallards on reference and created wetland enclosures. It is recommended that a constructed wetland system is developed to further treat Hastings Pork secondary swine wastewater before it is delivered to habitat wetlands for migratory waterfowl...|$|E
40|$|Background: The <b>duck</b> <b>plague</b> virus (DPV) UL 46 protein (VP 11 / 12) is a 739 -amino acid {{tegument}} protein encoded by the UL 46 gene. We {{analyzed the}} {{amino acid sequence}} of UL 46 using bioinformatics tools and defined the main antigenic domains to be between nucleotides 700 - 2, 220 in the UL 46 sequence. This region was designated UL 46 M. The DPV UL 46 and UL 46 M genes were both expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE 3) induced by isopropy 1 -β-Dthiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) following polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and subcloning into the prokaryotic expression vector pET 32 a(+). The recombinant proteins were purified using a Ni-NTA spin column and used to generate the polyclonal antibody against UL 46 and UL 46 M in New Zealand white rabbits. The titer was then tested using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and agar diffusion reaction, and the specificity was tested by western blot analysis. Subsequently, we established Dot-ELISA using the polyclonal antibody and applied it to DPV detection. Results: In our study, the DPV UL 46 M fusion protein, with a relative molecular mass of 79 kDa, was expressed in E. coli Rosetta (DE 3). Expression of the full UL 46 gene failed, which {{was consistent with the}} results from the bioinformatic analysis. The expressed product was directly purified using Ni-NTA spin column to prepare the polyclonal antibody against UL 46 M. The titer of the anti-UL 46 M antisera was over 1 : 819, 200 as determined by ELISA and 1 : 8 by aga...|$|E
40|$|Interferons are a {{group of}} {{antiviral}} cytokines acting as {{the first line of}} defense in the antiviral immunity. Here, we describe the antiviral activity of goose type I interferon (IFNα) and type II interferon (IFNγ) against <b>duck</b> <b>plague</b> virus (DPV). Recombinant goose IFNα and IFNγ proteins of approximately 20 kDa and 18 kDa, respectively, were expressed. Following DPV-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) infection of duck embryo fibroblast cells (DEFs) with IFNα and IFNγ pre-treatment, the number of viral gene copies decreased more than 100 -fold, with viral titers dropping approximately 100 -fold. Compared to the control, DPV-EGFP cell positivity was decreased by goose IFNα and IFNγ at 36 hpi (3. 89 %; 0. 79 %) and 48 hpi (17. 05 %; 5. 58 %). In accordance with interferon-stimulated genes being the “workhorse” of IFN activity, the expression of duck myxovirus resistance (Mx) and oligoadenylate synthetases-like (OASL) was significantly upregulated (p < 0. 001) by IFN treatment for 24 h. Interestingly, duck cells and goose cells showed a similar trend of increased ISG expression after goose IFNα and IFNγ pretreatment. Another interesting observation is that the positive feedback regulation of type I IFN and type II IFN by goose IFNα and IFNγ was confirmed in waterfowl for the first time. These results suggest that the antiviral activities of goose IFNα and IFNγ can likely be attributed to the potency with which downstream genes are induced by interferon. These findings will contribute to our understanding of the functional significance of the interferon antiviral system in aquatic birds and to the development of interferon-based prophylactic and therapeutic approaches against viral disease...|$|E
