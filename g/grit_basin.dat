40|$|Stone and Webster Engineering Corporation has {{prepared}} a preliminary hydraulic {{design of the}} Colorado River Water Supply Project for the UNOCAL Corporation. Of particular concern was the area extending from a proposed pumping station to a proposed <b>grit</b> <b>basin</b> on the Colorado River near Grand Valley. The <b>grit</b> <b>basin</b> {{is used as a}} settling pond to remove the sediment carried by the river. UNOCAL Energy Mining Divisio...|$|E
5000|$|Beneath a {{waterfall}} in the Pemigewasset River is a granite pothole about 20 ft across {{known simply as}} [...] "the Basin". It was scrubbed out by stones dragged (and eventually deposited) by the retreating North American ice sheet, and since made smooth by 15 millennia of rapidly whirling pebbles and <b>grit.</b> Below the <b>Basin</b> is [...] "Old Man's Foot", a distinctively shaped rock formation, also the natural result of Pemigewasset's erosive energy.|$|R
5000|$|Coarse bubble {{diffusers}} produce 1/4 to 1/2 inch (6.4 to 13 mm) bubbles which rise rapidly {{from the}} floor of a wastewater treatment plant or sewage treatment plant tank. They are typically used in <b>grit</b> chambers, equalization <b>basins,</b> chlorine contact tanks, and aerobic digesters, and sometimes also in aeration tanks. Generally they are better at vertically [...] "pumping" [...] water than at mass transfer of oxygen. Coarse bubble diffusers typically provide half the mass transfer of oxygen as compared to fine bubble diffusers, given the same air volume.|$|R
