5|$|In October 2005, Gordon and Levin {{met with}} Warner Bros. {{to develop the}} film there again. Tim Burton at one point {{expressed}} interest in directing the film but ultimately turned it down. Impressed with Zack Snyder's work on 300, Warner Bros. approached him to direct an adaptation of Watchmen. Screenwriter Alex Tse drew from his favorite elements of Hayter's script, but also returned it to the original Cold War setting of the Watchmen comic. Similar to his approach to 300, Snyder used the comic book as a storyboard. Following negotiations, Paramount, which had already spent $7 million in their <b>failed</b> <b>project,</b> earned the rights for international distribution of Watchmen and 25% of the film's ownership.|$|E
5|$|The highway was {{constructed}} from1926to1935. Route31 has carried two different {{numbers in the}} past. It was known as Route30 between1927and1953, when it was renumbered to Route69 to avoid conflicting with US30 in southern New Jersey. It was renumbered to Route31 in 1967 due to sign theft that resulted from the sexual meaning of the number69. There were plans made in the late1960s and early1970s to build a freeway in the Route31 corridor that would begin in the Trenton area and extend {{as far north as}} Interstate84 (I-84) in Port Jervis, New York; however, it was canceled in the mid-1970s due to opposition from area residents and environmental and financial constraints. In recent years, the portion of Route31 between Flemington and Clinton has been widened to four lanes. In addition, there was a <b>failed</b> <b>project</b> to build a bypass of Flemington that would have also eliminated the Flemington Circle.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, the Dunstan Government {{stepped up}} its {{legislative}} efforts. Some bills, {{such as the one}} to remove the sodomy law and decriminalise male homosexuality, had been initially blocked by the Legislative Council. However, the bill to abolish capital punishment passed with ease, and the homosexuality law reforms eventually passed in September. Rape law was properly codified and defined as a crime within marriage {{for the first time in}} Australia. Shopping hours, previously the most restrictive in the nation, became the most open. Following a royal commission, Friday night shopping was introduced for the city and Thursday night shopping for the suburbs. The deposits on beverage containers was finally passed. The first signs of Monarto's eventual failure began to appear: birth rates started dropping significantly, immigration slowed and the economy was stagnant. South Australia's robust population growth, previously the highest per capita among the states, came to an abrupt halt. However, state money continued to be poured into the Monarto project, despite the fact that the Whitlam government cut funding to $600,000 in 1975, while his Liberal successor Malcolm Fraser gave nothing at all the following year. However, by the time Monarto was eventually scrapped after Dunstan's departure, no less than $20 million had been used to buy land, plant trees and formulate development plans, and the <b>failed</b> <b>project</b> is often seen as Dunstan's greatest failure. In addition, the federal government removed subsidies for shipbuilding at Whyalla, forcing the operations to be scaled down.|$|E

According to the Singapore Pork Merchants' Association, about seventy percent of the pork-consuming population preferred fresh to frozen pork at the time of the campaign. The Frozen Pork Hotline was deemed a <b>failed</b> <b>project,</b> with virtually nobody calling it. On the other hand, foreign pork merchants from countries including Australia, New Zealand and the United States were very supportive of the campaign as it would help boost their pork sales.|$|E

Successful projects get completed, are used by many people, and bring benefits to users. <b>Failed</b> <b>projects</b> do not bring similar benefits. In this work, {{we are interested in}} developing an effective machine learning solution that predicts project outcome (i. e., success or failures) from developer socio-technical network. To do so, we investigate successful and <b>failed</b> <b>projects</b> to find factors that differentiate the two. We analyze the socio-technical aspect of the software development process by focusing at the people that contribute to these projects and the interactions among them. We first form a collaboration graph for each software project. We then create a training set consisting of two graph databases corresponding to successful and <b>failed</b> <b>projects</b> respectively. A new data mining approach is then employed to extract discriminative rich patterns that appear frequently on the successful projects but rarely on the <b>failed</b> <b>projects.</b> We find that these automatically mined patterns are effective features to predict project outcomes.

500|$|The artwork for Lightning Bolt {{was made}} by Don Pendleton, who {{is best known as}} a {{skateboard}} graphic artist. Ament bought some of Pendleton's paintings [...] "in 2008 or 2009" [...] and later asked the artist to do a logo for their upcoming album, which would later develop into all the illustrations. The bassist then kept in contact with Pendleton to guide his work, sending him the song lyrics, some sketches he had done and an unmastered copy of the album. The intention was to [...] "make something that was a total package", according to Pendleton, who said that there was an attempt to bring back [...] "these classic LPs in the days where you would read the lyrics. You related the band to the imagery to the song to the lyrics." [...] Pendleton tried to [...] "keep it iconic with some symbols but also really heavy with archetypes", given the body of images could be used consistently with all of the promotion. While some of the graphics evolved directly from Ament's sketches, Pendleton took some inspiration from his past work, such as a series of skateboards he painted [...] "based around icons and logos", and the very first image sent to Ament, an eye with a lightning bolt which Pendleton made back in 2006 for a <b>failed</b> <b>project,</b> that evolved into the album cover. Said cover was painted by hand as Pendleton wanted [...] "something so geometric that there would be some flaws in it, especially compared to the vector/computer stuff". Republic Records art designer Joe Spix then handled the presentation, with particular detail in the vinyl packaging. Pendleton also painted Ament's bass, Pearl Jam-themed shirts for Volcom, and posters for the Barclays Center concerts in October 2013. At the 57th Annual Grammy Awards in February 2015, the album won the award for Best Recording Package.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{motivated}} {{by a lack of}} research on the learning from <b>failed</b> IT <b>projects</b> of IT professionals. It remains unclear whether they learn from <b>failed</b> <b>projects</b> and conduct more successful projects in the future. We investigate this research gap with a large quantitative dataset from a German IT service provider. We find that IT professionals learn from <b>failed</b> <b>projects</b> and can leverage this knowledge in the future. Therefore, they should not be seen as "losers", but as a valuable human resource. Our research contributes to the limited research of learning from failure in IT literature. We show that results that have been obtained in other domains are transferable to the IT domain. Our research is limited by the circumstance, that our dataset comes from only one IT company.

2500|$|Euphorion, Negoiţescu's <b>failed</b> <b>project</b> for a {{literary}} magazine, was also his stated attempt at producing a modernist literary manifesto. Placing his references in German Romanticism and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's Faust, the critic found the tragic figure of Euphorion (in [...] ) {{as an ideal}} image of [...] "all things new on a spiritual level". The core idea, occasionally paraphrased as Euphorionism, was defined by Negoiţescu himself {{in terms of an}} Apollonian and Dionysian opposition, with a preference for the former term, and in combination with [...] "modern Faustianism, that is to say dynamism, imprudent haste." [...] Seeing in Euphorion a victim of preference for the chaotically modern elements of his own dual nature, and indicating that Goethe had initially intended to give his character a happier and more balanced existence, the theorist stated: [...] "I shall propose as a goal that initial Euphorion [...] All contemporary Romantic decadence, the signs of crisis and disaster, such as Naturalism and Surrealism etc., are consequences of that tear within Euphorion's being.

Results confirm model predictions showing that patents associated with successfully completed projects receive more citations than those associated with <b>failed</b> <b>projects.</b> However, we also show that <b>failed</b> <b>projects</b> can be in turn cited more often than patents lacking clinical or preclinical information. We further explore the `black box' of innovation, providing evidence that both successes and failures contribute to R&D investment decisions and knowledge dynamics in science-driven sectors...|$|R
40|$|Purpose of {{the paper}} and {{literature}} addressed: Analyzing the impact of <b>failed</b> global sourcing <b>projects</b> on the entire commodity group and exploring isomorphism as potential antecedent to the observed phenomenon. The paper {{is embedded in the}} global sourcing literature, as well as isomorphism and total cost analysis. Research method: Secondary data analysis. Research findings: 1) Each <b>failed</b> global sourcing <b>project</b> had an “ugly twin”, i. e. the material which was not delivered by the new supplier had to be purchased from another supplier, usually the old supplier which was meant to be replaced. This re-sourcing was associated with poorer commercial conditions. 2) Higher savings expectations corresponded with lower realization rate. We interpret this finding as an expression of the presence of mimetic isomorphism. Main contribution: Exposing the “ugly twins” and empirically testing the isomorphism assumption. Findings ask to expand total cost calculations by including the costs of <b>failed</b> <b>projects.</b> Global sourcing benefits may be over-estimated by previous studies, as they do not seem to deduce the costs of <b>failed</b> <b>projects</b> from overall savings. Firms are alerted that unrealistically high savings expectations are very likely to result in disappointment. Thus projects should preferably be avoided...|$|R
