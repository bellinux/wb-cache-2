5|$|Although only an {{alternate}} {{member of the}} tribunal without a vote, <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> heard {{in all of its}} deliberations, his hand drafted a large and most important part of its judgment, and no one connected with the tribunal, member or otherwise, had a greater part than he in shaping the final result.
