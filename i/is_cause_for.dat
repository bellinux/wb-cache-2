25|$|The city {{area has}} {{increased}} considerably along with passage of time. It has stretched from Hiranagar to Dhalli {{from one side}} & from Tara Devi to Malyana in the other. As per the 2001 India Census, the city {{has a population of}} 142,161 spread over an area of 19.55km². A floating population of 75,000 is attributed to service industries such as tourism. The largest demographic, 55%, is 16–45 years of age. A further 28% of the population are younger than 15 years.

25|$|People {{who suffer}} from dysgeusia are also forced to manage the impact that the {{disorder}} has on their quality of life. An altered taste has effects on food choice and intake {{and can lead to}} weight loss, malnutrition, impaired immunity, and a decline in health. Patients diagnosed with dysgeusia must use caution when adding sugar and salt to food and must be sure not to overcompensate for their lack of taste with excess amounts. Since the elderly are often on multiple medications, they are at risk for taste disturbances increasing the chances of developing depression, loss of appetite, and extreme weight loss. This <b>is</b> <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> an evaluation and management of their dysgeusia. In patients undergoing chemotherapy, taste distortions can often be severe and make compliance with cancer treatment difficult. Other problems that may arise include anorexia and behavioral changes that can be misinterpreted as psychiatric delusions regarding food. Symptoms including paranoia, amnesia, cerebellar malfunction, and lethargy can also manifest when undergoing histidine treatment. This makes it critical that these patients' dysgeusia is either treated or managed in order to improve their quality of life.|$|E

In particular, Amarna Letters 27 through 29 confirm that Tadukhipa became one of Akhenaten’s wives. Thus some Egyptologists have proposed that Tadukhipa and Kiya might be the same person.|$|E
