40|$|PURPOSE. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} ways to improve qualitative and quantitative assessments of retinal vessels and neovascularization (NV). METHODS. At postnatal day (P) 17, mice with oxygen-induced ischemic retinopathy were injected intravitreously with one of a variety of FITC-labeled or unlabeled antibodies and humanely killed 12 hours later. Retinas were <b>flat</b> <b>mounted</b> (retinas from eyes injected with labeled antibodies) or incubated with secondary antibody and then <b>flat</b> <b>mounted</b> (retinas from eyes injected with unlabeled antibodies). RESULTS. Retinas from eyes injected with labeled anti-platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM 1) showed good resolution of the fine structure of retinal NV, including filopodia at the tips of sprouts. New vessels originated from superficial retinal vessels, something that is widely recognized, bu...|$|R

2500|$|An early American {{electrical}} plug and receptacle {{was invented by}} Harvey Hubbell and patented in 1904.

Other manufacturers adopted the Hubbell pattern, and by 1915 they were widespread. [...] In 1913, Hubbell patented a parallel blade plug (...) [...] In 1916, Hubbell received a further patent for a polarized version of the parallel blade plug where one blade was both longer and wider than the other (...) [...] In the modern polarized version of NEMA 1-15, both blades are the same length, and only the width varies.|$|R

40|$|The {{zebrafish}} embryo is now {{commonly used}} for basic and biomedical research {{to investigate the}} genetic control of developmental processes and to model congenital abnormalities. During {{the first day of}} life, the zebrafish embryo progresses through many developmental stages including fertilization, cleavage, gastrulation, segmentation, and the organogenesis of structures such as the kidney, heart, and central nervous system. The anatomy of a young zebrafish embryo presents several challenges for the visualization and analysis of the tissues involved in many of these events because the embryo develops in association with a round yolk mass. Thus, for accurate analysis and imaging of experimental phenotypes in fixed embryonic specimens between the tailbud and 20 somite stage (10 and 19 hours post fertilization (hpf), respectively), such as those stained using whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH), it is often desirable to remove the embryo from the yolk ball and to position it flat on a glass slide. However, performing a <b>flat</b> <b>mount</b> procedure can be tedious. Therefore, successful and efficient <b>flat</b> <b>mount</b> preparation is greatly facilitated through the visual demonstration of the dissection technique, and also helped by using reagents that assist in optimal tissu...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is {{the leading}} cause of {{blindness}} in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This study evaluated the inhibitory effect of vasostatin (VS), an endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor, on CNV. Methods: Anti-angiogenic activity of VS was evaluated in vitro by migration and tube formation assays in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). CNV lesions were induced in Brown Norway rats by fundus argon laser photocoagulation. Beginning one day after CNV induction, rats were treated with eye drops containing 1 μg/ml VS in PBS buffer for three times daily for 20 days. The extent of CNV was examined by <b>flat</b> <b>mount</b> analysis on day 24 or by fundus fluorescein angiography (FAG) on days 21, 28, 35, and 42, respectively. CNV lesions and choroidal vascularity were evaluated by histological analysis. The spatial distribution of topically applied VS in rat eyes was evaluated by immunoblot analysis. Results: VS inhibited migration and tube formation in HUVECs. <b>Flat</b> <b>mount</b> analysis revealed that, after laser-induced photocoagulation, topical VS application for 20 days significantly reduced CNV lesions. Moreover, serial FAG analysis indicated that a 20 day VS treatment significantly reduced CNV lesions on all subsequent days. Histological analysis revealed attenuated lesions, intact Bruch’s membrane, and reduced choroidal vascularity in VS-treated eyes. Finall...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{demonstrate}} that interference microscopy of <b>flat</b> <b>mounted</b> internal limiting membrane specimens clearly delineates cellular proliferations at the vitreomacular interface. Methods: ILM specimens harvested during vitrectomy were fixed in glutaraldehyde 0. 05 % and paraformaldehyde 2 % for 24 h (pH 7. 4). In addition to interference microscopy, immunocytochemistry using antibodies against glial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament (NF) was performed. After washing in phosphatebuffered saline 0. 1 M, the specimens were flat-mounted on glass slides without sectioning, embedding {{or any other}} technique of conventional light microscopy. A cover slide and 49, 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole (DAPI) medium were added to stain the cell nuclei. Results: Interference microscopy clearly delineates cellular proliferations at the ILM. DAPI stained the cell nuclei. Areas of cellular proliferation can be easily distinguished from ILM areas without cells. Immunocytochemistry can be performed without changing the protocols used in conventional microscopy. Conclusion: Interference microscopy of <b>flat</b> <b>mounted</b> ILM specimens gives {{new insights into the}} distribution of cellular proliferations at the vitreomacular interface and allows for determination of the cell density at the ILM. Given that the entire ILM peeled is seen en face, the techniques described offer a more reliable method to investigate the vitreoretinal interface in terms of cellular distribution compared with conventional microscopy. ...|$|R
