40|$|International audience—Microbial {{fuel cells}} (MFCs) are sources {{harvesting}} energy from organic matters and showing great promise in powering environmental sensors. Because {{of the low}} power and voltage issues (100 µW at 0. 3 V for 20 cm² electrodes), an electrical interface is required to extract the maximum power delivered by the MFC and boost the output voltage. However the switching operation of most converters induces a pulsed sinking current which may cause additional <b>dynamic</b> <b>losses</b> inside the MFC. Following a previous study on a flyback converter in discontinuous conduction mode, this paper analyzes the effect of switching of the converter on the MFC internal <b>losses.</b> A <b>dynamic</b> model of the MFC is deduced from an impedance spectroscopy characterization: it reveals a double RC behavior, one with a time constant of 10 s of s, the other one of 100 s of µs. Then in the frequency-domain, the MFC <b>dynamic</b> <b>losses,</b> induced by a previously optimized flyback, are calculated: they represent 50 % of the maximum power that can be extracted from the MFC. Eventually {{in order to reduce}} these losses, we study the impact of three flyback parameters (primary inductance, duty cycle and decoupling capacitance). Adding a capacitance of 10 µF at the converter input, the MFC <b>dynamic</b> <b>losses</b> become negligible...|$|R

It is found that the dislocation internal friction in copper {{is determined by the}} superposition of two energy loss contributions : <b>dynamic</b> <b>loss</b> caused by the viscous dislocation drag and the relaxation one caused by thermoactivated dislocation motion. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>loss</b> contribution was singled out, and the temperature dependence of the damping constant B is obtained.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{addresses}} {{the development of}} a magneto-elastic coupling <b>dynamic</b> <b>loss</b> hysteresis model for giant magnetostrictive materials (GMMs). Considering the eddy current loss and anomalous loss, a dynamic constitutive model is proposed to predict the dynamic hysteresis behavior of GMMs. The model is validated by comparing the predicted results with experiments. At first, the frequency effect and anisotropy effect on the domain distribution can be obtained. Moreover, the magnetostriction cannot return to the initial value near the coercive field as the magnetization does with the increasing frequency. It can be explained that the domain distribution changes with the increasing energy loss. The model is benefit for the design and control of GMMs actuators...|$|E
