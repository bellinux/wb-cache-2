In n level region incrementing visual cryptography scheme, image is divided in n regions.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the "knowledge base" and the "globalization" of communication systems is discussed {{from the perspective of}} communication theory. I argue that inter-human communication takes place at two levels. At the <b>first</b> <b>level</b> <b>information</b> is exchanged and provided with meaning and at the second level meaning can reflexively be communicated. Human language can be considered as the evolutionary achievement which enables us to use these two channels of communication simultaneously. Providing meaning from the perspective of hindsight is a recursive operation: a meaning that makes a difference can be considered as knowledge. If the production of knowledge is socially organized, the perspective of hindsight can further be codified. This adds globalization to the historically stabilized patterns of communications. Globalization can be expected to transform the communications in an evolutionary mode. However, the self-organization of a knowledge-based society remains an expectation with the status of a hypothesis...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the research and}} development of the Dutch national standard for <b>information</b> <b>levels</b> of BIM. The US-developed "Levels of Development" (LOD) have become increasingly popular in the Netherlands. However, more and more projects felt the need to develop an additional LOD 250 and LDO 350. It became clear that the Dutch design-and-engineering process needed different <b>information</b> <b>levels</b> to operate effectively. During an R&D project that involved 9 Dutch SME companies research was done focused on the levels needed in the Dutch AEC industry. During this project, the team also looked at several other <b>information</b> <b>levels</b> - the Danish, the Australian, and the UK RIBA information and the LOD concept in CityGML. The project team came up with 7 <b>information</b> <b>levels.</b> A matrix was developed on which construction objects were linked to the 7 levels. Several companies in different BIM projects tested this matrix in practice. Results from this test were concluded in a guideline for effective use of the <b>information</b> <b>levels</b> and the matrix. This paper will describe the test results and the resulting recommendations for practical use of the standard in the Netherlands. Furthermore, an experiment was conducted to automatically identify the detail of the geometry of an IFC model. This was done by analyzing several characteristics like number of objects per m, and number of geometrical triangles per object. The results of this geometrical test are also added in the paper. © ASCE 2014...|$|R

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the importance of}} the <b>first</b> <b>information</b> report. The relevant provision is found in section 107 CPC of Part 5 Chapter 12 of Criminal Procedure Code. This is the basis upon which an investigation under this chapter commences. The object of the <b>first</b> <b>information</b> report is to make a complaint to the police so as to set the criminal law in motion. The value of such <b>first</b> <b>information</b> report is that it is the first report of an occurrence to the police and as such is entitled to the most careful consideration by the courts of law. Its importance {{lies in the fact that}} it is presumed to be untutored, unplanned and unthought out version of the incident just as it reaches the police. It is therefore obvious that the object of the <b>first</b> <b>information</b> report is to enable the courts to have the information about a crime given before it could be developed or embellished in any manner. It follows that any statement recorded after the commencement of the investigation and after there has been some development, has little or no value at all as <b>first</b> <b>information</b> because it can be made to fit into the case as developed. Another category is non <b>first</b> <b>information</b> reports. At the moment all these appear to be lumped into section 107 Criminal Procedure Code and these non FIR remains. Must there be a formal police report lodged before criminal investigation <b>first</b> <b>information</b> report commences? Whether the police could on their own initiative base on information received from their own sources start the investigation? This article surveys this aspect too.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate how information on the disability of a new-born child is passed on from health-care personnel to parents. The process consisting of parents receiving information on the disability of a child is called <b>first</b> <b>information.</b> In the present, <b>first</b> <b>information</b> is the subject of interest in the period when the precise disability of the child is not yet known. This intermediate stage is called liminal (see Turner 1967). The research assignment consisted of the following questions: 1) What were the narratives of the parents regarding the passing of <b>first</b> <b>information</b> upon the birth of a disabled child? 2) What were the experiences of workers regarding these <b>first</b> <b>information</b> situations" 3) What were the experiences of parents and workers of these liminal situations'? The purpose of the study was to increase understanding of the experiences of parents in view of the passing on <b>first</b> <b>information</b> and of the views of workers regarding their own work in passing on information. This is a narrative study, the material of which consists of interviews treated as narratives. Through them, information is obtained on the subjective experiences of actors. The research material consists of interviews of 16 families and 77 workers. The narratives, totalling 30, of four families and their close workers are taken into closer narrative interpretative analysis. The four families were chosen for closer analysis. because they were interviewed during the liminal stage. <b>First</b> <b>information</b> is primarily analysed from the perspective of parents. The picture of the passing of <b>first</b> <b>information</b> that is obtained from the narratives of parents is complemented with the perspective of the workers. Emerging from the narratives of the parents is experiential <b>first,</b> <b>information</b> consisting of the passing on of information, crisis experiences and the processes interaction. Experiential <b>first</b> <b>information</b> is divided into delayed, intermittent and fluent information, which are represented in the study by the doubting, emotional and information narratives. The encounters of parents and workers during the <b>first</b> <b>information</b> process are analysed more closely by applying frameworks of analysis developing on the basis of Erving Goffnian's (1986) frameworks of analysis. The encounter episodes are analysed via material-based framework of doubt, emotion and information. The results show that there are not always encounters, in which case by-passing takes place. When encounter takes places at the factual level it is termed collaboration. Successful encounters are called dialogical interaction. <b>First</b> <b>information</b> situations are different, and there is no correct manner of passing on information. The birth of a disabled child produces a crisis for parent. which means that information is best passed on in the information formation process in the dialogical interactions situation, in which emotions are also taken into account. In addition to <b>information,</b> <b>first</b> <b>information</b> situations also call for a humane aspect, which implies care not only for the child but also for the parents. The person providing the information should have the necessary sensitivity to see the parents' needs for support and the ability to respond to them. In <b>first</b> <b>information</b> situations, all information, care and caring provided by workers should he part of the support of parents, permitting them to preserve or create a belief in the sufficiency of their own resources and hope for managing with their child.
