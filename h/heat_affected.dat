5|$|The men {{arrived in}} Singapore on 18 February 1941 {{and moved into}} barracks at Port Dickson, {{in the north of}} Malaya. While there, the {{battalion}} undertook further training to prepare it for jungle warfare, before moving to Seremban in March. Further drafts of reinforcements arrived during this time as the battalion was brought up to its wartime establishment. The rigours of jungle training and the tropical <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> the men, and a number of personnel were hospitalised during this time with illnesses such as malaria, measles, mumps and serious tropical skin diseases. Some of these were repatriated back to Australia, {{and by the end of}} March, the 2/18th was still below its authorised establishment, with an actual strength of 898.|$|E
5|$|Argon is also {{commonly}} {{mixed with}} other gases, oxygen, helium, hydrogen and nitrogen. The addition {{of up to}} 5% oxygen (like the higher concentrations of carbon dioxide mentioned above) {{can be helpful in}} welding stainless steel, however, in most applications carbon dioxide is preferred. Increased oxygen makes the shielding gas oxidize the electrode, which can lead to porosity in the deposit if the electrode does not contain sufficient deoxidizers. Excessive oxygen, especially when used in application for which it is not prescribed, can lead to brittleness in the <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> zone. Argon-helium mixtures are extremely inert, and can be used on nonferrous materials. A helium concentration of 50–75% raises the required voltage and increases the heat in the arc, due to helium's higher ionization temperature. Hydrogen is sometimes added to argon in small concentrations (up to about 5%) for welding nickel and thick stainless steel workpieces. In higher concentrations (up to 25% hydrogen), it may be used for welding conductive materials such as copper. However, it should not be used on steel, aluminum or magnesium because it can cause porosity and hydrogen embrittlement.|$|E

50|$|Similarly, the {{appropriate}} value of heat capacity {{to use in}} a given process depends on whether the process produces a change in volume. The heat capacity {{is a function of}} the amount of heat added to a system. In the case of a constant-volume process, all the <b>heat</b> <b>affects</b> the internal energy of the system (i.e., there is no pV-work, and all the <b>heat</b> <b>affects</b> the temperature). However, in a process without a constant volume, the <b>heat</b> addition <b>affects</b> both the internal energy and the work (i.e., the enthalpy); thus the temperature changes by a different amount than in the constant-volume case and a different heat capacity value is required.|$|R
2500|$|Stainless steel {{can pose}} special {{corrosion}} challenges, since its passivating behavior {{relies on the}} presence of a major alloying component (chromium, at least 11.5%). Because of the elevated temperatures of welding and heat treatment, chromium carbides can form in the grain boundaries of stainless alloys. This chemical reaction robs the material of chromium in the zone near the grain boundary, making those areas much less resistant to corrosion. This creates a galvanic couple with the well-protected alloy nearby, which leads to [...] "weld decay" [...] (corrosion of the grain boundaries in the <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> zones) in highly corrosive environments. This process can seriously reduce the mechanical strength of welded joints over time.|$|E

60|$|Like all desert men, used to silence, Denton {{talked with}} difficulty, but {{the content of}} his speech made up for its brevity. He told us about the wanderers and prospectors he had rescued from death by {{starvation}} and thirst; he told us about the terrific noonday heat of summer; and about the incredible and horrible midnight furnace gales that swept down the valley. With the mercury at one hundred and twenty-five degrees at midnight, {{below the level of}} the sea, when these furnace blasts bore down upon him, it was just all he could do to live. No man could spend many summers there. As for white women--Death Valley was fatal to them. The Indians spent the summers up on the mountains. Denton said <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> men differently. Those who were meat eaters or alcohol drinkers, could not survive. Perfect heart and lungs were necessary to stand the heat and density of atmosphere below sea level. He told {{of a man who had}} visited his cabin, and had left early in the day, vigorous and strong. A few hours later he was found near the oasis unable to walk, crawling on his hands and knees, dragging a full canteen of water. He never knew what ailed him. It might have been heat, for the thermometer registered one hundred and thirty-five, and it might have been poison gas. Another man, young, of heavy and powerful build, lost seventy pounds weight in less than two days, and was nearly dead when found. The heat of Death Valley quickly dried up blood, tissue, bone. Denton told of a prospector who started out at dawn strong and rational, to return at sunset so crazy that he had to be tied to keep him out of the water. To have drunk his fill then would have killed him! He had to be fed water by spoonful. Another wanderer came staggering into the oasis, blind, with horrible face, and black swollen tongue protruding. He could not make a sound. He also had to be roped, as if he were a mad steer.|$|E

40|$|In {{the paper}} are {{presented}} {{the results of}} strength analysis for {{the two types of}} the welded joints made according to conventional and laser technologies of high-strength steel S 960 QC. The hardness distributions, tensile properties and fracture toughness were determined for the weld material and <b>heat</b> <b>affect</b> zone material for both types of the welded joints. Tests results shown on advantage the laser welded joints in comparison to the convention ones. Tensile properties and fracture toughness in all areas of the laser joints have a higher level than in the conventional one. The <b>heat</b> <b>affect</b> zone of the conventional welded joints is a weakness area, where the tensile properties are lower in comparison to the base material. Verification of the tensile tests, which carried out by using the Aramis video system, confirmed this assumption. The highest level of strains was observed in HAZ material and the destruction process occurred also in HAZ of the conventional welded joint...|$|R

50|$|Today {{other forms}} of metal cutting are {{becoming}} increasingly popular. An {{example of this is}} water jet cutting. Water jet cutting involves pressurized water in excess of 620 MPa (90 000 psi) and is able to cut metal and have a finished product. This process is called cold cutting, which eliminates the damage caused by a <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> zone, as opposed to laser and plasma cutting.|$|E
50|$|Friction stir {{processing}} (FSP) is {{a method}} of changing the properties of a metal through intense, localized plastic deformation. This deformation is produced by forcibly inserting a non-consumable tool into the workpiece, and revolving the tool in a stirring motion as it is pushed laterally through the workpiece. The precursor of this technique, friction stir welding, is used to join multiple pieces of metal without creating the <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> zone typical of fusion welding.|$|E

50|$|Flame {{hardening}} is used {{to harden}} {{only a portion of}} a metal. Unlike differential hardening, where the entire piece is heated and then cooled at different rates, in flame hardening, only a portion of the metal is heated before quenching. This is usually easier than differential hardening, but often produces an extremely brittle zone between the heated metal and the unheated metal, as cooling at the edge of this <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> zone is extremely rapid.|$|E
50|$|Welds and the <b>Heat</b> <b>Affected</b> Zone (HAZ) {{adjacent}} to welds can be brittle and fail without warning when subjected to sudden dynamic loading. The addition of nanoparticles such as magnesium and calcium makes the HAZ grains finer in plate steel. This nanoparticle addition {{leads to an}} increase in weld strength. The increase in strength results in a smaller resource requirement because less material is required in order to keep stresses within allowable limits.|$|E
50|$|Except in {{rare cases}} where maximum {{rigidity}} and hardness are needed, such as the untempered steel used for files, quenched steel is almost always tempered to some degree. However, steel is sometimes annealed through a process called normalizing, leaving the steel only partially softened. Tempering is sometimes used on normalized steels to further soften it, increasing the malleability and machinability for easier metalworking. Tempering may also be used on welded steel, to relieve some of the stresses and excess hardness created in the <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> zone around the weld.|$|E
