25|$|The first {{practical}} vapour-compression {{refrigeration system}} {{was built by}} James Harrison, a British journalist who had emigrated to Australia. His 1856 patent was for a vapour-compression system using ether, alcohol, or ammonia. He built a mechanical <b>ice-making</b> <b>machine</b> in 1851 {{on the banks of}} the Barwon River at Rocky Point in Geelong, Victoria, and his first commercial <b>ice-making</b> <b>machine</b> followed in 1854. Harrison also introduced commercial vapour-compression refrigeration to breweries and meat-packing houses, and by 1861, a dozen of his systems were in operation. He later entered the debate of how to compete against the American advantage of unrefrigerated beef sales to the United Kingdom. In 1873 he prepared the sailing ship Norfolk for an experimental beef shipment to the United Kingdom, which used a cold room system instead of a refrigeration system. The venture was a failure as the ice was consumed faster than expected.|$|E

He also designed the first <b>ice-making</b> <b>machines</b> in New South Wales, introduced the first lifts, patented an improved system of baling wool which increased capacity fourfold, and oversaw hydraulic and electric light installations {{in the city and}} the carriages on its railway network. He planned mills, waterworks and pumping stations, including the high-level pumps at the reservoir on Crown Street. He made major electric light installations at the Anthony Hordern & Sons department store and the Hotel Australia, and provided a hot-water system for the hotel. He designed machinery for factories, dairies and railways, including, in 1878, the incline of what is now the Scenic Railway attraction at Katoomba in the Blue Mountains– which claims to be the world's steepest. Its original purpose was the transportation of coal from the Jamison Valley to the cliff-top.|$|R

To counter this, a false map was issued by Melbourne interests to new arrivals, showing the quickest road to the goldfields as being via Melbourne. The first issue of the Geelong Advertiser newspaper was published in 1840 by James Harrison, who also built the world's first ether vapour compression cycle <b>ice-making</b> and refrigeration <b>machine</b> in 1844, later being commissioned by a brewery in 1856 to build a machine that cooled beer.|$|R

5000|$|In 1820, English {{scientist}} and inventor Michael Faraday discovered that compressing and liquefying ammonia could chill air when the liquefied ammonia {{was allowed to}} evaporate. In 1842, Florida physician John Gorrie used compressor technology to create ice, which he used to cool air for his patients in his hospital in Apalachicola, Florida. He hoped to eventually use his <b>ice-making</b> <b>machine</b> to regulate the temperature of buildings. He even envisioned centralized air conditioning that could cool entire cities. Though his prototype leaked and performed irregularly, Gorrie was granted a patent in 1851 for his <b>ice-making</b> <b>machine.</b> Though his process improved the artificial production of ice, his hopes for its success vanished soon afterwards when his chief financial backer died and Gorrie {{did not get the}} money he needed to develop the machine. According to his biographer, Vivian M. Sherlock, he blamed the [...] "Ice King", Frederic Tudor, for his failure, suspecting that Tudor had launched a smear campaign against his invention. Dr. Gorrie died impoverished in 1855, and the dream of commonplace air conditioning went away for 50 years.|$|E
50|$|The first cooling {{systems for}} food {{involved}} using ice. Artificial refrigeration {{began in the}} mid-1750s, and developed in the early 1800s.

In 1913, refrigerators for home use were invented. In 1923 Frigidaire introduced the first self-contained unit. The introduction of Freon in the 1920s expanded the refrigerator market during the 1930s. Home freezers as separate compartments (larger than necessary just for ice cubes) were introduced in 1940. Frozen foods, previously a luxury item, became commonplace.|$|E
50|$|Thaddeus S. C. Lowe, a local {{farm boy}} born in 1832, became a world-famous {{inventor}} of aerostats (dirigibles) and other devices.

50|$|At La Ceiba Allie buys a tiny {{settlement}} called Jeronimo from a drunk German. They then travel up {{the coast}} via motor launch to Santa Rosa by which time Allie, through force of personality, {{has taken over the}} launch from its captain, Mr. Haddy and steers it up the Aguán River to Jeronimo. On arrival Allie inspires the local Creoles and Zambus and over the coming weeks they help him transform the overgrown settlement into a thriving community. He builds a huge <b>ice-making</b> <b>machine</b> called 'Fat Boy' powered by hydrogen and ammonia, and transports the ice it produces farther up the river to isolated tribesmen, only to find to his disgust that missionaries have already reached them and 'corrupted' them to the ways of the West. He then mounts another expedition to take ice overland into Olancho, but the ice melts on the journey. They arrive at a small settlement and meet a group of Indians and three 'skinny men' who they take to be slaves. On return to Jeronimo they find the settlement nearly deserted. A missionary, who earlier Allie had driven away, had returned and persuaded most of the Creoles to leave with him. Soon afterwards, the three 'slaves' from Olancho arrive with guns and threaten Allie's domain. He tricks them and locks them in 'Fat Boy' intending to freeze them to death, but their gunfire causes an explosion which kills the three gunmen, destroys Jeronimo and pollutes the river.|$|E

40|$|The {{great need}} for cooling {{combined}} with Mexico's large availability of low enthalpy geothermal energy, {{makes it very}} attractive to utilize this resource for cooling using heat driven absorption systems. Mexico posseses large amounts of brine at temperatures which are too low to enable electricity to be generated efficiently and economically. Of the possible non electric uses of low and medium enthalpy geothermal energy are, to provide cold storage facilities for perishable foods and produce ice using the heat driven absorption cooling systems. The main purpose of the work described in the thesis is to obtain experimental data on heat driven absorption cooling systems using geothermal energy {{for the design of}} large scale systems. An experimental study on the performance of the ammonia-water absorption cooler operating on low enthalpy geothermal energy at the Cerro Prieto Geothermal Field was made. The system was used to cool a small storage unit at below freezing temperatures, during 8 hour tests and 24 hour tests. An experimental study on the performance of the ammonia-water absorption cooler operating on low enthalpy geothermal energy at the Cerro Prieto Geothermal Field, has been made in order to operate it as an <b>ice-making</b> <b>machine.</b> Some prototypes of ice generators were designed, installed and operated. An experimental study of a fluidized bed heat exchanger prototype connected to the ammonia-water absorption cooler was made in order to use the geothermal brine at the Cerro Prieto Geothermal Field.
