2500|$|Duffey's {{body was}} first placed upon a <b>kitchen</b> <b>chair,</b> then upon the bed {{on which he}} had been strangled. The body was {{repeatedly}} kissed, complimented and caressed by Nilsen, both before and after he had masturbated while sitting upon the stomach of the corpse. For two days, the body of Martyn Duffey was stowed in a cupboard, before Nilsen noted the youth's body had become bloated; therefore, [...] "he went straight under the floorboards".|$|E
60|$|There was no reply, {{and coming}} to the door, the four boys saw that the farmer's wife lay back in a <b>kitchen</b> <b>chair</b> in a dead faint.|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor Miss Celia wouldn't {{have had}} a roof over her head, if it hadn't been for you, Mr. Brown," [...] said Mrs. Moss, sinking into a <b>kitchen</b> <b>chair,</b> pale with the excitement.|$|E

60|$|Carl's {{own room}} {{contained}} only plaster walls, a narrow wooden bed, a bureau, a <b>kitchen</b> <b>chair.</b> Fifteen minutes in this irreproachable home sent Carl off to Eddie Klemm's billiard-parlor, {{which was not}} irreproachable.|$|E
6000|$|Sir Thomas {{on a hard}} <b>kitchen</b> <b>chair</b> {{began to}} talk. He said he had 'stood enough of being photographed like a wild beast,' and {{expressed}} loud regret {{that he had not}} killed 'that man,' who was 'conspiring with the sergeant to laugh at him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Letts {{cleared his}} throat and moved towards the door. [...] "You stick up for your rights, my girl," [...] he said, turning to Betty. [...] "If he don't treat your mother well, give him back his <b>kitchen</b> <b>chair</b> and his three stair-rods and pack him off." ...|$|E
60|$|There lay Eliza on two <b>kitchen</b> <b>chairs.</b> Her poor {{feet were}} all cut and bleeding, {{and she had}} fainted quite away. The master of the house drew his breath short, and stood silent.|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{the matter}} o' that, {{you could have}} all the <b>kitchen</b> <b>chairs</b> and all the stair-rods," [...] said Mr. Letts, generously. [...] "However, I don't want to do {{anything}} in a hurry, and I shouldn't dream of going to Australia without Betty. It rests with her." ...|$|R
50|$|The film {{inspired}} Fred to {{rent the}} former bakery {{next to his}} saloon, buy a piano and 99 <b>kitchen</b> <b>chairs</b> and launch the Cherokee Theatre in 1906. As silent movies flickered on the screen, Fred's nephew drummed in the background while his wife, Gertrude, played piano in the pit.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] the {{minister}} returned, with an assumption of cosiness {{in his tone}} {{which he did not}} feel, and feigning to make himself easy in the hard <b>kitchen</b> <b>chair</b> which he pulled up to the door of Hilbrook's room, [...] "let's see if we can't put that notion together again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{intend to}} shoot at him but I might succeed in {{frightening}} him away if he attempts to reach us here. Haven't {{you ever seen a}} trainer work with lions? He carries a silly little pop-gun loaded with blank cartridges. With that and a <b>kitchen</b> <b>chair</b> he subdues the most ferocious of beasts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen to that now!" [...] {{she would}} cry to another ancient retainer, Mary Ann, the housemaid, whose <b>kitchen</b> <b>chair</b> was tilted {{up against the}} side of the woodshed. [...] "It'll be Miss Honora next, and George Hanbury here to-day with his eye through a knothole in the fence, out of his head for a sight of ye." ...|$|E
50|$|At {{around this}} time, Elser joined a hiking club {{where he met}} Elsa Härlen. He moved to lodge in the Härlens' basement, {{building}} Elsa <b>kitchen</b> cabinets, <b>kitchen</b> <b>chairs</b> and a dolls' house. Their love affair {{in the spring of}} 1936 led to her separation from her husband in 1937 and divorce in 1938.|$|R
60|$|Two <b>kitchen</b> <b>chairs,</b> and a round table, and an {{attenuated}} old poker and tongs were, however, gathered {{round the}} fire-place, as was a saucepan over a feeble sputtering fire. There {{was a bit}} of cheese and bread, and a tin candlestick on the table, and a little black porter in a pint-pot.|$|R
50|$|Newlyweds Bill and Louise Foster {{move into}} the house of their dreams but it quickly becomes a nightmare. Goop oozes out of {{cabinets}} and coffee pots, little earthquakes keep happening, things go bump in the night, <b>kitchen</b> <b>chairs</b> keep running into Louise, and worst of all, the Foster's cross keeps inverting itself over and over on their wall.|$|R
60|$|David Thain dragged {{an old-fashioned}} <b>kitchen</b> <b>chair</b> from the porch, and sat by his uncle's side. Richard Vont, {{although}} he was still younger than his sixty-four years, seemed to his nephew curiously changed during the last week. The hard, resolute face was disturbed. The mouth, kept so tight through the years, had weakened a little. There was a vague, almost pathetic agitation, in the man's face.|$|E
60|$|The {{front part}} of the shipping-office on Atlantic Avenue was a glass-inclosed room {{littered}} with chairs, piles of circulars, old pictures of Cunarders, older calendars, and directories to be ranked as antiques. In the midst of these remains a red-headed Yankee of forty, smoking a Pittsburg stogie, sat tilted back in a <b>kitchen</b> <b>chair,</b> reading the Boston American. Mr. Wrenn delivered M. Baraieff's letter and stood waiting, holding his suit-case, ready to skip out and go aboard a cattle-boat immediately.|$|E
6000|$|... "Some of the {{passengers}} came on foot, with commissioners to bring their baggage. The commissioners carried their baggage on their backs. They had a frame something like an old-fashioned <b>kitchen</b> <b>chair</b> strapped to their shoulders, and the baggage was piled upon this very high. One commissioner that came had on his frame, first a big black trunk, placed endwise, and then a portmanteau, then a carpet bag, and on the top a bandbox. The bandbox reached far above his head. I should not think they could possibly carry such heavy loads.|$|E
50|$|<b>Kitchen</b> <b>Chairs</b> - Each of {{the contestants}} must {{assemble}} IKEA <b>chairs</b> for the <b>kitchens.</b> Everyone except Joe finishes {{in less than}} 40 minutes. Joe's frustrations with Rita lets him to eject Rita from his room, and enlists the help of Charmaine, who only serves to disassemble the front legs and put them backwards. He does not finish in time.|$|R
5000|$|On October 1, 1864, <b>Kitchen</b> <b>chaired</b> a Union {{meeting at}} Martinsburg, West Virginia.

60|$|The unaccustomed {{sight of}} her mother's grief was terrible. For an instant only she clung to Janet, then {{becoming}} mute, she {{sat down in the}} <b>kitchen</b> <b>chair</b> and stared with dry, unseeing eyes at the wall. Her face twitched. Janet could not bear to look at it, to see the torture in her mother's eyes. She, Janet, seemed suddenly to have grown old herself, to have lived through ages of misery and tragedy.... She was aware of a pungent odour, went to the stove, picked up the fork, and turned the steak. Now and then she glanced at Hannah. Grief seemed to have frozen her. Then, from the dining-room she heard footsteps, and Edward stood in the doorway.|$|E
60|$|Well, one day--now {{this really}} is romantic and I am rather proud of it. My {{chambers}} are on the second floor, and are backed by an anxiously polite street between which and mine are little yards called, I think, gardens. They are so small {{that if you have}} the tree your neighbour has the shade from it. I was looking out at my back window on the day we have come to when whom did I see but the whilom nursery governess sitting on a chair in one of these gardens. I put up my eye-glass to make sure, and undoubtedly it was she. But she sat there doing nothing, which was by no means my conception of the jade, so I brought a fieldglass to bear and discovered that the object was merely a lady's jacket. It hung {{on the back of a}} <b>kitchen</b> <b>chair,</b> seemed to be a furry thing, and, I must suppose, was suspended there for an airing.|$|E
6000|$|... [Summer {{afternoon}} in a cottage garden {{on the eastern}} slope of a hill a little south of Haslemere in Surrey. Looking up the hill, the cottage {{is seen in the}} left hand corner of the garden, with its thatched roof and porch, and a large latticed window {{to the left of the}} porch. A paling completely shuts in the garden, except for a gate on the right. The common rises uphill beyond the paling to the sky line. Some folded canvas garden chairs are leaning against the side bench in the porch. A lady's bicycle is propped against the wall, under the window. A little to the right of the porch a hammock is slung from two posts. A big canvas umbrella, stuck in the ground, keeps the sun off the hammock, in which a young lady is reading and making notes, her head towards the cottage and her feet towards the gate. In front of the hammock, and within reach of her hand, is a common <b>kitchen</b> <b>chair,</b> with a pile of serious-looking books and a supply of writing paper on it.] ...|$|E
2500|$|Chair pads are {{cushions}} for chairs. They contain cotton or foam for padding. Some are decorative. [...] In cars, {{they may}} be used to increase the height of the driver. Orthopedic backrests provide support for the back. [...] Some manufacturers have patents on their designs and are recognized by medical associations as beneficial. Car seats sometimes have built-in and adjustable lumbar supports. These can also be used on <b>kitchen</b> <b>chairs.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Clarkson {{bought a}} 1996 Mercedes-Benz S280 and {{designed}} his perfect interior based upon his imagined perfect house. The car, dubbed [...] "Anne Hathaway's Cottage", featured a wood-burning stove, <b>kitchen</b> <b>chairs,</b> a flagstone floor, and wood with a cement base (weighing approximately two tons), even plastering the door trim. James May and Richard Hammond then tested the car. A lack of seat belts and unsecured seats meant they tumbled around inside the car. Eventually, with May holding Hammond's seat, a 0-60 time of 35.4 seconds was established.|$|R
60|$|He {{was still}} too weak to paint, and {{he sat in the}} studio, silent, {{occupied}} with God knows what dreams, or reading. The books he liked were queer; sometimes I would find him poring over the poems of Mallarme, and he read them as a child reads, forming the words with his lips, and I wondered what strange emotion he got from those subtle cadences and obscure phrases; and again I found him absorbed in the detective novels of Gaboriau. I amused myself by thinking that in his choice of books he showed pleasantly the irreconcilable sides of his fantastic nature. It was singular to notice that even in the weak state of his body he had no thought for its comfort. Stroeve liked his ease, and in his studio were a couple of heavily upholstered arm-chairs and a large divan. Strickland would not go near them, not from any affectation of stoicism, for I found him seated on a three-legged stool when I went into the studio one day and he was alone, but because he did not like them. For choice he sat on a <b>kitchen</b> <b>chair</b> without arms. It often exasperated me to see him. I never knew a man so entirely indifferent to his surroundings.|$|E
60|$|After this {{conversation}} they went in, and found Aunt Roger very busy, recommending servants to Aunt Mary, and grandmamma enforcing all she said. The visit soon {{came to an}} end, and {{they went on to}} the Pleasance, where the inspection did not prove quite as agreeable as on the first occasion; for grandmamma and Beatrice had very different views respecting the appropriation of the rooms, and poor Mrs. Frederick Langford was harassed and wearied by her vain attempts to accede to the wishes of both, and vex neither. Grandmamma was determined too to look over every corner, and discuss every room, and Henrietta, in despair at the fatigue her mother was obliged to go through, kept on seeking in vain for a seat for her, and having at last discovered a broken-backed <b>kitchen</b> <b>chair</b> in some of the regions below, kept diligently carrying it after her in all her peregrinations. She was constantly wishing that Uncle Geoffrey would come, but in vain; and between the long talking at Sutton Leigh, the wandering about the house, and the many discussions, her mamma was completely tired out, and obliged, when they came home, to confess that she had a headache. Henrietta fairly wished her safe at Rocksand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Aha, Mrs. Gripper, {{there you}} are with your pots and pans, and your burning fiery furnace! One had need be Shadrach, Meshach, and the other fellow to stand over that. Breakfast as soon as ever you like. Eggs, sausages, bacon, kidneys, marmalade, water-cresses, coffee, and so forth. My friend and I belong to the select few whom it's a perfect {{privilege}} to cook for. Voluptuaries, Mrs. Gripper, voluptuaries, both of us. You'll see," [...] continued Allan, as they went on toward the stairs, [...] "I shall make that worthy creature young again; I'm better than a doctor for Mrs. Gripper. When she laughs, she shakes her fat sides, and when she shakes her fat sides, she exerts her muscular system; and when she exerts her muscular system--Ha! here's Susan again. Don't squeeze yourself flat against the banisters, my dear; if you don't mind hustling me on the stairs, I rather like hustling you. She looks like a full-blown rose when she blushes, doesn't she? Stop, Susan! I've orders to give. Be very particular with Mr. Midwinter's room: shake up his bed like mad, and dust his furniture till those nice round arms of yours ache again. Nonsense, my dear fellow! I'm not too familiar with them; I'm only keeping them up to their work. Now, then, Richard! where do we breakfast? Oh, here. Between ourselves, Midwinter, these splendid rooms of mine are a size too large for me; I don't feel as if I should ever be on intimate terms with my own furniture. My views in life are of the snug and slovenly sort--a <b>kitchen</b> <b>chair,</b> you know, and a low ceiling. Man wants but little here below, and wants that little long. That's not exactly the right quotation; but it expresses my meaning, and we'll let alone correcting it till the next opportunity." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{furniture}} {{consisted of}} a wash-hand stand and a little deal chest of drawers, which acted as sideboard to such pots and pans and crockery as could not find room in the grate; and besides the bed {{there was nothing but}} two <b>kitchen</b> <b>chairs</b> and a lamp. Liza looked at it all and felt perfectly satisfied; she put a pin into one corner of the noble Marquess to prevent him from falling, fiddled about with the ornaments a little, and then started washing herself. After putting on her clothes she ate some bread-and-butter, swallowed a dishful of cold tea, and went out into the street.|$|R
60|$|But Peter and Sogrange {{were both}} of them too wise to expend any more of their {{strength}} in a useless struggle. They suffered themselves to be conducted without resistance across the white stone hall, down a long passage, and into {{a room at the}} end, the window and fireplace of which were both blocked up. The floor was of red flags and the walls whitewashed. The only furniture was a couple of <b>kitchen</b> <b>chairs</b> and a long table. The door was of stout oak and fitted with a double lock. The sole outlet, so far as they could see, was a small round hole {{at the top of the}} roof. The door was locked behind them. They were alone.|$|R
6000|$|This {{ideal of}} {{uniqueness}} in all individuals {{is not only}} true of the classifications of material science; it is true and still more evidently true of the species of common thought; it is true of common terms. Take the word [...] "Chair." [...] When one says chair, one thinks vaguely of an average chair. But collect individual instances; think of armchairs and reading-chairs and dining-room <b>chairs,</b> and <b>kitchen</b> <b>chairs,</b> chairs that pass into benches, chairs that cross the boundary and become settees, dentist's chairs, thrones, opera stalls, seats of all sorts, those miraculous fungoid growths that cumber the floor of the Arts and Crafts exhibition, and you will perceive what a lax bundle in fact is this simple straightforward term. In co-operation with an intelligent joiner I would undertake to defeat any definition of chair or chairishness that you gave me. Chairs just as much as individual organisms, just as much as mineral and rock specimens, are unique things--if you know them well enough you will find an individual difference even in a set of machine-made chairs--and it is only because we do not possess minds of unlimited capacity, because our brain has {{only a limited number of}} pigeon-holes for our correspondence with an unlimited universe of objective uniques, that we have to delude ourselves into the belief that there is a chairishness in this species common to and distinctive of all chairs.|$|R
