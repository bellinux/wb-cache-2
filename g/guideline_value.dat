40|$|Risk {{assessment}} {{is made to}} determine risks with contaminated areas and to determine which treatment the area requires. In Sweden, risk {{assessment is}} divided into three levels: risk analysis, facilitated risk assessment and detailed risk assessment. In detailed risk assessment site-specific <b>guideline</b> <b>values</b> are developed to compare with values of contaminants that are measured in the area. Site-specific <b>guideline</b> <b>values</b> vary with geological and hydrogeological parameters. The purpose of this report is to examine which of these parameters that affect the <b>guideline</b> <b>values.</b> The examination was done using a calculating program for consideration from the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency from the year of 1997. The study shows that some of the geological and hydrogeological parameters affect the site-specific <b>guideline</b> <b>values</b> for metals in different ways and others do not.   Using the program from the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency is a simple way to calculate site-specific <b>guideline</b> <b>values.</b> It’s important to make sure that relevant values are chosen to get correct results. The calculating program is still not definitive so it’s important to be careful when using it. Another purpose of the report is to compare how <b>guideline</b> <b>values</b> have developed from the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency’s model for calculating <b>guideline</b> <b>values</b> from the year of 1997 with their new report whit the same purpose from the year of 2007. <b>Guideline</b> <b>values</b> for all metals that have been considered are lower in the new model from the year of 2007 compared to the model from the year of 1997...|$|R

50|$|Distillation removes all {{minerals}} from water, and {{the membrane}} methods of reverse osmosis and nanofiltration remove most, or virtually all, minerals. This results in demineralized water, {{which has not}} been proven to be healthier than drinking water. The World Health Organization investigated the health effects of demineralized water in 1980, and its experiments in humans found that demineralized water increased diuresis and the elimination of electrolytes, with decreased serum potassium concentration. Magnesium, calcium and other nutrients in water can help to protect against nutritional deficiency. Recommendations for magnesium have been put at a minimum of 10 mg/L with 20-30 mg/L optimum; for calcium a 20 mg/L minimum and a 40-80 mg/L optimum, and a total water hardness (adding magnesium and calcium) of 2-4 mmol/L. At water hardness above 5 mmol/L, higher incidences of gallstones, kidney stones, urinary stones, arthrosis, and arthropathies have been observed. For fluoride, the concentration recommended for dental health is 0.5-1.0 mg/L, with a maximum <b>guideline</b> <b>value</b> of 1.5 mg/L to avoid dental fluorosis.|$|E
40|$|Organization (WHO) <b>guideline</b> <b>value</b> for {{manganese}} {{in drinking}} water. DATA SOURCES AND EXTRACTION: The initial starting point was the background document {{for the development}} of the WHO’s <b>guideline</b> <b>value</b> for manganese in drinking water as well as other regulations and recommendations on manganese intake levels. Data referred to in these documents were traced back to the original research papers. In addition, we searched for scientific reports on manganese exposure and health effects. DATA SYNTHESIS: The current health-based <b>guideline</b> <b>value</b> for manganese in drinking water is based partly on debatable assumptions, where information from previous reports has been used without revisiting original scientific articles. Presently, preparation of common infant formulas with water containing manganese concentrations equivalent to the WHO <b>guideline</b> <b>value</b> will result in exceeding the maximum manganese concentration for infant formula. However, there are uncertainties about how this maximum value was derived. Concurrently, there is increasing evidence of negative neurologic effects in children from excessive manganese exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing number of studies reporting associations between neurologic symptoms and manganese exposure in infants and children, in combination with the questionable scientific background data used in setting the manganese <b>guideline</b> <b>value</b> for drinking water, certainly warrant a re-evaluation of the <b>guideline</b> <b>value.</b> Further research is needed to understand the causal relationship between manganese exposure and children’s health, and to enable an improved risk assessment...|$|E

All the NH 4 +-N concentration observed in the present study was lower than 70  µg l− 1 of un-ionized ammonia (≈ 0.054  mg l− 1 of un-ionized ammonia nitrogen). Nitrite nitrogen complied with the <b>guideline</b> <b>value</b> of 55  µg NO 2 l− 1 (≈ 0.017  mg l− 1) at most of the stations. However, near-bottom NO 2 −-N concentration in the Sibu Laut River exceeded the <b>guideline</b> <b>value</b> during low tide with NO 2 −-N concentration ranged from 0.077 to 0.587  mg l− 1. On the other hand, NO 2 −-N concentrations on three out of four water samples at station 5 were violated the <b>guideline</b> <b>value.</b> Nitrate nitrogen violated the <b>guideline</b> <b>value</b> of 60  µg NO 3 l− 1 (≈ 0.014  mg l− 1) at all stations throughout the study periods. Nitrate is thermodynamically the most stable form of InOrg-N in well-oxygenated waters. The reference level of 0.014  mg l− 1 for nitrate may be too low because nitrate is relatively non-toxic to aquatic organisms (Wickins 1976; Rubin and Elmaraghy 1977). No formal water quality criteria and standard exist for nitrate in estuarine waters. The Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (2003) has recommended nitrate concentration ranging 2.9 – 3.6  mg l− 1 to protect freshwater and marine life; whereas Camargo et al.

What is more, the nitrate concentration for USA federal maximum level for drinking water is 10  mg l− 1 (USEPA 2009).

40|$|In {{most parts}} of Europe NO 2 {{emissions}} from excessive road traffic, concentrated by confined spaces and limited dispersion, are often higher than the ambient guideline values. As a pollutant,NO 2 {{has a number of}} adverse effects on human health and the environment. The European Union sets guideline and threshold values for various pollutants, to protect humans and the environment, of which NO 2 is one. Flanders adopted these values as most countries did, and the monitoring and evaluation of the levels against these guideline values are mostly done by VMM (the Flemish Environmental Company). The air quality Framework Directive (96 / 62 /EG) was drafted on the 27 th of September 1996 and instituted on the 21 st of November 1996. New guideline values forNO 2 will come into effect in 2010 (1999 / 30 /EG). The future hourly <b>guideline</b> <b>value</b> is 200 µg m- 3 which may not be exceeded more than 18 times in a calendar year. The average annual <b>guideline</b> <b>value</b> must not exceed 40 µg m- 3. Currently various pollutants are continuously monitored by means of fixed monster monitors and analysers, where after data is extrapolated to give an overview of the dispersion. In the 2003 annual report the future <b>guideline</b> <b>value</b> has been exceeded in 7 locations in Flanders. Moreover, in a separate study it was reported that in various locations with high traffic density and low dispersion, this value was exceeded, even though the dispersion model did not indicate it. Hence, to test these and other locations against the future <b>guideline</b> <b>value</b> a total of 19 points, in 6 different cities and towns in Flanders, were chosen to monitor the NO 2 profile over a 1 year period. Passive sampling, averaged over periods of 2 weeks, was used and comparisons with the fixed monitors in some of these locations were possible. The future annual <b>guideline</b> <b>value</b> of 40 µg m- 3 (2010) was exceeded in 11 of the 19 measured locations. When high traffic density was accompanied by low dispersion the value was at its highest and the results confirmed the relationship between high traffic density and high NO 2 concentrations. A good correlation between duplicate measurements and those compared to the fixed monitors ensured accurate and precise results.
