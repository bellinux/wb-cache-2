40|$|In the {{automotive}} industry many parts are connected with different types of clips. One of them is studied in this Master Thesis. The studied clip is of metal and used to connect plastic parts {{to each other in}} the interior of the cars. The aim is to find the mechanical properties of this clip joint at room temperature and 80 C and to implement in a simple connector element representing the clip joint. The properties in the clip connection are determined by use of a combination of component tests and simulations. The tests are performed by fastening one part in the clip connection and applying a displacement at the other part and measuring the force to get a force vs displacement relation. In the finite element simulations are the same loading case used. In the numerical simulations is also a sensitivity analysis performed to investigate what parameters affects the properties of the clip joint the most. The study gives linear stiffnesses perpendicular to the hole and around all axes. The frictional force when sliding along the hole occurs is determined. The forces needed to assemble and dis-assemble the clip joint are also determined. All these properties are determined both for room temperature and for 80 C. The determined properties are only valid until a specific displacement when the plastic parts come in contact. From the sensitivity study is concluded that the most important parameters are the hole size and thickness of the clip. The determined properties make it possible to include a more realistic behavior of the clip joint in simulations with clips. It is possible because the representation in the connector element still is simple but more realistic and prevents the number of degrees of freedom to increase drastically.

40|$|Power-line {{communication}} (PLC) {{has been}} recognized as a promising alternative communication technology due to the universal existence of power lines. However, signal transmitted through PLC channel suffers from severe inter-symbol interference (ISI) and strong impulsive noise (IN), degrading the reliability of data transmission. Although multicarrier orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) has been investigated to combat ISI in PLC, the inherent large peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of OFDM signal makes IN detection very difficult, and the OFDM based PLC system {{may not be the}} best choice under hostile PLC channels. To combat both ISI and IN, we propose a low complexity scheme based on single-carrier frequency-domain turbo equalization (SC-FDTE) coupled with iterative IN mitigation. Simulation results indicate that, the proposed scheme is able to efficiently mitigate IN in the PLC channel and outperforms the <b>joint</b> <b>clipping</b> and blanking approach for IN mitigation...|$|R
40|$|Multicarrier system such as {{orthogonal}} {{frequency division}} multiplexing (OFDM) are significantly affected by peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR). Many researchers introduce different techniques to reduce PAPR with tradeoffs of data rate loss and computations of approach. In some cases, {{the techniques of}} reduction may lead to increase average power of transmitted signal and degrades the BER performance at the receiver. Hence, proper design of PAPR reduction technique needs to be considered. In this paper, a combination of Clipping Peak and Amplifying Bottom (CPAB) is proposed. The peak of signal is clipped at a threshold A, while the bottom values of signal are amplified to threshold B. The clipping technique was widely accepted method to improve the PAPR statistics. Therefore, <b>joint</b> <b>clipping</b> with amplifying in CPAB will develop PAPR reduction. In addition, PAPR value depends on clipping and amplifying thresholds. The result shows that the clipping factor affected the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) performance more than the amplifying factor in CPAB technique. Thus, by properly select the threshold of A and B, better OFDM system performance is achieved with lower PAPR...|$|R

50|$|Plastic <b>joint</b> <b>clips</b> {{are usually}} made of polyacetal, and are colored {{according}} to joint sizes.

Typical problem areas include a flask over the plate (which may drop off the end of the column as it gets hot) and the connection the condenser makes to the still head (which will reach high temperatures and may allow the condenser to fall off). As such, different clips should be used at these points or the glassware should be clamped such that these elements can't slide apart or don't need the clip. Polyacetal clips suffer another problem in that the material is strongly affected by the corrosive gases. This effect can be so dramatic that the clip will fall apart in minutes of exposure to minute quantities leaking through even greased, ground tapers. Importantly, this failure mode is sudden and without warning.|$|R
