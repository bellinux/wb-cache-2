5|$|Some {{commentators}} see {{the conservative}} readings of Forrest Gump as indicants {{of the death}} of irony <b>in</b> <b>American</b> <b>culture.</b> Vivian Sobchack notes that the film's humor and irony relies on the assumption of the audience's historical (self-) consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Defining {{themselves}} as both Swedish and American, the Swedish-American community retained a fascination {{for the old}} country {{and their relationship to}} it. The nostalgic visits to Sweden which had begun in the 1870s continued well into the 20th century, and narratives from these trips formed a staple of the lively Swedish-American publishing companies. The accounts testify to complex feelings, but each contingent of American travellers were freshly indignant at Swedish class pride and Swedish disrespect for women. It was with renewed pride <b>in</b> <b>American</b> <b>culture</b> that they returned to the Midwest.|$|E
5|$|Jack was {{not always}} {{the name of the}} Georgetown Hoyas' mascot, nor was the mascot always a bulldog, as other types of dogs, {{particularly}} bull terriers, were associated with the sports teams before 1962. In 2009, the American Kennel Club ranked Jack as the 8th most popular dog <b>in</b> <b>American</b> <b>culture.</b> Today, Georgetown is among thirty-nine American universities to use a bulldog as their mascot, with Georgia, Butler, Mississippi State, Yale and James Madison being the only others with a live bulldog. Jack is also portrayed by a costumed character Bulldog mascot, a tradition dating to 1977.|$|E

5|$|Shoup {{opposed the}} {{military}} escalation {{in response to}} {{events such as the}} Cuban Missile Crisis and the Bay of Pigs invasion, but his strongest opposition was to U.S. involvement in South Vietnam. His opposition grew in strength after he retired from the military in 1963; he was hostile to both the strategy of the conflict and the excessive influence of corporations and military officials upon foreign policy. His high-profile criticism later spread to include the military industrial complex and what he saw as a pervasive militarism <b>in</b> <b>American</b> <b>culture.</b> Historians consider Shoup's statements opposing the war to be among the most pointed and high-profile leveled by a veteran against the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|The {{show has}} {{undergone}} significant changes throughout its history. The format of Sesame Street {{consists of a}} combination of commercial television production elements and techniques which have evolved to reflect the changes <b>in</b> <b>American</b> <b>culture</b> and the audience's viewing habits. With the creation of Sesame Street, producers and writers of a children's television show used, for the first time, educational goals and a curriculum to shape its content. It was also the first time a show's educational effects were formally studied.|$|E
5|$|Bartholdi and Laboulaye {{considered}} {{how best}} to express the idea of American liberty. In early American history, two female figures were frequently used as cultural symbols of the nation. One of these symbols, the personified Columbia, {{was seen as an}} embodiment of the United States in the manner that Britannia was identified with the United Kingdom and Marianne came to represent France. Columbia had supplanted the earlier figure of an Indian princess, which had come to be regarded as uncivilized and derogatory toward Americans. The other significant female icon <b>in</b> <b>American</b> <b>culture</b> was a representation of Liberty, derived from Libertas, the goddess of freedom widely worshipped in ancient Rome, especially among emancipated slaves. A Liberty figure adorned most American coins of the time, and representations of Liberty appeared in popular and civic art, including Thomas Crawford's Statue of Freedom (1863) atop the dome of the United States Capitol Building.|$|E

25|$|Lever-action guns {{represent}} the earliest successful repeating actions.

25|$|Some {{aspects of}} American culture codify racism.

25|$|Bigfoot {{has become}} better known and a {{phenomenon}} in popular culture, and sightings have spread throughout North America.

25|$|Other {{examples}} of this influence are the Gold Pyramid House in Illinois or the famous Obelisk (Washington Monument) in Washington, D.C. Movies such as The Mummy (1999) (itself a remake of a 1932 Boris Karloff film) and its sequels demonstrate that ancient Egypt and the discovery of its secrets is still a powerful point of reference for contemporary western cultures.
