5|$|The Hurricane Severity Index (HSI) {{is another}} scale used and rates the {{severity}} {{of all types of}} tropical and subtropical cyclones based on both the <b>intensity</b> <b>and</b> the size of their wind fields.

This research was aimed {{to find out}} the effects of light <b>intensities</b> <b>and</b> planting material types of cuttings affecting the growth of Luja plants. The light intensity treatments consisted of 100 %, 65 %, 35 %, 15 % and the planting material types covered both basal and tip cuttings. The design used was Split Plot Design and continued with Duncan's Test. The results showed that there was no interaction between light <b>intensities</b> <b>and</b> cuttings, but the effect of light <b>intensities</b> <b>and</b> cuttings was singularly found in the SLA, RGR, LAD, LAR, and NAR variables. Moreover, Luja plants could grow well at the light intensity of 15 % - 65 % with the optimum light intensity of 35 %. Both basal and tip cuttings could be used as the planting materials. However, the material type of cuttings that could accelerate the vegetative phase-growth of Luja plants the most was tip cuttings.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} west coast of Africa and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean on September11. After tracking westward for five days, the wave entered the Caribbean Sea on September16. Convection steadily increased in both coverage and <b>intensity,</b> <b>and</b> by September19, the system reached the southwestern Caribbean Sea. Satellite imagery and surface observations indicated that Tropical Depression Nine formed at 1800UTC on September19, while located 50miles (80km) north-northwest of San Andres Island.|$|E

It {{turned to the}} northeast and east through South Carolina, following behind Hurricane Lili to its northeast. For a time, the system's proximity to Lili resulted in hints of the Fujiwhara effect, in which two tropical cyclone appear to rotate around each other. The cold front that absorbed the weakening low was to the storm's north on October 13, though moisture from the remnants of Marco dropped heavy rainfall across the southeast United States for another day.|$|E

5|$|As the {{hurricane}} neared the Florida Keys on September25, its eye reformed and became more pronounced on satellite imagery. The reorganization {{led to an}} increase in <b>intensity,</b> <b>and</b> at about 1530UTC, Georges made landfall near Key West with winds of 105mph (160km/h). The hurricane's forward motion shifted to west-northwest, and forecast models indicated that Georges would re-attain Category 3 status before making landfall along the northern Gulf Coast. The slow motion of the storm led to an erratic track, mainly caused by westward wobbles of the eye. Vertical wind shear was estimated at up to 35mph (55km/h), restricting outflow within {{the hurricane}} and confining the most intense convection to {{the eastern side of the}} circulation.|$|E
5|$|As {{the storm}} {{approached}} Puerto Rico late on September21, the wind shear began to relent, allowing Georges to re-organize; however, its outflow {{was unable to}} fully redevelop due to its proximity to land. Around 2200UTC, the storm reattained Category 3 <b>intensity</b> <b>and</b> made landfall in Puerto Rico with winds of 115mph (185km/h) before weakening again. Hours later, the storm entered the Mona Passage and began to once again reorganize. As Georges approached the Dominican Republic, it unexpectedly developed a well-defined eye and began to intensify, attaining winds of 120mph (195km/h); satellite imagery suggested that Georges re-attained Category 4 intensity. It made landfall on the Dominican Republic at 1230UTC on September22 as a Category 3 hurricane.|$|E
