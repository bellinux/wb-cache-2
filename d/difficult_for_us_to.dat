Along with non-intelligent life, such civilizations would be also very <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> detect.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} criticism of empirical views of mathematics is {{approximately the same}} as that raised against Mill. If mathematics is just as empirical as the other sciences, then this suggests that its results are just as fallible as theirs, and just as contingent. In Mill's case the empirical justification comes directly, while in Quine's case it comes indirectly, through the coherence of our scientific theory as a whole, i.e. consilience after E.O. Wilson. Quine suggests that mathematics seems completely certain because the role it plays in our web of belief is incredibly central, {{and that it would be}} extremely <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> revise it, though not impossible.|$|E
500|$|The studio {{version of}} the song was {{compiled}} from several different takes. It {{was one of several}} songs mixed by Steve Lillywhite in the final months of recording The Joshua Tree. Drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. later said of the song, [...] "It took so long to get that song right, it was <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> make any sense of it. It only became a truly great song through playing live. On the record, musically, it's not half the song it is live." ...|$|E

While they acknowledged that individual anchors might have idiosyncratic effects, “It is <b>difficult,</b> however, <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> believe that the chosen anchors plausibly could have serious, systematic effects” (Peterson et al. 1999, p.  244).|$|R
500|$|Poe {{describes}} his method in writing [...] "The Raven" [...] {{in the essay}} [...] "The Philosophy of Composition", and {{he claims to have}} strictly followed this method. It has been questioned whether he really followed this system, however. T. S. Eliot said: [...] "It is <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> read that essay without reflecting that if Poe plotted out his poem with such calculation, he might have taken a little more pains over it: the result hardly does credit to the method." [...] Biographer Joseph Wood Krutch described the essay as [...] "a rather highly ingenious exercise in the art of rationalization".|$|E
500|$|Shortly after Xenogears was released, {{there was}} {{speculation}} of a sequel being released, although this never occurred. In 1999, Tanaka {{said that a}} project related to Xenogears was being developed. He also revealed that a sequel to Xenogears was initially planned, but never came to be. While Xenogears has never had an official sequel or prequel, there was wide speculation that Namco and Monolith Soft's Xenosaga was a prequel {{when it was first}} announced. Tetsuya Takahashi was the director and writer for both Xenogears and Xenosaga and has noted that [...] "with our relation between Square, I think it is <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> say it is a direct sequel or prequel". Approximately twenty members of the Xenosaga development staff had previously worked on Xenogears.|$|E
500|$|In July 2013, D’Esposito {{said he had}} {{considered}} making stand-alone shorts for several characters, including Loki, a young Nick Fury, Black Panther, Ms. Marvel, and Black Widow. Regarding Loki, D’Esposito said [...] "Being on Asgard is very <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> do in a short. It’s just impossible for us cost wise. The short would be 30 seconds, and it’s over. One shot of Loki on Asgard." [...] On Fury and Black Panther, he remarked [...] "It’s very complicated to do: who plays those characters? And designing the costume, getting it going … We tried. We were there in development, and we tried, but they were very difficult for all the reasons I gave. And we don’t {{want to do something}} that’s half baked because it’s not good for us and it’s not good for our fans." [...] In February 2014, Pearce mentioned other shorts that he had written that never came to fruition, including ones based on Sin and Crossbones, Jessica Jones, and Damage Control.|$|E
60|$|Our history {{must now}} {{look a little}} backwards; and {{although}} it is rather foreign to our natural style of composition, it must speak more in narrative, and less in dialogue, rather telling what happened, than its effects upon the actors.

2500|$|Game {{director}} Justin Richmond {{explained that}} the game feels more open than other Uncharted games mainly due to the great new character creation feature. [...] "We're not an open-world game, we're {{never going to be}} an open-world game but; we can try. It's still up in the air how much gameplay we're going to let you wander around. But we aim to let you just ride a thousand miles off into the middle of nowhere and still find action and adventure as you go." [...] Ultimately the feel we want to get is, yeah, your character is lost in the desert. So it needs to feel like that. We aim to make it feel open-world." [...] In regards to whether or not PlayStation Move would be supported in Uncharted 3, Naughty Dog explained that [...] "A great Move game is a game made around Move and we started Uncharted long before that. It would be very <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> adjust it. We tried a couple of things but it wasn't making a lot of sense." ...|$|E
2500|$|When the Wu generals {{wanted to}} respond to the enemy's taunts, Lu Xun said, [...] "This must be a trick. We should observe first." [...] Earlier on, when the Shu army first arrived at Yiling, the Wu generals wanted to attack the enemy, but Lu Xun objected and said, [...] "Liu Bei is leading an army east to attack us and his army's morale is very high. Besides, his forces are based in high and mountainous terrain, so it's <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> attack them. Even if we manage to win, we can't {{completely}} defeat them. If we suffer any setback, our morale will be greatly affected and this isn't a small issue. Now, we should raise our troops' morale and make plans while waiting for changes in the situation. If we're on plains and flat ground, we should be worrying about sustaining heavy losses in skirmishes and charges. However, since the enemy is on mountainous terrain, they can't carry out an all-out assault because they're sandwiched between wood and rocks. We should take advantage of this weakness of theirs." [...] The Wu generals did not understand Lu Xun's reasoning and thought that he feared the enemy so they were very disgruntled with him.|$|E
2500|$|Issues arose after Santorum was {{defeated}} for re-election to the Senate in 2006, and Senator Craig Thomas began his {{tenure at the}} candy desk. Wyoming, the state he was representing, has no members of the National Confectioners Association, and therefore no candymakers large enough to donate hundreds of dollars of candy to fill the desk. Senate ethics rules [...] "forbid members accepting gifts worth $100 or more a year from a single source," [...] which can become a problem if {{a large amount of}} candy is consumed from the desk each year. An exception to this rule allows larger gifts of objects created or produced in the state the senator is from, as long as the items are primarily not used by the senator and his staff. This is so senators can [...] "offer visitors home-grown snacks, such as Florida orange juice or Georgia peanuts." [...] When asked about Thomas being in charge of the candy desk, Susan Smith, a representative from the National Confectioners Association, stated, [...] "We're happy to provide candy if there are [...] members...It would be <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> do now." [...] These issues were worked around by asking many small, local, Wyoming confectionery businesses and chocolatiers to give small amounts of candy that were rotated {{in and out of the}} desk.|$|E

2500|$|The {{existence}} (or potential existence) of {{such large}} numbers of molecular species is a combinatorial phenomenon: It arises from a relatively small set of features or modifications (such as post-translational modification or complex formation) that combine to dictate {{the state of the}} entire molecule or complex, {{in the same way that}} the existence of just a few choices in a coffee shop (small, medium or large, with or without milk, decaf or not, extra shot of espresso) quickly leads to a large number of possible beverages (24 in this case; each additional binary choice will double that number). Although it is <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> grasp the total numbers of possible combinations, it is usually not conceptually difficult to understand the (much smaller) set of features or modifications and the effect each of them has on the function of the biomolecule. The rate at which a molecule undergoes a particular reaction will usually depend mainly on a single feature or a small subset of features. It is the presence or absence of those features that dictates the reaction rate. The reaction rate is the same for two molecules that differ only in features which do not affect this reaction. Thus, the number of parameters will be much smaller than the number of reactions. (In the coffee shop example, adding an extra shot of espresso will cost 40 cent, no matter what size the beverage is and whether or not it has milk in it). It is such [...] "local rules" [...] that are usually discovered in laboratory experiments. Thus, a multi-state model can be conceptualised in terms of combinations of modular features and local rules. This means that even a model that can account for a vast number of molecular species and reactions is not necessarily conceptually complex.|$|E

25|$|However, {{these figures}} do not {{distinguish}} between people at a low or healthy weight who are in fact overweight, between those whose self-perception as being overweight is incorrect and those whose perception of being overweight is correct.
