5|$|Hanegraaff {{identified}} the second main healing current in the New Age movement as being holistic health. This {{emerged in the}} 1970s out of the free clinic movement of the 1960s, and has various connections with the <b>Human</b> <b>Potential</b> Movement. It emphasises {{the idea that the}} human individual is a holistic, interdependent relationship between mind, body, and spirit, and that healing is a process in which an individual becomes whole by integrating with the powers of the universe. A very wide array of methods are utilised within the holistic health movement, {{with some of the most}} common including acupuncture, reiki, biofeedback, chiropractic, yoga, kinesiology, homeopathy, aromatherapy iridology, massage and other forms of bodywork, meditation and visualisation, nutritional therapy, psychic healing, herbal medicine, healing using crystals, metals, music, chromotherapy, and reincarnation therapy. The use of crystal healing has become a particularly prominent visual trope within the New Age; this practice was not common in esotericism prior to their adoption in the New Age milieu.|$|E
5|$|This decade also {{witnessed}} {{the emergence of}} a variety of new religious movements and newly established religions in the United States, creating a spiritual milieu from which the New Age drew upon; these included the San Francisco Zen Center, Transcendental Meditation, Soka Gakkai, the Inner Peace Movement, the Church of All Worlds, and the Church of Satan. Although there had been an established interest in Asian religious ideas in the U.S. from at least the eighteenth-century, many of these new developments were variants of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Sufism which had been imported to the West from Asia following the U.S. government's decision to rescind the Asian Exclusion Act in 1965. In 1962 the Esalen Institute was established in Big Sur, California. It was from Esalen and other similar personal growth centers which had developed links to humanistic psychology that the <b>human</b> <b>potential</b> movement emerged, which would also come to exert a strong influence on the New Age.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this thesis provides a comparative study {{of the impact of}} Process Safety Management System (PSMS) performance and Human Error rates on off-site risk from two major hazards sites in Malaysia. One of the sites was built and run by a multinational company {{until a few years ago}} while the other was built and run by a local company since its inception. The sites handle bulk quantities of ammonia for downstream distribution. The study considers: the assessment of the sites PSMS performance using a structured audit technique the assessment of <b>human</b> error <b>potential</b> from ammonia road-tanker filling operations assessing the impact of site PSMS and <b>human</b> error <b>potential</b> on off-site risk from the sites investigating the possibility of linking the assessment of site PSMS performance with <b>human</b> error <b>potential</b> Results of Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) conducted on the two sites showed a significant difference in terms of individual and societal risk when site specific PSMS performance and <b>human</b> error <b>potential</b> are taken into consideration. The use of site specific Management Factor (MF) and site specific Human Error Probabilities (HEPs) produces a significant impact on the results of the off-site risk as compared to estimates of risk based only on generic failure rates. This finding emphasized the need to consider explicitly the contribution of site specific PSMS performance and <b>human</b> error <b>potential</b> in major hazard risk assessment especially in developing countries like Malaysia where there exists significant differences on these factors between locally owned and multinational sites. The approach to link the results of the site specific PSMS performance audit with the assessment of <b>human</b> error <b>potential</b> was found to be inadequate to describe all the influences which will be exerted on the reliability of individual tasks involving <b>human</b> error <b>potential...</b>|$|R
