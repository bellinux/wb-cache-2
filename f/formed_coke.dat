The French Revolution a year earlier had torn the Whig party in half, with Coke and Fox in the isolated minority who supported the revolutionaries as their acts became more brutal. With the declaration of war in 1793, an impact was finally felt in Britain with a rise in agricultural prices and rent. It also led to the establishment of local yeomanry forces to defend the country, something Coke opposed. This reduced his popularity in Norfolk and led to suspicions he might be a Jacobin, {{to the point where he}} was forced to publicly declare that he was not a Republican and [...] "detested their principles". Eventually, late September 1798, he raised the Holkham Yeoman Cavalry, commanding it as a Major, to defend against any invasion. This unit was dissolved in 1802 with the Peace of Amiens, but after war broke out again a year later more volunteer regiments were <b>formed.</b> <b>Coke</b> was notably absent from any preparations for defence, feeling that the risks of invasion were exaggerated, but was eventually persuaded by public opinion to reform the Yeoman Cavalry in 1803; it was again dissolved in 1805.|$|E

40|$|Char, {{the major}} {{co-product}} of mild coal gasification, represents about 70 {{percent of the}} total product yield. The only viable use for the char is in the production of <b>formed</b> <b>coke.</b> Early work to develop <b>formed</b> <b>coke</b> used char from a pilot plant sized mild gasification unit (MGU), which was based on commercial units of the COALITE plant in England. <b>Formed</b> <b>coke</b> was made at a bench-scale production level using MGU chars from different coals. An evolutionary <b>formed</b> <b>coke</b> development process over a two-year period resulted in <b>formed</b> <b>coke</b> production at bench-scale levels that met metallurgical industries` specifications. In an ASTM D 5341 reactivity test by a certified lab, the coke tested CRI 30. 4 and CSR 67. 0 which is excellent. The standard is CRI 55. In 1991, a continuous 1000 pounds per hour coal feed mild coal gasification pilot plant (CMGU) was completed. The gasification unit is a heated unique screw conveyor designed to continuously process plastic coal, vent volatiles generated by pyrolysis of coal, and convert the plastic coal to free flowing char. The screw reactor auxiliary components are basic solids materials handling equipment. The screw reactor will convert coal to char and volatile co-products at a rate greater than 1000 pounds per hour of coal feed. <b>Formed</b> <b>coke</b> from CMGU char is comparable to that from the MGU char. In pilot-plant test runs, up to 20 tons of foundry coke were produced. Three <b>formed</b> <b>coke</b> tests at commercial foundries were successful. In all of the cupola tests, the iron temperature and composition data indicated that the <b>formed</b> <b>coke</b> performed satisfactorily. No negative change in the way the cupola performed was noticed. The last 20 -ton test was 100 percent CTC/DOE coke. With conventional coke in this cupola charging rates were 10 charges per hour. The <b>formed</b> <b>coke</b> charges were 11 to 12 charges per hour. This equates to a higher melt rate.

30|$|According to {{the results}} in Fig.  7 b, it can be {{concluded}} that the amount of carbon deposition increases with increasing temperature. At 450  °C, the amount of carbon deposition is higher (0.24). Generally, a high operating temperature enhances the reactions involved in coke formation such as oligomerization, cyclization, hydrogen transfer and alkylation to yield larger hydrocarbon species. At 350  °C catalyst deactivates rapidly and the amount of carbon deposition is lower (0.189) in this temperature. Ethylene and propylene, which are first hydrocarbons formed during MTO reaction, are not likely to produce aromatic hydrocarbons at low temperature. At temperature range of 375 – 425  °C, the amount of <b>formed</b> <b>coke</b> is equally (0.2), it means that the character of coke is similar at these temperatures [12].

Low liquid yield of vacuum residue (VR) cracking was obtained with fresh BFC and FCC catalysts because of their strong acidity and thus activity.

40|$|Catalyst {{deactivation}} by {{coke formation}} {{has been investigated}} in three heterogeneous catalytic processes, propane dehydrogenation, acetylene hydrogenation and hydrogenation of vegetable oil. Palladium and/or platinum supported on alumina were used as catalysts in all reactions. Coke formed during propane dehydrogenation has been studied by weighing in a microbalance reactor and by temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). Furthermore, {{the coverage of the}} metal surface has been investigated by reacting hydrogen and deuterium on coked catalysts. It was found that coke covered the metal surface immediately after the catalyst was exposed to the reaction mixture. It was also found that the presence of hydrogen reduced the deactivation and the coke formation rate. It was even possible to activate the catalyst by changing the reaction conditions to a more hydrogen-rich mixture. This "reversible" deactivation behavior was investigated further in transient experiments, and a model was proposed which included reversible and irreversible coke. The decrease in selectivity to ethene formation with time on stream, during acetylene hydrogenation, was investigated on palladium catalysts. It was found that the change in selectivity was not an effect of coke concentration. Instead, a low surface coverage of hydrogen resulted in less overall coke formation, but the coke was more harmful and affected the selectivity for ethene formation negatively. From experiments, in which deuterium was added to the reaction mixture and the composition of the <b>formed</b> <b>coke</b> was analyzed by TPO, it was proposed that the coke was formed via half-hydrogenated surface species (C 2 H 3). Hydrogenation of vegetable oil in liquid phase was carried out using palladium and platinum catalysts supported on. alfa. - and. gamma. -alumina. It was found that only palladium on. gamma. -alumina deactivated during the hydrogenation process. A mechanism was suggested where conjugated dienes, which are formed to a larger extent on palladium than on platinum, were responsible for the formation of the coke that deactivated the catalyst.

Carbon on the metal reduces that carbonate to formate by forming CO. The formate decomposesrapidly to CO and a surface hydroxyl group. Hydroxyl groups recombine and form water or react further with methane to CO and hydrogen (steam reforming). When the rate of methane decomposition and carbonate reduction are in balance, the catalystic activity remains stable.

40|$|Zeolite {{catalysts}} {{are used}} in a large variety of (petro-) chemical conversions. The acid sites in these materials {{are responsible for the}} chemical transformation, while their well-defined crystallographic architecture offers unique molecular size and shape selectivity. The finite availability of crude oil demands for new technologies that utilize alternative feedstocks (like biomass, natural gas or coal) for the production of chemicals. In these novel conversions zeolite catalyst can play an important role. In hydrocarbon processing, the formation of carbonaceous deposits is usually inevitable. These undesired by-products are the result of secondary reactions and influence the performance of catalyst materials with possible consequences for their industrial application. In order to develop new and improved catalytic crystals, a thorough understanding of their working principles is essential. The use of spectroscopic characterization techniques has thereby become an important tool. The research described in this PhD thesis examines coke formation processes in zeolite catalysts with in-situ micro-spectroscopic techniques. These tools are applied on large micron-sized zeolite crystals that reveal spatial and temporal heterogeneities in the coke growth process at the individual catalyst particle level. UV-Vis micro-spectroscopy identifies the chemical nature of the <b>formed</b> <b>coke</b> species, while confocal fluorescence microscopy allows studying the migration of these compounds within an individual zeolite crystal. The first part of the thesis deals with the Methanol-to-Olefin (MTO) conversion. A comparative study between H-SAPO- 34 and H-ZSM- 5 zeolite crystals illustrates the influence of the zeolite framework topology on the coke formation process. Low reaction temperatures generate mild coke formation, whereas more severe reaction conditions allow the growth of larger carbonaceous deposits. This effect is further enhanced with increasing Brønsted acid site density. Bulk analytical methods show that the model H-ZSM- 5 zeolite crystals remain active after a number of regeneration treatments and despite their large crystal dimensions display conversion characteristics that are close to the conversion activities of H-ZSM- 5 catalysts containing smaller crystal size. These zeolites are subsequently used to investigate the coke growth process during the aromatization of light naphtha (LNA) derivatives. Olefins and paraffins are thereby compared. Increasing reactant chain length generates more severe coke deposition, while methyl branching of the hydrocarbons results in coke deposits of more confined size. A catalytically inactive silicalite- 1 shell, covering the H-ZSM- 5 zeolite catalyst, prevents the formation of large carbonaceous species at the external surface of the crystal. Finally, fluorescence microscopy illustrates how the physicochemical interplay between reactant and zeolite affects the location of coke formation during the etherification of biomass-based alcohols with long linear alkenes in H-Beta zeolite crystals...|$|E
30|$|The {{mechanism}} {{responsible for}} migration {{of silver and}} condensation across the SDC layer is unclear. It is unlikely that thermal effect alone is responsible for Ag migration to SDC. The temperature distribution along the cell was relatively uniform and silver deposited in the SDC layer was observed only at the cell inlet (the most active part of the cell). Silver migration could {{be a result of}} electromigration [6] or it can be associated with the formation of Ag (g) species and vapour transport to the cathode–electrolyte face followed by reduction to metal phase [11]. Ag (g) has higher vapour pressure than Ag 2 O (g) at the SOFC operation temperature. Therefore, it is thought Ag (g) formation and penetration in SDC are possible for this mechanism. However, electromigration and evaporation/deposition of silver are too slow to be alone directly responsible for the observed rate of silver migration during the electrode polarisation [37]. Mosialek et al. [16] observed silver migration on the YSZ electrolyte in the potential range −[*] 0.2 – 0.5  V; no migration was observed without polarisation. In addition, no migration was observed without the electrolyte. They concluded that for the formation of silver dendrites, it is necessary to have a potential difference between the cathode (with Ag) and the oxygen ion conductor. Therefore, silver migration is not correlated directly with current density. Similar results were reported for the GDC electrolyte [37]. The mechanism responsible for silver mass transport is difficult to distinguish. Silver migration is possibly related to electron transfer and oxygen flux. The flow of electrons can promote silver electromigration. This can explain the agglomeration of silver at the edge of electrolyte since electrolyte can conduct only ions. The short 1 – 2  h OCV break in the cell power generation affected the performance of tested cells. Rapid cell degradation was often seen directly after OCV. Since the OCV state is not conductive for thermal or electromigration of silver [35], the cathode polarisation must promote silver migration. Moving from one state (including OCV) of operation to another could affect cell performance. The process of cell passivation/activation resulted in the difference in temperature distribution along and across the cell and could result in some microcrack formation in the electrolyte. Also, the risk of coke deposition on the anode during OCV was significant because no steam was formed from fuel electrooxidation and only 60 – 70 % of fuel was converted on the CPOX catalyst [28]. <b>Formed</b> <b>coke</b> and temperature gradient may also result in microcracks formation in the electrolyte structure. However, SEM scans did not confirm electrolyte cracks. Simner et al. [11] observed that fresh cell was not affected by holding it under OCV. This confirms our result that short-circuit occurs directly after a short OCV break in the cell operation if the cell was in operation for several hours. Another possible explanation is that during OCV period (no current flow through electrodes), silver deposited in the SDC layer was saturated with oxygen. This oxygen was reduced after the cell returned to the operation mode with the flow of electrons. According to Simner et al. [11], during OCV, {{it is possible that the}} formation of oxygen-containing species can block the oxygen charge transport.|$|E

Prolonging the pyrolysis volatile residence time in the shale ash bed from 0 to 10 s decreased the shale oil yield by 31. 0 % but increased the fraction of gasoline and diesel (boiling point 773 K) was cracked to increase the yields of light oil and pyrolysis gas (especially H- 2 and CH 4). The shale ash bed temperature was the key factor affecting the product distribution. The catalytic effect of shale ash lowered the shale oil cracking temperature for achieving {{the same degree of}} oil cracking. The catalytic activity of shale ash for cracking shale oil was shown to be closely dependent on the metal oxides in the ash. While CaO and Na 2 O tended to inhibit the formation of coke and to promote catalytic reforming, Fe 2 O 3 showed good activity in cracking shale oil and <b>forming</b> <b>coke...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} in use of reducing agents in blast furnace (BF) ironmaking has been significantly improved over the years. At most blast furnaces, auxiliary fuels are injected to replace some of the coke. To further reduce carbon consumption, prevention of losses and modification of raw materials or process conditions are required. In this study coke properties, their development during the descent in the BF under different process conditions, contribution to off-gas dust as well as modifications of coke aiming for reduced energy consumption in the BF have been investigated. The changes in chemical composition of coke ash, mineral phase developments and coke participation in the endothermic gasification reaction with CO 2 and coke graphitisation were studied. Also, {{in order to reduce}} the losses of material in the off-gas, a characterisation of the off-gas dust and its connection to BF conditions and coke property development in the BF has been made. Coke properties have been studied in the laboratory and in samples taken out from different parts of the LKAB Experimental BF (EBF®) during varied operational set-ups. Properties of coke from the BF high-temperature region were studied via tuyere core-drilling of samples from the EBF and an industrial-scale BF. The results showed that the coarser dry flue dust is mechanically <b>formed.</b> <b>Coke</b> fines originating from the upper shaft dominates the coarser fractions. Gasification in the shaft has a negligible effect on the high quality coke used in the EBF. The finer dust fraction, sludge, consists mainly of chemically formed spherical particles in the order of < 1 μm. Gaseous compounds formed in the BF high-temperature area precipitate from the ascending gas as the temperature decreases. Flow conditions in the top of the BF and the fluidisation properties of fine particles determine out-flow of off-gas dust. Low off-gas temperatures, and thus lower off-gas velocities, are favourable for low flue dust amounts expelled from the blast furnace. The strength and reactivity of coke at high temperature, measured in the standardised test, was compared with coke from basket samples charged into the EBF. Coke reactivity in the EBF is considerably lower for all coke types studied compared to coke studied in the CRI/CSR test. Due to higher gasification in the laboratory test the ash content is higher in that test. However, gaseous components in the EBF, such as recirculated alkali, contribute to changed ash composition in BF coke. Laboratory studies using fixed bed reactor (FBR) and a thermo gravimetric analyser (TGA) on the same material, original as well as Fe- and Ca-activated coke samples, identified the effects on reaction behaviour and were the basis for selection of the potentially best method for activating nut coke to achieve higher reactivity with CO 2 when charged into iron-bearing layers. All types of Fe- and Ca-containing activation agents used increase the apparent reaction rates for coke with low reactivity and contents of catalytic components in the ash. Activation with a solution of Fe(NO 3) 3 has the strongest effect on the reactivity, followed by slurry of Ca(OH) 2 and iron oxides (Fe 2 O 3 and Fe 3 O 4) in descending order. Use of a non-specific weight loss in TGA as a basis for apparent reaction rate demands measurements in a temperature interval free from other reactions involving the activation agents. The reaction rate is reduced when CO is present in the reaction gas. Aiming for a method for determination of thermal history in BF samples the correlation between temperature and coke graphitisation was studied using three different data processing methods for removing the influence from overlapping peaks during X-ray diffraction measurements. Structural changes in coke during heat treatment are accompanied by chemical transformations in ash compounds and changed the pattern of disturbing peaks. Key ash phases were SiO 2 and mullite. At high temperatures (~ 1500 °C) the SiO 2 peaks are reduced in magnitude and finally disappear to be replaced with SiC peaks. The graphitisation was correlated with temperature and time in argon atmosphere and the impact from hot metal and slag was investigated. The graphitisation degree in coke samples from the EBF raceway and hearth was estimated and the evolution of structural order was found to be suitable in order to estimate the thermal history of coke in blast furnaces.

40|$|M. Sc. (Chemistry) Catalyst {{deactivation}} is {{a process}} that {{plays an important role in}} many catalytic processes. The <b>forming</b> of <b>coke</b> is in this respect the most common cause for deactivation. The research that has been done here has tried to give some insight into the mechanism of cokeforming with the help of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (F) 'IR). For this purpose a cobalt catalyst on an alumina carrier was used. The influence of the reaction time, the carbon monoxide to hydrogen ratio and the temperature on the rate and amount of <b>coke</b> <b>formed</b> was determined. A cell was developed that could be heated up to 500 °C and could simultaneously be used in FTIR-spectroscopy in situ research. This enabled the determination of spectra at certain time intervals. In this way the development of the characteristic bands could be followed. Two other methods were used to support the transmission spectra : Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy and the burning of the coke from the catalyst. The latter was done to determine the amount of <b>coke</b> that had <b>formed</b> on the catalyst surface during the run. The amount of coke decreased with an increase of the hydrogen to carbonmonoxide ratio in the feed. Temperature also had a marked influence on coke formation: It decreased at higher temperatures. As expected the amount of coke increased with reaction time. In general the coke contained only a small hydrogen content. In conclusion it may be mentioned that the results obtained can contribute to the characterization of <b>coke</b> <b>formed</b> on Fischer-Tropsch catalysts...|$|R

30|$|Figure  16 a {{shows that}} 30  min after {{introducing}} the feed into the reactor at 230  °C, the initial overall conversion rates were 52 and 59  wt%, respectively, for the monometallic catalysts containing 10 and 20  wt% Ni. After 180  min on stream, {{there was a}} large drop in activity to 30 and 45  wt%, then a sustained and rapid deactivation rate until a pseudo-stable state was reached at activity levels of 10 and 16  wt%, respectively, persisting until the reactions terminated. Deactivation was also found to be very rapid for the monometallic catalysts containing Ni at 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2  wt%. This behaviour may be explained in terms of the poor hydrogenating capacity of Ni compared to Pt [44], making it more difficult for the Ni atoms to be fully reduced, so that not enough Ni metallic sites were available to sustain the reaction, since the hydroisomerisation reaction includes a dehydrogenation step [40, 42]. Therefore, selectivity to form the C 7 isomers was lower than for the catalysts containing Pt, while higher cracked and cyclic product yields were obtained, which means that higher <b>coke</b> content was <b>formed,</b> possibly blocking and poisoning the active sites of the catalysts during the deactivation reaction. In addition, the low stability of catalysts with higher nickel content may be explained by the tendency of Ni to polymerise olefins and hence to <b>form</b> <b>coke</b> [42].|$|R
30|$|The {{nature of}} the {{carbonaceous}} residues also changes with reaction time. The change in the {{nature of the}} coke is due to polymerisation, multi-side reactions and loss of hydrogen content. The deposits convert to more condensed and hydrogen deficient coke with the passage of time and then finally <b>form</b> graphitic type <b>coke.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{formation}} of dicoronylene in hydrocracking reactors {{is a serious}} problem because its low solubility make it precipitate in any cooler part of the reactor flow path. This causes plugging of flow lines that require periodic shutdown and removal of the reddish deposits. Dicoronylene is also a constituent of <b>coke</b> <b>formed</b> on hydrocracking catalysts, which reduces their activity.|$|R
