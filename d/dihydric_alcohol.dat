40|$|Nishimura and Kubo {{isolated}} {{a strain}} of Fungi Imperfecti which produces an antifungal metabolite. The metabolite was obtained in a crystalline state from the mycelia extract. The elementary analysis and spectral data implied that the compound is a <b>dihydric</b> <b>alcohol</b> containing a carbonyl group. A crude metabolite was purified by acetylation and a preparative TLC to give colorless needles, m. p. 129 - 130 ℃, of the molecular formula CzoHl,Os. In the NMR spectrum of the acetate two acetoxyl groups and a secondary methyl group were inferred from the singlet signals at r 7. 91, 8. 0, and 8. 77 respectively. A couple of quartet at r 2. 8 (1 H) and 4. 35 (1 H) were indicative of the partial structure (B). Based on the molecular formula and spectral data, it was deduced that the antifungal metabolite is a dihydroxy bicyclic diene ester (or lactone) or a dihydroxy monocyclic triene ester (or lactone). The physical properties including IR and NMR data of the acetate agreed in every respect with those of brefeldin A diacetate...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHydrophilic {{interaction}} LC {{was investigated}} in hydro-organic and nonaqueous elution modes on a titania column by using a set of N-methyl xanthines as neutral polar probes. To get information regarding the mechanisms that are behind the discrimination of these analytes in hydrophilic interaction, we focused our study on the type and amount of organic modifier as a critical yet rarely explored mobile phase parameter. Several alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol were studied as substitutes to acetonitrile in hydro-organic elution mode. Compared to silica, {{the investigation of the}} eluotropic series of these alcohols on titania highlighted a different implication in the retention mechanism of the xanthine derivatives. At low amounts of protic solvents, the adsorption mainly characterized the retention of analytes on bare silica; whereas mixed interactions including adsorption and ligand exchange were identified on native titania. To investigate the peculiar behavior of alcohols on the metal oxide, methanol, ethanol, and ethylene glycol were tested in replacement of water in polar-organic elution mode. Distinctive effects on the chromatographic retention and selectivity of xanthines were noticed for the <b>dihydric</b> <b>alcohol,</b> which was found to be a stronger eluting component than water on titania...|$|E

40|$|Ethylene glycol is a colorless, odorless, sweet, {{water-soluble}} substance {{from the}} group of <b>dihydric</b> <b>alcohols.</b> As a result of taking ethylene-containing material for suicide purpose or as an accident, serious metabolic acidosis, central nervous system depression and oliguric acute renal failure occur. Early diagnosis and treatment can reduce mortality at a significant level. We present a case with severe metabolic acidosis, coma and acute renal failure due to ethylene glycol intoxication after drinking antifreeze accidentally.

40|$|Poly(ethylene succinate) (PES), poly(butylene succinate) (PBS), and poly(hexylene succinate) (PHS), were {{synthesized}} using {{succinic acid}} and different <b>dihydric</b> <b>alcohols</b> as materials. Enzymatic degradability by cutinase {{of the three}} kinds of polyesters was studied, {{as well as their}} solid-state properties. The biodegradation behavior relied heavily on the distance between ester groups, crystallinity, and the hydrophilicity-hydrophobicity balance of polyester surfaces. The weight loss through degradation of the three kinds of polyesters with different hydroxyl monomers took place in the order PHS > PBS > PES. The degradation behavior of the polyesters before and after degradation was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography, and thermogravimetric analysis. The decrease in relative intensity at 1800 – 1650 estedpolyesters were degraded simultaneously. The frequencies of the crystalline and amorphous bands were almost identical before and after degradation. Thus, enzymatic degradation did not change the crystalline structure but destroyed it, and the degree of crystallinity markedly decreased. The molecular weight and polydispersity index only changed slightly. The thermal stability of the three kinds of polyesters decreased during enzymatic degradation...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} here {{literature and}} our experimental data concerning microbial synthesis using waste biodiesel production, mono- and <b>dihydric</b> <b>alcohols</b> (1, 3 -propanediol, 2, 3 -butanediol, butanol, ethanol), polyols (mannitol, erythritol, arabitol), organic acids (citric, succinic, lactic, glyceric), polymers and compounds with a complex structure (polysaccharides, polyhydroxyalkanoates, surfactants, cephalosporin, cyanocobalamin). In some mentioned cases recombinant producer strains were used. It was shown {{that due to}} the presence of potential inhibitors in the composition of technical (crude) glycerol (methanol, sodium and potassium salts), the efficiency of synthesis of most microbial products on such a substrate is lower than on the purified glycerol. However, the need of utilization of this toxic waste (storage and processing of crude glycerol is a serious environmental problem due to the high alkalinity and the content of methanol in it), compensates the lower rates of synthesis of the final product. Furthermore, currently considering the volumes of crude glycerol formed during the production of biodiesel, microbial technologies are preferred for its utilization, allowing realizing biosynthesis of practically valuable metabolites in the environment with the highest possible concentration of this waste. Using of crude glycerol as a substrate will reduce the cost of products of microbial synthesis and increase the profitability of biodiesel production...|$|R
40|$|Within the akin {{of animals}} are {{situated}} various glands which secrete {{their products to}} the outer surface of the skin. The glands exist in many forms and their functions are diverse. A satisfactory classification based on the morphology of the glands has been worked out and the glands of the vertebrata are recognised as belonging to three main types: - holocrine, eccrine and apocrine glands. In man the holocrine glands {{are referred to as}} sebaceous and the eccrine as sudoriferous or sweat glands. These terms are often used also for animals. Comparatively few animal skin glands or secretions have been investigated chemically. The sebaceous secretion of the sheep, wool wax, has been much investigated owing to the commercial value of this product; and the author participated for some years in studies of wool wax at the National Chemical Research Laboratory, Pretoria. In Chapter I is summarised the present knowledge of wool wax chemistry, including contributions from this laboratory into the investigation of <b>dihydric</b> <b>alcohols</b> and hydroxy-acids and the syntheses of iso-acids which occur in wool wax. Skin secretions which have no commercial applications are nevertheless of great interest from a physiological and biochemical point of view. In this respect human skin secretions may naturally attract more attention than those of other animals. Their investigation may prove rewarding in throwing further light upon the studies of dermatological disorders in general, and more particularly upon the all-important problem of skin cancer. A study of human sebaceous secretions was taken up in this laboratory by the author; the aliphatic alcohols and some polycyclic hydrocarbons present were investigated. The chemistry of human sebaceous secretions is reviewed in Chapter II. Chapter III reviews work of other investigators on various skin gland secretions. The "scent" glands of musk deer and other animals and the "preen" glands of some birds have been investigated. Some materials of human origin such as ear wax, which are considered as related to sebaceous secretions, are included in this review. Natural fats and waxes are generally of complex composition and early workers did not succeed in isolating many pure components from such materials. As a result of improved techniques and methods considerable {{progress has been made in}} the last few years towards the elucidation of the fine structures of fats and waxes...|$|R
