40|$|The {{effects of}} {{cross-coupled}} stimuli on the semicircular canals are {{shown to be}} influenced by the position of the <b>subject's</b> <b>head</b> with respect to gravity and the axis of rotation, but not by the <b>subject's</b> <b>head</b> position relative to the trunk. Seventeen healthy <b>subjects</b> made <b>head</b> yaw movements out of the horizontal plane while lying on a horizontal platform (MIT short radius centrifuge) rotating at 23 rpm about an earth-vertical axis. The subjects reported the magnitude and duration of the illusory pitch or roll sensations elicited by the cross-coupled rotational stimuli acting on the semicircular canals. The results suggest an influence of head position relative to gravity. The magnitude estimation is higher and the sensation decays more slowly when the head's final position is toward nose-up (gravity in the <b>subject's</b> <b>head</b> x-z-plane) compared to when the head is turned toward the side (gravity in the <b>subject's</b> <b>head</b> y-z-plane). The results are discussed with respect to artificial gravity in space and the possible role of pre-adaptation to cross-coupled angular accelerations on earth...|$|R
40|$|IFLA Principles Underlying <b>Subject</b> <b>Heading</b> Languages were {{published}} in 1995 and translated into Slovene in 2002. They try to recover the theory of indexing languages from an analysis of <b>subject</b> <b>heading</b> languages {{that are used in}} libraries around the world. These guidelines are illustrated with examples from Splošni slovenski geslovnik (Slovene General Subject Headings, Sears List of Subject Headings, and Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH). Studies on the use of LCSH by users of library catalogs were reviewed to determine weaknesses of the IFLA Principles. Changes were suggested,which would make subject retrieval easier for users. The reviewed <b>subject</b> <b>heading</b> languages reflect the needs of traditional librarians and card catalogs. These often conflict with user needs, characteristics of online catalogs and modern librarians. <b>Subject</b> <b>heading</b> languages could be improved if we would take into account the vast knowledge of user behavior and capabilities of information technology. For a better subject access to library materials, we also need to understand the processes of subject analysis and subject description...|$|R

However, conventional manual procedure and robotized TMS are currently unable to precisely position the TMS coil because of unconstrained <b>subject’s</b> <b>head</b> movement and excessive contact force between the coil and <b>subject’s</b> <b>head.</b> This paper addressed this challenge by proposing an adaptive neuro-fuzzy force control to enable low contact force with a moving target surface.

The results show the ability of the proposed force control scheme to compensate <b>subject’s</b> <b>head</b> motions while maintaining desired contact force, thus allowing for more accurate and repeatable TMS procedures...|$|R

40|$|The Master's {{thesis is}} focused on the Polythematic Structured <b>Subject</b> <b>Heading</b> System, an {{indexing}} language created at the State Technical Library and used for document indexing and retrieval both in this library and in other institutions. The objective of the thesis is to evaluate the history of the <b>subject</b> <b>heading</b> system and suggest ways how it can be further developed. First of all the history of the <b>subject</b> <b>heading</b> system is described, both in the context of indexing and classification of documents in the State Technical Library and trends in knowledge organization in general. Then the current situation of the system is analyzed both from the formal and factual point of view. Tools used for the maintenance and presentation of the system are highlighted. The thesis also includes the description of relevant processes and suggests ways how to optimize the processes. Updating, maintenance and marketing are especially emphasized. The possibilities to use modern information and communication technologies for the further development of the <b>subject</b> <b>heading</b> system are described in detail. Authority files, markup languages and on-line library catalogues are included in the analysis. A draft of a new development policy for the system and new maintenance and indexing rules are also part of the thesis...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{aimed at a}} further {{evaluation}} {{of the role of}} glycoproteins in the formation of cholesterol gall stones in man. An electron microscopic morphometric study of the gall bladder epithelium was performed in six gall stone <b>free</b> <b>subjects</b> and 12 gall stone patients. Six of the gall stone patients were treated with ursodeoxycholic acid three weeks before cholecystectomy. The number and the volume density of the mucin containing secretory granules, were not significantly increased in gall stone patients compared with gall stone <b>free</b> <b>subjects.</b> Treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid did not affect the number or volume density of the secretory granules. Thus, these results do not give evidence for that the degree of cholesterol saturation influences mucin content in the gall bladder wall of man. A major new finding was that gall stone patients had a markedly reduced total lysosome area and volume density of lysosomes compared with gall stone <b>free</b> <b>subjects,</b> a finding which may be related to a decreased intracellular degradation of protein and/or mucin...|$|R
