40|$|Abstract-To {{facilitate}} {{natural regeneration}} of loblolly (Pinus taeda L.) and shortleaf pines (I? ecbinata Mill.) in an overstocked, uneven-aged pine stand in southeastern Arkansas, hardwoods were controlled by either basal injection of TordonQ 101 R. soil application of Velpat @ L, or rotary mowing {{followed by a}} broadcast spray of TordonB 101 applied over the hardwood stubble. After hardwood control, an <b>improvement</b> <b>cut</b> reduced merchantable pine basal area from 97 to 70 f? per acre, just before a better-than-average pine seed crop. Two subsequent improvement cuts in July 1987 and June 1991 left 55 and 48 ft 2 per acre, respectively, in merchantable pine basal area. Twelve years after hardwood control, all plots had an adequate density of pine regeneration for uneven-aged stands, but dominant pine regeneration on treated plots averaged 16 ft taller and 2. 2 in. larger in groundline diameter than the dominants on untreated plots...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} partial cutting in an immature, complex {{stand in the}} Interior Cedar [...] Hemlock zone are {{analyzed}} 40 years after treatment. Three partial cutting treatments [...] - <b>improvement</b> <b>cut,</b> diameter-limit cut, and salvage cut [...] - were carried out in southern British Columbia. The results are presented for individual trees and the entire stand. Partial cutting {{had little effect on}} gross increment but a large effect on net increment over the 40 -year period. The study demonstrates that partial cutting can be used to recover anticipated mortality. Partial cutting did not appear to increase the incidence of root rot, nor did it alter the pattern of ecological succession in the stand. iii ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This experiment was established by Michael Stewart, and was maintained and measured over the years by Keith Illingworth, Chris Thompson, and John Pollack.

The study provided a framework {{to examine the effects}} of common fuel treatments on treatment longevity, fuel development, and potential fire behavior. Treatments were implemented in each of three blocks of approximately 36  ha (9  ha per treatment unit), using a randomized factorial design: two levels of thinning (thinned and unthinned) by two levels of prescribed burning (burned and unburned), for a total of four treatment levels (no-action control, burn-only, thin-only, thin+burn), with one treatment replicate per block. Prescription intensity was designed to maintain 80 % overstory tree survival given a wildfire during 80 th percentile weather conditions (Weatherspoon 2000). Units were cut in 2001 and burned in 2002, creating twelve 9  ha experimental units. The silvicultural cutting prescription was a combined low thinning and <b>improvement</b> <b>cut</b> to a residual basal area of 11.5  m 2  ha− 1, favoring retention of ponderosa pine and western larch over Douglas-fir (although Douglas-fir maintained a significant presence in residual overstories; Metlen and Fiedler 2006). Burning treatments were spring burns with wind speeds less than 13  km h− 1. Burns were generally low severity, with pockets of high severity in two of the thin+burn treatments. Fiedler et al. (2010) analyzed treatment effect on stand structure and short-term growth, and Stephens et al. (2009) summarized short-term woody fuel and potential fire behavior responses to treatment across western Fire and Fire Surrogate sites.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Quantifying the {{relevance}} of different plant traits for yield and quality under different growth conditions can improve the efficiency of a breeding programme. Crop models are powerful tools to give guidance to breeding, because model calculations enable the analysis of many different situations (sensitivity analysis and scenario studies). Three case studies of using crop growth models to evaluate physiological traits potentially used in breeding programmes are presented. The models used are explanatory models, with several submodels; e. g., for light interception, leaf photosynthesis, organ formation and biomass partitioning. Case study 1 : It is hypothesized that yield <b>improvement</b> of <b>cut</b> chrysanthemum {{can be obtained by}} a higher specific leaf area (SLA) or a higher light-saturated leaf photosynthetic rate (Pg,max). Model calculations showed that for a winter planting, a higher SLA has more impact on yield than improving Pg,max, whereas for a summer-grown crop Pg,max and SLA are of equal importance for yield. Case study 2 : Regarding the yield of tomato, it is hypothesized that new genotypes, with two leaves in between trusses, may improve yield. In tomato cultivars generally there are three leaves in between two trusses. The formation of fewer leaves favours dry-matter partitioning towards the fruits, but it also decreases leaf area index (LAI), resulting in less light interception.
