5|$|The <b>joke</b> <b>in</b> {{the episode}} about Fox Mulder's {{predicted}} death being by autoerotic asphyxiation {{was inspired by}} previous jokes in the series about Mulder's interest in pornography. It was also inspired by a book Morgan had read on homicide investigations. While Morgan noted that he hypothesized {{that might be a}} way that Mulder would die, the line was meant as a joke.|$|E
5|$|The {{localization}} {{was done}} by the philosophy of keeping true to the spirit of the original Japanese, making dialogue sound like what a native speaker of English would say instead of strictly adhering the original's exact wording. The localization editor, Ben Bateman, did this by looking at the writing from a wider view, line by line or scene by scene rather than word by word or sentence by sentence, and thinking about how to convey the same ideas in English. Most parts of the game that include a <b>joke</b> <b>in</b> the localization also have a <b>joke</b> <b>in</b> the Japanese version, but a different one; Bateman did however try to make similar types of jokes, with similar contents and ideas. The game's use of Japanese language puns led to problems, as many of them relied on Japanese dialects to function; for these, Bateman replaced them with new puns in English. He was given mostly free rein in what he could change or add, as long as it did not disrupt the plot.|$|E
5|$|Cricket {{characters}} {{feature in}} the Walt Disney animated movies Pinocchio (1940), where Jiminy Cricket becomes the title character's conscience, and in Mulan (1998), where Cri-kee is carried in a cage {{as a symbol of}} luck, in the Asian manner. The Crickets was the name of Buddy Holly's rock and roll band; Holly's home town baseball team in the 1990s was called the Lubbock Crickets. Cricket is the name of a US children's literary magazine founded in 1973; it uses a cast of insect characters. The sound of crickets is often used in media to emphasize silence, often for comic effect after an awkward <b>joke,</b> <b>in</b> a similar manner to tumbleweed.|$|E

5|$|Inspector Lomax {{was played}} by Jack Warner, who {{appeared}} by {{arrangement with the}} J. Arthur Rank Organisation, with whom he was contracted.

Shortly after finishing The Quatermass Xperiment, he made his first appearance on television in the role he is most associated with, as the title character in Dixon of Dock Green (1955–76). Warner plays Lomax in a lighthearted fashion and there is a running <b>joke</b> <b>in</b> the film involving Lomax's futile attempts to find the time to have a shave with his electric razor.|$|E

5|$|Sheng Long is a {{character}} hoax related to the Street Fighter series, created by Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) as an April Fools' prank in 1992 (in an issue published mid-February). The joke, based upon a mistranslation that suggested the existence of {{a character}} named Sheng Long in the Capcom fighting game Street Fighter II, described a method to fight the character in the game. After other publications reprinted the details as fact without verifying the authenticity, the Sheng Long hoax spread worldwide. As a result of discussion revolving around the possibility of the character's appearance in Street Fighter III during the game's development, EGM revisited the <b>joke</b> <b>in</b> 1997, printing an updated version of the hoax for the title while establishing a backstory and appearance for the character in the process.|$|E

50|$|Fluency {{has been}} shown to affect judgements of humour. In one study, {{participants}} were presented with <b>jokes</b> which were <b>in</b> easy to read or hard to read fonts. Participants were asked to rate which jokes they believed were more humorous. Participants gave higher ratings to <b>jokes</b> <b>in</b> easy to read fonts. It has been predicted that the <b>jokes</b> <b>in</b> easy to read fonts feel fluent, as they are easier to pronounce and this results in higher ratings. The fluent processing has been misattributed to the humour of the statement.|$|R
