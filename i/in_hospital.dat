A mixed-method research approach was used to explore the extent of OSS adoption <b>in</b> <b>hospitals</b> {{as well as the}} factors facilitating and inhibiting adoption. The findings suggest a very limited adoption of OSS <b>in</b> <b>hospitals.</b> Hospitals tend to adopt general-purpose instead of domain-specific OSS. We found that software vendors are the critical factor facilitating the adoption of OSS <b>in</b> <b>hospitals.</b> Conversely, lack of in-house development, as well as a perceived lack of security, quality, and accountability of OSS products were factors inhibiting adoption. An empirical model is presented to illustrate the factors facilitating and inhibiting the adoption of OSS <b>in</b> <b>hospitals...</b>|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 97 - 106) The {{purpose of}} this project is to describe the essential characteristics of art programs for children <b>in</b> <b>hospitals.</b> Historically, concerns about the needs of hospitalized children began {{to emerge in the}} 1920 's with the development of the first play programs. Art programs <b>in</b> <b>hospitals</b> did not begin to occur until much later, in the early 1970 's. The importance of art for children in school and <b>in</b> the <b>hospital</b> is explored and provides a foundation for the development of art programs for children <b>in</b> <b>hospitals,</b> with emphasis ort the early childhood period of growth and development. A review of the literature reveals that art and play for the hospitalized child are of vital importance for his growth and development. However, art programs for children <b>in</b> <b>hospitals</b> are far and few between. Existing hospital art programs for children and adults in the United States and abroad are therefore an integral part of this project. The role and funding of the artist-in-residence is vital to the functioning of hospital arts programs. A collection of art projects which have been done with children <b>in</b> <b>hospitals</b> is included <b>in</b> the Appendix in the hopes that it will be useful to those working with children <b>in</b> <b>hospitals...</b>|$|R
