50|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, blood feuds marked by chains of revenge killings existed among Hedareb groups; unlike those among {{neighboring}} groups, they were rarely {{resolved by the}} payment of blood money, possibly due to the relative lack of Hedareb trading practices. Also distinctively, <b>killing</b> <b>one's</b> wife was traditionally punished by death, while <b>killing</b> <b>one's</b> children went unpunished. Rape of a noblewoman by a serf was punishable by death, while rape of serfs by nobles was tolerated.|$|R

5|$|Due to its slow motion, Beryl dropped heavy {{amounts of}} {{rainfall}}, peaking at 16.09inches (408mm) on Dauphin Island in Alabama. The rainfall caused some reports of flooding, while prolonged durations of rough waves resulted in severe beach erosion.

5|$|On 28 March 1913, a train {{leaving for}} High Wycombe {{collided}} with another arriving from Leicester, <b>killing</b> <b>one</b> passenger and injuring 23 {{people on the}} incoming train.

On Chichi-jima, Joan caused a boat to capsize, <b>killing</b> <b>one</b> of its occupants and leaving two others missing.|$|E
5|$|Some seamounts {{have not}} been mapped and thus pose a navigational danger. For instance, Muirfield Seamount is named after the ship that hit it in 1973.

5|$|Adams joined Franklin and Arthur Lee in 1778 as a {{commissioner}} to France, replacing Silas Deane.

Near {{the coast of}} Spain, Adams himself took up arms to help capture a heavily armed British merchantman ship, the Martha. Later, a cannon malfunction killed one and injured five more of the crew before the ship arrived in France.|$|E
40|$|I analyse the {{relationship}} between the Doctrine of Double Effect and the Trolley Problem: the former offers a solution for the latter only on the premise that <b>killing</b> the <b>one</b> in Bystander at the Switch is permissible. Here I offer both empirical and theoretical arguments against the permissibility of killing the one: firstly, I present data from my own empirical studies according to which the intuition that <b>killing</b> the <b>one</b> is permissible is neither widespread nor stable; secondly, I defend a normative principle according to which <b>killing</b> the <b>one</b> in Bystander at the Switch is not permissible. In conclusion, there just is no trolley problem...|$|R
5000|$|Biegenwald {{was also}} suspected, but never charged, {{in two other}} <b>killings.</b> <b>One</b> {{involved}} {{the shooting death of}} John Petrone, an ex-convict and sometime police informer, unearthed—minus his jawbone—on a remote New Jersey wildlife preserve. The other case involved Virginia Clayton, 17, abducted and killed on September 8, 1982, her body found three days later, four miles from the site where Petrone was buried.|$|R

5|$|After {{affecting}} Taiwan and China, Rammasun began weakening due to {{an approaching}} trough, which turned the typhoon northeastward. It passed over the Japanese island of Miyako-jima and also produced strong winds in Okinawa. About 10,000houses lost power on the island, and high surf killed two sailors. On the Japanese mainland, there was light crop damage and one serious injury. After weakening to a tropical storm, Rammasun passed {{just west of the}} South Korean island of Cheju-do, <b>killing</b> <b>one</b> person from high waves. The storm crossed the country, killing three others and leaving $9.5million in damage. High rains also affected North Korea and Primorsky Krai in the Russian Far East.|$|E
5|$|Al-Kharrat {{commenced}} guerrilla {{operations in}} September, targeting French forces posted {{in the eastern}} and southern Ghouta. His prominence rose as he led nighttime raids against the French in Damascus, during which he disarmed army patrols and took soldiers hostage. In al-Shaghour, Souk Saruja and Jazmatiyya, al-Kharrat and his band burnt down all French-held buildings. In {{the first week of}} October, sixty French gendarmes were dispatched to the Ghouta to apprehend al-Kharrat and his fighters. The gendarmes were quartered in the home of al-Malihah's mukhtar (village headman). In the evening, the rebels attacked the residence, <b>killing</b> <b>one</b> gendarme and capturing the rest; the prisoners were eventually all returned unharmed.|$|E
5|$|As {{the advance}} led by Gerhard Schöpfel {{made their way}} past the coast it spotted the vic-formation of RAF fighters. They were Hurricanes of 501 Squadron which were {{conducting}} wide spirals to gain height. Schöpfel bounced them and shot down four in two minutes <b>killing</b> <b>one</b> pilot and wounding three others. As he departed {{other members of his}} Geschwader (Wing) dived on the Squadron and an inconclusive dogfight ensued. Schöpfel's victims were Donald McKay and Pilot Officers J.W Bland, Kenneth Lee and F. Kozlowski. Bland was the only one killed.|$|E

50|$|In the Mahayana Buddhist text, the Amitāyurdhyāna Sūtra, Devadatta {{is said to}} have {{convinced}} Prince Ajātasattu to murder his father King Bimbisāra and ascend the throne. Ajātasattu follows the advice, and this action (another anantarika-kamma for <b>killing</b> <b>one's</b> own father) prevents him from attaining stream-entry at a later time, when listening to some teaching of the Buddha. This is confirmed by the Sāmaññaphalasutta of the Dīgha Nikāya (DN 2).|$|R
