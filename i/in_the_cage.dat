40|$|In {{this study}} it was {{investigated}} how laboratory rats use the space {{available to them}} in standard cages and if they spatially separate their behaviours. <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> effects of enlarging the floor surface area and of adding structure to <b>the</b> <b>cage</b> on <b>the</b> successful spatial separation of behaviours was studied. We performed differentiated investigations on <b>the</b> use of <b>cage</b> space in six different cage types, in which we analyzed the distribution of behaviours and objects on <b>the</b> <b>cage</b> floor. 18 female Wistar rats between 4 and 21 weeks of age were housed and examined in stable groups of three animals per <b>cage</b> type. <b>The</b> experiment was repeated three times, so that a total of 54 animals was used. <b>The</b> six <b>cage</b> types differed in floor and / or wall area. We used modified standard <b>cages</b> of <b>the</b> Macrolon® type III (about 800 cm²) and IV (about 1800 cm²) and a custom designed cage referred to as "type V" (3800 cm²). We also enriched cages of all three sizes with an opaque plastic dividing wall positioned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of <b>the</b> <b>cage.</b> Using video tapes and the picture analysing system "DOTFINDER", we determined the spatial distribution of the animals on <b>the</b> <b>cage</b> floor during <b>the</b> entire dark period (12 hours). Further, we determined the spatial distribution of ten defined behavioural patterns for individual animals by scoring selected 15 minute segments of video recordings (focal animal sampling, continuous recording), and using photographs we established the distribution of fecal pellets. In additional experiments we examined the spatial distribution of urine, cellulose paper and food pellets on <b>the</b> <b>cage</b> floor. <b>The</b> animals <b>in</b> all types of <b>cages</b> stayed near <b>the</b> walls, and especially in size IV and V cages they remained largely <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corners. The behavioural patterns "resting" "comfort behaviour", "exploration", "digging", "rearing", "play" and "other social behaviour" all primarily occured here. Only "locomotion" was distributed over <b>the</b> whole <b>cage</b> floor area. <b>The</b> majority of the dark period the animals stayed under <b>the</b> food hopper. <b>In</b> all <b>cage</b> types <b>the</b> fecal pellets, urine and food pellets were deposited pimarily near the walls. The most differentiated distribution of behaviours occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cages</b> of size V. Here, for example, the animals spatially separated the areas used for defecation from their main living areas. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>cages</b> of size III, <b>in</b> contrast, <b>the</b> animals {{did not succeed in}} separating most of the behavioural patterns. The areas where the most fecal pellets were found were identical to the main living and resting areas. <b>The</b> <b>cages</b> of size IV showed intermediate results. No areas used exclusively for resting were found in any <b>cage</b> type. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>cages</b> of size V the additional plastic dividing wall made the central area more usable, especially for depositing feces, urine and food pellets. For nearly all behaviours the rats preferred structured places (corners, walls, the niche under the food hopper). Thus, the animals showed which areas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cages</b> were usable to them and that structure is critical to their choice of location. The principle of performing behaviours in suitable places had priority over the principle of spatially separating different behaviours. Therefore, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cages</b> without sufficient suitable places, the animals were apparently forced to perform different behavioural patterns <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same location. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>cages</b> of <b>the</b> size V, particularly in cage type V with dividing wall, the animals probably had more suitable places available to them, due to the greater wall area, so that they were better able to spatially separate the different behaviours and were thereby able to achieve the best "specific space use". Using the successful spatial separation of different behaviours, especially of the main living and defecation areas, as <b>the</b> evaluation criterion, <b>cage</b> sizes III and IV appear to be inadequate. Through appropriate structuring of <b>the</b> <b>cage</b> floor area, however, {{it should be possible to}} increase the usable space for the animals and thereby to allow the spatial separation of behaviours even within a restricted cage space...|$|R

5|$|The {{main event}} steel cage match could be won only by {{climbing}} {{over the top}} of the cage all the way to the floor to win the match. Pinfalls and submission did not count, neither opponent could be disqualified, and the door to the cage would be locked for the entire match. As the cage lowered, Mike Tenay introduced the match and then handed the microphone over to AAA announcer Arturo Rivera to give the introductions in Spanish. Konnan came to the ring with both the IWC World Heavyweight Championship and the UWA Double Power Cup Championship that he had won from Perro Aguayo, although neither was on the line in the match. Once the door was locked, the two wrestlers began to brawl, with Aguayo trying to use Konnan as a ladder to climb out of the cage on more than one occasion. After a few minutes of fighting, Konnan dropped Aguayo face-first on the wire mesh cage, causing Aguayo to bleed (either by sheer impact or Aguayo secretly cutting himself to sell the brutality of the match). Once Aguayo started to bleed, Konnan began to focus on attacking Aguayo's forehead, including rubbing Aguayo's face across the cage. Moments later, both wrestlers found themselves on the top rope, fighting each other as they held on to the cage until Aguayo knocked Konnan off the top rope. Moments later, Aguayo attempted a pinfall even though the rules stated a pinfall did not matter. As the match progressed, sweat began to mix with his blood, causing his face to turn red. As Aguayo tried to climb out of the ring, Konnan leapt up with a low blow to keep his opponent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cage.</b> At that point, the cameras showed Eddie Guerrero and Madonna's Boyfriend watching the show from backstage, then moments later leaving the backstage area. As Aguayo climbed the cage, Los Gringos came to ringside and threw a cup of liquid in Aguayo's face. He then passed a set of brass knuckles to Konnan to use in the match. While at ringside, Guerrero got into a fistfight with several fans who were upset over his actions, forcing the security guards to step in and stop the fight. Following the assist by Los Gringos Locos, Konnan continued to attack Aguayo, with Aguayo ending up with his face and chest covered in blood from his head wound. At one point, Guerrero attacked the ringside referee, Pepe Casas, preventing him from stepping into the cage to check on Aguayo. When Konnan tried to escape, Los Hermanas Dinamita (Cien Caras, Máscara Año 2000, and Universo 2000) ran to ringside, attacking Guerrero and Madonna's Boyfriend at ringside. As Konnan straddled the cage, Cien Caras climbed up and knocked Konnan off the top and back inside the cage, allowing Aguayo to attack his opponent. Moments later, Aguayo dove off the top rope with a double stomp on Konnan and then climbed out of the cage to victory.|$|E

40|$|In {{these studies}} normal guinea pigs {{were exposed to}} tuberculous cage mates in two {{different}} degrees of crowding, some <b>in</b> ordinary <b>cages,</b> where <b>the</b> food became contaminated with the excreta, laden with tubercle bacilli, of the inoculated animals, and some in special cages with wire-mesh floors, where these excreta were largely excluded {{as a source of}} contagion. The results are summarized in Table V. In all these experiments crowding has always increased the incidence of <b>the</b> disease both <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ordinary and <b>the</b> special <b>cages.</b> However, due to the accident of eating of tuberculous animals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> more crowded <b>cages</b> these results are not conclusive, but they are <b>in</b> accord with <b>the</b> results of the previous study (2). It was found that the incidence of tuberculosis was lower among the guinea pigs exposed to contagion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> special <b>cages,</b> <b>in</b> which little of the contaminated excreta remained in direct contact with <b>the</b> normal animals. <b>In</b> fact <b>in</b> <b>the</b> less crowded special <b>cages</b> <b>the</b> incidence of tuberculosis was only a little higher than among the same total number of guinea pigs exposed at <b>the</b> same time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same room but not confined with tuberculous <b>cage</b> mates. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> special <b>cages,</b> especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> less crowded, where nearly all the contaminated excreta were removed, the disease acquired was largely respiratory in origin and was characterized by an extensive tuberculosis of the tracheobronchial lymph nodes with little or no affection of the mesenteric nodes. <b>The</b> pulmonary disease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> guinea pigs that acquired tuberculosis in these cages was more often extensive than that acquired <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ordinary <b>cages.</b> However no definite evidence of primary lesions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lung <b>in</b> <b>the</b> former was found, due to the dissemination of the disease at the time of death. The tuberculosis acquired by <b>the</b> contacts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ordinary <b>cages,</b> on <b>the</b> other hand, was usually enteric in origin, although both routes were involved, especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> less crowded <b>cages.</b> Moreover, a striking fact appears if we compare the course of tuberculosis in these two types of cages in both degrees of crowding: the contacts that developed tuberculosis <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ordinary <b>cages</b> survived an average of 106 and 114 days longer than <b>the</b> corresponding animals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> special <b>cages.</b> It is well known that the respiratory route is a far more dangerous avenue of infection <b>in</b> tuberculosis than <b>the</b> alimentary canal. This fact has again been clearly brought out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> recent studies of Bruno Lange and his associates (3), who have shown that although guinea pigs may occasionally be infected by way of the mouth with quantities as low as 0. 000, 001 mg. of virulent tubercle bacilli they often escape infection even when fed 0. 1 mg. or more. On the other hand if guinea pigs are made to inhale even the smallest quantities of tubercle bacilli they regularly contract tuberculosis. Furthermore they have also shown that the alimentary infection produces a disease far more chronic in character than that acquired by the respiratory route. It would therefore seem that the more acute type of disease is acquired <b>in</b> <b>the</b> special <b>cages</b> because <b>in</b> these <b>cages</b> <b>the</b> respiratory route plays by far the more important rô 1 e whereas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ordinary <b>cages</b> <b>the</b> disease is largely of enteric origin. However, it appears that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ordinary <b>cages</b> where <b>the</b> guinea pigs were constantly stirring up their sawdust or peat-moss bedding, laden with tubercle bacilli, there was an even greater opportunity for respiratory infection than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> special <b>cages</b> where there was no bedding at all and where most of the excreta were removed from immediate contact with the normal animals. That the respiratory mode of infection plays a rô 1 e even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ordinary <b>cages</b> was shown in a previous communication (2) as well as in this paper. In both studies it was found that only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> more crowded ordinary <b>cages</b> is <b>the</b> disease almost entirely of enteric origin but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> less crowded ordinary cages infection takes place by the respiratory tract as well, though to a smaller degree than by the alimentary. It would therefore appear that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ordinary <b>cages</b> both routes are open for infection but the relatively larger doses of tubercle bacilli ingested determine a disease of enteric origin and hence of a chronic nature, suppressing {{at the same time the}} engrafting of the disease by way of the lungs, and that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> special <b>cages</b> where <b>the</b> alimentary sources of infection have been reduced to a minimum, the disease is engrafted by way of the lungs and is therefore of more acute type. Although <b>in</b> <b>the</b> special <b>cages</b> <b>the</b> intensity of exposure even to tubercle bacilli entering by the respiratory tract is less than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ordinary <b>cages,</b> nevertheless <b>the</b> disease so produced is more acute, presumably because the inhibitory or retarding effect of enteric infection upon the development of respiratory disease is absent. This explains the paradoxical effect observed of a greater incidence and a more chronic type of disease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ordinary <b>cages</b> and a lower incidence and a more acute type of disease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> special <b>cages,</b> for <b>the</b> intensity of exposure by both routes is greater <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ordinary <b>cages,</b> and of <b>the</b> two, much greater by the enteric route...|$|R

Four others reflect Vance's world travels: Strange People, Queer Notions based on his stay in Positano, Italy; The Man <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cage,</b> based {{on a trip to}} Morocco; The Dark Ocean, set on a merchant marine vessel; and The Deadly Isles, based on a stay in Tahiti.|$|E
25|$|A female Asian golden cat at the Washington Park Zoo (now the Oregon Zoo) {{showed a}} {{dramatic}} increase in the frequency of scent marking during estrus. At the same time, she often rubbed her neck and head on inanimate objects. She also repeatedly approached the male <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cage,</b> rubbed on him, and adopted a receptive posture (lordosis) in front of him. The male's rate of scent marking increased during this time, as did his frequency of approaching and following the female. The male's mounting behavior included a nape bite, but in contrast to other small felids, the bite was not sustained.|$|E
25|$|The sixth {{season begins}} {{a year after}} the {{conclusion}} of the fifth season, with Dean living a somewhat happy life with Lisa and Ben. When an emotionless Sam returns to Dean, he is forced to leave his new life behind and work with his resurrected grandfather Samuel to capture Alpha monsters for Crowley. The brothers are unable to get much help from Castiel since his time is occupied by a civil war raging in heaven against the archangel Raphael. Dean does not trust Samuel and his suspicions are confirmed when he finds Samuel working with demons to discover the location of Purgatory. Dean discovers that Sam's soul is still <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cage,</b> so he implores the Horseman Death to retrieve it. To ensure Sam does not remember his time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cage,</b> as it may be too much for him to handle, Death blocks that part of Sam's memory using a mental wall. The season's second half revolves around the so-called Mother of All, which ultimately leads to events which prove that Castiel is behind the circumstances of Sam's return, the hunt for the Alpha monsters, and the search for Purgatory and was working with Crowley the entire time. When the brothers try to stop Castiel, he brings Sam's memory of the Cage back and proceeds with his plan, absorbing all the souls from Purgatory and pronouncing himself God, having ascended beyond a mere angel.|$|E
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to investigate {{the long-term effects of}} enhancing cage complexity on behavioural measures of welfare in laboratory rats. Wehoused 72 rats in groups of four in either ‘enriched’ or ‘unenriched’ cages for six weeks. Scan and focal animal sampling were conducted <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> light and dark phase of the second, fourth and sixth weeks. Results revealed that rats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ‘enriched’ <b>cages</b> showed longer durations of sleep behaviour, and low levels of agonistic behaviour compared to rats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ‘unenriched’ <b>cages.</b> Results importantly demonstrated that the behavioural changes observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> enriched environment were due to the presence of <b>the</b> enrichments themselves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cages</b> (indirect effects) and not due merely to rats interacting with <b>the</b> enrichment items <b>in</b> their environment. Thus, enhancing the complexity of conventional laboratory cages can promote behaviour such as longer bouts of sleep that is likely to be indicative of good welfare, and diminish levels of behaviour such as aggression that is likely to lead to poor welfare...|$|R
40|$|Metal-organic {{frameworks}} {{with open}} metal {{sites such as}} Cu-BTC {{have the potential to}} improve separations of molecules of differing polarities. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Cu-BTC structure, molecules with high dipole moment such as water are preferentially adsorbed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cages</b> containing <b>the</b> open metal sites, while less polar molecules such as alcohols can be adsorbed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other <b>cages.</b> We combine Monte Carlo simulations and ab initio calculations with the aim of tuning the adsorption properties of Cu-BTC (a) via selective blockage of cages or (b) poisoning the open metal centers. The simulation results propose selective blocking and screening of the active sites as good strategies to enhance <b>the</b> alcohol/water selectivity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gas and liquid phase as well as the water resistance of the structure...|$|R
2500|$|The {{growth of}} the cultured {{individuals}} can depend on the density of juveniles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cages</b> and <b>the</b> likely causes are competition for food and space. An initial density of 100 trochus m-2 achieves a basal diameter of 10-20mm [...] which can then be reduced to 50 trochus m-2 to yield basal diameters 25-40mm. [...] Beyond this range a density of less than 10 trochus m-2 is recommended.|$|R
