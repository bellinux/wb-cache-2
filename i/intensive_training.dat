5|$|By mid-1917, Haig was {{planning}} an offensive in the heavily defended Ypres region of Flanders. His plan involved {{a series of}} steps, {{the first of which}} was the capture of Messines Ridge by II ANZAC Corps. The New Zealand Division, already in the Messines sector, was given the task of capturing Messines Village and it began <b>intensive</b> <b>training</b> for the forthcoming battle under the close supervision of Russell. Extensive preparatory work was carried out, with transportation infrastructure laid down and ample supplies of shells brought forward for the artillery.|$|E

5|$|The RAAF's F-4Es entered {{service in}} September 1970, and {{proved to be}} highly effective. Used in the {{air-to-ground}} role, they prepared aircrew to operate the sophisticated F-111s, and the <b>intensive</b> <b>training</b> program undertaken using the aircraft improved the RAAF's professional standards. One of the Phantoms was destroyed in a flying accident in June 1971, and another was repaired by the RAAF after it sustained heavy damage during a crash landing. The 23 surviving aircraft were returned to the USAF in two batches during October 1972 and June 1973.|$|E
5|$|The {{divisions}} of I ANZAC Corps, now commanded by Lieutenant General William Birdwood with Godley taking over II ANZAC Corps, were initially {{based in the}} Armentières sector where they would undergo <b>intensive</b> <b>training</b> in trench warfare on the Western Front. The Armentières front line was regarded by the Allies as a nursery sector where new units could undergo familiarisation without being called upon for intensive offensive operations.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the command}} of Lieutenant Colonel Allan Wilder, who had served with the Wellington Mounted Rifles during the First World War, the {{battalion}} embarked for active service aboard the Cunard liner RMS Mauretania on 27 August 1940. After transferring to the Orient liner SS Ormonde at Bombay, the battalion arrived in the Middle East on 29 September and immediately commenced <b>intensive</b> <b>training</b> at Maadi Camp, the 2NZEF base {{near the town of}} Maadi, in Egypt.|$|E

5|$|According to BAE Systems, the Nimrod MRA4 systems was {{to enable}} the crews to gather, process and display up to 20 times more {{technical}} and strategic data than the MR2. The Searchwater 2000 radar was stated to have been capable over land as well as water; {{with the ability to}} have swept {{an area the size of}} the UK every 10 seconds. The Aircraft Synthetic Training Aids (ASTA) provided by Thales Training & Simulation was an electronic training suite to allow the training of crew members to transfer from active MRA4 aircraft to ground-based training systems; this change was made to increase the availability of the aircraft for operational missions and allow for more <b>intensive</b> <b>training</b> exercises.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham was {{promoted}} to flight lieutenant on 12 March 1940. In April 1940 the squadron flew as escort for a De Havilland Flamingo carrying Winston Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty, to Paris to attend a meeting after the German invasion of Denmark and Norway. Most of the unit's time during the Phoney War was consumed engaging in <b>intensive</b> <b>training</b> over the Wash which included co-operation with searchlights and mine-laying operations. It did not last for long. On 15 May 1940, 604 relocated to RAF Manston. From the airfield Cunningham flew sorties over the English Channel and patrols over Dunkirk as the Battle for France intensified. Cunningham made no recorded contact with the enemy and France capitulated on 25 June 1940.|$|E
5|$|In October, {{the unit}} moved from Tidworth to Colchester {{and around the}} same time it was redesignated as the 2/33rd Battalion, to bring it into line with the other battalions of the Second Australian Imperial Force. At Colchester, the Australians {{undertook}} a period of <b>intensive</b> <b>training</b> which was followed by defensive duties amidst the backdrop of the ongoing Battle of Britain, which took place in the skies overhead. During this time, the battalion was allocated the role of mobile reserve, assigned the task of counter-attacking around Harwich {{in the event of a}} German invasion; in this role they undertook further training operating with and against tanks, with British armoured vehicles and crews being assigned to the battalion during training exercises.|$|E

5|$|No.77 Squadron began re-equipping with North American P-51 Mustangs at Labuan in September 1945. In {{the wake}} of Japan's surrender, No.81 Wing became part of Australia's {{contribution}} to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF). No.77 Squadron {{was the last of}} the wing's three flying units to deploy to Japan, arriving at Bofu, a former kamikaze base, on 21March 1946. No.481 (Maintenance) Squadron provided technical service for the Mustangs. Occupation duties proved uneventful, the main operational task being surveillance patrols, but units maintained an <b>intensive</b> <b>training</b> regime and undertook combined exercises with other Allied forces. Many RAAF personnel were accompanied to Japan by their families.|$|E
5|$|Unicorn was {{assigned}} to Force V, a flotilla of British carriers, commanded by Admiral Philip Vian, intended to provide air cover to Operation Avalanche, the Allied landings at Salerno. In preparation for this mission, the ship disembarked all of her Swordfish, except for a small detachment of three from 818 Squadron for self-defence, and the Sea Hurricanes of 800 Squadron. They were replaced by Seafires of 809 and 897 Squadrons. Each of the Seafire squadrons had 10 aircraft, {{for a total of}} 33. Unicorn joined the escort carriers of Force V in August at Gibraltar before they moved forward to the Central Mediterranean for <b>intensive</b> <b>training</b> prior to the commencement of the amphibious landing on 9 September.|$|E
5|$|After sea trials, Tirpitz was {{stationed}} in Kiel and performed <b>intensive</b> <b>training</b> in the Baltic. While the ship was in Kiel, Germany invaded the Soviet Union. A temporary Baltic Fleet was created to prevent the possible break-out of the Soviet fleet based in Leningrad. Tirpitz was briefly made the flagship of the squadron, which consisted of the heavy cruiser , the light cruisers , , , and , several destroyers, and two flotillas of minesweepers. The Baltic Fleet, {{under the command of}} Vice Admiral Otto Ciliax, patrolled off the Aaland Islands from 23 to 26 September 1941, after which the unit was disbanded and Tirpitz resumed training. During the training period, Tirpitz tested her primary and secondary guns on the old pre-dreadnought battleship , which had been converted into a radio-controlled target ship. The British Royal Air Force (RAF) continued to launch unsuccessful bombing raids on Tirpitz while she {{was stationed}} in Kiel.|$|E

The construction {{of some of these}} lines was only completed on 2 June 1890, delaying the implementation of a full express train service over the bridge until that date. Even then, there was considerable congestion at Edinburgh Waverley station with remarshalling of the portions of the new, more <b>intensive</b> <b>train</b> service.|$|R

The same year, van Hamel, McKenzie, Gregory Cary, and Bentley Roton founded the Kaatsbaan International Dance Center as a {{facility}} to host national and international artists. There van Hamel has been the Program Director of Extreme Ballet, a three-week <b>intensive</b> <b>training</b> program, {{since its inception in}} 1991. In 1992, Washington College presented her with the Award for Excellence for her contributions in the arts. Van Hamel left Nederlands Dans Theater III in 1997 and worked as choreographer and director. She returned to ABT in 2004 to teach at the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis School and to occasionally perform character roles with the professional dance company. She joined the faculty at the Juilliard School in the same year.|$|E
5|$|Browning {{supervised}} {{the newly formed}} division as it underwent a prolonged period of expansion and <b>intensive</b> <b>training,</b> with new brigades raised and assigned to the division, and new equipment tested. Though not considered an airborne warfare visionary, he proved adept at dealing with an apathetic War Office and an obstructionist Air Ministry, and demonstrated a knack for overcoming bureaucratic obstacles. As the airborne forces expanded in size, the major difficulty in getting the 1st Airborne Division ready for operations was a shortage of aircraft. The Royal Air Force had neglected air transport before the war, and the only available aircraft for airborne troops were conversions of obsolete bombers like the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley. Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris in particular felt that the 1st Airborne Division was not worth the drain on Bomber Command's resources.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Bankhead was {{replaced}} by Lieutenant Colonel William S. Harney in 1839. Colonel Harney had two earlier encounters with Seminoles, the first a battle in which Chief Arpeika eluded capture, and a second in which Harney escaped in only his shirt and drawers from an early morning attack (the Harney Massacre) on his camp led by Chief Chakaika. In light of these experiences, Harney instituted an <b>intensive</b> <b>training</b> program in swamp and jungle warfare for his men. After Chakaika led the raid on Indian Key in August 1840, Harney set out into the Everglades after Chakaika, and killed him in his own camp. The war quieted down after that, with active pursuit of the Seminoles ending in 1842, {{although some of the}} Seminoles remained hidden in the Everglades.|$|E
