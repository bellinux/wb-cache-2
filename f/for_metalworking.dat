5|$|Most zircon is used {{directly}} in commercial applications, {{but a small}} percentage is converted to the metal. Most Zr metal is produced by {{the reduction of the}} zirconium(IV) chloride with magnesium metal in the Kroll process.

5|$|Tantalum is {{also used}} to produce a variety of alloys that have high melting points, strength, and ductility. Alloyed with other metals, it {{is also used}} in making carbide tools <b>for</b> <b>metalworking</b> {{equipment}} and in the production of superalloys for jet engine components, chemical process equipment, nuclear reactors, and missile parts. Because of its ductility, tantalum can be drawn into fine wires or filaments, which are used for evaporating metals such as aluminium. Since it resists attack by body fluids and is nonirritating, tantalum is widely used in making surgical instruments and implants. For example, porous tantalum coatings are used in the construction of orthopedic implants due to tantalum's ability to form a direct bond to hard tissue.|$|E

Depending on context and on which type of cutting fluid is being considered, it may be referred to as cutting fluid, cutting oil, cutting compound, coolant, or lubricant.|$|E
2500|$|Born in Sans Souci, Trinidad, Mannette as a {{young child}} {{developed}} a passion for metal and tools <b>for</b> <b>metalworking,</b> and would become engaged {{in the evolution of the}} phenomenon of sounding steel. At the age of 11, he was a member of Alexander's Ragtime Band created by Alexander Ford. From the middle of the 1930's, percussion bands of different quarters of Port-of-Spain were in competition with each other. Legend says that Mannette was the first person to use a discarded oil barrel to build a steel pan: [...] "He sank the lid to create a tensed playing surface and fired the metal to improve the acoustic properties." [...] From about 1939 to 1941, he performed with his own band, the Oval Boys (the name taken from the oval sports pavilion opposite the band's rehearsal space).|$|E
