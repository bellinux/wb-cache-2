Introduction. – A critical stress threshold is often defined to characterize material resistance to rupture. When the applied stress is smaller than the threshold, experiments show that rupture can still occur after a delay in time which decreases with the applied stress and with temperature [1 – 3]. A widespread approach has been to relate time-dependent fracture to the creep properties of the material [4, 5]. In this general framework, the creep law is a...|$|E

40|$|Communication 4271 [URL] are {{interested}} in slow rupture processes observed when a material is submitted to a constant load below a critical rupture threshold. It {{is well known that}} the delay time (or lifetime) of the material before complete macroscopic rupture strongly depends on the applied stress. Thermodynamics has slowly emerged as a possible framework to describe delayed rupture of materials since early experiments have shown temperature dependence of lifetime with an Arrhenius law. On the other hand, efforts are made to describe slow rupture dynamics from rheological properties of the material such as viscoelasticity and plasticity. To shed light on this problem, it is important to compare experiments and models to distinguish between the different theoretical descriptions. For this purpose, we have studied experimentally the slow growth of a single crack in a fibrous material made of <b>fax</b> <b>paper.</b> Specifically, we have observed that the crack grows by steps of various sizes whose distribution is rather complex and evolves {{as a function of the}} crack length. In spite of this complexity, a statistical average of the growth dynamics reveals a very simple behaviour. We show that a model of thermally activated dynamics is able to reproduce many experimental observations. In particular, we show that the average dynamics is in good agreement with the experimental data. In addition, we find that the distribution of step sizes follows sub-critical point statistics with a power law and a stress-dependent exponential cut-off diverging at the critical rupture threshold. The exponent of the power law predicted by the model (3 / 2) seems to be slightly too large. Leaving the exponent as a free parameter gives a value 1. 23 +/- 0. 1. We stress that the material heterogeneity appears in the model only as a characteristic mesoscopic length scale. The fact that a simple model of thermally activated crack dynamics is able to reproduce with a good accuracy our experimental findings may open new perspectives in the description of slow rupture dynamics...|$|E

40|$|The {{motivation}} {{for research on}} low-quality images comes from a requirement by some museums to respond to queries for pictorial information, submitted {{in the form of}} fax messages or other low-quality monochrome images of works of art. The museums have databases of high-resolution images of their artefact collections and the person submitting the query is asking typically whether the museum holds the artwork shown or perhaps some similar work. Often the query image will have no associated metadata and will be produced from a low-resolution picture of the original artwork. The resulting poor quality image, received by the museum, leads to very poor retrieval accuracy when the fax is used in standard query by example searches using, for example, colour, spatial colour or texture matching algorithms. We propose a special retrieval algorithm in order to improve the retrieval accuracy in query by low-quality image application and evaluate it in comparison with more conventional algorithms.

The frequencies are split into time-intervals. The goal is to send a given number of signals as quickly as possible through the station given a priority of each signal. Signals with high priority should be sent first, while other signals can wait a while without the delay causing problems (like phonecall versus <b>fax).</b> In this <b>paper,</b> we study a linear programming model of this problem.

40|$|Crude oil {{constitutes}} {{a large percentage}} of the Nigerian economy. The activities associated with crude oil production involve exploration, drilling, and transportation. Of these activities drilling is known to be the most arduous and expensive venture. The drilling sites are often remote, harsh, hostile, oppressive areas and lack necessary communication infrastructure. The terrestrial infrastructure in Nigeria is often insufficient, antiquated, or non-existent. The dearth of efficient telecommunications facilities therefore poses a serious problem to the oil companies. Since drilling, exploration, and production of oil and gas have expanded in Nigeria, oil companies [4] have been seeking innovative, efficient, and cost-effective telecommunication solutions to carryout these activities safely and economically. Over the years, a majority of oil companies in remote oil locations in the Eastern and Western Delta areas of Nigeria are getting on with only an analogue phone line and a thermal <b>paper</b> <b>fax</b> machine.

40|$|Background: The study {{objectives}} were {{to describe the}} incidence {{and the nature of}} patient safety incidents (PSIs) in primary care general practice settings, and to explore the association between these incidents and practice or organizational characteristics. Methods: GPs, randomly selected from a national influenza surveillance network (n = 800) across France, prospectively reported any incidents observed each day over a one-week period between May and July 2013. An incident was an event or circumstance that could have resulted, or did result, in harm to a patient, which the GP would not wish to recur. Primary outcome was the incidence of PSIs which was determined by counting reports per total number of patient encounters. Reports were categorized using existing taxonomies. The association with practice and organizational characteristics was calculated using a negative binomial regression model. Results: 127 GPs (participation rate 79 %) reported 317 incidents of which 270 were deemed to be a posteriori judged preventable, among 12, 348 encounters. 77 % had no consequences for the patient. The incidence of reported PSIs was 26 per 1000 patient encounters per week (95 % CI [23 ‰ - 28 ‰]). Incidents were three times more frequently related to the organization of healthcare than to knowledge and skills of health professionals, and especially to the workflow in the GPs’ offices and to the communication between providers and with patients. Among GP characteristics, three were related with an increased incidence in the final multivariable model: length of consultation higher than 15 minutes, method of receiving radiological results (by <b>fax</b> compared to <b>paper</b> or email), and being in a multidisciplinary clinic compared with sole practitioners. Conclusions: Patient safety incidents (PSIs) occurred in mean once every two days in the sampled GPs and 2 % of them were associated with a definite possibility for harm. Studying the association between organizational features of general practices and PSIs remains a major challenge {{and one of the most}} important issues for safety in primary care. 14 page(s...|$|R
