5|$|Adult dusky sharks have a {{broad and}} varied diet, {{consisting}} mostly of bony fishes, sharks and rays, and cephalopods, but also occasionally crustaceans, sea stars, bryozoans, sea turtles, marine mammals, carrion, and garbage. This species is viviparous with a three-year reproductive cycle; females bear litters of 314 young after a gestation period of 2224 months, after which there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> of rest before they become pregnant again. Females are capable of storing sperm for long periods, as their encounters with suitable mates may be {{few and far between}} due to their nomadic lifestyle and low overall abundance. Dusky sharks are one of the slowest-growing and latest-maturing sharks, not reaching adulthood until around 20 years of age.|$|E
5|$|Narayan's wife Sheela, a homemaker, came to Mumbai in the 1950s {{and they}} had four children. She died prior to 2001. His oldest son, sarod player Brij Narayan, was born on 25 April 1952 in Udaipur, and his {{daughter}} Aruna Narayan was born in 1959 in Mumbai.

Another son, Shiv, who <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> younger than Aruna, has learned to play the tabla, and toured Australia with his father. Brij Narayan's son, Harsh Narayan, plays the sarangi. In 2009, Narayan performed at BBC's The Proms in the Royal Albert Hall, London, with Aruna, and he played at the 2010 Sawai Gandharva Music Festival, Pune, with Harsh.|$|E
5|$|The meerkat Flower is {{born in the}} Kalahari Desert on March 15, 2000, to Holly, {{the leader}} of a meerkat group called the Whiskers. After an attack by a rival group, the Lazuli, the Whiskers are forced to {{surrender}} their territory and move to a new home. A hawk kills Holly when Flower <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> old, and her father abandons the group to find a new mate. Flower's sister Viale becomes the group's matriarch and chooses Youssarian, a roving male from the Lazuli, as her mate. Flower mates with Yossarian's brother, Zaphod, but Viale kills the resulting pups and banishes Flower from the group, allowing her to return later. During a time of starvation and drought, Viale attempts to lead the group across a road to forage. As she crosses, she is struck and killed by a passing truck. As the Whiskers attempt to adjust to the loss of their leader, a snake approaches the group. Flower steps in to lead an attack to drive it off. In doing so, she becomes the new leader of the group. Zaphod returns to the group to be her mate, while Yossarian steps aside and leaves the group. Flower leads the Whiskers back to their original home, and after a brief battle, the Whiskers reclaim it from the Lazuli. At end of the film, an on-screen note describes Flower's death during the third season of Meerkat Manor and the children she left behind.|$|E

25|$|The highest attested yeardate for Siamun <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Year</b> 17 {{the first}} month of Shemu day , {{mentioned}} in fragment 3B, lines 3-5 from the Karnak Priestly Annals. It records the induction of Hori, son of Nespaneferhor into the Priesthood at Karnak. This date was a lunar Tepi Shemu feast day. Based on the calculation of this lunar Tepi Shemu feast, Year 17 of Siamun has been shown by the German Egyptologist Rolf Krauss to be equivalent to 970 BC. Hence, Siamun would have taken the throne about 16 years earlier in 986 BC. A stela dated to Siamun's Year 16 records a land-sale between some minor priests of Ptah at Memphis.|$|E

25|$|After the {{bachelor}} courses, students {{are allowed to}} enter the 'master in medicine' courses, which consist of 4 years of theoretical and clinical study. In general, the first 2 master years are very theoretical and teach the students in human pathology, diseases, pharmacology. The third year <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> full of internships {{in a wide range}} of specialities in different clinics. The seventh, final year serves as a kind of 'pre-specialization' year in which the students are specifically trained in the specialty they wish to pursue after medical school. This contrasts with the Dutch approach, in which graduates are literally 'basic doctors' (basisartsen) who have yet to decide on a specialty.|$|E
25|$|The {{usage of}} names {{is governed by}} strict norms in {{traditional}} Korean society. It is generally considered rude to address people by their given names in Korean culture. This is particularly the case when dealing with adults or one's elders. It is acceptable to call someone {{by his or her}} given name {{if he or she is}} the same age as the speaker. However, it is considered rude to use someone's given name if that person's age <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> older than the speaker.

25|$|Scarce {{information}} on Kim Jong-un's early life comes from North Korean defectors {{and people who}} have claimed to witness him abroad, such as during his school attendance in Switzerland. Some of the information has been conflicting and contradictory, perhaps confusing him with his brother, Kim Jong-chul, who also attended school in Switzerland around the same time. Nevertheless, there has been some consensus on information about his early life. North Korean authorities have stated that his birthdate is 8 January 1982, but South Korean intelligence officials believe the actual date <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> later. Former basketball star Dennis Rodman said that the birthdate is 8 January 1983 after meeting Kim in September 2013 in North Korea.

500|$|The breed is {{predisposed}} to conditions {{found in many}} breeds, such as abdominal hernias. Westie puppies may be affected by craniomandibular osteopathy, a disease also known as [...] "lion jaw", and is sometimes {{also referred to as}} [...] "westie jaw". The disease is an autosomal recessive condition, so a puppy can only be affected by it if both its parents are carriers of the faulty gene. The condition appears across many breeds, including several different types of terriers, as well as other unrelated breeds such as the Great Dane. It typically appears in dogs under a year old, and can cause problems for the dog to chew or swallow food. Radiographic testing can be conducted to diagnose the condition, in which the bones around the jaw thicken; additionally, the blood may show increased calcium levels and enzyme levels. The condition often stops progressing by the time the dog <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> old, and in some cases can recede. It is normally treated with anti-inflammatory medications, and the feeding of soft foods. In some cases, tube feeding may be necessary. However, if the animal still cannot eat and is in uncontrolled pain, then euthanasia may be the only medical option remaining.|$|E

2500|$|The {{breeding}} {{of the southern}} hairy-nosed wombat occurs when their favoured food is at its peak growth rates. Their reproduction relies on the winter rainfall, which germinates the grasses. Between August and October, when rainfall is sufficient, females enter ovulation and the males' testosterone levels and prostate gland sizes increase. In years of low rainfall, neither occurs. When breeding, dominance hierarchies among males are established through aggression. Copulation {{takes place in the}} warren, with males remaining in one burrow and females moving among them. Mating takes place underground and involves the male mounting the female from behind while she is on her side. The gestation period of the wombat lasts 22days and most births occur in October. When a young is born, it climbs into the pouch and clings to a teat. It stays in the pouch for six months growing to around 0.45kg, with a light pelage and open eyes. [...] It soon leaves the pouch and starts grazing at the surface. The young is fully weaned when it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> old and reaches full size at the age of three years, which is also when it becomes sexually mature.|$|E
