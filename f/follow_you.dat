5|$|Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman {{intended}} to <b>follow</b> <b>You</b> Only Live Twice with The Man with the Golden Gun, inviting Roger Moore to the Bond role. However, filming was planned in Cambodia, and the Samlaut Uprising made filming impractical, {{leading to the}} production being cancelled. On Her Majesty's Secret Service was produced instead with George Lazenby as Bond. Lazenby's next Bond film, Saltzman told a reporter, would be either The Man with the Golden Gun or Diamonds Are Forever. The producers chose the latter title, with Sean Connery returning as Bond.|$|E

500|$|Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four, {{calling it a}} disappointment. Vitaris heavily criticized Mulder's line: [...] "I'm not a psychologist"—reportedly an ad lib from Duchovny himself—noting that it {{undermines}} established continuity within the series including the character's background in psychology. Tom Kessenich, in his 2002 book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files, praises the installment, saying, [...] "Place a devil in the plot and I'll <b>follow</b> <b>you</b> {{to see what you}} can cook up.... I enjoyed this tale of a devil looking to be just a normal dad immensely." [...] In his view the episode showed a return to the earlier horror-based narratives the series was known for; though he praises the casting of Campbell, he writes that moments between Mulder and Scully are lacking.|$|E
