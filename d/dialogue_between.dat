5|$|Her {{philosophical}} views {{also find}} {{mention in the}} Chandogya Upanishad. Gargi, as Brahmavadini, composed several hymns in Rigveda (in X 39. V.28) that questioned the origin of all existence. The Yoga Yajnavalkya, a classical text on Yoga is a <b>dialogue</b> <b>between</b> Gargi and sage Yajnavalkya. Gargi was honoured {{as one of the}} Navaratnas (nine gems) in the court of King Janaka of Mithila.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Jeunet {{included}} an alternate {{version of the}} film on the Alien Quadrilogy DVD box set with different opening and closing credits, which were originally cut due to budget restrictions. The deleted scenes included references to the character Newt from Aliens, Vriess making a joke to Call, Ripley's clone {{waking up in the}} middle of her operation, an extended conversation in the mess hall that reveals the details of Ripley's former employers, Weyland-Yutani, an extended <b>dialogue</b> <b>between</b> Call and Ripley's clone in the chapel and scenes of the Betty landing on Earth and the planet's landscape during the final <b>dialogue</b> <b>between</b> Ripley and Call, as they view the ruins of Paris. The special edition restores 13 minutes and 5 seconds worth of footage (including the new opening and ending), and is 7 minutes longer than theatrical version. Jeunet has stated that the special edition is not a director's cut as his preferred version is the theatrical cut.|$|E
5|$|Krishna Gitavali or Krishnavali (कृष्णगीतावली, 1607), {{literally}} Collection of Songs to Krishna, is {{a collection}} of 61 songs in honour of Krishna in Braja. There are 32 songs devoted to the childhood sports (Balalila) and Rasa Lila of Krishna, 27 songs form the <b>dialogue</b> <b>between</b> Krishna and Uddhava, and two songs describe the episode of disrobing of Draupadi.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the best}} {{received}} puzzles in the game involves arranging the pieces of a <b>dialogue</b> <b>between</b> the sculpted heads of Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein. The player listens to the randomly ordered statements made by each head, then decides how to chronologically arrange the statements to form a coherent conversation based on context.|$|E
5|$|Simultaneously, {{a nearby}} Army {{reconnaissance}} team conducted a failed {{assault on the}} town {{on the basis that}} the audibly nearby Naval forces—which they did not know were then in retreat—would bring support. The outcome left the Union forces with a combined 5 casualties and 21 wounded. <b>Dialogue</b> <b>between</b> officers following the conflict left the Union navy questioning the usefulness of gunboats in joint expedition settings in which they would not be capable of supporting themselves.|$|E
5|$|Steins;Gates {{gameplay}} requires little interaction {{from the}} player {{as most of}} the duration of the game is spent on reading the text that appears on the screen which represents either the <b>dialogue</b> <b>between</b> the various characters or the thoughts of the protagonist.

5|$|The <b>dialogue</b> <b>between</b> Sharon and Randy {{that would}} provoke {{significant}} attention was not scripted until Tuesday morning, less than 48 hours prior to broadcast, {{and was one}} of the last completed parts of the show. Parker likened the scene to an afterthought, as he felt it was not necessarily central to the episode's story.|$|E
5|$|According to Taum, {{the title}} Belenggu {{reflects}} the inner conflicts {{the main characters}} face that limit their actions. Taum points to {{the climax of the}} novel– in which Rohayah refuses to marry Sukartono because if she were to marry him he would lose face because of her past– as a prime example of these limitations. Siregar notes that such a reading is supported by <b>dialogue</b> <b>between</b> Hartono and Sukartono, in which they note that humans are inherently held back by their reminiscences of the past.|$|E
5|$|Article 17 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) {{lays the}} {{juridical}} foundation for an open, transparent <b>dialogue</b> <b>between</b> European institutions and churches, religious associations, and non-confessional and philosophical organisations. In July 2014, {{in the beginning}} of the 8th term, then President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz tasked Antonio Tajani, then Vice-president, with implementing the dialogue with the religious and confessional organisations included in article 17. In this framework, the European Parliament hosts high-level conferences on inter-religious dialogue, also with focus on current issues and in relation with parliamentary works.|$|E

5|$|Central to the 2009 dispute was the {{agreement}} that ended the 2007 round of strikes. The 2007 Pay and Modernisation Agreement saw the parties involved agree to a four-phase plan, which would be implemented with <b>dialogue</b> <b>between</b> both sides at each stage of the process. However, the Communication Workers Union said that although Royal Mail had carried out three of the phases in this way, it had refused to discuss the final phase, which concerned the government's plans for modernisation, and how these would affect the job security of Royal Mail employees.|$|E
5|$|Critics who {{admire his}} middle work might {{characterize}} it as supple and muscular in its rhythms and sometimes harshly modernist, while others find these poems barren and weak in imaginative power. Yeats's later work found new imaginative inspiration in the mystical system {{he began to}} work out for himself {{under the influence of}} spiritualism. In many ways, this poetry is a return to the vision of his earlier work. The opposition between the worldly minded man of the sword and the spiritually minded man of God, the theme of The Wanderings of Oisin, is reproduced in A <b>Dialogue</b> <b>Between</b> Self and Soul.|$|E
5|$|He helped {{establish}} the Academy's Science and Industry Forum, which {{was formed in}} the second year of his leadership in order to improve <b>dialogue</b> <b>between</b> researchers and industrialists. It investigated whether a national science policy should be formulated and led to the eventual creation of the Australian Science and Technology Council. He also laid the foundations of the Australian Biological Resources Study. When his presidency ended in 1969, the Academy founded the Burnet Lecture and Medal, which is the Academy's highest award for biological sciences.|$|E

5|$|Several further {{instances}} {{have been}} expounded by critics. Taum notes that Yah's guilt over her {{past as a}} prostitute leads her to the (unfounded) fear that Tono would leave her if their relationship were known; her guilt ultimately causes their separation, while Tono feels nostalgic for the past, in which he felt happier. Balfas notes that a factor driving Tono from Tini is the latter's former relationship with Hartono; due to her guilt over the affair, she is unable to express her love for the doctor. Siregar writes that such a theme is reflected in <b>dialogue</b> <b>between</b> Tono and Hartono, from which he suggests the novel derives its title. Balfas writes {{that there is no}} solution to the human problems presented in the novel.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{period for}} parties and candidates began on 11 March and continued until 1 April. It was {{split into two}} phases by Nyepi, the Balinese day of silence. Parties delivered their national agendas indoors between 11 and 25 March. Although this was meant to encourage <b>dialogue</b> <b>between</b> parties and their constituents, these events were poorly attended. The International Foundation for Electoral Systems conducted a tracking survey that showed not all voters knew how to vote for candidates of the new DPD, or were even aware it existed.|$|E
5|$|The cantata text {{does not}} tell a story but {{reflects}} {{different aspects of the}} Holy Spirit, celebrated on Pentecost. It begins with general praise, then concentrates on one line from the Gospel, addresses the Holy Trinity, refers to the Spirit that was present at the Creation, shows a <b>dialogue</b> <b>between</b> the Soul and the Spirit, and concludes with a stanza from Nicolai's hymn which picks up the topic of unity between God (Spirit) and man, as shown in the dialogue. The text thus proceeds from general to more and more personal and intimate reflection.|$|E

5|$|The finale is in sonata form. It {{features}} significant {{developments of}} a simple motif, and considerable <b>dialogue</b> <b>between</b> the four parts. The finale also contains {{a high degree of}} chromaticism, a feature that links the four movements of the work. The musicologist W. Dean Sutcliffe points to the recurrence of C at key points in each movement, serving at different times to create dissonance, to commence modulation (music) away from the tonic, or, {{as in the case of}} the finale, as a device for inflection.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} requires little interaction {{from the}} player {{as most of}} the duration of the game is spent simply reading the text that appears on the screen which represents either <b>dialogue</b> <b>between</b> the various characters or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. The player has a chance to assume the role of four protagonists, two in each Ef: The First Tale and Ef: The Latter Tale. Each protagonist is paired with a heroine, and each scenario in the original PC versions of the visual novels includes scenes with sexual content. These scenes are removed or modified in the PlayStation 2 port.|$|E
5|$|The {{philosophy}} {{and principles of}} Tulsidas are found across his works, and are especially outlined in the <b>dialogue</b> <b>between</b> Kakbhushundi and Garuda in the Uttar Kand of the Ramcharitmanas. Tulsidas' doctrine {{has been described as}} an assimilation and reconciliation of the diverse tenets and cultures of Hinduism. At the beginning of the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas says that his work is in accordance with various scriptures – the Puranas, Vedas, Upavedas, Tantra and Smriti. Ram Chandra Shukla in his critical work Hindi Sahitya Ka Itihaas elaborates on Tulsidas' Lokmangal as the doctrine for social upliftment which made this great poet immortal and comparable to any other world littérateur.|$|E
