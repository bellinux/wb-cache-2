2500|$|The combat {{systems from}} Saints Row have been updated {{but many of}} the basics remain unchanged. While {{engaging}} in melee-based combat, the player character will perform combos and charge up attacks, and can execute a finishing move if three consecutive hits are dealt. With a gun equipped, the player can perform a groin attack, and can zoom in for a finer aim reticle. The player can also employ the use of human shields, and can use makeshift weapons pulled from the environment e.g. fire hydrants, cement blocks. Should the player either commit illegal activities or incite rival gang members, they will provoke potentially fatal attention from authoritative figures or rival gangs. The notoriety bar is a visual representation of the proactivity of the opposing figures' response and continual inciting of these groups will bring about a more powerful response, such as SWAT teams from the police. The player will continue to be chased by these groups until captured or killed and must reduce the notoriety bar by either hiding from the police or gang and wait for it to [...] "cool off", or by seeking out a drive-through confessional which will clear the notoriety bar for a small fee. Should the player character be apprehended or killed, {{a small percentage of the}} player's <b>earnings</b> <b>will</b> be removed and the player will respawn at law or healthcare institutions. The game contains over forty different weapons, many of which have been recycled from Saints Row. The game allows the player to utilise new weapon types, examples of which include satchel charges, laser-guided rocket launchers, chainsaws and more. The player has the ability to dual wield handguns and submachine guns. Weaponry can be purchased by the player from specific stores or unlocked throughout in-game progress.|$|E

Opponents argue that <b>earnings</b> quality <b>will</b> decline. We examine whether the level of required book-tax conformity affects earnings persistence and the association between earnings and future cash flows.

Our evidence suggests that increased book-tax conformity may reduce earnings quality. Book-tax conformity Book-tax differences Usefulness of earnings Earnings persistence Future cash flows...|$|R
6000|$|The Perkins Institution and Massachusetts Asylum for the Blind, at Boston, is superintended by {{a body of}} {{trustees}} who make an annual report to the corporation. The indigent blind of that state are admitted gratuitously. Those from the adjoining state of Connecticut, or from the states of Maine, Vermont, or New Hampshire, are admitted by a warrant from the state to which they respectively belong; or, failing that, must find security among their friends, for the payment of about twenty pounds English for their first year's board and instruction, and ten for the second. [...] 'After the first year,' say the trustees, 'an account current will be opened with each pupil; he will be charged with the actual cost of his board, which will not exceed two dollars per week;' a trifle more than eight shillings English; 'and he will be credited with the amount paid for him by the state, or by his friends; also with his earnings {{over and above the}} cost of the stock which he uses; so that all his earnings over one dollar per week will be his own.

60|$|Frank Greystock, {{the writer}} fears, {{will not have}} {{recommended}} himself to those readers of this tale who think the part of lover to the heroine should be always filled by {{a young man with}} heroic attributes. And yet the young member for Bobsborough was by no means deficient in fine qualities, and perhaps was quite as capable of heroism as the majority of barristers and members of Parliament among whom he consorted, and who were to him--the world. A man born to great wealth may,--without injury to himself or friends,--do pretty nearly what he likes in regard to marriage, always presuming that the wife he selects be of his own rank. He need not marry for money, nor need he abstain from marriage because he can't support a wife without money. And the very poor man, who has no pretension to rank or standing, other than that which honesty may give him, can do the same. His wife's fortune will consist in the labour of her hands, and in her ability to assist him in his home. But between these there is a middle class of men, who, by reason of their education, are peculiarly susceptible to the charms of womanhood, but who literally cannot marry for love, because their <b>earnings</b> <b>will</b> do no more than support themselves. As to this special young man, it must be confessed that his earnings should have done much more than that; but not the less did he find himself in a position in which marriage with a penniless girl seemed to threaten him and her with ruin. All his friends told Frank Greystock that he would be ruined were he to marry Lucy Morris;--and his friends were people supposed to be very good and wise. The dean, and the dean's wife, his father and mother, were very clear that it would be so. Old Lady Linlithgow had spoken of such a marriage as quite out of the question. The Bishop of Bobsborough, when it was mentioned in his hearing, had declared that such a marriage would be a thousand pities. And even dear old Lady Fawn, though she wished it for Lucy's sake, had many times prophesied that such a thing was quite impossible. When the rumour of the marriage reached Lady Glencora, Lady Glencora told her friend, Madame Max Goesler, that that young man was going to blow his brains out. To her thinking, the two actions were equivalent. It is only when we read of such men that we feel that truth to his sweetheart is the first duty of man. I am afraid {{that it is not the}} advice which we give to our sons.|$|E

50|$|The 1982 SEC rule 10b-18 allowed public {{companies}} open-market repurchases {{of their own}} stock and {{made it easier to}} manipulate capital structure. This hypothesis leads to a larger number of testable predictions. First, it has been deducted that market average <b>earnings</b> yield <b>will</b> be in equilibrium with the market average interest rate on corporate bonds after corporate taxes, which is a reformulation of the 'Fed model'. The second prediction has been that companies with a high valuation ratio, or low <b>earnings</b> yield, <b>will</b> have little or no debt, whereas companies with low valuation ratios will be more leveraged. When companies have a dynamic debt-equity target, this explains why some companies use dividends and others do not. A fourth prediction has been that there is a negative relationship in the market between companies' relative price volatilities and their leverage. This contradicts Hamada who used the work of Modigliani and Miller to derive a positive relationship between these two variables.|$|R

30|$|Another {{explanation}} for why high-tenure workers {{are more likely than}} others to experience large earnings losses, in addition to losing firm-specific human capital, is the concept of deferred compensation (delayed payment contracts). In particular, displaced workers’ <b>earnings</b> losses <b>will</b> be higher if, in their previous jobs, they had accepted wages below their level of productivity at the beginning in return for higher earnings {{in the latter part of}} the career (Lazear 1979, 1981; Hutchens 1989).|$|R

30|$|A final {{possible}} reason why formal sector wage employees may {{earn more than}} similar self-employed workers is that formal sector employees may successfully bargain {{for a portion of}} the quasi-rents earned by firms. Several studies have identified non-competitive rents as an important determinant of inter-industry wage differentials. 2 Most recently, Abowd et al. (2012) find that shared quasi-rents account for a large percentage of inter-industry wage differentials in the United States and France. Based on wage bargaining models that allow for on the job search (i.e. Cahuc et al. (2006)), they posit that the wage formal sector firms pay employees is the sum of the opportunity cost of wage employment plus the workers’ share of quasi-rents. Under the assumption that earnings in self-employment or the informal sector is an approximation of comparable formal sector wage workers’ opportunity cost, the self-employment and informal employment <b>earnings</b> penalties <b>will</b> be determined by the bargaining power of workers {{and the size of the}} quasi-rents. That is, the self-employment and informal sector <b>earnings</b> penalty <b>will</b> increase if the relative bargaining power of formal sector employees increases or if firms’ quasi-rents increase.|$|R
