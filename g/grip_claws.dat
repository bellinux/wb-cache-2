40|$|Exploring the {{relationship}} between phenotype and performance in an ecological and evolutionary context is crucial to understanding the adaptive nature of phenotypic traits. Despite their ubiquity in vertebrates, {{few studies have examined}} the functional and ecological significance of claw morphologies. Here we examine the adhesive toepad and claw system of Anolis lizards. Claw characters are significantly different between lizards classified as arboreal (perch height >= 1 m) and non-arboreal (perch height < 1 m). Arboreal species possess significantly higher and longer claws, and show trends toward decreased claw curvature and wider claw tip angles. Toepad size and claw length and height are tightly correlated {{with each other and with}} perch height, suggesting that the adhesive toepad and <b>gripping</b> <b>claw</b> have co-evolved to accommodate different habitats. The functional morphology and evolution of claws are ripe areas for future investigation...|$|R

50|$|Chirit, Tendesciurus rufus: a {{strictly}} herbivorous, long-bodied, North American squirrel, {{with a body}} like an inchworm. It is a typical plant-eating mammal abundant in the trees of the deciduous forests of North America. Its hind feet, although small and short, are very powerful and have strong, <b>gripping</b> <b>claws.</b> The underside of its short tail is hard and scaly and with its hind feet has a strong three-point anchor that can secure the rodent to the tree while it reaches for food. Solidly bound to the tree by its hind feet and tail, the chirit can reach at almost any angle. Since its ancestor's jumping ability has disappeared, the animal can only move from one tree to another by grasping an extended branch; for this reason the chirit is found most often in dense thickets. Its only enemies are birds of prey, {{and it is only}} vulnerable to these in the topmost branches. It makes nests in holes in trees and often occupies holes and hollows excavated by wood-boring birds. The chirit moves forward in a series of leaps and stretches reminiscent of a caterpillar. Hard, leathery skin and scales cover the underside of the chirit's hindquarters. It eats shoots and leaf buds in the spring and fruits and nuts (such as acorns) in the autumn.|$|R

60|$|So far as Frank could see, {{the eagle}} had seized the salmon {{by the middle}} of its back, the fish {{twisting}} itself crossways as it was carried up into the air. The next moment there was a splash in the water and the bird swooped down again. When it rose it held its prey differently, and Frank fancied he could see one wicked <b>claw</b> <b>gripping</b> the fish close by the back of its neck, while the other was spread out toward its tail. In any case, the salmon did not seem able to wriggle now, and the eagle flew off with it and vanished among the tops of the black firs.|$|R
40|$|Operant {{discrimination}} {{learning has}} been extensively utilized in the study on the perceptual ability of animals and their higher-order brain functions. We tested in this study whether American lobster Homarus americanus, which was previously found to possess ability of operant learning with <b>claw</b> <b>gripping,</b> could be trained to discriminate light stimuli of different intensities. For the current purpose, we newly developed a PC-controlled operant chamber that allowed the animal under a body-fixed condition to perform operant reward learning with <b>claw</b> <b>gripping.</b> Lobsters were first reinforced when they gripped the sensor bar upon presentation of a light cue. Then they were trained to grip the bar only when the light stimulus of a specific intensity was presented to obtain food reward while the stimuli of three different intensities including the reinforced one were presented in a random order. Finally, they were re-trained to grip the bar only when the light stimulus of another intensity that was not rewarded in the preceding training to obtain food while other intensities including {{the one that was}} rewarded previously were not rewarded any more. In these training procedures, the operant behavior occurred more frequently in response to the rewarded cue than to the non-rewarded one. The action latency for the reinforced stimuli showed a significant decrease in the course of training. These data demonstrate that lobsters can be trained with the light cues of different intensity as discriminative stimuli under a restrained condition that would allow application of electrophysiological techniques to the behaving subjects...|$|R
2500|$|Leopard {{cats are}} carnivorous, feeding {{on a variety}} of small prey {{including}} mammals, lizards, amphibians, birds and insects. In most parts of their range, small rodents such as rats and mice form the major part of their diet, which is often supplemented with grass, eggs, poultry, and aquatic prey. They are active hunters, dispatching their prey with a rapid pounce and bite. Unlike many other small cats, they do not [...] "play" [...] with their food, maintaining a tight <b>grip</b> with their <b>claws</b> until the animal is dead. This {{may be related to the}} relatively high proportion of birds in their diet, which are more likely to escape when released than are rodents.|$|R
500|$|The seven free {{segments}} of the thorax each bear a pair of unbranched pereopods (limbs). In most species these are used for locomotion and are of much the same size, morphology and orientation, giving the order its name [...] "Isopoda", from the Greek equal foot. In a few species, the front pair are modified into gnathopods with <b>clawed,</b> <b>gripping</b> terminal segments. The pereopods are not used in respiration, as are the equivalent limbs in amphipods, but the coxae (first segments) are fused to the tergites (dorsal plates) to form epimera (side plates). In mature females, {{some or all of}} the limbs have appendages known as oostegites which fold underneath the thorax and form a brood chamber for the eggs. In males, the gonopores (genital openings) are on the ventral surface of segment eight and in the females, they are in a similar position on segment six.|$|R
60|$|Sometimes {{the crows}} {{find one of}} these snowy {{visitors}} on the beach, and make a great fuss and racket, as they always do when an owl is in sight. At such times he takes his stand under a bank, or {{in the lee of}} a rock, where the crows cannot trouble him from behind, and sits watching them fiercely. Woe be to the one that ventures too near. A plunge, a <b>grip</b> of his <b>claw,</b> a weak caw, and it's all over. That seems to double the crows' frenzy--and that is the one moment when you can approach rapidly from behind. But you must drop flat when the crows perceive you; for the owl is sure to take a look around for the cause of their sudden alarm. If he sees nothing suspicious he will return to his shelter to eat his crow, or just to rest his sensitive ears after all the pother. A quarter-mile away the crows sit silent, watching you and him.|$|R
60|$|The owl lit upon a knoll, not {{two hundred}} yards from where I sat motionless, {{and gave me a}} good {{opportunity}} of watching him at his meal. He treated the fish exactly as he would have treated a rat or duck: stood on it with one foot, <b>gripped</b> the long <b>claws</b> of the other through it, and tore it to pieces savagely, as one would a bit of paper. The beak was not used, except to receive the pieces, which were conveyed up to it by his foot, as a parrot eats. He devoured everything--fins, tail, skin, head, and most of the bones, in great hungry mouthfuls. Then he hopped {{to the top of the}} knoll, sat up straight, puffed out his feathers to look big, and went to sleep. But with the first slight movement I made to creep nearer, he was wide awake and flew to a higher point. Such hearing is simply marvelous.|$|R
50|$|The {{success rate}} of winning a prize is {{dependent}} on several factors including operator settings, player skill, type of machine, and the prizes available (size, density, and distribution). A prize may be lost due to player inexperience, player error in manipulating the claw, {{the weakness of the}} claw, or the specific crane configuration. Many modern cranes use a computer to determine an expected payout percentage based on the operator's settings. All modern claw machines incorporate some means for the owner to adjust at least the strength of the <b>claw's</b> <b>grip</b> and how closely the claw's fingers pull together, usually with screws on the mechanism or potentiometers on the PCB. Even on older machines, the grip strength can be adjusted by adding circuit components or additional hardware. Some machines incorporate a feature called two-level claw power, which, when enabled, causes the claw to at first grip at full strength, but then gradually weaken its grip to the normal level after a brief delay. This can cause the crane to initially pick up the prize, but then drop it.|$|R
40|$|Operant {{conditioning}} is {{a common}} tool for studying cognitive aspects of brain functions. As {{the first step toward}} understanding those functions in simple invertebrate microbrains, we tested whether operant conditioning could be applied to train American lobster Homarus americanus that has been extensively adopted as an animal model for neurophysiological analyses of nervous system functions and behavioral control. The animal was trained by food rewarding for gripping of a sensor bar as the operant behavior. Lobsters were first reinforced when they acted on the bar with a stronger grip than a pre-set value. After this reinforcement, the animal learnt to grip the bar for food pellets. The yoked control experiment in which the animal received action-independent reinforcement excluded the possibility of pseudoconditioning that the food simply drove the animal to frequent gripping of the sensor bar. The association of the bar grip with food was extinguished by rewarding nothing to the operant behavior, and was restored by repeating the reinforcement process as before. In addition, lobsters successfully carried out differential reinforcement regarding the gripping force: their gripping force changed depending on the increased force threshold for food reward. These data demonstrate that lobsters can be trained by operant conditioning paradigms involving acquisition and extinction procedures with the precise <b>claw</b> <b>gripping</b> even under the force control...|$|R
60|$|The canoe shot {{up behind}} a point where, {{looking over the}} low bank, I had the arena {{directly}} under my eye. The animal was a fisher--black-cat the trappers call him--the most savage and powerful fighter of his size in the whole world, I think. In the instant that I first saw him, quicker than thought he had hurled himself twice at the towering bird's breast. Each time he was met by a lightning blow in the face from Quoskh's stiffened wing. His teeth ground the big quills to pulp; his claws tore them into shreds; but he got no grip in the feathery mass, and he slipped, clawing and snarling, into the grass, only to spring again like a flash. Again the stiff wing blow; but this time his jump was higher; one <b>claw</b> <b>gripped</b> the shoulder, tore its way through flying feathers to the bone, while his weight dragged the big bird down. Then Quoskh shortened her neck in a great curve. Like a snake it glided {{over the edge of}} her own wing for two short, sharp down-thrusts of the deadly javelin--so quick that my eye caught only the double yellow flash of it. With a sharp screech the black-cat leaped away and whirled towards me blindly. One eye was gone; an angry red welt showed just over the other, telling how narrowly the second thrust had missed its mark.|$|R
60|$|The most savage bit of {{his hunting}} that I ever saw was one dark winter afternoon, {{on the edge}} of some thick woods. I was {{watching}} a cat, a half-wild creature, that was watching a red squirrel making a great fuss over some nuts which he had hidden, and which he claimed somebody had stolen. Somewhere behind us, Kookooskoos was watching from a pine tree. The squirrel was chattering {{in the midst of a}} whirlwind of leaves and empty shells which he had thrown out on the snow from under the wall; behind him the cat, creeping nearer and nearer, had crouched with blazing eyes and quivering muscles, her whole attention fixed on the spring, when broad wings shot silently over my hiding place and fell like a shadow on the cat. One set of strong <b>claws</b> <b>gripped</b> her behind the ears; the others were fastened like a vise in the spine. Generally one such grip is enough; but the cat was strong, and at the first touch sprang away. In a moment the owl was after her, floating, hovering above, till the right moment came, when he dropped and struck again. Then the cat whirled and fought like a fury. For a few moments there was a desperate battle, fur and feathers flying, the cat screeching like mad, the owl silent as death. Then the great claws did their work. When I straightened up from my thicket, Kookooskoos was standing on his game, tearing off the flesh with his feet, and carrying it up to his mouth with the same movement, swallowing everything alike, as if famished.|$|R
5000|$|Garuda Pancasila is the {{national}} emblem of Indonesia. The symbol derived from Garuda, the mythical bird vehicle of Vishnu. The current symbol are designed and officially recognised in 1950s. The head of Garuda faces its right side, it means that Indonesia embraces democracy. If it faces its left side, it means Indonesia is leaning on socialism. The Garuda's feathers represent the date of Indonesia's independence day which is 17 August 1945. The total feathers of the wings are 17 in each left and right wings. The total feathers in the tail are 8 and feathers of its neck are 45 in total. Indonesian national emblem is the Garuda with a heraldic shield on its chest and a scroll gripped by its leg. The shield's five emblems represent Pancasila, the five principles of Indonesia's national philosophy. Those five symbols of principle has its own meaning. First, the star in the middle symbolise sacred divinity, which means Indonesia is a state {{which is based on}} five recognised religions. Second, the chain with square and round links symbolises male and female as well as succession of generations of human beings that represent just and civilised humanity. Third, the big beringin (banyan tree) with multitude of branches, leaves and roots symbolises diversity of Indonesian people that belongs into one organism, symbolise unity of Indonesia, as well as strong and steady stance and protection under the tree's shade. Forth, the head of a buffalo symbolise the people power or democracy, since water buffalo is the important domesticated animal in Indonesian agricultural culture. The last one, rice and cotton ears as main grain yields in Indonesia symbolise the fulfilments of humans needs of food and clothing which means prosperity. The Garuda <b>claws</b> <b>gripping</b> a white ribbon scroll inscribed with {{the national}} motto Bhinneka Tunggal Ika written in black text, which can be loosely translated as [...] "Unity in Diversity". Garuda Pancasila was designed by Sultan Hamid II from Pontianak, supervised by Sukarno.|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviours}} used by mammalian predators {{to capture}} and process their prey play {{a pivotal role in}} determining hunting success when targeting different species, or prey in different foraging environments. This is especially true in aquatic environments, where marine mammals like pinnipeds encounter a wide range of prey species while hunting both in open water and near the sea floor. However, due to difficulties faced when observing behaviour in diving mammals, {{little is known about the}} mechanics of prey handling in most pinnipeds species. The aim of this thesis was to remedy this by performing captive feeding trials that explored how foraging behaviours varied under different conditions for otariid species that have not been studied before now. When capturing small fish in open water, Australian fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus) used raptorial biting. Rather than simply snapping at prey with the jaws, this involved combined use of biting and suction, where they used suction to draw prey within range of the teeth before the jaws snapped shut. In contrast, when capturing prey concealed within a feeding device, fur seals used strong suction alone to draw prey into the mouth. Australian and subantarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus tropicalis) swallowed small prey whole after the initial capture, while large prey was first brought to the surface and processed into smaller pieces by shaking. By chewing on prey between shakes, the fur seals created weak points that made it more likely to break when shaken further. Australian sea lions (Neophoca cinerea) were also able to chew and shake food; however, unlike fur seals, they also tore food held between their forelimbs and teeth. By directly observing how prey capture and processing occurs in otariid pinnipeds, we are able to begin to draw broader comparisons between these species and the other main clades of pinnipeds. Phocine phocids (the northern seals) also use biting and suction when capturing large vs. small prey, but unlike fur seals they are able to <b>grip</b> prey in <b>clawed</b> forelimbs while processing it with their teeth. Monachine phocids (the “southern” seals) have forelimbs intermediate in morphology between the clawed phocines and highly derived otariids. Those that have been studied or observed seem to display similar behaviours to the fur seals from our studies. Australian sea lions are unusual in being similar to phocine seals that hold prey in their forelimb flippers, but rather than using claws to secure prey, they squeezed prey between flat palms. These patterns highlight key differences in behaviour that may relate to differences in forelimb morphology that stem from the degrees to which each clade has adapted its anatomy for aquatic locomotion. By making direct observations of behaviour for a wide range of pinniped species we can therefore identify patterns that provide a better understanding of the role that foraging behaviour played throughout pinniped evolution. These results also provide insights into how prey capture and processing behaviours influence the foraging choices made by seals hunting at sea, providing insights into what makes pinnipeds such successful marine predators...|$|R
