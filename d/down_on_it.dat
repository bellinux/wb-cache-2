2500|$|When Hinrich's {{teammate}} Ben Gordon heard Riley's comments, {{he came to}} {{his defense}} stating [...] "I heard him saying something about Kirk. Posey's was way more blatant. I don't think Kirk did anything. He was just playing aggressive defense. Kirk didn't do anything dirty. I don't appreciate him taking shots at our guys." [...] Sports Illustrated columnist Chris Mannix called Riley's comments [...] "on the border of hypocrisy" [...] while maintaining that Hinrich's grab of Wade's wrist, while illegal, was not a dirty play. [...] "For starters, the play itself hardly qualifies as dirty. That was not the word Riley chose, but it was certainly what he insinuated. Illegal, yes. But dirty?" [...] "Hinrich {{had no intention of}} hurting Wade. He didn't grab his wrist and twist it. He didn't chop <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> with his other hand." [...] He went on to describe plays like that commonplace in the NBA, while calling Posey's foul on Hinrich during the 2006 playoffs dirty. [...] "Dirty was the cheap shot that James Posey delivered to Hinrich when he leveled the guard with a body check during last season's playoffs." ...|$|E
2500|$|With the {{win over}} Branko CikatiÄ‡, Andy Hug proved {{himself to be}} {{competent}} kickboxer and was entered into his first K-1 World Grand Prix, fighting at the K-1 Grand Prix '94 on April 30, 1994 where he faced Patrick Smith in the quarter-finals. Hug lost the match. He struggled with Smith's aggression and punch-heavy style, suffering three knockdowns in nineteen seconds and losing by technical knockout. Hug had problems with his gumshield as his molars didn't clamp <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> properly and he was instead pinching it with his incisors. In time, however, the K-1 doctors discovered the dental problems and fitted him with a mouthpiece that would provide standard protection. The rematch between Andy Hug and Pat Smith took place at K-1 Revenge on September 18, 1994 and the American again opened with an axe kick just as he done in the first fight. This time, however, Hug countered with the [...] "Hug Tornado", sweeping Smith to the canvas. As the fight went on, Hug weathered Smith's aggressive start and completed his revenge when he knocked him unconscious with a knee at the 0:56 mark of round one. In a kickboxing match at the 1994 Seidokaikan Karate World Cup on October 2, 1994, he scored a third round liver kick knockout of Duke Roufus before closing out the year by winning the UKF World Super Heavyweight Championship with a spectacular fourth-round KO win against Rob van Esdonk at K-1 Legend on December 10, 1994.|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash deduced {{from the}} words [...] "Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her" [...] in [...] that Abraham came {{directly}} from Mount Moriah and the binding of Isaac. The Midrash told {{that at the}} very moment in [...] that the angel of the Lord stayed Abraham from sacrificing Isaac, the Satan appeared to Sarah in the guise of Isaac. When Sarah saw him, she asked what Abraham had done to him. He told Sarah that Abraham had taken him to a mountain, built an altar, placed wood upon it, tied him <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> and took a knife to slaughter him, and had God not told him not to lay a hand on him, Abraham would have slaughtered him. As soon as he finished speaking, Sarah's soul departed. Similarly, reading [...] "And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah," [...] the Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer reported that Abraham came from Mount Moriah to find that Sarah had died. When Abraham set out from Mount Moriah in peace, the anger of Sammael (the Satan) was kindled, for he saw that his desire to frustrate Abraham's offering had not been realized. So Sammael told Sarah that Abraham had killed Isaac and offered him as a burnt offering upon the altar. Sarah began to weep and to cry aloud three times, corresponding to the three sustained notes (of the shofar), and she gave forth three howlings corresponding to the three disconnected short notes (of the shofar), and her soul fled, and she died.|$|E
