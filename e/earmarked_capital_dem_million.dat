Green bonds have emerged as tool to <b>earmark</b> <b>capital</b> for green investments, but the question remains whether green bonds accelerate green investments. This study outlines the advantages and disadvantages of green bond issuances in order to identify why green bonds could result in accelerated green investments. The data is acquired through interviews with investors and issuers, a survey among European issuers as well as a case study at AkzoNobel. The study also asks the question how green bonds could reduce the environmental impacts from the chemical industry. The results indicate that there are significant benefits in terms of company reputation, access to capital and internal legitimacy linked to the issuance of a green bond. The case study also indicates that a green bond issuance can have implications on the internal hierarchy of decision making by the addition of an environmental dimension to evaluation of investments. A green bond may bridge the historic gap between financial and sustainability departments. The conclusion is that green bonds accelerate green investments, as green bonds provide issuers with access to capital, increased company reputation, increased internal legitimacy for sustainability issues and shift decision power within companies. The efficiency of green bonds could be enhanced by the development of industry specific criteria, to have an impact along the entire value-chain to ensure significant environmental benefits...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} mechano-electrical feedback and atrial fibrillation induced electrical remodelling (AFER) of cellular ion channel properties on the dynamics of spiral waves in a discrete 2 D model of human atrial tissue. The tissue electro-mechanics are modelled using the discrete element method (<b>DEM).</b> <b>Millions</b> of bonded <b>DEM</b> particles form a network of coupled atrial cells representing 2 D cardiac tissue, allowing simulations of the dynamic behaviour of electrical excitation waves and mechanical contraction in the tissue. In the tissue model, each cell is modelled by nine particles, accounting for the features of individual cellular geometry; and discrete inter-cellular spatial arrangement of cells is also considered. The electro-mechanical model of a human atrial single-cell was constructed by strongly coupling the electrophysiological model of Colman et al. to the mechanical myofilament model of Rice et al., with parameters modified based on experimental data. A stretch-activated channel was incorporated into the model to simulate the mechano-electrical feedback. In order to {{investigate the}} effect of mechano-electrical feedback on the dynamics of spiral waves, simulations of spiral waves were conducted in both the electromechanical model and the electrical-only model in normal and AFER conditions, to allow direct comparison of the results between the models. Dynamics of spiral waves were characterized by tracing their tip trajectories, stability, excitation frequencies and meandering range of tip trajectories. It was shown that the developed DEM method provides a stable and efficient model of human atrial tissue with considerations of the intrinsically discrete and anisotropic properties of the atrial tissue, which are challenges to handle in traditional continuum mechanics models. This study provides mechanistic insights into the complex behaviours of spiral waves and the genesis of atrial fibrillation by showing an important role of the mechano-electrical feedback in facilitating and promoting atrial fibrillation...|$|R

Similarly, in 2013, out of a total national budget of NGN 4. 92 trillion or USD 30. 75 billion, only the sum of NGN 1. 50 trllion or USD 9. 38 billion was voted for capital expenditure. Therefore, based on the data sourced from the Nigerian Office of Statistics, Central bank of Nigeria Statistical Bulletin {{as well as from the}} United Nations Development Programme, this study examined the causes of high cost {{of governance}} in Nigeria. It found out that the high cost of governance in the country is in the interest of the ruling class, arising from their unethical behaviour – corrupt practices and the poor management of public resources. As a result, the study recommends the need to intensify the war against corruption and mismanagement of public resources by government officials as possible solution to overcome the high cost of governance in Nigeria. This could be achieved by strengthening the constitutional powers of the various anti-corruption agencies in the area of arrest, investigation and prosecution of offenders without the interference of the executive arm of government either at the local, state or federal level.

40|$|Digital {{elevation}} models (DEM) {{are widely}} used in hydrological applications for computing useful topographic parameters such as slope, flow direction, flow accumulation area and stream channel network. However, DEMs generally contain numerous topographic depressions which are real and/or artifactual. These depressions can {{take the form of}} single cells (pits) or contiguous areas in DEM (depressions). The problem with these pits and depressions is that they interrupt continuous flow paths in DEMs. To avoid these problems, all pits have to be rectified and create a depressionless DEM before calculating flow directions or any related topographic parameters. Agency provided DEMs may be pit filled, but pits can also be generated while interpolating DEMs for changing grid spacing (e. g. LiDAR data). Therefore pit filling is an essential requirement for any hydrological study. A number of algorithms have been developed {{over the past few decades}} to treat pits in DEMs. With the availability of high resolution data, <b>DEMs</b> typically contain <b>millions</b> of cells which increase file sizes and computational effort. Therefore, efficiency of pit filling algorithms has to be taken into account when using such DEMs in hydrological applications. In this paper, two of most widely used pit filling algorithms (Jenson and Domingue, 1988 and Planchon, 2001) are compared in terms of their performance and ability to extract topographical parameters. One arc second DEM derived from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data was used in the study. Two study areas were used in the comparison. The first study area is comprised of three catchments located in Eastern Australia and they were used for evaluating topographic changes made by pit filling algorithms. The second study area is located in East coast and it was used to compare the performance of the two algorithms across a regional extent. According to the results, both algorithms behave similarly in modifying existing topography, but calculated flow accumulations and drainage networks were slightly different from each other. When the filled area was relatively small, both algorithms have resulted in similar flow paths. But in relatively large filled areas, they have resulted in unrealistic parallel flow paths significantly different from each other. Both algorithms were implemented in the Python programming language to provide a common platform for comparison. Python is an interpreted language and the Cython tool has been recently developed to convert Python code to C code and allow it to be compiled. Cython was used to convert Python code to C extensions and the performance of both Python and Cython versions were evaluated. Time taken to execute pit filling algorithms on different sizes of DEMs was measured. The execution time of the Planchon algorithm showed a linear relationship with the size of the DEM while execution time of Jenson algorithm increased exponentially. Moreover, performance of both algorithms was evaluated for different resolutions, on a constant grid extent. The execution time of the Jenson algorithm increased with DEM resolution and showed a direct relationship to the total number of pits. However, execution time of Planchon algorithm remained almost constant regardless of the total number of pits. In Cython, both Jenson and Planchon algorithms showed significant improvement in execution time, relative to implementation in Python...|$|R
40|$|Headwater streams begin {{upstream}} at {{the channel}} head and extend downstream to {{the confluence of}} second or third order streams. They may exhibit ephemeral, intermittent, or perennial flow regimes and often comprise {{a disproportionate share of}} the drainage network. Recent studies estimate that intermittent and ephemeral streams comprise 59 % (3, 200, 000 km) of total stream length in the United States. Dense, dendritic and fractal networks exponentially expand the extent of stream reaches. These vast networks are squeezed into the landscape and thus unsurprisingly have a substantial impact on downstream water quality, biodiversity, water supply, nutrient cycling, and water treatment costs. However, despite the importance and predominance of headwater streams in the landscape, their extent remains poorly mapped and understood. The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is the digitized version of USGS 1 : 24, 000 scale topographic maps, which are typically used to locate streams for a variety of planning and regulatory purposes. Numerous studies have found the NHD to be inadequate for determining the extent of stream networks, with underestimations of 56 percent in North Carolina and up to 300 percent in urban areas reported. Moreover, the Piedmont eco-region is expected to urbanize by 165 percent over the next 50 years. Since these small streams thoroughly perfuse the landscape and serve as the most proximate intersection of the lotic and terrestrial environments, they are especially sensitive to development pressure. Thus any attempt to protect the integrity of the Piedmont’s environmental services and water resources will be extraordinarily difficult, and prohibitively costly, if this urban growth cannot be managed to avoid the maximum amount of harm. This study presents a reliable method for locating these streams, including intermittent and ephemeral streams that were recently held to be jurisdictional waters by the EPA. Fieldwork was undertaken from June to October of 2014 in the Edeburn and Korstian Divisions of the Duke Forest. Drainage lines were walked from the downstream position of perennial flow to the upstream channel head position with a high-resolution satellite Global Positioning System (GPS). Four types of channel segments used to categorize stream reaches: (1) presence of water, (2) channelized, (3) presence of pools & riffles, and (4) well-defined concentrated flow. Dietrich and Dunne’s (1993) definition of the channel head, the upstream limit of concentrated flow, was used to classify the four simple types of channel heads recorded in this study: (1) headcuts, (2) spring saps, (3) headwater ponds, & (4) first-order stream heads. Ultimately a total of 117 channel heads and 67 km of streams were mapped in this study. The NHD only displayed 24 km of streams over the same area. This means that the NHD only captured ~ 35 percent of the actual stream network, a significant underestimation. GIS analysis was completed to see if a better estimation of the stream network could be achieved. Three flow routing algorithms (D 8, D∞, MD∞) and grid resolutions (3 -meter, 6 -meter, 10 -meter) were used for sensitivity analysis (9 combinations total) to test flow accumulation thresholds. Two flow accumulation thresholds were selected: (1) Upslope-accumulated area (UAA) A= (∑_(i= 1) ^(# of cells) ▒〖cell〗_i) x (Cell Area), and (2) Slope-area (AS) AS =A*S^ 1 where S is local slope (m/m). UAA and AS values were extracted from mapped channel head locations to compute probability density functions (PDFs) and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs). Median UAA values were found to range from 0. 075 – 1. 122 hectares and median AS values ranged from 43. 98 – 1731. 39 (where A is in m 2). Grid resolution was found to be the dominant control on flow accumulation threshold values with the 3 -meter and 10 -meter DEM providing the smallest values. Flow algorithm choice only appeared to be pertinent for the coarsest DEM, 10 -meter, where the MD∞ algorithm produced half the predicted flow accumulation value of D 8. 50 th (median) and 75 th quantile CDF channel head values were then used to create stream networks for the 3 -meter DEM with the MD∞ algorithm, which had the smallest flow accumulation values. These predicted streams were compared to mapped streams and channel heads. The 75 th quantile channel head values provided the best approximation of the stream network, with minimal overprediction. There was a negligible difference between the two flow accumulation threshold methods, although AS did tend to outperform UAA using the 75 th quantile channel head values. Median channel head values produced a stream network with significant overprediction and feathering, particularly for the AS threshold. A hypsometric curve was also created for the study site, which determined that it is generally dominated by fluvial erosion, but also influenced diffusive processes. A scaling relationship between local slope (m/m) and UAA (ha) was then created with a slope-area curve. The curve gives every grid cell in the <b>DEM</b> (~ 7 <b>million)</b> a set of x, y coordinates that can be plotted in two-dimensional coordinate space. The slope of this curve, or “rollover” point, transitions from dS/dA > 0 at low contributing areas (positive) to dS/dA < 0 at large contributing areas (negative). This transition is associated with a change from diffusive, transport-limited hillslopes to fluvial erosion processes. The curve was fit with a piecewise regression with breakpoints at the median and 75 th quantile channel head values. The transition from positive to negative slope in the regression occurred at the median channel head value. The finding that half the channel heads occur before this transition point suggests that groundwater and subsurface water contributions may be significant, as channel initiation begins before critical hillslope length is reached. The 75 th quantile channel head CDF value was found to accurately delineate the extent of the stream network, while minimizing overprediction. This method for stream network prediction greatly enhances the accuracy hydrography of data when compared to the NHD, especially for temporary headwater streams. While field mapping channel heads is time and labor intensive, {{it can be used to}} better inform and test predictive methods that can quickly and more accurately determine the extent of the stream network...|$|R
