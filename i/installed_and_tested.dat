Due to delays in equipment installation for integration between ERTMS and the older Swedish and (especially) Danish systems, there is a temporary arrangement using ATC. In 2012 (tentatively), when all trains using the City Tunnel are retrofitted, ATC will be removed and ERTMS deployed. Since ERTMS is already <b>installed</b> <b>and</b> <b>tested,</b> the changeover can be done overnight.|$|E

500|$|In January 1997, two bogies were <b>installed</b> <b>and</b> <b>tested</b> on a ST55-tram trailer. On 10 February 1997, a mock-up of the driver's cab {{was made}} in Italy and sent to Oslo to try to {{optimize}} the layout. On 8 April 1997, Oslo Sporveier decided to order an additional 13 trams. The full options were not realized {{due to lack of}} funding. At the same time it was decided that all SM91-trams would be retired, while some SM83-trams would remain in service after the full delivery of the SL95s. By 1998, delivery date for the first vehicle, no. 141, [...] was set to 23 May, with plans to put it into scheduled service on 23 June. The mock-up was scrapped on 12 February. However, the tram was not completed until October, when representatives for the tram company could operate {{it for the first time}} at Firema's plant. This delay was caused by the roof having blown off the plant. A NOK1million discount per tram was granted due to the incident.|$|E

2500|$|Fort Belvoir, Virginia, was the {{headquarters}} of the Army Corps of Engineers and, beginning in 1954, the corps' newly created Army Reactors Branch. This unit was established by the Department of Defense to develop compact nuclear power plants that could be utilized to supply heat and power at remote locations. The army's first nuclear power reactor, the SM-1, was built at Fort Belvoir in 1955–57, and was located in the southeast [...] "corner" [...] of the post, alongside Gunston Cove, off the Potomac River. The SM-1 reactor, also known as the Army Package Reactor Program, was used to train nuclear operations personnel for all three services. For that reason, the MH-1A was <b>installed</b> <b>and</b> <b>tested</b> aboard the Sturgis while it was moored in Gunston Cove, near the SM-1 facility.|$|E

2500|$|By early February {{the guns}} had been <b>installed</b> <b>and</b> <b>tested.</b> The 18-pounders {{were able to}} {{completely}} command the passage between the rock and the island, forcing ships to avoid the channel. The winds and currents meant that these ships were then unable to enter the bay. With work complete by 7 February Hood decided to formalise {{the administration of the}} island, and wrote to the Admiralty, announcing that he had commissioned the rock as a sloop, under the name Fort Diamond. Lieutenant Maurice, who had impressed Hood with his efforts while establishing the position, was rewarded by being made commander. Diamond Rock was to be considered a captured enemy ship, and was technically treated as a tender to one of the boats stationed there, commissioned by the Admiralty as the sloop Diamond Rock, superseding Hood's use of Fort Diamond. [...] This was a mere technicality, and when the boat fell into French hands, another replaced it, and in time the rock became known as the 'Sloop Diamond Rock'. The batteries were also named, the two 18-pounders at the summit were known as 'Fort Diamond' or 'Diamond Battery', while the 24-pounder halfway up was known as 'Hood's Battery'.|$|E
2500|$|The tunnellers {{named the}} {{individual}} quarries after their home towns (Auckland, Wellington, Nelson, Blenheim, Christchurch, Russell and Dunedin for the New Zealanders, and Glasgow, Edinburgh, Crewe and London for the Britons). Assault tunnels were also dug, stopping a few metres {{short of the}} German line, ready to be blown open by explosives {{on the first day}} of the battle. On 4 January 1917, the unit started putting in electricity in the Ronville quarries. Two weeks later, most of the work on the connection tunnels in the Ronville underground system was complete. On 24 January, the New Zealand Tunnelling Company began installing direction signs in the underground system. The next day, they started early works to organise a tramway line into the Ronville and Saint-Sauveur systems. By that time, the tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers had constructed 20kilometres of tunnels, graded as subways (foot traffic only), tramways (with rails for hand-drawn trolleys, for taking ammunition to the line and bringing casualties back from it) and railways (a light railway system). The tunnel system could accommodate 24,000 men and was equipped with running water, electric light, kitchens, latrines, a small power station and a medical centre with a fully equipped operating theatre. In addition to this, conventional mines were laid under the front lines, ready to be blown immediately before the assault. In the meantime, German sappers were actively conducting their own underground operations, seeking out Allied tunnels to assault and counter-mine. On 14–16 March 1917, the German withdrawal on the Hindenburg Line (Siegfried Stellung) made it impossible to attack from the Ronville system. Despite this setback, electricity was <b>installed</b> <b>and</b> <b>tested</b> in the whole system beneath Arras by 3 April 1917, ready for the start of the Battle of Arras on 9 April. On the first day of the battle, the New Zealand Tunnelling Company opened three tunnels located at the end of Saint-Sauveur system, allowing infantrymen to appear suddenly in the German trenches. Owing to the German withdrawal from their front line south-east of Arras, the unit also fired the only mine that was used on the Arras front on 9 April. It was located to the north-east at Blagny, and was a [...] charge, blown by the New Zealand Tunnelling Company at zero, 5.30 a.m. It destroyed two German dugouts, [...] of trench and a concrete pillbox. However, it also stunned and apparently buried some members of the 13th Royal Scots and impeded their assault temporarily.|$|E
