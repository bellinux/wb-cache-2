5|$|Because the Laborers {{had more}} {{applicants}} than jobs available, {{the process for}} getting a job on the pipeline through Laborers Local 942 was a multi-tiered process.

B-level members had to have worked between 100 and 800 hours with the union. C-level members had to have at least two years of experience outside of Alaska or be an Alaska resident for at least one year.

5|$|Michael Ryan, {{director}} of The YoungCuts Film Festival, {{noted that there}} was a precedent for the film in the Air Pirates lawsuit, in which Disney spent eight years in court with some underground cartoonists who had published an underground comix parody in which Mickey Mouse and the other Disney characters engaged in explicit sex and used illegal drugs, among other behavior they avoided in Disney's own narratives. He suggested that Disney buy the rights and release the film itself, which it could easily do as its announced interest would guarantee it a monopsony on the film since no other distributor would want to match Disney's deep pockets or its feared legal response. As a Disney release, Escape from Tomorrow would have a large potential audience of both Disney enthusiasts and antagonists, Disney would be making money from property it already owns instead of someone <b>else</b> <b>and</b> the company's apparent willingness to go in the joke would take some of the satiric edge off.|$|E

5|$|The tale's disappointing qualities {{have been}} {{ascribed}} to Potter's growing {{lack of interest}} in writing for children, to pressure from her publisher for yet another book, and to Potter's desire to exploit the lucrative American market.

Having expected it, however, Jeff reveals his own gun, and knocks Peter and Joe out so that he can kill Quagmire in a deeper part of the woods. Once there, Quagmire talks Jeff into fighting him instead, during which Quagmire is seemingly strangled to death. Jeff then goes to dig a grave to put Quagmire's body in, until he sees an angry Quagmire, alive and well, behind the wheel of Peter's car. Quagmire reveals that he chokes himself everyday and kills Jeff by running him over, smashing his head into a tree with the car. Peter, Joe and Quagmire return home the next day, and present Brenda with a forged note from Jeff stating that he has decided to leave her.
