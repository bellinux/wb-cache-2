40|$|In the Gulf of Mexico {{there is}} a need to assess the {{potential}} of underutilized fish resource stocks before a commercial fishery develops. Standard sampling trawls used in the Gulf are ineffective for sampling the resource, so larger, high opening, bottom trawls have been introduced. The larger trawls are more effective, but most of the faster swimming fish species are able to escape these nets, especially during haul back. To reduce fish escapement, webbing panels, attached inside the trawls ahead of the cod ends, were tested. Initial tests were conducted with two single panel designs [...] a fish flap and a "floppa. " Neither design reduced fish escapement. The floppa distorted the trawl webbing and actually increased fish escapement. A multi-panel conical funnel design (the <b>fish</b> <b>funnel)</b> was tested and found to increase fish retention by trapping the fish after they passed through it. When used in combination with a technique known as pulsing the trawl, the <b>fish</b> <b>funnel</b> substantially increased trawl catch rates with no indication of fish escapement...|$|E

50|$|Gorad Ddu Fish Weir: , SH545715. Scheduled monument. A rock outcrop {{has been}} utilised, along with {{substantial}} masonry arms to create fish traps {{on both the}} west and east sides of the rock. A channel cut through the rock could <b>funnel</b> <b>fish</b> from the eastern to the western chamber. The western side has walls running from both the shore and the island, meeting at a sluice. Grooves in the masonry allowed wattle sluices to drain the basin whilst retaining the fish. An older wall, from an earlier trap, crosses the western basin, and there are remains of holding tanks and other buildings.|$|R
40|$|A {{prototype}} shrimp-fish separator to {{be installed}} between the body and codend of a shrimp trawl was designed and constructed. The separator uses large square meshes to provide an escape path for <b>fish,</b> while <b>funnels</b> constructed of small mesh webbing keep the shrimp away from the big meshes and act as leading panels to guide the fish out of the trawl. A prototype was installed in the cut away after parts of a shrimp trawl, which was then mounted on an oval steel frame and towed {{just below the surface}} so that necessary adjustments could be identified and tested. After a satisfactory design had been developed, fishing trials were carried out in May, 1984, and further modifications to improve the separating efficiency were made. Preliminary analysis of this data shows that up to 61 % of haddock less than 39 cm escaped, and up to 30 % of cod less than 42 cm. Visual observations of a similar separating section were carried out with a remotely controlled underwater TV vehicle, and these are described...|$|R
40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that fishes in short-hydroperiod wetlands display pulses in activity tied to seasonal flooding and drying, with relatively low activity during intervening periods. To evaluate this hypothesis, sampling devices that <b>funnel</b> <b>fish</b> into traps (drift fences) {{were used to}} investigate fish movement across the Everglades, U. S. A. Samples were collected at six sites in the Rocky Glades, a seasonally flooded karstic habitat located on the southeastern edge of the Everglades. Four species that display distinct recovery patterns following drought in long-hydroperiod wetlands were studied: eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) and flagfish (Jordanella floridae) (rapid recovery); and bluefin killifish (Lucania goodei) and least killifish (Heterandria formosa) (slow recovery). Consistent with our hypothesized conceptual model, fishes increased movement soon after flooding (immigration period) and just before drying (emigration period), but decreased activity in the intervening foraging period. We also found that eastern mosquitofish and flagfish arrived earlier and showed stronger responses to hydrological variation than either least killifish or bluefin killifish. We concluded that these fishes actively colonize and escape ephemeral wetlands in response to flooding and drying, and display species-specific differences related to flooding and drying that reflect differences in dispersal ability. These results {{have important implications for}} Everglades fish metacommunity dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Bottom {{trawling}} {{leads to}} recurrent sediment resuspension events over fishing grounds. Recent {{studies have shown}} how bottom trawling can drive seascape reshaping at large spatial scales and enhance sediment transport in submarine canyons, which subsequently impacts deep-sea ecosystems. Present knowledge on the transfer and accumulation of sediment flows triggered by bottom trawling is based on localized and infrequent measurements whilst a more complete picture of the process is needed. The present work focuses on the modeling of sediment transport and accumulation resulting from trawling activities in La Fonera submarine canyon, northwestern Mediterranean Sea, thus contributing to an improved assessment of trawling impacts. Based on mooring data within a canyon gully, we use an inverse model to retrieve the unknown time series of resuspension due to trawling over the fishing grounds. This resuspension is later used as forcing for the direct problem: we simulate trawling-induced flows through the canyon and provide a 3 D visualization of potential trawling impacts on sediment dynamics, including {{the identification of the}} propagation patterns of sediments resuspended by trawling. Flows coming from shallower <b>fishing</b> grounds are <b>funneled</b> through canyon flank gullies towards the canyon axis, with part of the resuspended sediment reaching the continental rise out of the canyon across the open continental slope. Trawling-induced sediment flows promote sediment accumulation beyond the canyon mouth. Given the wide geographical distribution of bottom trawling, our results have far-reaching implications that go much beyond La Fonera submarine canyon. Our study represents a starting point for the assessment of the sedimentary impact of bottom trawling in deep continental margins...|$|R
40|$|The ground ropes {{function}} {{is to keep the}} net in contact with the sea bottom, and herd fishes to the entrance of the bag net. In the case of thinking about selective fishing with a drag net, it is necessary to clarify the shape and herding function of the ground rope. But there are very few reports about it. In this paper, the author considered forces acting on the ground rope under towing conditions, and decided the shape of it analytically. The author designed a fish herding model the ground rope based on the theoretical probability of fiches entering the funnel of a net. Based on these results, the author investigated the shape and gear efficiency of the ground rope. Finally the author intended to obtain rational instructions for designing of ground rope. (1) The construction and weight distribution of three types of ground rope: Danish Seine, Bull Trawl and Trawl, (typical drag nets operated in Japan), were compared. Weight distribution of both Danich Seine and Trawl are uniform. But the mean weight of the later is much heavier than that of the former. It the case of comparison of Trawl and Bull Trawl, the former is long and increases its weight towards the middle. The latter is short and very heavy and shows little difference in its weight distribution. The difference in fishing methods are clearly influenced {{in the construction of the}} two types ground rope. (2) Three forces: hydraulic resistance of netting concentrated at the lacign line, hydraulic resistance of ground rope, and sliding frictional force between sea bottom are acting on the ground rope under towing conditions. At equilibrium those forces made a fixed ground rope shape. The author assumed the ground rope as a connection of segments, and considered an equlibrium among three components acting on them: horizontal, vertical and tangential components. In general it is impossible to express the vertical and horizontal component acting on each segment of the ground rope as a simple function. Assuming that the horizontal component acting on each segment of the ground rope is constant at any part, the length and end distances are known ahead of time, the shape of the ground rope was expressed graphically based on the distribution of vertical components of it which were obtained experimentaly. (3) The vertical component acting on each segment of the ground rope under towing conditions was expressed as the sum of hydraulic resistance, sliding frictional force and sand drag. Drag of clyinder type of bobbins at different lengths and that of sphere type of bobbins in various directions were measured both on wet concrete and in a sand tank with water. The drag of two types bobbin on a rocky bottom (F_D) had no directional qualities, and may be expressed as the product of weight of bobbin (W_B) and drag coefficient (μ_ 90); F_D=μ_ 90 W_B. The drag coefficient of cylinder type of bobbins and sphere type of bobbins were 0. 75 and 0. 68 respectively. The drag of cylinder type of bobbins in towed on a sandy bottom is dependent upon the on attack angle (90 °-θ), and may be expressed the product of the weight of bobbin (W_B) and drag coefficient (μθ) as follows; F_D=μθW_B. The drag coefficient is a function of θ　and is expressed as follows; μθ= 0. 68 (0. 72 sin^[1. 5]θ+cos^[1. 5]θ). In the case of a sphere, the drag coefficient was denoted a constant value of 0. 68. Hydraulic resistance of model ground rope composed of clyinder type of bobbins was measured in a circulating tank. Hydraulic drag coefficient (C_D) showed a constant value of about 0. 45. (4) Three types of model ground rope differing in weight distribution were made. These were examined both on wet concrete and sandy sea bottom under various conditions for the purpose of measuring shape and resistance. Close agreement was shown between experimental values of the shape and resistance of them, and those of calculated values obtained by analytically using the drag coeffieients mentioned above. When the distribution of forces acting on ground rope uder towing condition are known, the shape of it can be decided using the method proposed in this study. On the other hand the weight distribution of ground rope for making a certain ground rope shape can be decided using the method proposed in this study. (5) The author paid attention to fish reaction to the ground rope and considered a fish herding model for the ground rope. Theoretical probability of <b>fishes</b> entering the <b>funnel</b> of the bag net was calculated, and six theoretical types of ground rope: triangle, trapezoid, half ellipse, arc, parabola and catenary were compared. The fishing efficiency of trapezoid, parabola, half ellipse and catenary showed almost same values under towing condition based on the fish herding model for flat fish. The wing tips distance at maximum fishing efficiency was wider than usual towing conditions. Higher fishing efficiency would be expected under that towing condition. Fishing efficiency of two types of ground rope, middle-weighted Bull Trawl type and heavy-weighted Trawl type, were compared by towing on a sandy sea bottom using the fish herding model proposed in this study. Fishing efficiency of the former was a little higher than that of the latter. This corelates well with the results of field experiments. (6) The ratio of resistance of ground rope to the total resistance of drag net was about 30 - 35 % under towing condition. It is imposible to change a ground rope shape under towing condition by means of variation on the weight distribution of the ground rope. In the case of thinking on the ground rope shape, it is necessary to consider the hydraulic resistance of netting which were concentrated to the lacing lines and acting on the ground rope. The trapezoid shape glound rope was showed the fishing efficiency using the fish herding model proposed in this study. About 30 - 35 % of resistance of drag net should act on the points both edge of bosom of ground rope to make a trapezoid-shape ground rope. It is one method to concentrate whole drag acting on ground rope and hydraullic resistance of netting there as a results of many considerations on weight distribution of ground rope and the design of lacing lines...|$|R
