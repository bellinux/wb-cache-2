40|$|Abstract—Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) {{are mostly}} {{deployed}} to detect events (i. e., objects or physical changes) at a high/low frequency sampling {{that is usually}} adapted by a central unit (or a sink), thus requiring additional resource usage in WSNs. However, the problem of autonomous adaptive sampling regarding the detection of events has not been studied before. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme, termed “event-sensitive adaptive sampling and low-cost monitoring (e-Sampling) ” by addressing the problem in two stages, which lead to reduced resource usage (e. g., energy, radio bandwidth) in WSNs. First, e-Sampling provides a solution to adaptive sampling that automatically switches between high- and low-frequency intervals to reduce the resource usage while minimizing false negative detections. Second, by analyzing the frequency content, e-Sampling presents an event identification algorithm suitable for decentralized computing in resource-constrained WSNs. In {{the absence of an}} event, “uninteresting ” data is not transmitted to the sink. We apply e-Sampling to structural health monitoring (SHM), which is a typical application of high frequency events. Evaluation via both simulations and experiments validates the advantages of e-Sampling in low-cost event monitoring, and in expanding the capacity of WSNs for high data rate applications.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{develops}} {{an optimal}} decentralized algorithm for sparse signal recovery and demonstrates its application in monitoring localized phenomena using energy-constrained large-scale wireless sensor networks. Capitalizing on the spatial sparsity of localized phenomena, compressive data collection is enforced by turning off {{a fraction of}} sensors using a simple random node sleeping strategy, which conserves sensing energy and prolongs network lifetime. In {{the absence of a}} fusion center, sparse <b>signal</b> recovery via <b>decentralized</b> in-network processing is developed, based on a consensus optimization formulation and the alternating direction method of multipliers. In the proposed algorithm, each active sensor monitors and recovers its local region only, collaborates with its neighboring active sensors through low-power one-hop communication, and iteratively improves the local estimates until reaching the global optimum. Because each sensor monitors the local region rather than the entire large field, the iterative algorithm converges fast, in addition to being scalable in terms of transmission and computation costs. Further, through collaboration, the sensing performance is globally optimal and attains a high spatial resolution commensurate with the node density of the original network containing both active and inactive sensors. Simulations demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.

40|$|SUMMARY The traffic {{congestion}} problem {{in urban areas}} is worsening since traditional traffic signal control systems cannot provide] efficient traffic regulation. Therefore, dynamic traffic signal control in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) recently has received increasing attention. This study devised a multi-agent architecture, the Adaptive and Cooperative Traffic light Agent Model (ACTAM), for a <b>decentralized</b> traffic <b>signal</b> control system. The proposed architecture comprises a data storage and communication layer, a traffic regulation factor processing layer, and a decision-making layer. This study focused on utilizing the cooperation of multi-agents and the prediction mechanism of our architecture, the Forecast Module, to forecast future traffic volume in each individual intersection. The Forecast Module is designed to forecast traffic volume in an intersection via multi-agent cooperation by exchanging traffic volume information for adjacent intersections, since vehicles passing through nearby intersections were believed to significantly influence the traffic volume of specific intersections. The proposed architecture can achieve dynamic traffic signal control. Thus, total delay time of the traffic network under ACTAM can be reduced by 37 % compared to the conventional fixed sequence traffic signal control strategy. Consequently, {{traffic congestion}} in urban areas can be alleviated by adopting ACTAM. key words: intelligent agents, multi-agent systems (MAS), decentralized control, dynamic traffic signal control 1...|$|R

Higher quality infrastructures increase the profitability of capital investment by foreign entrepreneurs. The ruler wishes to maximize the amount of capital investment that flows into the country. Before selecting their investment, entrepreneurs receive a signal on the quality of infrastructures. We consider two cases. First, all entrepreneurs observe the same signal (centralized information). Second, each entrepreneur receives an independently drawn <b>signal</b> (<b>decentralized</b> information). We compare the effectiveness of these two scenarios for incentivizing the ruler. We find remarkably clear-cut results. When the entrepreneurs' investments are strategic complements, centralized information does a better job in incentivizing the ruler. The opposite holds when investments are strategic substitutes. This may help understand the role of media, rating agencies, public announcements, and ambiguity.

40|$|Abstract A discrete-time {{decentralized}} routing {{problem in}} a service system consisting of two service stations and two controllers is investigated.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{we focus}} on <b>decentralized</b> <b>signal</b> processing in Sensor Networks (SN). Four topics are studied: (i) Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation using a Wireless Sensor network (WSN), (ii) multiple target tracking in large SN, (iii) decentralized target detection in SN and (iv) decentralized sequential detection in SN with communication constraints. The first topic of this thesis addresses the problem of estimating the DOA of an acoustic wavefront using a a WSN made of isotropic (hence individually useless) sensors. The WSN was designed according to the SENMA (SEnsor Network with Mobile Agents) architecture with a mobile agent (MA) that successively queries the sensors lying inside its field of view. We propose both fast/simple and optimal DOA-estimation schemes, and an optimization of the MAs observation management is also carried out, with the surprising finding that the MA ought to orient itself at an oblique angle to the expected DOA, rather than directly toward it. We also consider the extension to multiple sources; intriguingly, per-source DOA accuracy is higher when {{there is more than}} one source. In all cases, performance is investigated by simulation and compared, when appropriate, with asymptotic bounds; these latter are usually met after a moderate number of MA dwells. In the second topic, we study the problem of tracking multiple targets in large SN. While these networks hold significant potential for surveillance, it is of interest to address fundamental limitations in large-scale implementations. We first introduce a simple analytical tracker performance model. Analysis of this model suggests that scan-based tracking performance improves with increasing numbers of sensors, but only to a certain point beyond which degradation is observed. Correspondingly, we address model-based optimization of the local sensor detection threshold and the number of sensors. Next, we propose a two-stage tracking approach (fuse-before-track) as a possible approach to overcoming the difficulties in large-sensor surveillance, and we illustrate promising performance results with simulated surveillance data. The third topic of this dissertation deals with distributed target detection in SN using Scan Statistics. We introduce a sequential procedure to detect a target with distributed sensors in a two dimensional region. The detection is carried out in a mobile fusion center which successively counts the number of binary decisions reported by local sensors lying inside its moving field of view. This is a two-dimensional scan statistic an emerging tool from the statistics field that has been applied to a variety of anomaly detection problems such as of epidemics or computer intrusion, but that seems to be unfamiliar to the signal processing community. We show that an optimal size of the field of view exists. We compare the sequential two-dimensional scan statistic test and two other tests. We also present results for system level detection. In the last topic we study a Repeated Significance Test (RST) with applications to sequential detection in SN. We introduce a randomly truncated sequential hypothesis test. Using the framework of a RST, we study a sequential test with truncation time based on a random stopping time. Using the Functional Central Limit Theorem (FCLT) for a sequence of statistics, we derive a general result that can be employed in developing a repeated significance test with random sample size. We present effective methods for evaluating accurate approximations for the probability of type I error and the power function. Numerical results are presented to evaluate the accuracy of these approximations. We apply the proposed test to a decentralized sequential detection in sensor networks (SN) with communication constraints. Finally a sequential detection problem with measurements at random times is investigated. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This work {{considers}} {{the problem of}} obtaining optimal estimates via distributed computation {{in a large scale}} system. The electric power system, the transportation system, and generally any computer or network system, are examples of large scale systems: a <b>decentralized</b> estimation of <b>signals</b> based on observations acquired by spatially distributed sensors is the basis {{for a wide range of}} important applications. In this work, we focus on the problem of reconstructing the initial state of a linear network in the presence of process and measurement noise. We consider a local model information setup, in which the entire dynamical and measurement model is nowhere available and cannot be reconstructed for the computation. Our estimation procedure relies upon a novel technique to solve a consistent system of linear equations, for which we prove correctness and convergence. In the second part of the paper we consider the problem of detecting anomalies in a large scale network driven by noise. Despite the theoretical advances in this field of research, the currently available procedures to enforce security in large scale systems are computationally inefficient and numerically unreliable. Using our optimal estimation scheme, we describe a distributed procedure with performance guarantees that only requires local knowledge of the system model. 1...|$|R
40|$|Based upon quantum-inspired {{entanglement}} in quantum-classical hybrids, {{a simple}} algorithm for instantaneous transmissions of non-intentional messages (chosen at random) to remote distances is proposed. The {{idea is to}} implement instantaneous transmission of conditional information on remote distances via a quantum-classical hybrid that preserves superposition of random solutions, while allowing one to measure its state variables using classical methods. Such a hybrid system reinforces the advantages, and minimizes the limitations, of both quantum and classical characteristics. Consider n observers, and assume that each of them gets {{a copy of the}} system and runs it separately. Although they run identical systems, the outcomes of even synchronized runs may be different because the solutions of these systems are random. However, the global constrain must be satisfied. Therefore, if the observer # 1 (the sender) made a measurement of the acceleration v(sub 1) at t =T, then the receiver, by measuring the corresponding acceleration v(sub 1) at t =T, may get a wrong value because the accelerations are random, and only their ratios are deterministic. Obviously, the transmission of this knowledge is instantaneous as soon as the measurements have been performed. In addition to that, the distance between the observers is irrelevant because the x-coordinate does not enter the governing equations. However, the Shannon information transmitted is zero. None of the senders can control the outcomes of their measurements because they are random. The senders cannot transmit intentional messages. Nevertheless, based on the transmitted knowledge, they can coordinate their actions based on conditional information. If the observer # 1 knows his own measurements, the measurements of the others can be fully determined. It is important to emphasize that the origin of entanglement of all the observers is the joint probability density that couples their actions. There is no centralized source, or a sender of the signal, because each receiver can become a sender as well. An observer receives a signal by performing certain measurements synchronized with the measurements of the others. This means that the signal is uniformly and simultaneously distributed over the observers in a <b>decentralized</b> way. The <b>signals</b> transmit no intentional information that would favor one agent over another. All the sequence of signals received by different observers are not only statistically equivalent, but are also point-by-point identical. It is important to assume that each agent knows that the other agent simultaneously receives the identical signals. The sequences of the signals are true random, so that no agent could predict the next step with the probability different from those described by the density. Under these quite general assumptions, the entangled observers-agents can perform non-trivial tasks that include transmission of conditional information from one agent to another, simple paradigm of cooperation, etc. The problem of behavior of intelligent agents correlated by identical random messages in a decentralized way has its own significance: it simulates evolutionary behavior of biological and social systems correlated only via simultaneous sensoring sequences of unexpected events...|$|R
40|$|There {{is a high}} {{probability}} that communication between vehicles in a traffic network and between vehicles and traffic controllers {{will be the next}} major wave of technological innovation in traffic. The collection of data of communicating vehicles in traffic offers live information about the traffic conditions, which can be used to control traffic optimally. It is expected that in the coming years a new vehicle type will take part in traffic that is able to navigate through traffic without driver and communicates with traffic controllers to share its information and receive its optimal trajectory: the automated vehicle. The automated vehicle is different from the autonomous vehicle, which does not communicate with traffic controllers or other traffic. The traffic mixture consisting of conventional, connected and automated vehicles will change gradually over time. Designing a traffic control strategy that performs well for traffic consisting of different shares of these three types of vehicles and requires only a limited amount of computational power will be a main challenge in traffic control the coming years. This report proposes a traffic control strategy and assesses the influences of this strategy on the network wide traffic conditions using a traffic simulation. In this way, the research will provide insight in the effects of vehicle connectivity and automation on the network wide traffic conditions. Based on the live traffic information from the communicating vehicles in a network, traffic can be controlled from two sides: the traffic signal control and the automated vehicle trajectory control. The traffic control method proposed in this report works as follows: first, the traffic controller collects all the information of connected and automated vehicles in the network to update the vehicle set. Locations and speeds of connected and automated vehicles can be obtained directly. Automated vehicles also provide the traffic controller of information of the non-communicating vehicles in their surroundings, detected by their sensors. Then, the virtual departure time of each vehicle will be determined, which is the time at which the vehicle would depart not hindered by other traffic or traffic signal and can be calculated using the kinematic laws. Also the corresponding virtual departure speed is determined for each vehicle. Then, starting from the first vehicle on the link, the expected departure time will be calculated, based on the virtual departure time and the traffic signal state. The expected departure times and speeds of the other vehicles on the link will be based on their virtual departure time, the expected departure time of the vehicles in front of the vehicle and the signal state. The virtual and expected departure times and speeds are used for both the signal control and the trajectory control. This report presents a <b>decentralized</b> <b>signal</b> control to limit the computational power required in large traffic networks. This signal control is based on the original back-pressure algorithm, which compares the downstream traffic conditions with the upstream traffic conditions around an intersection and makes decisions for the signal control based on the difference in back-pressure of different movements on an intersection. The proposed signal control strategy takes the approaching and exiting vehicles within a certain range from the intersection into account. At the start of each time slot, a prediction is made for the pressure of a link on the intersection {{at the start of the}} next time slot, based on the current number of approaching and exiting vehicles on a link, their expected departure time from the intersection and the expected traffic demand. Based on the predicted pressures at every link that is connected with the intersection, the traffic controller decides whether it should switch the traffic signal at the start of the next time slot. The proposed method for the trajectory control of the automated vehicles is based on the decisions of the traffic controller regarding the traffic signal and the expected departure times and speeds of the vehicles in the network. The main goal of the trajectory control is to use the green phases in an optimal way, i. e. maximizing the amount of departing vehicles per unit of green time. The trajectory control should limit accelerations and decelerations in the network as much as possible to limit emissions and traveller discomfort. Therefore, a third type of departure time and speed, the smooth departure time and speed, is introduced and compared with the expected time and speed of an automated vehicle to optimize its trajectory. The smooth departure time is the moment in time at which the vehicle would depart from the intersection if it would accelerate constantly to the expected departure speed over the total distance to the intersection. If the expected departure time is later in time than the smooth departure time, the vehicle will slow down and vice versa. If the smooth departure time is equal to the expected departure time, the vehicle will accelerate constantly towards the intersection. The proposed control method is tested in a traffic simulation to obtain the effects of the method on the traffic conditions for different traffic scenarios. For each scenario the average traffic time delay, average green time, average and maximum queue length and average acceleration and acceleration time is retrieved from the simulation to assess the effects of the proposed methods on the traffic conditions. The simulated network consists of a two-directional main road with five signalized intersections with side roads. The traffic consists of only cars and other modes of transportation are neglected for simplicity. Different shares of connected and automated vehicles and different vehicle flows in the network are tested. The simulation results show that the proposed signal control strategy leads to relatively short green times, which decrease the intersection throughput and the ability of adjusting the green time ratio between the two crossing roads to the traffic demand. Traffic on the main road encounters relatively longer green times and shorter queue lengths than traffic on the side roads. The throughput of the intersections does not satisfy the traffic demand and therefore, the first intersection will function as a bottleneck and lowers the traffic flow at the next intersections. Therefore, queues especially occur at the first intersection that vehicles encounter. The results show that the higher the penetration rate of communicating vehicles is, the better the traffic controller is able to adapt the signal sequence to the current traffic situation. The signal control requires several improvements in order to function optimally, but has the potency to be a suitable decentralized control method in a partly connected and automated environment. Results regarding the proposed trajectory control show that a higher share of automated vehicles in the network results in a higher average acceleration in a relatively shorter total acceleration time, which is a result of the fluctuations in the vehicle speed due to the trajectory control. However, automated vehicles increase the average number of departing vehicles per unit of green time, which leads to shorter queues and less average travel time delay in the network. Next to the proposed signal control strategy, an existing coordinated signal control strategy is implemented and tested in the simulation without connected or automated vehicles to compare the results with the proposed methods. Simulations of this green wave control result in larger average travel time delays and larger queue lengths due to relatively shorter green phases. The average acceleration, however, is relatively low, since the green wave strategy avoids vehicles to decelerate to complete standstill after they cross the first intersection of the traffic corridor. This research shows that vehicle connectivity and automation offer the ability to improve network wide traffic conditions applying a decentralized traffic control method to control signalized intersections and automated vehicles. Although the proposed traffic control method is not optimized yet, it shows that low shares of connected and automated vehicles in traffic already make a significant difference in the network wide traffic conditions and that the signal sequences and automated vehicle trajectories can be even optimized if these shares get higher. Since the control strategy is decentralized, the required amount of computational power of a traffic controller is limited to the amount that the control of one single intersection requires and is not depending on the network size. This research provides several recommendations for further research to improve the proposed strategy. Instead of taking only vehicles into account within a certain range from the intersection, which all have the same contribution to the back-pressure, an interesting alternative is to take all vehicles around an intersection into account for the back-pressure and add a certain weight to each vehicle based on the distance to the intersection. This weight can be used to determine the contribution of each vehicle to the back-pressure. Next, a threshold for switching and a dynamic slot time instead of a fixed one could be improvements to the proposed method and should be tested in further research. The trajectory can be optimized especially regarding the vehicle accelerations and decelerations. It is recommended to avoid the occurring speed fluctuations in the proposed method by optimizing the acceleration rate that is used for automated vehicles to reach the desired trajectory. It is recommended to test the proposed method in more realistic traffic simulations in further research to get more insight in the effects to real traffic. In that way the control method can be adapted to real traffic. The simulation of this research uses many assumptions regarding several parameters which require further research to optimize the performance of the control method. Last, before implementing the proposed method or a similar method in traffic, further research is required regarding the traffic safety. Especially the fact that automated vehicles are able to depart from intersections exactly at the moment the traffic signal switches to green could lead to unsafe situations, since other traffic users are not yet used to this behaviour of automated vehicles. <br/...|$|R
