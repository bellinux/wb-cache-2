She was {{studying}} nursing at the Grenfell Campus of Memorial University of Newfoundland when she released The Way in August 2009. Also that year, she won a talent-search contest hosted by YC Newfoundland, a Christian youth conference, and, as part of the award, was given time with music professionals who helped her with <b>Imperfections</b> & Directions, which was released at the 2010 YC Newfoundland. Loder's nursing studies hampered her ability to showcase <b>Imperfections</b> & Directions by touring. Loder was nominated as Female Artist of the Year at the 2010 MusicNL awards, and then as Gospel Artist of the Year in 2011. <b>Imperfections</b> & Directions was nominated as Contemporary Christian/Gospel Album of the Year at the 2012 Juno Awards.|$|E

40|$|The {{motivation}} {{of this research}} is that the ship deck is subjected to uni-axial compression under sagging condition, when in the severe condition, the deck is dynamically loaded in nature, with impact type loads, which is the reason of deck collapse under severe condition. In addition, <b>imperfection</b> probably substantially influences the dynamic response of the impacted deck. Based on nonlinear explicit finite element method, the paper aims at studying the influence of three types of initial geometric <b>imperfection</b> on dynamic response of cross-stiffened deck subjected to in-plane impact. Three types of <b>imperfection</b> are local <b>imperfection</b> on deck plate between stiffeners, <b>imperfection</b> of overall positive deflection of the deck, and <b>imperfection</b> of overall negative deflection of the deck. Impact function is a half sine wave function with two parameters, impact duration and amplitude of the impact load. First order natural vibration period of the deck is selected as impact duration. Amplitude of the impact load is selected according to the value of ultimate strength of the deck, and varied by times of the ultimate strength. Strain rate effect and Strain hardening effect of the material are accounted in the analysis. Axial residual displacement {{of the end of the}} deck after impact is selected as dynamic response of the deck. The result shows that dynamic response of deck is sensitive to local <b>imperfection,</b> while not sensitive to overall <b>imperfection</b> under low or moderate level of <b>imperfection</b> magnitude. When <b>imperfection</b> is severe, residual axial displacement of the end of the deck is large, especially amplitude of impact load is somewhat larger than ultimate strength. Among 3 kinds of <b>imperfection,</b> dynamic response of overall negative deflection <b>imperfection</b> is the largest, followed by that of local <b>imperfection,</b> while that of overall positive deflection <b>imperfection</b> is the least. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe propose an {{approach}} that propagates <b>imperfection</b> throughout a model of land cover change prediction.

The flow characteristics correspond to film cooling in gas turbines. A production <b>imperfection</b> is represented with the small variation of the hole geometry.

If the <b>imperfection</b> is absent, the flow field is stable and clockwise vortices are detected downstream. The <b>imperfection</b> blocks the hole, accelerates the jet and changes the formation of large vortical structures. It produces the additional windward vortices, which influence the flow field and enhance the inflow of the cross-stream towards the cooled surface.

5|$|In {{addition}} to this primary compression wave, other waves, known as harmonics, are created. Harmonics are caused by factors including the imperfect wobbling and shaking of the reed, the reed sealing the mouthpiece opening {{for part of the}} wave cycle (which creates a flattened section of the sound wave), and <b>imperfections</b> (bumps and holes) in the bore. A wide variety of compression waves are created, but only some (primarily the odd harmonics) are reinforced. These extra waves are what gives the clarinet its characteristic tone.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a multi mode finite element {{implementation}} of Koiter’s initial post-buckling theory with {{the inclusion of}} the pre-buckling nonlinearity is presented. The implementation is done in a general purpose finite element code. Using this implementation a coupled mode initial post-buckling analysis of an axially loaded composite cylindrical shell is carried out with a small number of representative modes. For coupled mode asymmetric <b>imperfection</b> sensitivity analysis the most <b>imperfection</b> sensitive path of the structure is obtained in the frame of minimum path theory and the <b>imperfection</b> sensitivity analysis is done by varying the <b>imperfection</b> amplitude in that specific direction. Single mode perturbation analysis results show a reasonable agreement with semi-analytical results.

5|$|Lead {{is added}} to copper alloys such as brass and bronze, to improve {{machinability}} and for its lubricating qualities. Being practically insoluble in copper the lead forms solid globules in <b>imperfections</b> throughout the alloy, such as grain boundaries. In low concentrations, as well as acting as a lubricant, the globules hinder the formation of swarf as the alloy is worked, thereby improving machinability. Copper alloys with larger concentrations of lead are used in bearings. The lead provides lubrication, and the copper provides the load-bearing support.|$|E
5|$|Martensite {{has a lower}} density (it expands {{during the}} cooling) than does austenite, so that the {{transformation}} between them results in a change of volume. In this case, expansion occurs. Internal stresses from this expansion generally {{take the form of}} compression on the crystals of martensite and tension on the remaining ferrite, with a fair amount of shear on both constituents. If quenching is done improperly, the internal stresses can cause a part to shatter as it cools. At the very least, they cause internal work hardening and other microscopic <b>imperfections.</b> It is common for quench cracks to form when steel is water quenched, although they may not always be visible.|$|E
5|$|Production at Site S ceased in late 1945 due to {{the cold}} weather. All work was then done at Salt Wells.

He used Logic 8 recording software on his Mac Pro and often worked late nights in a nearby conference room while they recorded in the studio with drafts of his beats. Smith produced rhythm tracks with an Akai MPC sampler, which he occasionally processed through a Roland RE-201 and other effects units. He also created click tracks for the rest of the band to keep timing when they recorded their individual parts. After those parts had been recorded, he refined and incorporated his beats into the songs for three to four weeks. Croft trusted that Smith, who did not want to conceal any <b>imperfections</b> by overproducing xx, would make it practical for them to perform live rather than layer the songs with several guitar or vocal elements.|$|E
40|$|A concept {{involving}} the interpersonal expression of perfection, perfectionistic self-presentation, is introduced. It {{is argued that}} perfectionistic self-presentation is a maladaptive self-presentational style composed of three facets: perfectionistic self-promotion (i. e., proclaiming and displaying one’s perfec-tion), nondisplay of <b>imperfection</b> (i. e., concealing and avoiding behavioral demonstrations of one’s <b>imperfection),</b> and nondisclosure of <b>imperfection</b> (i. e., evading and avoiding verbal admissions of one’s <b>imperfection).</b> Several studies involving diverse samples demonstrate that perfectionistic self-presentation is a valid and reliable construct and a consistent factor in personal and interpersonal psychological distress. It is argued that the need to promote one’s perfection or the desire to conceal one’s <b>imperfection</b> involves self-esteem regulation in the interpersonal context. The burgeoning research on personality and its influence on psychological problems has demonstrated that various personality traits are associated with various forms of psychopathology.
