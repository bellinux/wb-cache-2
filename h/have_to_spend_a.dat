5|$|The game {{featured}} advanced {{artificial intelligence}} {{due to the}} inclusion of the game's squad command system. Adams and Lugo will assist Walker in battles and react to the battle situation accordingly even if they are not given any orders. They will also analyse the situation when instructed and decide the best approach to defeat enemies. The battle command system was designed to be accessible and easy to use, so that players would not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> lot of time managing the squad. Lugo and Adams may get severely injured and if both of them die, the game ends. This mechanic prompts the player to rescue them as quickly as possible, and the system is designed to create tense situations. The AI for enemies is affected by various factors, including visibility and hearing.|$|E
25|$|Garrincha {{was subject}} to {{numerous}} transfer attempts by rich European clubs like Juventus of Turin, Italy who tried to sign him in 1954. Real Madrid of Spain tried to sign him in 1959 after some stunning performances by him {{on a tour of}} Europe. Internazionale, AC Milan and Juventus of Italy considered jointly signing him in 1963 (he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> season with each); a deal that would have been unique in football.|$|E
500|$|Chauvel was {{promoted}} to colonel in 1913. On 3 July 1914, he sailed for England {{with his wife and}} three children to replace Colonel James Gordon Legge as the Australian representative on the Imperial General Staff. While he was still travelling, the First World War broke out. On reporting for duty at the War Office in mid-August 1914, Chauvel was given a cable directing him to assume command of the 1st Light Horse Brigade of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) when it arrived in the United Kingdom. Chauvel became concerned with slow progress on construction of the AIF's proposed quarters on the Salisbury Plain. He made frequent visits to the site and had a Royal Australian Engineers officer, Major Cecil Henry Foott, appointed to the local staff to safeguard Australian interests. Convinced that the huts would not be ready on time, and that Australian troops would therefore <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> winter on Salisbury Plain under canvas, Chauvel persuaded the High Commissioner for Australia in London, former Prime Minister Sir George Reid, to approach Lord Kitchener with an alternate plan of diverting the AIF to Egypt, which was done. Accompanied by Major Thomas Blamey, Chauvel sailed for Egypt on the ocean liner [...] on 28 November 1914, arriving at Port Said on 10 December 1914.|$|E

2500|$|The {{position}} from a 1995 game between Andrei Kharlov and Alexander Morozevich {{is one in}} which the Tarrasch rule does not apply (for Black) [...] [...] The move 1...Rb7 would be in accordance with the Tarrasch rule, but 1... Re5 is the correct method because White's king is cut off from the pawn, White will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> lot of time activating his rook, and by that time the black king {{will be able to get}} over to the queenside. [...] The rule still applies for White, however, and the game continued: ...|$|E
2500|$|In a September 2013 press release, Herrera Beutler {{announced}} that Abigail was getting healthier. [...] "I'm pleased {{to report that}} her doctors are happy with her progress and optimistic about her future," [...] Herrera Beutler said in a press release. [...] "Dan and I continue learning how to manage her day-to-day care while she gets healthier and overcomes her health challenges." [...] She added that she would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> lot of personal time {{taking care of her}} daughter, who {{is expected to be the}} first person in medical history to survive Potter's syndrome, but is hoping to return to the House Floor for key votes. The multimillion-dollar medical costs for these admittedly [...] "experimental procedures" [...] for Abigail, who will later require a kidney transplant along with lifelong immuno-suppressant drugs, is being covered by Medicare and the mother's congressional medical coverage. In early December, it was {{announced that}} Herrera Beutler's daughter would be going home from the hospital, nearly 6 months after her birth.|$|E
2500|$|Further {{development}} on the game's user interface began using the principle that the game needed to be both accessible and charming, being able to draw in new players and to be clear {{how to play the}} game. Unity is used as the game engine in the interest of speed and to make the game run smoother since the server is where all of the rules exist and calculations happen then the server tells the client what happened. Dodds stated that [...] "it's important that you don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> lot of time understanding the rules to play the game, the depth grows as you go." [...] Gameplay elements such as pre-made decks for each hero, deck building helps, and visual cues on which cards could be played were used to guide new players. Card text was written in a way so that a new player should be able to immediately understand the effects.|$|E

Somebody would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> good deal of money and labor on it first, and the result, which wouldn't be very apparent for two or three years, would be a little uncertain then. It depends on how much the man who undertook it wanted back to make the thing worth while." ...|$|E

The second part of the journey was necessarily begun in glowing heat, for it was most undesirable to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> night in the open country, and it was needful to push on to a fortified hospice or monastery of St. John, which formed a half-way house.|$|E

"And it {{is always}} worth while {{to make a little}} {{sacrifice}} for a good style of house," [...] said Mr. Gascoigne, in his easy, pleasantly confident tone, which made the world in general seem a very manageable place of residence: [...] "especially where there is only a lady at the head. All the best people will call upon you; and you need give no expensive dinners. Of course, I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> good deal in that way; it is a large item. But then I get my house for nothing. If I had to pay three hundred a year for my house I could not keep a table. My boys are too great a drain on me.
