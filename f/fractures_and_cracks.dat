The term is falling into disfavor and {{has given way to}} the more generalized description of <b>fractures</b> <b>and</b> <b>cracks</b> of the tooth, which allows for the wide variations in signs, symptoms, and prognosis for traumatized teeth. A fracture of a tooth can involve the enamel, dentin, and/or pulp, and can be orientated horizontally or vertically. Fractured or cracked teeth can cause pain via several mechanisms, including dentin hypersensitivity, pulpitis (reversible or irreversible), or periodontal pain. Accordingly, there is no single test or combination of symptoms that accurately diagnose a fracture or crack, although when pain can be stimulated by causing separation of the cusps of the tooth, it's highly suggestive of the disorder. Vertical fractures can be very difficult to identify because the crack can rarely be probed or seen on radiographs, as the fracture runs in the plane of conventional films (similar to how the split between two adjacent panes of glass is invisible when facing them).|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe pyramids of Giza in Egypt are the {{architectural}} heritage of ancient civilizations {{and for many}} thousand years served as great examples of ancient design, planning and construction solutions. Their scale is grandiose and the attempts of ancient architects to find perfect forms to ensure the structure stands for eternity are admirable. The initial geometry of the structures, their form, proportions and symmetry, was adapted to construction material and technologies available at that time. However, during more than 4500 years these monuments were damaged and partly destroyed; some pyramids were razed to the ground due to construction faults and seismic activity. The second largest pyramid at Giza is the pyramid of Khafre. This monument was not reconstructed and rebuild, therefore it was chosen {{as an object of}} our study. During the time period of 2009 – 2012 the photographic documentation of the facades of this pyramid was performed, fixing the location of fractures, cracks and displacement of construction blocks. The location of major <b>fractures</b> <b>and</b> <b>cracks</b> was verified in situ in 2012 and confirmed the validity of the interpretations. Several types of <b>fractures</b> <b>and</b> <b>cracks</b> were identified. One of the types indicates the detachment of stone blocks from the massive crack.

30|$|In summary, {{the failure}} {{mechanism}} and failure propagation of the Madaling landslide {{can be attributed}} to several factors including mining activities, topography and geological conditions of the slope. The mining activities created unsupported goaf areas that promoted development of <b>fractures</b> <b>and</b> <b>cracks</b> in the slope under compressive stress. The existence of soft rock layers in the slope created favourable conditions {{for the development of the}} fractures. During the failure propagation, the hill at the eastern flank acts as a resistant wall that crushed the sliding rock into fragmented particles and direct them into a narrow channel. The narrow channel provides a favourable condition for rapid debris movement. The combinations of these topographic conditions resulted in the long run-out distance as observed in the present study case.|$|E

In recent years, the number of adults seeking orthodontic treatment has increased, and the need for more esthetic appliances has led manufacturers to design various types of ceramic brackets [4].

30|$|The failure {{propagation}} {{of the slope}} was subsequently modeled by a three-dimensional discrete element analysis (PFC 3 D). A reduction factor of 0.3 {{was applied to the}} mechanical properties obtained from the laboratory experiments to account for deteriorations of rock structures caused by the <b>fractures</b> <b>and</b> <b>cracks</b> developed in the slope. In addition, residual stresses were mobilized during the debris flow. The mass movement during the landslide occurrence can be categorized into four stages, namely acceleration stage, constant movement stage, rapid movement stage, and deceleration and deposition stage. Although the simulation results could not explain the mechanism of shear strength reduction of the materials, the simulation successfully provided scenario-based run-out paths, sliding velocity and affected area. These information are useful for assessing the potential landslide hazard of another slope (Jieniangping slope) which is located at about 400  m away from the present failed slope and had shown signs of failures.|$|E
30|$|The {{results of}} this study {{revealed}} fast polarization directions were oriented parallel to the trench from the outer-rise to trench region, but NNW–SSE-trending direction in the seaward region. The magnetic lineation across the entire survey region in this study is oriented NE-SW (normal to the direction of line A–A′) (Nakanishi 2011). If the <b>fractures</b> <b>and</b> <b>cracks</b> formed at the spreading center during oceanic plate formation were preserved, the fast polarization would be estimated in the NE-SW direction. The present results, which contradict this expectation, thus indicate other mechanisms for creating anisotropic structure are present within the sediment across all surveyed regions and crust in spatially sporadic regions. An active seismic survey shows no significant P wave velocity difference in the crust around the intersection between line A–A′ and the northeastern segment of line E–E′ (Kodaira et al. 2014). Weak and spotted anisotropic structures obtained in this study may be linked to the small azimuthal differences in P wave velocity.|$|E
30|$|According to {{the test}} results and {{analysis}} above, {{it can be concluded}} that deterioration of these concretes were caused by different mechanism. Among the three aggregates, the most serious degradation was observed in limestone, mainly attributed to the formation of inner <b>fractures</b> <b>and</b> <b>cracks</b> of mineral particles, as well as the partial decomposition of calcite under higher temperature. As a result, the highest relative strength reduction was yielded by the limestone concrete at all test temperatures, although this aggregate had the lowest thermal expansion among the three groups. In contrary to limestone, the significant thermal expansion behavior of quartz phase and its phase transition when temperature exceeded 573  °C were identified to be the main reasons for the reduction of strength in quartzite concrete. Given its low quartz fraction (indicating low thermal expansion and low impact from phase transformation) and the high stability of the two plagioclase feldspars (albite and anorthite), granite concrete showed the lowest temperature dependence of mechanical properties among the three groups.|$|E

Several interesting constitutive behaviors, such as plasticity, are found in this model depending {{on the value of}} the damage parameter and on the form of the disorder distribution. We compare the constitutive behavior of global load transfer models, obtained analytically, with local load transfer models numerical simulations. The evolution of the damage is studied analyzing the cluster statistics for dry and continous damage fiber bundles. Finally, it is shown that quenched random thresholds enhance damage localization.
