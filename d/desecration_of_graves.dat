50|$|The {{societal}} funerary {{obligation to}} respect the dead {{made it difficult for}} anatomists to obtain bodies for dissection. It was legal in most US states to dissect executed criminals, but the number of people executed was insufficient for the growing medical body. Thus, the medical schools had to resort to sourcing cadavers from graves. Ostensibly, authorities were willing to turn a blind eye on the <b>desecration</b> <b>of</b> <b>graves,</b> so long as it involved only the graves of those who had been impoverished or poorly connected.|$|E
5000|$|In the mid-1850s, {{the villagers}} of Silwan were paid £100 {{annually}} by the Jews {{in an effort}} to prevent the <b>desecration</b> <b>of</b> <b>graves</b> on the Mount of Olives. Jewish visitors to the Western Wall were also required to pay a tax to the inhabitants of Silwan, which by 1863 was 10,000 Piastres. Nineteenth-century travelers described the village as a robbers' lair. Charles Wilson wrote that [...] "the houses and the streets of Siloam, if such they may be called, are filthy in the extreme.” Charles Warren depicted the population as a lawless set, credited with being [...] "the most unscrupulous ruffians in Palestine.” ...|$|E

5000|$|The UNCT said,From 2006 to 2010, {{at least}} 58 persons with {{albinism}} were killed, {{the majority of}} whom were children. In addition, there were nine cases of attempted murder and reports of the <b>desecration</b> <b>of</b> <b>graves.</b> ... Efforts {{have been made to}} prosecute the murderers. Tackling the national and international trade in body parts is also essential to ending the killings. In terms of protection, the Government has established special shelter centers for children with albinism. However, in the long-term, this measure results in the children's isolation from society and separation from family. Therefore, the Government should explore alternative ways of protecting people with albinism, including options that promote social inclusion and tolerance.|$|E
5000|$|The {{religious}} ceremony {{marking the}} start of a new month was held on the Mount of Olives in the days of the Second Temple. Roman soldiers from the 10th Legion camped on the Mount during the Siege of Jerusalem in the year 70 AD. After the destruction of the Second Temple, Jews celebrated the festival of Sukkot on the Mount of Olives. They made pilgrimages to the Mount of Olives because it was 80 meters higher than the Temple Mount and offered a panoramic view of the Temple site. It became a traditional place for lamenting the Temple's destruction, especially on Tisha B'Av. In 1481, an Italian Jewish pilgrim, Rabbi Meshullam da Volterra, wrote: [...] "And all the community of Jews, every year, goes up to Mount Zion on the day of Tisha B'Av to fast and mourn, and from there they move down along Yoshafat Valley and up to Mount of Olives. From there they see the whole Temple (the Temple Mount) and there they weep and lament the destruction of this House." [...] In the mid-1850s, the villagers of Silwan were paid £100 annually by the Jews in an effort to prevent the <b>desecration</b> <b>of</b> <b>graves</b> on the mount.|$|E

Some 30 years after her death, a string of messages appeared on her headstone, calling for the release from prison of Moors Murderer Myra Hindley, and making threats to Lesley Ann Downey's mother Ann West, who was at the centre of a campaign to keep Myra Hindley in prison.|$|R

5000|$|On 25 August, the Al-Shaab Al-Dahmani {{mosque and}} shrine in central Tripoli was bulldozed in broad {{daylight}} {{by a group of}} armed Salafists, including members of the security forces. According to witnesses, when the police came, they prevented people from approaching instead of stopping the demolition, while an anonymous government officer alleged that after a small clash they sealed the area to prevent violence from spreading. One of the assailants affirmed that the Interior Ministry had authorised the operation after discovering practices of worshipping and [...] "black magic" [...] at the shrine. According to witnesses, the Sheikh Ahmad Zarruq mausoleum in the port of Misrata was also destroyed. On 26 August, several Libyan government officials as President of the General National Congress Mohamed Yousef el-Magariaf, or Supreme Military Council spokesman Abdel Moneim al-Hurr condemned the demolition. Deputy Prime Minister Mustafa Abushagur stated on Twitter: “The destruction of shrines and mosques is a crime. Those who commit these crimes will be held responsible… I asked the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence to intervene yesterday but they did not do their duty to protect these sites.” The Grand Mufti of Libya Sheikh Sadik Al-Ghariani condemned the <b>desecration</b> <b>of</b> <b>graves</b> and holy sites, which he described as “not religiously permissible” and “a violation of the sanctity of the dead”. International non-governmental organizations (like HRW or ANHRI) and UNESCO also denounced the attacks.|$|E
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Media reports of <b>desecration</b> <b>of</b> <b>graves</b> and human remains {{and other types of}} mismanagement at cemeteries and crematories have inspired a debate regarding whether the federal government should take on a greater role in regulating the death care industry, primarily funeral homes, crematories, cemeteries, pre-need sales of funeral plans, and third party sales of funeral goods. The federal government has a limited role in regulating the death care industry, as most regulatory responsibilities are handled at the state level. Because of this, federal policymakers have expressed an interest in understanding the range of practices that are used by the states to regulate the various segments of the death care industry. Based on surveys of state regulators covering the various segments of the death care industry; and visits to the states of California, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, New York, and Texas; this report provides information on (1) the structures used by states for regulating the death care industry, and (2) the mechanisms used by states for enforcing their regulations covering the industry. The report also provides information on the resources available to help consumers make informed choices regarding death care transactions.

After a series of well-publicized comments, Walser and Bubis met and reconciled. A few weeks before his death, Bubis, already seriously ill, claimed that Jews could not live freely in Germany. Additionally, noting the <b>desecration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grave</b> <b>of</b> his Central Council predecessor Heinz Galinski in Berlin, Bubis requested that he be buried in Israel.

50|$|In December 1882, it was {{discovered}} that six bodies had been disinterred from Lebanon Cemetery and were en route to Jefferson Medical College for dissection.

In 2003, FAIR reported 29 incidents of assault or attacks against Muslims for that year, though they believe many went unreported. This included attacks on Muslim women and people wearing traditional Muslim clothes, as well as vandalism of mosques and Islamic centers.

One of the worst crimes happened when Ilan Halimi was mutilated and tortured to death by the so-called [...] "Barbarians gang", led by Youssouf Fofana. This murder was motivated by money and fueled by antisemitic prejudices (the perpetrators said they believed Jews to be rich).

5000|$|A {{perfect example}} {{of this kind of}} epitaph is that of the Egyptian monk Schenute; it is taken {{verbally}} from an ancient Greek liturgy.

O gracious God, the lover of men, forgive him all the errors which he has committed by word, act, or thought. There is indeed no earthly pilgrim who has not sinned, for Thou alone, O God, art free from every sin.The epitaph repeats the doxology at the close, and adds the petition of the scribe: [...] "O Savior, give peace also to the scribe." [...] When the secure position of the Church assured greater freedom of expression, the non-religious part of the sepulchral inscriptions was also enlarged. In Western Europe and in the East it was not unusual to note, both in the catacombs and in the cemeteries above ground, the purchase or gift <b>of</b> the <b>grave</b> and its dimensions.
