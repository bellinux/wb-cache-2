The NCA is composed of two civic-military committees that advises and console both Prime minister and the President of Pakistan, on the development and deployment of nuclear weapons; it is also responsible for war-time command and control. In 2001, Pakistan further consolidated its nuclear weapons infrastructure by placing the Khan Research Laboratories and the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission under the control of one Nuclear Defense Complex. In November 2009, Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari announced that he will be replaced by Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani as the chairman of NCA. The NCA consists of the <b>Employment</b> <b>Control</b> Committee (ECC) and the Development Control Committee (DCC), both now chaired by the Prime Minister. The Foreign minister and Economic Minister serves as a deputy chairmen of the ECC, the body which defines nuclear strategy, including the deployment and employment of strategic forces, and would advise the prime minister on nuclear use. The committee includes key senior cabinet ministers as well as the respective military chiefs of staff. The ECC reviews presentations on strategic threat perceptions, monitors the progress of weapons development, and decides on responses to emerging threats. It also establishes guidelines for effective command-and-control practices to safeguard against the accidental or unauthorised use of nuclear weapons.|$|E

It is well established that uncertainty is present in all aspects of transportation and land use planning. Sources of uncertainty range from technological advances to changing economic conditions to enacted policy to errors in data and model structure. While much research has been devoted to analyzing the variation in model outputs due to uncertainty, little has been done to quantitatively answer the more important question of how decision making will change based on recognition of this uncertainty. This paper aims to begin to fill this gap by evaluating how roadway investment decisions will differ depending on whether or not uncertainty is recognized.

We arc: nota developed country and the economic objectives of the new South Africa do not allow business to use the same business transformation model.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to argue that in spite of the widely optimistic held view on the effect of {{information}} and communication technologies (ICTs) in promoting the “knowledge society” in Europe and economic development elsewhere, evidence suggests that ICT's could be strengthening labour duality world wide. Design/methodology/approach – The paper addresses these issues by presenting a brief assessment of the “Washington Consensus” and the emergence of ICTs in terms of trade, growth and inequality in different regions of our planet. The paper also describes the effects of globalisation and ICTs on European economies. Finally, the paper presents the key finding and raises some policy implications to exploit ICT potentialities to ensure welfare systems in advanced economies and development in emerging countries. Findings – The lack of sufficient institutional mechanism of distribution in developing economies is not only making it more difficult for economic growth to translate into development but it is also favouring relocations of production, pressures to deregulate <b>employment,</b> <b>control</b> salaries and social expenditure in Europe. This feeds complex processes of social segmentation world wide. To meet this challenge Europe has no choice but to opt for the development of avant-garde sectors. However, measures linked to the development of the knowledge society may not be sufficient to maintain our welfare states in the current context of globalisation. Europe must play a more internationally active role in the design of another model of globalisation that would encompass social policies at a global scale as one of its pillars. Originality/value – There are very few studies of ICTs' role in the relationship between openness-growth-development-inequality. What are ICTs responsible for? What are ICTs' effects on development and welfare state sustainability...|$|E

40|$|We {{estimate}} local multipliers {{from the}} ARRA (Obama stimulus) bill using cross-county variation in expenditure. We use within-state variation, and include other demographic controls {{as well as}} a predicted <b>employment</b> <b>control</b> using an industry shift-share measure. We estimate a peak annualized employment multiplier of 1 job-year per $ 100 K spent per county resident and a 2 year average multiplier of 0. 75. We do not find nonlinearity in the marginal treatment effect of a dollar in stimulus spending, but do find strong evidence of heterogeneous treatment effects: the employment response is much greater in counties with greater excess capacity. In above median excess capacity counties, the 2 year multiplier is 1. 38. The level of spatial aggregation of the estimation has a large impact on estimation. Spatially aggregated multipliers rise to as high as 3. 28 jobs per $ 100 K spent per resident. Our smaller county-level estimates imply that ARRA created 1. 97 million jobs. A spatially optimal stimulus, targeted to high excess capacity counties, would have created 83 % more (3. 60 million) jobs. Our cross-sectional results are consistent with macro-economic models with state-dependent fiscal multipliers. In addition, they also suggest that the state dependency arises from the presence of excess capacity in the economy during deep recessions, and not solely due to the zero lower bound on nominal interest rate. Our evidence is also inconsistent with equilibrium models where a positive multiplier arises from a drop in wealth resulting in an increase in the labor supply. ∗We thank Owen Thompson and Ruchita Tiwary for excellent research assistance and the Institute for New Economic Thinking for generous financial support.

40|$|Throughout {{the nineteenth}} and twentieth centuries, Australian governments and their agencies, such as Aboriginal Protection Boards, {{generally}} controlled the wages, savings and benefits of Indigenous people. Indigenous people largely received no wages or were systemically underpaid for their employment. Any monies paid to Indigenous people were often paid into trust accounts. The accounts were generally mismanaged, sometimes fraudulently, and were largely inaccessible to Indigenous people. Indigenous people were also often excluded from accessing social security benefits, such as child endowments, maternity allowances and old-age pensions. These types of practices are referred to today as the 'stolen wages' practices.

40|$|The {{public sector}} in Romania is {{undergoing}} dramatic {{change as the}} state continues {{to come to terms}} with the post-Communist era, liberalisation encouraged further by accession to the European Union in 2007, and the impact of austerity measures implemented as a result of IMF loans in 2010.

Although this is undoubtedly the case, this paper shows how the situation regarding mobility of health workers in Romania is complex, involving multiple patterns of mobility - public to private, rural to urban, outward migration and circular migration. These are influenced by a potent mix of contributory factors, including the economic austerity measures (a public sector salary cut of 25 per cent, a recruitment freeze, and a limit on hospitals??? staff budgets); centralised and decentralised aspects of financial and <b>employment</b> <b>controls</b> (within which there are differing forms of hospital governance and funding); poor working conditions; and that this mobility is variable according to skill specialism.
