25|$|After {{painting}} {{a series of}} pictures, {{some of which are}} still in existence today, I was still dissatisfied and yet better prepared for experiments that would go deeper. It was in 1910 that, for the first time, I showed in the Salon des Indépendants and completely abandoned the salon of the Nationale, where there was nothing more for me to do. I sent to the Cours-la-Reine a full figure, a full sized portrait of the poet René Arcos, as well as two landscapes of the area round Paris, simple collections of masses in restrained colours. From that moment onwards, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> clearly now, my researches passed from the surface to the interior of the plastic problem. So 1910 brought another white stone to my life, as it would mark a stage which, if it was not conclusive, would at least be very positive. Above all {{in the second half of}} that year, when I painted the canvasses which would appear in the Salon des Indépendants of 1911.|$|E
25|$|Unless {{you have}} secret incriminating {{evidence}} against Furtwängler supporting your accusation {{that he was}} a tool of Nazi Party, I beg to take violent issue with your decision to ban him. The man never was a Party member. Upon numerous occasions, he risked his own safety and reputation to protect friends and colleagues. Do not believe that the fact of remaining in one's own country is alone sufficient to condemn a man. On the contrary, as a military man, you would know that remaining at one's post often requires greater courage than running away. He saved, and for that we are deeply his debtors, the best part of his own German culture... I believe it patently unjust and most cowardly for us to make of Furtwängler a scapegoat for our own crimes. If the man is guilty of specific crimes, accuse him and convict him. As far as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> <b>it</b> is no punishment to be banned from sordid, filthy Berlin and if the man now old and ill is willing and anxious to return to his exacting task and responsibilities he should be encouraged for that is where he belongs, right in Berlin...|$|E

Despite the laidback groove, West shows his vulnerable side, as he laments being loved and left." [...] "Devil in a New Dress" [...] contains lyrics about lust and heartache, with sexual and religious imagery described by one critic as [...] "part bedroom allure, part angelic prayer". Rap-Up called it a [...] "female-focused song" [...] and a [...] "soulful track, boasting a slow-rolling beat with a haunting vocal sample.” Alex Koening of Knightnews wrote [...] "over piano flourishes and a scintillating string section contain some of the funniest tongue-in-cheek lyrics about women Kanye ever managed: 'I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat/ I ordered the jerk, she said {{you are what you}} eat.' Kanye might be on his quest for love, but he still isn’t able to tolerate gold-digging girls who are only after his cash: 'And outta all the colors that are still up the skies/ You got green on your mind, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> in your eyes.'" ...|$|E

She has got a lovely voice and a super personality. She has experience as well." ...|$|E

[...] (Emperor Yizong responded to the warnings by stating, [...] "As long as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> once while living, I do not have regrets about dying.") [...] The ceremony was said to bring out great offerings by the households of Chang'an. [...] Emperor Yizong himself walked toward the relic and bowed on the ground in tears.|$|E

2500|$|Greenberg, {{who played}} left field in 72 games and batted [...]311 in 1945, {{helped lead the}} Tigers to a come-from-behind American League pennant, {{clinching}} it with a grand slam {{home run in the}} dark—there were no lights in Sportsman's Park in St. Louis—ninth inning of the final game of the season. The ump—former Yankee pitching star of the 1920s Murderers Row team George Pipgras—supposedly said, [...] "Sorry Hank, but I'm gonna have to call the game. I can't see the ball." [...] Greenberg replied, [...] "Don't worry, George, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> just fine", so the game continued. It ended with Greenberg's grand slam on the next pitch, clinching Hal Newhouser's 25th victory of the season. [...] His home run allowed the Tigers to clinch the pennant and avoid a one-game playoff (that would have been necessary without the win) against the now-second-place Washington Senators. The Tigers went on to beat the Cubs in the World Series in seven games. Only three home runs were hit in that World Series. Phil Cavarretta hit a home run for the Cubs in Game One, Greenberg hit a homer in Game Two, where he batted in three runs in a 4–1 Tigers win, and he hit a two-run homer in Game Six in the eighth inning that tied the score 8–8; the Cubs went on to win that game with a run {{in the bottom of the}} 12th.|$|E
2500|$|The PlayStation Move {{has been}} {{generally}} well received. Game Informer gave it an 8 out of 10, saying, [...] "The PlayStation Eye and motion controller are a killer combination for accurate and highly responsive motion-based gameplay, and we applaud Sony {{for getting the}} hardware right the first time." [...] Kotaku praised its accuracy, design, use of augmented reality and said that [...] "The Playstation Move is a intuitive, natural feeling way to play games and it brings with it not only a sense of increased immersion to already graphically immersive games, but {{a new way to}} play with your reality and a refreshing form of colorful feedback." [...] IGN gave the Move an 8.5 out of 10, noting that the launch line-up of games for the controller was insufficient though it summarized by saying [...] "At the end of the day, the PlayStation Move {{has the potential to be}} the best motion control system on the current crop of consoles." [...] Joystiq praised the Move, saying [...] "The hardware's great, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> being used in a multitude of really cool ways, but of course it's only as cool as the games that use it" [...] and that the launch line-up was not worth the purchase, though it believed that the Move would be worth the purchase in early 2011 due to a stronger line-up of games such as [...] and Killzone 3. CVG gave the Move an extremely positive review and awarded it 9 out of 10, saying that [...] "Sony's motion control gets beyond being a gimmick. We found ourselves constantly itching for 'one more go'." [...] The Guardian strongly criticized the Move's launch line-up, though it noted that the hardware was strong and that after playing with the Move it was [...] "very hard to go back to the relative inaccuracy of the Wii".|$|E
