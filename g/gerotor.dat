2500|$|A notable feature {{available}} in this generation was the automatic {{four wheel drive}} option called Quadra-Drive, which employed the New Venture Gear NV247 transfer case. This two-speed chain-driven transfer case uses a <b>gerotor,</b> a clutch pack coupled to a hydraulic pump, to transfer torque between {{the front and rear}} axles. The transfer case contains three modes, 4-All Time, Neutral, and 4-Lo. In 4-All Time, 100% of torque is sent to the rear axle in normal conditions.

5000|$|A <b>gerotor</b> is a {{positive}} displacement pump. The name <b>gerotor</b> is derived from [...] "Generated Rotor". A <b>gerotor</b> unit consists of an inner and outer rotor, with the outer rotor having n+1 teeth with n defined as a natural number greater than 2. The axis of the inner rotor is offset from the axis of the outer rotor and both rotors rotate on their respective axes. The geometry of the two rotors partitions the volume between them into n different dynamically-changing volumes. During the assembly's rotation cycle, each of these volumes changes continuously, so any given volume first increases, and then decreases. An increase creates a vacuum. This vacuum creates suction, and hence, {{this part of the}} cycle is where the intake is located. As a volume decreases compression occurs. During this compression period, fluids can be pumped, or compressed (if they are gaseous fluids).|$|E
5000|$|This style limited-slip {{differential}} {{works by}} using a <b>gerotor</b> pump to hydraulically compress a clutch to transfer torque to the wheel that is rotating slower. The <b>gerotor</b> pump uses the differential carrier or cage to drive the outer rotor of the pump and one axle shaft to drive the inner rotor. When {{there is a difference}} between the left and right wheels' speed, the pump pressurizes the hydraulic fluid causing the clutch to compress. thereby causing the torque to be transferred to the wheel that is rotating slower. These pump-based systems have lower and upper limits on applied pressure which allows the differential to work like a conventional or open differential until there is a significant speed difference between the right and left wheel, and internal damping to avoid hysteresis. The newest <b>gerotor</b> pump based system has computer regulated output for more versatility and no oscillation.|$|E
50|$|This pumps {{the oil in}} and {{increases}} the pressure in the nozzles to 15 bar maximum (217.5 psi). Usually a <b>gerotor</b> of the sickle type is used. Gear pumps are used frequently in oil burners because of their simplicity, stability and low price.|$|E

The company gets its name and logo design from the <b>gerotor</b> the company designed to compress and expand gasses.|$|E
50|$|A <b>gerotor</b> {{can also}} {{function}} as a pistonless rotary engine. High pressure gas enters the intake area and pushes against {{the inner and outer}} rotors, causing both to rotate as the area between the inner and outer rotor increases. During the compression period, the exhaust is pumped out.|$|E

5000|$|For the 1999-2004 Jeep Grand Cherokees {{using the}} NV247 {{transfer}} case, in [...] "4-All Time" [...] mode torque {{is applied to}} only the rear wheels under normal driving conditions. A <b>gerotor</b> pump is connected between {{the front and rear}} output shafts and senses any speed difference between them. When the shafts are turning at different speeds (wheel slippage), the pump supplies oil under pressure to a wet clutch pack. The clutch pack applies progressive 0 to 100% locking between the front and rear output shafts. For example, if the rear axle starts rotating at a significantly higher rate than the front axle, the <b>gerotor</b> pump causes the clutch pack to progressively lock, transferring torque to the front axle until both axles are driven at the same speed. The apply pressure in the clutch pack bleeds off slowly, which progressively unlocks the clutch pack and biases torque output towards [...] "rear only" [...] unless the rear wheels are still slipping. There is no center differential, so on dry pavement the front and rear output shafts cannot be locked without causing driveline binding. The [...] "N" [...] or neutral mode is intended for towing the vehicle. In [...] "4-Lo" [...] mode, the input shaft drives through a 2.72:1 reduction planetary gear set and the front and rear axles are locked together through the clutch pack. This same NV247 transfer case is the foundation for the Quadra-Drive system described below.|$|E
50|$|Hydraulic power {{steering}} systems work {{by using a}} hydraulic system to multiply force applied to the steering wheel inputs to the vehicle's steered (usually front) road wheels. The hydraulic pressure typically comes from a <b>gerotor</b> or rotary vane pump driven by the vehicle's engine. A double-acting hydraulic cylinder applies a force to the steering gear, which in turn steers the roadwheels. The steering wheel operates valves to control flow to the cylinder. The more torque the driver applies to {{the steering wheel and}} column, the more fluid the valves allow through to the cylinder, and so the more force is applied to steer the wheels.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the major}} {{advantages}} of the vane pump is that the design readily lends itself to become a variable-displacement pump, rather than a fixed-displacement pump such as a spur-gear (X-X) or a <b>gerotor</b> (I-X) pump. The centerline distance from the rotor to the eccentric ring is {{used to determine the}} pump's displacement. By allowing the eccentric ring to pivot or translate relative to the rotor, the displacement can be varied. It is even possible for a vane pump to pump in reverse if the eccentric ring moves far enough. However, performance cannot be optimized to pump in both directions. This can make for a very interesting hydraulic-control oil pump.|$|E
50|$|The block uses a {{bedplate}} {{featuring a}} perimeter wall with transverse webbings for durability and quiet operation at high engine speeds. The pistons {{are attached to}} fracture-split forged powdered metal connecting rods using semi-floating press-fit pins. A <b>gerotor</b> oil pump is driven directly from the crankshaft {{on the front of}} the engine. A timing belt is used to drive the valvetrain. Early production 2.0 L engines used a hydraulic tensioner to tension the timing belt. 2000 and 2001 engines used a mechanical spring-loaded tensioner that tended to wear out prematurely, causing serious valve and piston damage upon belt failure due to the interference design of the engine. 2002+ engines utilized a different mechanical tensioner. The water pump is driven from the timing belt, with the water pump housing cast partially into the engine block itself.|$|E
50|$|In a {{hydraulic}} installation, one pump can serve several cylinders and motors. However, {{in that case}} a constant pressure system is required and the system always needs full power. It is more economic to give each cylinder and motor its own pump. In that case, multi-pump assemblies can be used. Gear pumps are often supplied as multi-pumps. The different chambers (sometimes of different sizes) are mounted in one body or built together. Vane pumps and <b>gerotor</b> pumps too are often available as multi-pumps. Screw pumps can be combined with gear or vane pumps. Axial piston swashplate pumps can be combined with a second pump, or {{with one or more}} gear pumps or vane pumps (the gear or vane pumps often serving as flush pumps for cooling larger units). Axial plunger pumps of the bent-axis design cannot be combined with other pumps.|$|E
50|$|The 379 cuin L V8 is {{the main}} variant of the Boss engine. The V8 shares design {{similarities}} with the modular engine family such as a deep-skirt block with cross-bolted main caps, crankshaft-driven <b>gerotor</b> oil pump, overhead cam valve train arrangement, and bellhousing bolt pattern. In particular, the 6.2-L features a two-valve per cylinder SOHC valve train with roller-rocker shafts and two spark plugs per cylinder, as well as dual-equal variable cam timing. Just as notable is that they use a much wider 4.53 in bore spacing (compared to the Modular's 3.937 in), allowing {{for the use of}} larger bore diameters and valves. The 6.2-L V8 has a bore diameter of 4.0150 in with a 3.740 in stroke. It has lightweight aluminum cylinder heads and pistons, but makes use of a cast-iron cylinder block for extra durability since most applications for the engine will be trucks.|$|E
50|$|An {{electronic}} limited-slip differential will {{typically have}} a planetary or bevel gear set {{similar to that}} of an open differential and a clutch pack similar to that in a torque sensitive or <b>gerotor</b> pump based differential. In the electronic unit the clamping force on the clutch is controlled externally by a computer or other controller. This allows the control of the differential’s limiting torque, Trq d , to be controlled as part of a total chassis management system. An example of this type of differential is Subaru’s DCCD used in the 2011 Subaru WRX STi. Another example is the Porsche PSD system used on the Porsche 928. A third example is the SAAB XWD (Haldex Generation 4) with eLSD, it uses a common (electronically controlled via the vehicle computer network) hydraulic power pack to control both the longitudinal and transversal torque transfer of the XWD system. The same Haldex system is used on several other GM Epsilon based vehicles such as the Cadillac SRX etc.|$|E

40|$|<b>Gerotor</b> {{pumps are}} {{a kind of}} fluid power {{machines}} widely used in the automotive field, especially for fuel injection as well as lubrication. To improve the performance of these units, virtual prototyping is necessary to decrease time and cost related to trial and error. Within this research a simulation model for <b>Gerotor</b> units has been developed with the aim of predicting accurately the performance of a generic unit. The model can accurately predict the system behavior regarding mechanical and volumetric losses by considering real machining tolerances and their interactions. Ultimately, this model should help to design new generations of <b>Gerotor</b> units and to improve existing ones by improving their efficiency. To justify and refine the model, a test-rig which can enable measurements of rotor micro-motions of the gears of Gerotors is needed. This paper proposes an innovative approach for measuring micro-motions together with the design of a test-rig specifically conceived to allow such measurements. Reference <b>Gerotor</b> units will be put in a specially designed pump housing.

In this way, the micro-motions of the reference <b>Gerotor</b> unit can be detected. A data acquisition system will be created to collect the experimental data.

40|$|The {{technology}} of <b>gerotor</b> pumps is progressing towards cutting-edge applications in emerging sectors, {{which are more}} demanding for pump performance. Moreover, recent environmental standards are heading towards leakage-free and noiseless hydraulic systems. Hence, in order to respond to these demands, this study, which will {{be referred to as}} the GeroMAG concept, aims to make a leap from the standard <b>gerotor</b> pump technology: a sealed, compact, non-shaft-driven <b>gerotor</b> pump with a magnetically-driving outer rotor. The GeroMAG pump is conceived as a variable-flow pump to accomplish a standard volumetric flow rate at low rotational speed with satisfactory volumetric efficiency. By following the authors’ methodology based on a catalogue of best-practice rules, a custom trochoidal gear set is designed. Then, two main technological challenges are encountered: how to generate the rotational movement of the driving outer rotor and how to produce the guide of rotation of the gear set once there is no drive shaft. To confront them, a quiet magnet brushless motor powers the driving outer rotor through pole pieces placed in its external sideway and the rotational movement is guided by the inner edgewise pads carved on it. Subsequently, GeroMAG pump architecture, prototype, housing, methodology, materials and manufacture will be presented. As a principal conclusion, the GeroMAG proof of concept and pump prototype are feasible, which is corroborated by experimental results and performance indexes.

40|$|Accurate {{simulation}} models of <b>gerotor</b> pumps require knowledge of geometric features of these units. Instantaneous volumes of chambers {{as well as}} their volume derivatives lead to kinematic flow rate, flow ripple index, displacement. Flow passage areas between a chamber and the inlet/delivery volumes during a complete shaft revolution also need to be known. General analytical methods (integral-derivative and derivative-integral) have been developed for the calculation of geometric quantities of gear as well as vane pumps and will be reported in the paper with specific emphasis on <b>gerotor</b> units. The approach leading to these geometric informations has traditionally been grounded on a 2 D analysis of involved features. However, in the last decade, there has been a progressive and relentless development and use of 3 D CAD software that has led to the possibility of having at hand a virtual representation of these positive displacement machines. Accordingly, a novel method that requires the 3 D model of the <b>gerotor</b> pump is presented and the paper demonstrates how geometric features of the unit can be obtained. Main characteristics of this methodology are the use of parametric relations that define the relative position of the rotating gears, and the use of virtual components.
