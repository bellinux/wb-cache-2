5|$|Community ecology is {{the study}} of the {{interactions}} among a collections of species that inhabit the same geographic area. Community ecologists study the determinants of patterns and processes for two or more interacting species. Research in community ecology might measure species <b>diversity</b> <b>in</b> grasslands in relation to soil fertility. It might also include the analysis of predator-prey dynamics, competition among similar plant species, or mutualistic interactions between crabs and corals.|$|E

40|$|Increased selfing and {{inbreeding}} and, consequently, depauperate genetic diversities {{are commonly}} expected for alien colonies. We compared RAPDs data for native (southern Europe) and alien (British Isles) populations of hoary mustard (Hirschfeldia incana). This species is normally out-breeding, {{but it is}} capable of self- fertilization. Contrary to the common expectations, genetic <b>diversities</b> <b>in</b> native and alien populations were similar, without any strong evidence of decreased levels of genetic <b>diversities</b> <b>in</b> alien populations. A variety of factors may have contributed to this observation, including high variation in founding groups, founders originating from multiple H. incana source populations, and high rates of past and/or current gene flow. A review of other studies showed that this pattern of similar genetic <b>diversities</b> <b>in</b> native and alien populations was not unusual but has been regularly observed in other invasive plant species...|$|R

5|$|An {{interesting}} {{example of}} a bottleneck causing unusual genetic distribution is the relatively high proportion of individuals with total rod cell color blindness (achromatopsia) on Pingelap atoll in Micronesia. After a bottleneck, inbreeding increases. This increases {{the damage done by}} recessive deleterious mutations, in a process known as inbreeding depression. The worst of these mutations are selected against, leading to the loss of other alleles that are genetically linked to them, in a process of background selection. For recessive harmful mutations, this selection can be enhanced {{as a consequence of the}} bottleneck, due to genetic purging.This leads to a further loss of genetic <b>diversity.</b> <b>In</b> addition, a sustained reduction in population size increases the likelihood of further allele fluctuations from drift in generations to come.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the Imperial Census of 1897, the {{population}} of the approximate area of modern Odessa Oblast was 1,115,949. According to that census, 33.9% of the population was ethnic Ukrainian, 26.7% was ethnic Russian, 16.1% was ethnic Jewish, 9.2% was ethnic Moldavian, 8.6% was ethnic German, 2% was ethnic Polish, and 1.6% was ethnic Bulgarian. These numbers show that there was a high level of ethnic <b>diversity</b> <b>in</b> the region, and that no group had an outright majority.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopod fossils show great <b>diversity</b> <b>in</b> the {{morphology}} of {{the shells}} and lophophore, while the modern genera show less diversity but provide soft-bodied characteristics. Both fossils and extant species have limitations {{that make it}} difficult to produce a comprehensive classification of brachiopods based on morphology. The phylum also has experienced significant convergent evolution and reversals (in which a more recent group seems to have lost a characteristic that is seen in an intermediate group, reverting to a characteristic last seen in an older group). Hence some brachiopod taxonomists believe it is premature to define higher levels of classification such as order, and recommend instead a bottom-up approach that identifies genera and then groups these into intermediate groups.|$|E

5|$|Colts are {{assessed}} in their two-year-old {{year by the}} New Forest Pony Breeding and Cattle Society for suitability to be kept as stallions; any animal failing the assessment must be gelded. Once approved, every spring (usually in March), the stallions must pass the Verderers' assessment before they are permitted onto the Forest to breed. The stallion scheme resulted in a reduction of genetic <b>diversity</b> <b>in</b> the ponies running out on the New Forest, and to counteract this and preserve the hardiness of Forest-run ponies, the Verderers introduced the Bloodline Diversity Project, which will use hardy Forest-run mares, mostly over eleven years old, bred to stallions {{that have not been}} run out on the Forest, or closely related to those that have.|$|E
