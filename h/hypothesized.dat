5|$|Multiple X-ray {{sources have}} since been {{detected}} in the Andromeda Galaxy, using observations from the European Space Agency's (ESA) XMM-Newton orbiting observatory. Robin Barnard et al. <b>hypothesized</b> that these are candidate black holes or neutron stars, which are heating the incoming gas to millions of kelvins and emitting X-rays.

50|$|SLA {{has been}} {{influenced}} by both linguistic and psychological theories. One of the dominant linguistic theories <b>hypothesizes</b> that a device or module of sorts in the brain contains innate knowledge.

5|$|Crystals, though long {{admired for}} their {{regularity}} and symmetry, were not investigated scientifically until the 17th century. Johannes Kepler <b>hypothesized</b> {{in his work}} Strena seu de Nive Sexangula (A New Year's Gift of Hexagonal Snow) (1611) that the hexagonal symmetry of snowflake crystals was due to a regular packing of spherical water particles.|$|E

40|$|Recognition of {{isolated}} or connected spoken words or sentences including a large vocabulary {{results in a}} great amount of classification expenditure. Reducing this expense by <b>hypothesizing</b> the words embedded in the speech signal is the goal of the <b>hypothesizing</b> process proposed. The process bases on the acoustic sound patterns and is accomplished by a preclassification of significant phonems such as vowels and voiced consonants. The sequence of these phonems and their time distances within the speed signal is an appropriate criterion for <b>hypothesizing</b> and selecting of references from the lexicon. It is shown that this method can be applied successfully to isolated and connected word recognition on word and subword level reducing the classification expenditure by a great amount (120 to 2860 for isolated words). Results of the <b>hypothesizing</b> efficiency are presented for a 5000 word German vocabulary most frequently used. The hypoth...|$|R
5|$|The mirror neuron system (MNS) theory <b>hypothesizes</b> that {{alterations}} to {{the development}} of the MNS interfere with imitation and lead to Asperger's core feature of social impairment. For example, one study found that activation is delayed in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with AS. This theory maps well to social cognition theories like the theory of mind, which <b>hypothesizes</b> that autistic behavior arises from impairments in ascribing mental states to oneself and others, or hyper-systemizing, which <b>hypothesizes</b> that autistic individuals can systematize internal operation to handle internal events but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents.|$|R
5|$|In 1967, Carl Woese <b>hypothesized</b> that RNA {{might be}} {{catalytic}} {{and suggested that}} the earliest forms of life (self-replicating molecules) could have relied on RNA both to carry genetic information and to catalyze biochemical reactions—an RNA world.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{researchers}} <b>hypothesized</b> that smooth-edged holes {{found in}} the fossil jaws of tyrannosaurid dinosaurs such as Albertosaurus were caused by a parasite similar to Trichomonas gallinae, which infects birds.

Following Soskice (2007), I argue that coordinated market economies are less flexible with fiscal policy than liberal market economies. Multivariate analysis across 23 OECD countries demonstrates that VoC is more powerful than three competing theories: fiscal institutions, which <b>hypothesizes</b> more stimulus in countries with less restrictive budgetary rules; debt credibility, which <b>hypothesizes</b> more stimulus in less indebted countries; and political partisanship, which <b>hypothesizes</b> more stimulus in countries governed by the left...|$|R

5|$|Scientists {{initially}} <b>hypothesized</b> that acne {{represented a}} disease of the skin's hair follicle, and occurred due to blockage of the pore by sebum. During the 1880s, bacteria were observed by microscopy in skin samples affected by acne and were regarded as the causal agents of comedones, sebum production, and ultimately acne. During the mid-twentieth century, dermatologists realized that no single <b>hypothesized</b> factor (sebum, bacteria, or excess keratin) could completely explain the disease. This led to the current understanding that acne {{could be explained by}} a sequence of related events, beginning with blockage of the skin follicle by excessive dead skin cells, followed by bacterial invasion of the hair follicle pore, changes in sebum production, and inflammation.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scientists}} have <b>hypothesized</b> {{that the development}} of monothecate anthers and larger flowers (compared to those of the remaining genera in Durioneae) in the clade consisting of Durio, Boschia, and Cullenia was in conjunction with a transition from beetle pollination to vertebrate pollination.|$|E
30|$|We here <b>hypothesize</b> that {{deficient}} autophagy, in part {{related to}} global histone hypomethylation, {{may be involved}} in the increased osteoclast formation and activity during critical illness.

5|$|The Maudsley–Bethlem {{study also}} <b>hypothesized</b> that {{schizophrenia}} {{was caused by}} a mixture of many small traits working together. These endophenotypes could be used for diagnosis. Endophenotypes have been interpreted as a link between genes and the final behavior, acted on by the environment and chance elements, with biochemical and epigenetic influences changing the genome but not being passed on to children. Molecular-biological studies in genetics have referred to endophenotypes to explain genetic causes of psychopathology. The researchers also examined how schizoids, those with mild, schizophrenia-like personality disorders, were linked to schizophrenics. Gottesman and Shields extended the term to classes of mild psychological disorders in twins and relatives of schizophrenics. The researchers had <b>hypothesized</b> that schizoida in a twin was how a schizophrenia carrier gene, one in a non-schizophrenic still passing on a genetic risk, expressed itself. The twin study did not confirm this.|$|E
5|$|Transient global amnesia is a dramatic, sudden, temporary, near-total loss of {{short-term}} memory. Various causes have been <b>hypothesized</b> including ischemia, epilepsy, migraine and disturbance of cerebral venous blood flow, leading to ischemia of {{structures such as}} the hippocampus {{that are involved in}} memory.|$|E
5|$|A few ASD {{cases have}} been linked to {{exposure}} to teratogens (agents that cause birth defects) during the first eight weeks from conception. Although this does not exclude the possibility that ASD can be initiated or affected later, it is strong evidence that it arises very early in development. Many environmental factors have been <b>hypothesized</b> to act after birth, but none has been confirmed by scientific investigation.|$|E

5|$|According to Reuven Firestone, {{there is}} {{evidence}} of groups of Jews venerating Ezra to an extent greater than mainstream Judaism, which fits with the interpretation that the verse merely speaks {{of a small group of}} Jews. The book 2 Esdras, a non-canonical book attributed to Babylonian captivity, associates a near-divine or angelic status to Ezra. Mark Lidzbarski and Michael Lodahl have also <b>hypothesized</b> existence of an Arabian Jewish sect whose veneration of Ezra bordered on deification.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{theoretical}} framework {{for assessing the}} influence of risk in shaping the governance form in biopharmaceutical inter-firm relationships. In particular, we propose a multidimensional operationalization of relational and performance risk and, by following Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) and Real Options (RO) theory constructs, we <b>hypothesize</b> a relation between the aforementioned risk components and the choice of governance form. Specifically, following TCE reasoning, we <b>hypothesize</b> that {{a high level of}} relational risk leads towards more hierarchical governance forms, while, following RO theory, we <b>hypothesize</b> that a high level of performance risk leads toward market-oriented governance forms; finally, we <b>hypothesize</b> a moderating effect of each risk component on the other. We empirically test our framework through the analysis of 353 inter-firm relationships signed worldwide between pharmaceutical and biotech companies from 2007 to 2010. The results show substantive support for our theoretical framework. Furthermore, we find a significant moderating effect of the performance risk on the TCE relation between relational risk and governance forms...|$|R
