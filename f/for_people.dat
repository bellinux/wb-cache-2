5|$|<b>For</b> <b>people</b> with relapsed AML, {{the only}} proven {{potentially}} curative therapy is a {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplant, if one has not already been performed. In 2000, the monoclonal antibody-linked cytotoxic agent gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg) was approved in the United States <b>for</b> <b>people</b> aged more than 60 years with relapsed AML who are not candidates for high-dose chemotherapy. This drug was voluntarily withdrawn from the market by its manufacturer, Pfizer in 2010.|$|E

5|$|Before Hollanda struck Mauritius, {{most people}} were already {{residing}} at home, due to the cyclone striking during the Chinese New Year.

5|$|Chelation {{therapy is}} used in cases of acute lead poisoning, severe poisoning, and encephalopathy, and is {{considered}} <b>for</b> <b>people</b> with blood lead levels above 25µg/dL. While the use of chelation <b>for</b> <b>people</b> with symptoms of lead poisoning is widely supported, use in asymptomatic people with high blood lead levels is more controversial. Chelation therapy is of limited value for cases of chronic exposure to low levels of lead. Chelation therapy is usually stopped when symptoms resolve or when blood lead levels return to premorbid levels. When lead exposure has taken place over a long period, blood lead levels may rise after chelation is stopped because lead is leached into blood from stores in the bone; thus repeated treatments are often necessary.|$|E
