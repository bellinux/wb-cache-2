5|$|The {{painted turtle}} (C.picta) {{is the only}} species in the genus Chrysemys. The parent family for Chrysemys is Emydidae: the pond turtles. <b>Emydidae</b> is split into two sub families; Chrysemys {{is part of the}} Deirochelyinae (Western Hemisphere) branch. The four {{subspecies}} of the painted turtle are the eastern (C.p.picta), midland (C.p.marginata), southern (C.p.dorsalis), and western (C.p.bellii).|$|E
5|$|The {{wood turtle}} {{belongs to the}} family <b>Emydidae.</b> The {{specific}} name, insculpta, refers to the rough, sculptured surface of the carapace. This turtle species inhabits aquatic and terrestrial areas of North America, primarily the northeast of the United States and parts of Canada. Wood turtle populations are under high conservation concerns due to human interference of natural habitats. Habitat destruction and fragmentation can negatively impact the ability for wood turtles to search for suitable mates and build high quality nests.|$|E
5|$|There are {{fourteen}} extant {{families of}} the order Testudines, an order of reptile commonly known as turtles, tortoises and terrapins. The testudines {{are some of the}} most ancient reptiles alive, with only the tuataras considered more primitive. There are approximately 300 extant species and 97 genera of testudines, split into two suborders: the Cryptodirans and the Pleurodirans. The distinction between these two suborders is based on the mode in which they cover their head and neck. The Pleurodirans, also called the side-necked turtles, have long necks, and fold them sideways to align them with the shell. The Pelomedusidae and Chelidae are the only extant families of pleurodires. The Cryptodirans pull their neck straight back to conceal their head within the shell. The Carettochelyidae, Cheloniidae, Chelydridae, Dermatemydidae, Dermochelyidae, <b>Emydidae,</b> Kinosternidae, Testudinidae and Trionychidae are all cryptodires, although the ability to retract the head has been lost in the sea turtles (Cheloniidae and Dermochelyidae). A third order, the Paracryptodirans, are extinct.|$|E
25|$|Box turtles are North American turtles of {{the genus}} Terrapene. Although box turtles are superficially similar to {{tortoises}} in terrestrial habits and overall appearance, they are actually members of the American pond turtle family (<b>Emydidae).</b> The twelve taxa which are distinguished in the genus are distributed over four species. They are largely characterized by having a domed shell, which is hinged at the bottom, allowing the animal to close its shell tightly to escape predators. Box turtles have become popular pets, although their needs in captivity are complex. The females usually have yellowish, brown eyes and the males usually have red or orange eyes, but the most reliable manner to distinguish males from females {{is to examine the}} plastron: on males there is a concave area centered beneath the hinge.|$|E
500|$|The turtle's {{karyotype}} (nuclear DNA, {{rather than}} mitochondrial DNA) consists of 50chromosomes, {{the same number}} {{as the rest of}} its subfamily-mates and the most common [...] number for <b>Emydidae</b> turtles in general. [...] Less well-related turtles have from 26 to 66 chromosomes. [...] Little systematic study of variations of the painted turtle's karotype among populations has been done. [...] (However, in 1967, research on protein structure of offshore island populations in New England, showed differences from mainland turtles.) ...|$|E
500|$|The {{painted turtle}} (Chrysemys picta) {{is the most}} {{widespread}} native turtle of North America. It lives in slow-moving fresh waters, from southern Canada to Louisiana and northern Mexico, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific. [...] The turtle is the only species of the genus Chrysemys, {{which is part of}} the pond turtle family <b>Emydidae.</b> [...] Fossils show that the painted turtle existed 15million years ago. [...] Four regionally based subspecies (the eastern, midland, southern, and western) evolved during the last ice age.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Emydidae,</b> {{commonly}} called the pond turtles or marsh turtles, are {{a family of}} turtles. [...] Previously, several species of Asian box turtles were classified in the family. However, revised taxonomy has separated them to a different family. Now, the <b>Emydidae,</b> {{with the exception of}} two species of pond turtles, are entirely a Western Hemisphere family. The family <b>Emydidae</b> includes close to 50 species in 10 genera.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Emydidae</b> {{are most}} {{closely related to}} the {{tortoises}} (Testudinidae) and are included along with that family in the Testudinoidea. Shared features include a lack of inframarginal scutes, the shape and muscle attachment of the ilium, and the shape of the eighth cervical vertebra (biconvex). Within the <b>Emydidae,</b> two subfamilies were recognized along biogeographic lines. The <b>Emydidae</b> as understood today contain New World species (except Emys), while the former Batagurinae, today a separate family Geoemydidae, contain Old World species (except Rhinoclemmys). Osteological characters, such as the construction of the mandible and articulations of the cervical vertebrae distinguish the two families.|$|E
