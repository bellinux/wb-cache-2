The tournament {{marked the first}} time the 17-year-old Polgár was invited to compete with the world's strongest players. After four games she had two points. During her game with Kasparov in the fifth round, Kasparov gradually outplayed her and had a clear advantage after 35 moves. On his 36th move, the [...] World Champion reportedly changed his mind about the move of a knight, and moved the piece to a different square. According to chess rules, once a player has released a piece, the move must stand, so if Kasparov did remove his hand, he should have been required to play his original move. Polgár did not challenge Kasparov, in the moment, because, she stated, [...] "I was playing the World Champion and didn't want to cause unpleasantness <b>during</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> invitation to such an important event. I was also afraid that if my complaint was overruled I would be penalized on the clock when we were in time pressure." [...] She did however look questioningly at the arbiter, Carlos Falcon, who witnessed the incident and took no action.|$|E

It was, indeed, a filthy process in which I was engaged. <b>During</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> experiment, a kind of enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes were shut to the horror of my proceedings.

40|$|Image {{segmentation}} {{is generally}} {{defined as the}} process of partitioning an image into suitable groups of pixels such that each region is homogeneous but the union of two adjacent regions is not, according to a homogeneity criterion that is application specific. In most automatic image processing tasks, efficient image segmentation {{is one of the}} most critical steps and, in general, no unique solution can be provided for all possible applications. My thesis is mainly focused on Remote Sensing (RS) images, a domain in which a growing attention has been devoted to image segmentation in the last decades, as a fundamental step for various application such as land cover/land use classification and change detection. In particular, several different aspects have been addressed, which span from the design of novel low-level image segmentation techniques to the de?nition of new application scenarios leveraging Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA). More specifically, this summary will cover the three main activities carried out <b>during</b> <b>my</b> PhD: <b>first,</b> the development of two segmentation techniques for object layer extraction from multi/hyper-spectral and multi-resolution images is presented, based on respectively morphological image analysis and graph clustering.

6000|$|On New Year's day I dined in {{a public}} {{restaurant}} in Somerset,--in a strange land with strangers. But the strangers were not shy. Neither was I. There were about a dozen of us at table, and before dinner was half over we were as sociable {{as if we had}} been bosom friends from infancy. We even got to the length of warm discussion, and I heard some sentiments expressed regarding natives and [...] "native policy," [...] with which I could not agree; but, being ignorant on the subject at the time, I stuck to general principles. It seemed to me that some of the speakers must have been born with their brains turned the wrong way. This idea recalls to memory the curious fact that, <b>during</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> walk in Somerset, I saw a mounted Hottentot policeman wearing his helmet with the fore part to the back, because its rear peak was longer, and a better sunshade, than the front.|$|E
60|$|Probably {{the second}} failure-breeding fault, lack of perseverance, {{has its roots}} in the first, at any rate in my case.

Also, owing to the excellence of my memory and powers of work, I began very well, making money even <b>during</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> year. Then, as it happened, a certain case came my way and, my leader falling ill suddenly after it was opened, was left in my hands. The man whose cause I was pleading was, I think, one of the biggest scoundrels it is possible to conceive. It was a will case and if he won, the effect would be to beggar two most estimable middle-aged women who were justly entitled to the property, to which end personally I am convinced he had committed forgery; the perjury that accompanied it I do not even mention.|$|E

Then came a change {{that was to be}} expected: the appetite for news began to rise again, after this invigorating rest. I had to feed it, but I was not willing to let it make me its helpless slave again; I determined to put it on a diet, and a strict and limited one. So I examined an Italian paper, with the idea of feeding it on that, and on that exclusively. On that exclusively, and without help of a dictionary. In this way I should surely be well protected against overloading and indigestion.|$|E
