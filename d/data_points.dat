5|$|In statistics, maximum spacing {{estimation}} (MSE or MSP), or maximum {{product of}} spacing estimation (MPS), {{is a method}} for estimating the parameters of a univariate statistical model. The method requires maximization of the geometric mean of spacings in the data, which are {{the differences between the}} values of the cumulative distribution function at neighbouring <b>data</b> <b>points.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{analysis}} of the satellite communication relies on {{a limited number of}} <b>data</b> <b>points</b> that were analysed using innovative techniques that were only developed after the incident. The analysis has worked to determine useful information about in-flight events and the location of Flight370 at the 08:19MYT signal—believed to have occurred near the time of fuel exhaustion and thus is close to the final location of Flight370.|$|E

50|$|Just to {{illustrate}} what happens, suppose that y3 {{has the same}} sign as y2. Then, by the rule stated above, the <b>data</b> <b>point</b> (x1, y1) -instead of (x2, y2)--is used with the new <b>data</b> <b>point,</b> (x3, y3), because that earlier data-point is the most recently calculated <b>data</b> <b>point</b> whose y is opposite in sign {{to that of the}} new <b>data</b> <b>point.</b>|$|R

5|$|WASP-43 {{was first}} {{observed}} by the WASP-South {{part of the}} planet-searching SuperWASP project between January and May 2009. It was determined from the collected data that WASP-43 could potentially host a planet that transited, or crossed in front of, its host star as seen from Earth. Later observations by both the WASP-South and SuperWASP-North sections of SuperWASP between January and May 2010 yielded a total of 13,768 <b>data</b> <b>points.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{technology}} improved, {{measurement of}} depth, {{latitude and longitude}} became more precise and it became possible to collect more or less continuous sets of <b>data</b> <b>points.</b> This allowed researchers to draw accurate and detailed maps of {{large areas of the}} ocean floor. Use of a continuously recording fathometer enabled Tolstoy & Ewing in the summer of 1947 to identify and describe the first abyssal plain. This plain, south of Newfoundland, is now known as the Sohm Abyssal Plain. Following this discovery many other examples were found in all the oceans.|$|E
5|$|Data {{processing}} led to {{the acquisition}} of 24,943 <b>data</b> <b>points</b> that suggested that some body transited, or crossed in front of (and briefly dimmed), WASP-15 every 3.7520 days. Approximately eleven transits, full and partial, were observed. Use of the EulerCAM photometer at the La Silla Observatory's 1.2 m Leonhard Euler Telescope on March 29, 2008 provided further evidence for an exoplanet by better defining the transit's curve. Later, the CORALIE spectrograph (also on the Euler telescope) between March 6, 2008 and July 17, 2008 used Doppler spectroscopy to collect 21 radial velocity measurements. Analysis confirmed {{the presence of a}} planet that was later designated WASP-15b.|$|E
30|$|The {{distribution}} of each <b>data</b> <b>point</b> {{is to find}} out that in which grid cell the <b>data</b> <b>point</b> locates.

5|$|Later {{observation}} by both SuperWASPs in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres led to {{the collection}} of 13,768 <b>data</b> <b>points</b> between January and May 2010 and {{to the use of}} the CORALIE spectrograph at La Silla Observatory in Chile. Fourteen measurements using the radial velocity method confirmed WASP-43b as a planet, revealing its mass in the process. The use of La Silla's TRAPPIST telescope helped the science team working on the planet to create a light curve of the planet's transit in December 2010.|$|E
5|$|Phase Shifting Interferometry {{addresses}} {{several issues}} associated with the classical analysis of static interferograms. Classically, one measures {{the positions of the}} fringe centers. As seen in Fig.13, fringe deviations from straightness and equal spacing provide a measure of the aberration. Errors in determining the location of the fringe centers provide the inherent limit to precision of the classical analysis, and any intensity variations across the interferogram will also introduce error. There is a trade-off between precision and number of data points: closely spaced fringes provide many <b>data</b> <b>points</b> of low precision, while widely spaced fringes provide a low number of high precision <b>data</b> <b>points.</b> Since fringe center data is all that one uses in the classical analysis, all of the other information that might theoretically be obtained by detailed analysis of the intensity variations in an interferogram is thrown away. Finally, with static interferograms, additional information is needed to determine the polarity of the wavefront: In Fig.13, one can see that the tested surface on the right deviates from flatness, but one cannot tell from this single image whether this deviation from flatness is concave or convex. Traditionally, this information would be obtained using non-automated means, such as by observing the direction that the fringes move when the reference surface is pushed.|$|E
5|$|The {{landmark}} scientific expedition (December 1872 – May 1876) of the British Royal Navy {{survey ship}} HMS Challenger yielded {{a tremendous amount}} of bathymetric data, much of which has been confirmed by subsequent researchers. Bathymetric data obtained {{during the course of the}} Challenger expedition enabled scientists to draw maps, which provided a rough outline of certain major submarine terrain features, such as the edge of the continental shelves and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This discontinuous set of <b>data</b> <b>points</b> was obtained by the simple technique of taking soundings by lowering long lines from the ship to the seabed.|$|E

5000|$|... {{is a set}} of latent variables, one per <b>data</b> <b>point,</b> specifying which mixture {{component}} {{the corresponding}} <b>data</b> <b>point</b> belongs to, using a [...] "one-of-K" [...] vector representation with components [...] for , as described above.|$|R
50|$|When the new y-value has {{the same}} sign as the {{previous}} one, meaning that the <b>data</b> <b>point</b> before the previous one will be retained, the Illinois version halves the y-value of the retained <b>data</b> <b>point.</b>|$|R
5|$|One way of {{clustering}} {{a set of}} <b>data</b> <b>points</b> in a metric space {{into two}} clusters is to choose the clusters {{in such a way}} as to minimize the sum of the diameters of the clusters, where the diameter of any single cluster is the largest distance between any two of its points. This is preferable to minimizing the maximum cluster size, which may lead to very similar points being assigned to different clusters. If the target diameters of the two clusters are known, a clustering that achieves those targets may be found by solving a 2-satisfiability instance. The instance has one variable per point, indicating whether that point belongs to the first cluster or the second cluster. Whenever any two points are too far apart from each other for both to belong to the same cluster, a clause is added to the instance that prevents this assignment.|$|E
5|$|The {{increases}} of the 1630s corresponded with {{a lull in}} the Thirty Years' War. In 1634/5 the German and Swedish armies lost ground in the South of Germany; then Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria moved north. After the Peace of Prague (1635) the French (and the Dutch) decided to support the Swedish and German protestants with money and arms against the Habsburg empire, and to occupy the Spanish Netherlands in 1636. Hence market prices (at least initially) were responding rationally to a rise in demand. However, the fall in prices was faster and more dramatic than the rise. Data on sales largely disappeared after the February 1637 collapse in prices, but a few other <b>data</b> <b>points</b> on bulb prices after tulip mania show that bulbs continued to lose value for decades thereafter.|$|E
25|$|The term {{extrapolation}} {{is used to}} find <b>data</b> <b>points</b> {{outside the}} range of known <b>data</b> <b>points.</b>|$|E
30|$|Modify: In {{order to}} modify a <b>data</b> <b>point</b> over {{encrypted}} DISC, the CSP conducts an insert and a delete operation on the index at the server. Thus, the DO has {{to send the}} <b>data</b> <b>point</b> to be deleted and the new <b>data</b> <b>point</b> to be inserted. For the modify operation, the CSP needs to first locate where the point to be deleted lies in the index, then delete it. It is not feasible to insert the <b>data</b> <b>point</b> in the same location as the deleted point as their positions in the indexed tree may differ. Lastly, updates are propagated upwards till the root node of the tree.|$|R

5000|$|An LVQ {{system is}} {{represented}} by prototypes [...] which are defined in the feature space of observed data. In winner-take-all training algorithms one determines, for each <b>data</b> <b>point,</b> the prototype which is closest to the input according to a given distance measure. The position of this so-called winner prototype is then adapted, i.e. the winner is moved closer if it correctly classifies the <b>data</b> <b>point</b> or moved away if it classifies the <b>data</b> <b>point</b> incorrectly.|$|R
25|$|From the {{analysis}} of the case with unknown mean but known variance, we see that the update equations involve sufficient statistics computed from the data consisting of the mean of the <b>data</b> <b>points</b> and the total variance of the <b>data</b> <b>points,</b> computed in turn from the known variance divided by the number of <b>data</b> <b>points.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the {{mathematical}} field of numerical analysis, interpolation {{is a method}} of constructing new <b>data</b> <b>points</b> {{within the range of}} a discrete set of known <b>data</b> <b>points.</b>|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{if we have}} n <b>data</b> <b>points,</b> {{there is}} exactly one {{polynomial}} of degree at most n1 going through all the <b>data</b> <b>points.</b> The interpolation error {{is proportional to the}} distance between the <b>data</b> <b>points</b> to the power n. Furthermore, the interpolant is a polynomial and thus infinitely differentiable. So, we see that polynomial interpolation overcomes most of the problems of linear interpolation.|$|E
25|$|When each <b>data</b> <b>point</b> {{is itself}} a function, it can be useful to see the {{interpolation}} problem as a partial advection problem between each <b>data</b> <b>point.</b> This idea leads to the displacement interpolation problem used in transportation theory.|$|R
30|$|To {{determine}} if a <b>data</b> <b>point</b> belongs to multiple clusters, consider {{the distance of the}} <b>data</b> <b>point</b> to each cluster center. If the distance is no greater than the radius of the cluster, the point belongs to the cluster.|$|R
50|$|It is also {{possible}} to apply the above considerations to a single random variable (<b>data</b> <b>point)</b> x, rather than a set of observations. In a Bayesian context, this {{is equivalent to the}} prior predictive distribution of a <b>data</b> <b>point.</b>|$|R
25|$|In words, {{the error}} is {{proportional}} to the square of the distance between the <b>data</b> <b>points.</b> The error in some other methods, including polynomial interpolation and spline interpolation (described below), {{is proportional to}} higher powers of the distance between the <b>data</b> <b>points.</b> These methods also produce smoother interpolants.|$|E
25|$|DCTs {{of types}} I-IV treat both {{boundaries}} consistently regarding {{the point of}} symmetry: they are even/odd around either a data point for both boundaries or halfway between two <b>data</b> <b>points</b> for both boundaries. By contrast, DCTs of types V-VIII imply boundaries that are even/odd around a data point for one boundary and halfway between two <b>data</b> <b>points</b> for the other boundary.|$|E
25|$|The Whittaker–Shannon {{interpolation}} formula {{can be used}} {{if the number of}} <b>data</b> <b>points</b> is infinite.|$|E
50|$|The {{value for}} a {{specific}} step, that has been interpolated, is named a primary <b>data</b> <b>point</b> (PDP). Multiple PDPs may be consolidated according to a consolidation function (CF) to form a consolidated <b>data</b> <b>point</b> (CDP). Typical consolidation functions are average, minimum, maximum.|$|R
30|$|The {{quantity}} b_n {{measures the}} reduction in the error measure obtained by inserting a new cluster center at point x_n. It is clear that a <b>data</b> <b>point</b> x_n∈ R^d with the largest value of the b_n is the best candidate to be a starting point for the kth cluster center. Therefore, we compute i= _n b_n and find the <b>data</b> <b>point</b> x_n∈ R^d such that b_n=i. This <b>data</b> <b>point</b> is selected {{as a starting point for}} the kth cluster center.|$|R
