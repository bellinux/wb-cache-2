5|$|Green {{began his}} mission in June 1968, {{at the age}} of 53, {{initially}} in Harrow on Saturdays, becoming a full-time human billboard six months later on Oxford Street. He cycled there from Northolt with a sandwich board attached to the bicycle, a journey of 12 miles (19 km) that could take up to two <b>hours,</b> <b>until</b> he was given a bus pass when he turned 65.|$|E
5|$|Lions {{spend much}} of their time resting and are {{inactive}} for about 20hours per day. Although lions can be active at any time, their activity generally peaks after dusk with a period of socialising, grooming, and defecating. Intermittent bursts of activity follow through the night <b>hours</b> <b>until</b> dawn, when hunting most often takes place. They spend an average of two hours a day walking and 50minutes eating.|$|E
5|$|Adding to {{the chaos}} were {{fears of a}} {{potential}} second explosion. A cloud of steam shot out of ventilators at the ammunition magazine at Wellington Barracks as naval personnel extinguished a fire by the magazine. While the fire was quickly put out, the cloud was seen from blocks away and quickly led to rumours that another explosion was imminent. Uniformed officers ordered everyone away from the area. As the rumour spread across the city, many families fled their homes. The confusion hampered efforts for over two <b>hours</b> <b>until</b> fears were dispelled by about noon. However, many rescuers ignored the evacuation and naval rescue parties continued working uninterrupted at the harbour.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the arms}} of the encirclement had now made contact, the Allies were not yet astride Seventh Army's escape route in any great {{strength}} and their positions came under frenzied assault. During the day an armoured column from the 2nd Panzer Division broke through the Canadians in St. Lambert, capturing half the village and maintaining an open road for six <b>hours</b> <b>until</b> being forced out. Many Germans escaped along this route and numerous small parties infiltrated on foot through to the River Dives during the night.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} that Whetstone had reached Hispaniola, Du Casse had already departed. Benbow's force {{subsequently}} sighted the French on 19 August, sailing off Cape Santa Marta. The French had three transports and four warships carrying between 68 and 70 guns, while Benbow commanded seven ships carrying between 50 and 70 guns. The English forces were heavily scattered, and the light winds meant that they were slow to regroup. They did not achieve a form of collective order until four in the afternoon, after which a partial engagement was fought, lasting about two <b>hours,</b> <b>until</b> nightfall caused the fleets to temporarily break off.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton. Kevin Spacey met Byrne at a {{party and}} asked him to do the film. He read the {{screenplay}} and turned it down, thinking that the filmmakers could not pull it off. Byrne met screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie and Singer and was impressed by the latter's vision for the film. However, Byrne was also dealing with some personal problems at the time and backed out for 24 <b>hours</b> <b>until</b> the filmmakers agreed to shoot the film in Los Angeles, where the actor lived, and make it in five weeks.|$|E

5|$|On 1 March 1953, Stalin {{suffered}} a massive stroke, apparently on rising after sleep. Stalin had left orders {{not to be}} disturbed, and it was twelve <b>hours</b> <b>until</b> his condition was discovered. Even as terrified doctors attempted treatment, Khrushchev and his colleagues engaged in intense discussion as to the new government. On 5 March, Stalin died. As Khrushchev and other high officials stood weeping by Stalin's bedside, Beria raced from the room, shouting for his car.|$|E
5|$|On 19 December 1914, near Givenchy, {{during a}} night attack, Lt. Bruce was {{in command of}} a small party which {{captured}} one of the enemy's trenches. In spite of being severely wounded in the neck, he {{walked up and down}} the trench, encouraging his men to hold on against several counter-attacks for some <b>hours</b> <b>until</b> killed. The fire from rifles and bombs was very heavy all day, and it was due to the skilful disposition made, and the example and encouragement shown by Lt. Bruce that his men were able to hold out until dusk, when the trench was finally captured by the enemy.|$|E
5|$|On his deathbed, Hamilton {{asked the}} Episcopal Bishop of New York, Benjamin Moore, {{to give him}} holy communion. Moore {{initially}} declined to do so, on two grounds: that {{to participate in a}} duel was a mortal sin, and that Hamilton, although undoubtedly sincere in his faith, was {{not a member of the}} Episcopalian denomination. After leaving, Moore was persuaded to return that afternoon by the urgent pleas of Hamilton's friends, and upon receiving Hamilton's solemn assurance that he repented for his part in the duel, Moore gave him communion. Bishop Moore returned the next morning, stayed with Hamilton for several <b>hours</b> <b>until</b> his death, and conducted the funeral service at Trinity Church.|$|E

5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of September3, 2007, a malicious fire was set {{in the base of}} the Webster Sycamore's trunk. The fire burned up through the hollow center of the tree's hollow bole. The Webster Springs Fire Department, Webster County Sheriff's Department, and the West Virginia Division of Forestry provided a joint response to the fire, and remained on the scene for several <b>hours</b> <b>until</b> the flames were out. The tree survived the blaze but suffered irreparable damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{crew was}} ordered to abandon ship after about forty minutes of the {{bombardment}} using the only remaining operable motor lifeboat of the three stowed on board. One officer and four enlisted men were injured, {{but no one was}} killed. The Turks continued their bombardment for five <b>hours</b> <b>until</b> Ben-my-Chree listed to starboard and sank in shallow water. Later in the day, the captain and the chief engineer returned to the wreck to rescue the ship's mascots, a cat and dog which had both survived the attack.|$|E
5|$|The second sit-in {{occurred}} on Thursday, February 18, {{when more than}} 200 students entered Woolworths, S. H. Kress, McClellan, and Grants. The lunch counters were immediately closed. The students remained for {{about half an hour}} and then left, again without incident. The third sit-in {{occurred on}} February 20 when about 350 students entered the previous four stores and the downtown Walgreens drugstore. As the students sat at the counters, crowds of white youths gathered in several of the stores. Police kept a watchful eye on all five locations, but no incidents of violence occurred. The students remained for nearly three <b>hours</b> <b>until</b> adjourning to a mass meeting at the First Baptist Church.|$|E

5|$|After being {{classified}} as a hurricane, Karl gradually strengthened, and its circulation became more distinguished from the surrounding cloudiness. A trough that emerged from North America steered the hurricane eastward, and on November 26, it reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 85mph (140km/h) and a central barometric pressure reading of 985 mbar (hPa; 29.09 inHg). Karl maintained this strength for approximately 18 <b>hours</b> <b>until</b> beginning to weaken slightly as it accelerated towards the northeast. On November 27, the storm's eye became more ragged as the cyclone passed within 230miles (370km) of the Azores and started {{to show signs of}} deterioration. The trough over the North Atlantic developed into the dominant low pressure area, and Karl turned northward around its periphery. It merged with another approaching system and was declared dissipated by November 28.|$|E
5|$|By 17 August the encirclement was incomplete. The 1st Polish Armoured Division, {{part of the}} First Canadian Army, {{was divided}} into three battlegroups and ordered to make a wide sweep to the {{south-east}} to meet American troops at Chambois. Trun fell to the 4th Canadian Armoured Division on 18 August. Having captured Champeaux on 19 August, the Polish battlegroups converged on Chambois, and with reinforcements from the 4th Canadian Armoured Division, the Poles secured the town and linked up with the US 90th and French 2nd Armoured divisions by evening. The Allies were not yet astride the 7th Army escape route in any great strength, and their positions were attacked by German troops inside the pocket. An armoured column of the 2nd Panzer Division broke through the Canadians in St. Lambert, took half the village and kept a road open for six <b>hours</b> <b>until</b> nightfall. Many Germans escaped, and small parties made their way through to the Dives during the night.|$|E
5|$|Chief Gunner's Mate Michael B. Wallrath, who had {{assisted}} in lowering three lifeboats while he remained on board, jumped overboard after seeing {{to it that}} all the boats were away. Wallrath was pulled into lifeboat number 6 just before a wave capsized it and drowned two of its occupants. Lieutenant commander R. B. Vandervoort, USNRF, West Gates commanding officer, remained on board until he felt sure that the entire crew had departed the sinking ship. When he climbed up on the deckhouse to cut free a life raft and leave the ship, he discovered six men huddled on deck. Vandervoort {{was able to get}} the six on the life raft, but the suction caused by West Gates final plunge pulled him away and below the surface. After he managed {{to get back to the}} surface, he clung to floating wreckage for two <b>hours</b> <b>until</b> pulled aboard the very raft he had missed earlier. Vandervoort and the six men aboard the raft were rescued by one of Americans lifeboats at 06:00, after some 3½ hours in the water.|$|E

5|$|Communications {{with the}} outside world went through a single Forest Service line until April 1943, when it was {{replaced}} by five Army telephone lines. This was increased to eight in March 1945. There were also three teletypewriters with encoding machines. The first was installed in March 1943, and two more were added in May 1943. One was removed in November 1945. There were telephones in the offices, but none in private residences, as the Army regarded this as a security hazard. There were some public phones in the township for emergencies. Since {{there was no way to}} prevent the lines being tapped, classified information could not be discussed over the phone lines. Initially the phone lines were operable only during business <b>hours</b> <b>until</b> enough WACs arrived to man the switchboard around the clock.|$|E
5|$|In 1392 however, Carrouges {{was present}} {{for one of}} the more notorious occurrences in fourteenth century France; the first descent into madness of King Charles VI. As a chevalier d'honneur, Carrouges {{accompanied}} the King on campaign and thus was present when the Royal Army entered Brittany to hunt for Pierre de Craon, a noble who had fled Paris following a failed attempt to murder Olivier de Clisson, Constable of France. As the army passed Le Mans on 8 August 1392, a loud noise within his entourage startled the French King, who believing himself to be under attack, lashed out at the nearest person to him. The man happened to be his brother Louis of Valois, who turned and fled from his brother's sword. Killing several pages who attempted to calm his temper, the King set off on full pursuit of Louis, leaving the army strung out across the countryside behind him. The pursuit continued for <b>hours</b> <b>until</b> the exhausted King was eventually subdued by his bodyguard, including Jean de Carrouges.|$|E
5|$|Many of Royal Oaks crew who {{had managed}} to jump from the sinking ship were dressed {{in little more than}} their nightclothes and were {{unprepared}} for the chilling water. A thick layer of fuel oil coated the surface, filling men's lungs and stomachs and hampering their efforts to swim. Of those who attempted the half-mile (800 m) swim to the nearest shore, only a handful survived. Gatt switched the lights of Daisy 2 on and he and his crew managed to pull 386 men from the water, including Royal Oaks commander, Captain William Benn. The rescue efforts continued for another two and a half <b>hours</b> <b>until</b> nearly 4:00am, when Gatt abandoned the search for more survivors and took those he had to Pegasus. Although aided by boats from Pegasus and the harbour, he was responsible for rescuing almost all the survivors, an act for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the only military award made by the British in connection with the disaster.|$|E
