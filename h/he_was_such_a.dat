When Bethe arrived, Sommerfeld had just received Erwin Schrödinger's papers on wave mechanics.|$|E

25|$|He {{finally came}} to be {{respected}} {{as one of the}} most intelligent cyclists ever, but when he died in 1987 he was still to a large extent one of cycling's greatest enigmas. Raphaël Géminiani knew him better than anyone and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> perceptive man that his comments are particularly interesting. He said that Jacques w{{as one of the most}} gifted riders of all time but this was hardly reflected by his record. He had won eight major Tours without once crossing the top of a mountain in the lead. His lack of offensive spirit made Géminiani mad with rage on countless occasions but he was always so incredibly stylish, absolute perfection.|$|E

He also was one of the founders of Zenshuji, a Soto Zen temple located in Los Angeles, California. Suzuki's father and Kitano had a tense history between them. Sogaku had trained with Kitano in his early Zen training and felt that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> high priest due to familial status and connections. Shunryu did not see this in Kitano, however. He saw a humble man who gave clear instruction, and Shunryu realized that his father was very wrong in his assessment.|$|E

25|$|In his 1914 book, Abenmasarra y su escuela. Orígenes de la filosofía hispano-musulmana, Asín opens by {{describing}} {{the evolution of}} Islamic philosophy and cosmology {{at the center of}} Islamic civilization in the East, in comparison with its later emergence in Al-Andalus (Muslim Iberia). A brief biography of Ibn Masarra (883-931) follows. There Asín posits the continuation of pre-existing Iberian culture among Hispanic natives who, following its conquest, converted to Islam. Because of Abenmasarra's father's client status (to his Berber mawla), Asín infers that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> Muslim 'Spaniard' (a muladi). Asín describes his affinity to Greek philosophy, i.e., neoplatonism, then notes the accusations of heresy against him, and that he early concealed his teachings. At that time the Muslim ruler faced severe political unrest, being challenged by armed rebels such as 'Umar ibn Hafsun; accordingly the Emir showed little tolerance for religious dissenters like Abenmasarra. Ibn Masarra felt compelled to flee, traveling to Qairawan and Mecca. Yet eventually he managed to return to Córdoba under the next Emir, and to set up his School which contained sufi elements.|$|E

[...] In {{an interview with}} The Believer, producer George Meyer said, [...] "Grimes's cardinal sin was that he shined a light on Springfield. He pointed out everything that was wrongheaded and idiotic about that world. And {{the people who do}} that tend to become martyrs.

500|$|As a manager, he was {{a strict}} disciplinarian, {{possibly}} {{a result of his}} military background.

He used to bawl players out for different things. I could take it, but we had ball players, when he'd get on them, they'd go into a shell, resented it, and didn't give him their best." [...] Another Monarchs pitcher, Chet Brewer, said that [...] "Rogan wasn't the best manager because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> great ball player himself. [...] He couldn't teach pitchers much, because he'd say, 'All {{you have to do is}} go out and throw the man what I threw'." [...] According to historian Phil Dixon, [...] "In Rogan's first few years as manager he was reluctant to pinch-hit for many of the veterans on his roster because they were his friends." [...] He didn't trust younger players, often inserting himself to pitch or pinch-hit for them. He sometimes treated rookies harshly. Eventually Rogan [...] "discarded his distant approach" [...] and became increasingly known for teaching and developing less experienced players.|$|E

500|$|Antonio Banderas as Alejandro Murrieta / Zorro: Despite {{claims made}} by several media outlets and Antonio Banderas, Banderas {{was not the}} first Spanish actor to portray Zorro. Spanish actor José Suárez was cast as Zorro in the 1953 film La montaña sin ley, and in the 1960s-70s Spanish actor Carlos Quiney (aka Charles Quiney) portrayed Zorro in three films: Zorro Il Cavaliere della Vendetta, Zorro Il Dominatore and Zorro la Maschera della Vendetta. Banderas was paid $5 million for the role. The {{character}} of Alejandro Murrieta was conceived as the fictional brother of the real-life Joaquin Murrieta, making the character either Mexican or Chilean. To prepare for his role, Banderas practiced with the Olympic fencing team in Spain for four months, before studying additional fencing and swordsmanship with Anthony Hopkins and Catherine Zeta-Jones. The three were trained by Bob Anderson during pre-production in Mexico, spending 10 hours a day for two months specifically on fight scenes from the film. [...] "We used to call him Grumpy Bob on the set, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> perfectionist," [...] director Martin Campbell reflected. [...] "He was incredibly inventive, and also refused to treat any of the actors as stars. They would complain about the intensity of the training, but having worked with him there's nobody I'd rather use."
