500|$|During {{this period}} the {{question}} of Judge's salaries also arose, and almost caused a constitutional crisis. As Permanent Secretary Schuster was tasked with ensuring that the courts ran correctly, and although the Judges were independent they were paid by the Lord Chancellor's Office. Although a Select Committee in 1878 had recommended that County Court Judges be paid £2,000 a year this increase had still failed to appear due to the economic hardships caused by the First World War. The increase was eventually implemented in 1937, {{but in the meantime}} High Court Judges had also been lobbying for an increase, as their pay had stayed at the same level since 1832. Schuster and Warren Fisher had produced a report recommending a pay increase in 1920, but again the economic hardship prevented their plan from being implemented. The 1931 [...] led to the government passing the National Recovery Act 1931, which reduced the salaries of High Court Judges by 20%. The Judges, who had been expecting a pay raise rather than a pay cut, were shocked, and six High Court Judges threatened to resign, with Henry McCardie accusing Schuster of having his salary almost <b>doubled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> twelve years. The Prime Minister and Sankey met to write a letter to the Judges demanding that they give in; as soon as Schuster heard about this he rushed to Whitehall to [...] "stop the madness". The protests from the Judges increased through 1931 and 1932, with several judges including Albert Clauson and Arthur Luxmoore threatening to sue the government. After negotiations between Schuster and the judges failed {{to bring an end to}} the crisis the section of the act cutting judges' pay was quietly dropped.|$|E

6000|$|So, {{the freight}} on these bars {{probably}} averaged {{something more than}} $25 each. Small shippers paid two per cent. There were three stages a day, each way, and I have seen the out-going stages carry away {{a third of a}} ton of bullion each, and more than once I saw them divide a two-ton lot and take it off. However, these were extraordinary events. [Mr. Valentine, Wells Fargo's agent, has handled all the bullion shipped through the Virginia office for many a month. To his memory--which is excellent--we are indebted for the following exhibit of the company's business in the Virginia office since the first of January, 1862: From January 1st to April 1st, about $270,000 worth of bullion passed through that office, during the next quarter, $570,000; next quarter, $800,000; next quarter, $956,000; next quarter, $1,275,000; and for the quarter ending on the 30th of last June, about $1,600,000. Thus {{in a year and a}} half, the Virginia office only shipped $5,330,000 in bullion. During the year 1862 they shipped $2,615,000, so we perceive the average shipments have more than <b>doubled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> six months. This gives us room to promise for the Virginia office $500,000 a month for the year 1863 (though perhaps, judging by the steady increase in the business, we are under estimating, somewhat). This gives us $6,000,000 for the year. Gold Hill and Silver City together can beat us--we will give them $10,000,000. To Dayton, Empire City, Ophir and Carson City, we will allow an aggregate of $8,000,000, which is not over the mark, perhaps, and may possibly be a little under it. To Esmeralda we give $4,000,000. To Reese River and Humboldt $2,000,000, which is liberal now, but may not be before the year is out. So we prognosticate that the yield of bullion this year will be about $30,000,000. Placing the number of mills in the Territory at one hundred, this gives to each the labor of producing $300,000 in bullion during the twelve months. Allowing them to run three hundred days in the year (which none of them more than do), this makes their work average $1,000 a day. Say the mills average twenty tons of rock a day and this rock worth $50 as a general thing, and you have the actual work of our one hundred mills figured down [...] "to a spot"--$1,000 a day each, and $30,000,000 a year in the aggregate.--Enterprise.
