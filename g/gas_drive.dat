50|$|This {{is present}} in the {{reservoir}} if there is more gas than can be dissolved in the reservoir. The gas will often migrate to the crest of the structure. It is compressed on top of the oil reserve, as the oil is produced the cap helps to push the oil out. Over time the gas cap moves down and infiltrates the oil and eventually the well will begin to produce more and more gas until it produces only gas. It is best to manage the gas cap effectively; that is, placing the oil wells such that the gas cap will not reach them until the maximum amount of oil is produced. Also a high production rate may cause the gas to migrate downward into the production interval. In this case over time the reservoir pressure depletion is not as steep {{as in the case of}} solution based <b>gas</b> <b>drive.</b> In this case the oil rate will not decline as steeply but will depend also on the placement of the well with respect to the gas cap.|$|E
50|$|The {{province}} of Alberta {{lies at the}} centre of the WCSB and the formation underlies most of the province. The potential of Alberta as an oil-producing province long went unrecognized because it was geologically quite different from American oil producing regions. The first oil well in western Canada was drilled in southern Alberta in 1902, but did not produce for long and served to mislead geologists about the true nature of Alberta's subsurface geology. The Turner Valley oil field was discovered in 1914, and for a time was the biggest oil field in the British Empire, but again it misled geologists about the nature of Alberta's geology. In Turner Valley, the mistakes oil companies made led to billions of dollars in damage to the oil field by gas flaring which not only burned billions of dollars worth of gas with no immediate market, but destroyed the field's <b>gas</b> <b>drive</b> that enabled the oil to be produced. The gas flares in Turner Valley were visible in the sky from Calgary, 75 km away. As a result of the highly visible wastage, the Alberta government launched vigorous political and legal attacks on the Canadian Government and the oil companies that continued until 1938 when the province set up the Alberta Petroleum and Natural Gas Conservation Board and imposed strict conservation legislation.|$|E

Solution <b>gas</b> <b>drive</b> behavior, especially in heavy oil reservoirs, is poorly understood. Experiments were performed in which pore-scale solution <b>gas</b> <b>drive</b> phenomena were viewed in water/carbon dioxide and viscous oil/carbon dioxide systems. A new pressure vessel was designed and constructed to house silicon-wafer micromodels that previously operated at low (< 3 atm) pressure. The new apparatus {{is used for the}} visual studies. Several interesting phenomena were viewed. The repeated nucleation of gas bubbles was observed at a gas-wet site occupied by dirt. Interestingly, the dissolution of a gas bubble into the liquid phase was previously recorded at the same nucleation site. Gas bubbles in both systems grew to span one ore more pore bodies before mobilization. Liquid viscosity affected the ease with which gas bubbles coalesced. More viscous solutions result in slower rates of coalescence. The transport of solid particles on gas-liquid interfaces was also observed...|$|E

30|$|There are two {{processes}} {{commonly used}} to develop miscibility during gas injection: (1) first contact miscibility (FCM) or (2) multi-contact miscibility (MCM). Where the reservoir oil and injected gas reach a single phase upon their initial contact at any arbitrary ratio, they {{are considered to be}} first contact miscible (Green and Willhite 1998). In most conditions, oil and gas cannot achieve first contact miscibility, yet they develop miscibility by means of continuous mass transfer between phases (Green and Willhite 1998). Multi-contact miscibility can occur in three different kinds of displacements: (1) a vaporizing gas drive; (2) a condensing <b>gas</b> <b>drive</b> and (3) a condensing/vaporizing drive (Zick 1986).|$|E

By analyzing the geological data and the development history, the bottom water breakthrough also played an important role, especially in slowing the pressure drop. The invading aquifer, which intruded into the southwest nose of the reservoir, resulted in an imbalance of the reservoir pressure, thus an imbalance of the production and water cut. At the end of this stage, the average individual water cut in the northeastern zone was less than 5 %, while the southwestern part was roughly 65 %.|$|E

30|$|Improved oil {{recovery}} processes using gas, {{is also known}} as capillary number increasing processes. This method is called miscible flooding. <b>Gas</b> <b>drive</b> is the use of energy that arises from the expansion of gas in a reservoir to drive the oil out to a well bore. There are two types of gas drives, namely condensing gas drives {{in which there is a}} mass transfer of intermediate hydrocarbon from the solvent to crude, and vaporizing gas drives in which mass transfer occurs from the crude to the solvent. CO 2, nitrogen and flue gas fall into this category. These methods are based on the principles of increasing capillary number, which means reducing the interfacial tension between the water and oil thus lowering the mobility ratio (Lake and Walsh 2008).|$|E
