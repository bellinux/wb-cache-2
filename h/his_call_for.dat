5|$|Sledd first gained {{national}} recognition {{after he}} wrote a 1902 magazine article advocating better legal and social treatment of African-Americans.

5|$|The state Democratic Convention met on February 22, 1867 in Frankfort {{and chose}} Helm and John W. Stevenson as the party's {{candidates}} for governor and lieutenant governor, respectively. Helm resigned {{his seat in}} the state senate to accept the nomination. Though his health was frail, he determined to canvass the entire state. He continued <b>his</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> an end to Civil War bitterness and proscriptions against those who had sided with the Confederacy. He won the general election over Republican Sidney Barnes and a third party candidate, Judge William B. Kinkead.|$|E
5|$|Willis renewed <b>his</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> {{an income}} tax repeal in the 1946 {{legislative}} session, but Democrats opposed the repeal and Republicans were split on the issue. The proposal failed {{by a vote of}} 36–60. Accomplishments of the session included better mine safety laws and stronger concealed weapons laws, and increased funding for black education. The war's end had brought additional revenue sources, and even with an expanded budget, the state experienced an $18 million surplus by the end of Willis's term.|$|E

5|$|In the 1944 {{legislative}} session, {{the rival}} parties fought to a stalemate over the budget. The primary issue was deciding who would control the state's sizable budget surplusthe legislature or the governor. In {{an effort to}} unify the two sides, Willis backed off <b>his</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> a repeal of the income tax; another legislator proposed the repeal anyway, but it was defeated. Two months {{after the end of}} the session, Willis called a special session to reconcile the educational items in the budget. Once in session, legislators approved a full budget. The vote to accept the budget was deemed invalid, however, because approving a full budget was not part of Willis's initial call for a special session. In response, Willis called a second special session, and the Assembly passed a full budget on June 16, 1944.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Qarase and President Iloilo {{attempted}} to fire Bainimarama, {{who was in}} Iraq inspecting Fijian peacekeeping troops, but their nominee for his replacement declined the position and Major Neumi Leweni said the Army remained loyal to Bainimarama. Bainimarama in response repeated <b>his</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> the government to meet his demands or step down.|$|E
25|$|In late 1985 minor race riots {{between the}} African {{immigrant}} {{community and the}} police broke out in London and in Birmingham, leading Powell to repeat his warning that ethnic civil conflict would be the ultimate outcome of foreign mass migration into the British Isles, and re-issue <b>his</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> a government sponsored programme of repatriation.|$|E

25|$|The {{tribunal}} was constituted in November 1966, and {{was conducted}} in two sessions in 1967, in Stockholm, Sweden and Roskilde, Denmark. Bertrand Russell's book {{on the situation in}} Vietnam, War Crimes in Vietnam, was published in January 1967, and included a postscript describing <b>his</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> this investigative body. The tribunal was largely ignored in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Moscoe's {{election}} to the North York Board of Control in 1985 gave him an automatic seat on the Metropolitan Toronto council, which was then a part-time body made up of representatives from six municipal councils. He supported several reforms to the council's operations, including direct election and increased powers of governance. Particularly notable was <b>his</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> the Metro Police Commission and Toronto Transit Commission to be governed entirely by elected officials, rather than by mixed bodies of elected officials and appointees.|$|E
25|$|In February 1321 Mortimer, Hereford and Lancaster {{agreed on}} {{an attack on}} the Despenser lands in Wales. Edward responded in March by mobilising his forces in Wales, demonstrating that he {{intended}} to make any attack on the Despensers {{an attack on the}} crown, and therefore treasonable. The king travelled to Gloucester and called upon the Marcher Lords to join him there; Mortimer and Hereford declined. Mobilising more forces, Edward marched on to Bristol, and repeated <b>his</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> the Marcher Lords to convene with him there in May. They again declined.|$|E

In 1998 and 2008, he supported relaxation of the then strict laws against pornography, arguing that pornography can have some social benefits, and he has criticised {{what he calls the}} body-shame phobia against nudism, suggesting that nudity may be natural and healthy for society.|$|E
25|$|The current Chief Scout of The Scout Association of Australia is Sir Peter Cosgrove, {{who is the}} Governor-General of Australia. The Chief Scout of {{each state}} branch had usually been the Governor of the state. In 2015, the actor Shane Jacobson was {{appointed}} as the Chief Scout of the Victorian branch. In 1942, Sir Leslie Orme Wilson, the Governor of Queensland, resigned as The Boy Scouts Association's Chief Scout of Queensland due {{to the failure of}} the Queensland Branch to respond to <b>his</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> reforms to its centralisation effort that led to the severance of the Mount Morgan Blue Boy Scouts.|$|E
25|$|Davitt founded Labour World in 1890; the {{newspaper}} {{was an early}} promoter of the British Labour Party. His support for socialism in his latter years {{was based on the}} premise that Ireland could only achieve independence with the support of the British working class. This, along with <b>his</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> land nationalisation, often made him much misunderstood in Ireland. But he remained an inspiration for many others, such as for D. D. Sheehan's Irish Land and Labour Association (ILLA), and years later Mahatma Gandhi attributed the origin of his own mass movement of peaceful resistance in India to Davitt and the Land League.|$|E

Goren continued to pray {{for many years in}} the Makhkame building overlooking the Temple Mount where he conducted yearly High Holiday services. <b>His</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> the establishment of a synagogue on the Temple Mount has subsequently been reiterated by his brother-in-law the Chief Rabbi of Haifa, She'ar Yashuv Cohen.|$|E

25|$|Ze'ev Jabotinsky's legacy {{was carried}} on by Israel's Herut party, which merged with other right wing parties {{to form the}} Likud Party in 1973. Likud has since acted as Israel's main right-wing party, and {{has been part of}} most Israeli governments since 1977. His legacy has also been honored to a smaller extent by Herut – The National Movement (a {{breakaway}} from Likud), Magshimey Herut (young adult activist movement) and Betar (youth movement).

25|$|The 1969 {{death of}} Barrientos in a {{helicopter}} accident led to a succession of weak governments. A coup was led by the military, only to see a countercoup led by leftist Juan José Torres. Alarmed by public disorder, the military, the MNR, and others installed Col. (later General) Hugo Banzer Suárez as President in 1971. Banzer ruled with MNR support from 1971 to 1974. Then, impatient with schisms in the coalition, he replaced civilians {{with members of the}} armed forces and suspended political activities. The economy grew impressively during Banzer's presidency, but demands for greater political freedom undercut his support. <b>His</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> elections in 1978 plunged Bolivia into turmoil once again.|$|E
25|$|Prior to <b>his</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> an election, Charest {{revealed}} his platform which included income tax cuts of about $250 million. In {{the last week}} of the campaign, Charest promised an additional $700 million in tax cuts—some of it coming for the additional equalization money from the 2007 federal budget; reduction of hospital wait times; improvement and increase of French courses at school; an increase of the number of daycare spaces; and an increase in tuition fees for university students ($50 per semester until 2012). The last measure was met with criticism from students' associations, and a more-radical student association, the Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante (formerly known as the CASSEE) had also considered a strike.|$|E
