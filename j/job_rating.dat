The unemployment of economically disadvantaged youth has been a problem of major dimension. Government programs such as those supplied by the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) services have been established to increase the employment of economically disadvantaged adolescents. Some programs produced positive results, but most youth job training programs reported negative or unclear results. This study investigated the effects of social psychologically based educational programs on specific job behaviors of economically disadvantaged adolescents. Adolescents, age 14 to 21, from a rural northern Illinois county participated in a CETA sponsored summer youth job training program. Two treatment groups were used: modeling/self-instruction without a moral decision making component, and modeling/self-instruction with a moral decision making component. A <b>job</b> <b>rating</b> scale was developed and piloted for use in measuring the dependent variable, job performance.

40|$|Why did rating {{agencies}} {{do such a}} bad <b>job</b> <b>rating</b> subprime securities? The conventional answer draws heavily {{on the fact that}} ratings {{are paid for by the}} issuers: Issuers could, and do, “buy” high ratings from willing sellers, the {{rating agencies}}. The conventional answer cannot be wholly correct or even nearly so. Issuers also pay rating agencies to rate their corporate bond issues, yet very few corporate bond issues are rated AAA. If the rating agencies were selling high ratings, why weren’t high ratings sold for corporate bonds? Moreover, for some types of subprime securities, a particular rating agency’s rating was considered necessary. Where a Standard 2 ̆ 6 Poor’s rating was deemed necessary by the market, why would Standard 2 ̆ 6 Poor’s risk its reputation by giving a rating higher (indeed, much higher) than it knew was warranted? Finally, and perhaps most importantly, giving AAA ratings to securities of much lower quality is something that can’t be done for long. A rating agency that becomes known for selling its high ratings will soon find that nobody will be paying anything for its ratings, high or low. In my view, that issuers pay for ratings may have been necessary for the rating agencies to have done as bad a job as they did rating subprime securities, but it was not sufficient. Many other factors contributed, including, importantly, that rating agencies “drank the Kool-Aid. ” They convinced themselves that the transaction structures could do what they were touted as being able to do: with only a thin cushion of support, produce a great quantity of high-quality securities. Rating agencies could take comfort, too, or so they thought, in the past - the successful, albeit short, recent history of subprime securitizations, and the longer history of successful mortgage securitizations. “Issuer pays” did not so much make the rating agencies give higher ratings than they thought were warranted as it gave the agencies a “can do” mindset regarding the task at hand - to achieve the rating the issuers desired, working with them to modify the deal structures as needed. That the issuers were paying motivated the agencies to drink the Kool-Aid; having drunk the Kool-Aid, the agencies gave the ratings they did. My account casts doubt on the efficacy of many of the solutions presently being proposed and suggests some features that more efficacious solutions should have...|$|E
40|$|La {{qualification}} désigne des procédés qui conduisent à des groupements et à des classements d'individus de manière à les différencier en les hiérarchisant. En définissant ainsi la qualification dans la relation d'emploi, c'est-à-dire comme rapport du travailleur à son travail, l'auteur réfute les distinctions que l'on opère souvent entre qualification du poste et du travailleur, tout comme la distinction entre qualification professionnelle et sociale. En particulier, la notion de qualification sociale qui s'est répandue à partir de son utilisation croissante dans le domaine de l'insertion socioprofessionnelle des jeunes et des publics faiblement scolarisés, s'est aussi appuyée sur une réinterprétation de la littérature sociologique relative au travail. Examinant deux versions principales (l'évolution professionnelle et l'insertion socioprofessionnelle des jeunes) et deux versions dérivées (les stratégies de recherche d'emploi et les transformations des savoirs) des usages de la qualification sociale, l'auteur tente de montrer tout à la fois les raisons de la force de conviction de cette distinction et s'efforce en même temps de réfuter la distinction entre qualification professionnelle et sociale. En s'appuyant sur les rapports entre travail formel et informel l'article montre qu'on ne peut distinguer des formations « socialisées » relevant de qualités comportementales d'une formation instituée fondant la qualification professionnelle. En effet l'apprentissage des rapports sociaux liés à l'emploi s'acquiert à l'école, au travail et dans la vie quotidienne. Les capacités techniques du salarié ou ses aptitudes à communiquer sont de même ordre et ne peuvent être séparées des modalités sociales qu'elles revêtent simultanément. En fait, la qualification se comprend comme processus social de classement. Distinguer dès lors une qualification sociale suppose l'existence d'un noyau technique extérieur aux rapports sociaux qui constituent précisément la qualification. Cette forme d'analyse participe d'une tentation à naturaliser les différences sociales. Mateo Alaluf, Kann man bei der Qualification technische Klassifizierungen von sozialen Klassifizierungen unterscheiden ? Die Qualifikation bezeichnet Verfahren zur Gruppierung und Klassifizierung von Individuen, um diese voneinander zu unterscheiden, indem man eine Hierarchisierung vornimmt. Indem der Autor die Qualifikation im Arbeitsverhältnis definiert, d. h. als Beziehung des Arbeitnehmers zu seiner Arbeit, widerlegt er die oft gemachte Unterscheidung zwischen der Qualifikation des Arbeitsplatzes und derjenigen des Arbeitnehmers sowie zwischen beruflicher und sozialer Qualifikation. Der Begriff der sozialen Qualifikation fand insbesondere durch den zunehmenden Gebrauch im Bereich der sozioprofessionellen Eingliederung Jugendlicher und Gruppen mit nur geringer Schullaufbahn Verbreitung, konnte sich aber auch auf eine « Neu » interpretation der soziologischen Fachliteratur zum Thema Arbeit stützen. Indem der Verfasser zwei Haupttypen (berufliche Entwicklung und sozioprofessionelle Eingliederung) sowie zwei Nebentypen (Strategien der Arbeitssuche und (Um-) Wandlung des Wissens) des Gebrauchs der sozialen Qualifikation untersucht, versucht er die Gründe für die Schlagkraft dieser Unterscheidung aufzuzeigen und gleichzeitig die gemachte Unterscheidung zwischen beruflicher und sozialer Qualifikation zu widerlegen. Dieser Beitrag zeigt, indem er sich auf die Beziehungen zwischen formeller und informeller Arbeit stützt, daß man « sozialisierte » (Aus-) Bildung, die auf Verhaltensqualitäten beruht, nicht von « institutionalisierter » (Aus-) Bildung, die die berufliche Qualifikation begründet, trennen kann. Die mit der Beschäftigung verbundenen sozialen Beziehungen werden nämlich in der Schule, am Arbeitsplatz und im Alltag erworben. Ähnliches gilt für die technischen Fähigkeiten des Arbeitnehmers oder seiner Kommunikationskompetenz, die nicht von den sie umfaßenden sozialen Modalitäten getrennt werden können. Tatsächlich ist Qualifikation als sozialer Klassifizierungsprozeß zu verstehen. Wenn man eine soziale Qualifikation abgrenzt, unterstellt man damit die Existenz eines technischen Kerns außerhalb der sozialen Beziehungen, die aber gerade die Qualifikation begründen. Diese Form der Analyse versucht die sozialen Beziehungen so zu behandeln, als wären sie natürliche Beziehungen. Mateo Alaluf, Is {{it possible}} to distinguish between technical and social classifications of qualification ? « Qualification » designates processes which give rise to grouping and classification of individuals so as to differentiate between them by hierarchizing them. By thus defining qualification in the work relationship, i. e., {{the relationship between the}} worker and his work, the author refutes distinctions that are often made between the <b>job</b> <b>rating</b> and the worker's rating, {{at the same time as}} the distinction between professional and social qualifications. In particular, the concept of qualification, which has spread from its growing use in the field of socioprofessional integration of young people and those with little academic background, is also based on a reinterpretation of sociological literature concerned with employment. By examining two main versions (the professional development and socio-professional integration of young people) and two secondary versions (job search strategies and transformation of knowledge) of the practices of social qualification, the author attempts to show the reasons why this distinction is convincing, while at the same time refuting the distinction between professional and social qualifications. Using as a base the relationships between formal and informal work, the article shows that we cannot distinguish between « socialized » training depending on behavioural qualities and organized training laying the foundations of a professional qualification. Social relationships linked to employment are learnt at school, at work, and in daily life. The technical abilities of the salaried worker, or his capability to communicate, are of the same type, and cannot be separated from the social aspect which they assume at the same time. In fact, qualification may be understood as a social classification process. Therefore, to distinguish a social qualification assumes the existence of a technical nucleus external to the social relationships making up a qualification. This form of analysis is part of a temptation to naturalize social differences. Alaluf Mateo. Peut-on distinguer les classements techniques des classements sociaux de la qualification ?.
