40|$|In {{this study}} consumers’ {{perception}} of, and purchase intention for <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>foods</b> {{were examined in}} the city center of Hatay. The data of the 343 surveys were collected by using the face to face interview method. The data were analyzed by means of Likert Scale, and Spearman Correlation Analysis. According to the survey results, consumers’ risk perceptions about <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>foods</b> are quite high. Consumers don’t willingly purchase <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>foods,</b> and they intend to consume foods grown in traditional methods. High risk perceptions have a determining role on consumers’ views about <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>foods</b> and their purchase intention for them.

40|$|Abstract. Both at {{home and}} abroad {{concerns}} about <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>foods</b> have disrupted food markets and raised a number of problems for international trade. This paper addresses the issue of labeling <b>foods</b> produced using <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> ingredients from an economic perspective. The wide range of consumer attitudes with respect to <b>food</b> safety and <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>foods</b> highlights the need for research into how consumer attitudes toward food are established. Consumer attitudes toward <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>foods</b> span the distance from profound fear to unflinching acceptance- a divergence in attitudes that can not be explained by variations in preferences. The debate generated by <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>foods</b> also focuses attention on how consumer attitudes influence agricultural and food markets. In the case of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>foods,</b> a seemingly small demand for non-genetically <b>modified</b> <b>foods</b> has triggered a number of market changes. For example, a number of food manufacturers have begun to market non-genetically <b>modified</b> <b>food</b> products, and a number of elevators and processors have begun to segregate <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> varieties of corn and soybeans from conventional varieties. We present a simple economic model showing how introduction of labeling for <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>foods</b> can affect food markets, and the role that social preferences and attitudes in place at the time labeling is introduced can influence the outcome of labeling policies. We examine how consumer attitudes toward food are established and how consumer attitudes influence market structure. The implications of labeling for international trade in food products is also discussed. 1...|$|R
5|$|Agriculture {{accounts}} for just under 1% of GDP, yet the United States is the world's top producer {{of corn and}} soybeans. The National Agricultural Statistics Service maintains agricultural statistics for products that include peanuts, oats, rye, wheat, rice, cotton, corn, barley, hay, sunflowers, and oilseeds. In addition, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides livestock statistics regarding beef, poultry, pork, and dairy products. The country is the primary developer and grower of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>food,</b> representing half of the world's biotech crops.|$|E
5|$|Before 1995, no peer-reviewed {{studies had}} been {{published}} investigating the safety of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>food</b> using human or animal feeding trials. In 1995 the Scottish Agriculture Environment and Fisheries Department commissioned a £1.6 million three-year research study to assess the safety of genetically engineered Desiree Red potatoes. The potatoes had been developed by biochemist John Gatehouse at Cambridge Agricultural Genetics (later renamed Axis Genetics) and had recently completed two years of field trials at Rothamsted Experimental Station. The GNA gene from the Galanthus (snowdrop) plant was inserted into the potato, allowing the GNA lectin protein to be synthesised. This lectin {{has been shown to}} be toxic to some insects.|$|E
5|$|Confusion reigned {{over just}} what {{experiments}} had been conducted. Pusztai had mentioned {{two lines of}} genetically modified potatoes, meaning the two GNA lines, and this was reported by the media. The Rowett institute mistakenly assumed the media {{was talking about a}} second line transformed with concanavalin A (ConA), a Jack Bean lectin that is toxic to mammals. Transgenic ConA Potatoes had been developed, but had never been tested. Two press releases issued by the Rowett Institute on the 10th and 11th praised Pusztai's research and supported increased safety tests on <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>food.</b> The press releases also said that the potatoes were modified with ConA, adding to the confusion. Pusztai claimed that he had not seen the press releases before they went out and had no opportunity to correct the mistake. James says that he drafted it and Pusztai rewrote one section, but did not see the final copy. The mistaken belief that the ConA gene was inserted into the potato led scientist Sir Robert May and Agricultural Minister Jack Cunningham to release statements to the media saying that the findings were not surprising, as a known poison had been added to the potato. Some scientists still dismiss Pusztai's work over this error.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{reported here}} aimed {{to investigate the}} effects {{of different types of}} information about <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>foods</b> on both consumer attitudes towards genetic modification and their tendency to choose <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> products (compared to more traditionally manufactured alternatives). The impact of information strategy (balanced, or product specific), attributed information source (The “European Association of Consumers”, the “European Association of Industry” or the “European Commission”) and type of product (yoghurt or beer) were systematically examined in the four European countries involved in the research. The effects of a classical advertising approach were also examined in Denmark and Germany. The results indicated that • Providing information does not increase acceptance of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>foods.</b> The reverse was found to be true. • In all countries, consumers tended to select non-genetically modified products. Cross-national differences related to type of product were not very pronounced. • Those respondents who had positive prior attitudes towards <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>foods</b> were more likely to select <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>foods.</b> These attitudes were not influenced by information provision. • The form of information strategy about <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>foods</b> was not important. However, the provision of information (in itself) was more likely to activate existing attitudes already held by respondents than change these attitudes. • Labelling of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> products alone was unlikely to result in attitude activation. • These results are likely to be applicable only in cultures in which attitudes towards <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>foods</b> are already well established. Information may have a different impact in countries in which the public have not been exposed to information about <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>foods.</b> • Information source characteristics do influence consumer choices regarding <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>foods.</b> In particular, consumers are more likely to choose <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> products if the source providing information about them is perceived to be honest, and the information is product specific, or if the source is perceived to be dishonest, and the information is balanced and general in content. • Industry was perceived to be more dishonest providers of information about <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>foods</b> in Denmark, Italy and the United Kingdom, but not in Germany, where industry was as trusted as the other sources. • Increased transparency might improve public trust in industry. However, the public are more likely to believe the European Commission or consumer organisations when communicating about genetic modification.
