500|$|Rare {{decided to}} make an action-based game that focused totally on Banjo and his abilities. Kazooie was later {{conceived}} during the planning of such abilities.

We also wanted Banjo to be able to run very fast when required [...] we added a pair of 'fast-running' legs that appeared {{from the bottom of the}} backpack. [...] we came up with the logical conclusion that these could belong to another character, one that actually lived in Banjo's backpack." [...] The character was named after a kazoo, which was considered an annoying instrument, [...] "much like the personality of the bird", Mayles explained. Instead of actual dialogue, all the characters in the game feature [...] "mumbling" [...] voices. This choice was made to convey their personalities without them actually speaking, as Rare felt the actual speech [...] "could ruin the player's perception of the characters." [...] The witch Gruntilda was inspired by Grotbags from the Grotbags British television series.|$|E
