Gaga {{is one of the}} most talented artists I have worked with in my life and I'm excited about doing more with her... There are a lot of levels to the song. There's {{something}} very vulnerable about it and something very defiant about it, especially the way [...] sings it. The first verse is vulnerable—'You tell me it's going to get better?'—and the second verse comes in and it builds. Really? It gets better? No. You don't know until it <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>you...</b>|$|E
500|$|The album's {{characters}} {{include the}} [...] "Dogs", representing fervent capitalists, the [...] "Pigs", symbolising political corruption, and the [...] "Sheep", {{who represent the}} exploited. Croskery described the [...] "Sheep" [...] as being in a [...] "state of delusion created by a misleading cultural identity", a false consciousness. The [...] "Dog", in his tireless pursuit of self-interest and success, ends up depressed and alone {{with no one to}} trust, utterly lacking emotional satisfaction after a life of exploitation. Waters used Mary Whitehouse {{as an example of a}} [...] "Pig"; being someone who in his estimation, used the power of the government to impose her values on society. At the album's conclusion, Waters returns to empathy with the lyrical statement: [...] "You know that I care what <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> And I know that you care for me too." [...] However, he also acknowledges that the [...] "Pigs" [...] are a continuing threat and reveals that he is a [...] "Dog" [...] who requires shelter, suggesting the need for a balance between state, commerce and community, versus an ongoing battle between them.|$|E
500|$|Spence D. of IGN Music praised [...] "Ave Maria", {{writing that}} it shows Knowles in [...] "crystal clear form" [...] {{due to the}} mellow accompaniment that {{highlighted}} her [...] "often captivating" [...] voice. Darryl Sterdan, writing for the Canadian website Jam!, noted that Knowles [...] "draws on the classic composition for this sweeping number" [...] and echoes a similar line to John Lennon's quote: [...] "Life is what <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> while you're busy making other plans." [...] Talia Kraines of BBC Online called the song [...] "very strange, but wonderful". In his consumer guide, Robert Christgau wrote, [...] "But me, I'm a hater, and thus I'm something like outraged, by not just those two pimp-outs but an 'Ave Maria' lacking even the dumbstruck literalism of Pink's rendition or the grotesque conversion of 'Umbrella' into 'Halo.'" [...] Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald wrote that the song was [...] "pompous and frankly embarrassing". Colin McGuire of PopMatters commented that [...] "Ave Maria" [...] is a [...] "pretty normal take, a piece that has simply been done too many times before to think [...] would even {{have a shot at}} putting her stamp on it." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian described the song as [...] "dreary". According to James Reed of The Boston Globe, the song is [...] "an intriguing proposition torpedoed by a soggy arrangement". Adam Mazmanian of The Washington Times gave a negative review for the song, writing that the high notes included [...] on [...] "Ave Maria", [...] "should have remained a secret between Beyonce and her producers". In 2013, John Boone and Jennifer Cady of E! Online placed the song at number ten on their list of ten best Knowles' songs. They further added, [...] "The new classic kicks off with the plucking off some light strings and you know by the end you'll be singing through tears." ...|$|E

He was fifty years old. [...] "When that <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> as a child, you can face anything. You're always waiting for the other shoe to drop. If something great happens, you're like, 'Wow, that's great that happened, because it could have been crap'.

2500|$|On February 14, 2008, Bai Ling {{was arrested}} at Los Angeles International Airport for {{shoplifting}} two magazines and a package of batteries. It was an [...] "emotionally crazy" [...] day, Bai explained to E! News. She was coping with the [...] "huge problem of breaking up [...] Valentine's Day...wrong boyfriend." [...] She also wrote on her blog after the incident: [...] "Life <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> {{whether you like it}} or not, sometimes I feel you have to be so brave to stand in front of the world, and just hope that people will have a tender heart towards you." [...] On March 5, 2008 she pleaded guilty to the charge of disturbing the peace. [...] She was fined $200 (US$700 including the fine and penalties).|$|E
2500|$|This season {{also saw}} the {{introduction}} of red kryptonite. In the fourth episode of the second season, titled [...] "Red", Clark buys a high school ring that contains a red kryptonite gem. The effects of the kryptonite were meant {{to act as a}} metaphor for drugs. Loeb was given the task of writing [...] "Red" [...] by Gough and Millar, {{and one of the things}} he decided on was that the ultimate pay off with the kryptonite would be Clark finally kissing Lana. As Tom Welling describes it, [...] "With 'Red Clark' he's completely aware of the consequences of his actions at the time, but he doesn't care! He doesn't care what <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> and he certainly doesn't care what happens to himself, because he probably realizes that nothing can happen to him. It's always fun to be that way, even in real life, because we're not allowed to be that way all too often." [...] One of the concerns for the episode was whether the audience would embrace the idea of a [...] "bad Clark", as Ken Biller knew that Clark would have to be [...] "the villain of the story". Fortunately, audiences did embrace the idea and after the good ratings [...] "Red" [...] received, the WB requested more episodes with red kryptonite. Unfortunately, Gough and the crew did not like using it because of the idea of [...] "Clark [...] bad", but the team asked themselves, [...] "what if a friend slips something in your drink and you don’t know it?" [...] This became the basis in [...] "Rush", where Pete slips a shard of red kryptonite into Clark's pocket; it also gave the network what they wanted, but in the form of a single act instead of the entire episode. This element would show up again in the season finale, when Clark slips on another red kryptonite ring before riding out of Smallville on a motorcycle. According to Ken Biller, the moment Clark goes searching for the kryptonite is the payoff they had wanted with that piece of Superman mythology. The show had established that red kryptonite removes Clark's inhibitions, and in the season finale, Clark is to the point that he is willing to [...] "go 'on drugs' to solve his own pain and [...] guilt about what he's done".|$|E
