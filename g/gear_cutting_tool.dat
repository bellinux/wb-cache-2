40|$|The {{global market}} {{competition}} {{has put a}} pressure on the industry to reduce lead time and increase quality of parts. In particular, the area of <b>gear</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> design requires capability to rapidly produce tool designs with increased tool geometry precision. The aim {{of this research is}} to explore the field of gear shaper cutter design and produce a model and software that would enable creation of more precise cutter designs, faster. A literature survey of involute cylindrical gearing geometry highlights deficiencies in addressing industry requirements of tool manufacturing, as most of the research in the area is focused on problems of gear design, but not tool design. This research, therefore, focuses on the process of gear manufacturing using the gear shaper cutters. It attempts to develop an analytical model and a set of tools that are able to aid the design process of gear shaper cutter. With cylindrical gear being essentially " at" and therefore easier to express an- alytically, the focus of recent papers has shifted to non-cylindrical and non-involute gear trains. Yet the geometry of the tools used to produce cylindrical gears remains largely untapped area, in particular the geometry of gear shaper cutters. The knowl- edge about the profile of the cutter teeth and the profile cut by the cutter in the gear blank are essential for high precision gear manufacturing. The gear shaper cutter is a metal cutting tool and therefore should be re-sharpened on a regular basis. These re-sharpening operations change the profile of the tool and, consequently, the profile of the gear it cuts. The changes in the cutter and gear geometry are analysed in this thesis and a way to calculate the life span of the tool is suggested. Gear shaper cutter profiles usually have one or more modifications to the theoret- ical ideal involute profile applied. Some of these modifications are used to produce a better cutter profile, while other should in turn produce modifications to the gear profile, and, finally, some are used to overcome generated gear profile constraints. Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software for gear shaper cutter design should be able to show the profile of the cutter and the profile cut by the cutter with arbitrary modifications applied. The analysis and visualisation of gear shaper cutters profiles cut by these cutters is impossible without a clear understanding of the principles of operation of gear generation hardware, generating motion and different machine geometry, all being covered in this thesis. In order to verify the analytical model and the CAD software case studies of the real-life gear shaper cutter designs were performed...|$|E

The micro-structure, mechanical properties and tribological behaviors of traditional CrN and newly-fabricated CrAlN nanocomposite films were compared. XRD results showed that single-phase fcc (face-centered cubic) CrAlN films formed a solid solution whereby Cr atoms were substituted by Al atoms. High resolution TEM results demonstrate that the CrAlN film possesses a unique amorphous/crystalline nanocomposite micro-structure with ? 5 nm crystalline uniformly embedded into an amorphous matrix. In addition, CrAlN nanocomposite films exhibited relatively smaller grain size and denser structure when compared with CrN films.

40|$|The fillet of {{the gear}} tooth is highly {{stressed}} in operation; so for heavily loaded gears, the fillet geometry must be controlled. The manufacturer's task is to, within acceptable tolerances, produce the gear to the designer's specifications {{regardless of the}} manufacturing method. Most often <b>gear</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tools</b> are used that work under generating conditions. The tool will form the gear tooth; so to produce the specified gear geometry and, especially, the fillet geometry, this tool must be conjugated to the same basic rack as the gear to cut. However, this gives a risk that the tooth tip of the tool will be undercut, and if this occurs the tool will not cut the intended gear fillet. In this report, novel analytical equations are derived, which predict the limit when the tool tip will be undercut. It is shown that if the gear tooth should be conjugated to the standard basic rack with a circular fillet, which is the normal case, very large tool-tooth numbers are needed for pinion shaper cutters and gear skiving cutters to avoid this type of undercut. However, the minimum tooth number to achieve a smooth continuous tool-tooth profile is reduced by modifications to the fillet of the basic rack profile...|$|R
40|$|AbstractProduction {{processes}} for large module gears {{are characterized by}} small batch sizes and high workpiece costs. Therefore, the production of scrap parts cannot be accepted. Manufacturing processes are often not pushed to their limits so that the limits themselves are often not clearly known. To use the potentials of modern tool and machine tool concepts, a deeper theoretical understanding of the processes is necessary. This applies especially to modern indexable insert <b>gear</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tools,</b> which gain importance in these processes. In the past, <b>gear</b> <b>cutting</b> {{processes for}} large module gears have seldom been a subject of scientific research. Therefore, the design of these processes is largely based on experience. Especially, for the newer and more complex tool concepts using indexable inserts, a possibility to analyze processes theoretically is a key factor for {{deeper understanding of the}} processes and tool concepts. In this paper the two most important processes for green machining of large module gears, gear hobbing and form milling, are analyzed using simulation and machining trials. For the process simulation, major changes to existing process simulation tools for gear machining processes were implemented. For suitable machining trials, model processes were developed for milling and hobbing. These allow an analysis of the wear behavior of the tools based on a reduced number of machined parts. In this paper the bridge between simulation and machining for large module gears will be drawn in terms of chip removal and deformation, wear behavior and tool design features. As final result a first method for a simulation based process design will be given...|$|R
40|$|The {{vision of}} this thesis {{is to improve}} the metal cutting process, with {{emphasis}} on the <b>cutting</b> <b>tool,</b> to enable stable and economical industrial production while using expensive tools such as hobs. The aim is to increase the tribological understanding of the mechanisms operating at a cutting edge and of how these can be controlled using different tool parameters. Such understanding will facilitate {{the development and implementation of}} future, tribologically designed, <b>cutting</b> <b>tools.</b> Common wear and failure mechanisms in gear hobbing have been identified and focused studies of the material transferred to the tool, in both metal cutting operations and in simplified tribological tests, have been conducted. Interactions between residual stresses in the tool coating and the shape of the cutting edge have also been studied. It was concluded that tool failure is often initiated via small defects in the coated tool system, and it is necessary to eliminate, or minimize, these defects in order to manufacture more reliable and efficient <b>gear</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tools.</b> Furthermore, the geometry of a cutting edge should be optimized with the residual stress state in the coating, in mind. The interaction between a compressive stress and the geometry of the cutting edge will affect the stress state at the cutting edge and thus affect the practical toughness and the wear resistance of the coating in that area. An intermittent sliding contact test is presented and shown to be of high relevance for studying the interaction between the tool rake face and the chip in milling. It was also demonstrated that material transfer, that can have large effects on the cutting performance, commences already after very short contact times. The nature of the transfer may differ in different areas on the tool. It may include glassy layers, with accumulations of specific elements from the workpiece, and transfer of steel in more or less oxidized form. Both tool coating material, its surface roughness, and the relative speed between the tool surface and the chip, may influence the extent to which the different transfer will occur...|$|R
40|$|Friction, wear, and {{lubrication}} {{have direct}} influence on performance, reliability, and service life of mechanical systems with moving components. The useful life {{of these systems}} and their efficiency can be improved by improving the surface properties/ performance at sliding interfaces. Further, the usage of materials for sliding systems is limited in extreme environments, such as high temperature, and space, etc., due to their limited surface properties. This thesis focuses {{on the development of}} a new class of composites with superior surface properties, i. e., low friction and high wear resistance for extreme environmental conditions. Alumina, a well understood material for its tribological performance, is a merit choice for applications where high wear resistance is required, such as pump bearings, seal rings, valve seats, piston components, <b>gears,</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> inserts and artificial joints. We propose to develop a novel alumina based ceramic composite to enhance its surface and tribological properties using a powder compaction technique. The newly developed composites will be characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscope (FTIR), Optical microscope, Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (E-SEM), Goniometer and Surface profilometer. In-situ formation of high temperature stable phases, effect of sintering temperature, and percentage of reinforcement on phase formation will be studied. Investigation of effect of sintering temperature and percentage of reinforcement on density, porosity, and grain size will be conducted. The composites will be characterized for their tribological properties (friction and wear). The mechanisms for modified friction and wear will be proposed. The process parameters and compositions will be optimized. XRD results confirmed the formation of Al 18 B 4 O 33, and AlB 2 and FTIR confirmed the presence of B 2 O 3. Increase in sintering temperature and wt % of boron affected the porosity, grain size, and hardness of the composites. The coefficient of friction was lower for the composites compared to pure alumina ceramic. The coefficient of friction decreased with increase in sintering temperature.

Reliability calculation model is established, and experimental research on <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> is operated. The {{results show that the}} critical failure mode of <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> is electric die grinder. The crucial failure cause is that in the shearing process, the UO 2 ceramic in the fuel components is crushed into particles with high hardness, these hard material will lead to tool wear. The reliability of <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> is 0. 892, which can’t achieve the spent fuel reprocessing working shearing machine reliability requirements. The structure and materials of <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> must be improved. The parallel distance between the upper surface of <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> and the lower surface of the pressing block has to be adjusted...|$|R
