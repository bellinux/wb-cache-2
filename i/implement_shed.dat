40|$|The Istállóskő cave {{is one of}} the {{classical}} Palaeolithic sites in Hungary, generally regarded as the only important Aurignacian locality in Hungary with two discrete culture bearing layers. The lower unit, characterised by the presence of split based points {{played a key role in}} several theories on the appearance of the Upper Palaeolithic in Europe, while in the upper layer some Mladeč or Olschewa type points were found. In this paper the author reviews the antler and ivory artefacts found in the lower layer stored in the Hungarian National Museum. The reconstruction of assemblage formation was rather complicated, but the high number of fragments, the occurrence of typical macrofracture patterns and the rejuvenated <b>implements</b> <b>shed</b> light to the human behaviour. Finally a few pieces with sufficient preservation allow us to point some details to the operational chain of the osseous tool production. All these aspects of the assemblage were determined by the topographic location of the cave, lying at a large relative height by the end of a long and deep valley, determining the nature of the human occupation of this locality. This raises the question of the comparability of the assemblages with other collections...|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at www. springerlink. comThis paper investigates the impact ash fall would have on dairy farming, based on a study of ‘Tulachard’, a dairy farming operation at Rerewhakaaitu, North Island, New Zealand. It includes analysis of the potential effects on the dairy shed and milking machine, electrical supply and distribution, water supply and distribution, tractors and other farm vehicles, farm buildings (haysheds, pump <b>sheds,</b> <b>implement</b> <b>sheds,</b> etc.), milk-tanker access to the farm and critical needs of dairy cows and farm to keep milking. One of the most vulnerable areas identified {{in the study was}} the cooling of milk at the milking shed, pending dairy tanker pick-up. The cooling system’s condenser is exposed to the atmosphere and falling ash would make it highly vulnerable. Laboratory testing with wet and dry ash was conducted to determine its resilience to ash ingestion. It was found to perform satisfactorily during dry testing, but during wet testing significant clogging/blocking of the condenser’s radiator occurred, dramatically reducing airflow through the condenser. Specific mitigation recommendations have been developed that include cleaning with compressed air and adapting farm management techniques to lessen usage of the condenser during an ash-fall event. Specific recommendations for management of dairy farm operation are given to mitigate the effects of an ash-fall event...|$|R

Seated, with her needlework or netting apparatus, at the window, she had a self- laudatory sense of correcting, by her ladylike deportment, the rude business aspect of the place. With this impression of her interesting character upon her, Mrs. Sparsit considered herself, in some sort, the Bank Fairy. The townspeople who, in their passing and repassing, saw her there, regarded her as the Bank Dragon keeping watch over the treasures of the mine.|$|R

30|$|For <b>implementing</b> load <b>shedding</b> in the network, low {{priority}} consumers in out-of-service un-faulted area are identified.

The study offers insights into the features that make an MSS optimisation model and scheduler effective and easy to <b>implement,</b> and <b>shed</b> light on those actions facilitating their introduction and use. Specifically, it suggests that creating an effective operating room scheduler requires clustering patients in homogeneous surgery groups and developing a flexible tool that allows: scheduling surgery groups instead of actual patients, easily adding/removing constraints, changing the objective function(s) and adjusting the planning horizon. In addition, it posits that gaining the commitment of top management by showing credible preliminary results, inferring stakeholder preferences by letting them comment on tentative schedules, introducing changes gradually and involving staff at lower levels of the hospital hierarchy can significantly facilitate the scheduler development and implementation...|$|R

40|$|The TOPEX mission {{requirements}} which {{impact the}} power requirements and analyses are presented. A {{description of the}} electrical power system (EPS), including energy management and battery charging methods that were conceived and developed to meet the identified satellite requirements, is included. Analysis of the TOPEX EPS confirms that all of its electrical performance and reliability requirements have been met. The TOPEX EPS employs the flight-proven modular power system (MPS) {{which is part of}} the Multimission Modular Spacecraft and provides high reliability, abbreviated development effort and schedule, and low cost. An energy balance equation, unique to TOPEX, has been derived to confirm that the batteries will be completely recharged following each eclipse, under worst-case conditions. TOPEX uses three NASA Standard 50 AH Ni-Cd batteries, each with 22 cells in series. The MPS contains battery charge control and protection based on measurements of battery currents, voltages, temperatures, and computed depth-of-discharge.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the technical design concept for a low-cost building communications network {{that will allow}} most building equipment loads, including individual light fixtures, operable window blinds, motors and environmental sensors, to be controlled and monitored from an existing Ethernet. IBECS (Integrated Building Environmental Communications System) is a practical networking system that will provide building managers with an unprecedented degree of control over most building electrical loads, allowing them to <b>implement</b> load <b>shedding,</b> real time pricing and aggregated building load strategies with confidence. At the same time, IBECS will let individual occupants exert appropriate control over their environmental conditions (light and, ultimately, heat), initially using a virtual control panel served from their web browser, and eventually through voice command.

30|$|A {{fast service}} {{restoration}} in distribution networks is <b>implemented,</b> considering load <b>shedding</b> as a multiple objective function problem. This paper presents two new heuristic methods {{based on two}} important indices and a graph-based method. The core of the first proposed algorithm is the voltage drop between candidate TS and the substation bus, and {{the core of the}} second algorithm is based on a graph-based method to minimize the voltage drop in the network. Finally, the proposed methods are tested in 69 -bus and 119 -bus distribution networks on two scenarios (with load shedding and without load shedding). The results show that these methods can be used for solving the service restoration problems in modern distribution networks.|$|R

40|$|In South Africa, ESCOM is the country’s main {{electricity}} supplier. Since 2008, Eskom has <b>implemented</b> load <b>shedding</b> on {{an ongoing}} basis as a result of insufficient electricity supply {{to meet the demands of}} all its customers. Owing to the fact that many organisations across South Africa are depended on electricity in order to function, previous research studies show that the wide-spread impact of load shedding has had an adverse on the sustainability of many of these organisations. Among these organisations are those based in the hospitality industry – imperative in relation to the stimulation of the national economy; directly related to tourism. Albeit the aforementioned, the sustainability of organisations in the hospitality industry is also heavily dependent on the productivity of their employees. For this research study the influence of load shedding on the productivity of the staff in the hospitality industry was investigated within one particular hotel (Hotel X) based in Cape Town. Empirical research was deployed, making use of a mixed methods approach to obtain both quantitative data and qualitative data from respondents. Stemming from the findings it was found that load shedding did have an adverse influence on the productivity of staff in Hotel X, despite the fact that affordable measures were put in place to mitigate the disruptions caused by load shedding. Moreover, the latter dispensation was found to have an inadvertently adverse influence on the overall sustainability of Hotel X on the long run...|$|R
