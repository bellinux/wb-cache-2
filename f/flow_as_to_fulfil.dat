MOFs represent an exciting new class of nanoporous crystalline solids constituting metal ions/clusters and multifunctional organic linkages, which self-assemble at molecular level to generate a plethora of ordered 3 D framework materials. The most intriguing feature of a MOF lies in its exceptionally large surface area, far surpassing those of the best activated carbons and zeolites. Next generation multifunctional materials encompassing MOF based thin films, coatings, membranes and nanocomposites have potential for exploitation in an immense array of unconventional applications and smart devices.

We discuss two approaches, viz., (1) the disassembly graph approach that is based on the study of the disassembly of mechanical products and (2) the component-disassembly optimization model that focuses on parts recovery by applying the reverse bill of materials. Although elegant, the main disadvantages of these two approaches are redundancy and nonlinearity respectively. To overcome these disadvantages, we propose a new method that combines the advantages of both approaches without their disadvantages. This is called the tree network model, which is a linear description of the demand driven, multiple product problem that includes commonality and multiplicity. Because of its simple structure, it can also be applied in dynamic situations, which is useful in problems that are related to production planning and inventory control in reverse logistics...|$|R

Referring to a Time-Code Division Multiple Access air interface, we propose a Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol based on a random access scheme. A successful attempt grants the use of a slot-code resource. This protocol is named Adaptive Time Code-Packet Reservation Multiple Access (ATC-PRMA), since the access parameters are changed, depending on the traffic load conditions, so <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>fulfil</b> Quality of Service requirements. Numerical examples are carried out for the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) -Mobile Satellite System (MSS) scenario, but all these considerations could be applied to High-Altitude Platform Stations (HAPSs) as well. In both cases, high propagation delays prevent an immediate feedback to users. An analytical approach is proposed to study the stability of our MAC scheme. Accordingly, we define a criterion for optimizing system performance. The predicted ATC-PRMA behaviour is supported by simulation results. Finally, we show the performance improvement of ATC-PRMA with respect to a MAC protocol not employing adaptive parameters...|$|R

First, the original MVG, the improved MVG and the proposed MVG are discussed. Then, a comprehensive analysis of the proposed MVG is conducted. Consequently, the proposed MVG is extended to electronic-continuously variable transmission for hybrid vehicular propulsion. By using finite element analysis, the electromagnetic performances of three MVGs at various gear ratios are evaluated, hence validating the theoretical design. Moreover, the process of gear-ratio-changing is simulated and analysed. A quantitative comparison among these MVGs is also carried out. Hence, the corresponding validity can be further verified. postprin...|$|R
