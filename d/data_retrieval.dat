40|$|The Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment III (SAGE III) on the International Space Station (ISS) {{will extend}} NASA Langley Research Center's long legacy of {{satellite}} atmospheric occultation measurements. Unlike its predecessors, SAGE III ISS will encounter off-nadir attitudes and jitter conditions {{caused by the}} mechanical instability of the ISS environment. The retrieval algorithm for the SAGE III science data product requires precise and accurate knowledge of the instrument boresight pointing with respect to Earth and the radiant target, either Sun or Moon. Without knowledge of the attitude drifts at the instrument scan head and the associated mechanical jitter the <b>data</b> <b>retrievals</b> will be compromised. A subsystem on the payload termed the Disturbance Monitoring Package (DMP), which is comprised of a Miniature Inertial Measurement Unit (MIMU) built by Honeywell Aerospace of Clearwater, Florida, was added to quantify this disturbance. By calibrating coordinate transformations on orbit and using attitude determination algorithms, the pointing information needed for post-processing can be derived. This research will provide the necessary calibration methods and simulate the on-orbit mechanical environment {{to prepare for the}} SAGE III ISS mission ensuring that the <b>data</b> <b>retrievals</b> maintain the high standard expected of this class of instrument.

The Satellaview base unit contained around 512 KB of memory of its own; however, the deluxe Memory Pak was required for larger games and to allow the player to have multiple saved games.

25|$|Btrieve {{is not a}} {{relational}} database management system (RDBMS). Early descriptions of Btrieve {{referred to it as}} a record manager (though Pervasive initially used the term navigational database but later changed this to transactional database) because it only deals with the underlying record creation, <b>data</b> <b>retrieval,</b> record updating and data deletion primitives. It uses ISAM as its underlying indexing and storage mechanism. A key part of Pervasive's architecture is the use of a MicroKernel Database Engine, which allows different database backends to be modularised and integrated easily into their DBMS package, Pervasive.SQL. This has enabled them to support both their Btrieve navigational database engine and an SQL-based engine, Scalable SQL.|$|E
25|$|Rosetta was {{launched}} on 2 March 2004 from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana on an Ariane 5 rocket and reached Comet Churyumov–Gerasimenko on 7 May 2014. It performed {{a series of}} maneuvers to enter orbit between then and 6 August 2014, when it became the first spacecraft to orbit a comet. (Previous missions had conducted successful flybys of seven other comets.) It was one of ESA's Horizon 2000 cornerstone missions. The spacecraft consisted of the Rosetta orbiter, which featured 12 instruments, and the Philae lander, with nine additional instruments. The Rosetta mission orbited Comet Churyumov–Gerasimenko for 17 months and was designed to complete the most detailed study of a comet ever attempted. The spacecraft was controlled from the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC), in Darmstadt, Germany. The planning for {{the operation of the}} scientific payload, together with the <b>data</b> <b>retrieval,</b> calibration, archiving and distribution, was performed from the European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC), in Villanueva de la Cañada, near Madrid, Spain. It has been estimated that in the decade preceding 2014, some 2,000 people assisted in the mission in some capacity.|$|E

500|$|The Chrono Cross team devised an {{original}} battle system using a stamina bar and Elements. Kato planned the system around allowing players to avoid repetitive gameplay (also known as [...] "grinding") to gain combat experience. Hiromichi Tanaka likened the Elements system to card games, hoping players would {{feel a sense}} of complete control in battle. The team programmed each battle motion manually instead of performing motion capture. Developers strove to include tongue-in-cheek humor in the battle system's techniques and animations to distance the game from the Final Fantasy franchise. Masato Kato planned for the game's setting to feature a small archipelago, for fear that players would become confused traveling in large areas with respect to parallel worlds. He hoped El Nido would still impart a sense of grand scale, and the development team pushed hardware limitations in creating the game's world. To create field maps, the team modeled locations in 3D, then chose the best angle for 2D rendering. The programmers of Chrono Cross did not use any existing Square programs or routines to code the game, instead writing new, proprietary systems. Other innovations included variable-frame rate code for fast-forward and slow-motion gameplay (awarded as a bonus for completing the game) and a [...] "CD-read swap" [...] system to allow quick <b>data</b> <b>retrieval.</b>|$|E

2500|$|OBD-II {{provides}} {{access to}} data from the engine control unit (ECU) and offers a valuable source of information when troubleshooting problems inside a vehicle. The SAE J1979 standard defines a method for requesting various diagnostic data {{and a list of}} standard parameters that might be available from the ECU. The various parameters that are available are addressed by [...] "parameter identification numbers" [...] (parameter IDs or PIDs) which are defined in J1979. For a list of basic PIDs, their definitions, and the formula to convert raw OBD-II output to meaningful diagnostic units, see OBD-II PIDs. Manufacturers are not required to implement all PIDs listed in J1979 and they are allowed to include proprietary PIDs that are not listed. The PID request and <b>data</b> <b>retrieval</b> system gives access to real time performance data as well as flagged DTCs.

[...] This publication was modified slightly in December 1970 and January 1979, and the 1979 edition (reissued in 1982 and 1985) is the most current version. In 1995, the Subcommittee drafted some modifications to the API numbering scheme, but the group was disbanded before the recommendations were published. [...] The 1979 standards are still in effect, but the publication is no longer available from API [...] In 2013, the PPDM Association issued an updated standard for the API Number (now called the US Well Number) which includes a requirement to identify all wellbores within each well. The 1979 standard and the 2013 standard, along with supporting materials, are available at PPDM Association's website for well identification.|$|E
2500|$|The first working laser was {{demonstrated}} on 16 May 1960 by Theodore Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories. When first invented, {{they were called}} [...] "a solution looking for a problem". Since then, lasers have become a multibillion-dollar industry, finding utility in thousands of highly varied applications. The first application of lasers visible in {{the daily lives of}} the general population was the supermarket barcode scanner, introduced in 1974. The laserdisc player, introduced in 1978, was the first successful consumer product to include a laser, but the compact disc player was the first laser-equipped device to become truly common in consumers' homes, beginning in 1982. These optical storage devices use a semiconductor laser less than a millimetre wide to scan the surface of the disc for <b>data</b> <b>retrieval.</b> Fibre-optic communication relies on lasers to transmit large amounts of information at the speed of light. Other common applications of lasers include laser printers and laser pointers. Lasers are used in medicine in areas such as bloodless surgery, laser eye surgery, and laser capture microdissection and in military applications such as missile defence systems, electro-optical countermeasures (EOCM), and lidar. Lasers are also used in holograms, bubblegrams, laser light shows, and laser hair removal.|$|E
