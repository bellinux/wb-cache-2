40|$|Changes in <b>deep</b> <b>ocean</b> {{carbonate}} chemistry {{have profound}} implications for glacial-interglacial atmospheric CO₂ changes. Here, we review <b>deep</b> <b>ocean</b> carbonate ion concentration ([CO₃²⁻]) changes {{based on the}} benthic foraminiferal boron-to-calcium ratio (B/Ca) and their links to global carbon reorganization since the last ice age. Existing <b>deep</b> <b>ocean</b> [CO₃²⁻] reconstructions are consistent with changes in the biological pump, in ocean stratification, and in the associated oceanic alkalinity inventory as key mechanisms for modulating atmospheric CO₂ on glacial-interglacial time scales. We find that the global mean <b>deep</b> <b>ocean</b> [CO₃²⁻] was roughly similar between the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 18, 000 – 22, 000 years ago) and the Late Holocene (0 – 5, 000 years ago). In view of elevated glacial surface [CO₃²⁻], this indicates enhanced storage of respiratory carbon in a more alkaline <b>deep</b> <b>ocean</b> during the LGM. During early deglaciation, rising [CO₃²⁻] at three locations in the <b>deep</b> <b>ocean</b> suggests a release of deep-sea CO₂ to the atmosphere, probably via the Southern Ocean. Both increased late deglacial carbonate burial in deep-sea sediments due to elevated [CO₃²⁻] and Holocene expansion of coral reefs on newly flooded continental shelves depleted global ocean alkalinity, which reduced CO₂ solubility in seawater and contributed to atmospheric CO₂ rises at these times...|$|R

The conventional biological pump concept and the recently proposed microbial carbon pump mechanism provide a foundation for our understanding of the role of microorganisms in cycling of carbon in the ocean. However, there are significant gaps in our knowledge and a lack of mechanistic understanding of the processes of microbially-mediated production, transformation, degradation, and export of marine dissolved and particulate organic matter (DOM and POM) in the <b>deep</b> <b>ocean</b> and the ecological consequence. Here we propose the POM-DOM piezophilic microorganism continuum (PDPMC) conceptual model, to address these important biogeochemical processes in the <b>deep</b> <b>ocean.</b> We propose that piezophilic microorganisms (bacteria and archaea) play a pivotal role in <b>deep</b> <b>ocean</b> carbon cycle where microbial production of exoenzymes, enzymatic breakdown of DOM and transformation of POM fuels the rapid cycling of marine organic matter, and serve as the primary driver for carbon cycle in the <b>deep</b> <b>ocean...</b>|$|R

40|$|Heat {{transport}} {{between the}} surface and <b>deep</b> <b>ocean</b> strongly influences transient climate change. Mechanisms setting this transport are investigated using coupled climate models and by projecting ocean circulation into the temperature-depth diagram. In this diagram, a “cold cell” cools the <b>deep</b> <b>ocean</b> through the downwelling of Antarctic waters and upwelling of warmer waters and is balanced by warming due to a “warm cell,” coincident with the interhemispheric overturning and previously linked to wind and haline forcing. With anthropogenic warming, the cold cell collapses while the warm cell continues to warm the <b>deep</b> <b>ocean.</b> Simulations with increasingly strong warm cells, set by their mean Southern Hemisphere winds, exhibit increasing deep-ocean warming {{in response to the}} same anthropogenic forcing. It is argued that the partition between components of the circulation which cool and warm the <b>deep</b> <b>ocean</b> in the preindustrial climate is a key determinant of ocean vertical heat transport with global warming...|$|R
40|$|There is a long-established, {{remarkable}} {{correspondence between}} the nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratio N:P~ 15 of <b>deep</b> <b>ocean</b> water and the ''Redfield ratio'' of N:P~ 16 required by phytoplankton.

Models have shown this mechanism can work, but recent observations reveal that the real system is more complex. First, the C:N:P stoichiometry of phytoplankton varies with growth rate, nutrient and light limitation, species and phylum.

Here we adapt recent models to include non-Redfieldian stoichiometry of phytoplankton and limitation of N-fixers by resources other than P. We show that the <b>deep</b> <b>ocean</b> N:P is set by the N:P threshold that triggers N-fixation, and is not directly related to the N:P ratio of sinking material. However, assuming competitive dynamics set the N:P threshold for N-fixation, it will be close to the N:P requirement of non-fixers (rather than that of N-fixers) and consequently so will the <b>deep</b> <b>ocean</b> N:P ratio. Theoretical limits on the N:P requirements of phytoplankton suggest that since the <b>deep</b> <b>ocean</b> became well oxygenated, its N:P has remained within the range 7. 7 &ndash; 32. 3.

40|$|The recalcitrance of {{dissolved}} {{organic carbon}} (DOC) that leads to its accumulation in the <b>deep</b> <b>ocean</b> is typically considered a function of its reactivity. Yet, recent experimental evidence has shown that DOC from the <b>deep</b> <b>ocean,</b> if concentrated, can support significant microbial growth. This supports an alternative hypothesis that [DOC] may become too dilute to support microbial growth. The radiocarbon signature of DOC is a key constraint on the DOC cycling that allows testing of the plausibility of this hypothesis. Here we use a box model of diluted DOC in the <b>deep</b> <b>ocean</b> and its radiocarbon signature that is constrained {{on the basis of}} the new experimental evidence, as well as current knowledge of <b>deep</b> <b>ocean</b> DOC cycling to quantitatively test the dilution hypothesis. We explore the uncertainty in model results across a range of plausible dilution thresholds, additional processes, and fluxes of DOC to the <b>deep</b> <b>ocean.</b> Results show that the model is able to predict the observed radiocarbon signature for a dilution threshold close to the observed <b>deep</b> <b>ocean</b> [DOC] and for fluxes close to published estimates. Sensitivity analysis shows that this result is highly sensitive to variations in the dilution threshold and the assumption that diluted DOC is able to survive ocean overturning. The experimental findings can be alternatively reconciled over a large range of different conditions assuming a small pool of diluted DOC with a modern radiocarbon signature, consistent with recent observations, and offering a parsimonious interpretation of dilution with existing hypotheses on DOC recalcitrance.
