5000|$|At {{some point}} after the Second World War the wagon works were {{taken over by}} the scrap {{merchant}} Thos W Ward and used for breaking up redundant railway rolling stock, including locomotives, with railway literature referring to the site as both wagon works and Ward's. The location is close to the [...] "V" [...] of the junction, as {{can be seen from the}} attached image, where the photographer was on a <b>diverted</b> <b>train</b> travelling from the Old Road to the Beighton Branch, with the Old Road clearly visible to the right of the yard, and Brookhouse Colliery and coke ovens in the distance, north east of camera. Like its fellow site at Killamarsh, it became a focus of interest for railway enthusiasts, but was much less accessible without trespass, with the result that fewer photographs survive.|$|E
50|$|On 17 March 1990 Bradford North Curve was removed; it {{had been}} {{retained}} in latter years to handle <b>diverted</b> <b>trains</b> during engineering closure of the Box line, but the elimination of locomotive-hauled passenger <b>trains</b> meant that <b>diverted</b> <b>trains</b> could simply reverse at Bradford south junction.|$|R
5000|$|The station re-opened {{very briefly}} in 1972 for <b>diverted</b> <b>trains</b> while Sheffield (Midland) station {{was closed for}} re-signalling.|$|R
50|$|The {{branch is}} {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} turn-around for <b>diverted</b> <b>trains</b> {{in the event of}} disruption on the Eastbourne line, or for 'Ghost Trains' switching back to Newhaven Harbour.|$|R
5000|$|The {{services}} to London are operated by British Rail Class 313s and <b>diverted</b> <b>trains</b> {{when there are}} engineering works on the East Coast Main Line also run along this line.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} opened by the LSWR in 1847. Passenger {{services}} were withdrawn in May 1969, although occasional <b>diverted</b> <b>trains</b> and railtours {{continued to use}} the line, passing through the station without calling.|$|R
50|$|The New North Main Line {{offers an}} {{alternative}} route to central London for the Chiltern Main Line {{and can be}} used to <b>divert</b> <b>trains</b> away from Marylebone when the station is closed for engineering works.|$|R
50|$|The first closure came in 1917, {{although}} services {{had been}} suspended {{for the most}} part since 1915, to save money and resources for the war effort. It was still possible for <b>diverted</b> <b>trains</b> and excursions or other special services to use the line.|$|R
50|$|In 1865 and 1866 {{respectively}} the SCR and the SNER were further {{absorbed by the}} Caledonian Railway, forming a continuous line under single ownership from Carlisle to Aberdeen. The Caledonian control ended the reason for <b>diverting</b> <b>trains</b> away from the Forfar route, and the Friockheim curve was closed again, on 1 November 1867.|$|R
2500|$|Piccadilly {{remained}} open {{throughout the}} reconstruction but much disruption was caused to train services and extensive use {{was made of}} Manchester Mayfield and [...] stations by <b>diverted</b> <b>trains.</b> When the work was completed, both stations were closed as surplus to requirements when services into Manchester from the south were concentrated at Piccadilly.|$|R
25|$|From December 2018, {{as part of}} the Thameslink Programme, {{services}} from the East Coast Main Line/Great Northern Route, also part of the Govia Thameslink Railway franchise, will be linked to the Thameslink route, <b>diverting</b> <b>trains</b> previously terminating at Kings Cross into the Thameslink platforms at St Pancras and then through central London to Sussex and Kent.|$|R
50|$|Ethelton station {{opened in}} 1916, {{following}} {{construction of the}} Commercial Road viaduct at Port Adelaide and a new bridge across the Port River. This new line <b>diverted</b> <b>trains</b> from Adelaide to Semaphore and Outer Harbor away from the congested rail yards at Port Dock station and to avoid heavy traffic along St Vincents Street in the centre of Port Adelaide.|$|R

5000|$|In 1930, 211,000 {{passengers}} were counted departing from Falkenberg. At that time, eight express, six semi-fast and 42 stopping trains ran daily in different directions. [...] Since the late 1960s, scheduled traffic from Berlin towards Dresden and Riesa has almost exclusively been {{carried on the}} Berlin-Dresden railway. But even after 2000, <b>diverted</b> <b>trains</b> often ran between Berlin and Dresden via Falkenberg, but without stopping at the station.|$|R
50|$|These {{last three}} {{are used by}} service trains or in order to <b>divert</b> {{passenger}} <b>trains</b> if needed.|$|R
50|$|In August 2008, {{work was}} {{completed}} on two new bridges across the Port River at Port Adelaide, downstream {{of the inner}} harbour. One of these, the Mary Mackillop Bridge, <b>diverted</b> <b>trains</b> away from the Rosewater Loop and allows them to completely bypass the suburban rail network in Port Adelaide. The other bridge is for road traffic on the Port River Expressway, which has been built parallel and closer to Port Adelaide.|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} three platforms. Platforms 1 and 2 {{are the two}} faces of an island platform, {{accessed}} via a footbridge from outside the main ticket office. Platform 1 is the London-bound platform and platform 2 is a reversing platform {{which can be used}} to <b>divert</b> <b>trains</b> from one line to the other. Platform 3 is the -bound platform, reached from Station Approach via the main ticket office.|$|R
5000|$|The ride {{begins with}} the train making a 180-degree turn out of the station, {{traveling}} near Vortex's first drop and through a switch track, which provides the option of <b>diverting</b> <b>trains</b> to a covered storage area. Riders take a slight left turn into the first lift hill and slowly climbs 110 ft. At the crest, the train travels down a 135 ft into an underground tunnel, passing an on-ride camera.|$|R
5000|$|Adorf (Vogtl) {{station is}} the station of Adorf in the German state of Saxony. It is a railway {{junction}} with only local significance. Only the Plauen-Cheb railway is still operated by scheduled trains, the railway towards Chemnitz {{has not yet}} been closed, but only serves <b>diverted</b> <b>trains.</b> It no longer has scheduled passenger services. The railway towards Aš and the Siebenbrunn-Erlbach railway, trains on which used to pass through to Adorf, are now both closed.|$|R
5000|$|While the {{electrification}} of the West Coast Main Line {{was underway}} the former GWR line did {{see a large}} increase in its traffic and a reopening of the station appear likely, but once the West Coast Main Line had been re-reopened the <b>diverted</b> <b>trains</b> were removed and the additional services quickly reduced. The last Paddington to Birkenhead express train ran {{on the line in}} March 1967, and after 1970 it was normally only used by goods trains.|$|R
500|$|Auchinleck to Newmilns: {{the section}} between Auchinleck and Cronberry closed to {{passenger}} traffic on 3 July 1950. The line between Cronberry and Newmilns {{was part of}} a route between Ayr and Muirkirk, but this too closed to passenger trains on 1 October 1950. [...] In 1951 services were reinstated for two weeks to accommodate <b>diverted</b> <b>trains</b> from Edinburgh to Ayr. The entire line from Auchinleck to Muirkirk then closed to regular passenger traffic on 1 October 1950; the line was used until 1976.|$|R
50|$|Overall, {{the track}} had a {{complicated}} route with many bridges and tunnels, {{in order to}} provide a maximum grade of 1:50 so that heavy military trains could run on the line. At the beginning of the 20th century, a second track was built for the same reason. But contrary to all planning, military trains used the rather poor grades of the Leinefelde-Kassel line. Thus, the planned strategic line was never used for this purpose, except for some <b>diverted</b> <b>trains</b> in World War II.|$|R
5000|$|Auchinleck to Newmilns: {{the section}} between Auchinleck and Cronberry closed to {{passenger}} traffic on 3 July 1950. The line between Cronberry and Newmilns {{was part of}} a route between Ayr and Muirkirk, but this too closed to passenger trains on 1 October 1950. In 1951 services were reinstated for two weeks to accommodate <b>diverted</b> <b>trains</b> from Edinburgh to Ayr. The entire line from Auchinleck to Muirkirk then closed to regular passenger traffic on 1 October 1950; the line was used until 1976.|$|R
50|$|In 1965 a {{connecting}} spur {{was installed}} between the former Nunnery Colliery Branch and the ex-MS&LR Main Line {{a quarter of}} a mile east of Sheffield Victoria. This allowed trains from Sheffield Midland to run north eastwards onto ex-MS&LR metals and vice versa. From 4 October of that year most services which had run to and from the east into Sheffield Victoria were diverted to Sheffield Midland. This had no direct, daily effect on Beighton Junction, but it did open up the possibility of <b>diverted</b> <b>trains</b> using Beighton as a diversionary route. <b>Diverted</b> southbound <b>trains</b> could travel northeast from Sheffield Midland onto the ex-MS&LR line, east to Woodhouse Junction, southeast to the Beighton Junction 1849 then southwards down the Old Road to regain their conventional route at Tapton Junction north of Chesterfield. Northbound trains could reverse the process.|$|R
5000|$|The {{line through}} the station, which runs from Lichfield on the {{high-level}} line and {{is connected to the}} Southbound WCML by a single track chord, runs via the station site to Wychnor Junction, near Burton upon Trent. Primarily a freight route, the line is also used by Virgin Trains to move trains from Birmingham to Bombardier's maintenance depot at Central Rivers, near Burton. The route is sometimes used as a means of <b>diverting</b> <b>trains</b> when engineering takes place between Birmingham New Street and Tamworth.|$|R
50|$|From December 2018, {{as part of}} the Thameslink Programme, {{services}} from the East Coast Main Line/Great Northern Route, also part of the Govia Thameslink Railway franchise, will be linked to the Thameslink route, <b>diverting</b> <b>trains</b> previously terminating at Kings Cross into the Thameslink platforms at St Pancras and then through central London to Sussex and Kent.This link was made possible by the construction of two tunnels named the canal tunnels. These are about 100 metres north of the Thameslink platforms, and they will join the ECML where the North London Line and HS1 go over the top.|$|R

50|$|Until the {{re-opening}} of Birmingham Snow Hill for {{stations to}} Kidderminster in 1995, all passenger services routed via Smethwick and Galton Junctions to reach Birmingham New Street. With this re-opening, {{use of the}} link between the two junctions has sharply decreased. This was compounded with the removal/re-routing of the Worcester to New Street service in 2004, and now only selected freight services and charter trains use the link. It has also been used as a way to <b>divert</b> <b>trains</b> to Cheltenham Spa via Stourbridge Junction and Worcester Shrub Hill. In addition, the first and last Cardiff Central CrossCountry services of the day, which start and terminate at New Street, use this junction for operational reasons.|$|R
50|$|The New Delhi-Chennai Grand {{trunk route}} and Howrah-Nagpur-Mumbai line both have heavy {{passenger}} {{as well as}} goods train traffic. In {{the case of the}} Narkhed-Amravati line, there is the option of <b>diverting</b> the <b>train</b> on this route to continue the rail traffic.|$|R
50|$|The station {{opened on}} 1 February 1878, and closed {{permanently}} to passengers on 7 March 1955, although {{the line was}} still in use by freight <b>trains</b> and <b>diverted</b> passenger <b>trains</b> until 23 October 1973. Freight services had been withdrawn from the station in October 1955.|$|R
50|$|The new Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine {{rail link}} <b>diverted</b> coal <b>trains</b> {{away from the}} bridge. Instead they travel via Stirling to Longannet Power Station. Freight {{restrictions}} may then be lifted, with the potential of {{increasing the number of}} trains from 10 tph (trains per hour) to 12.|$|R
5000|$|The {{station was}} closed by British Railways on 31 March 1952, when {{passenger}} trains over the route between [...] and [...] were withdrawn. The line {{is still in}} use for freight and occasional <b>diverted</b> passenger <b>trains,</b> but {{no trace of the}} station itself remains.|$|R
50|$|Regionalbahn service R 11 {{currently}} operates {{only four}} services {{on the line}} on working days using class 426 electric multiple units, {{two in the morning}} and two in the afternoon. In addition there is an overnight City Night Line 419 service, which sometimes runs all the way from Amsterdam to Munich (for example, in September and October 2009) without stopping in Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof, but only stopping in Ludwigsburg and Plochingen. On these nights, it runs around 4:00 AM on the Stuttgart-Untertürkheim-Kornwestheim line. It was also served from 1992 to 2006 by one pair of ICE Sprinter service bypassing Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof. In addition, it is also used by some <b>diverted</b> <b>trains</b> (e.g. when access to Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof is blocked) and some short S-Bahn line services.|$|R
