40|$|Little {{scholarship}} exists {{about the}} extent of musical nationalism in the works of twentieth-century Italian composer Alfredo Casella (1883 - 1947). Casella’s output, which is divided into three <b>stylistic</b> <b>periods</b> – 1902 - 1913, 1914 - 1920, and 1921 - 1946 – display varying styles and influences, such as an extension of French, German, and Russian romanticism and Schoenbergian atonality. Yet nationalistic expression simultaneously pervades each stylistic period: The first period portrays nationalism through the use of folk material and forms, as does the second, which also uses programmatic elements in an atonal context. The third <b>stylistic</b> <b>period,</b> to which previous scholars have given the most attention, expresses nationalism by alluding to past Italian Baroque and Classical composers and forms. This thesis explores how Casella’s nationalistic tendencies pervade all three <b>stylistic</b> <b>periods</b> and evolved {{over the course of his}} career, culminating in his third <b>stylistic</b> <b>period.</b> A close reading of Casella’s own writings – which will explore how his ideologies reflected the political and cultural views in Italy at the time – and score analysis of representative works from each period will reveal in Casella’s works “a music unquestionably Italian in idiom 2 ̆ 2 (Alfredo Casella, 21 + 26, 41) ...|$|R

5000|$|Traditional {{music of}} Horňácko is formed by several <b>distinctive</b> <b>stylistic</b> elements. The {{ornamentation}} of the melody varies by instrument and musician.

The other musicians accompany the primáš with their own ornamentations, following only {{the basic structure of}} a song. Folk musicians from Horňácko often use unusual combinations of tones and harsh harmonies, seemingly omitting the standard procedures of musical theory. The structure is, however, firmly anchored by rhythmic and harmonic plan.|$|R

40|$|In {{the article}} the author underlines the {{importance}} of details (moulds and profiles) for the architects of previous times. The architects of the 17 th- 19 th centuries expressed their creative and filosofic position choosing some concrete example of the great theorists of the past when constructing moulds and orders. We should note that the negative attitude to Classicism theory reasoned in the lack of investigations of the architectural details of the buildings of the 18 th- 19 th centuries, in particular the ones in Saint Petersburg. At the present moment the interest to studying the architectural theories and forms is reappearing both in Russia and in Europe. The article considers the architectural moulds {{of the eighteenth century}} buildings of St. Petersburg, examples of their construction in each <b>stylistic</b> <b>period.</b> The analysis shows the significant differences of the Russian moulds drawings from the recommendations of classical treatises of the Renaissance and educational counterparts. The author offers the basic analysis of the characteristic features and data elements for each <b>stylistic</b> <b>period</b> in the architecture of St. Petersburg of the 18 th century, as well as a unique handwriting of the architects who worked in that era...|$|R

The six topics are geometry as the scientific foundation of architecture; humanism, antiquarianism, and the recovery of ancient architecture; architectural histories {{and the creation of}} an all’antica architecture; the canonization of the architectural orders; the production of architectural theory; and disegno and the use of architectural drawings. Intellectual history, rather than an art history of styles, is the general approach. It begins with a history of the term “Renaissance” and its application to architecture...|$|R
