5|$|If the Saxbe fix <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> for {{the primary}} problem of self-dealing, a {{relevant}} fact is that Congress has not voted to increase any Cabinet salary or benefits since the 1990s, when it granted that power to {{the president in the}} form of an across-the-board cost of living adjustment by executive order. However, the Ineligibility Clause does not distinguish between increases in emoluments by legislation, and increases by executive order. Perhaps the most lenient interpretation of self-dealing was made during the 1973 Saxbe hearings by Duke University School of Law professor William Van Alstyne, who argued that the ineligibility clause only applied to new offices created during a congressional term, not to appointments to existing offices.|$|E
5|$|The signs s1, s2 and s3 on the {{right-hand}} sides of the equations may be chosen in eight possible ways, and each choice of signs gives up to two solutions, since the equation for r's is quadratic. This might suggest (incorrectly) that there are up to sixteen solutions of Apollonius' problem. However, due to a symmetry of the equations, if (r's, x's, y's) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>solution,</b> with signs s'i, then so is (−r's, x's, y's), with opposite signs −s'i, which represents the same solution circle. Therefore, Apollonius' problem has at most eight independent solutions (Figure2). One way to avoid this double-counting is to consider only solution circles with non-negative radius.|$|E

In this context the Davydov soliton corresponds to a polaron that is (i) large so the continuum limit approximation in justified, (ii) acoustic because the self-localization arises from interactions with acoustic modes of the lattice, and (iii) weakly coupled because the anharmonic energy is small compared with the phonon bandwidth.|$|E

25|$|It is the {{disagreement}} amongst {{the advocates of}} different approaches to problems or solutions which hinders the formation of any consensual strategy and the mobilization of adequate resources.
