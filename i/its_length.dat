5|$|Little Fishing Creek is {{considered}} to be an Exceptional Value stream for part of <b>its</b> <b>length.</b> One of its tributaries {{is considered}} to be Class A Wild Trout Waters for part of <b>its</b> <b>length,</b> as is part of the creek itself. However, the creek {{is considered to}} be impaired by pathogens for a portion of <b>its</b> <b>length.</b> Parts of the creek are suitable for canoeing on.|$|E
5|$|Throughout <b>its</b> <b>length,</b> {{the highway}} gently climbs the Niagara Escarpment, {{reaching}} the top east of Stanley Avenue before crossing the Niagara Gorge. The highway {{is surrounded by}} forest to either side for most of <b>its</b> <b>length,</b> and the only settlement near it is the village of Queenston.|$|E
5|$|For much of <b>its</b> <b>length</b> the Welland {{forms the}} county {{boundary}} between Northamptonshire and Leicestershire or Rutland, and lower down between Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "square engine" [...] is {{an engine}} with a bore {{diameter}} equal to <b>its</b> stroke <b>length.</b> An engine where the bore diameter {{is larger than}} <b>its</b> stroke <b>length</b> is an oversquare engine, conversely, an engine with a bore diameter that is smaller than <b>its</b> stroke <b>length</b> is an undersquare engine.|$|R

50|$|Length of the atmosphere: The {{contraction}} {{formula is}} given by , where L0 is the proper length of the atmosphere and L <b>its</b> contracted <b>length.</b> As the atmosphere is at rest in S, we have γ=1 and <b>its</b> proper <b>Length</b> L0 is measured. As it is in motion in S′, we have γ>1 and <b>its</b> contracted <b>length</b> L′ is measured.|$|R
5|$|Media (M) – M is unbranched, in forewing M is fused with Rs {{for part}} of <b>its</b> <b>length.</b>|$|E
5|$|Roaring Brook is {{designated}} as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery for part of <b>its</b> <b>length</b> and a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery for {{the other part of}} <b>its</b> <b>length.</b> It is also Class A Wild Trout Waters from the Hollister Dam to the Elmhurst Reservoir. Numerous macroinvertebrate taxa have been observed in the stream and boreal forest trees inhabit wetlands in the watershed. A 12-mile (19-kilometer) rail trail connecting the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail to the Poconos via the Roaring Brook Corridor has been proposed.|$|E
5|$|The A82 has a {{wide variety}} of {{junctions}} along <b>its</b> <b>length,</b> ranging from high-quality grade-separated interchanges near Glasgow, to simple T-junctions in the Scottish Highlands.|$|E
5000|$|An antenna {{which is}} shorter than <b>its</b> {{resonant}} <b>length</b> {{is described as}} [...] "electrically short", and exhibits capacitive reactance. Similarly, an antenna which is longer than <b>its</b> resonant <b>length</b> is described as [...] "electrically long" [...] and exhibits inductive reactance.|$|R
50|$|Hooke's law of {{elasticity}} {{states that}} the extension of an elastic rod (<b>its</b> distended <b>length</b> minus <b>its</b> relaxed <b>length)</b> is linearly proportional to its tension, the force used to stretch it. Similarly, the contraction (negative extension) {{is proportional to the}} compression (negative tension).|$|R

5|$|Thompson {{begins by}} showing that an animal's surface and volume (or weight) {{increase}} with the square and cube of <b>its</b> <b>length,</b> respectively, and deducing simple rules for how bodies will change with size. He shows {{in a few short}} equations that the speed of a fish or ship rises with the square root of <b>its</b> <b>length.</b> He then derives the slightly more complex scaling laws for birds or aircraft in flight. He shows that an organism thousands of times smaller than a bacterium is essentially impossible.|$|E

5|$|A {{standard}} analogy for compactification is {{to consider}} a multidimensional object such as a garden hose. If the hose is viewed from a sufficient distance, {{it appears to have}} only one dimension, <b>its</b> <b>length,</b> but as one approaches the hose, one discovers that it contains a second dimension, its circumference. Thus, an ant crawling inside it would move in two dimensions.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} {{has been}} mixed, but generally negative. Contemporary historians, such as Charles B. MacDonald, praised the work– although some did comment on <b>its</b> <b>length.</b> Modern reviewers have identified inconsistencies or {{errors in the}} material, based on later declassified records. Also, some of Brown's personal conclusions have been questioned.|$|E
5|$|Due to <b>its</b> <b>length</b> {{and musical}} scope, most reviews of Exile on Main St. glossed over the album's {{individual}} songs {{to focus on}} the album as a whole. However, Lenny Kaye, in his review for Rolling Stone, took a paragraph to describe the song.|$|E
50|$|An isomorph is an {{organism}} {{that does not}} change in shape during growth. The implication is that its volume is proportional to <b>its</b> cubed <b>length,</b> and <b>its</b> surface area to <b>its</b> squared <b>length.</b> This holds for any shape it might have; the actual shape determines the proportionality constants.|$|R

5|$|Fleet Street has a {{significant}} number of monuments and statues along <b>its</b> <b>length,</b> including the dragon at Temple Bar and memorials to a number of figures from the British press, such as Samuel Pepys and Lord Northcliffe.

5|$|Like other insects, beetles have open circulatory systems, {{based on}} {{hemolymph}} rather than blood. As in other insects, a segmented tube-like heart {{is attached to}} the dorsal wall of the hemocoel. It has paired inlets or ostia at intervals down <b>its</b> <b>length,</b> and circulates the hemolymph from the main cavity of the haemocoel and out through the anterior cavity in the head.|$|E
50|$|The Blue River {{is a small}} {{river in}} the South Island of New Zealand.

5|$|The City of London has {{assessed}} {{the entire length}} of the Veterans Memorial Parkway, identifying areas where interchanges can be constructed, grade separations can occur, and where cul-de-sacs can be placed.

5|$|The M54 is a 23-mile (37km) east-west {{motorway}} in the English {{counties of}} Shropshire and Staffordshire.

The motorway cost £65million to construct, and is two-lane dual carriageway for the majority of <b>its</b> <b>length,</b> with sections of three-lane.|$|E
