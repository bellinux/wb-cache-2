5|$|Lynch {{has focused}} on trade policy as a congressman. In 2002 he voted against fast track bills which gave the {{president}} the authority to negotiate trade deals without amendments by Congress.

5|$|Due to {{the limited}} form of {{judicial}} review available under the ISA, whether a person remains under detention depends largely on the Ministry of Home Affairs. This raises the question quis custodiet ipsos custodes? – who guards the guardians? If preventive detention is applied illegitimately {{in a manner that}} cripples lawful <b>democratic</b> <b>opposition,</b> the absence of judicial review would preclude the exposure of such abuse. It has been submitted that the voice of public opinion is most suited for this purpose.|$|E

He ran on the ticket of three-time former president Arnulfo Arias (no relation) in the 1984 election as the National Alliance of Opposition's candidate for Second Vice President. Arnulfo Arias was narrowly defeated by Noriega ally Nicolás Ardito Barletta Vallarino, and the opposition stated that the election had been fraudulent.|$|E
5|$|On trade policy, Neal has a {{moderate}} record, supporting lower trade barriers. He {{voted against the}} North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1993. In 1995 and 2002 he voted against fast track bills which gave the president the authority to negotiate trade deals without amendments by Congress. In 2007 he {{voted in favor of}} the United States – Peru Trade Promotion Agreement despite some <b>Democratic</b> <b>opposition.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Assembly created a new, heavily Republican 6th District in Fulton and Cobb {{counties}} in the wealthy northern suburbs of Atlanta—-an area that Gingrich had never represented. Gingrich sold his home in Carrollton and moved to Marietta in the new 6th. His primary opponent, State Representative Herman Clark, made an issue out of Gingrich's 22 overdraft checks in the House Bank Scandal, and also criticized Gingrich for moving into the district. After a recount, Gingrich prevailed by 980 votes, with a 51% to 49% result. His winning the primary all but assured him of election in November. He was re-elected three times from this district against nominal <b>Democratic</b> <b>opposition.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1878 Long unsuccessfully {{challenged}} the incumbent Rice for the gubernatorial nomination. When Rice {{announced his retirement}} the following year, Long again sought the nomination. It went to former Lieutenant Governor Thomas Talbot, but Long won the lieutenant governor nomination by acclamation. The <b>Democratic</b> <b>opposition</b> was divided by Benjamin Butler's return to that party, and the Republican ticket won the general election. Long capitalized on Talbot's avoidance of public ceremonies to maintain a high profile despite his post's relative unimportance. He was easily nominated for governor when Talbot announced he would not run for reelection, {{despite a lack of}} support from the party leadership. The election was highly divisive, pitting Long against Butler and the divided Democrats. Long was criticized for his lack of Civil War service and attacked for his diversions from the party line, but won a comfortable victory. He was reelected by comfortable margins the two following years.|$|E
5|$|Later in that year, the {{collaboration}} between monarch and premier, {{coupled with the}} fact that Tătărescu had successfully attracted nationalist votes from the Iron Guard, led to the signing of an electoral agreement between the latter, the National Peasants' Party (the main <b>democratic</b> <b>opposition</b> group), and the National Liberal Party-Brătianu — the pact was meant to prevent all attempt by Carol to manipulate the votes in elections. (A secondary and unexpected development was that the illegal PCR, which had decided to back the National Peasants' Party prior to the elections, eventually supported the electoral pact.) Tătărescu's own alliance policy rose the anger of his opponents inside the PNL, as he signed collaboration agreements with the fascist Romanian Front and German Party.|$|E
5|$|The fusion effort {{failed and}} Grant was easily reelected. Liberal Republicans {{were unable to}} deliver many votes, and Greeley was only {{successful}} in areas the Democrats would have carried without him. Federal prosecution of the Klan, a strong economy, debt reduction, lowered tariffs, repeal of the income tax, and civil service reforms helped Grant defeat Greeley. Grant won 56 {{percent of the popular}} vote and an Electoral College landslide of 286 to 66. A majority of African Americans in the South voted for Grant, while <b>Democratic</b> <b>opposition</b> remained mostly peaceful. Grant lost in six former slave states that wanted to see an end to Reconstruction. In 1873 Wilson suffered a stroke; never fully recovering, he died in office on November 22, 1875. With Wilson's loss, Grant relied on Fish's guidance more than ever.|$|E

5|$|The {{warning was}} appropriate, {{for in the}} Congressional elections, Republicans won their biggest {{landslide}} in decades, taking full control of the House, while the Populists lost most of their support. Cleveland's factional enemies gained control of the Democratic Party in state after state, including full control in Illinois and Michigan, and made major gains in Ohio, Indiana, Iowa and other states. Wisconsin and Massachusetts {{were two of the}} few states that remained under the control of Cleveland's allies. The <b>Democratic</b> <b>opposition</b> were close to controlling two-thirds of the vote at the 1896 national convention, which they needed to nominate their own candidate. They failed for lack of unity and a national leader, as Illinois governor John Peter Altgeld had been born in Germany and was ineligible to be nominated for President.|$|E
5|$|Milošević's term {{in office}} in Yugoslavia {{was coming to an}} end, and the {{elections}} that came on September 24, 2000, were protested due to allegations of fraud and rigged elections. This all came to a head on October 5 in the so-called Bulldozer Revolution. Milošević resigned on October 7. The <b>Democratic</b> <b>Opposition</b> of Serbia won a majority in parliamentary elections that December. Milošević was taken into custody on April 1, 2001, and transferred to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia on June 28 to face charges of war crimes and genocide. Clark was called to testify in a closed session of Milošević's trial in December 2003. He testified on issues ranging from the Srebrenica massacre to conversations Clark had had with Milošević during his career. Some anti-war activist groups also label Clark and Bill Clinton (along with several others) as war criminals for NATO's entire bombing campaign, saying the entire operation was in violation of the NATO charter.|$|E
5|$|Randall's {{determination}} to cut spending, combined with Southern Democrats' desire to reduce federal power {{in their home}} states, led the House to pass an army appropriation bill with a rider that repealed the Enforcement Acts, which {{had been used to}} suppress the Ku Klux Klan. The Enforcement Acts, passed during Reconstruction over <b>Democratic</b> <b>opposition,</b> made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because of his race. Hayes was determined to preserve the law protecting black voters, and he vetoed the appropriation. The Democrats did not have enough votes to override the veto, but they passed a new bill with the same rider. Hayes vetoed this as well, and the process was repeated three times more. Finally, Hayes signed an appropriation without the rider, but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals, who were vital to the enforcement of the Enforcement Acts. The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were curtailed. Randall's role in the process was limited, but the Democrats' failure to force Hayes's acquiescence weakened his appeal as a potential presidential candidate in 1880.|$|E
