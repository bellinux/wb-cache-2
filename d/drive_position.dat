5000|$|In 1955, Packard {{switched}} to a new V8 engine from its traditional straight-8, and launched a new evolution of its automatic transmission at the same time, the Twin-Ultramatic Drive. McFarland, his assistant John DeLorean, and their team were {{not satisfied with the}} improved pick-up of the Gear-Start Ultramatic, and modified the angle of the converter [...] "pump" [...] to allow a higher stall speed thus increasing the torque multiplication better suited to the torque curve of the new V8 engines. In addition, a slightly higher stall converter was produced for the sportier Caribbean model due to its use of two four-barrel carburetors. The Gear-Start's ability to start in low range and switch to high automatically was retained, but the selector quadrant indicator was altered and PN•DLR became PN'D'LR to better reflect the dual drive range capability of this transmission, all the better to compete with the Dual-Range Hydra-Matic. Functionality was the same; the first <b>Drive</b> <b>position,</b> to left of the 'D equated to High on the Gear-Start Ultramatic, while the second, situated to the right of D', was equivalent to the <b>Drive</b> <b>position</b> on the Gear-Start, giving the driver the option of starting in either High or Low with automatic upshifts, ending with Direct Drive engagement of the torque converter, thus the Twin- designation referred to this dual Drive capability.|$|E

We show that ATP-dependent active nucleosome sliding and nucleosome removal processes {{are essential to}} obtain in vivo-like nucleosome positioning. While active sliding leads to dense nucleosome filling, sliding events alone cannot ensure sequence-dependent nucleosome positioning: Active nucleosome removal is the crucial remodeling event that <b>drives</b> <b>positioning.</b> We also show that remodeling activity changes nucleosome dynamics from glassy to liquid-like, and that remodeling dramatically influences exposure dynamics of promoter regions...|$|R

5000|$|After a brief stint, Brutus left WPLJ-FM {{to begin}} his first ever {{full-time}} on-air hosting job at WHJY in Providence, Rhode Island. It was at this juncture that he began his trademark of closing his radio programs with a quote from writer Hunter S. Thompson. He met with Thompson twice during this time during appearances by the author at the Somerville Theater outside of Boston, Massachusetts. They stayed in contact until Thompson's death in 2005 including Brutus' unsuccessful attempts to convince the author to host a hybrid music/political program on XM Satellite Radio. Brutus was let go from WHJY {{in the spring of}} 1992. He did return for one night in 2003 to host a memorial edition of The Metal Zone in honor of his friend Mike [...] "Dr. Metal" [...] Gonsalves who perished in The Station Nightclub Fire. Shortly after his departure from WHJY, Brutus joined the staff of WBCN-FM in Boston, Massachusetts where he worked weekend and fill in shifts. By fall of that year, Brutus was back at WMMR-FM in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania as host of the night shift. He remained in this capacity until offered the afternoon <b>drive</b> <b>position</b> at WRCX-FM in Chicago, Illinois.|$|E
5000|$|The M-3x {{has three}} forward and one reverse gears. The {{selector}} lever {{varies depending on}} years and car models the transmission is used in. All models follow a quadrant which has six stations. Early models have two drive positions marked with a [...] "2" [...] and a [...] "1" [...] (P-R-N-D2-D1-L; Park, Reverse, Neutral, D2, D1 and Lock). These models start off in Second gear when in the D2 position. This is useful for economy in relatively flat terrain and for starting on slippery surfaces (wet mud, snow, ice, etc.). When placed in the D1 position the transmission shifts through all three forward gears. In [...] "Lock" [...] the transmission can be locked to prevent upward gear changes and will provide maximum engine braking in 1st gear and moderate engine braking in 2nd gear. By selecting L from stationary, or before an upward gear change into 2nd gear, the transmission will become locked in 1st gear. By selecting L from D2 or D1 while in 2nd gear, the transmission will become locked in 2nd gear or from D2 or D1 when cruising below 55 m.p.h (88 k.p.h.) will effect an immediate downward change and lock in 2nd gear. In both these instances, the transmission will automatically change down into 1st gear when the car speed drops below 5 m.p.h. (8 k.p.h.). Should 1st gear be required earlier, reduce the car speed to below 30 m.p.h. (48 k.p.h.) and effect a [...] "kick-down" [...] gear change. Many people assume they have a two speed transmission because they expect the first <b>Drive</b> <b>position</b> (D2) to shift through all three gears as all automatic transmissions have done since 1968. Some vehicles had the same system without the D1 and D2, instead just having D, and only 5 stations on the quadrant.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo {{characterize}} elastic {{properties and}} geometrical parameters of individual, whole myosin molecules during their interaction with actin we sparsely adsorbed myosin molecules to nanometer-sized microspheres. Thermally <b>driven</b> <b>position</b> fluctuations of these microspheres were recorded with the three-dimensional detection scheme of the photonic force microscope. Upon binding of single myosin molecules to immobilized actin filaments {{in the absence}} of ATP, these thermally <b>driven</b> <b>position</b> fluctuations of the microspheres change significantly. From three-dimensional position fluctuations stiffness and geometrical information of the tethering molecule can be derived. Axial stiffness was found to be asymmetric, ∼ 0. 04 pN/nm for extension, ∼ 0. 004 pN/nm for compression. Observed stiffness of whole myosin molecules is much less than estimated for individual myosin heads in muscle fibers or for single-molecule studies on myosin fragments. The stiffness reported here, however, is identical to stiffness found in other single-molecule studies with full-length myosin suggesting that the source of this low stiffness is located outside the myosin head domain. Analysis of geometrical properties of tethering myosin molecules by Brownian dynamics computer simulations suggests a linker length of ∼ 130 nm that is divided by a free hinge located ∼ 90 nm above the substrate. This pivot location coincides with myosin’s hinge region. We demonstrate the general applicability of thermal fluctuation analysis to determine elastic properties and geometrical factors of individual molecules...|$|R

5000|$|The design {{featured}} a belt clutch and a transmission {{which could be}} engaged to spin the rotor blades to high speed before take-off to produce short takeoff runs. A lever on the rear cockpit wall would select the <b>drive</b> <b>position</b> for the transmission. A single [...] "spin-up lever" [...] on the cockpit left side would then be pressed downward, operating as a collective pitch control to put the blades into flat pitch while simultaneously tensioning the belt clutch. The rotor could be spun to over 500 rpm before takeoff, well above the normal flight range (typically 425 rpm). Release of the spin-up lever would disengage both the clutch and the transmission, while placing the blades into flight pitch. After a very brief takeoff run (typically 25 to 200 feet, depending upon load and winds) adequate flight airspeed would be attained, while the rotor speed decayed to the normal flight range. The rotor was not engine-driven in flight. A strong spring resisted accidental depressing of the spin-up lever while airborne. Dual controls were provided for all functions except the spin-up lever, which was accessible only from the left seat. The aircraft enjoyed nimble handling with light control forces, but suffered from a shallow climb gradient.Early versions were equipped with a two-bladed wooden Sensenich propeller. A later [...] "Super J-2" [...] variant employed a three-bladed Hartzell controllable-pitch propeller, accompanied {{by an increase in}} allowable gross weight. Baggage of up to 95 pounds, to the extent permitted by gross weight considerations, could be carried in a large bay under the seat. Fuel was carried in tanks in the stub wings. A total of 24 U.S. gallons could be carried, 12 on each side, but only 20 were usable through normal flight attitudes. At a typical fuel burn rate of about eight gallons per hour and economy cruise at about 85 mph, with a need for a safety reserve, this limited the aircraft's range.|$|E
