No.142 {{was the home}} of radical publisher and physician John Chapman, who published contemporary authors from this house during the 1850s and edited the journal Westminster Review from 1851. George Eliot lived at No.142 between 1851 and 1855. Virginia Woolf regularly travelled along the Strand, and a King's College building named after her is in nearby Kingsway.|$|E

25|$|The area {{remained}} a farming area, mostly with family plots {{through the rest}} of the colonial period. During the Mexican War of Independence, there was restlessness <b>here</b> <b>among</b> the population, but no major incidents. In 1812, a number of natives from here fought in the war under Leonardo Bravo in other places. The municipality was mostly likely founded in 1824 along with the founding of Mexico State. U.S. troops passed through here during the Mexican-American War. In 1833, Amecameca was part of the state of Mexico in the eastern prefecture. In 1861, the settlement gained official town status from the state due to its historical and economic importance. The municipal palace was built in 1899.|$|E

25|$|The {{books of}} those that wrote before us survive, and {{therefore}} we are taught about what was written then. For this reason it is good that we also in our time, <b>here</b> <b>among</b> us, write some material from scratch, inspired by the example of these old customs; so that it might, when we are dead and elsewhere, {{be left to the}} world's ear in the time coming after this. But because men say, and it's true, that when someone writes entirely about wisdom, it often dulls a man's wit who reads it every day. For that reason, if you permit it, I would like to take the middle way, and write a book between the two, somewhat of passion, somewhat of instruction, that whether of high or low status, people may like what I write about.|$|E

500|$|Thutmose I was {{originally}} buried and then reburied in KV20 {{in a double}} burial with his daughter Hatshepsut rather than KV38 which {{could only have been}} built for Thutmose I during the reign of his grandson Thutmose III based on [...] "a recent re-examination of the architecture and contents of KV38." [...] The location of KV20, if not its original owner, had long been known since the Napoleonic expedition of 1799 and, in 1844, the Prussian scholar Karl Richard Lepsius had partially explored its upper passage. However, all its passageways [...] "had become blocked by a solidified mass of rubble, small stones and rubbish which had been carried into the tomb by floodwaters" [...] and {{it was not until the}} 1903-1904 excavation season that Howard Carter, after 2 previous seasons of strenuous work, was able to clear its corridors and enter its double burial chamber. <b>Here,</b> <b>among</b> the debris of broken pottery and shattered stone vessels from the burial chamber and lower passages were the remnants of two vases made for Queen Ahmose Nefertari which formed part of the original funerary equipment of Thutmose I; one of the vases contained a secondary inscription which states that Thutmose II [...] " [...] as his monument to his father." [...] Other vessels which bore the names and titles of Thutmose I had also been inscribed by his son and successor, Thutmose II, as well as fragments of stone vessels made for Hatshepsut before she herself became king as well as other vessels which bore her royal name of 'Maatkare' which would have been made only after she took the throne in her own right.|$|E

500|$|In {{the palace}} at Ithaca, Penelope mourns the long absence of Ulysses: [...] "The awaited {{one does not}} return, and the years pass by." [...] Her grief is echoed by her nurse, Ericlea. As Penelope leaves, her {{attendant}} Melanto enters with Eurimaco, a servant to Penelope's importunate suitors. The two sing passionately of their {{love for each other}} ("You are my sweet life"). The scene changes to the Ithacan coast, where the sleeping Ulisse is brought ashore by the Phaecians (Faeci), whose action is in defiance of the wishes of gods Giove and Nettuno. The Phaecians are punished by the gods who turn them and their ship to stone. Ulysses awakes, cursing the Phaecians for abandoning him: [...] "To your sails, falsest Phaeacians, may Boreas be ever hostile!" [...] From the goddess Minerva, who appears disguised as a shepherd boy, Ulisse learns that he is in Ithaca, and is told of [...] "the unchanging constancy of the chaste Penelope", {{in the face of the}} persistent importunings of her evil suitors. Minerva promises to lead Ulisse back to the throne if he follows her advice; she tells him to disguise himself so that he can penetrate the court secretly. Ulisse goes to seek out his loyal servant Eumete, while Minerva departs to search for Telemaco, Ulisse's son who will help his father reclaim the kingdom. Back at the palace, Melanto tries vainly to persuade Penelope to choose one of the suitors: [...] "Why do you disdain the love of living suitors, expecting comfort from the ashes of the dead?" [...] In a wooded grove Eumete, banished from court by the suitors, revels in the pastoral life, despite the mockery of Iro, the suitors' parasitic follower, who sneers: [...] "I live among kings, you <b>here</b> <b>among</b> the herds." [...] After Iro is chased away, Ulisse enters disguised as a beggar, and assures Eumete that his master the king is alive, and will return. Eumete is overjoyed: [...] "My long sorrow will fall, vanquished by you." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kartini was {{the fifth}} child and second eldest {{daughter}} {{in a family of}} eleven, including half siblings. She was born into a family with a strong intellectual tradition. Her grandfather, Pangeran Ario Tjondronegoro IV, became a Regency Chief at the age of 25, while Kartini's older brother Sosrokartono was an accomplished linguist. Kartini's family allowed her to attend school until she was 12 years old. <b>Here,</b> <b>among</b> other subjects, she learnt to speak Dutch, an unusual accomplishment for Javanese women at the time. After she turned 12 she was secluded (pingit) at home, a common practice among Javanese nobility, to prepare young girls for their marriage. [...] During seclusion girls were not allowed to leave their parents' house until they were married, at which point authority over them was transferred to their husbands. Kartini's father was more lenient than some during his daughter's seclusion, giving her such privileges as embroidery lessons and occasional appearances in public for special events.|$|E
