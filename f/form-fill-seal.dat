50|$|Blister packs {{are created}} {{by means of a}} <b>form-fill-seal</b> process at the {{pharmaceutical}} company or designated contract packer. A <b>form-fill-seal</b> process means that the blister pack is created from rolls of flat sheet or film, filled with the pharmaceutical product and closed (sealed) on the same equipment. Such equipment is called a blisterline. There are two types of blister machine' design: rotary and flat-plate, depending on the mechanism for sealing the lidding foil.|$|E

When the center of the plastic is near the tube, the outer edges of the film form flaps that wrap around the conical forming tube. The film is pulled downward around the outside of the tube and {{a vertical}} heat-sealing bar clamps onto the edges of the film to create the [...] "fin Seal", bonding the film by melting the seam edges together.|$|E

These are <b>Form-Fill-Seal</b> style machines that form the package from rolls of packaging film (webbing). Products are loaded into the thermoformed pockets, the top web is laid and sealed under a vacuum, producing vacuum packaged products. Thermoforming can greatly increase packaging production speed.Thermoformed plastics can be customized for size, color, clarity, and shape to fit products perfectly, creating a consistent appearance.Some common uses for Thermoforming in vacuum packaging include: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{feeding of}} {{material}} and cutting of the bag/pouch can be determined either by pouch length, or by indexing to an eyespot (photo registration mark), which is detected by a visual sensor. While single web systems are popular for food applications, the dual web four side seal system is often popular for IVD and Medical device products. Closely related is the horizontal <b>form-fill-seal</b> machine, which generally uses more floor space than a vertical system. Modern advancements in pouch forming technology have allowed for smaller and smaller Vertical pouch forming systems.|$|E
40|$|Vertical <b>form–fill–seal</b> (VFFS) {{machines}} {{are widely used}} to form bags for packaging products such as confectionary and snack food. One critical component of the machine is the forming shoulder, which needs to manipulate, without damage, the packaging material from a flat state into a tube. Some models of the geometry of the shoulder are available and {{have been used to}} help with its design and manufacture. However, there currently exists no theoretical basis for determining the geometry of the forming shoulder needed to process particular packaging materials. This paper investigates the application of Euler's theory for material flow around cylinders to the case of forming shoulders used in vertical <b>form–fill–seal</b> systems. It is shown that the theory is indeed applicable, and an inequality relation between the measured coefficient of friction of the material and the forming shoulder parameters is established. It is further shown how this can be used to direct the design of a forming shoulder for a particular application...|$|E
40|$|Packaging {{and storage}} are the final phases {{in the food}} industry. Quality preservation, {{improving}} safety and reduction of postharvest losses waste are some objectives of the packaging engineering. One of techniques that widely used in packaging {{of fruits and vegetables}} are modified atmosphere packaging (MAP). In MAP for fresh fruits and vegetable the air of packaging headspace replaces with a predetermined atmospheric gases different in proportion from that of air. Oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen are the main gases used in MAP for injection to the headspace of pack. The choice and ratio of gases are very dependent upon the material that being packed. respiration rate of crop, O 2 and CO 2 permeability of package material, volume of headspace present inside the package and storage temperature are some factors that affect the quality of MA packaging. Polymeric films are widely used in MAP engineering. The most application of polymeric films for MAP are in flexible package structures. In many cases the plastic packaging films are combined with one another or with other materials such as paper or aluminum through coating, lamination, coextrusion and metallization processes. The equipment used in MAP is divided into two main categories: pillow wrap and chamber. Flexible pillow wrapping machines are composed of Horizontal <b>Form-Fill-Seal</b> (HFFS) machines and Vertical <b>Form-Fill-Seal</b> (VFFS) systems. This paper reviews some recent developments in MAP technology applied for fruits and vegetables...|$|E
40|$|The present work of thesis makes {{reference}} to a real Italian pasta firm which produces in Italy and export its products {{all over the world}} working for the untiring improvement of its portfolio and the consolidation of its position in the market. The firm has a production capacity of 60. 000 tons/year and it works only for its Brand. The exportation covers over 60 % of the production with a widespread distribution to more than 50 countries: 65 % of the exportation is towards Europe, 25 % is toward America, 10 % is toward Asia and Oceania. In the last years the firm has increased its presence into markets with a huge potential. The production line is accessorized with four packaging lines: two packaging lines for long pasta and two packaging lines for short pasta. Each short pasta line is equipped by an automatic Vertical <b>Form-Fill-Seal</b> (VFFS) packaging machines filled by a multi-head weigher. Both the VFFS machines construct plastic bags in the classic 0, 5 kg “pillow” bag. The company has decided to replace its Vertical <b>Form-Fill-Seal</b> (VFFS) packaging machines, which are becoming strongly obsolete, with new machines. The replacement of the manufacturing equipments is considerate by the company {{as one of the most}} important strategic decisions faced in the last period. This is because the purchase of new equipments will involve significant costs and will affect the productivity and competitiveness of the firm into the future. In our work we are going to help the company in this strategic replacement decision...|$|E

Filling from cups with different opening mechanisms and filling systems using an auger have been examined, and the dosing accuracy found in all instances to be more dependent on variations in the bulk density, general particle shape and size etc. of the product being filled than on the dimensions etc. of the filling device. Results are reported on many of the possible characteristics in an attempt to find the relevant one(s) but it is concluded that our knowledge of product characteristics is insufficient and that more research is required.

40|$|The {{machinability}} of {{packaging materials}} in <b>form-fill-seal</b> machines differs {{to a great}} extent when using either the draw-down-belt system or the draw-bar system. The transport of the web with sealing bars is mainly determined by the bending stiffness, the friction coefficient and the tensile strength of the web. On the other hand the friction coefficient of both sides of the packaging material with the different machine elements are the decisive machinability factors for the transport in draw-down belt systems. A slipping of the web can only be avoided when the draw condition for the draw-down belt system is fulfilled. The bending stiffness plays an indirect, the tensile strength a subordinate role in this connection, because the web generally begins to slip under the influence of forces, which do not reach the level necessary to affect the mechanical strength of the packaging web...|$|E
