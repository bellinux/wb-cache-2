5|$|After a model dies while {{undergoing}} {{an illegal}} abortion, a killer disguised in a motorcycle helmet tracks down and kills the doctor involved. Several models and photographers {{working at the}} same agency as the dead girl are also murdered, leading two surviving photographers to fear <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> {{as they try to}} track down the killer.|$|E
5|$|On 18 December 1944 Massachusetts and {{the other}} ships of TF 38 {{unexpectedly}} {{found themselves in a}} fight <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> when Typhoon Cobra overtook the force.

5|$|Across the Narrow Sea, {{siblings}} Viserys (Harry Lloyd) and Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) – {{the exiled}} {{children of the}} last king of the original ruling dynasty, who was overthrown by Robert Baratheon – are running <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> and trying to win back the throne. Daenerys has been married to Khal Drogo (Jason Momoa), {{the leader of the}} nomadic Dothraki. Her retinue includes exiled knight Ser Jorah Mormont (Iain Glen), her aide Missandei (Nathalie Emmanuel) and the sellsword Daario Naharis (Michiel Huisman).|$|E
5|$|Lladron Maelrhys are {{two large}} stones {{on the border}} between Llanfaelrhys and Y Rhiw. It is claimed that, years ago, thieves broke into St Maelrhys Church, intent on {{stealing}} money. Caught in the act, they fled <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> but were caught as they approached Y Rhiw, and killed on the spot; the stones mark their burial place. Another version claims that as they crossed the parish boundary they were turned to stone for their sacrilege.|$|E
5|$|Many motifs {{are used}} in {{traditional}} kilims, handmade flat-woven rugs, each with many variations. In Turkish Anatolia in particular, village women wove themes significant <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> into their rugs, whether before marriage or during married life. Some motifs represent desires, such as for happiness and children; others, for protection against threats such as wolves (to the flocks) and scorpions, or against the evil eye. These motifs were often combined when woven into patterns on kilims. With the fading of tribal and village cultures in the 20th century, the meaning of kilim patterns has faded also.|$|E

5|$|Shapiro {{responds}} to Goodin's argument by challenging his factual assumption that individuals would starve if they refused the workfare throffer. In state-sponsored (see welfare state) workfare systems, he claims, only monetary assistance is eliminated by {{a refusal to}} accept the throffer, while in private systems (that is, non-state charities or organisations offering conditional aid), other groups than the one operating a workfare system exist. In either system, recipients of welfare may also turn {{to family and friends}} for help. For these reasons, he does not consider the throffer to be unrefusable in the cases in which Goodin believes it is. A second (and, Shapiro claims, more important) objection is also presented. State welfare without sanctions fails to mirror the way that working individuals who do not rely on welfare payments take responsibility <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> If a person who works stops working, Shapiro observes, then they will typically find their economic situation worsened. Unconditional state welfare does not reflect this, and instead reflects the unusual position of the person who would be no worse off if they refused to work. As unconditional welfare does not mirror the situation of ordinary workers, it is unable {{to determine whether or not}} people are willing to take responsibility <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Earl of Argyll later {{secured the}} {{submission}} of Colla Ciotach MacDonald, who was another chief of Clan Donald South. Colla Ciotach then captured Malcolm Macfie of Colonsay, among eighteen others, {{and handed them}} over to the Earl of Argyll. Malcolm Macfie, along with another rebel leader, received assurance <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> by serving on the Government's side against the rebels while in the company of the Earl of Argyll. The Earl, in late 1615, presented the captured to the Privy Council.|$|E
5|$|Witnesses at {{the scene}} {{described}} several intermittent shots fired from both sides before the lines of regulars began to fire volleys without receiving orders to do so.

The rest ran <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b>|$|E

5|$|After a mine cart chase {{to escape}} the temple, the trio emerge above ground and are again cornered by Mola Ram and his henchmen on a rope bridge high above a crocodile-infested river. Using a sword, Indy cuts the rope bridge in half, leaving {{everyone}} to hang on <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> Indy utters an incantation which causes the stones to glow red hot. Two of the stones fall into the river, while the last falls into Mola Ram's hand, burning his hand. Indy catches the now-cool stone, while Mola Ram falls into the river below and gets devoured by hungry crocodiles. The Thuggees then attempt to shoot Indy with arrows, until a company of British Indian Army riflemen, summoned by the Maharajah, arrive and open fire on the Thuggee archers. Indy, Willie, and Shorty return to the village with the children and give the missing stone back to the villagers.|$|E
5|$|After obtaining {{permission}} from the Mexican government to mount an expedition into Indian territory {{to search for the}} legendary silver mine, Bowie, his brother Rezin, and ten others set out for San Saba on November 2, 1831. Six miles (10km) from their goal, the group stopped to negotiate with a large raiding party of Indians—reportedly more than 120 Tawakoni and Waco, plus another 40 Caddo. The attempts at parley failed and Bowie and his group fought <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> for the next 13hours. When the Indians finally retreated, Bowie reportedly had lost only one man, while more than 40Indians had been killed and 30 were wounded. In the meantime, a party of friendly Comanche rode into San Antonio bringing word of the raiding party, which outnumbered the Bowie expedition by 14 to 1. The citizens of San Antonio believed the members of the Bowie expedition must have perished, and Ursula Bowie began wearing widow's weeds.|$|E
5|$|Around 1:00am (evidence on {{the precise}} time conflicts) on Monday, 8 January, a {{rumbling}} or cracking noise was {{heard from the}} vessel, followed shortly by a huge explosion within its hull. The force of the explosion was seen to blow men from the jetty into the sea. Local residents reported seeing Betelgeuse engulfed in a ball of fire a few moments later. A series of further explosions followed, breaking the vessel in half. Much of the oil cargo still on board ignited and this generated temperatures estimated to exceed 1,000°C. The concrete unloading jetty crumbled and firefighters, arriving on the scene from several neighbouring towns, were unable to get near the vessel. The firefighters concentrated their efforts on preventing the fire from spreading to the tanks of the storage farm and on containing the oil spillage. Local families living on the island fled <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b>|$|E

5|$|However, {{when they}} reached the American compound, Lownds refused to give them entry because he feared that North Vietnamese {{soldiers}} may have mingled with the crowd. Instead, Lownds ordered his soldiers to herd the civilians into bomb craters, disarmed the local soldiers, and kept them under guard even though North Vietnamese artillery shells continued to rain down on the base. No food or medical aid was given to the civilians as they were kept outside the wires of the American compound. Frustrated by the lack of support and poor treatment by the Americans, Phetsampou complained that his people were being treated more like an enemy. On 10 February, Laotian civilian refugees started walking back to Laos along Highway 9, because they feared <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> and preferred to die in their own country. On February 15, through arrangements made by the Laotian embassy in Saigon, the Laotian commander and his soldiers were flown back to their country on a Royal Laotian Air Force C-47 transport aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The camp housed about 2,000 inmates when it opened. At {{its peak}} of {{operations}} in 1944, {{a staff of}} 636 guards oversaw 25,000 permanent inmates, and an additional 150,000 people passed through the camp in {{its role as a}} transit camp. Göth personally murdered prisoners on a daily basis. His two dogs, Rolf and Ralf, were trained to tear inmates to death. He shot people from the window of his office if they appeared to be moving too slowly or resting in the yard. He shot to death a Jewish cook because the soup was too hot. He brutally mistreated his two maids, Helen Jonas-Rosenzweig and Helen Hirsch, who were in constant fear <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives,</b> as were all the inmates.|$|E
5|$|The early {{light was}} {{obscured}} {{by a black}} cloud through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to sheet lightning, but more extensive. The cloud obscured Point Misenum near at hand and the island of Capraia (Capri) across the bay. Fearing <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives,</b> the population began to call {{to each other and}} move back from the coast along the road. A rain of ash fell, causing Pliny to shake it off periodically to avoid being buried. Later that same day the pumice and ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder.|$|E

5|$|If {{the hostages}} were still {{held by the}} Scots a decade later, they may well have feared <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> For in 1275, the {{continuation}} of the twelfth-century Historia rerum Anglicarum, the thirteenthfourteenth-century Chronicle of Mann, and the fourteenth-century Chronicle of Lanercost reveal that Guðrøðr led a revolt on the island against the Scottish Crown. According to the continuation of Historia rerum Anglicarum, Guðrøðr took possession of the island's strongholds, ejecting the Scottish representatives in the process. Alexander III quickly responded by sending a great fleet, drawn from the Hebrides and Galloway, to invade the island and restore Scottish royal authority. The commanders of this enterprise were: John de Vesci (died 1289), John Comyn I, Lord of Badenoch (died c. 1277), Alan, Alasdair Mac Dubhghaill, Lord of Argyll (died 1310), and Ailéan mac Ruaidhrí (died ×1296). The identities of these men suggest that the Scottish force was composed of a small component of heavily armed knights, a contingent of infantry troops levied from the common army of Galloway, and a fleet of galleys gathered from the Hebrides.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a {{large number}} of Germans poured through the breach in the Roman {{frontline}} and charged the centre of the Roman rear line. This position was held by the elite Primani legion, which stopped the German attack in its tracks and then counterattacked, routing the breakthrough force. The breach in the front line was presumably filled, either by the separated wings of the front line reconnecting, or by the Primani advancing from the rear line (Ammianus does not specify which). The front line, now extended on the left flank by the rear line left wing, (and presumably by Severus' victorious division), began pushing the Germans back, and gradually hemmed them in from the flanks. At this point, the Germans were already exhausted and demoralised by their lack of progress and severe losses. The mass of their army was now trapped in an ever-tighter Roman crescent, with the troops on the edges being methodically cut down and the ones in the middle packed tightly together and unable to move. Finally, after more relentless pressure from the Romans, the German line collapsed: as panic spread through their ranks, the Germans broke formation and ran <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> Many did not run fast enough: pursued {{all the way to the}} Rhine by Roman cavalry and infantry, many were cut down as they ran. Large numbers attempted to swim across the river, but many drowned, hit by Roman missiles or weighed down by their armour.|$|E
5|$|Newer {{research}} {{points out}} some other intriguing possibilities regarding the early {{origins of the}} Polish state in Greater Poland. There are indications that the processes {{that led to the}} establishment of the Piast state began during the period ca. 890-910. During these years, a tremendous civilizational advancement took place in central Greater Poland, as the unearthed products of all kinds that have been discovered are better made and more elaborate. The timing coincides with the breakdown of the Great Moravian state caused by the Magyar invasions. Before and after its fall in 905-07, many Great Moravian people, fearing <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives,</b> had to escape. According to the notes made by Constantine VII, they found refuge in neighboring countries. Decorations found in Sołacz graves in Poznań have their counterparts in burial sites around Nitra in Slovakia. In the Nitra area, there was also in medieval times a well-known clan named Poznan. The above indicates that the Poznań town was established by Nitran refugees, and more generally, the immigrants from Great Moravia contributed to the sudden awakening of the otherwise remote and isolated Piast lands.|$|E
