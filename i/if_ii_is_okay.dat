An A-module is s-pure if δ(N) =s for all its non-zero noetherian submodules N, and is essentiallys-pure if it contains an essential submodule which is s-pure. Consider a minimal injective resolution of A as an A-module 0 →A→I 0 →I 1 →⋯→Id→ 0. We say A has a pure (resp. essentially pure) injective resolution <b>if</b> <b>Ii</b> <b>is</b> (d−i) -pure (resp. essentially (d−i) -pure).
