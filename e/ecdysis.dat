5|$|Caterpillars undergo <b>ecdysis</b> {{and have}} a number of larval instars, usually five but varying between species. The new cuticle is soft and allows the {{increase}} in size and development of the caterpillar before becoming hard and inelastic. In the last <b>ecdysis,</b> the old cuticle splits and curls up into a small ball at the posterior end of the pupa and is known as the larval exuvia.|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers undergo {{incomplete}} metamorphosis: they repeatedly moult (undergo <b>ecdysis),</b> each instar becoming {{larger and}} more like an adult, with the wing-buds increasing in size at each stage. The number of instars varies between species but is often six. After the final moult, the wings are inflated and become fully functional. The migratory grasshopper, Melanoplus sanguinipes, spends about 25 to 30 days as a nymph, depending on sex and temperature, and lives for about 51 days as an adult.|$|E
5|$|The {{shedding}} {{of scales}} is called <b>ecdysis,</b> or, in normal usage moulting or sloughing. In {{the case of}} snakes, the complete outer layer of skin is shed in one layer. Snake scales are not discrete but extensions of the epidermis hence they are not shed separately, but are ejected as a complete contiguous outer layer of skin during each moult, akin to a sock being turned inside out.|$|E
5|$|In mid-July, {{the female}} Polish {{cochineal}} lays approximately 600-700 eggs, encased {{with a white}} waxy ootheca, in the ground. When the larvae hatch in late August or early September, they do not leave the egg case but remain inside {{until the end of}} winter. In late March or early April, the larvae emerge from the ground to feed for a short time on the low-growing leaves of the host plant before returning underground to feed on the plant's roots. At this point, the larvae undergo <b>ecdysis,</b> shedding their exoskeletons together with their legs and antennae, and they encyst by forming outer protective coatings (cysts) within the root tissues.|$|E
5|$|The {{larval stage}} of dragonflies lasts {{up to five}} years in large species, and between two months and three years in smaller species. When the naiad is ready to {{metamorphose}} into an adult, it stops feeding and makes its way to the surface, generally at night. It remains stationary with its head out of the water, while its respiration system adapts to breathing air, then climbs up a reed or other emergent plant, and moults (<b>ecdysis).</b> Anchoring itself firmly in a vertical position with its claws, its skin begins to split at a weak spot behind the head. The adult dragonfly crawls out of its larval skin, the exuvia, arching backwards when all but the tip of its abdomen is free, to allow its exoskeleton to harden. Curling back upwards, it completes its emergence, swallowing air, which plumps out its body, and pumping haemolymph into its wings, which causes them to expand to their full extent.|$|E
25|$|Shedding. Reptiles {{shed their}} skin {{through a process}} called <b>ecdysis</b> which occurs {{continuously}} throughout their lifetime. In particular, younger reptiles tend to shed once every 5–6 weeks while adults shed 3-4 times a year. O Younger reptiles shed more because of their rapid growth rate. Once full size, the frequency of shedding drastically decreases. The process of <b>ecdysis</b> involves forming a new layer of skin under the old one. Proteolytic enzymes and lymphatic fluid is secreted between {{the old and new}} layers of skin. Consequently, this lifts the old skin from the new one allowing for shedding to occur. Snakes will shed from the head to the tail while lizards shed in a “patchy pattern”. Dysecdysis, a common skin disease in snakes and lizards will occur when <b>ecdysis,</b> or shedding, fails. There are numerous reasons why shedding fails and can be related to inadequate humidity and temperature, nutritional deficiencies, dehydration and traumatic injuries. Nutritional deficiencies decreases proteolytic enzymes while dehydration reduces lymphatic fluids to separate the skin layers. Traumatic injuries on the other hand, forms scars that will not allow new scales to form and disrupt the process of <b>ecdysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Eurypterids are a {{group of}} chelicerates that became extinct in the late Permian. They {{underwent}} <b>ecdysis</b> {{in a similar manner}} to extant chelicerates, and most fossils are thought to be of exuviae, rather than cadavers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ecdysis</b> allows damaged {{tissue and}} missing limbs to be {{regenerated}} or substantially re-formed. Complete regeneration {{may require a}} series of moults, the stump becoming a little larger with each moult until it is a normal, or near normal, size.|$|E
25|$|While the old cuticle {{is being}} digested, the new layer is secreted. All cuticular {{structures}} are shed at <b>ecdysis,</b> including the inner {{parts of the}} exoskeleton, which includes terminal linings of the alimentary tract and of the tracheae if they are present.|$|E
25|$|Once {{they are}} juvenile, Nephila inhabit their {{individual}} webs then begin the growth by molting process. The {{period of time}} between molts is called an instar and there can be 7-12 of these depending on food availability. <b>Ecdysis,</b> or the shedding of the exoskeleton occurs through {{the formation of a}} soft exoskeleton inside the current one. Once the old exoskeleton is shed the new larger one begins to harden. <b>Ecdysis</b> occurs when the spiders mass becomes too great for the current exoskeleton to support. Once they are mature male spiders seek out females for copulation and live on their webs. When mating season arrives both males and females stop molting and remain the same size for the remainder of their lives.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ecdysis</b> is the {{moulting}} of the cuticle in many invertebrates of the clade Ecdysozoa. Since the cuticle {{of these}} animals typically forms a largely inelastic exoskeleton, it is shed during growth and a new, larger covering is formed. The remnants of the old, empty exoskeleton are called exuviae.|$|E
25|$|Larvae have 3 {{pairs of}} {{legs and the}} nymphs and adults 4 pairs. Ixodes holocyclus {{requires}} three hosts to complete its life cycle, thus it is a 'three-host tick'. To moult to the next stage a blood meal must be obtained by the larva or nymph. Moulting is known as <b>ecdysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Like all hemipterans, jewel bugs undergo {{incomplete}} metamorphosis (hemimetaboly) {{and do not}} possess larval and pupal stages. Instead the adults develop from several stages (instars) of nymphs (usually five) through successive moltings (<b>ecdysis).</b> Nymphs resemble the adults except for size {{and the absence of}} wings. They can be of different coloration or patterns from adults.|$|E
25|$|Molting, or <b>ecdysis,</b> {{serves a}} number of functions. Firstly, the old and worn skin is replaced; secondly, it helps get rid of parasites such as mites and ticks. Renewal of the skin by {{moulting}} is supposed to allow growth in some animals such as insects; however, this has been disputed {{in the case of}} snakes.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the process}} of <b>ecdysis</b> is metabolically risky and expensive, it does have some advantages. For one thing it permits a complex {{development}} cycle of metamorphosis in which young animals may be totally different from older phases, such as the nauplius larvae of crustaceans, the nymphs of say, the Odonata, or the larvae of Endopterygota, such as maggots of flies. Such larval stages commonly have ecological and life cycle roles totally {{different from those of}} the mature animals. Secondly, often a major injury in one phase, such as the loss of a leg from an insect nymph, or a claw from a young crab, can be repaired after one or two stages of <b>ecdysis.</b> Similarly, delicate parts that need periodic replacement, such as the outer surfaces of the eye lenses of spiders, or the urticating hairs of caterpillars, can be shed, making way for new structures.|$|E
25|$|In {{preparation}} for <b>ecdysis,</b> the arthropod becomes inactive {{for a period}} of time, undergoing apolysis or separation of the old exoskeleton from the underlying epidermal cells. For most organisms, the resting period is a stage of preparation during which the secretion of fluid from the moulting glands of the epidermal layer and the loosening of the underpart of the cuticle occur.|$|E
25|$|The {{shedding}} {{of scales}} is called <b>ecdysis</b> (or in normal usage, molting or sloughing). In {{the case of}} snakes, the complete outer layer of skin is shed in one layer. Snake scales are not discrete, but extensions of the epidermis—hence they are not shed separately but as a complete outer layer during each molt, akin to a sock being turned inside out.|$|E
25|$|Bed bugs {{have five}} {{immature}} nymph life stages {{and a final}} sexually mature adult stage. They shed their skins through <b>ecdysis</b> at each stage, discarding their outer exoskeleton, which is somewhat clear, empty exoskeletons of the bugs themselves. Bed bugs must molt six times before becoming fertile adults, and must consume at least one blood meal to complete each molt.|$|E
25|$|Spiders {{generally}} {{change their}} skin {{for the first}} time while still inside the egg sac, and the spiderling that emerges broadly resembles the adult. The number of moults varies, both between species and genders, but generally will be between five times and nine times before the spider reaches maturity. Not surprisingly, since males are generally smaller than females, the males of many species mature faster and do not undergo <b>ecdysis</b> as many times as the females before maturing.|$|E
25|$|Nymphs usually undergo {{four to five}} {{successive}} {{stages of}} moltings (<b>ecdysis),</b> increasing in size and becoming more adult-like with each stage until the final molting. The stages are individually known as instars, with the earliest stage (just after hatching) being known as the first nymphal instar. Nymphs may also differ significantly from adults in colors and patterns exhibited. In some species, nymphs often exhibit strikingly vibrant colors {{in contrast to the}} relative drabness of adults. The colors can also vary between instars.|$|E
25|$|Eurypterus {{are very}} common fossils in their regions of occurrence, {{millions}} of specimens are {{possible in a}} given area, though access to the rock formations may be difficult. Most fossil eurypterids are the disjointed shed exoskeleton (known as exuviae) of individuals after molting (<b>ecdysis).</b> Some are complete but are most probably exuviae as well. Fossils of the actual remains of eurypterids (i.e. their carcasses) are relatively rare. Fossil eurypterids are often deposited in characteristic windrows, probably a result of wave and wind action.|$|E
25|$|After apolysis {{the insect}} {{is known as}} a pharate. Moulting fluid is then {{secreted}} into the exuvial space between the old cuticle and the epidermis, this contains inactive enzymes which are activated only after the new epicuticle is secreted. This prevents the new procuticle from getting digested as it is laid down. The lower regions of the old cuticle, the endocuticle and mesocuticle, are then digested by the enzymes and subsequently absorbed. The exocuticle and epicuticle resist digestion and are hence shed at <b>ecdysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{tracheal}} tube may contain ridge-like circumferential rings of taenidia in various geometries such as loops or helices. In the head, thorax, or abdomen, tracheae {{may also be}} connected to air sacs. Many insects, such as grasshoppers and bees, which actively pump the air sacs in their abdomen, are {{able to control the}} flow of air through their body. In some aquatic insects, the tracheae exchange gas through the body wall directly, {{in the form of a}} gill, or function essentially as normal, via a plastron. Note that despite being internal, the tracheae of arthropods are shed during moulting (<b>ecdysis).</b>|$|E
25|$|The ecdysial suture {{is made of}} the coronal, frontal, and epicranial sutures {{plus the}} ecdysial and {{cleavage}} lines, which vary among different species of insects. The ecdysial suture is longitudinally placed on the vertex and separates the epicranial halves of the head {{to the left and}} right sides. Depending on the insect, the suture may come in different shapes: like either a Y, U, or V. Those diverging lines that make up the ecdysial suture are called the frontal or frontogenal sutures. Not all species of insects have frontal sutures, but in those that do, the sutures split open during <b>ecdysis,</b> which helps provide an opening for the new instar to emerge from the integument.|$|E
25|$|The Ecdysozoa are protostomes, {{named after}} the common trait of growth by {{moulting}} or <b>ecdysis.</b> The largest animal phylum belongs here, the Arthropoda, including insects, spiders, crabs, and their kin. All these organisms have a body divided into repeating segments, typically with paired appendages. Two smaller phyla, the Onychophora and Tardigrada, are close relatives of the arthropods and share these traits. The ecdysozoans also include the Nematoda or roundworms, perhaps the second largest animal phylum. Roundworms are typically microscopic, and occur in nearly every environment where there is water. A number are important parasites. Smaller phyla related to them are the Nematomorpha or horsehair worms, and the Kinorhyncha, Priapulida, and Loricifera. These groups have a reduced coelom, called a pseudocoelom.|$|E
25|$|The young {{generally}} resemble their parents. Growth {{is accomplished}} by periodic shedding of the exoskeleton (<b>ecdysis).</b> A scorpion's developmental progress is measured in instars (how many moults it has undergone). Scorpions typically require between five and seven moults to reach maturity. Moulting commences with a split in the old exoskeleton just below {{the edge of the}} carapace (at the front of the prosoma). The scorpion then emerges from this split; the pedipalps and legs are first removed from the old exoskeleton, followed eventually by the metasoma. When it emerges, the scorpion's new exoskeleton is soft, making the scorpion highly vulnerable to attack. The scorpion must constantly stretch while the new exoskeleton hardens to ensure that it can move when the hardening is complete. The process of hardening is called sclerotisation. The new exoskeleton does not fluoresce; as sclerotisation occurs, the fluorescence gradually returns.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemical}} and physical {{nature of the}} arthropod exoskeleton limits its ability to stretch or change shape as the animal grows. In some special cases, such as the abdomens of termite queens and honeypot ants means that continuous growth of arthropods is not possible. Therefore, growth is periodic and concentrated into {{a period of time}} when the exoskeleton is shed, called moulting or <b>ecdysis,</b> which is under the control of a hormone called ecdysone. Moulting is a complex process that is invariably dangerous for the arthropod involved. Before the old exoskeleton is shed, the cuticle separates from the epidermis through a process called apolysis. New cuticle is excreted by the underlying epidermis, and mineral salts are usually withdrawn from the old cuticle for re-use. After the old cuticle is shed, the arthropod typically pumps up its body (for example, by air or water intake) to allow the new cuticle to expand to a larger size: the process of hardening by dehydration of the cuticle then takes place. A newly molted arthropod typically is pale in colour; in that state it is said to be teneral or a callow. It generally darkens or otherwise gains colour as its exoskeleton hardens.|$|E
500|$|Homarus gammarus {{is a large}} crustacean, with a {{body length}} up to [...] and {{weighing}} up to , although the lobsters caught in lobster pots are usually [...] long and weigh [...] Like other crustaceans, lobsters have a hard exoskeleton which they must shed in order to grow, in a process called <b>ecdysis</b> (moulting). This may occur {{several times a year}} for young lobsters, but decreases to once every 1–2 years for larger animals.|$|E
500|$|Males exhibit sexual {{competition}} and courting behavior. They aggressively engage in [...] "boxing matches" [...] using their large second pair of gnathopods {{in the presence}} of receptive females. These encounters often have lethal results, as the gnathopods and their poison teeth can be used to impale or slice an opponent in half. Males will also repeatedly touch the exoskeletons of the females with their antennae to detect signs of moulting (<b>ecdysis).</b> Like all crustaceans, females are only capable of mating shortly after shedding their old hardened exoskeletons.|$|E
500|$|The fertilised egg matures and hatches {{to give a}} {{caterpillar}}. The caterpillar is {{the feeding}} stage of the lepidopteran life cycle. The caterpillar {{needs to be able}} to feed and to avoid being eaten and much of its morphology has evolved to facilitate these two functions. After growth and <b>ecdysis,</b> the caterpillar enters into a [...] developmental stage called a pupa (or chrysalis) around which it may form a casing. The insect develops into the adult in the pupa stage; when ready the pupa hatches and the adult stage or imago of a butterfly or moth arises.|$|E
500|$|Lepidopterans undergo {{complete}} metamorphosis, {{going through}} a four-stage life cycle: egg; larva or caterpillar; pupa or chrysalis; and [...] / adult. The larvae – caterpillars – have a toughened (sclerotised) head capsule, chewing mouthparts, and a soft body, that may have hair-like or other projections, 3 pairs of true legs, and up to 5 pairs of prolegs. Most caterpillars are herbivores, but a few are carnivores (some eat ants, aphids or other caterpillars) or detritivores. Larvae are the feeding and growing stages and periodically undergo hormone-induced <b>ecdysis,</b> developing further with each instar, until they undergo the final larval–pupal moult. The larvae of many lepidopteran species will either make a spun casing of silk called a cocoon and pupate inside it, or will pupate in a cell under the ground. In many butterflies, the pupa is suspended from a cremaster and is called a chrysalis.|$|E
500|$|The cysts {{are small}} dark red or violet bubbles {{clustered}} on the host plant's roots. Female cysts are [...] in diameter. Males are {{half the size}} of their female counterparts and smaller in number, with only one male per 500 females. The cysts undergo <b>ecdysis</b> a number of times. When the male larva reaches the third-instar developmental stage, it forms a delicate white cocoon and transforms into a pupa in early June. In late June or early July, females, which are neotenous and retain their larval form, re-emerge from the ground and slowly climb {{to the top of the}} host plant, where they wait until winged adult males, with characteristic plumes at the end of their abdomens, leave the cocoons and join them a few days later. Male imagines (adult insects) do not feed and die shortly after mating, while their female counterparts return underground to lay eggs. After oviposition, the female insects shrink and die.|$|E
2500|$|The {{process of}} {{moulting}} in insects {{begins with the}} separation of the cuticle from the underlying epidermal cells (apolysis) and ends with the shedding of the old cuticle (<b>ecdysis).</b> In many species it is initiated by an increase in the hormone ecdysone. This hormone causes: ...|$|E
2500|$|After moulting, an {{arthropod}} {{is described}} as teneral, a callow; it is [...] "fresh", pale and soft-bodied. Within one or two hours, the cuticle hardens and darkens following a tanning process analogous {{to the production of}} leather. During this short phase the animal expands, since growth is otherwise constrained by the rigidity of the exoskeleton. Growth of the limbs and other parts normally covered by hard exoskeleton is achieved by transfer of body fluids from soft parts before the new skin hardens. A spider with a small abdomen may be undernourished but more probably has recently undergone <b>ecdysis.</b> Some arthropods, especially large insects with tracheal respiration, expand their new exoskeleton by swallowing or otherwise taking in air. The maturation of the structure and colouration of the new exoskeleton might take days or weeks in a long-lived insect; this can make it difficult to identify an individual if it has recently undergone <b>ecdysis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|As a group, springtails {{are highly}} {{sensitive}} to desiccation, {{because of their}} tegumentary respiration. although some species with thin, permeable cuticles {{have been shown to}} resist severe drought by regulating the osmotic pressure of their body fluid. The gregarious behaviour of Collembola, mostly driven by the attractive power of pheromones excreted by adults, gives more chance to every juvenile or adult individual to find suitable, better protected places, where desiccation could be avoided and reproduction and survival rates (thereby fitness) could be kept at an optimum. Sensitivity to drought varies from species to species and increases during <b>ecdysis.</b> Given that springtails are moulting repeatedly during their entire life (an ancestral character in Hexapoda) they spend much time in concealed micro-sites where they can find protection against desiccation and predation during <b>ecdysis,</b> an advantage reinforced by synchronized moulting. The high humidity environment of many caves also favours springtails and there are numerous cave adapted species, including one, Plutomurus ortobalaganensis living [...] down the Krubera Cave.|$|E
2500|$|From the {{embryonic}} stages itself, a {{layer of}} columnar or cuboidal epithelial cells {{gives rise to the}} external cuticle and an internal basement membrane. The majority of insect material is held in the endocuticle. The cuticle provides muscular support and acts as a protective shield as the insect develops. However, since it cannot grow, the external sclerotised part of the cuticle is periodically shed in a process called [...] "moulting". As the time for moulting approaches, most of the exocuticle material is reabsorbed. In moulting, first the old cuticle separates from the epidermis (apolysis). Enzymatic moulting fluid is released between the old cuticle and epidermis, which separates the exocuticle by digesting the endocuticle and sequestering its material for the new cuticle. When the new cuticle has formed sufficiently, the epicuticle and reduced exocuticle are shed in <b>ecdysis.</b>|$|E
