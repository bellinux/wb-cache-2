The aim of scientific research of the article is the study of discrepancy of structural steels quality problem, used for the manufacture of parts and components of mining equipment, established by standards. The goals are also, development and practical application of quality control methods in <b>delivery</b> <b>condition</b> and at all main stages of parts manufacture in accordance with the current state standards. As a result of steel quality complex control in <b>delivery</b> <b>condition,</b> it was possible to identify: the deviation of the chemical composition of steels and alloys, macrodefects, microdefects, deviation in hardness. Practical recommendations to eliminate and reduce and prevent the defects in parts and units used in mining engineering were developed.

As a result, more investigations are performed to understand microstructure and properties.

40|$|Thesis (Ph.

This research experiment integrates affective forecasting (AF) research to study whether the delivery of a psychotherapeutic intervention affects participants' level of impact bias, treatment participation, and outcome. Analyses were conducted on data collected from a longitudinal online experiment completed Fall 2013 - Spring 2014 that randomly assigned participants {{to one of three}} conditions: delivery, delivery AF, or control. It was predicted that <b>delivery</b> <b>condition</b> and AF levels would affect participation and outcome variables. Analyses revealed that the manipulation was unsuccessful at creating a significant difference in AF levels across the intervention groups. Levels of AF were associated with length of time spent on the task at T- 1 and college adjustment. Results had small effect sizes, suggesting that significance was related to the large sample size. Limitations of the study and future directions were discussed. Washington State University, Psychology - Clinica...|$|R
40|$|The study {{investigated}} the role of social reinforcement, when teaching two preschoolers with no functional vocal verbal behavior first instances of echoic responses, using rapid motor imitation responding. The dependent variables for the experiment were: (1) echoic tacts (echoics presented under the controlling variables of tacts) and (2) generalized motor imitation responses to the rapid motor imitation antecedent procedure (Ross & Greer, 2003; Tsiouri & Greer, 2003). Three single case reversal experimental designs were implemented, counterbalanced across two conditions: (1) delivery of praise and social reinforcement contingently upon only correct rapid motor imitation and echoic responses and (2) delivery of generalized social interaction on a fixed time schedule without extinction of correct echoic responses. Results showed {{that the number of}} echoics significantly increased during the contingent social reinforcement condition, when compared with the fixed time <b>delivery</b> <b>condition,</b> during which data consistently remained at a lower level, while motor imitation responding remained at high levels during both experimental conditions. These findings are discussed in terms of: a) whether motor imitation and vocal verbal imitation comprise two different response classes controlled by different setting events, yet may be joined as higher order operant by the procedure used and b) the importance of social reinforcement, when teaching first instances of echoic tacts, through rapid motor imitation responding...|$|R
