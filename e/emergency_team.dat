40|$|ABSTRACT: The safety {{features}} in the car are classified into 3 main groups, depending on {{the time when they}} are used: primary safety prevents an accident; secondary safety is activated automatically after the accident; and tertiary safety starts thereafter. One way to improve this tertiary safety is to establish a fast and effective response by <b>emergency</b> <b>teams</b> involved after the accident. The objective of this work is to analyse the dispatch of emergency services for traffic accidents in Rondes of Barcelona, a close-loop path around Barcelona, with different points of entry and exit. Therefore, the performance of teams operating in this urban road is examined. With that purpose it is developed an algorithm that simulates sequences of accidents and the corresponding response of <b>emergency</b> <b>teams.</b> As a result of the simulation, a data set is obtained and conclusions are extracted. Then, alternative location for <b>emergency</b> <b>teams</b> is proposed and compared with the original solution...|$|R
40|$|Civil {{protection}} and <b>emergency</b> <b>teams</b> work usually under very risky conditions that endanger their lives. One {{of the factors}} contributing to such risks {{is the lack of}} knowledge about their physical environment, especially when working indoors. Mapping and location indoor and outdoor technologies exist; for outdoors, very good levels of precision and accuracy may be obtained using offthe- shelf equipment; on the other side, and although good solutions for indoor environments are available, these require some extra pre-deployed infrastructure in the area to navigate, which is unacceptable in the case of <b>emergency</b> <b>teams.</b> It may be said, then, that no mature indoor + outdoor integrated solution providing the appropriate precision and accuracy for the purposes of <b>emergency</b> <b>teams</b> exist. In this paper, the assessment of a set of currently available sensors (IMUs, RGB-D cameras, GNSS receivers) and algorithms is presented to show that it is already possible to build such a solution relying on them – providing that appropriate (indoor) lightning and texture conditions exist...|$|R

50|$|A rapid {{response}} team (RRT), {{also known as}} a medical <b>emergency</b> <b>team</b> (MET) and high acuity response team (HART), is a team of health care providers that responds to hospitalized patients with early signs of deterioration on non-intensive care units to prevent respiratory or cardiac arrest. The health care providers are trained in early resuscitation interventions and advanced life support and may include a physician, nurse, or respiratory therapist. The RRT, medical <b>emergency</b> <b>team</b> (MET), critical care outreach team (CCOT), and rover team are all different forms of the outgoing component of the {{rapid response}} system. The team responds to calls placed by clinicians or families at the bedside who have detected deterioration. Some teams may also provide care during transport between hospitals, acting as a critical care transport team.|$|E
