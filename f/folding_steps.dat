40|$|AbstractThere is a {{need for}} rules {{allowing}} three-dimensional structure information to be derived from protein sequences. In this work, consideration of an elementary protein <b>folding</b> <b>step</b> allows protein sub-sequences which optimize folding to be derived for any given protein sequence. Classical mechanics applied to this system and the energy conservation law during the elementary <b>folding</b> <b>step</b> yields an equation whose solutions are taken over the field of rational numbers. This formalism is applied to beta-sheets containing two edge strands and at least two central strands. The number of protein sub-sequences optimized for folding per amino acid in beta-strands is shown in particular to predict edge strands from protein sequences. Topological information on beta-strands and loops connecting them is derived for protein sequences with a prediction accuracy of 75 %. The statistical significance of the finding is given. Applications in protein structure prediction are envisioned such as for the quality assessment of protein structure models...|$|R

40|$|Essentially all {{proteins}} {{known to}} fold kinetically in a two-state manner have their N- and C-terminal secondary structural elements in contact, and the terminal elements often dock {{as part of}} the experimentally measurable initial <b>folding</b> <b>step.</b> Conversely, all N–C no-contact proteins studied so far fold by non-two-state kinetics. By comparison, about half of the single domain proteins in the Protein Data Bank have their N- and C-terminal elements in contact, more than expected on a random probability basis but not nearly enough to account for the bias in protein folding. Possible reasons for this bias relate to the mechanisms for initial protein folding, native state stability, and final turnover...|$|R

50|$|Protein <b>folding</b> <b>steps</b> {{involve a}} range of enzymes and {{molecular}} chaperones to coordinate and regulate reactions, in addition to {{a range of}} substrates required in order for the reactions to take place. The most important of these to note are N-linked glycosylation and disulfide bond formation. N-linked glycosylation occurs as soon as the protein sequence passes into the ER through the translocon, where it is glycosylated with a sugar molecule that forms the key ligand for the lectin molecules calreticulin (CRT; soluble in ER lumen) and calnexin (CNX; membrane bound)1. Favoured by the highly oxidizing environment of the ER, protein disulfide isomerases facilitate formation of disulfide bonds, which confer structural stability to the protein in order for it to withstand adverse conditions such as extremes of pH and degradative enzymes.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{there are}} plans to replace the old high-floor tram cars with their <b>folding</b> <b>steps</b> which are used on lines 101 and 107, which share the line with U11 from Essen Hauptbahnhof to Martinstraße.

The current plans envisage the partial lowering of the platforms in the southern tunnel. This would allow the tram on lines 101 and 107 to continue to operate to Bredeney and the future operation of low-floor trams. The high-floor platforms would be slightly elevated and thus would provide stepless entries and exits for line U11 services. However, the operation of three-car sets to the Messe on line U11 through these stations would no longer be possible. A change to low-floor trams on line 107 would be possible in the medium term and the purchase of new of low-floor vehicles is planned from 2012.|$|E

We show that RNA restructuring events coincide {{with the release of}} assembly factors and predict that completion of the head domain is required before the Rio 1 kinase enters the assembly pathway.

In earlier work by others it was shown that plants expressing a mutated form of a chloroplast-targeted Hsp 90 were impaired in the light induction of several nuclear genes.

40|$|Origami-inspired {{engineering}} design is increasingly {{used in the}} development of self-folding structures. The majority of existing self-folding structures either use a bespoke crease pattern to form a single structure, or a universal crease pattern capable of forming numerous structures with multiple <b>folding</b> <b>steps.</b> This paper presents a new approach whereby multiple distinct, rigid-foldable crease patterns are superimposed in the same sheet such that kinematic independence and 1 -DOF mobility of each individual pattern is preserved. This is enabled by the cross-crease vertex, a special configuration consisting of two pairs of collinear crease lines, which is proven here by means of a kinematic analysis to contain two independent 1 -DOF rigid-foldable states.

40|$|Oxidative folding is the {{simultaneous}} process of forming disulphide bonds and native structure in proteins. Pathways of oxidative folding are highly diverse and in eukaryotes are catalysed by protein disulphide isomerases (PDIs). PDI {{consists of four}} thioredoxin-like domains, two of which contain active sites responsible for disulphide interchange reactions. The four domains are arranged in a horseshoe shape with the two active sites facing {{each other at the}} opening of the horseshoe. An extended hydrophobic surface at the bottom of the horseshoe is responsible for non-covalent, hydrophobic interactions with the folding protein. This binding site is capable of distinguishing between fully-folded and partially- or un-folded proteins. PDI is not only a catalyst of the formation of disulphide bonds, but also catalyses <b>folding</b> <b>steps</b> which involve significant conformational change in the folding protein.

The main advantage of the proposed filter is to make it possible to independently control the electrical features of the first and second bands. The behavior of the first band basically depends on the geometry of the outer folded SIR. The second band, however, is strongly influenced by the presence of the inner stub. Additional design flexibility is achieved by allowing the inner stub to be located at an arbitrary position along the high impedance line section of the main SIR.

Determining {{how to get}} a multi-layer 2 D surface is vital to PAB folding. By means of 3 D PAB flattening process simulation, 2 D surface with a minimum area loss is created. This method avoids the traditional measurement of real PAB to obtain 2 D airbag with inaccurate shape and size. After flattening PAB simulation, the 2 D surfaces are meshed with respect to the predefined folding lines. The subsequent <b>folding</b> <b>steps</b> of flat 2 D airbag are carried out according to the folding requirements. Finally, the reference geometry meshing and folded airbag are obtained accurately and rapidly. The static PAB deployment test is modeled using particle method for gas flow to validate this folding method.

40|$|Several {{proteins}} of the mitochondrial intermembrane {{space are}} targeted by internal targeting signals. A class of such proteins with α-helical hairpin structure bridged by two intramolecular disulfides is trapped by a Mia 40 -dependent oxidative process.

Two consecutive induced <b>folding</b> <b>steps</b> are at {{the basis of the}} protein-trapping process. In the first one, Mia 40 functions as a molecular chaperone assisting α-helical folding of the internal targeting signal of the substrate. Subsequently, in a Mia 40 -independent manner, folding of the second substrate helix is induced by the folded targeting signal functioning as a folding scaffold. The Mia 40 -induced folding pathway provides a proof of principle for the general concept that internal targeting signals may operate as a folding nucleus upon compartment-specific activation...|$|E

It has many clients, and these are often recognized through specific adaptors. Recently, the conserved R 2 TP complex {{was identified as a}} key HSP 90 co-chaperone. Current evidences indicate that the HSP 90 /R 2 TP system assembles multi-molecular protein complexes. Strikingly, these comprise basic machineries of gene expression: (1) nuclear RNA polymerases; (2) the snoRNPs, essential to produce ribosomes; and (3) mTOR Complex 1 and 2, which control translational activity and cell growth. Another important substrate is the telomerase RNP, required for continuous cell proliferation. We discuss here the assembly of RNA polymerases in bacteria and eukaryotes, the role of HSP 90 /R 2 TP in this process and in the assembly of snoRNPs and the PIKK family of TORC 1 kinase.

We find that each probe yields different kinetics and compare these observations with a Markov State Model constructed from large-scale molecular dynamics simulations and find a complex network of states that yield different kinetics for different observables.
