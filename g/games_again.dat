5|$|As {{a member}} of the Gobblers {{football}} team, he was the team captain for the South Atlantic Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SAIAA) champion 1918 VPI squad. The season was considered the best in VPI's history at the time. They did not win seven straight <b>games</b> <b>again</b> until 1967. Crisp was the quarterback on the 1919 team. In recognition of his accomplishments as an athlete at VPI, in 1987 Crisp was inducted into the Virginia Tech Sports Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{advised to}} retire several {{times by the}} doctor who worked on his knee, Bavaro managed to secure a {{contract}} in 1992 with the Cleveland Browns, who were coached by former Giants assistant coach Bill Belichick. He played one season for the Browns and managed to appear in all 16 games. After the season, he signed with the Philadelphia Eagles. He played in all 16 <b>games</b> <b>again</b> and had 43 receptions, 481yards, and 6 touchdowns in 1993. After playing one more season for the Eagles he retired in 1995 {{at the age of}} 31. Bavaro finished his nine NFL seasons with 351 receptions for 4,733yards and 39 touchdowns.|$|E
5|$|Los Angeles lost in {{the finals}} to Boston in seven <b>games</b> <b>again</b> in 1966, this time by two points. Down by 16 {{entering}} the fourth quarter, and 10 with {{a minute and a}} half to go, the Lakers mounted a furious rally in the closing moments which fell just short. After dropping to 36 wins and losing in the first round of the 1967 NBA Playoffs, they {{lost in the}} finals to the Celtics again in 1968. Los Angeles moved to a brand-new arena, The Forum, in 1967, after playing seven seasons at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena.|$|E

They competed at the 2012 Olympic <b>Games,</b> <b>again</b> in the Star class, failing to defend their title despite being in the lead throughout the competition, but winning the silver medal. After the Star class {{was removed from the}} Olympic sailing disciplines, Simpson {{turned his attention to the}} America's Cup, moving to San Francisco to train in March 2013. He was known for his athleticism, and for his attention to detail in preparing the boat to obtain the best possible performance.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, 1997–98, Brashear led the NHL in penalty {{minutes and}} set a Canucks franchise record with 372 PIMs, while adding 18 points. During the season, he also received a four-game suspension for delivering a blind-side punch to Ian Laperrière. Brashear stated that he hit Laperrière in retaliation to Laperrière punching Brashear's teammate Gino Odjick from behind. The 1998–99 season marked {{the only time in}} his career which he played in all 82 <b>games,</b> <b>again</b> leading the Canucks in penalty minutes and finishing eighth in the NHL. In the 1999–2000 season, Brashear set a career-high in goals with 11, but the season was marred by one of the most published incidents of excessive violence in the modern era of hockey.|$|E
5|$|After winning 15 <b>games</b> <b>again</b> in 1927, Aldridge {{expected}} a raise, but instead Pittsburgh owner Barney Dreyfuss traded {{him to the}} New York Giants on February 11, 1928, for Burleigh Grimes, citing Aldridge's 4.25 ERA in 1927 as a reason not {{to give him a}} raise. He held out for much of the year; by the time he returned, he was out of shape and pitched poorly. During the time Aldridge refused to report, Giants manager John McGraw threatened Aldridge with less pay, and at one point tried to trade him to the Cincinnati Reds. After the season, in which Aldridge's record was four wins and seven losses with a 4.83 earned run average after 119 innings pitched, he was sent to the Brooklyn Dodgers. However, Aldridge refused to report and retired from baseball instead. His final game was on August 29, 1928.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 1999–2000 NHL season, in a {{pre-season}} game against the Ottawa Senators on September 21, 1999, a puck deflected off Öhlund's stick and struck him in the right eye. The injury forced Öhlund to miss the first 38 games of the season. He underwent surgery to correct his vision and returned to the Canucks the same season and scored 20 points in 42 <b>games,</b> <b>again</b> winning the Babe Pratt Trophy as the Canucks' best defenceman. The following year, he missed an additional 17 games after undergoing surgery once more to relieve building internal pressure on his eye. Playing in his first game back in the lineup on November 28, 2000, Öhlund scored the game-winning goal for the Canucks in a 4–1 win over the Anaheim Mighty Ducks. Öhlund played the final 65 games of the season, scoring 8 goals and 28 points. He also made his NHL playoff debut, recording four points in four games.|$|E
5|$|Van Grunsven {{holds the}} record for winning the most Olympic medals by an equestrian, with nine medals, {{and is the only}} person to have won any equestrian event in three {{successive}} Olympics. She is also the only person to compete at seven successive Olympics in dressage. She has competed in every Olympic Games between 1988 and 2012, winning a total of three gold medals, five silvers and one bronze. At the 1988 Summer Olympics, riding Prisco, she was eliminated in the qualifying rounds of the individual dressage, and was the lowest-scoring member of the fifth-place Dutch team, meaning her score was not used to determine the team's standing. At the 1992 Summer Olympics, her performance improved, and riding Bonfire she took fourth individually and won her first silver medal in the team competition. At the 1996 <b>Games,</b> <b>again</b> riding Bonfire, she won double silver in the individual and team dressage competitions.|$|E
25|$|Yorkshire {{won their}} third {{consecutive}} County Championship title as they, as in 1901, {{went through the}} season with only one defeat from more than 25 <b>games.</b> <b>Again</b> as in 1901, it was Somerset who were the only side to defeat them.|$|E

25|$|A fifth {{match between}} Kasparov and Karpov {{was held in}} New York and Lyon in 1990, with each city hosting 12 <b>games.</b> <b>Again,</b> {{the result was a}} close one with Kasparov winning by a margin of 12½–11½.

25|$|The game is {{sometimes}} alternatively {{known by its}} development title, Dizzy 4, with the Roman numeral IV visible {{at the top of}} the game screen, behind the player's score. A prequel, Into Magicland, was released to promote the game and featured a new character that was never seen in any of the series <b>games</b> <b>again.</b> The game was widely acclaimed by critics across the platforms with scores typically in the 80-95% region. Criticism was leveled at its similarity to previous games in the series and the awkward inventory system. By November 1991 it was noted that the Dizzy games had sold more than half a million units across all platforms. A NES version titled Wonderland Dizzy was developed in 1993 and later released in October 2015.|$|E
25|$|With {{his brother}} {{back in the}} 1937 season he shared the honours again, but {{achieved}} 5–85 against Kent. In the 1938 season he had four 5 wicket innings with a best of 6 for 48 against Sussex. He also made his top run score of 103 runs in 1938 against Warwickshire. In the 1939 season his best bowling was 6 for 44 against Surrey. With {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War, first class cricket was suspended and he didn't have the chance to play first class <b>games</b> <b>again.</b> Pope was a right-hand batsman who played 316 innings in 214 first class matches for Derbyshire with a top score of 103 and an average of 18.38. He was a right-arm off-break and right-arm fast-medium bowler who took 555 first class wickets at an average of 22.54 and a best performance of 7 for 84. He took 5 or more wickets in 22 innings, and took 10 wickets in 3 matches.|$|E
25|$|With the {{consistent}} success of Ultimate's releases there were rumours of a buyout by Ocean, {{until it was}} announced in 1985 that the Stamper brothers had sold the Ultimate catalogue and name to U.S. Gold, who would continue to release games under the Ultimate label. Later titles such as Martianoids and Bubbler were not seen by the gaming press as being up to Ultimate's previously high standards and sales fell. U.S. Gold released no new Ultimate games after Bubbler in 1987. A final Sabreman game, Mire Mare, was trailed in earlier Sabreman games and was mentioned by Sinclair User as being next up for release, but was quietly dropped during development. In late 1988 Rare bought back all the rights sold to U.S. Gold and were reported to be developing <b>games</b> <b>again.</b> Future releases were to have included Solar Jetman, which would eventually appear only on the Nintendo Entertainment System, although home computer conversions for the Commodore 64, Commodore Amiga, and Atari ST were completed by Storm Software, but not released.|$|E

25|$|More recently, {{with the}} {{drafting}} and emergence of Alexander Ovechkin in Washington, and Sidney Crosby in Pittsburgh, the rivalry has heated up again, with controversial comments that Alexander Semin made about Crosby {{in the media}} and physical altercations taking place between Ovechkin and Malkin during games. One of the best series to date between the teams was the 2009 Eastern Conference Semifinals, in which the Capitals took a 2–0 series lead before letting it go once again to be downed in 7 games, ending with a 6–2 Game 7 loss at the Verizon Center. Just like in 1991 and 1992, the Penguins defeated the Capitals in the playoffs en route to the Stanley Cup. The two teams faced off at the 2011 NHL Winter Classic hosted in Pittsburgh at Heinz Field, with the Capitals emerging victorious 3–1, and a hit in the game resulting in Crosby missing nearly all of two seasons with concussion-related issues. The Capitals and Penguins completed their second playoff confrontation in the Ovechkin-Crosby era in the 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs with the Penguins winning in six <b>games,</b> <b>again</b> preceding Pittsburgh's fourth Stanley Cup title. In 2017, the Capitals and Penguins met again in the second round. Pittsburgh gained a 3–1 series lead only to see Washington win the next two games. The Penguins would shut out the Capitals at Verizon Center in Washington to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals and eventually the franchise's fifth Stanley Cup.|$|E
500|$|Similar to its predecessors, Vice City {{generated}} several controversies. It {{has been}} labelled as violent and explicit {{and is considered}} highly controversial by many special interest groups. Peter Hartlaub of SFGate noted the game's [...] "mindless violence", but simply attributed it to the developers' attempt to achieve accuracy. Jeremy Pope, who worked on various Rockstar games including Vice City, vowed never to work on violent <b>games</b> <b>again</b> due to their portrayal in mainstream media. In Australia, the game was pre-edited to receive an MA15+ classification; an uncensored version was released in the region in 2010, retaining its classification.|$|E

First, Reuben Houston, a starting cornerback, was arrested for possession of over one hundred pounds of marijuana. Houston was dismissed from the football team immediately following this arrest but a later court order forced Coach Gailey to allow Houston to return to the team. Houston would see little playing time following the court order.|$|E
